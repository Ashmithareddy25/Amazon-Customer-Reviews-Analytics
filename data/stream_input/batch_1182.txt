B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I have been following 37 signals for a while and this is part of what they try to convey. I think it is a very good book. Not too short, not too long and very clear. I liked it a lot.

0802714544|4.0|Dear Readers<br /><br />I read this book....many years after actually becomming a spy.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have read it before becoming one.<br />Perhaps you would like to know my mission. What my mission was, that is.<br />Perhaps you might think I work for the CIA.<br />When I get more time I'll tell you.<br />Right now I'm in a bit of a rush. Sorry.<br /><br />I suppose we're all spies in some way.....well that's not quite true but well philosophy writers might tell you that we're all philosophers in some way.<br /><br />This book will give you some notions of how just exactly people get used in the spying business not just by the enemy that's easy to deal with but it's always one's own people that are the most dangerous.<br /><br />Also the book will give you some notion of what it is to be a double agent.<br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br />sjw<br />p.s. too bad Matt Damon can't do another Jason Bourne.<br />  maybe he can do some John LeCarre
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I already own this app and I've never regretted buying it. I don't feel bad that I paid for it and now it's free because the developers deserve every penny they get. It knows how fast I thumb type and corrects me almost perfectly! I barely aim for the correct letters and the correct words come out. Get it!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Using to write this review,  the prediction is great,  very easy to use.  Will take some getting used to but so far I'm loving it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|this seems a powerful alternative to the keyboard that shipped with my droid 2 global,  but the omission of alt lock button support is a dealbreaker for any slider phone without dedicated numerical buttons...

B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book is the most riveting novel I have read, and I feel compelled to share this with everyone and encourage people to read it.      The storyline draws you in from the first page, and throughout, I couldn't help but wonder if this could really happen to someone - it's a very terrifying yet intriguing storyline.    The book takes you through a woman's journey with amnesia, but with a twist.  When she goes to sleep each night, she looses all memory of what she did, learned and experienced that day, so each morning she wakes up not remembering anything and has to start over.  She wakes up each morning beside a man that she doesn't know.  He introduces himself to her each day, then goes to work.  She goes through the day looking at pictures he has posted on the mirror of her and him.  A doctor that has worked with her in the past, whom she does not remember, convinces her to start writing a journal of her daily experiences and to hide the book so no one will see it.  She tells him where she will hide it, and he calls her each day, reintroduces himself to her and tells her to go and get her book.  The journal is the only 'memory' she has of the previous days.      What she discovers becomes more disturbing, concerning, conflicting and contradictory each day with what she has written, and she begins to doubt herself as well as her husband, friend, and doctor.    At one point, I wasn't sure where the book was going, and then it slapped me in the face - - -     It is definitely a page turner and I finished the book in two days.  I just couldn't put it down - I had to find out how it ended.  It didn't disappoint me.......

1400031524|4.0|I'd read three other Wallander adventures before reading The Dogs of Riga.    While the story has the same gloomy Swedish atmosphere I enjoy in the other stories, it didn't feel as plausible as the others I've read.   This is the case where Wallander meets Baiba Liepa, who appears in subsequent books.    His adventures in Latvia are detailed but feel less well-informed than usual in Mankell's novels.    That may be because I'm not at all familiar with the political situation in Latvia in 1992, or because Mankell himself was not as familiar with it as he is with southern Sweden.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I read this book in one sitting.  I am not a typical biography reader.  Something really has to capture my interest to pick up a biography.  I am so glad that I read this one!  This is a book that will stay with me always.  As a mother of two young girls, I found myself cringing in some spots.  I found myself crying in others.  Jaycee accomplished a candid, yet in some ways, uplifting account of her time. I applaud her for sharing her story and hope that she knows that it will touch many people - for the better!
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I loved the original SwiftKey, and jumped at the chance to get this upgrade for free.

0812979656|4.0|Rich in language and color and characters. I've read this book twice, which I never do. That's how much I enjoyed it!
0553801473|4.0|Dance!<br /><br />I just finished it last night.  If you just started?  Don't stop!  I wanted sooooo badly to skip ahead and get some hint of what was to come I had to force myself to slow down and take it one impatient step at a time.  Isn't that just like Life Itself?  I think the most valid comment/criticism I've heard so far that I can identify with is the fact that anyone following this Saga and patiently and loyally keeping up with it, is an extraordinary, intelligent reader who has stayed with the entire storyline and character additions, plots and sub-plots so much that we know it just as well, if not better than the writer!  We don't need to be reminded of things, these books were not meant to be read singly, so please?  Let's get ON with it!  I'm as hungry as a Dragon and I need to be fed!<br /><br />I also know that I'm an extraordinarily impatient person and one of my life's lessons is to enjoy and savor what is in front of me today and allow the future to unfold as it will.  Having said all that?  I have also found over the last few years that re-reading has produced for me more ideas, plots and intrigue that I would have otherwise completely missed had I not been forced to go over it again and again for lack of new fodder.  I really and truly appreciate that more than I can say, and interestingly enough?  At the end of Dance, I already KNOW I rushed through it so fast I need to go back and marinade on everything again, lol.  I meant to finish re-reading Feast before I allowed myself to start on Dance but I just didn't have the discipline, sorry.  It was a real struggle, alright?  The new book had just come in and I was ITCHING to get at it.  I convinced myself that I remembered enough from Feast to get started, and then totally succumbed to the lust for MORE of Life in Westeros and beyond.  (It was worth it, hee hee)<br /><br />I suspect that Feast and Dance will be the lull before the final Storm.  I'm hoping that it will end up as \\"Seven\\" books altogether, that would be fitting don't you think?  He needs to regain some momentum with the final books and put us all out of our collective misery of wanting more (and needing some resolution) with no doubt some sort of profound cliffhanger leaving us certain that Westeros will forever be a part of our lives.  He's done such a good job of making this so much like life itself, forever uncertain, and timeless in every way possible.  But even Martin has said that; \\"Death comes to us all,\\" so somehow he needs to bring a death to this, while also adding that magical layer of immortality we know to be the human experience when we look at our collective history and also into our children's eyes at the same time.<br /><br />I can't help but think he had to rush things (sorta) to get Dance out right after HBO Thrones, the timing is too perfect to think otherwise; but I'm so happy with the HBO series I can't really bitch too much.  Maybe he will feel content enough to allow the HBO series to continue while he settles down to finish writing the rest of the thing, but I suspect it will all be about timing after this.  He \\"needs must\\" finish the next book in time to be presentable after the 5th season of HBO is complete.  And they can always make Feast into at least two seasons, or stretch any part of the Saga they want actually.<br /><br />So, here's my best guess.  They'll make two more seasons on HBO with the next two books, start on the 4th Season with Feast (while he finishes up the 6th book) perhaps turn Feast into two seasons while they prepare HBO for Dance, and we won't see anything new for at LEAST 5 more years?  We will all fall in love with the HBO version and hover around our televisions or laptops, watching and re-watching like the addicts we are.<br /><br />If George is kind to us?  He will give us scraps of the future from time to time, and maybe even turn that into a new ploy of possibilities, just like a Priest of R'hllor tempting us by reading the future in theflames?  Whetting our appetite with different versions of what may come?  That would actually be pretty cool.  Maybe I'll write him and suggest that, lol.<br /><br />In the meantime?  I'm going back to Feast to catch myself up some more, and then earnestly going to try to sort out the whole Yunkai, Astapor, Meereen political mess.  If I read another Hzzz something name without understanding who the hell it is?  I'm going to shoot myself.<br /><br />Without telling you anymore?  At this point my best advice is to go to the end of the book and sort out who is WHO among all the players in the Free Cities before you do anything else!<br /><br />Altogether?  Great series, I'm hooked and this book hasn't stopped me from wanting more, not at all.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using the beta of this keyboard for the past month or so, and I'm SO HAPPY IT'S FREE ON AMAZON TODAY! It's the best keyboard i've ever used on my Droid X. The word prediction is generally pretty good and I like that the longpress duration (for special characters) is customizable. I'm not a fan of haptic feedback but that's customizable too. There's a new neon skin that I don't really care for, but it's nice they threw it in!<br /><br />Download this! It's got great features and a good look. The language pack took awhile to download, but over wifi I got it done.
0807014273|5.0|Enough has been said about this little book.  It is captivating to read.  The depth of his insight will leave you wanting to memorize certain passages.  I just finished it but i already want & need to read it again to get a better understanding of it in order to better apply its principles to my life and to those i come in contact with.  This book will go on my short list of must reads of truly great books.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey was one of the free apps a long time ago and I got it but had an epic and didn't have a need. I recently got an evo 3d and quickly put SwiftKey on it and LOVE IT. And now there's an updated version! Rock on!
B00127RAJY|5.0|So I wanted to wait until i had reached level two and really gotten a feel for the workout and noticed some really incredible results. I didnt take measurements before i started.  I had lost 12 pounds just with diet and some walking. I wanted to push myself and get my flabby belly in check, my daughter is 4 yrs old for gods sake.  i have yo-yo'ed btween 138 and 176 .... mostly hovering around 150.  i topped off at 178 this spring and flipped out at 5'4 i just couldnt look in the mirror. So i did the shred 14 of the past 20 days, did six week six pack twice, and BFBM once.  I have lost about 8 or 9 lbs, with a pretty strict diet, keeping it low net carb, protiens, veg, etc. the most important thing is that im fitting in my clothes again, my stomach is a mess, i hate it, but it has flattened out signifigantly! i can almost start to envision a day when i wont constantly be tugging my pants up over the 'overhang'. my husband has dont it w me a couple times and he was a mess!!! he def thought it was a good workout and hes in horrible shape as well. so ill try to update. as of right now, i love jillian, i think shes a great trainer, and i will use her workouts indefinently, i use it on excersize tv whcih is free but they dont have level 3 yet so i might have to buy it.  level 2 is harder than level one, but not undoable. i waited till i was pretty comfortable with level one rather than rush it.  push thru the pain, it gets easier EVERYTIME!!! even my second day, the more i do it the less sore i get, breaks just make me feel worse. its made me more confident, improved my posture, overall happiness and i feel stronger than i have in a long time!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Good idea.  Needs work.  Usage alone would/should predict the proper tense but the system employed seems to favor the near illiterate.  Gingerbread keyboard is better.
B00479SVBU|4.0|There are already a bunch of reviews here that talk about the features, and how the folder structure works, etc. So I won't go over it all again.  It's a great little player/fm-transmitter for a very fair price.  I have yet to hook up my Sansa Clip MP3 player to it since it does a good job just playing directly from an SD card.    One note on the SD card slot:  the pictures led me to believe that the SD card only inserts halfway and sticks out a little, similar to a USB multi-card-reader for a PC.  But it actually has a spring loaded slot like a digital camera and the card mounts flush with the edge of the player, which was a nice surprise.      One gripe I have about it is that the shuffle/random feature seems to get stuck playing the same few dozen songs.  I have over 450 songs loaded on the SD card, but I keep hearing the same songs over and over.   I don't know if it has something to do with Windows Media Player keeping track of the number of times a song is played (I used WMP 10 to sync to my SD card) or what.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a great alternative to the gingerbread keyboard,  its just as fast on my og droid as the built in keyboard.
0670022411|5.0|Diana Bishop is a Yale historian studying alchemy at Oxford. She also happens to be descended from a long line of Witches, including one of the first to be executed in the Salem witch trials. Diana's parents met a grisly end when she was very young, causing her to turn her back on her power and seek a more normal life. She's thrown herself into the study of history, where everything is supposedly black and white and everything has an answer. Or so she thinks, until the day when she places a request for a manuscript that turns out to be enchanted, and has been missing for years.<br /><br />Her ability to retrieve this document attracts the attention of all manner of paranormal creatures, who believe this book holds the secret to their creation and continued existence. Notably among them are Matthew Clairmont, another noted academic who just happens to be a vampire and totally dreamy, and Peter Knox, a well known and powerful witch who has sinister designs of his own for Diana and her untapped power. The question of who to trust has Diana questioning all she believes she knows about her past and her future.<br /><br />I won't go too much further into the plot, so as not to spoil any of the juicy details. It's abundantly clear that Deborah Harkness had a blast writing her novel, as she's included a little bit of everything in its pages. Little historical tidbits (like Matthew receiving a home from Henry VIII) made me *nerdsquee!* as I read the pages, while descriptions of even the mundane were poetic. She takes her characters to some amazing locales, and her descriptions of wine are tantalizing enough to make me wish I were a oenophile. Everything in the story has a personality, from the animals, to the supporting cast and even to the buildings. A fun, lighthearted read that is sure to distract you from the oppressive summer heat! :)
0307454541|4.0|I finally got into reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo this summer after a failed attempt in January right before I started a new school semester. I made it to the first chapter on my first attempt and then the book lay gathering dust on my desk 'till Summer, when I made a second and successful attempt at reading it through. I must say that first and foremost, this novel is highly overrated! Before I go on, I loved this book. For what it actually is, it is a great, clear crime/thriller that absolutely gets you racing through the pages and dying to know what comes next. However, it is definitely not as great as I expected based on the hype it has, so in that sense I have to say it is highly overrated.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this book is great. A pleasant, quick read that by Chapter 2 I was already hooked on. The writing is clear, quick, precise and sharp, all qualities necessary in a good thriller 400+ pages long. Secondly, the murder mystery aspect of it with a select number of potential criminals responsible for such a mysterious disappearance immediately caught my attention and excited to see what came next and ultimately, what the solution to such a complicated mystery was. In the end, it does not disappoint, and had my heart thumping pretty heavily for some of the final, key scenes. The ending especially does a great job of tying up the whole story from the beginning and delivering a satisfying closer, yet with just enough room left open for curiosity of what comes next.<br /><br />Though not as good as The Da Vinci code, or other recent, high-profile thrillers, this novel was fantastic and I greatly enjoyed it. Lisbeth Salander has got to be one of my most favorite characters out of any book I've ever read, and she ultimately was what made this novel wonderful for me. After a series of lackluster reads, I am glad to have finally read something I truly, fully enjoyed.
0553801473|3.0|I pre-ordered this when it was announced as a second half.<br />Since then I've gotten married. I've been deployed twice. I've moved across the Atlantic and back, twice. My eldest left high school, the youngest went to prom. And host of other minor things.<br />Somehow I expected a more from this book given the amount I've done in same time.<br />It repeats parts from the previous. It's filled with details I don't care about. And eventually just bores me. By time things were happening I was barely paying attention.<br />When all was said and done it moved the story along but it was a rough, noisy, unnecessarily long ride.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Not sure what the difference its between swiftkey X and just plain old swiftkey which was free before..... Its ok, but I prefer swype and htc keyboard over it. Not sure why its free again :-(
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the perfect movie candidate.  One gets transported back to the world of Katniss and her love dilemmas that seem somehow naive yet interesting.  Hold on to your seats because right in that moment the adventure really starts and a world of action and secret plots and alliances open up in front of you.  The author keeps you guessing and when you think you figured it out, she throws in another twist that you didn't foresee.  All while there are waves, currents, monkeys and strange birds.  I HIGHLY recommend this book!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is my go-to keyboard.  All other keyboards fail in comparison to this one.  The predictions are scarily accurate and the swipe text is nearly flawless.  I am eagerly awaiting a right or left-handed variation like Samsung has for their note 2 and 3 devices.  That would make this app really over the top.  Good job.
0553801473|5.0|As a huge fan of the SOIAF series, and someone who was more than let down by the last installment I am writing this to alleviate some fears that fans might have that the fifth book in the series might not hold up to all the weight and expectations that were bearing down on this narrative.<br /><br />Some of George's cadence seems a little different from his past books, granted, (and this seemed a bit jarring at first) but overall the book delivers the answers to many of the burning questions that we have had for years (if you have the eyes to see it). However, it is classic RR Martin, it delivers with a compelling story that lets the reader think they have figured out where the firm ground is before they fall through the thin ice.<br /><br />A completely fantastic read and as I write this (I just finished the book) I am very and completely saddened with the idea of waiting another 6 years.
B0000C3I6U|3.0|Viewed: 7/11<br />Rate: 6<br /><br />7/11: Pumping Iron is somewhat of a good documentary, but it still isn't deep as I hoped for. While Arnold Schwarzenegger is bragging about himself and how he plays mind games with others, he and his buddies aren't forthcoming about how they are able to get this big and how did they achieve these results. They don't explain their training regimen, diet plans, or anything like it. We just see them working out although it's not very much to see. Today, as we've seen the results of Performance Enhancement Drugs and anabolic steroids and how a countless of athletes has been caught over the years, bodybuilding has become joke of a sport. In fact, nobody takes the \\"sport\\" seriously at all, and that is the reason why it has been strictly an underground \\"sport\\" because it has never been able to gain an acceptance into the mainstream public. The biggest reason for it is the obvious steroid abuse that all bodybuilders engage in. I used to read Muscle and Fitness back then, and it was comical to me that the writers were promoting bodybuilding to be accepted in the Olympics. Ha...very funny. That's pretty much as it gets because it's where the \\"sport\\" dies. Even worse, Arnold lied about not attending his father's funeral. He also admitted to making up a lot of stories on the film. Oh great, thanks a lot. All in all, Pumping Iron is an okay film, but I didn't learn very much new.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|the series is great but i started noticing a trend by the end of the third book. everyone is going nowhere fast and wasting chapters getting from the privy to the front door.  It is starting to turn into those soap operas where it takes 5 years for john to open the door to find marlina cheating on him with stephano.<br /><br />the story is great but the passing sucks.  you could almost take every chapter of any character and join all the last two pages to quickly read what happen to that character.<br /><br />I also hate how their is no justice in this. noble people honorable people die the cruelest deaths.  The wicked gets a quick painless death after they have had a reward for their bad deeds for months or years.<br /><br />a dance of dragons is a good book for someone needing the next fix of the story but nothing really progresses. what happen to Jon or whoresbane.  I guess il have to wait another 3 year to find out.
B00454U1O2|3.0|I love this CD. However I bought so I could listen to it w/ my 7 yr old. The only clean song is fng perfect and the just dont say anything at that part... which is ok but I ended up buying the radio version- it just sounds better. They other songs still say a@# and bi$#@ so beware I would not of bought this whole cd because of this... I recommend buying the edited songs instead may cost a little more but its more appropriate for the younger kids.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is by far the best chemistry ever between Jane and Mr. Rochester.   The message of Jane overcoming her disadvantaged childhood in dignity, honor, and uncompromising courage comes through and can inspire young women. The film is based on the univerally inspiring story about true love based on patience, true affinity, respect, and appreciation instead of the hurried, impatient love depicted in most modern stories and films. This movie is a high standard to measure against in classic-novel based film projects. The music, costumes, and scenery are enchanting. This film series is among my favorites along with Little Dorrit, Wives and Daughters, North and South, and Cranford.  I would love to see Ruth Wilson again as she was an AMAZING Jane. Also hope to see Toby Stephens cast in another period drama. He would do well as the leading man in any Austen remake -- Period drama/classic novel fans never tire of film versions based on these great stories when done well with the right cast. This film is well worth owning so as to enjoy repeat viewings.
B0015AARJI|1.0|To good to be true! These are the crappiest contollers! The come in what looks like legit packaging.  I noticed the feel of the controller felt cheap, including the buttons on the d-pad.  The seam of one of the controllers was rough around the usb, almost looked like it had been pryed open.  It takes forever to sync.  I should have known better than to buy inexpensive.  Next time I will drop the $55 and go to Gamestop where I will be able to get the real deal.  Stuck with them, maybe I will put them in a yard sale not worth keeping.
1594489505|5.0|My son gave me this book on a Kindle he gave me for my birthday. I didn't think I would be interested at first, but I didn't want to disappoint him so I started reading it. I couldn't put it down and stayed up much later than I intended to, reading! This book has a story line that draws you in and in every part of the book clear to the end you don't want to stop reading. You also learn so much about life in Afghanistan up until after USA came in and from there you can pretty much get the picture. People in America NEED to read this! They will get more understanding of Sharia law and what it really is. Also why we need to take a stand NOW in order NOT to let this law creep into our land AT ALL! They are trying to sneak in. All I can say is that I was surprised by this book and highly recommend it to every reader of every kind! I usually just read Christian books. This will not disappoint you.    Now I want to read his other book Kite Runner.
B0051MKNV8|3.0|LIMITLESS is a film that you want to see succeed - an idea with 'limitless' possibilities, a setting that involves Wall Street (part of our core issue of economic chaos), some interesting camera work, and a a script that likes to make puns.  The problems with the film is that is underdeveloped: main characters are rather two dimensional, cameo characters are walk-on parts without much purpose, and the script, such as it is, relies on voice-over cop out instead of intelligent dialogue.<br /><br />Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper attempting to break away from his guy roles in road show movies) is a wannabe writer - a man who has been attempting to write a novel for years but has not achieved one word on a page.  He lives off his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) who finally gives up on his mess of a life. Eddie moves into a filthy flat and he takes on the appearance of a street person until he encounters his ex-wife's (Anna Friel) brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who gives Eddie a pill called NZT, a medication that is purportedly able to make the brain use 100% of its capacity (fragments of memory, encountered headlines, books slightly read etc all become immediately available to the 'patient').  Eddie, seeing his life going down the toilet, takes the pill and suddenly becomes multilingual, able to figure out number sequences at the gambling table, not only start but finish his novel, etc: in other words, a genius - for the 24 hour duration of the pill's effect. His changed life introduces him to, of course, the stock market where he makes it so big that he garners the attention of  major player Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro) - along with the people involved with the now murdered Vernon  who want the drug back: evil Gennady (Andrew Howard) and his thugs (Eddie  Fernandez and Ray Siegle) a strange 'man in a tan coat' (Tomas Arana) et al.  Eddie struggles through the transition, sells his novel, wins Lindy back, and some years later is running for New York  Senator on his way to the Presidency of the United States.  And that of course leads to the messy ending that began the film.<br /><br />Based on the novel 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn, the screenplay (full of holes perhaps due to the same writer's block as the main character's) is by Leslie Dixon and the film is directed by Neil Burger, a man with some creative ideas who concentrates on gimmicks more than plot and character development. And it does have some dazzling visual effects sequences, courtesy of Joe Willems, cinematographer and Connie Brink, Special Effects Coordinator. It is an obvious attempt to compete with the fast action films that make  so much box office money, but it is flimsy and may be better off in the DVD category - a category in which it landed early for obvious reasons.

B004Y1USV2|3.0|Fly from Here is the best Buggles CD since their first, enhanced by their singer from Mystery replacing Trevor Horn vocals, with back up musicians Howe and Squire from the old progressive rock band Yes. (The drums could be played by anyone.)   Written by Horn/Downes except one excellent Howe tune, the CD is a mixture of pop (fair to poor) and a few excellent more progressive tunes.  They also threw a bone to the backup band with a light acoustic guitar tune by Howe and another weak tune with embarrasing lyrics by Squire, both throw aways.  Three tracks are excellent, and the rest make you wonder about the might have been.  Sad that backup musicians Squire and Howe seem to hit the creative brick wall with no joint compositions on this CD. The singer does a great job of hitting the pristine high notes similar to Trevor Horn in both Buggles and Yes work, sounding nothing like Jon Anderson.  Unfortunately it appears that the print shop accidently packaged this music in a Yes cover by mistake as it appears to have nothing to do with that great band.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a very solid input method to use on your phone.  The predictions are very nice, and generally are actual predictions that you can use rather than just a random guess based on your letters. (though at one point it predicted my IP address that I'm pretty sure I've never entered after I pressed one key... scared me o: ) It really does seem to \\"learn\\" from your imported Gmail, Twitter, and Facebook accounts too.  The predictions are also very handy when doing fast typing and being inaccurate in your taps, as they usually will fill out your sentence as you wanted it, unlike what I felt I was getting with the stock keyboard app.  I was using Swype previously but have recently started trying SwiftKey, and I might stay with it!<br /><br />One note... if you're using a phone and have modified your lcd_density (or perhaps this happens by default on some phones?), then when you open up the app it may open up in a tiny little box rather than full screen and the keyboard won't function.  If you download the app \\"Spare Parts Plus\\" and uncheck the \\"Compatibility mode\\" setting then it will fix this issue.  I'm unsure of what effect it may have on other applications though!<br /><br />Device: Motorola Atrix with Gingerbread
B0041D843M|5.0|If you're one of those people who figuratively cover their ears when others speak about the health benefits of a plant based diet, maybe you don't want to read this book.  If you don't care about your health, maybe you don't want to read this book.  But for everyone else, please read this book.  If you're vegetarian or vegan, it will validate your choices.  If you're on the fence it will convince you to change your life. Even if you are a die hard meat eater, I don't think you can ignore the data in this book.  It's the most unambiguous and convincing report of the effect of nutrition on health that I have ever seen.  And I read books and watch documentaries about this subject constantly.  And I really mean constantly.  I plan to give a copy to everyone I care about.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been looking for a keyboard replacement for and was thrilled to see this free today! I can't believe people who rate it one star because they cannot get thru to their download server when they are getting hammered with all the free downloads. You people should be more tolerant. One star reviews for stupid reasons will cause publishers to stay away.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is downright impressive with its ability to guess the next word you will type, which really speeds up text input. I'm glad I decided to try it!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Take it from someone who has tried every keyboard out there for Android: SwiftKey X is by far the best. It took me less than a minute to write this review using it
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is awesome the way that it is. What I really like most is when I have to single handedly type a message. Its so easy.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Every 30 seconds it has a loading screen (that lasts 5 to 7 seconds) that pauses the game and makes me resume it.  Makes it hard to play/enjoy.  5 stars if fixed.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Darn, I just paid for this. Predicts really well.  Could use a few more words to select from and cursor keys require a few steps to get to. Wish it would auto backspace on an '
0553801473|2.0|This book finally addresses the POV of the some of the characters we all really want to hear about. However, Martin tends to write too much about nothing and has chapters that are completely unnecassary. Furhermore, the only resolve that ever happens is predictably more doom and gloom. FYI . . . I'm only 1/4 of the way into this book and the only way I could possibly be surprised about anything would be for anything to resolve in even a remotely positive way. I know bad things happen to good poeple but so far Martin comes off as a sadist who only likes to upset and frustrate readers. At this point I'm only reading this series becuase of the number of pages already vested. If Martin ever finishes this series (7 books) I am hoping he blows us all away with a fantastic ending. So far, comparing this unfinished work to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is a complete joke. Tolkien he is NOT!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I used to exclusively use swype but it. started to get really weird with its autocorrect so I thought I would give this a try. I was blown away by how fast and inaccurate I could type and everything comes out perfect. the only. thing I wish I could change is the fact that I keep hitting shift instead of &quot;a&quot; and it doesn't do too well with correcting that
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using SwiftKey for about 6 months now and love it. I saw SwiftKey x the other day, but refuse to pay for an application. So happy to see this this morning. So much better than the original.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|it does not work well for &quot;fast typing&quot; style. it drops a significant number of letters to he point where my messages are unreadable unless I type at half speed. back to GB keyboard for me.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is seriously the best thing on Earth. It is simply amazing. I have the Sidekick 4G so typing on the screen isn't the easiest thing because the on screen keyboard is horrible. I am just quickly typing away with this SwiftKey keyboard and I don't know how it can be this smart. It is literally completing my sentences. We were meant for each other. You won't regret getting this. It's free, but I would totally pay up to 10 dollars for it.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I found Gosford Park to be brilliant. I would describe it as combination of a British upstairs/downstairs story line combined with a Clue murder mystery.<br /><br />A calm and mellow paced movie, it plays out with a lot of soft spoken talking and small chit-chat that at first you don't necessarily realize is crucial to the movie plot. While watching a scene, you will find that there is often much going on silently in the background. This is where watching the movie over and over comes into play. Once you know the ending and all of the crucial elements to the story, you can enjoy watching it again and catching all kinds of things going on in the background that you don't notice the first time around.<br /><br />Many different smaller stories unfold for each of the characters throughout the movie. The more times you watch it, you will even discover small stories within larger stories. These smaller plots then all tie into the main murder mystery story. The scenes are almost always filled with many people all together in a room at the same time, so there is always a lot going on to pay attention to.<br /><br />There's a small amount of cursing, no nudity and a few scenes of implied intimacy. There is nothing crude or tasteless that has been added. The majority of the movie is dialogue, no dramatic rescues or heart-pounding chases. I find watching this film that provokes thought and attention to detail a refreshing change from other more dramatic movies.<br /><br />On my \\"Rent\\" or \\"Buy\\" scale, I rate this a definite Buy.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I downloaded this at the beginning of the month and am glad I did. I stayed up for an hour creating things.  Some of the outcomes of certain combos are pretty funny.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|looks great so why do they collect credit card #s and passwords too?   serious issues with that.   so even if they are honest who is to say they wont get hacked for the massive pile of peoples personal data?   UNINSTALL!!!!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I almost bought this on the android market earlier this evening.  I loved the original swift key a lot and I am liking this one just as much.  It includes two additional themes, dark and neon.  it is responsive and accurate. Text prediction is great and it really helps.  Please grab this app today!  Go give it a test drive you cannot go wrong.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey for a few months now, and have loved it! Naturally, if I see the paid version for free I'm going to upgrade. I still love it, but the enter key just gives me a space now instead of a new line. What is the purpose of that??? It's pretty irritating, but hopefully they'll fix it soon. On the free version there was an option on settings that allowed me to choose what I wanted the enter key to do. There isn't one on X. Otherwise, perfectly smooth and my favorite keyboard for android! And I've tried many! 5 stars overall, but developer, PLEASE fix the enter key!! If I have to go back to the free version, I will.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|# 1 keyboard on the marker hands down my choice for the default keyboard on HTC Sensation grab it while its free trust me you wont regret installing it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I first read this book in 5th grade, im 29 now and its still an all time favorite. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to be provoked with thought.  Excellent book.
0553801473|2.0|Seriously.  I find myself skimming over the chapters to 'get to the good parts'.  That tells me I'm bored, and after waiting for this book for so long, it's simply no longer entertaining.  Dani is a waste of time, and I had such high expectations of her.  Tyrion has become the fool he so desparately isn't, and I don't give a crap about all the minor houses that seem to take up a great chunk of the pages and the story.  Jon has been the only saving grace, but I'm afraid even that's wearing thin.  This book is so sadly disappointing.  Like a party you've looked forward to for weeks and weeks, and it turns out to be a big blah.<br /><br />ADDED Aug 1st.  SPOILER:  REALLY?!?!?!  Jon is dead?  WTF?  Couldn't you have killed off Dani?  Cersi?  But JON?!?! Was this bastard so like his father, that it was his honor and steadfast hold on doing what's right that got him killed too?  Aaarrrggggghhhh!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is gotta be the best keyboard out there. The one thing I'd like is more skins,  but the 3 included are awesome already.   If you want a keyboard that you can use super fast and is almost 100% accurate,  this is the one to use.  Thanks to Sarah (Dev team) for keeping her word and letting existing owners of SwiftKey get this update for free.   Thanks Sarah!
B0055OK2T0|5.0|The Adjustment Bureau was a clever and new movie. Not a remake or stolen vision as so many movies today are. The plot was great so was the acting and special fx. This movie started out with an intensity that kept on building right until the final scene. Matt Damon was convincing (as always)as the lead character trying to live his life by his own plans. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a great film. I'm not one of those people who begrudge a movie because it is not \\"enough like the book\\". Movie adaptations of books are the director's and screenplay writer's interpretation of the books not verbatim visual copies. This was a terrific movie and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I just recently paid full price for this... *grumble*. The only thing i don't like is the bottom row. I often hit the period instead of space.
0307946711|2.0|Ever heard that old phrase \\"been there, done that\\".  Well, it could easily apply to David Nicholls  new novel.  Just take one part WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, add two parts SAME TIME NEXT YEAR.  Combine with two tablespoons LOVE STORY, a dash of WUTHERING HEIGHTS and a pinch of DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  Blend well, place in the oven at medium temperature, remove when it's half-baked and the results will be ONE DAY, an over-wrought concoction that never quite rises to the lofty promise of its publicists blurb.<br /><br />In some of the aforementioned movies and books you can observe the life changes and emotional development of characters, be amused and entertained by their antics and look forward to what will happen during their subsequent meetings. In short, most are genuinely likeable human beings whose lives and situations are easy to identify with.  Not so with Nicholls duo, Dex and Emma.  Dex is an egotistic, self indulgent loser and Emma is a fatuous dreamer. In the beginning, you are inclined to empathize with the Emma character, but eventually you decide that she isn't worth your time or your sympathy.  As for Dexter, he is egregiously intolerable throughout.<br /><br />The book truly fails on all counts.  As a love story/romantic tale it misses the mark completely and the comedy aspects of the story are less Noel Coward and more Tina Fey.  Nicholls seems to be bent on the out and out manipulation of his readers by utilizing contrived situations to artificially generate some emotional impact that should have been achieved through the story itself.  If this were a weather report instead of a book review the forecast for this offering would be - - bleak and joyless with few redeeming qualities.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I am just starting out with it, but I like the predictions. They have been very accurate. I barely need to actually type! For the person who wanted to turn off the vibration while typing, go to the advanced features under the setting in keyboard. It is under the haptic settings. I am very pleased with the app of the day today.
B004JK61K0|5.0|I've been using K-9 mail for almost a year now (samsung epic) for pop3 email.  It helps me keep an eye on work emails when I'm not at my desk.  I like the fact that I can set it up so it always shows the most recent 25 emails, so I'm not always having to manually delete past emails from my phone.  This is particularly useful after going on vacation...I prefer to reply to emails via my laptop, and file them in folders accordingly.  I don't want to see the 1100 emails that I received when I was away and have to manually delete them from my phone.  If I need to see the last 50 or 100 or more emails, it will fetch them on demand.  If I delete an email via my phone, it is deleted from the server (this is a setup option).    For those who prefer to have a perfect sync between their laptop and their phone email, K-9 does that, too.  You can even set up folders and categorize your emails on your phone.    I like that it's very customizable (notifications, email signature, screen behavior, multiple accounts, frequency of checking for emails etc.).      Note:  a few weeks ago I started having problems with K-9 not fetching my emails.  I reinstalled it and it works fine again.  Great program at a great price!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I like being able to group apps into folders that I can shortcut on my home screen. FolderOrganizer makes it much easier to add multiple apps at once to a folder (vs. using stock Android folders). Also like being able to assign custom icons. The best feature is how it asks me (via a notification) if I want to add a newly installed app to a folder.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie is a very subtle comedic genius of a movie.  All of the actors and actresses are marvelous.  This is one of the must see movies.  My 13 year old son watched this with my husband and myself and he loved it.  You have a cast of actors (Truman Capote, Peter Falk, Alec Guiness, David Nivens, James Coco and Peter Sellers (playing the Chinese Guy) to the Actresses (Eileen Brennan, Maggie Smith and Nancy Walker).  For those of you who have not seen this please go out and buy this/ rent this movie and please let me know what you think.      Here is my email address:  elmophish@hotmail.com
B00004S8X5|5.0|the album is very good & worth buying it even includes the remake of a classic cover song loco motion
B004P7CN5O|3.0|DVD was not fixated in case. Inner spindle was broken.    Poor reproduction of original, but @price I purchased for ($4.84)it's acceptable
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I got this just a bit ago and love it. I use the rapid style typing and it auto corrects much better on my htc inspire than does the standard keyboard.       (EDIT): The keyboard now removes spaces and duplicate letters when holding the button to make the thing go back when you want to edit what you have typed in. FIX IT and the rating will go back to 5 stars.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used a plethora of different keyboards on android in an attempt to find the one that works best for me. I've been using SwiftKey for about a year now, and it is definitely the one that works best for me. After a while you only have to tap a letter or two and it already knows what word you want to say... and usually the word after it as well. The predictions are top notch after it learns your speech patterns.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The title of this review was typed without using any letters,  this keyboard predicts what you will type before you even start typing!   Bought this on Google marketplace a few months back,  it's simply awesome. Totally worth $4, a steal for free.  After downloading, it walks you through the installation, holding your hand all the way. After downloading a language,  it scans your text messages to see how you talk.  After use it seems to continually adapt to your common pattens and words.  AWESOME.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|When Jaycee was taken I was too young to know what was going in the news. I am 23 years old now found about this wonderful woman not long ago. I learned what she went through keeping up with the news now that I am older, and when I discovered she had written a book I knew I had to read it and couldn't wait to. I read this book wihtin 2 days. It's one of those books that you cannot stop reading and you want to keep on reading to find out what happens next. It has been one of the best books that I read in a loong time. All I have to day that Jaycee Dugard is strong and incredible woman!
B000000OXH|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Asia fan, saw them live in Cleveland in 1983 just before this album was released.    It is a pity that these 10 fine songs were sabotaged by terrible mixing and production values.  The vocals, keyboards, and guitar all collide together in the upper octaves, while the bass and drums sound like they were recorded with a wet cardboard box over the microphone, giving the bottom a flat sound.  The end result is a huge hole in the middle octaves of each song.    Even when I had purchased the vinyl record in 1983, and recorded it onto a quality cassette tape (I know that I am dating myself), it never sounded \\"right\\".    This review is written after several listens on headphones to the remastered \\"Gold\\" series compact discs.    Considering the gravitas of these four talented musicians, I can only imagine that this sound mix was forced on them by the record company.    True justice would be to have the 4 musicians rework and re-record this entire album (they can call it \\"Alpha Beta\\"  or something similar).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have a Motorola Droid X phone, which is about 1 year old, not one of those latest smartphones. SwiftKey X keyboard is so much better than my old keyboard. I particularly like the \\".com\\" button. It is not showing in the published pictures but this .com button is there as a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey X improves on the previous version with better predictions and themes. I've tried other keyboards but always come back to this one.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a great bag for beginners. Will fit enough equipment for a non-pro photographer with a full body, a couple lensess and some other accesories
B005D9MUWY|1.0|i couldn't get past step 1 - download your language (and I used Wi-fi as recommended).  Would time itself out 3/4 of the way.  i have the Sprint Samsung Transform.
B00005N6KG|1.0|When I purchased these headphones I looked at the reviews first. There were some who liked it and some who didn't, because it did not last long. So I took a chance and that chance has cost me! I had these headphones for about four months before the headphones gave out on me. The sound was good, it fits in my ear comfortably, and they did not break. I used these head phones almost everyday. So I have to give this review and convince you.........DO NOT BUY!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST FOR YEARS AND NOT MONTHS!!! Because you will end up throwing your money away!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Dont download. they lied. Its not working at all. Keep saying, fail to download language plz check wifi connection. Now i know why its free for today!. - Samsung Galaxy 5
B005D9MUWY|1.0|o let me download the language pack while im on wifi. nope aparently i need a data connection to download it. well my wifi is working just fine. it even tells me that it prefers to download over wifi....what a complete fail
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I got this through Amazon's daily free app promo, but I'd have bought this months ago if I'd known how much it'd simplify my life! It's a must-have app. The sorting abilities and long list of customization offered may require an initial time investment, but it'll quickly pay off in ease of use. Constructive Criticism: I could go for more preloaded icon themes / color schemes.
0553801473|3.0|I have given over ten years of my life to this series.  I have reread the books several times while waiting for the next one.  I am now 67 years old and it is only a question of whether it will be my death or Mr. Martin's which will deny me a conclusion of the major conflicts.  I am trapped into buying the book by my foolish hopes and therby enrich the author beyond what he deserves. Maybe the pressure by the movie aspect will cause him to move along. This book is about on a par with \\"Crows\\".  Not the best but adequate.  Come on, George, get on with it.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This movie is about the Beatles, but more as a movie and not a documentory which makes it more fun. this movie is very random, but very entertaining. If your a Beatle fan then this is the movie for you. You get to see them perform 'Help', 'Your gonna lose that girl', 'Ticket to ride', 'Another Girl', 'You've got to hide your love away', 'I need you', and 'The Night Before'. Make sure to use the subtitles because they are kind of hard to understand sometimes.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a great way to text.  I highly recommend this to anyone who uses texting.  The voice recognition is very good and gives a few variations of your interpreted voice message.  Simply choose the correct sentence from a few variations.  Much better than erasing and starting over.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Is one of those things that you just have to try it for yourself. I like it better than the HTC sense 3.0 keyboard.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Dang, I already paid for this a week or so ago on the Android Market!  This has to be the best keyboard out there!  It learns from your Gmail account and other accounts to help with the predictive text and how you spell things.  That is one of the most amazing features.  It eventually learns and is able to predict what you want to type.  The layout for this keyboard is great and the few skins that it comes with are awesome.<br /><br />I was using Swype before this one, and it was great, except for the fact that is wasn't too intuitive.  Even when this stops being free on here, this keyboard is still worth it to buy.  Everyone should pick this up today while it is free, for sure!  You will be glad that you did!
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|This case is easy to put on and take off and provides extra grip for a sometimes-slippery phone. It fits fairly well--a little loose for my taste, but at least it doesn't obscure any of the phone's controls. It adds only a slight amount of weight and a little bulk, and it provides good resistance to scratches and a small amount of protection if the phone is dropped. It looks fine: not exactly stylish, but certainly not ugly. A sort of masculine look. Aside from the loose fit, the biggest downside is that the case doesn't come with a protective cover for the screen, so you'll have to buy that separately. It's a good value for the price.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is one of Marvel comics lesser known heros. So when Marvel decided to make a movie about Thor I felt that they were getting greedy due to the success of Iron Man. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Thor is a wonderful movie. Wonderful for many reasons. First it has a sense of humor. This movie is all about fantasy and fun. Thor is the God of Thunder and Chris Hemsworth looks every bit the part. He is dashingly handsome and buff and arrogant yet Hemsworth's talent is such that you never resent him for being arrogant. He's a lovable cocky big lug. The movie starts with Thor on his home planet of Asgard. Thor wants to confront his mortal enemies the Ice Giants, his father Odin, played expertly by the legendary Anthony Hopkins wants diplomacy to prevail. Yet Thor presses the issue and this breach gets him exiled to Earth without his powers only his all powerful hammer Mjolnir which carries the power of an entire planet. Thor on Earth is both hilarious and arrogant at once. Hemsworth is talented enough to pull this off. I laughed when a nurse draws blood from Thor and Thor bellows: \\"How dare you attack the Son of Odin!\\" It is that kind of humor that makes this movie so good it's a perfect blend of humor, action and great acting. Hemsworth is a stunning revelation hopefully he will get great roles in the future to make him a huge star because he's a great looking guy with a great body and all the acting talent to back up his looks. Natalie Portman plays the love interest but this love affair is not the overwhelming forced sexfest of most action movies. Instead this love affair is sweet and romantic. It reminds me of the love affair between Lois Lane and Superman in the original Superman movie from 1977. Watching Portman's character and Thor kiss at the end of the movie actually means something. A lot more than all the gritty sex scenes in most action films. Thor is a perfect summer movie full of fun, humor a little action and a sweet romance. 5 stars all the way!!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I hadn't thought about it before but I bought these in time for the 42nd anniversary. Only after watching this did it dawn on me that we were rapidly approaching that date. I know I have always liked Tom Hanks as an actor and human being but after watching this series and understanding his devotion to our adventures into space, I need to revisit my collection of his videos and maybe upgrade them to Blu-Ray. Won't put much in his pocket but about the only way I can say thanks for all of his hard work as a straight up actor. During his commentary on the extra disk he mentioned he wanted everyone to come away with a total appreciation of the Apollo missions and to have people say to themselves, \\"I never knew that happened\\". Right on target Mr. Hanks and again, thank you for your endeavors.<br /><br />Also worth watching is Ron Howard's \\"In the shadow of the Moon\\" created in 2007. Excellent presentation of how the Astronauts fealt about their work and adventures. While I have never had the pleasure of meeting any of these legends, you get a sense of what it meant to them to fly these missions. Wish I could thank all of them for their fantastic accomplishments. In my Navy retirement (Avionics) shadow box I put a small Apollo 11 medalion in the number one spot since it was this mission that generated my interest in space travel and Aerospace. Rambled on about myself in this one but this series prompted me to say thanks in one fashion or another.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I cried. I was amazed. Jaycee is so great and I Cannot believe she survived life without her mother for so long.  She writes so simply and it is so sad when Jaycee writes about the time she spends her first three months without light.  I don't know what to say without spoiling the book.  She is a good mom.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I discovered the music of Imelda May on a Facebook post by Shirley Manson of Garbage.  Shirley had such great things to say about Miss May, that I HAD to listen.  Her first album \\"Love Tattoo\\" had me hooked!  Usually with such a solid first album, most artist's second efforts can sometimes disappoint.  I dare say I love this album even more than her first.  Her sexy siren vocals mixed with the amazing musicians on the album are purely addictive.  She can go from a blues growl to a punk rock howl in a heartbeat, often making your own skip one.  I have been lucky to see her live twice and let me tell you, her voice is not just studio magic, this lady can sing!  If you're looking for someone new, whether you typically like Rockabilly and Psychobilly or not, I think you'll be pleased!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I'm not a big fan of typing prediction engines. No matter how accurate they are and how well the AI engine \\"learns\\" I end up spending more time deleting and retyping than anything else. To me this app is 4-star worth just for having the simple yet often overlooked \\"arrow keys\\" as well as having themes and customizable gestures that aren't available with stock keyboard nor on custom ROMs. Cannot begin to describe how useful and time-saving those arrow keys are. I hate having to rely on dragging the cursor by tough in order to fix a typo or to change sentence structure. Overall, this app is well worth the download; more so today that's an amazon freebie.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I'm a heavy sleeper that likes to hit the snooze button so the fact that you have to solve math problems to wake up is genius. And if you think you can just turn your phone off,  you can't because they'll still make up solve math problems when you turn it back on. I recommend setting the math difficulty to \\"hardest\\" because it will make you get up and find a calculator (unless you're a math prodigy!) And if you don't like the sound of alarm clocks,  you can pick your own music and wake up blissfully.  I got this application for free but I wouldn't mind paying for it because it's worth it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Two days ago I put a new (certified, not hacked) operating system (Froyo) on my phone and the keyboard was atrocious (dictionary not complete, auto-complete completing words pulled from my CONTACTS list instead of any sort of human-language dictionary, etc.....terrible, terrible, terrible) and Amazon couldn't have offered this as the free-app-of-the-day at a better time (I didn't even realize I could download such an app).  Granted, I've had it for all of about 20 minutes now, but it's SO SO SO much better than what I've been dealing with for the past two days and the predictive text/auto complete is EXCELLENT.  Highly recommend, especially if you're getting a $4 app for free!<br /><br />UPDATE: Until two days ago I'd used this for nine months on my old phone and continued to love it.  Two days ago I got a Galaxy Nexus, and I'd been using the keyboard that came with Ice Cream Sandwich, which was fine, BUT I didn't realize how much I'd taken for granted how predictive the SwiftKey X app really is, and reinstalled it this morning. I like the keyboard layout better, too, which doesn't require me shifting to the alternate screen to get most symbols, and the numbers are on a numeric keypad, which is SO much better than being laid out across the top of the keyboard.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been trying to use Swype for some time now, but just yesterday decided to go back to the stock keyboard.  THEN today I see SwiftKey X FOR FREE! It ROCKS!! Very easy to use and GREAT prediction! Simple, Fast, & Efficient!
0061726826|5.0|First off let me commend Lauren Oliver's writing, it is lovely and I believe that really shines through with Delirium. With that said, I found the book to be a little slow at first because she really set out to give her readers the background and establishing that took awhile, but past that the society in which she describes is enthralling. A place where love is not spoken of and thought of as a disease. Lena, the main character is at first conforming to her society's expectations but at the book progresses you see her change into a different person as her thoughts of the place where she lives is drastically changed. Her relationship with Alex only seems to blossom as the book progresses and from there Oliver without a doubt puts together a masterpiece. Every word she writes is so carefully chosen that it plays a role major on in the story. By the end I was in tears because of not only the connection I felt to the characters but the beauty in which she displayed it that had me completely fooled. So with that said you need to read this book. It has been 3 days since I have finished it and it is still fresh in mind. Without a doubt, after you finish this book you will be dwelling on the final words Lauren Oliver leaves you with, that are hauntingly beautiful.
B000022TSW|3.0|The show Is hilarious but the movie is nothing but a extended episode.I love the vulgar parts but the rest isn't nothing new.Nothing special at ALL.Still good though.And it arrived very quickly.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I purchased SwiftKey about five months ago and will never go back. Easily cuts my texting/typing time in half. Fast and user friendly interface.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I previously used the original swiftkey keyboard and liked it very much.  upon downloading swiftkey I ran into a couple problems which involved me uninstalling and reinstalling the application,  followed by restarting my phone,  followed by some persistence to download the language pack.  After all that,  the keyboard worked well.  I miss the autocapitalization at the beginning of a sentence,  but it's not a big deal.  the personalization of the keyboard look however limited,  is classy and stylish.
0312944926|3.0|I am no tech so I cannot vouch for whether the information in this book was accurate.  I wanted something mind-numbingly entertaining, and Dan Brown's books always deliver on this front.  I've read his other books (\\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\") and found this one quite similar.  I have to read Dan Brown no more frequently than every 2 years.  There is always a hot guy who is just incredibly smart.  Then there is an even hotter and smarter chick whose legs every man likes to ogle.  Together, this pair has got to overcome some incredible circumstance to create a farfetched plot for a book.  A typical Dan Brown book.  Very fast-paced and entertaining if you don't think about things too much!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|In this superb conclusion to the tale we've been following for over a decade, the intrepid Harry Potter finds that only by satisfying his hankering for Horcruxes can he hope to defeat the dark lord. Most of the film is spent following his search for these last few objects, and what could have been a tedious series of fetch quests is kept from falling into the realms of boredom by a sense of pacing so perfect the future film student in me started taking notes. Admittedly, my last movie experience was Transformers: Dark of the Moon, a \\"film\\" with such atrociously jarring momentum that I nearly disgorged my five dollar hot dog (but five dollars is five dollars, so I willed it down). Even though anything will seem well-paced by comparison, I haven't been so blown away by such artful interweaving of action and calm, fear and love, and an ensemble cast, since, well, ever.<br /><br />[Warning: Contains SPOILERS!]<br /><br />The most powerful example of this is when Harry ends up alone in the Forbidden Forest in the middle of the giant showdown between good and evil. After seeing young students cut down by death eaters as they tried to hold their own in a war that was far beyond them, after witnessing stone statues come to life and make battle with club-wielding giants, after bridges burn, forcefields collapse, and spirits break, after dementors are driven off by those who refuse to relinquish their hope, we find ourselves in a clearing of silence.<br /><br />Turning the resurrection stone in hand, Harry is suddenly accompanied by the ghosts of those he cares most deeply for: Sirius, Lupin, and his parents. Their undying love for him brought tears to my eyes, for it is a love that continued into the afterlife not thanks to some magic, but because all those who have left us live on in our hearts. The writing was beautiful, the acting sublime. The calm in the center of the storm, this one scene is a masterpiece of pacing.<br /><br />The rest of the storm was nothing to shake a stick at either, not that shaking a stick at a storm is really that common of an activity. In fact, I'm not sure that it would accomplish much of anything, unless the stick is a wand and you have control over the weather. Then it would definitely help. Anyway, the point of all this is to say that, while the emotional punch packed by Deathly Hallows Part 2 is nothing to shake a wand at, the visuals are equally impressive.<br /><br />For instance, cast your imagination gaze on Gringotts. Its labyrinthine rollercoaster-tangle transportation system is a wild ride that puts every Six Flags everywhere to shame, especially since it ends with a dragon. Now, a lot of movies have done dragons (Harry Potter included), but this was potentially my favorite CGI beastie ever (don't worry, Toothless. No one can replace you). The dragon was not a glorious mount of yore, but rather an emaciated, abject figure, trapped underground for his natural life, chains cutting into his majesty and leaving nothing but raw, bloody hopelessness. The creature instantly evokes overwhelming pity, something I've rarely witnessed from CGI.<br /><br />Dragons are basically my favorite, but if there's one thing I love more, it's love itself. We all knew the Ron Hermione romance was going to come to a head. The only question was, after so many years of buildup, could the climax do it justice? I, for one, say that nothing has ever been more just. You know that moment in truth or dare when someone asks you your most seductive fantasy and you finally let spill the secret you've never told anyone? You launch into graphic detail, explaining that it's all about thrusting your basilisk fang into a goblet-shaped Horcrux in the Chamber of Secrets while under attack from a giant watery snake that eventually comes crashes over you? We've all been there. Everybody gives you these weird looks, as if that's somehow not the hottest thing ever. Ron and Hermione certainly thought it was, because they immediately launchinto a passionate kiss that had the theater cheering up a storm.<br /><br />Perhaps the most beautiful scene is the one bathed all in white. Halfway between life and death, Harry finds himself in King's Cross Station, his own personal limbo. There, the sage and mysterious Dumbledore delivers some of the most compelling wisdom in years of cinema. The English major in me rejoiced when such a beloved figure told us that words are the most powerful magic, able to do great harm but also to heal. I'm using words right now, and man do I feel mighty. And when Harry asked \\"Is this all just in my head or is it real?\\" and Dumbledore responded with \\"Of course it's in your head, but that doesn't mean it's not real.\\" Gah! So sagacious!<br /><br />But enough nonsensical gushing. As perfect as this movie was (and it was), there were still a few things that I would've done differently. The whole series is about the battle between Harry and Voldemort; this is a showdown ten years in the making, and I wanted it to be perfect. The buildup was there, but when the final blow was dealt, it felt understated. Voldemort simply drifts away into nothingness. If it were me, I'd have Harry explain the entire Deathly Hallows wand switching thing while the two of them struggled against each other, beams of energy locked in a pulsing impasse. Then, as soon as it became clear that Harry was going to win, he'd shout \\"Avada Kedavra!\\" and Voldemort would EXPLODE. That's how a dark lord goes out.<br /><br />In fact, I could go for a lot more spell shouting in general. Aberforth Dumbledore should've bellowed \\"Expecto Patronum!\\" before taking care of all those dementors, and Molly Weasley definitely needed to scream some serious stuff at Bellatrix before the end. And I know it would've gone against the books and fans everywhere would have gone on a David Yates manhunt, but I could've done without that 19 years later scene. I just don't think it works in the film version.<br /><br />After having been underwhelmed year after year by subpar adaptations of the formative novels of my youth, finally have I received the cinematic experience I've long craved. At long last, we are given epic battles of half-giant proportions, momentous stakes that belie the series' light-hearted origins, and characters whose superb performances tug at our dragon-heart strings. At long last, we have a film that is truly magical.<br /><br />Score: 5/5 ¢<br /><br />Also, let it be noted that Neville is a champion.<br /><br />Check out more on \\"The Nickel Screen\\" (Google it!)orm.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|just started using but so far it's amazing. can't believe I lived without. my favorite is the arrow keys. also the long press is a nice touch.
B003GR90E6|5.0|Great sandals. Impossible to find @ retail in my size (14), so glad they were here. Very pleased with the product.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had a small issue downloading the English language pack, but gave it a few more tries and was able to successfully download it. I'd been using the beta for a while now and when I learned that I would soon have to pay for it, I was a tad disappointed, but was willing to shell out the few bucks it cost in order to continue using it. Let's face it, this keyboard is better than any stock keyboard any Android phone is going to have. I check the daily free app every day and only buy my apps off of Amazon now, since it's a pain switching your main account on your phone (and by doing so, giving up the rights to apps you purchased while using another email account). To find that this was a free app of the day delighted me, since I missed the time frame where the app was only $2.
B000001FS6|4.0|Having just seen U2 in St. Louis on the 360 tour, I've been all U2 all the time for the past few days.  I must ashamedly admit its' a bit of fun reading through these reviews and how the consensus can really  differ from critics reviews.    Rattle and Hum is a good album. Though it gets a bit bloated and full of itself it did give us Desire,  Angel of Harlem and All I Want is You.  And lets face it...the amazing Achtung reinvention was in part  a response to the critical backlash of R&H.    What if the lads had pared back the album and packed it with good,quality tunes. We only needed the live  songs during the movie anyway. Here then is Rattle and Hum 2.0  Is there a cooler way to kick off a U2 record then with Edge's quick strum on Desire?  A Room at the Heartbreak Hotel is a terrific b-side from that era, and sorry Bob but Love Rescue Me is a middling bore.  Let me know what you think.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have typed entire sentences by only typing a letter or two of each word. This app was already the best keyboard, and now they added arrow keys! Awesome!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I guess not since I'm typing this with my htc Thunderbolt.. great app! no issues whatsoever. thanks for the freebie
159420229X|3.0|Initially I thought that this book would entail more about memory techniques.  Instead it details the competitions which are not the same thing.  The concept of mapping is interesting. What is stated is that if there are no differences then it will not really be memorable.  For example if you were asked to remember what you had for breakfast say three weeks ago you probably don't remember it. Why? Because it is breakfast it is a common daily event. What it suggests is that you create a mnemonic device for a given thought or lay it out in a place that you remember. There is also a debate within the book if someone is a savant or simply memorizing.    It does mention that the debate between knowledge being written versus being known goes back thousands of years.  If it is argued that memorizing things is wrong then why not simply just reduce all knowledge to a given textual form and just eliminate education.  If it is argued that writing actual data down is wrong then the efficiencies of the modern era would be nullified. So naturally a balance would have to be established.    The book is not bad but the title implied it would be much more than what it has.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used the default Droid 1 keyboard and the Flext9 keyboard app.  The default kb was decent.  The Flext9 kb was decent but it had a number of slowdown issues and would freeze.  This app is amazingly fast and much easier to push the buttons.  I am not a fast texter but this has made texting infinitely easier.  Definitely download this app if you are looking for an easier to use and versatile kb.  Also, it is able to look at other accounts you have to learn common words so it makes fewer mistakes.  I love it!  You will not be disappointed.
0345505387|4.0|I'm sorry to say the horses are awful,contorted into poses that are impossible.  Missing bridle parts,saddle parts,horse parts!  Jamie and Clare look wonderful.  I base my opinion only on seeing the \\"look inside\\" feature.
0345529057|5.0|These are the first books I've read of George R. R. Martin's. So I wasn't familiar with his writing style, but I watched the first season of Game of Thrones on HBO, loved it, and decided with the summer approaching this would be a good series to read over the summer. I bought the 4-Book Boxed Set and as soon as I read the first chapter I was hooked! Martin has a very unique writing style, one that is very colorful and well worded. He takes you into this unbelievably believable world that he's come up with and you are completely enchanted by it. He approaches each chapter through one characters views. A third-person limited narrative. He's really very clever and although I haven't finished the set yet, I can't seem to put the books down.
B004XQO90O|5.0|This movie was the best one I've seen this year (besides Pirates of the Caribbean 4). It was clean too, which was really refreshing. All action! No kissy kissy. REALLY GOOD!
1563899426|5.0|Fables is one of my favorite series. I love the graphics and the story lines and a huge fan of fairy tales, it really is everything I could have hoped for. It's definitely an adult series with some graphic scenes. I loved the mystery in this first book and have reread it a couple of times. It's definitely a series I recommend to anyone who enjoys both graphic novels and fairy tales.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I have been using Flex T9 for quite a while and when I saw SwiftKey X as the free app of the day today, I thought I would give it a shot.    I did not even get through the setup before this keyboard app had me frustrated. While trying to setup the \\"auto-learn\\", I tried entering my email address, it starts with 'j.' every time i typed it, SwiftKey X would change it to 'K.'. No matter how many times I backspaced it out and re-typed 'j.', SwiftKey X whould change it to 'K.'. I am sure there is a way to say no I really want to use 'j.' but it is not user friendly or intuitive in changing its auto-corrections.    So here is my pros and cons list:    Pros:  - I like that it will try to learn your typing style from SMS, Facebook, gmail.  - I like that when it is setting up for it to learn your typing style, you have control over where it will look to learn from (SMS, Facebook, gmail).    Cons:  - Biggest is that there is no \\"Swype' or drag style input.  - Hard to change the auto-corrections (not intuitive or user friendly to change).
006441034X|5.0|Why I read this: When I heard that the amazing Diana Wynne Jones had passed, I decided it was time to read the books I had been meaning to for some time. And this was one of them. I loved the animated movie and figured the book would be even better.<br /><br />Plot: Sophie is definitely not the luckiest girl. In fact, she doesn't seem all that mad when she gets turned into an old woman. Then she ends up in the incredible moving castle of Howl, a supposedly evil wizard who steals away and kills young maidens. But there's more behind Howl and the reason his castle is floating. I really can't say too much about this plot other than it is absolutely magical. I just loved it.<br /><br />Characters: Howl is possibly the most interesting character I've read in a long time. He's quirky and moody and seems not all together there. Sophie herself makes an interesting old woman and it's her voice that we view the book through. I just love all of Jones' characters. They're so unique and wonderful, even the bad ones.<br /><br />Relatability: Fans of high fantasy with well-developed characters will be begging for more of her books after reading this one. For such a long book it read rather fast as well.<br /><br />Cover Commentary: There's so many covers of this book, it's insane. I really quite like the one I have. It's a bit brighter than some of the others. Not sure if that's how I quite pictured the castle though.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Overall this is exactly what I want in a keyboard. The swiftkey x makes typing a breeze on my phone. I have large hands and the error correction is a life saver. The only thing is I struggle with the non-capitalization after a period, return key should be where delete is and sometimes I type out full words and it still thinks that it is another word.
0525422943|5.0|Why I read this: I just loved If I Stay. LOVED it, so when I heard there was a sequel, I had to pick it up. When it appeared on my doorstep it was like fate. :)<br /><br />Plot: Taking off a few years later from If I Stay, this book is from the point of view of Adam, who is a successful rock star, yet he feels like the world is slowly tumbling down around him. Without Mia, he seems to have little purpose and is a wealth of emotions that are ready to overflow. A chance meeting will change his life forever. I just loved the rawness in this book. There's such a twist in your heart as you read this sequel to a book that did just the same. I love the way this book played out, it was absolutely magical and absolutely realistic all at once.<br /><br />Characters: Adam is such a wreck when we meet him at the beginning of this book. A lovable wreck, but definitely a walking disaster. I love the world we get a peak into with this book, with the infamy aspect of being a famous musician. You almost hate Mia when she comes back into the picture, but Adam's love is so huge you can't help but start to forgive her.<br /><br />Relatability: Anyone can relate to this, those who have lost someone or lost touch with someone, people who are musicians, those who have had relationships.. there's so much in here that anyone could relate to.<br /><br />Cover Commentary: Love it. :)
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I bought this knife after looking for high carbon survival knives. The reviews were good enough for me to make the investment.<br /> This knife is better than I expected, the blade is 1/4\\" thick and is shave sharp, my arms can prove it. The sheath is not leather, but has lots of nice features, snaps and clips not just velcro. The weight makes it great for choping and batoning wood.<br /> My best friends wife bought him a USMC Ka-Bar knife and after I showed him this one, he fell in love with it. After I told him the price his wife kicked me..lol If you are looking for great camping survival that won't break the bank. This is the knife for you.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried several keyboards on my Galaxy S with Android 2.2, and found that SwiftKey is the best. I, too, bought it a few days ago when the beta trial was about to end. It's well worth its price, but free is even better! SwiftKey is sometimes almost clairvoyant in its predictions, especially after you've used it for a while. I also appreciate the availability of numbers and some symbols by long-pressing on the main keyboard. I recommend it highly.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used swift key for about a year now and love it. However, you will need to remember that there is a learning curve. You will have to get used to using the predictions at the top. It actually starts to get how you write. I usually only type the first two or three letters in my contact's names and it predicts the rest. Give it a solid month of use before you make an opinion about it. One problem that I found is that I have a hard time using a regular keyboard now. I keep looking for the predictions on the monitor... Btw, I rarely type text messages now... I just use the SwiftKey mic and speak the messages. Not perfect but another great feature.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Don't get me wrong, wht she went through was hell. And I wasn't after detailed descriptions of her abuse, however, it felt like it was being written by an 11 year old, and I know that is some respects it was. Cats and pages of journals. I realise the significance of the cats to her, and how important that was to her existance but as a book it just wasn't flowing. It really needed something else, I am not sure what but what was 18 years in captivity is not covered well in the book.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I've used the old version of Swiftkey as well as the X beta, before trying this one today. Predictive typing is a good idea and can work reasonably well. But I go back to other keyboards (i.e., Swype) because of two issues:<br /><br />1. I haven't been able to add words to the dictionary. There are words that I type regularly that I have to completely spell out every time because Swiftkey refuses to learn/recognize them.<br /><br />2. I write in English and Spanish. Swiftkey's \\"automatic detection\\" doesn't work nearly as well as a dedicated option would.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I bought the original SwiftKey on the Amazon Appstore several months ago and fell in love with it. It is a great virtual keyboard, which is why I am giving SwiftKey X the five stars that it deserves and I would fully recommend anyone who has not tried it to give it a shot. So, when I heard that a new and improved version, SwiftKey X, was in the works, I was really excited. Unfortunately, today, when I went to buy the app, I was confronted with the fact that my handset, the Sprint HTC Hero, had been deprecated from compatibility on the Amazon Appstore for it.    Yes, my handset is getting rather long in the tooth, but I know for a fact that this keyboard works just fine with SwiftKey X. I installed the beta and had no issues with it and it worked flawlessly for several of my other friends who are rocking a Sprint HTC Hero as well. So, Amazon, what gives? I have noticed that SEVERAL apps, not just SwiftKey X, on my list that I have downloaded in the past are now deprecated in terms of compatibility with my handset. All of these apps would work fine on it too. Why are you removing the potential for certain handsets to receive the benefits of various apps when they can still run them?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Bottom-Line: Get it, read it (iPad preferably), and prepare to be blown away!<br /><br />\\"When playing A Game of Thrones, your either win or die,\\" Queen Cersi said to Lord Eddard Stark.  So sets the tone for the lush for novel A Game of Thrones, book (1) from the now epic series A Song of Ice and Fire by American author George R.R. Martin.  Not since the Lord of the Ring trilogy have I been this deeply immersed in a book, so invested in in every chapter, ever word, every character.<br /><br />The Fantasy genre has long been my favorite type of books to read.  Within the folds of a superbly written tome one can leave this world, draped as it is in increasing misery, and journey to a time and place wherein anything is possible; magic, dragons, dwarfs, zombies, direwolves, giants, and all manner of being from our wildest imagines come to life within the page of \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"<br /><br />George R.R. Martin weaving with a rich tapestry of words creates a world unlike any other where in a giant wall of ice hundreds of mile long and half as think protect men from the unspeakably evil things the live beyond it.  Here in the Seven Kingdoms, things have been as they are for thousands of years with little change; winter and summer are measured in decades not months and dragons used to hold sway, long gone, but not forgotten.<br /><br />Checking in at some 880 pages, A Game of Thrones, first published in August 1996,  sweeps across a violent and noble world of Westeros held together by the allegiance of seven families to one King who sits the Iron Throne in Kings Landing; however his rule is marked by blood, backstabbing, betrayal, and all manner of human debauchery.  Across the sea is another land ruled by a fierce nomadic people whose barbarism will shock the conscience mind, yet there a nobility and strength to be admired...<br /><br />I could not begin to summarize the plot of A Game of Thrones within the space of this review, so rich and expansive is it.  The prologue of the book opens in the North beyond the wall and sets the tone for the rest of the chapters which are named after the main characters of the book; e.g. Eddard (Eddard Stark of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North), Catelyn (Lady Catelyn Stark, wife of Eddard), Tyrion (Tyrion Lannister, son of Tywin Lannister the Lord of Casterly Rock & Warden of the West), etc.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones has all of making of a great drama, sex, murder, incest, politics, debauchery, love, innocence, intrigue, excellent character development, extraordinary writing, and a totally engaging story that spans (4) books.  How could I not recommend you sit down and submerge yourself in such art?<br /><br />Other Books in the Series:<br /><br />A Clash of Kings<br />A Storm of Swords<br />A Feast of Crows<br />A Dance With Dragonsond the wall and sets the tone for the rest of the chapters which are named after the main characters of the book; e.g. Eddard (Eddard Stark of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North), Catelyn (Lady Catelyn Stark, wife of Eddard), Tyrion (Tyrion Lannister, son of Tywin Lannister the Lord of Casterly Rock & Warden of the West), etc.      A Game of Thrones has all of making of a great drama, sex, murder, incest, politics, debauchery, love, innocence, intrigue, excellent character development, extraordinary writing, and a totally engaging story that spans (4) books.

0545259088|3.0|The book was great up until the ending. For this book to be the final one I guess I expected some closure for Grace and Sam but it didn't happen. The books ending was left open to the point another book could be written but it won't be so why do that?<br />Also we know that only one of the eight wolves were named that were killed. The book should have said something about the pack that lived with Beck and Sam. Disappointed ending to such a beautiful series. The book itself is lovely even without the cover page and the writing done in red is awesome. Just the white and red of the book is awesome. I wanted to be happy or sad but not left feeling like WHY!
1594202710|5.0|On China is more than one book. It is a complete and interesting overview of Chinese history and it dwells also in the complicated and bumpy relationship between modern China and the United States. Kissinger´s analysis of the dynamics of the Cold War in On China could have been too a book in itself, as also the author´s personal memories and thoughts of the times he lived, in and out of politics. Henry Kissinger was the first American to engage modern China in negotiations after the victory of Mao in 1949 and the establishment of the Popular Republic of China.And he has remained for decades the link-formal or not- between the United States and China. As an insider, he describes as no one could do, not only the leaders that conform the secretive inner circle of power in China, their strategies and thinking, but the obstacles that both countries have faced on the way to establish a close and workable relation. Some of the issues, as the relation with Taiwan,remain unsolved, but as Kissinger explains through the book the main problem is the cultural abyss that separates China and the United States. On China was written as part of the solution: it is meant to be a bridge between China and the US.To help the reader understand- and If possible empathize-with China. From this point of view, this excellent book is the last act in the life of a brilliant diplomat and scholar.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|(It should be noted that I am not Jean - I am merely her daughter, a girl completely obsessed with all works by the Bronte sisters, Jane Austen, and the like.)    I have been a great fan of Jane Eyre for quite a while, but I have only recently begun watching movie adaptations. I viewed the most recent Jane Eyre in March and quite enjoyed it, but now find it lacking slightly because of the detail included in this adaptation.    I found this one to be very concise and enjoyed the way they focused on the nuances of Rochester and Jane's relationship. Yes, they changed some dialogue and added some scenes, but I personally found it pardonable. Some viewers today may not understand the nuances and meanings of some of Charlotte Bronte's language, and while I mourn that more exact lines from the book were not included in this movie, I believe that it is still a very good adaptation.    However. A few scenes I was particularly displeased with included ones where Jane and Rochester were in Jane's bedroom. This not only did not occur in the book, but would have been considered scandalously improper during that time period and thus Jane would not have allowed it. Their behavior may not be considered licentious today, but I believe that it was rather unrealistic, considering the strict rules of propriety from that time period.    All in all, it is a very good adaptation, in my opinion, and deserves to be called such.

Istanbul  Index    ============================================    It's only fair that I should start this rambling in the same way as I started the book: from the last but one chapter.    For me, purely personally, by far the most interesting part of the book was chapter 21, because it is dedicated to the town in which I was born and raised. The chapter's a real riot to read, at few points the laughter becomes almost dangerously intense. As far as I can say, for I was about ten years old at the time, Mr Bryson has captured the atmosphere of the devastating crisis from the early 1990s very convincingly. His description of the town in the early 1970s, during the height of the Communist rule, is stupendously funny but, from all I've heard from my parents, very accurate and even perceptive as well:    \\"I remembered Sofia being a city of broad boulevards so empty of traffic that people walked down the middle of them, stepping aside only to make room for the occasional Zill limousine carrying party functionaries to some dark, Orwellian ministry. I have never been in a more timeless city. It could have been any time in the last forty of fifty years. There were simply no clues to suggest what decade it was; the shape of the few cars in the road, the clothes people wore, the looks of the shops and buildings were all curiously uniformed in fashion.\\"    \\"Sofia had an enormous department store called TSUM, [...] spread over five floors and containing not a single product that it looked as if it had been produced more recently than 1938.\\"    Though I am pleased with Mr Bryson's claim that Sofia without any doubt has the most beautiful women in Europe, I have to say that I have never been able to notice that myself.    Of course many things in Sofia have changed out of recognition since the early 1990s. For better or for worse is a debatable question, but I guess Mr Bryson would not even recognise the city today. That's why the final paragraph of his Chapter 21 is unusually perceptive:    \\"My guess is that communism in Bulgaria won't last. It can't last. No people will retain a government that can't feed them or let them provide toys for their children. I'm certain that if I come back to Sofia in five years it will be full of Pizza Huts and Laura Ashleys, and the streets will be clogged with BMWs, and all the people will be much happier. I can't blame them a bit, but I'm glad I saw it before it changed.\\"    I don't know whether my admiration for Mr Bryson's \\"Sofia chapter\\" is not due more to sentimental reasons than to any literary value or author's perspicacity, but one thing is sure: Sofia is a dead dull city in which there is hardly anything worth seeing. It's a vastly different matter to visit some of the greatest European capitals like Paris, Rome and Vienna. And here the real value of Mr Bryson's book surfaces all too obviously.    After reading A Short History of Nearly Everything, I have learnt not to expect much from Bill Bryson. And he delivers the same, if not worse, pulp non-fiction here: sometimes dull but often hilarious, with very occasional flash of insight but with a good many comments so pedestrian that one wonders how he had the audacity to publish them. Of course he is wonderfully readable and he often makes me laugh my head off - which are considerable virtues by far not every writer is endowed with - but what else is there to justify the existence of that book? Very little as it turned out.    The story is simple and effective enough, and it pretends to be all true. In 1972, the very young, enthusiastic and charming Bill Bryson wandered through Europe. Some two decades later the middle-aged, whining and exasperating Bill Bryson repeated the stunt and, inexplicably, decided to write a book about it. From time to time some travel companion of his appears too, and he is one of those enchanting personalities who feel compelled to use the word [Amazon censorship!] every second sentence. Bryson himself almost never stops complaining: about people, about hotels, about buses, about restaurants, about bars, about... you get the picture, don't you? His arrogance is of cosmic proportions and so is his vanity; he is cocksure about everything and seldom - if ever - does it occur to him that there might be other point of view but his own. Bill Bryson is the chap who knows, everything about anything everywhere in Europe, most often in a compulsively derisive tone. Rarely does he allow himself to show some appreciation, let alone affection, for the cities he visited or the people he met. But his pages are packed with trivia, most of it badly dated, and sweeping generalisations which are obviously based on a very limited experience and can be called ''perceptive'' only by abusing the word. Instead, Mr Bryson's devastating sarcasm pervades pretty much every paragraph. It is generally very amusing, if caustic, but it sometimes is crude, overdone, heavy going and just short of obscene as well.    So why on earth did Bill Bryson write that book at all? It is no travel guide, to be sure, for there is not enough specific information, but since such books age quickly, this is all for the better. Nor is Mr Bryson concerned with more than a very perfunctory glance at the European history, philosophy or art. To do him justice, I would suppose that he wrote that book with no other aim but to provide a solid dose of fun - otherwise the volume would hardly worth the paper it's printed on.    There is a lot of fun here all right. But there's a lot of arrogance, inanity, ignorance and even bigotry, too.    Let's start with the fun, shall we? It is not an especially intelligent amusement and a great deal of it might well be fictional, but it makes one laugh, or at least such episodes certainly make me laugh:    \\"...a waitress named Shirley who was the most unpleasant person I have ever met. Whatever you ordered, she would look as if you just asked to borrow her car to take her daughter to Tijuana for filthy weekend.\\"    \\"In the evening I went looking for a restaurant. This is often a problem in Germany. For one thing, there's a good chance that there will be three guys in lederhosen playing polka music, so you have to look carefully through the windows and question the proprietor closely to make sure that Willi and the Bavarian Boys won't bound onto a little stage at half past eight, because there is nothing worse than being just about to tuck into your dinner, a good book propped in front of you, only to find yourself surrounded by ruddy-faced Germans waving beer steins and singing the ''Horst Wessel Lied'' for all they're worth. It should have been written in the armistice treaty that the Germans would be required to lay down their accordions along with their arms.\\"    \\"The best thing that could be said about travelling abroad with Katz was that it spared the rest of America from having to spend the summer with him.\\"    \\"...I spied a coin under the seat in front of me, and with protracted difficulty leaned forward and snagged it. When I sat up, I saw my seatmate was at last looking at me with that ominous glow.  ''Have you found Jesus?'' he suddenly asked.  ''Uh, no, it's a quarter,'' I answered and quickly settled down and pretended for the next six hours to be asleep, ignoring his whispered entreaties to let Christ build a bunkhouse in my heart.\\"    That said, and quoted, a great deal of the book is actually too dull to be funny. Mr Bryson's endless curiosity about the commonplace and the mundane isto my mind devastatingly wearisome. I do not wish to put on any airs and sound like some lousy intellectual snob, for I am neither intellectual nor a snob, but I am often astonished at the impossible crap that Mr Bryson thought worthy of writing, not to mention publishing. Last but not least, Mr Bryson is also prone to awkward and rather self-indulgent digressions: in the middle of Belgium he thinks it necessary to reflect why cows are the perfect pets as far as he is concerned, and while walking through the streets of Cologne he feels compelled to lecture us about the invasion of Japanese electronics into the Western world. Thank you, Bill, your enthusiasm to inflict your opinions of cows and electronics is much appreciated, but I'd rather do without either.    Now let's have a look at the saddest part of all. We may start with Vienna. Sometimes Mr Bryson does tend to be appallingly crass, and the case of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum is a perfect example. After giving his stupefyingly superficial description - \\"fabulous - vast, grand, full of great paintings\\" - Mr Bryson explores in detail the \\"commendable\\" system with information cards for visitors in every hall, complains that the museum is much too big and finally gives some of the greatest junk I have ever read about anything:    \\"...I was suffering from museum fatigue. In these circumstances, especially when I have paid a fortune to get in and feel that there are still a couple of hours standing between me and my money's worth, I find myself involuntarily supplying captions to the pictures: ''Salome, on being presented the head of John the Baptist on a salver saying: \\"No, I ordered a double cheeseburger,\\" or an exasperated Saint Sebastian whining, \\"I'm warning you guys, the next person who shoots an arrow is going to be reported.\\"    Well, Bill, this is the perfect thing to say when, after twelve hard hours of strenuous tourism, you're sitting in a cozy bar sipping your fourth cocktail late in the evening. But it is definitely not something that deserves to be printed.    When he is in Paris, Mr Bryson is so desperate that the Louvre is crowded that he tells us amazing stories about how terrible the traffic in the French capital is and then goes on into considerable, and intolerable, detail how his travel companion had twice become a victim of bird [Amazon censorship!]. And do you know what was the only picture in the Louvre that Bill Bryson remembered from his last visit and very much wanted to see again? One that showed two ladies, one of whom had casually put a finger into the other's \\"fundament\\"!    Give me a break, Bill, will you!    Now, I am all for flippancy on every page and tongue-in-cheek narrative all the time, but inanity and vulgarity I cannot possibly tolerate, especially from a man who spends several days in each of Europe's grandest capitals and is supposed to be fairly intelligent. Nobody expects Mr Bryson to be a witty kind of Baedecker, much less a walking history of art, but some sensitivity to and seriousness about matters other than sleeping, eating, drinking and [Amazon censorship!] would be much appreciated. Moreover, in addition to being a sex maniac and a philistine, Bill Bryson is an awful prig as well:    \\"I don't think I can altogether forgive the Germans their past, not as long as I can wonder if that friendly old waiter who brings me my coffee might once have spent his youth bayoneting babies or herding Jews into gas ovens. Some things are so monstrous as to be unpardonable. But I don't see how anyone could go to Germany now and believe for a moment that that could ever happen again. The Germans are becoming the new Americans - rich, ambitious, hardworking, health-conscious, sure of their place in the world.\\"    The last two sentences are typical for most of Mr Bryson's positive comments: ambiguous and condescending, reeked of insincerity, added as if only to preserve some sense of decorum. One wonders if Mr Bryson could ever forgivethe Spaniards the Inquisition, Rome the Crusades, the French people the French Revolution or his fellow Americans the Indian wars.    Not only is Mr Bryson a prig, but he is also a prude, as shown on the main train station in Cologne:    \\"And then I saw something that gave me an instant urge to get out of there. It was a non stop porno movie house, and quite gross one at that, to judge from the candid glossy pictures on display by the ticket booth. The movie house was in the station, one of the services permitted to travelers by the thoughtful management of Deutsche Bundesbahn, the national railway company. I don't know precisely why, but I found this hugely repellent. I have no special objection to pornography, but in a train station? There was just something so seedy about the idea of a businessman stopping off at the end of the day to watch twenty minutes of bonking before catching the 5:40 to his home and family in Bensberg, and there was something seedier still in the thought of a national railway endorsing it.\\"    This from a man who fantasises about stewardess and couchettes during a long bus travel, falls in love (read \\"lust\\") with innocent receptionists, is convinced that some dogs want to have sex with him and walks through the Red Lights district of Amsterdam giving us detailed descriptions of sex shop windows and covers of pornographic magazines. Had Mr Bryson had a little common sense more, he might have reflected that the \\"repellent\\" practice of Deutsche Bahn actually shows a very keen understanding of human nature. Needless to say, it never even occurs to Mr Bryson that the \\"seedy\\" story with the businessman might well be a product of his own sick imagination. I have to say that I am sorry for having missed that porn cinema last time when I was passing through Cologne. It might have been removed since those loose times when Mr Bryson wandered through Europe.    It is true that sometimes Mr Bryson manages to convey a very genuine imitation of enthusiasm, which is almost touching actually, but that happens all too rarely in the maelstrom of inspired nonsense. One such exception from the usual crappy stuff is the awe Mr Bryson obviously felt as he entered St Peter in Rome:    \\"St. Peter doesn't look all that fabulous from the outside, at least not from the piazza on its foot, but step inside and it is so sensational that your mouth falls open. St. Peter is a marvel, so vast and beautiful and cool and filled with treasures and airy heights and pale beams of heavenly light that you don't know where to place your gaze. It is the only building I have ever entered where I have actually felt like sinking to my knees, clasping my hands heavenward, and crying: ''Take me home, Lord.'' No structure on earth would ever look the same to me again.\\"    I wish there had been more passages like this one. But there aren't. What is more, they are used as lame excuses for Mr Bryson's indolence, or lack of interest perhaps, or I don't know what. Certainly his dismissal of the Sistine Chapel and the museums of Vatican is downright mind-boggling:    \\"...then went to the Sistine Chapel and the museums, and they were naturally impressive, but I confess that all the other visual experiences were largely wasted on me after the spacious grandeur of St. Peter's.\\"    \\"Impressive\\"? Is that all your brain can produce, Bill? Obviously. All that Mr Bryson has to say about the famous \\"Pieta\\" of Michelangelo, surely one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of European art, is that he ''had a look'' at it and it was behind a barrier and a glass screen which kept visitors too far away. I rest my case.    In short, highly enjoyable but perfectly forgettable read. One laughs a great deal while reading it, but after the last page there is a feeling of curious intellectual blankness. I cannot honestly give one star to a book which is so readable and makes me laugh so much, especially one that has obviously been designed for nothing more. But I cannot honestly give it more than two stars either, for great part of it is occupied by the egotism, vulgarity and stupidity of the author. The man has the inestimable gift of great readability, moronic stuff and all. He is not entirely devoid of brains or a sense of humour either. Sadly, the former is all too seldom used, and the latter is severely marred by his triviality and his vulgarity. All that reduces his book to a guilty pleasure, fleeting and useless. I surmise one is unwise to expect more from Bill Bryson.

En cuanto a la película la considero emotiva por el hecho del retroceso en el tiempo y la oportunidad de volver a vivir las experiencias de la adolescencia, quien no quisiera pasar por algo así y poder corregir algunas cosas que no se hicieron bien en el camino?  Esta película es también entretenida, me encanta la secuencia en la que cantan Nicolas Cage y Jim Carrey con los otros muchachos y es gracioso y agradable verlos tan jóvenes.

0553801473|3.0|You could really divide this book into two parts, the big 3 (Jon, Tyrion, and Dany) and everyone else.<br /><br />Martin took a lot of flak when he released A Feast for Crows and he left out arguably the 3 most popular characters left in the series. I felt like he tried to make up for that and really wrote way too much for each of them. There is so much fat to be trimmed in each of their stories, Dany's in particular, that he could have saved himself a lot of time and grief just by tightening up those stories.<br /><br />Where this book shines is in the smaller characters (not named Quentyn Martell) The Bran, Reek, Asha Greyjoy, Victorian Greyjoy, and Ser Barriston Selmy chapters are all fantastic. The Reek chapters are some of the darkest material GRRM has written in the series.<br /><br />Several cliffhangers from AFfC are all resolved.<br /><br />One thing I would recommend doing id if you can get your hands on the Dunk and Egg stories, I would read those before this as there are a few things that won't allow you to have the full experience.<br /><br />Hopefully the pressure to not let the HBO show catch up to him gets Martin to finish the series up quickly.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|First, I want to warn you that there are spoilers. Second,  want to tell you the good things. And then the bad (Which seem to exceed the good.)    The Good things, ...I liked the fact that Katniss has still got her own little spark...in the beginning.  Off the top of my head that's about all I can think of.    And now the bad, that spark gets snuffed out about 25% through the book. Second, i seems as of the main intent is to kill most of the characters, have the others become mentally disabled, or have them desert Katniss. Katniss herself is mentally disabled. Alot of the time is spent in the hospital, with Katniss menally unstable. And by the end of the book she's the same way, finding no comfort im a husband and children. I thought this to be a stupid ending. I loved the other 2 books, but Collins didn't live up to expectations. Very unexpected, such as (spoiler!) she shoots President Coin. Sometimes this confused me, for instance, (spoiler) when Prim died, and Katniss thought she was dead, I was extremely confused. This book had many flaws, and  I would only recommend it to find out what happens to Katniss. Also, as a final thought, their is alot of dumb and pointless violence and fighting.    Bye, Mockingjay, for good. Because, Collins let us down.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Do I even need to say how long it's been? A Feast for Crows was a placeholder, a holding action intended to keep the story going just a little during the decade-long creative struggle George R.R. Martin faced at the end of A Storm of Swords. It would be easy enough to set aside any objective criticism and instantly adore the book. But that's not how I am as a reader, and as grateful as I am for A Dance with Dragons, it's not as satisfying as A Storm of Swords, A Game of Thrones, or A Clash of Kings. This is not to say that it's a bad book -- anything but. It is at turns thrilling and terrifying -- a big complicated behemoth of a book full of unexpected surprises and deftly paid-off moments of plot. But there is trouble at the heart of it -- the fabled \\"Meereenese Knot\\" that Martin grappled with for so long.<br /><br />Before I continue, I want to note that I am going to avoid spoilers and speak in generalities. I understand that those generalities may be considered spoilers -- so read on at your own peril. But please be aware that I will not spoil specific plot twists, character reveals, etc.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons is centered around three major story-lines -- Dany's rule in Meereen, as well as the many people trying to reach her; Jon's tenure as Lord Commander of the Knight's Watch on the Wall; and the north under the stewardship of the Boltons. Other characters and settings are addressed, including a few lingering threads spun out of A Feast for Crows, but Dany and Jon are by far the most critical characters in the book.<br /><br />The problem is that the \\"Meereenese Knot\\" isn't so much a knot, as it is a cul-de-sac. For five books now we've watched Dany develop as a queen, waiting for her to arrive on the shores of Westeros with her dragons and her army. And yet at the close of A Storm of Swords, Dany decided to stay in newly-conquered Meereen on the shores of Slaver's Bay to learn how to rule. Her arc is concerned mostly with that -- as well as the unexpected consequences of her decisions. The early chapters in the arc are some of the least interesting in the entire book, but Dany's arc begins to pick up steam in the last third of A Dance with Dragons, driven in large part by a compelling new POV character. Yet, as the book closes, I'm not sure that I'd say the knot is any looser than where it began. Only Martin knows for sure, but with so much time devoted to Dany, I'm not sure very much progress has been made.<br /><br />Jon's arc on the Wall also deals with the complications of rule -- the compromises leaders must make for the greater good. And as Jon makes some very difficult decisions, it's easy to wonder if he has some of his Ned Stark's weaknesses, or if he will rise above his father's mistakes. One could also say that Jon's arc has certain ... Shakespearean overtones.<br /><br />The Boltons are, I believe, the only true \\"villains\\" in the series -- characters so vile and evil that they are irredeemable. Yet, they are believable villains -- a family of sociopaths who pass on their predatory approach from father to son. Their story is told from a surprising POV character who I would rather not name, and I found the Bolton chapters to be especially compelling, as well as disturbing.<br /><br />The remaining characters and arcs in the story are probably best left unmentioned -- although they often eclipse the three major plot movements of the book and lay important pieces for books to come. I will say that I have gone from being lukewarm about Victarion Greyjoy to wanting to hop aboard a longship and follow him across the world -- the guy is an incomparable badass, reckless and bold, a true pirate lord. My old favorite Davos Seaworth is on hand for a few chapters and remains one of the most humble and truly brave and heroic characters in A Song of Ice and Fire. But my favorite POV chapters come from a completely new character -- one who shepherds in a whole series of changes into the series.<br /><br />AlthoughA Dance with Dragons is a much more engaging book than A Feast for Crows, I believe many readers will find that it shares many of the unsatisfying elements that plagued its immediate predecessor. Playing pieces are shuffled into position (or out of position), but very little is resolved. This is not surprising for a series as big and ambitious as A Song of Ice and Fire, but with such a long gap between books, it can be disappointing. Unlike earlier volumes in the series, A Dance with Dragons does not tell a complete story -- it is more complete than A Feast for Crows, but only just so.<br /><br />Here's hoping for a shorter wait before the release of Winds of Winter.A Dance with Dragons is a much more engaging book than A Feast for Crows, I believe many readers will find that it shares many of the unsatisfying elements that plagued its immediate predecessor.

B002IVLH60|3.0|I grew up on Pearl Jam, let me get that out of the way. Ten and Vs. were my high school love affairs. But when Vitalogy was a let down followed by the highly unimpressive No Code and then Yield (which SEEMED to get them back on track, but fell short after more than a few listens), the love affair was sadly over. I don't don't know what happened between Vs. and Vitalogy, but there was seemingly no passion behind anything other than their ballads. Which I think works for Vedder's beautiful strained chaotic vocals. However, the faster songs are just an uninspired train wreck with Vedder seemingly struggling to match the pace of the rest of the band. I think they should come to terms with this and slow down so we can hear Eddie Vedder's talent again. Some people may not like his solo effort Ukelele Songs, but that's the best he has sounded since the 90s.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Its been a long times since I've read a young adult book, 15 years maybe. Wow have they changed! I will not be letting my 12 year old read this book. I will teach her about some of the harsh realities of llife in a much different way. How will this movie ever be PG13 while staying true to the book?    It didn't seem particularly well written. Parts were too slow yet parts needed to slow down and be more detailed. The characters were one dementional and fell flat. Who was I supposed to like and cheer for?  I think I only liked Finnick and Prim. But you were supposed to like Prim. She was without flaw, which is again one dementional.    Yes it didn't end the way I would have liked. But that doesn't have to ruin the whole book if the rest of it is well written. I feel ripped off. If I had known this was how the last book was, I would have spent the time and money on better books.  I don't suppose Amazon will give me my money back.... I'm actually so disappointed, I will not be going to see the movies. It will surely be too gory for my taste. Plus I just don't like this story.    Again, I don't think this book is very young people oriented. I'd recommend waiting till your kids are old enough they won't have nightmares from it. Its got some quite violent gory parts. I'll be teaching my daughter about how horrible war is in a very different way, thank you very much!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using this for a few months and it is great.  It's got geeat features and the prediction is impressive.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I had originally ordered this set in April, 2011 only to cancel the order after thinking about it.  I love Star Wars, but they are highly marketed.  They will release this version and multiple others.  They sucker you into buying new version after new version to get the options that you would have liked with the first release.  This blu-ray boxed set should include both the new and original versions of the movies.  We all know that will be released at a later date, also (probably after many releases of \\"special editions\\").  I choose to wait until they release the version I want and know will eventually come.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this show.   Lots of great characters.  Some you love, some you hate.    It is more then a motorcycle gang show, it is about relationships, revenge, and dynamic plots.   Give Season 1 a shot!  You will not be disappointed!
B001R4CKGU|1.0|This was just wretched unless you enjoy reading books without plot and then overanalyzing it for kicks. If you're in the latter camp, knock yourself out, but please don't give yourself a prize by proxy for it.
B003UESJH4|4.0|What's to say.  This is an excellent, if not important film.  Very likable.  reminds me of the year Rocky beat Network for the Oscar like this did the Social Network.  Hard times = feel good films.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I'm an organization freak and I have been waiting for an app like this. I hate clutter on my screens and the ability to group apps into folders is the perfect solution!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I got in on the beta for swift key and have been very happy with it from the beginning. The predictive text is great and learns from what I normally type. I was happy to pay $0.99 and for free it's a no brainer.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|This keyboard is not even close to the Flex T9 keyboard. If you type with two thumbs (not sure who still does that though) then this keyboard is for you. If you want to type efficiently and, more importantly quickly, skip this and go for Flex T9 (or even Swype). I was mislead into thinking that this keyboard had a swyping functionality, which it does not, from what I can tell. After getting used to not lifting my finger between letters, that method of typing is fast superior.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|The story in the book was more complex, thus more interesting. Still, I enjoyed the movie, and especially thought Matthew McC. was a perfect choice for Mickey Haller. If you liked this at all, I highly recommend that you read any of Michael Connelly's books (he's the author of the book that this movie is based on). He's a former journalist who covered crime, so he writes better than most crime novelist. Plus, his books are intelligent and his plots are good.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|The worst thing about this app is that you lose your dictionary when it updates. I'm sooooooo pissed at this apparent right now. It also will autofill a word even after you've backed up multiple times. It often does not want you to use short words apparently. I got this free,  but I'd NEVER pay for it.... like typing all caps.... lock the caps and it STILL will change the case...all keyboards are crap though!
B00006G8HX|4.0|Star Trek III starts off strong, but tapers off. I like the ambience in the beginning of the film, including its exploration of the Star Trek universe's underworld at the bar and the mercenaries' meeting with the Klingons. Also, the scene in which the crew steals the Enterprise is a classic. The space battle is a good one and the resolution classic Kirk. Yet, halfway through, the film seems to lag. It's quite obvious Spock will be resurrected, but it takes a while. The fight between Kirk and the Klingon is just boring and oddly lacks a memorable soundtrack. The film's denouement on Vulcan takes way too long, almost as long as that of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, but without the emotional drama. However, the film's underlying problem is that the title gives it all away - namely, the audience knows Spock will be revived. There no suspense in that part. Overall, it defies the old rule that the odd-numbered Star Trek movies are all bad, but it's also not as good as the even-numbered ones.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I have seen this movie a dozen times and hope to watch it a dozen more. It makes me laugh and cry every time. Gooooood movie.
0553801473|2.0|I have much enjoyed the first three books in this series. They chronicle a huge story of a world much like ours in it's medieval period. They accurately portray it's social and political issues. None of the characters in this story are heroes, even the most likeable of them have a dark side, and this only makes them more like real people. It seems that by the end of the fourth book, \\"Feast for Crows\\", so much of the world of Westeros, its people, its strange creatures, and all which has been done to make it tick has been revealed. Now there seems nothing left for the next three books but more about the Westerosi menu, Myrish lace, mad priestess rantings, and needless repetitions of all these, while secondary characters revisit old predicaments for filler. The tale has run out of pizazz, and George R. R. Martin's writing style is its own sort of torture device.<br /><br />GRRM should never have committed to such a long series. Three is a magic number, and three is where the third book \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is where the best of the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" was told - therefore, three is where the story should have been wrapped up. Maybe four, for the sake of exploring all the creatures beyond The Wall, but \\"Dance\\" makes it clear that seven, 500p+ volumes is pointless. Aye, the characters are life-like, reflecting our own world where the good people don't always win, and wars are long and bloody. Then again, it's a story of dragons and magic in a make-believe world! Enough already! Stephen King was long established before he took the \\"Dark Tower\\" dare, and it nearly destroyed him, so just who does GRRM think he is?<br /><br />Did I emphasize the sheer volume of GRRM's detail-bombing? He does the same with his characters' mental thrashings. Perhaps he just wants to be Stephen King. SK's signature is his ability to bring the reader into the minds of his characters, but he also creates interestingly flawed, sympathetic, and intelligent characters. GRRM has served up volumes on the mind of unbelievably naive Sansa Stark, and of other characters who don't deserve dwelling on. Dany's story used to be appealing, but not any more because of this issue.<br /><br />After plodding through \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", I will hardly hold my breath for another six years until Book 6 is released. GRRM has little of interest to add to the story, and is in dire need of a few good editors. As he has shown no inclination to relinquish control to anyone else, I would not expect improvement in the future.
0375842209|1.0|This is a terrible, terrible book. Just really, really awful.    The one thing you have to give Mr. Zusak credit for is divining perfectly the recipe for a bestseller. As far as I can tell, it goes something like this. 1) Pick the biggest, most gut-wrenchingly painful shared tragedy in recent Western history: Nazi Germany. Never mind that World War II fiction has been done to death. 2) Pick the most instantly pitiable character in literary history for your protagonist, in the vein of Cinderella or Oliver Twist or Annie: an orphan. 3) Insert details that any reader will identify with: obsessions with reading, trying to fit in, adolescent struggles. 4) Fill in every cliche you can think of: mean stepmother, hidden Jew in the Holocaust, \\"complicated\\" friendship/romance with boy next door. 5) Mask the lack of content with stupidly forced, faux-pretentious language throughout, and end every single chapter with a choppy series of simple sentences meant to inject drama into a book that drags on faaaaar toooooo looooong. This gives the reader the impression that they're reading something they should love, even though it's anything but.    From its overwrought beginning to its sloppily tragic ending, this book trots out just about every hackneyed trick imaginable. Please, read something else.

0143037757|5.0|Before his untimely death from ALS about a year ago, Judt was unfamiliar to me; it was only after reading an adoring obituary in The Guardian that I decided to investigate his work.  How right I was to do so.<br /><br />There are many historians who possess an imposing intellect and a dogged capacity for thorough research.  There are few who combine these qualities, as Judt does, with first-rate storytelling abilities and masterful command of language.  If you are put off by this book's massive length and the near-obsessive attention to detail that implies, the first thing you should be told is that it is a pleasure to read.  In Judt's hands, history has extraordinary immediacy.  Rather than take a bird's eye view, Judt places us in the position of someone living through these events as they take place.  His accounts of the many crises that occurred during this period (the Suez crisis, the Hungarian revolution, May 1968) are highly suspenseful, even though we already know the outcome in every instance.  The other refreshing thing about \\"Postwar\\" is that Judt eschews personal detachment.  He doesn't bother to conceal his distaste for politicians and movements he dislikes (e.g., Tony Blair), and his own in opinion on any subject he raises is usually apparent.  That said, he's never unfair or one-sided.  (While it's clear, for example, that he admires the Nordic welfare state, he doesn't overlook some of the darker policies Nordic governments adopted during the 50s and 60s).<br /><br />Not that Judt's thorough research isn't a pleasure on its own.  For me, the most illuminating chapters were the first, in which Judt reminds us of the sheer scale of the devastation wrought by WWII (which we Americans, brought up to view that war as \\"good\\", are sometimes apt to forget); the sixth, which deals with the Soviet-instigated purges and coups in eastern Europe, is a harrowingly thorough investigation of brutality and madness; and the eighth, in which Judt shows that sympathy for Communism among Western intellectuals was not just a right-wing talking point.  Judt ends the book with a powerful argument for the European welfare state and a masterful epilogue on the history of Holocaust remembrance.<br /><br />Anyone interested in this topic could do much worse than to start here.  We definitely lost a great one.g Western intellectuals was not just a right-wing talking point.  Judt ends the book with a powerful argument for the European welfare state and a masterful epilogue on the history of Holocaust remembrance.

1451629184|5.0|Bought the Kindle version of the book and read it in one day.  Like other reviewers, I felt it was easy to finish the book as I could not stop reading Jaycee's account of what happened \\"in her own words\\".  I was left awe inspired and completely fortunate that Jaycee would have the strength and courage to share her brutal story --- but more importantly, she leaves the reader with a sense that she is not going to allow herself to be a perpetual victim and actually uplifted me with how she is able to end the book on a positive note.      I think and write so much like Jaycee does and she brought me back to that place when I was an 11 year old girl as I read her journals signed with heart drawings --- this is what really brought me to tears and served as a painful reminder of the girl who was stolen.  How broken hearted her mom must have been as she read Jaycee's journals later. How Jaycee managed to pull herself through all of this just goes to show her natural instincts for survival. How Jaycee's mom pulled through --- never giving up hope --- is a miracle and testament to strength and will power in itself.  How Jaycee's daughters are managing to adjust and eager to go into the world is a testament to Jaycee's love and nurturing.  Jaycee's recovery is so fascinating to hear about as it's not very often I read about \\"what to do next\\" from a victim of a brutal crime.  This book will no doubt provide a road map for those in recovery and anyone in general experiencing difficult times.      Jaycee--you humble me.  I am honored and touched by you and your ongoing empathy for others including animals.  It's your sense of giving and forgiving that I feel are helping you to recover alot more quickly than is expected.  I am so glad for your new life.  Savor the good times and the present moment.  You certainly have reminded me to do so.
159668139X|5.0|I purchased an Ashford 32\\" table loom and this book as well as \\"Hands on rigid Heddle Weaving\\" by Betty Linn Davenport.  This book \\"Learning to Weave\\" by Deborah Chandler does have a lot of the basics in it, but it jumps quite quickly into the more advanced patterns and such.  Additionally all the photos appear to be in reference to a Multi-heddle floor loom rather than a simpler beginners loom.  Ms. Davenport's book will get me started and practiced and then hopefully Ms. Chandler's will give me the resources to understand how to take my weaving to the next level.  All in all, a great book and one worth having if you're planning to get serious about weaving.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|first off i only found the book mildly entertaining compared to some of the others. story was really slow and there was lack of excitement. my biggest grievance between the kindle version and paper version is that on the kindle you can not read the maps. i really enjoy looking at the maps and tracing characters journeys and i cannot in anyway read anything on the maps. this is a big disappointment.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard really does know what I'm thinking.  So cool that I type one word and it knows what word I'm about to type next.  It would be better if it had Swype technology but I find it's actually faster because I just tap on each word as they come up and don't have to type out many words at all.    Definitely give it a try.  You can link it to text messages, facebook, twitter, and gmail if you want to.  Great hands on video here: [...]
B0050CQY1W|5.0|this album was absolutely great! the only song i wasn't really feeling was \\"Party\\"...idk how that song appeared on the album after all the songs she recorded but watever, the album was great, i enjoyed every song and a few songs are on straight up repeat for me especially \\"Start Over\\", \\"Countdown\\", \\"Run the World\\", \\"End Of Time\\", \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" and \\"I Care\\". those are my absolute favorites from the album!!!!! beyonce's voice is still beautiful and powerful to listen to and this album is just amazing!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I have to join sides with those who are loyal to Swype.. i can't go back to just tapping, and though I do prefer to tap if I'm typing something longer, and like this review or a post on a message board.. for those instances, i like this keyboard's prediction better, but I think I will stick with Swype as my main keyboard...  for those of you who had trouble downloading the language pack.... did you consider that maybe a lot of people were trying to do the same thing, so maybe the server was overloaded? don't blame the app for your impatience.

WTF. anyway, this movie was great! screw anyone else who hated! they CLEARLY don't know TRUE comedy!!!! trust me folks, you're gonna LOVE this movie!

0553801473|1.0|If you thought GRRM would redeem himself for the  A Feast for Crows snooze-fest, well, you were wrong. Rather than bringing the old GRRM to the game, he continued his decline in A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />Taking the characters that were not in AFfC and a few new ones, he puts them to the same wandering that bored you before. Please feel free to:<br /><br />a.) not buy this book because it contributes almost nothing to the plot, or<br />b.) feel cheated by another GRRM rip-off.<br /><br />If you are addicted to uncomfortable sex scenes, diarrhea and/or menus . . . well, you won't be too disappointed.

0061784788|5.0|I ordered The Devil Colony because it sounded like a great conspiracy story.  I was not disappointed.  Americans are always finding out about cover-ups so who really knows the truth about anything?

Long, lush hair seems to be another job requirement.  Who cares - they're all brilliant and without them, the men wouldn't be as effective : - )<br /><br />I enjoyed the human element of how dementia affects everyone's family and the tenderness and frustration of one of the male agents.<br /><br />One scene could have been written by Stephen King, it was SO scary and creepy.<br /><br />Exploring Utah, Arizona and Iceland with feedback and information from Japan!

B004MKM8L8|2.0|I purchased this movie after seeing it in theatres and it is clearly a masterpiece of film making    However, in the Blu-Ray transfer there's an abboration in the anamorphic lens used to make the transfer that causes the image to be non-square and a light bar to appear running down the left side of the image, approximately 20% of the way into the image, that appears and disappears approximately every fifteen minutes.  On any sort of good viewing equipment this is noticable and highly distracting.    The audio, on the other hand, is a superb mix, possibly one of the best I've ever heard, with more detail than was available in the theatrical release thanks to the additional bandwidth available on a Blu-Ray disc compared to the DD/DTS/SDDS tracks on the film print.    Overall, although this is a great film, this review only receives two stars because for such a major release Warner Brothers should have double checked the digital transfer from film, and it's clear that they didn't.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was using the original Swiftkey for a while and noticed this was free today and couldn't resist.  This keyboard learns how you talk and predicts with extreme accuracy after a while.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this is amazingly good, but so good in fact that it makes my Xperia usable despite its normally crappy recognition. I can't stress his bad the x10's interface usually is... not sure sure it's just a sony thing or an android thing but this program has amazing correction abilities.. you don't even have to to try to get the letters even half right and it will fix it! you get to the choose either Fast or Predictive typing. you can have up to 3 languages at once and all 3 can be active at the same time, and no need to switch between them! this is so good it really should be standard for all android interfaces.

B004XISI4A|3.0|I am enjoying returning to the world of a Song of Ice and Fire after the long hiatus, and am kind of enjoying this as my first long e-book on the iPad (via Kindle). I haven't read too much yet, so this review is not concerned with the story itself.<br />The truly irritating aspect of this Kindle edition is the formatting. The most obvious problem involves paragraphs with dialogue. With annoying frequency (more often than not so far), a single paragraph will include dialogue from more than one character, instead of separating the speeches into paragraphs of their own. This easily leads to a misunderstanding as to who said what, and the realisation that a new character is speaking when you thought it was the character that started the paragraph is very grating and disruptive. It only takes a second to make the adjustment in your mind of course, but as it happens so frequently it detracts from the enjoyment of immersing oneself in the story.<br />In case that didn't make any sense, here is an example from the book:<br />\\"We are sworn to protect you,\\" Lemore said softly. \\"I don't need to be protected. I can use a sword as well as Duck. I'm half a knight.\\"<br />The section after 'softly' belongs to a different character, which is understood in context, but is still confusing, as obviously if Lemore continued speaking she would have her speech continue in the same paragraph.<br />Anyway, it's a fairly small problem but one which is really taking away from my enjoyment of reading the book and making me wish think twice about e-books in general (I'm assuming the paper version was formatted properly, though I haven't seen a copy).
B004WKOCP8|1.0|Seriously, when exactly did Incubus decide to utterly sell out and abandon everything that made them great in the first place and become a lite-rock radio cover band? Where is the originality, the FUNK, the SOUL, the UNIQUENESS that used to set them apart from the crowd?!<br /><br />I've never listened to an Incubus record going \\"gosh, that really sounds like a soft U2-meets-Coldplay\\" before now. They were always the band that set the bar for originality, and always had such a great, funky quirkiness about them that made them truly FUN to listen to. There's nothing \\"FUN\\" about this record, though. It's soporific, uninspired and completely soulless; UTTERLY gone are the huge, funky grooves & turntable counterpoint that made Incubus such a powerful, energetic and enigmatic perfect storm of creativity (and I'm sorry, but that SERIOUSLY weak nod to it on the last two tracks doesn't cut it for me!), and in their place is limp, narcolepsy-inducing, contrived, lifeless, trite and wholly unoriginal sellout-bubblegum-radio/21st century elevator music. No thanks.<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of this band since the very beginning, but if this is all they're going to be from this point forward, they can keep it and continue marketing to teenage girls and mindless sycophants exclusively, because that's seriously what you have to be to actually ENJOY this turd.<br /><br />It's been real, guys...

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee does a wonderful job of conveying what happened to her without the ugly details!  She is still here to talk about it because she did what she had to to survive.  Her sweet personality comes out in the storytelling.  This book is hard to put down.  It helps you understand the Stockholm syndrome and why she didn't leave when she had the opportunity.  In reading some of the reviews someone said that a good part of the book is writings from her journal.  Those writings help you realize that although this story is being told by Jaycee the adult, this was happening to Jaycee the child.  Jaycee, thank you for sharing your story with us.  I hope the media leaves you and your children to live out the rest of your lives in peace.  You definitely deserve it!

B0052KJ5UO|5.0|I have been a fan of 3DD since The Better Life album like most.  I have loved every release with Away from the Sun being my all time favorite.  Well 3DD has done it again.

I LOVE Race for the Sun and Time of My Life, and....oh who am I kidding, I love the entire album.  I'm sorry for those reviews that seemed disappointing, but I found NOTHING disappointing in this latest release by 3 Doors Down.  keep on rocking fellas!
0553805371|3.0|I'm not a scientist, and as some may ascertain from my other reviews, I am a theist, so I'm sure my review of Hawking's new book will be disregarded by some who read it. My current interest lies in trying to make sense of the disparity between the findings of modern science and the (often problematic) assertions of modern religion, and to that end, I make a diligent effort not to be dismissive of those who for whatever reasons don't hold my views (actually, some of my associates accuse me of giving theism's critics too much credit). It would certainly be irresponsible of me to dismiss the work of a scientist so accomplished and brilliant as Dr. Hawking simply because our worldviews disagree, and I greatly enjoy his writing, so although I 'knew the ending' going in, I read this book with great fervor.<br /><br />There are three ways to approach 'The Grand Design' in parallel: as a history primer on the subject of quantum physics and its relation to cosmology, as a snapshot on the state of the field, and as a predictive treatise on where it's headed. To those ends, the book works well. As others have pointed out, the history and the science are both pretty basic, but that should be expected- the book wasn't written for Dr. Hawking's colleagues and professional peers, but for laypeople and those with little formal understanding of a daunting and nuanced topic. The intended audience should walk away with a solid broad comprehension of how this area of science got where it is. Dr. Hawking does a marvelous job of summarizing the problems and challenges facing modern theorists in an accessible way, and the expectations and predictions he discusses follow easily from this summary. By the end, the reader should feel somewhat comfortable thinking about the subject of theoretical physics in the abstract.<br /><br />Why three stars? Well, a very basic review is by definition unspectacular, and more space COULD have been given to further flesh out some of the concepts and address some that were omitted for brevity's sake. I think Dr. H may have kept things intentionally brief so he more readers would see it through to the end of the book, but I find the explanations supporting his conclusions about the possibility of something arising from nothing to be very lacking. It's as though he develops each point of the argument very carefully (relatively so, given the book's shortness), then hits the reader with his conclusions quickly and with hardly any elaboration whatsoever.

It's as though he develops each point of the argument very carefully (relatively so, given the book's shortness), then hits the reader with his conclusions quickly and with hardly any elaboration whatsoever.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is, without a doubt and by far, the best android keyboard I have used. The text prediction is superior and intelligent. It is customizable to your style of typing: rapid typing with auto-correction or precise typing with predictions for speed. If you do not want it to access your personal communication in order to enhance and personalize the prediction, it is completely optional. If you rated it 1-star because it \\"steals personal info\\" please take off your tinfoil cap and rejoin society.    As the free app of the day, you can imagine the servers for language packs are quite busy and you may have to be patient (gasp) and use the default keyboard for a few more hours.    This keyboard deserves nothing less than the highest rating, especially considering if you downloaded it today 7/21, it cost you nothing.
0316098329|5.0|This is a great book! From the first line, this book grabbed me. The characters are \\"real\\". It took a while for me to understand what was happening, but I didn't want to stop reading for fear that I would miss the next exciting event. The love between the mother and son is felt in every sentence. If you like to read, this book will challenge you and tug at your heart. In light of recent events in American culture, the book speaks of what can be reality.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had a feeling Amazon would make this great app the free app of the day sooner than later.  I just paid full price on Monday for it, but I have no regrets.  I'm happy to support this developer because of the work they have put into this keyboard app.  I have tried several keyboard apps on my new EVO 3D, which comes with Swipe built in.  I don't really care for Swipe that much, but did enjoy using FlexT9 until I ran across the SwiftKey Beta.    I'm more of a one finger typer on these smaller keyboards and SwiftKey X works best for me.  As it has been mentioned, SwiftKey X learns your writing style and predicts what you are going to write.  Almost reads your mind!!    So if it's free, $2, or full price, this keyboard app is worth adding to your Android phone.

0553382179|3.0|I would really like this book on my Kindle, but why would I pay MORE for the Kindle version than the regular book?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have not been a big fan of reading sci-fi or fantasy books, but because there has been so much hype over this  trilogy I had to see what it was that made people rave about it, and I am glad I did! From the moment I met the main character young Katniss Everdeen, I was completely hooked and became so engrossed in reading the trilogy that I couldn't put the book down, I had to know what happened next. I love how the author weaves a powerful storyline that has so many parts: destruction. devastation, power, adventure, determination, love, friendship, etc ... and how she continues the storyline from book to book.<br />This trilogy will captivate and entertain you throughout each book, it will put you on a rollercoaster ride full of emotions from awe to fear to suspense to sorrow to cheering on Katniss, Peeta, Gale and the other memorable characters ... these books have it all and you won't be able to catch your breath until the finale! Thank you Ms. Collins, you have opened my eyes to the sci-fi and fantasy genre ... I am on my way to becoming a fan!

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Bought through Android Market and out of 4 keyboards I have used this takes first place. Letting the app go through Facebook, mail and texts has worked amazing for the word suggestions.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This hands down is the best keyboard on Android. The word prediction is nothing short of amazing. It will literally write the whole sentence you were about to write a in the predictions after a while. Once the app gets to know you personally you'll never go back to another keyboard.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I got this app when Amazon offered it for free, but I would have gladly paid for it. Before this, I was jealous of the folders on my daughter's iPod Touch. Not anymore! With folders of my favorite apps, I can get more on my home screen than ever before!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I can't believe this is free today. I bought from the market over a year ago at half price before they added the &quot;X&quot;. I started with beta testing then it went full version and became the first application I ever bought. I can type stuff completely off and this will still know what I meant to type.   I really can't say enough about how great this keyboard is. I'm almost upset that it's free today. I couldn't have waited a year though.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|It works fine and was easy but a little drawn out to set up. Not enough customization. Prediction is overkill with extra periods at ends of sentences and strange automatic words that pop up to start the next sentence, which I find to be wrong 99% of the time. Can't adjust or turn off vibration. Limited skin selection. Thought I would give this a try, but I'm uninstalling this and going back to Better Keyboard.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using this for some time and based on my other experiences with alternative keyboards, this is by far and away, the best android keyboard out there.  Consistently reduces 30+% of my keystrokes.

B001KVZ6F2|3.0|I imagine there are many war veterans in blue-collar America just as bigoted as Walt Kowalski.  But if Walt were played by a less well-known actor, the character's extreme one-dimensionality would probably have seemed more improbable than it does.  The picture is tolerable because I, like most movie-goers, am used to Clint's being Dirty Harry and making his points efficiently and with a minimum of subtlety.  Of course, the rest of the characters are equally cliched.  I will say that Clint's films seems more graceful at it than Charles Bronson's.  The climactic scene is a bit of a surprise, but I wonder what would have happened had the bad guys waited for Clint to fire the first shot.  I guess the message in all this is that we need to figure out how to accept the incursion of other cultures into our blue-collar neighborhoods.

0470932139|5.0|I opened the book to read it on Sunday and finished reading by Tuesday! Neither  because I know most of the book contents, nor the book has no contents except some gorgeous photos by the author! The book has almost 260 pages of useful information! But, because the book is written in such a beautiful style. As if someone is whispering in your ears. Also the information flow very smoothly and free of clutter of technical stuff although the book covers most of food photography aspects.<br /><br />At the beginning I ignored and skipped the parts that talk about exposure, Aperture and Shutter speed and went directly to the parts of interests. After reading one chapter of those, I went back to the beginning of the book and read it from first page to the last. Even I read the information I already know. I don't know why but I felt inspired.<br /><br />The author is a French came to USA in 90s and worked in several restaurant before she became the master chief of pastry  for a French restaurant.<br /><br />At the beginning she was photographing the pastry she make for the other colleague to make the same when she goes for vacation.

Then a talk about light and controlling the white balance. At the last, a talk about the camera modes.<br /><br />Third chapter is for the natural light and the characteristics of softness and hardness and how to control that using available tools. Then a talk about the direction of light and applying that in food photography.<br /><br />In the fourth chapter: here where the artificial lights enter into the picture. A talk about equipment used as lights Scrim panel and some setting for them. Then a talk about the popup flash and how to utilize it in food photography. Then a little talk about triggers followed by a talk about soft boxes and their uses.<br /><br />Fifth Chapter: Composition in food photography, this is where we start getting in to food photography business. A talk about where to put your subject - the hero - and centered subject in food photography. Then a little talk about  the famous Rule of Thirds! Followed by a talk about the focus and its importance to make your subject pop. Then the importance of depth of field and its importance as every subject requires an appropriate depth of field. At the last of this chapter a talk about a very importance subject which is perspective and camera angle.<br /><br />Chapter six is devoted for the preparation of the place and plate! The place you take photo at has to have some important features that make food photography a little easier safer and more fun. Also the plate has to be indicative of the food you are photographing all this along with making the scene and hero/props relation together with discussion about surfaces (backgrounds) and utilizing food height and color contrast are discussed in this chapter that ends with an important advise to shoot tethered . very important chapter and full of valuable information.<br /><br />Chapter seven: a talk about food types and styling them. It covers most of the food groups like herbs and spices, pastries and nuts, fruits and vegetables, soups, fish, meat, fries and pasta, burgers and sandwiches, breakfasts and pastries. Also suits like cakes, pies, ice creams and frozen suits. Cold and hot beverages. The chapter ends with a discussion about styling kit and tools used.<br /><br />Chapter eight - the last chapter ofthe book is for after photography related like downloading your photos from camera to your computer and the required equipment. then a discussion about copyrighting/watermarking your photos. Followed by discussion about post processing software available and the free ones of them. And finally sharing your photos in the web and printing.<br /><br />The book has  a section of appendixes that includes: A glossary, B equipment guide and C resources and where to get more information in this subject.<br /><br />For me, the book is 100/100 and deserves all pennies paid and each minute spent with it.<br /><br />The book is missing the part of post processing, but that is not so important to me.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I love it. Difficult to search through hundreds of pdf files because the reader doesn't organize the files  rationally. But if you access files on an SD card (where I keep mine) and where there is a file structure, you can find what you want quickly. On my 8 inch screen the files are very easy to read, they load quickly and it's easy to page through very large documents.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using the Beta and had every intention of buying this app at full price but now I get it for FREE!  The point is that this keyboard is worth getting even at full price.  The layout is very nice and attractive, the prediction/spell check is very intuitive and has the added bonus of having the option to learn your vocabulary by scanning your GMail, Twitter, etc accounts.  Very well implemented and highly recommended!
0553801473|3.0|The characters and the readers all plod plod plod.<br /><br />Plot paralysis is the name of the game.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, he wrote 3 great books in 5 years, followed by 2 mediocre ones in 11.<br /><br />I will definitely NOT be recommending this series to anyone.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Absolutely the best keyboard around. Now even better after Hebrew was added. Just awesome. &#1494;&#1492; &#1502;&#1502;&#1513; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1497;&#1503;! Keep it up. Just curious why the suggestions got bigger in the latest update.

0896898288|2.0|Reading a couple of the stories is fun, but reading them all is probably not going to happen in my case.<br />Nice stories.  Pretty quilt blocks.<br />No directions for the quilt blocks.<br />No measurements for the quilt blocks.<br />For the love of pete, ONE template on each PDF page... one would lose their mind printing them off, not to mention wasting a TON of paper.  106 templates, that's 106 pieces of paper, some for teensy tiny templates.  Good grief.<br />And so many of the block templates are just not needed.  Most quilters are able to quickly and efficiently cut a 4\\" square or make 15 HST's if they just know what size they should be.<br />I truly wish I had saved my money. There are so many quilt books out there with good directions.<br />I'm sure the author is a nice lady, but one must wonder how she came to think that the quilt patterns were complete.<br />I'm so disappointed, I was expecting so much more from this book.
B000BHN7D4|1.0|thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|I didn't care for the first part of the book.  It seemed to float from one action scene to another.  I remember groaning at one point, \\"Oh no, another pirate scene.\\"  It lacked coherence in my opinion.  As another reviewer said, it was episodic.  I'd have given this part of the book no more than 3 stars, maybe 2.    I liked the rest of the book a lot.  It became coherent and quite absorbing from the time it focused on Brianna and Roger, their relationship and their relationships with Claire and Jamie.  There was still plenty of action, but it seemed like a part of the whole story rather than an episode that was sandwiched into it.  In addition, there was quite a bit of historical fiction focusing on the various tribes of Indians in the area where Claire and Jamie settled which I found interesting.  I would have given this part of the book 5 stars if it had been a book of its own.  I debated whether to give the book as a whole 3 or 4 stars.  I chose the latter, because I felt the latter part of the novel was excellent.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm a big fan of free apps.  There's always a free app that can do what a paid app can do.  Having said that, I've only bought two apps in the year or so since I switched to using a smartphone...PdaNet (for bluetooth tether) and SwiftKey.  I absolutely have no regrets for having paid for SwiftKey and would do so again.  Luckily, for today at least, it is free.  Get it and be amazed!  It knows you better than your significant other.  It knows you better than your mom.  It knows you better than you know yourself...at least when it comes to what you are about to type next.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Okay, I admit it: I hate Indian movies. Have always hated them, except a few old movies like Sangam or their non-musical/stupid movies from 70s. But this movie was great. To be honest, I wanted to stop watching it 15 mins into the movie. I thought to myself hey I have enough personal troubles to be watching this sad movie but I soldiered on and stayed to see the rest and it did not disappoint. I loved it once I was done with it. Great movie, great story line and good acting. It's a modern love story of the sort you can not see in Hollywood. It's a story about humanity and good vs evil. Still, you could have faith in good nature human beings like Jamal and Latika. Even Salim redeemed his soul by taking on his boss. I am happy seeing this movie and will recommend it to every one I know... Great movie!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is my favorite keyboard for android and SwiftKeyX seems to have improved the experience .  Working great on my Epic 4g.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|I got this for my Canon SX20 IS.  The inside compartment tightly fits my camera and Sony batteries charger with the removable divider that came with the bag.  The charger hold 4 AA batteries so there where I kept my spares.  I had to place my camera side way in order to fit both.<br /><br />The only minor complains I have is the side pockets (tightly holds one small filter lense each side or 3-4 AA batteries).  The front pocket holds extra SD memory cards and small cable, where it can easily design with a little more room with no impacts from the overall look and size.  I would feel safer if the side pockets zippers don't go all the way down.
B005869U6G|5.0|I agree with what appears to be the majority of the other reviews in regards to the disappointment that Incubus' latest effort is mellow and lacking the harder yet catchy tracks that I really enjoy like Anna Molly or Megalomaniac.  However, I went back and listened to their other cds and it is my belief that their other releases had a number of filler songs that I would just prefer to skip.  I can't say the same about their latest effort.  Although mellow, I don't believe there is a bad song and the music is fantastic.  One of the better cds that I have purchased this year.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Swiftkey's prediction is top-notch, but when you're writing things that it can't predict - which is often - Swype is the better choice.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|honestly, with all the build up of the two previous books, you would think that the writer would know how to tie up the ending nicely.  but this was the worst possible ending to a trilogy and almost seemed rushed and not thought out.  disppointing and will honestly have people going \\"what?\\" by the end.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT, so dont read on..<br /><br />3 pivotal characters are met with quick and wasted endings... the reader is left wondering why, like i was.
0446560073|4.0|Simon's Cat book is probably the most brilliant of the kitty books in market. Funny, creative and real. Sometimes I think this cat is real. Of course, his antics can hurt Simon when he is asleep or watching tv but he is so adorable you're able to forgive him. What has struck me most is that how Simon's graphics teach us to treat animals humanely and with special care. I am one of the fans and it is an excellent book. Loved it. Plus this book makes a great gift.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I haven't tried all the many keyboards for Android, but once I started using this one,  no reason to try any others. It has  I  in a keyboard and great looking themes to boot! The best part  that I got it as the free app of the  a year or so ago as well! I'd still definitely pay for it though if  had to.
0195073401|3.0|This tome was recommended to me in my first year of graduate school at Oxford. It is a great reference, and learning from it will give you a solid foundation in microeconomics. However, the product is vastly overrated and there are superior textbooks. MWG's writing style is also boring.     The sections on game theory were particularly disappointing. To supplement them, I would suggest Herb Gintis' \\"Game Theory: Evolving\\" (Second Edition), or perhaps even Tirole.     In short, purchase this book if you're an economics graduate student, but don't make it your primary resource.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I purchased this from the Android Market some time ago.  In addition to having a really nice prediction algorithm I find the positions of the alternate symbols on the keyboard to be more useful than the stock Android keyboard.
B004SKIPXW|4.0|Drive Angry, good movie if you are looking for a 3D movie,the story of the movie is ok,Mr.Cage has done better movies!,but the 3D is worth it,not the best 3D,but good enough..and it has some scenes that are so dumb that it's funny!..it's like a grind house movie,if you like Robert Rodgriuez movies or Quentin Tarantino...you will like this!..and don't forget the 3D!..makes it better!..I give the movie 3.5 stars and the 3D 4 stars.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I finally got the chance to watch this film with my high school daughter, who is required to watch it for some AP environmental science course.  After \\"Climategate\\" and all the fallout since, I found this movie both interesting and disturbing, but not from a climate change perspective.    Propaganda is often described as providing biased or misleading information as a means to promote a particular cause.  These kinds of films were used often in wartime, by all sides, and the film techniques, as well as content chosen to include in the film, make this a propaganda film that fits all definitions.    We all know we must do more to help our planet. Sadly, the \\"global warming\\" bubble has burst, but this film must be preserved as it is an amazingly good example of an important genre.
B003B02O3C|5.0|This was my second Grisham novel and I have to say it was very compelling. I didn't see that ending coming and I can't honestly say I saw it ending any other way. Rudy Baylor's story isn't a very happy one but it is extremely entertaining. It brings in the grim reality of the law and shows a young law student how tough the world truly is.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I bought this because I had originally tried the Lite version out on my iTouch. I saw that it was on sale for 99 cents and decided to get it for my phone instead. Its a really cute game and makes you think. I like the play games whenever I get bored or need something to do to keep me busy while waiting for things. This app is a good pass time and its really creative. Its worth the purchase, there are plenty of levels for you to get through!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is a timeless character. You can read these stories again and again without getting tired of them. Sherlock Holmes and Watson are two fascinating people. Against a backdrop of Victorian England, these stories are fascinating. Sometimes one can deduce the crime and sometimes not. It does not matter. Watching Holmes at work is a privilege. I highly recommend this book and all Sherlock Holmes books.

B005DC68NI|5.0|If you're a writer you are going to need to own this eBook. It's full of common-sense practical advice, outlining the steps involved in self-publishing eBooks and breaking it down in a simple yet comprehensive way. Best of all, it's a fun and easy read.<br /><br />Like his peers Barry Eisler and J.A Konrath, David Gaughran makes a rock-solid case for going DIY as a writer. Let's Get Digital is smart and compelling and inspiring and I, for one, am sold.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|This app collects and stores remotely everything you type. Read the EULA when you start the app. They then sell that info to other companies. Very shady app developer. DO NOT TRUST!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|UPDATE:  The SKX update cured all the outstanding issues I had with the application.  I can offer an unreserved recommendation for this keyboard.  As someone coming from a physical Blackberry keyboard, and how obviously great that was, I really struggled with the stock Android soft keyboard.  I tested virtually all of the leading 3rd party keyboards.  Swiftkey X is, bar none, the best of the bunch.    One note that might not be obvious: I e-mailed the developer with the problem (my original review is copied below), and within hours I had a response.  They mentioned they were on the case, and that they took my concern seriously.  I'm sure as a matter of coincidence, yet hours later they e-mailed me again alerting me to the fact that they were just releasing an update, and when the update had propagated through the Android/Amazon marketplaces, they expected the problem to be resolved.  It was.  I mention this because with Android phones as complex as they are, there are almost ASSURED to be minor bugs.  This experience serves as evidence that this developer team is customer focused, and continues to work hard after the release to ensure as positive a user experience as possible.  For that, five stars are warranted.    OLD REVIEW:    Don't get me wrong: SwiftKey is my keyboard of choice.  However,  for whatever reason, Swiftkey X doesn't play nice with the mail client on my HTC Thunderbolt.  I even emailed the developer within problem, which was widely reported on their own bug report system, and they basically threw their hands in the air.    Bought the final version to see if they fixed it... nope. Back to Swiftkey non-X for me. The arrows are a nice addition, however.
0345529057|5.0|Amazing books, and the quality is what you'd expect with a mass-market paperback.  The fourth book had 2 pages missing, but I contacted the publisher and they sent a new copy ASAP at no cost to me.  The price was also great for 4 huge books.  The cover art for the actual books was also very nice.  Although the box had the image from the TV show, the books themselves have art on the front which I liked.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I watch these dvds over and over...I get through to the end and just start over again. My only complaint is that 3 of the discs were scratched so that I was unable to watch a few of the episodes. It's fun to follow the lives of Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha. Buy the movies (\\"Sex and the City\\" 1 & 2) and you'll have the entire story!

054531058X|1.0|I bought this book because people recommended it and hoping to like it, I wanted to read the trilogy before the movies come out but it was a big disappointment. After having read the Stag Larsson Millenium trilogy I was hoping to have found another good trilogy to read but it was tough to even finish the first book. It didn't do anything for me. It was not a page turner and it was easy to put it down. Do yourself a favor and pass on this trilogy.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|For the price the case works very well.  It will protect your phone short of a major accident. The only problem is that it is almost as bulky as the Otter Case that I've been using. Still, if you're like me and you need a case that will keep your phone from getting scratched up, you can't beat the price.

B002GJT4YQ|5.0|This edition is fantastic!  Not only is the HD DVD an excellent way to view the movie, but the extras are worth every penny of the price.  Lots of fun in store for those who enjoy learning about  behind the scenes activities.  Combined with the ultimate set for Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter fans will have an informative and entertaining view of the films and how they were made, including lots of footage of the stars in interviews and auditioning.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used Swiftkey X throughout the beta and when it launched in the market I snapped it up on the first day when it was offered for $1.99, but I would have gladly shelled out the full price of 3.99 as well. I had a feeling that it would be offered as a free download on Amazon at some point, but I was happy to support the developers. There should be no reason to not grab it for free and give it a try. It's a great keyboard, and the predictions are almost scarily spot on. It may not be for everyone, especially those who prefer Swype, but that should be no reason to rate it low. Just be sure to launch the actual application first before using it to properly set it up.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|I was not remotely a fan of Lady Gaga's - in fact when she started getting very broad publicity I hardly took note.  But there she was --- EVERYWHERE!  I was hearing songs that I thought were fun, exuberating, only to discover it was Lady Gaga.  I had sworn I'd never buy into a trending new musical artist (unless I could compair them to one of my favorites from yesteryear) but Lady G changed my mind.  I am happy to have her latest CD joining the 500-plus that I already have, not to mention the vinyl I started collecting as a kid.  Yes, Lady Gaga is sharp, talented and COOL.  Gotta love her! Hey, Lady Gaga, why not come out on vinyl?? There are so many of us who prefer it and it would be a SO cool thing to do!  I can see you make it happen - vinyl rules!!!
1442419814|4.0|One of the stories that stands out the most for me this year is The Uglies by Scott Westerfield.  The book is about a society where there are \\"uglies\\" and \\"pretties.\\"  The \\"uglies\\" are the children who are under the age of sixteen.   The \\"pretties\\" are the \\"uglies\\" who have been transformed into being \\"pretty\\" when they turn sixteen.  This transformation happens to everbody in \\"The Pretty's City.\\"  The main character of the book is a girl named Tally who has not turned sixteen and longs to be pretty.  Her best friend Paris has already made the transformation and has almost completely forgotten about Tally.  Tally likes to spy on the \\"pretties\\" and pull pranks on them as a past time.  While spying on the \\"pretties\\" one night she meets another \\"ugly\\" named Shay and they become best friends.  Shay introduces Tally to a place called The Smoke outside the city of \\"pretties. \\" The Smoke is a secret hideaway for people who reject the requirement of becoming \\"pretty.\\"  The Smoke people believe that conforming to other people's ideal of beauty is wrong and they have formed their own society.  By visiting The Smoke, Tally begins to understand why some people would want to stay themselves and not change how they look and who they are.  At first it seems like it would be so much easier for Tally to just become pretty because, on some level, this is what we all want for ourselves.  Most people would love to have beauty handed over that easily.  But as the story progresses, we see that the way people live at The Smoke is happier.  They have remained their true selves and are ultimately more free.  The novel explores the theme of not changing who you are just to be like everyone else.   I liked this book because it shadows what society is like today.  Everyone is supposed to be skinny and have the right make-up and hair.  Just like in the novel The Uglies, it feels like there are such high standards to live up to.   Tally is a character we can all relate to.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Word prediction is nice. I had a 13% efficiency boost in the SwiftKey Statistics. Hopefully that goes up now after upgrading to X.<br /><br />- The ability to have arrow keys is GODLY for phones without a trackball. Thanks for this! Why don't more keyboards do this?<br /><br />- Reason for 4 stars: I wish there was a way to have more suggestions. 3 is often too little. An option to use 4 or 5 would be great, especially for those of us with large-screened phones (4.3\\"+). (And before people complain, notice I said an *OPTION*, as in an optional choice in the settings menu.)<br /><br />- Also I wish there was a way to quickly capitalize words like Swype does. Select the word, press Shift, and it gives you the choice of word/Word/WORD. This would be convenient in many cases.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Someone described this before as the X files meets Twin Peaks, and they weren't wrong. But I think it may be even slightly better, as if those two shows weren't already wonderful.<br /><br />This is fresh and lightly done weirdness, with a picturesque town that seems almost normal, and yet just isn't quite. Full of characters, excellent twists on the mutant powers seen in X men and so many other works of fantasy, but described as troubles rather then gifts, mainly because whatever the new guy has got as his or her talent, just isn't under his control. And half the mystery of each show is simply trying to work out what power is at work and who has it, because they don't make it obvious early on.<br /><br />Best of all though, the ending. I won't give away any spoilers, but the twists were unexpected, not telegraphed in any way, and better yet, it doesn't explain all the mysteries. It saves that for season two.<br /><br />I can't wait.<br /><br />Cheers.
0439023491|5.0|In Catching Fire, by Suzanne Collins our favorite tributes are back with Katniss and Peeta after they've won the 74th annual hunger games. They begin the novel with embarking on the Capitol's cruel Victory tour around the districts. Picking up where Hunger Games left off, Katniss and Peeta have made history with it being the first time more than one tribute has ever survived the Hunger Games. In the aftermath of their rebellious poison berry act, the 12 districts of Panem are in quite a stir and rumors of an uprising begin to pick up more steam than ever before. Even worse for Katniss is the fact that she now appears to be the primary symbol of the revolution and uprising that everyone is hoping for. Much to the shock of no one, President Snow is not very pleased with what the result of the 74th Hunger Games have caused.<br /><br />The Capitol becomes increasingly more aware and even afraid of a very real possibility of a major uprising, the likes of which have not been seen in nearly 75 years. After a visit from President Snow, Katniss is made quite aware of the dire consequences that will await her, Peeta, and all of those they hold dear to them if they do not put on an extremely convincing display of love for each other during the Victory Tour.<br /><br />Soon after the Victory Tour, preparations for the 75th annual Hunger Games are made. However, these hunger games will allow the Capitol to introduce a little bit of a twist with it being the third Quarter Quell. Every 25 years, a Quarter Quell takes place in which the lucky contestants all happen to be previous winners of the Hunger Games and have varying ages from 14 to even 80 years old. There are some very intriguing bits of information in the second part of the book as there are even rumors of a secret district and the intrigue for the reader only gets better from there.<br /><br />The third part of Catching Fire deals with the 75th Hunger Games. Per usual, there are no shortage of surprises that Collins draws up for her readers. Surprise alliances are formed, romantic relationships deepen, and all new stops from the game makers are introduced. It becomes clear that Capitol will stop at nothing to have one tribute alive yet again and even then that doesn't appear to be a guarantee.<br /><br />What I liked most about Catching Fire was the coming of age for Katniss as a much deeper and stronger character. I also liked the fact that this book was so much more than just the first book re-hashed. The reader is filled in with a tremendous amount of backdrop information as the power structure of Panem and the people of the 12 districts are explored in much more detail than the previous book in the series. Arguably, there is a case for stating that waiting nearly two-thirds of the book is too long for the real action to start, but as the reader goes along it's clear to see why the book was laid out this way.<br /><br />As I said before, I couldn't quite give this book 5 stars (even though I did with ratings of 4.5 stars not existing). It's a solid 4.5 stars though mainly because it just didn't have the same shock value and freshness that the first book did. That often can be the case when the first book is great and then the second one doesn't quite measure up. That being said, Catching Fire is no slouch of a sequel and I really enjoyed reading it. I can only hope the finale holds up to the first two!<br /><br />-Travis Sws up for her readers.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|The TV series Haven is great. It is a somewhat fantasy drama with a very creative story line, fun characters, and to top things off, the location photography is assume. My wife and I were hooked within 10 minutes.
0792840461|5.0|This is the original Thomas Crown affair. I have had the VHS version of the film for years and decided to purchase the DVD because they are easier to store. Steve McQueen is brilliant in this movie and looks the part of a successful business man who is bored and seeking a new challenge. In this version Faye Dunaway plays the part of the insurance investigator tracking Mr. Crown. In the newer version she appears again, this time as the psychologist dealing with the personal issues challenging Mr. Crown and his ambitions. I doubt if Steve McQueen had ever made a bad movie in his short life and this one is just another Steve McQueen Classic worth seeing!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|In the language selection, there are no Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.  This sucks!  It simply limits users' intention from using it because they can not easily switch between their language and others.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|First, if you're concerned about privacy you shouldn't be on a smartphone, the internet, use credit cards or leave your house.   With that said, this has replaced every keyboard I thought was &quot;The One&quot;, including Swype. The best keyboard for Android.   Oh, and it's ok to come out from under that rock. This app is no more risky than trusting Amazon, Visa, or even your bank to keep your private info confidential.
B000063DI8|5.0|Let there be no doubt: This is an amazing album!    This was the album that turned me into a metal/Maiden-fan. I was stunned from the first moment I heard it. No other album caught my attention like this one did. Not even Seventh Son, which I heard the day after this one. It was just so raw, cool, catchy. The songs were amazing, Bruce sounded like a wild animal, there was a lot of energy in the playing. It sounded to me like a band that was on fire.    I can understand that some people (including Adrian Smith) found it to be a downgrade from the epic style of \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\". And when expectations aren't met, it can be disappointing. But that doesn't mean it's worse.     Even though I later learned to appreciate the incredible qualities of the epic albums that came before, I still love the fact that they went back to basics with this one. For me it was, and still is, a perfect album. (even though the production could have been a little better, and I'm not a big fan of Holy Smoke and Bring Your Daughter..). It doesn't sound like \\"Iron Maiden\\" or \\"Killers\\", but it's based on the same principles as those two. Fast, easy songs with a lot of energy. And it does have hints of the Seventh Son sound here and there. Moonchild, for example, wouldn't have been out of place on this one.    This is one the albums I would recommend to people who love 80's metal, but can't quite get into Maiden. It's just easy, catchy, hard rocking songs. And the whole style is very easy to get into and dig. Don't get fooled into thinking this is a turd, because it's definitely not. It's a fantastic album as long as you don't compare it to anything, and just enjoy it for what it is.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I have not had this much enjoyment from a free game in quite some time. The concept is simple, and once you get the hang of it, you will be thinking of possible combinations all day long... Great fun.
0553801473|1.0|I give up. I can't even finish reading this because it's just too painful to experience the disconnect from the previous books in the series. Nothing much seems to happen, characters argue and talk and eat and travel. When things do happen they don't really seem to make sense. Most chapters involving characters from the first three books just don't ring true in some way.<br /><br />I'm not completely convinced that GRRM actually wrote the majority of this book. It simply doesn't build on what has come before. Old characters spin their wheels while unnecessary new characters pop into existence. The only explanation I can think of is that this book was constructed and edited with future seasons of the TV series in mind.<br /><br />Dance With Dragons feels like it was ghost written by somebody who has no real emotional connection to the old characters. Classic TV plot devices like cliffhangers and reversed deaths are used with abandon. Shocking dramatic events often had a huge emotional impact in the earlier books. But here they just feel like manipulative plot devices for ending a TV episode.<br /><br />It's really quite shocking just how bad this huge, meandering mess of a book is. It's hard for me to imagine anybody giving it a five star review. But, then again, I always underestimate the degree to which people become emotionally invested in works of fiction.<br /><br />My advice is to avoid this book. In fact, don't even start the book series if you haven't already. Just enjoy the HBO TV series. The producers on HBO are likely to keep the plot moving along nicely. Also you are guaranteed to get one new season per year for as long as it runs. In contrast the book series has jumped the rails, hurtled down the ravine and crashed into a great steaming mass of debris.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|i can't believe they actually want money for this piece of crap.  the key layout is terrible, not to mention they put the backspace right on top of the send key.  the predictive text is fairly good, but good grief the typing is awful.  i went right back to the default android keyboard.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using the Original SwiftKey for a few months now and when this came out i knew it would be amazing and it is.    It's the only keyboard i use. It's easy and i really love how it's more personalized to your style of typing so that it will know what you're going to say next.    One of the best keyboards out there.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I bought the MC-DC2 to use with my Nikon D7000, since the simple wireless remote that I had previously purchased did not allow me to control the camera in bulb mode.  The cable release is well-made, and plugs into the GPS port.  It works perfectly and is quite useful when in mirror lock-up mode.
0307716511|4.0|A good triller, not a page turner for me and I am surprised as the writing style is one that many women can relate to: when we want to update someone, it is often a replay of the whole dialogue (so my husband tells me!).  I found the details a little too much and had on occasions lost the plot as I was not focusing on the storyline as I would have liked with a thriller.  But the details made the relationship between the two sisters really realistic!<br />So the story telling is much in that vein: we learn about the before and after finding the youngest and missing sister (I will try and not give too much plot away) through the various dialogues had between the two sisters as remembered by the older sister.  So you learn of the people in the life of the missing sister and how little the family knew of her life and how much of the past crept into the story line.  Haha, family issues and insecurities come into play as well as the older sister, having given up her job, looses all that tied her down in her former life, and is now hunting for the truth, doing her own detective work since the authorities were satisfied with the outcome and considered the case closed.  It is really worth pursuing to the end of this book as I was a little shocked with the ending.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is what the native Android keyboard should be have been. Word completion/suggestions are nice, but I just like the more intuitive keyboard layout. Well done!

B0043GXYBO|4.0|It's just my opinion but I really dislike Twilight read the first book and hated almost every page of it. So why do I like this book that is also about vampires/vampyres the other characters are a little more 3 dimensional they also evolve as the books go on. To be honest this series reminded me of Harry Potter more than twilight.     Though I do agree that Zoey can be whiny but most teenage girls are. I don't mind the way she talks because I often talked the same way it just looks different written. I'm more rating the series as an whole. MARKED just sets up stage. I wouldn't call this a novel for anyone but more for teen girls. It's Hogwarts for vampyers(though Harry Potter is in an entirly different league)
055357342X|5.0|I never read Science Fiction. I read mysteries, thrillers and horror books. It seems like every series I have been reading over the years has gotten worse or too expensive for my Kindle. One day while looking for something new to read, I stumbled over this series, so I thought, what the heck, I'll buy one and if it sucks, I'll stop. Well, I'm on the third one now and I wish I had've just bought the whole series at once. I cannot put these books down. I read til late and get up and read. I read all day if I can. Saturdays and Sundays have become reading days. I love the story lines, the characters, the way we get a chapter at a time of what is going on with each character and how each chapter leaves you wanting more. I want to know what's going on with Catelyn, Bran, Tyrion, Davos and everyone else all the time. I also love the fact that the books don't get shorter and shorter as the series continues. I LOVE THIS SERIES, and am already sad that when I get through the ones here, I am going to have to wait for a new one.
B0010HA68I|5.0|I used these straps to attach to my Lowepro Versapack 200AW bag and they work perfectly.

0670022411|3.0|I would give it 5 points for English academia, libriaries, ancient books and discussion of history and alchemy.  I half expected Lord Peter Wimsey to come walking around the corner, and that is high praise.  He would be very comfortable in this book.       For the rest, it did seem like \\"Twilight\\" collided with \\"The Thread that Binds the Bones\\" (by Nine Kiriki Hoffman to produce this book.  To me, the most original idea was the daemons.  I immediately thought of the likes of Jim Morrison and Vincent van Gogh.      I have to agree with other views that the heroine is very Mary Sue (and annoying).  Her description even matches that of the author in some ways.

1572814136|5.0|I am a beginner. I have adapted well to the cards. They are brightly colored and very appealing to the senses.
0802130208|4.0|This book was good, I have to admit it.  I usually disagree with critics so this is a one off for me.  I am afraid all the promises of \\"comic fugue\\" might have contributed to my lack of laughter until most of the way through the book.  I actually didn't crack a laugh until about 2/3 of the way through the story, at a point when George, having paid money, gets stuck babysitting the weenie wagon.  Then I about rolled over in stitches there and for a few pages after that.  Perhaps Ignatius (is this supposed to be a pseudonym for Ignoramus?) is so astonishingly dimwitted that part of me altogether rejected his worldview.  It was grating to read his written diatribes. I mostly skimmed them.  Oh, and, maybe I'm too innocent, but I found the relationship between himself and his mother to be depressingly grating.  It's just not pleasant to read stuff like that again and again throughout the book.    That said, the characters are amazingly well developed, complex and satisfying.  I LOVED the ending, loved the fact that Ignatius the Ignoramus had maybe 5-10% good sense and numerous redeeming qualities, including liking cats and rolling like a plump wheel of fortune himself (as another reviewer said) and eventually bumbling his way to helping several people to a positive conclusion.    Another thing I liked is that Ignatius (the Ignoramus) was a pure and total failure, from beginning to end.  NOTHING whatsoever came out the way he envisioned it, in fact EVERYTHING came out to be opposite, including (and delightfully) the ending.  The way the tension developed in his relationship with Myrna minx was very good and contributed a lot to the satisfying ending.  The fact that things go the opposite way to his liking but turn out well makes the book very, very satisfying to read.    I would read it again.  Despite not laughing that much, it was time well spent and enriching.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Just downloaded SwiftKey X and using it to type this review. So far, so good. Sure it'll take getting used to,  but that's fine. The word prediction is excellent. The failure to capitalize the first word of a new sentence is odd. I also wish that the word recommendation bar slid to offer more than three words. Hopefully future updates will continue to improve it. Overall, 5 stars?

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The narrator/main character is quite believably drawn in his teen arrogance and bad attitude. The development of his character is one of the stronger points of this novel dotted with sepia-colored photographs from a bygone era. Unfortunately, these pictures that inspired the author to weave his peculiar story end up disrupting the natural flow of the narrative, as bits of dialogue are inserted to describe photos that may serve as creative inspiration on their own, but feel awkwardly inserted after the story took shape.    Also, how irritating and presumptuous to end the first novel with a \\"to be continued\\" scenario.

0312430000|4.0|The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande  * A friend recommended this author and I really enjoyed the book, it's focus is mainly on medical applications, but could also be very useful in production or other areas with a bit of complexity. I'd rate it an 8 out 10 as a business book.   * The thrust of the book is that we all make dumb mistakes, but in a situation where a dumb mistake can be critical, you'd be much better off making a check list, so you can catch those little mistakes that can sink things for you.   First Examples  * First Examples are of surgeons who failed to note a something that might cost someone there life. These people are smart, well trained, experts in their field. But relying on memory for vital steps is flawed with constant interruptions, complexity and pressures in life. Check lists help you not to miss the dumb stuff we all miss on a regular basis.   Good Quotes from the Book  * \\"We don't study routine failures...when we look closely, we recognize the same balls being dropped over and over, even by those of great ability and determination. We know the patterns. We see the costs. It's time to try something else. Try a checklist.\\"   * \\"It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment.

0891419063|5.0|I never served in the military but I had the privilege of visiting Peleliu twice during the late '60s while living on Guam Island.  While viewing what in the '60s had reverted to jungle-covered mountains--except for the remaining 'live ammo' signs in the jungle, pristine beaches and exploring old Japanese caves still holding evidence of the war, I tried to imagine what the war must have been like in the mid '40s.  Nothing I ever imagined came close to what E.B. Sledge records in \\"With the Old Breed at Peleliu and Okinawa.\\"<br /><br />He writes with skill and objectively records what it was like to live on the front lines day after day as an infantryman in unbelievable conditions.  Writers of Hollywood's war epics which make all seem exciting never stood next to Sledge on coral-covered hillsides or endured what he and so many others suffered so that we may have freedom.  Thank you Dr. Sledge for telling us \\"the rest of the story.\\"
0062060554|3.0|Truly, I found myself wanting to read this book and finished it pretty much overnight, an unusual feat.  However, as the plot unfolds and the pieces fit together, I was really disappointed.  The author's legerdemain became transparent and contrived.  HIS (not her!) writing is quite accomplished but the book as a whole was, for me, a FLOP.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I installed this from the Android Market the other day and have since gone back to regular SwiftKey.  The app causes my Messaging app to force close once every 2 - 3 days, requiring a phone restart to fix.  Will give it another shot once this bug is fixed, but for now it will stay uninstalled.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Way better than the standard keyboard. I can type much faster and virtually error free now. Typing is very smooth and natural.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Would you believe I was just about to buy this on the Android Market? Thanks Amazon!  Swiftkey is a great keyboard replacement, especially for those who don't have Swype. I tried the beta version of this app and it really does learn your habits!  Keep those great apps coming!

She would not part with her copy, so, to encourage him to read more since he was so interested, I got it for him. I can't speak for myself, but can only tell you the reaction from my grandchildren and from others I have spoken to.

0817439390|4.0|I ordered this book for two reasons (1) I just purchased an entry-level DSLR and (2) a friend who is an avid ameteur photographer recommended it.<br /><br />Some background information about me (because it does matter, especially if you read the other reviews): I took some basic photography classes in college, I developed much of my own film in college, I've been an amateur photographer since high school (mid 1980s), and I have used both film and digital formats. I'm smart and understand the basics regarding light, composition, shutter speed, etc.<br /><br />Please understand what you are purchasing before you spend money on this book. I wanted an easy-to-understand bok on exposure that would serve as a good refresher. (Too many years using inexpensive \\"point and shoot\\" cameras tend to dull one's memory). Peterson's book -- a long-time best-seller in this particular genre -- is just that. It's geared towards the amateur photographer, contains many sets of \\"comparison\\" images (i.e., same image with different settings so you can understand the differences in camera settings), and is not overly technical.<br /><br />Amazon does allow you to \\"look inside\\" the book prior to purchasing it. Peruse the content available to you and then make the decision as to whether or not you want to spend your money. In my opinion, the book is a worthy addition to your library of photography \\"how to\\", especailly if you are an amateur photographer or, like me, need a mere brain boost. Peterson is an expert in the field and, like anybody, has his opinions. You may agree with some; you may disagree with others. So be it. The information in the book is based on his many years taking images as a professional photographer, and he has written in a style that will appeal to a wide audience.<br /><br />If you want a more general text, Peterson does offer Understanding Digital Photography. If you want to know more about shutter speed: Understanding Shutter Speed. If you're into close-up (macro) photography: Understanding Close-up Photography.<br /><br />If you want a more specific text with tons of technical detail (I.e., geared more towards the academic, engineer, professional photographer), this book -- admittedly -- is probably not what you are looking for. But you could have easily figured that out before spending any money.<br /><br />In my amateur-photographer-smart-and-educated opinion? A good book. And I'm not at all upset I spent my money on it.lose-up Photography.

B0051MKNV8|5.0|Science fiction, action, and thrills work through a twisty plot finally to catapult Bradley Cooper into his rightful place as an actor who can hold a film equal with Robert DiNero. His grunge is as equally convincing as his brilliance (but, of course, his brilliant role shows handsome good looks to advantage and a good swoon to those who see).<br /><br />The sci-fi premise is revealed in a clear pill that contains ingredients that enhance brain power from the basic 20% we use to 100%. Imagine! As a man who has wasted years of his life trying to write and living the rejected writer's life, he is given a pill that can literally give him a new lease on life. Is this pill approved by the FDA, as the provider promises? At this point, who cares? Eddie Morra (Cooper) certainly doesn't and in a very limited time space, gulps it. At the initial use of this synaptic pulse that ignites a dynamo, the landlord's wife is berating him for rent abuse. Director Neil Burger brilliantly reveals visually the course this synaptic bursts take from one point to the next in expanding Eddie's brain. Everything he has ever heard or seen or read are ordered into a seemingly limitless variety of ways that can help Eddie achieve.<br /><br />And so he does. He writes that book, but in another moment of clarity, he sees the direction his life can take. Again, the director's message is that whatever personality traits a person has, that is where the drug reaches in to enhance. His girlfriend takes one pill to elude a strong-arm and learns that she has a sharp, scary side she does not want to revisit. Evil is personified through other characters who also take the drug. Eddie's ambition seems limitless. But then so do the after effects that the drug slams on the user<br /><br />Other reviewers criticized what they saw as plot holes. I saw them as eccentricities in a story of man's chance to really do something significant. For significance is the final direction Eddie Morra takes. The film has one of those really satisfying, pleasing endings that the viewer cannot predict.<br /><br />In a society in which women enhance their physical attributes, men enhance their sexual and athletic performances, \\"Limitless\\" asks us to study the effects of one man reaching the limits of his intelligence, and then some. It's a job well done: the movie, the performances, the visual effects, the action, the theme.g, pleasing endings that the viewer cannot predict.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Not going to review the movie because we all know what it's about.  My kids (5 & 7) watch it over and over.  Great looking bluray.  Thought about getting the original too since my kids love this movie so much but I have a feeling the special effects of the first would not \\"wow\\" them and it might be on the slow side for them.  Tron: Legacy has a nice pace with great special effects.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|I had absolutely no doubt that these series would be full of joy and entertainment when I placed the order since I loved the Planet Earth series earlier as much! Many in above reviews gave tons of credit to Attenborough's narration, which is unequivocally valid and true! His British accent with a slight mouth-filled-with-saliva tone delivers a spectacular entertainment experience! Of course, the quality of the video image and choreography of events placed after each-other also deserve equal praise!    Just amazing and highly recommended!
0553801473|2.0|GRRRM writes another novel in his ASIAF series, this time focusing on events in the North and Essos, showing us what happened in these areas during AFFC.<br /><br />The problem is that NOTHING happens. GRRM pulled one of the biggest bait and switches setting up two immense events in the book- and resolving nothing.<br /><br />Instead he decides he wants to write a 1000 page book along the lines of AFFC where we see Tyrion travel and give us observations on Essos much like the boring Brienne chapters in AFFC. Dany does nothing (except twiddle her thumbs), and Jon's story at the wall barely progresses. (E.g., Did we really need him to give us Jon's POV of events that Sam had described adequately enough? A waste of a chapter- interesting but entirely unnecessary).<br /><br />The few events in the North that are interesting and keep the story moving at even a moderate pace are few and far between and end early (we never see Davos once again after certain events leading to some action....).<br /><br />Anyway, you don't need to me to harp on how terribly inadequate and unsatisfying this book was. I would recommend waiting till he releases more before you waste your time reading a prologue (that really wouldn't warrant a second read-through).
B001TH16DS|3.0|Introducing my kids (5 & 7) to the world of Star Trek.  They are mesmerized despite the somewhat slow pace of the episodes compared to today's movies.  One thing though, the volume on the main menu screen is nice and strong but when an episode is selected the volume goes WAY WAY down.  So far down I can't hear voices unless I crank it up.  Does anyone else experience this?

0385505833|5.0|Ok. Haven't we all been there?? Or at least we wanted to be? This book is about Luther and Nora Krank, who finally plan the Christmas that THEY want, and it brings all sorts of havoc down on them - but in a very funny way. The irony and humor is obvious, and that makes the book even more fun...their last name is Krank, and they decide to Bah-Hum-Bug Christmas!?  Grisham is writing about what many of us occasionally rail against - conformity and convention. Yet, it is that very event that reminds the Kranks why they \\"put up with\\" the conformity and convention. Yes, the ending is sappy, but very endearing - and it works....what else would you expect from a Christmas-themed book? It stays on my must re-read bookshelf.

1451629184|5.0|I remember the news coverage when Jaycee Dugard was obducted.  I recall the images of her sweet face on the screen, and how her mom was desperate for any sign of her little girl.  That sign didn't come till nearly two long decades later, but through a miracle, their reunion happened and their worlds can once again be one.  I cried tears of joy to see that reunion, because as a parent of young daughters, I cannot fathom how they got through those 18 years.<br /><br />This is Jaycee's story, in her own words, in her own way, and it is raw and real.  She shares photos from her early childhood, of happy times with her mom, her baby sister, her love of outdoors and animals.  She paints for us the picture of a self conscious little girl, intimidated by a less-than-loving stepfather, Carl.  And we see a child who doesn't make friends easily, but when she does, they are for life.  Then Jaycee rips the fences away.  From the details of the very morning of her abduction, to the recovery process with her family years later upon reuniting, she minces no words when describing the horrors she withstood in her captivity.  She describes sounds, smells, feelings, and fears; yet through it all, she holds onto hopes and dreams.  Her ability to steel herself against the unthinkable at the hands of lunatic and drug addicted convicted child molestor, Phillip Garrido, and his accomplice wife, Nancy, are a testament to the power of the mind and spirit to overcome the worst of human conditions.<br /><br />Jaycee was taken against her will, forced to do as her abductors told her, forced to bear two children whom she loves and cares for deeply, and forced to exist in conditions unfit for any living creature.  She takes us on her journey year by year, and reveals her affinity for cats, horses, even a spider that made it's way into her confines.  She cares for and loves these animals and finds comfort in their presence, until her monster kidnapper steals even this little bit of joy away from her.  In the midst of the horrors, Jaycee managed to hold onto dreams of her future.  She teaches herself things, reads a lot and watches television.  She is aware of the world outside her prison, and though unsure of what she would do or how she would live if she were ever freed, she made lists of her favorite things in the world, her best hobbies, music and personal goals.  She showed such a solid and direct ability to be aware of things that should matter in the universe, even in the face of the complete injustice she was facing.<br /><br />The great tragedy was compounded over time as Garrido's parole officers managed to somehow miss the filthy compound in his backyard where Jaycee and her two daughters were literally \\"hiding in plain sight\\".  They could have been rescued countless years earlier, had a smart enough individual done their job correctly in the child welfare system.<br /><br />I found myself unable to put this book down until the very end.  My heart was so broken for the life these monsters took away, yet I was so grateful that she managed to keep her wits about her, not give up, not kill herself, not abandon her beautiful daughters, and never lose sight of that bright moon in the sky which was the only connection to her loving mother miles away.  Her determination not to allow hate to consume her body allowed her to begin the healing process upon resuce sooner than had she sunk deep into seclusion and rejected help from loving friends, relatives, and a community of support including therapists and doctors.  Through her honesty you can sense the pure joy for life and the ability to live free now, and it's evident that she will do great things in her future.<br /><br />Jaycee, you are a pillar of strength.  Thank you for opening up to share your story, and for THEJAYCFOUNDATION.org., your project to assist families going through similar traumatic experiences.In the midst of the horrors, Jaycee managed to hold onto dreams of her future.

This is a sad story but as you read you will be angered at how any mother could allow her children to remain in such conditions. Makes you wonder.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Not all will like this app, but you definitely can't beat it for free. I paid for this app and still use it over every other keyboard app. Give it some time to recognize your commonly used words and you won't regret it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey for years now. Purchased it at full price, and it's so worth it. Its ability to guess the next word is sometimes uncanny. You owe it to yourself to give it a try for a few days (it can take a while to get used to and for it to learn) and see whether it works for you.
0553801473|4.0|It was brain candy, but still an enjoyable read. I love how George R.R. Martin feels no compunction about killing off characters.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a great keyboard with awesome word prediction.<br /><br />I love it and I bought it before it was available here on Amazon.<br /><br />I am glad to see it here because I loathe that &quot;other&quot; marketplace.<br /><br />I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of 2 things.....<br /><br />1: The keyboard will not always swipe away, which can end up causing me to press the exit key.  Sometimes the exit key closes the keyboard and other times it closes the field I was typing in or backs out of the page, causing me to lose my type.<br /><br />This seems to happen randomly, at least I haven't seen any commonality to base feedback on yet.<br /><br />2: Something I personally find very annoying about SwiftKey X has to do with the version of the keyboard that appears during text messaging, the emoticons key is shared with the enter key and the emoticons key has presidence.<br /><br />Its a pain in the butt to have to long press the key to double space a line and it really slows my typing down.<br /><br />Hopefully a future update will include a customization option for that keys primary function.<br /><br />A spell check option would be icing on the cake....<br /><br />Nothing is perfect, but, this us a way better keyboard than the stock Gingerbread offering.<br />This is my favorite keyboard application thus far.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very good keyboard application for the droid better then all others on the market right now as it can predict what you are going to say next.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The fact that Jaycee would be even quasi-normal after her horrific abduction and captivity would be shocking but she seems to have put most of her experiences into perspective, has dealt with the emotional turmoil inflicted upon her and has come out of a very long, dark tunnel as an amazingly together woman.  Her story is disturbing, it is difficult to read at times, yet it is also a stirring account of what she endured and eventually overcame.  A recommended read.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|I too live on Calkins Creek, like Josh.  The Crum Well is earshot from my property.  There are no words to describe this monstrosity, which is a few hundred feet from the creek.  I fear the fracking blight every day.  My children wade in the creek.  That ridiculous well is one heavy rain from destroying the creek.  If they frack there it will be a crime.    For everyone that cares about the environment or their drinking water, this movie is essential.  Watching it will give you a sense of what it is like to live in constant fear of fracking and cancer causing chemicals in your air and water and destruction of your property.  There is a sense of helplessness that comes from dealing with gas companies, as if the destruction is inevitable.  The movie conveys this feeling.    Cheney committed a crime against us when he exempted fracking from EPA laws and regulations.  Watch the movie.  Take action.  Don't trust big companies and big government.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|As the other reviews have pointed out, this is a great app when it works.<br />Unfortunately, the current version has a bug that prevents it from working on the HTC Thunderbolt and some other HTC sense phones (only in the HTC mail app that you use to sync to work exchange, not the GMail app).<br />In the mail app, you not only lose word prediction, you also lose autocorrect completely, making this far worse than the stock android keyboard.<br />The publisher has had this bug listed as a known issue in the Android marketplace for a long time now, but has not fixed it.<br />What's the point of a keyboard app that doesn't work in mail?<br />Two stars until this serious bug gets fixed. Otherwise an excellent app.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I bought this keyboard over a year ago, about a week after I got my phone. Although it doesn't do swipe, swipe bugged me, and I was used to tap already. It's quick, small, and has TONS of options and statistics. This is worth the money.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a very emotional book to read, but not so overwhelming that I didn't want to finish. On the contrary, I found myself reading it every chance I had. It was so well written. I'm impressed that Jaycee could recall so much of her experience and in such detail. She is an excellent writer and expressed herself wonderfully. I consider her a heroine for surviving and now bringing meaning to her life and that of her daughters.
0553801473|2.0|Woweeee!<br /><br />I just finished A Dance with Dragons, and I AM STUNNED. This book was amazing!<br /><br />But I know what you're wondering. You want to know if this book is right for you! Well, ask yourself this:<br /><br />Does 1000 pages of repetitive scenes of rape, consensual sexual encounters (involving every age and gender combination imaginable), traveling, drinking, peeing, eating, traveling, pointless conversations between characters you don't care about and complete plot inertia sound like the book you've always wanted to read?<br /><br />If it does, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!<br /><br />Take this scene for example: \\"Jon Snow staggered blindly out of the tavern and found a quiet corner behind a crate of walnuts. These walnuts were shipped all the way from Azhkbar, where the walnut harvest had been particularly fruitful this year. In accordance with Azhkabari tradition, all the walnuts had been picked by the hands of thirteen year old virgins who wore blue on every full moon and washed their hands with the purest of olive oil; the walnuts were mostly traded for the incredibly delicate lace made in Zeerom, where a blight of walnut trees five years past had left a gaping hole in the economy that only the Azhkabari virgins could fill. Behind this crate of walnuts, Jon removed his trousers and took the biggest, longest, manliest pee in the whole history of men peeing. As he groaned in urinary ecstasy, he threw back his head and uttered, \\"I need another ale!\\" \\"<br /><br />Wow. With such pulse-pounding action, what other book do you need? I see myself re-reading this at least 28 times in the next year.<br /><br />...Okay...<br /><br />Now let's get serious for a moment.<br /><br />This book is 1000 pages of absolute nothing. The major events could be summed up in five or six sentences. To illustrate this, I will recount what every character in this book actually DOES. (Names removed so no spoilers.)<br /><br />Character A talks to people.<br />Character B travelsa bit.<br />Character C talks to some people.<br />Character D travels a lot.<br />Character E talks to dragons, and then talks to some people.<br />Character F travels, and then talks to some people.<br />Character G makes some decisions that nobody agrees with, then mopes a bit.<br />Character H falls off a pig.<br /><br />Irrelevant Character A talks with Irrelevant Character B while Mysterious Character C stands in the background and acts mysterious in a way that will remain completely irrelevant and indecipherable until the end of book 7 (if then).<br /><br />Has GRRM taken to channeling the spirit of Robert Jordan? His last two books have been NOTHING like the first three. Granted, they haven't descended to the level of Crossroads of Twilight, but he's getting closer and closer.<br /><br />Why are we getting new viewpoint characters 4,500 pages into this series? Does GRRM think there aren't enough yet?<br /><br />BTW, there's something to say for an author who knows the annual growth rate of a Meereenese Water Lily as a function of seasonal rainfall, but doesn't know how to get his own characters from one city to another.<br /><br />GRRM, if you're reading this (and I know you're not), please get a ghost writer for book 6. We won't hold it against you.<br /><br />I hear Brandon Saunderson will be available sometime next March.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Continuing in the tradition of AmazonBasic products, this case is a quality product at a very low price. It comes bundled with a screen protector.  The case is smoky and translucent. It's rubbery yet resistant and keeps its shape well, unlike the soft silicone cases which bend and warp easily.  The surround is raised to protect the screen in case of a fall. The case holds well in hand.  The back of the case features a hole that the Apple logo shows through. I found out I could place my work pass between the back of the phone and the cover, and use it as a lens protector for the camera by sliding it using the hole in the back. Clever uh?  All in all, a highly recommended case, like all AmazonBasic products.

0553573403|2.0|I'm not going o make this lengthy.<br />No doubts to Mr. Martin's skill as a writer nor his imagination. His plot line is good; his pros are decidedly English and not American, as are his visualizations. Each of the chapters of his \\"tomes\\" are decidedly protracted to say the least. His characters are good, but one does wonder why he created some and devoted hours of chapters on them only for the character to go nowhere and then be cast aside, without moving the story in any direction. As for some of the content of the chapters, the more you read the more predictable, (books 2 and 3).  I am personally a complete slut and not void of a naughty imagination, but really? As I waded through his books I begged the question perhaps his reason for these books was to prove to the porn industry that their rejections were unfounded, or perhaps he's just sexually frustrated? (If he was rejected by the porn industry we can see why).<br />I listened to an unabridged copy of book 4 A Storm of Swords, through an error in numerical loading I started with Prologue and chapter one then went directly to chapter 10 I listened all the way to chapter 19, had I not been awaiting the chapter on Arya which caused me to review my MP3 player I would never had caught the mistake? What does that say for MR. Martin?<br />My girlfriend tells me when I begin to ramble, perhaps Mr. Martin should pay heed to those who tell him, or at least get a better editor.<br />Good Story, not a good read.......Unless you're an insomniac!

B004WCTLNY|5.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting from The Adjustment Bureau.  What I got was a lovely romance set within the framework of a lesson about free will and tenacity.  From the beginning, I was captivated by the obvious chemistry between the two main characters, David and Elise, as they begin something only to have it end.  The rest of the movie is the search for the continuation of that promise with many twists and turns of fate and determination.  I highly recommend this movie!  It will make you begin to question as to how many of \\"their\\" plans you went along with in your life.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Kind of expected Apple product to work well.. plugged my camera in and it downloaded and organized all photos immediately.
0439023513|1.0|I liked Hunger Games a lot.  I liked Catching Fire less.  I didn't like Mockingjay at all.    I might have liked the development of the trilogy more if the author hadn't told all three stories from Katniss' viewpoint.  Because the problem is that Katniss disintegrates as a person in the course of the three books, and the story disintegrates with her.      In the first book, she does things.    In the second book, things are done to her.    In the third book, she is a complete mess as a result of the things she has done and the things that have been done to her.    Is this realistic?  Probably.  Does it make for good storytelling?  No.     I don't really object to Katniss developing PTSD.  After what she's been through, it would have been surprising if she didn't.  And I don't object to her being caught up in things she doesn't understand. She's a young person dealing with older people in positions of power.  It's to be expected.      But if an author's going to take a character in this direction -- basically, having her diminish in each book -- it would be better not to tell the whole story from her viewpoint.  It might have been better if each book's story had been told from a different viewpoint -- maybe Katniss for Hunger Games, Finnick for Catching Fire, and Gale for Mockingjay.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Love the options, especially for folder icons. Able to show all apps inside a folder. Now I can see exactly what I'm looking. Easy to set up and sort apps in each folder. Also able to name folders the way I need. almost passed this up. Glad I took advantage of free app of the day.
0553801473|4.0|I gave AFFC 2 stars in a previous review. IMO it exhibited gratuitous violence and a lack of cohesion with the author's previous efforts in the series. The graphic mutilation of children and a woman's face being savagely bitten two amongst many poorly rendered scenes. It seemed as if the author was attempting to write a screenplay for \\"The Hill's Have Eyes IX\\" or \\"SAW VIII\\" with the emphasis on rape/torture/mutilation ad nauseaum. The author seemed to settle for the gross out rather than a continuation of the wickedly original fantasy with it's compelling balance and mystery. The Cersei chapters were utter disasters. One dimensional potholes of boredom. Brienne who I find interesting as a major fringe character failed as a pov. There were other reasons for my disillutionment.<br /><br />A Dance With Dragons was definitely an improvement. Though it meandered at times the introduction and solid development of compelling minor and major characters was well implemented. The writing was precise and disciplined with much of Martin's previous energy and confidence. The story in total developed slowly but logically though Martin seems determined (unfortunately) to stick with the Cersei thread.<br /><br />I find myself again interested in the destinies of the denizens of Martin's world. I have tremendous hope for \\"The Winds Of Winter\\".
0061992860|4.0|Title really says it all.  The info is great and the content is thorough.  However, I find myself fearing for the structural integrity of the book itself.  It's a bit flimsy.
0553801473|2.0|Oops, sorry wrong series however ASOIAF has now more in common with the Wheel of Time series than you might think.<br /><br />Endless description of clothing, food, scenerey? Check!<br />No plot progression whatsover? Check!<br />Unlikeable female characters? Check!<br />Introducing an endless amount of unimportant side characters? Check!<br />Introducing very important main characters very late into the series and thus negating almost all that came before? Check!<br /><br />What happened?<br /><br />Now that ADWD is finally upon us I would like to ask GRRM why this book and AFFC were even necessary. Originally a leap in time should have taken place between ASOS and the next book.<br />However that was scrapped as GRRM thought too many flashbacks would be necessary to fill in the \\"important\\" events that would have happened in the meantime.<br /><br />After having read both AFFC and ADWD I don't see why these stories even needed to be told. E.g. Dany is still where she was at the end of ASOS and I would even say that her character evolved backwards.<br /><br />The first 500 (well-written) pages read like AFFC Part 2. However the last 450 pgs are full of typos and rambling prose. You have to wonder if an editor even looked at those pages.<br />You can tell that the first part was written a long time ago and the rest which takes place chronologically after AFFC was written in haste and send to the printer as is to just get the book done. 6 years of time and the book feels rushed...<br /><br />I've been a fan of GRRM and ASOIAF for over 12 years now and for the first time I am not eagerly anticipating the next book. I simply do not care anymore which is probably for the best as I don't think that this series will ever be finished.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|now i don't write many reviews, but this app deserves it. I was so frustrated with every keyboard I downloaded and just got sick of typing on my phone in general. then, I came across this keyboard. it is very effective in predicting words.. the fact that it can learn from your social networking sites is great because it just helps the predicting even more. i love the fact that you can choose your style.. i haven't really seen anyone else have that in a keyboard.. this app I feel was definitely worth the 4 dollars and they have updated it a couple times already.. the devs are right on things. definitely give this keyboard a try expecially becuae its free today. thank you for making me want to type in my phone again.

B004XANKVO|5.0|This is the nicest backpack I have owned in my life, and for $100+ it better be!  Then again I don't think I've really owned a backpack since college (more than a few years ago).    First off, when I first took this backpack out of the shipping box I could tell it was nice.  Very nice build quality with nice materials and nice subtle styling.  I noticed things like thick aluminum type zippers that look like they will not be breaking.    I brought this along on a family trip to Lake Tahoe and I only liked it more after that.  This backpack is deceptively able to pack a lot of stuff in it, but is compact when empty.  Besides my laptop and my tablet packed in their own protective compartment, I had a few beach towels packed in, a mid-size football, extra flip-flips, etc.  There is also a very cool special compartment with extra padding where I kept my cellphone.  I never hit the fill limit with this backpack, it kept taking everything I shoved in there over the weekend.  Backpack straps on this thing are thick, comfortable, and easy to adjust.    Overall, if you want a high quality versatile backpack then this is the one in my opinion.  Sometimes you do get what you pay for.    ----    **Captain's Log Update (Dec-18-2014):  My Thule backpack is still going strong.  I still use it regularly (it's visited three continents) and other than some minor wear/tear it still looks good.  Still the nicest backpack I owned and still 5 STARS.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This new version is fantastic not only does it improve upon the original swiftkey prediction but t is personalized for the user which is a great idea, also a better predictor for sloppy texters such as myself.

0553386794|5.0|I'm new to the series, have not even watched the HBO series, although that is what brought these books to my attention, and I wasn't disappointed, even with all the hype. George Martin has masterfully woven his complex tale of ancient houses in the 'seven kingdoms' plotting and battling for power. The intrigue never stops, and the twists and turns are surprising while still feeling valid - not just thrown in for kicks. I think what lifts this above most in the genre is that it is character-driven - the characters are complex and richly drawn, and every word and action feels true to them. The story centers around one character in each chapter, although all third-person narrative, and rotates between several different plotlines. It does require focus to keep track of it all, but once I had some familiarity with the characters, it became a real page-turner. I look forward to the rest in the series.

B000002GEY|5.0|This is the first album I was introduced to by Supertramp. My wife had purchased this and \\"Even In the Quiestest Moments\\" on vinyl for me a couple of years ago. I remember seeing the album cover on a poster some years back and it caught my eye briefly, though I wasn't aware of the content. And of course I heard \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" in bars and maybe on a friend's MP3. Sadly I haven't listened to any of their albums pre-Quiestest moments, such as \\"Crime of the Century\\". In due time. Anyway, after listening to the album a few times I was hooked, particularly on \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" and the title track. Funny thing is that I think Supertramp was shooting for a concept album of sorts, at least on a couple of the tracks. At this point they were already settled in the states as their new home base. Truthfully it doesn't matter though. They were shooting for the moon and hit it. Now I'll admit that a few of the songs had to grow on me. But give this album a chance if you want to listen to something a bit from the norm or ordinary. The entire first side is excellent, and \\"Take the Long Way Home\\" leads off the second half. Overall, a very solid effort from the Tramp. Although I prefer Quietest Moments over Breakfast, I did enjoy what I digested. Peace!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|If its got a horse in it, chances are I'm going to want to see it.  I've always loved horses and watched and read everything I could get my hands on throughout the years.  This movie was good, not spectacular, but solidly good.<br /><br />With  her mother's death and her father's slow deterioration, Penny Chenery has to decide what to do with their expansive horse farm.  The finances aren't going well and she has to consider whether or not to sell some of the horses.  But with a coin flip her future changes and she gets to witness the birth of Secretariat.  He does well starting out, but Chenery needs him to do better.  Her goal is for him to be a Triple Crown winner.  But can she keep the finances afloat to give him that chance, and even more, will he be the horse she thinks he is.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Diane Lane: Penny Chenery<br />John Malkovich: Lucien Laurin<br />Amanda Michalka: Kate Tweedy<br />Graham McTavish: Charles Hatton<br />Kevin Connolly: Bill Nack<br />Carissa Capobianco: Sarah Tweedy<br />Drew Roy: Seth Hancock<br />Scott Glenn: Christopher Chenery<br />James Cromwell: Ogden Phipps<br />Nelsan Ellis: Eddie Sweat<br />Dylan Walsh: John Tweedy<br />Fred Dalton Thompson: Bull Hancock<br />Eric Lange: Andy Beyer<br />Margo Martindale: Elizabeth Hamm<br />Otto Thorwarth: Ron Turcotte<br />Dylan Baker: Hollis Chenery<br />Stephen Stanton: Chic Anderson<br />Nestor Serrano: Pancho Martin<br /><br />Great actors in this movie.  Diane Lane did a spectacular job as Penny Chenery.  She really came across as loving the horse and wanting the best for it.  I also loved John Malkovich and the way he played Lucien.  The guy cracked me up throughout the entire movie but he also could be serious when needed.  The rest of the side characters were great as well and all were able to express their emotions well.  And needless to say, the horse was fantastic.  Behaved and trained well and really portrayed a great champion with poise.<br /><br />Since its a true story I'd have to say that they did a good job of sticking to the real story.  Of course there were some embellishments, but largely it seemed real.  And its a great story.  A real hero and feel good type of movie.  Secretariat inspires and even those against the horse racing industry would be hard pressed to prove that this horse dislikes running the races.  It seemed to revel in it.  The movie makers recreated the races well too, it seemed like actual horse races and had all the anticipation.  I really felt like I was right there cheering Secretariat on.  Despite all this activity though, there were some lulls in the movie that got kind of boring and that's what kept it from being a full five star movie.<br /><br />If you love horses this is a movie for you.  Its also a good family movie.  Enjoy and cheer on Secretariat!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011embellishments, but largely it seemed real.  And its a great story.

B004EPYZUI|3.0|What a strange movie.  I freely admit it, I got it, but I also didn't get it at the same time.  There were a lot of flashy action scenes and something I think was supposed to be substance, but overall I merely found it average.<br /><br />After the death of her mother, accidental murder of her sister (she was trying to save her from her father), Baby Doll finds herself in the mental institution.  Scheduled for lobotomy, she retreats and imagines herself in a brothel where dances are the key entertainment.  Every time she dances she retreats to a fantasy world where she (and later the other girls) have to fight different beings in order to achieve their objectives.  These visions help her to understand that if she obtains some key items, she'll be able to escape.  The other girls help  her along in her plan as they struggle against their oppressors.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Emily Browning: Baby Doll<br />Abbie Cornish: Sweet Pea<br />Jena Malone: Rocket<br />Vanessa Hudgens: Blondie<br />Jamie Chung: Amber<br />Carla Gugino: Vera Gorski<br />Oscar Isaac: Blue Jones<br />Jon Hamm: Doctor/High Roller<br />Scott Glen: Wise Man<br />Gerard Plunkett: Stepfather<br /><br />Let's face it, none of these characters were probably hired for their acting, but rather for their looks.  They did do a good job at what they did have to act at though.  In particular, Carla Gugino was very great as Vera Gorski.  At least, I liked her character the best as she was interesting.  Baby Doll I wasn't as fond of, while being slightly crazy, she seemed a little too wise for her character at times and it just wasn't realistic (yes I know, its a mental institution with delusions, but still).  The other girls probably would have been great, but it almost seemed like their roles were stifled in favor of Baby Doll's.<br /><br />The plot was a bit convoluted.  There was delusions within delusions and it could get somewhat confusing at times.  Honestly, I don't think this movie was aimed at me as a viewer base but rather teenage boys.  There was a lot of pretty girly type scenes and actions scenes with swords, guns, and monsters.  Despite this though, there was nothing really graphic or strong language used much so I would say that it definitely is ok for younger viewers.  I do have to comment that the special effects were done very well.  All of the scenes were great but I especially liked the scene where the monsters spewed steam instead of blood.  It was just a great effect and not gory as most are.  The music was pretty good too, all of it was haunting but it fit in with the movie very well.<br /><br />It was ok, but as said before, I don't think that it was aimed at me as a viewer group.  I'm sure other people would love it a lot more than I did.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011rly type scenes and actions scenes with swords, guns, and monsters.

B005D9MUWY|2.0|Once I had found out that Amazon was offering Swiftkey X as the free download of the day, I was excited. I remained like so until I noticed one quite annoying little 'bug'. The bug related to disrupting any search/word boxes (YouTube, Dolphin Browser and including both Amazon and Google Marketplaces). Uninstalling nor reinstalling didn't solve the problem so I'll be waiting...

B003YL4LYI|2.0|Warning, there are spoilers below.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy dance, bad. As upset as i was with the 5 year wait to get the second half of a mediocre book...i was really willing to give it a chance. I bought it the second it came out, brought my kindle with me everywhere so i could read it in my down time - paid close attention and picked up on little subtle things others might have missed - all this, and i was still disappointed.  (not in the Kindle tho, this thing is awesome, and no I'm not getting paid to say this.  It's perfect for someone who travels a lot for work).<br /><br />It really boils down to this - it doesn't feel like Martin enjoys writing about this world anymore. His behavior reinforces this feeling, too. It's like he's just bored of this world and has lost that energetic spark to create.<br /><br />Reading the first three books, it was like a man excited about the world he was building, excited about the stories, the characters, excited about what he was going to DO with them and he wanted to get there as smoothly and quickly as possible. Remember when Catelyn left for King's Landing in one chapter, and then arrived there next chapter? It's because the journey was unimportant - that stuff was filler - what happened to her IN King's Landing was important.<br /><br />Reading the last two, it was like he wasn't really sure what to do anymore, he couldn't figure out where he was going, he just had to fill up the pages with something, and he kept thinking back and forth on what to write. adding, deleting, adding, deleting - this is a worrisome sign when indecision, apathy, and indifference about a tale begin to rear their ugly head.<br /><br />It's this energetic drive when you have a story you want to tell.  But I didn't get that here from Martin, which is disappointing, because the man has genuine talent.  He just doesn't seem to be inspired enough to use it. I never got the impression of a clear vision. I didn't get a sense of his excitement for these characters. It shows up in a lot of ways - the tired cliches, the empty characterizations of the main viewpoints - it feels like Dance was a homework assignment to him, a very unwelcome homework assignment. \\"This one was a three bitches and a bastard\\", indeed it was, and that feeling comes across in his writing style.<br /><br />I really just feel he's bored and out of ideas. He's tired of Westeros, he isn't sure what to do anymore, and he's just stringing things along with random WTF moments thrown in to try and maintain our interest and fake excitement. It's similar to sudden loud sounds or 'GOTCHA' moments in bad scary movies; using cheap tricks to try and evoke a sense of fear when the plot itself can't.<br /><br />There are only a few moments where I get a sense of the old Martin. Reading Theon's chapters were interesting. Theon actually had an arc, an evolution, and you got the sense that George enjoyed telling this story. Too bad he had to ruin it with yet another cliffhanger ending. In fact, this was one of the few true cliffhangers in the book, in my opinion. The other 'cliffhangers' were never set up properly and are more like 'dangling threads' that came out of nowhere.<br /><br />We have Jon getting the Caesar treatment, Stannis marching on Winterfell, Theon and Jeyne escaping, Aegon landing in Westeros, the situation on the Wall, the Pink Letter... Too much buildup here with too little payoff!<br /><br />And then one of the big cliffhanger moments from the first book - Brienne - gets barely a mention in this! We are left to deduce what she most likely said and her agreement to lead Jaime to UnCat in return for her life - yet another plotline that goes nowhere. At the end of the book, effectively, nothing big or major has happened that we can see the result of. Dany is basically back where she started, realizing she should have gone to Westeros. The entire sideshow in Meereen has effectively accomplished nothing. A lot of interesting things happen to the characters that are ultimately irrelevant. The Others are still persona non grata, mentioned only in shadows. Dragons still haven't returned. Stannis hasn't really conquered anything meaningful. Tommen is still king. Dorne is still 'progressing'. The Ironborn are still the same. Not enough major action has happened.  I can accept one book of mostly filler, but two? A Dance with Dragons feels like it was written to meet a word count! What's next, he goes through and increases the font size on all the periods to add some more volume? He might as well, it'd be just as entertaining.<br /><br />The problem is, Martin could have easily given us at least one big climax in this book. You could have given us a Meereen showdown with results, you could have given us Jon's \\"death\\" and obvious rebirth as Azhor Az'hai or whatever, you could have given us the Others finally attacking in force, you could have given us Victarion or Tyrion meeting Dany, you could have given us the battle of Winterfell and the results - there are so many things he could have done that we don't get to see. He could have given us the first use of Dragons in war, and that would have fit right in the with the title. I don't mind cliffhangers, but really we should have gotten SOMETHING resolved in this book so it doesn't feel like a giant tease.<br /><br />The few redeeming moments for me - Selmy, Wyman's awesomeness (\\"So young\\" said Wyman Manderly. \\"Though mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey.\\"), \\"Would you like Freys with that\\", Theon - simply don't add enough to justify book for me.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading detailed prose, and seeing a world being built by a very skilled author, you might enjoy this.  If you're a huge fan of everything remotely to do with the world Martin has skillfully created, then you will find a lot here to fill in the blanks.  Unfortunately, most of those blanks were blank for a reason - we just didn't care.  I still don't.<br /><br />If you're a fan of an engaging, interesting plot - the sort of plot that we saw in the first three books - I'd give it a pass.<br /><br />PS: Martin may denounce us here at Amazon as trolls and sockpuppets, but I think that makes a mockery of the good rating system that has made Amazon so useful for people like me in the past.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Get this one, it works so well. Completely customized for you. It even tells you how many keystrokes youve saved. Mt4g unity.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had the original swift key and loved it. I love the new layouts on this one. I'm in love with the neon one. I've also have had no problem with it so far. Phone: Xperia Play
0062060554|1.0|This book reads like a rough draft before submitting for a plot approval. The writing is flat and insipid. The characters are devoid of palpable emotions, and they are altogether uninteresting.  It has no personality (Yes, the book). There is nothing worth contemplation after reading it. It fails to make much of an impression on me, a totally forgettable book.
B003Y5H542|4.0|I took my kids to see this film when it first came out. I was a little hesitant at first, especially after reading about the violence in the film. However, mine (8 and 13 years old) absolutely loved it. The story line is interesting and there were even small jokes hidden in there for us adults. The whole family loved it. I had to pick this one up on blu-ray right away when it came out.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|not as good as smartkeyboard pro   wow I should have waited. I bought. it yesterday. words words words fdff dddd
0525951652|5.0|I've already read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\", so I was expecting a lot from Follett in terms of character development.  I was not let down with \\"Fall of Giants\\", and I can hardly wait for the other two books of the trilogy.  Follett has a divine gift for storytelling and letting the reader in on the thoughts, motivations, ecstacies and disappointments of his characters.<br /><br />Plus, there's an interesting little cliffhanger involving \\"Robert\\" at the end, which of course is all the more intensified since the reader knows WWII lays in the future.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|The Social Network is an *extremely* fast-moving storyline focusing on the founder of facebook and how the phenomenon concerning the website got started. We find out the popular website didn't exactly appear on the internet on the friendliest of terms.     It turns out a lot of friction concerning Harvard grads were responsible for its creation, or rather... that's what makes up the storyline, resulting in one boardroom meeting after another. In fact, expect to see a neverending series of boardroom meetings that brings forward all the young college kids who believe they are the ones responsible for the creation of facebook, so from here, it's all about money issues and legal ownership of the website.     The Social Network isn't for everyone. Some might find it ludicrous sitting through a 2-hour movie on the subject of facebook. I won't disagree. However, to be fair, the movie writers made it so there's never any *really* dull moments. The need to keep the viewers attention must have been evident by the movie writers because they found a way to make it work, so they deserve a lot of credit for that.     Overall, patience is an obvious requirement, but besides that, if you can sit through a storyline dealing with the development of college computer geeks finding worldwide success with a website everyone still raves about to this very day, go for it.  I think it works but yeah, it's not for everyone.  Make sure you stay alert because if you don't, you WILL get lost.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|SwiftKey X seems to be tap only, not a slide or drag like Swipe or FlexT9. if you are used to these, SwiftKey will drive you nuts. FlexT9 is much better for me.
B005DIZ52C|5.0|This is a gritty, accurate portrayal of the notorious prisoner Charles Bronson. Great movie and very well acted and scripted. This is an excellent UNCUT DVD that comes with the terrific official soundtrack CD and a slick glossy slipcase. Can't beat this for the money
B004XJHBCE|2.0|Why would someone make a fake 1 star review?  Doesn't that seem like a waste of time?  It would be more beneficial for someone selling an app to make a bunch of fake 5 star reviews. I really don't see how this app does anything better than android does already on its own. the free app a day is what brought me here. this is my first app review and all I have to say is something fishy is going on with all these 5 star reviews. I've tried the app for 10-15 minutes and its nothing special. it lost my attention fairly fast because it looks boring. Ive downloaded other apps that were bad and never wrote bad reviews but someone is obviously trying to hype this app up so I'm trying to average it out because it doesn't do anything that deserves 5 stars.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've actually been using this alternative keyboard for months. I prefer the light theme. Don't pass this free app up!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I absolutely love this keyboard.  Great free app of the day Amazon!  There are several different types of replacement keyboards, this one falls under the predictive type.  One of the best.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Just got done reading this book. Usually I finish a book in 2-3 days. This took 2 weeks, because I kept falling asleep reading it. I wanted to put it down, but I don't like not finishing a book. If you can hang in there for 300 pages, you'll like the last 68 pages (even though you've guessed the ending).
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I purchased the FiiO E5 to use with my cell phone which has a very low output for the headset. Unit came charged so all I needed to do is plug in the earbud jack and the supplied wire going from the E5 to the phone. Sound is very good, no distortion. The  amplification is enough to hear in noisey surroundings. I would say the volume is about 70% louder than without the E5. Because the volume control is very small, I suggest that you use your device's volume control and leave the E5 near the max setting. Some minor hiss can be heard at the max setting when no audio is playing so I recommend turning the E5 volume down just until the hiss is gone. Plenty of amplification even at less than max. Also great for feeding weak output signals into car players or stereo systems. I have used it for 4 hours at a time and never had battery go dead. Not sure of maximum battery life on a single charge. Works as designed, inexpensive, tiny and powerful. What more could you ask for ?
1400052173|5.0|After reading this book, readers are certain to experience a wide array of emotions.  One may experience anger at the manner in which the Lacks family was exploited.  One may experience anger at the racism toward African-Americans in the South.  One may feel even more cold toward the medical community.  Regardless, readers will certainly walk away from this book feeeling that they learned something important.      The one criticism I may offer toward the work is that the scientific aspects sell short the importance of HeLa cells.  Skloot was likely aiming for an audience that may not have the strongest science background.  Those of us that do have stronger backgrounds would have loved to read more on the uses of HeLa cells and the aspects that make them immortal for example.    Skloot's thesis included giving Henrietta Lacks a face and a history.  By researching the woman, the exploitation of her cells, and her family history, Skloot accomplishes this task.  The research put the author in uncomfortable neighborhoods and situations.  However, Lacks never let feeling unwelcome stop her research, as she was quite persistent.  This may lead some readers to suggest the author inserts herself into the story too much.  While I would not necessarily argue, Skloot becomes part of the story in the present day.    Though the book is not a scholarly sceientific work, it is both entertaining and enlightening.  A good book should move a person, and it is hard not to be moved by this book in many ways.
0553801473|5.0|I was as frustrated as everyone else waiting the years for book five, but I have to say it was worth it! Characters I've missed have come back and the twists are fabulous!<br /><br />Worth the long wait, no matter what people say. (Plus the HBO series rocks)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Wow!  This keyboard works on the nook color running cm7.  I get a warning from them saying that i need the tablet optimized version.   Wish amazon would give me a choice.   If the wrong version is this good i'd love to see what the right version would be like
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I ordered this for my new AMD x6 processor.  It's a very nice CPU fan and is quiet.  It would be nice if it included the second fan for the heat sink but it's easy and cheap enough to buy another one.  I didn't not do this yet. It comes with the heat sink compound gel for installation which was nice.  The only problem I had was installing it took a little playing around with to figure out.  Instructions are just pictures without detailed descriptions on how to install.  After awhile I figured it out though and it's been working great for the last 3 weeks.  CPU is running cool and quietly.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using SwiftKey for almost a year and can't imagine not having it. Really learns from your typing patterns and speeds things up! Foreign language support is incredible too!
1594202842|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I love reading about other cultures and this was interesting how Chinese   children are raised.  The differents between an how American and Chinese child are raised was a shocker.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Fast paced, well acted, and revealed more about Ms. Plames' mission than the book.  The condition of the cd was verry good.  I wish it was longer.  I bought it \\"used\\" from Amazon.
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|This movie revolves around love, a universal subject. Terrific songs from Abba. My favourite song in the film is Our Last Summer. It's wonderful that Amanda's character has three potential fathers. Wonderful story, wonderful music, and wonderful actors/actresses, but it's not a 5-star film.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I personally love this movie it has everything in it! it had a story and a awesome ending! i really dont get why people dont like this??? it looks real, it has some interest in it, and if you dont get it then you are stupid. BUT! if you really dont get it just comment on this or whatever. the blu-ray was AMAZING in this movie! so i recommend... BUY THE DAMN MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard makes on screen typing less about pulling teeth and more about getting things done. The prediction and correction script is top notch. You could get by with typing only 1 or 2 letters for each word in a sentence, saving you time. The new neon theme is also beautiful. This app is a must.
B0042AGN7I|5.0|I love this movie, it is based on a true story and does a pretty good job telling the REAL story.  I finally bought it on BLue Ray.   Great sound, Great action, great visual.    What else can be said?
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|This is my second SEIKO - the first one lasted 35 years.  It went around the world with me - literally.    The new SEIKO is almost identical to my original Diver's Automatic Watch with a few exceptions.  The bezel on the new watch is unidirectional - my original was bidirectional and I kinda miss that - but I'm sure I'll adjust.  The new watch is rated to 200 meters - my original was rated to 150 meters - I never got below 130'.    There are a few cosmetic differences - ie the dial faces is slightly different and the second hand is a little different.  Not biggies.    I appreciate how rugged the SEIKO diver's watches are.  My original served me well through a variety of assignments and adventures and I hope this one does as well.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was looking for a better predictive keyboard recently and considered this one but passed because of the price. I got it for free but I will definitely be purchasing it for future Android devices.   Google+ came out a week ago but already it knows to append hangout after it. I don't know if it got this from my texts or the built in engine but it just shows how awesome it is.   Worth the full five stars, get this app!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love it. I have had it for about a year now and I would never go to any other keyboard. The more you type the more it learns your language and the faster and more efficient you can type.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Hours gone. Huge fun. Great for all ages. highly recommend. low tech but great break from the birds. good clean fun.
030726999X|2.0|The second and third books in this trilogy are not as good as the first one, perhaps because the first one introduces the wonderful character of Salander. Also, books two and three employ way too much telling and very little showing. Finally, I am prejudiced against omniscient POV and the book's POV is all over the place, even dipping into every mind present during a scene. Yikes. As successful as these books have been, the writing itself is rather amateurish.
0553801473|2.0|Many of the other critical reviews have covered the book's failings well, and I have but one thing to add:<br /><br />Most of this book is exactly the sort of exposition that would have been covered in a training montage if this were a movie: key bits of this excessive scenery could have been edited together to skip forward to the next bit of action.... but it wasn't.
B00337KM2S|2.0|*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*    I'm trying to decide if my disappointment in this movie is due to all the hype it got during its awards season, or if I would've disliked it as much anyway. It was entertaining enough and moved along quickly, but when the credits rolled, I was left confused about why it was so lauded.    I didn't like any of the characters in the movie. The main character, Ryan Bingham, is the most developed and the most tolerable, mostly thanks to a nuanced performance by George Clooney. But when the movie ventures into some cliched romantic comedy moments (complete with Bingham suddenly dropping everything in the middle of a lecture and going running through an airport to see his beloved) it gets a little hard to watch.    The two main female characters are both awful in different ways. Natalie, a book smart but naive hotshot fresh out of college, is hired to completely overhaul the workings of what seems like a successful, well-established company that she has no experience at, in a field she's never worked in. During their professional travels together, Natalie takes it upon herself to angrily lecture Bingham about his lifestyle choices, the gall that he displays by not wishing to get married and have children, as if she had never heard of such a thing. I found that to be annoying and rude. Who talks like that to a coworker? But of course, that talk leads to an epiphany for Bingham.    Natalie also makes a huge show of bawling into Bingham's arms in a hotel lobby because her boyfriend broke up with her. It was such a ridiculous and over-acted scene, obviously played that way for comic effect, but it just made her look even more green and unprofessional. I couldn't suspend my belief enough to accept that a kid like that would manage to get hired to do that job.     Alex, the other female lead, seems more promising until her big shocking secret that ruins everything is revealed near the end. As far as I know, there was nothing hinted at that madeus think she was anything other than an unattached, single woman, so that was disappointing. The writers could've kept her at least somewhat respectable by having her ultimately reject Bingham just because she wishes to not be committed to anyone, but instead she's just a manipulative woman cheating on her husband and lying to her family. Great.    The other negative is that the product placement of American Airlines and (to a lesser extent) Hertz was really distracting. It makes sense that a business would use a single airline and car rental company for its trips, but the extent to which the camera repeatedly lingers over the logos and slogans of American Airlines is too much. The characters also like to discuss all the perks they get from flying American Airlines. Sadly, all the product placement starts to make the movie feel like more of an American Airlines commercial than anything else.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It is better, and I really like the fact that it predicts stuff in up to three languages at once, so no need to switch between English and Spanish. Great implementation and heck, it's free today!  With that, I've just gotten so used to Swype that I can't go back to tapping... So that's the reason for the missing star.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Surely with your money and influence, George, you could find a copy of the original film negatives, scan them at 4K, remove the matte borders and artifacts, and clean up the picture where absolutely needed. Keep color correction, grain reduction and other enhancements to an absolute minimum (preferably none at all). While you're at it, find the original six channel soundtrack released in theaters (or the two channel... how about both?) and properly remaster it into a lossless surround format without \\"enhancing\\" it. I want to feel that magnificent brass theme rip my face off at the opening moment of the first film and hear the perfectly transparent string section soar during the beautiful final scene of Empire. I want to see the exact same movie that audiences were awed by in 1977. No more, no less.  And you know what? I would pay the price of this set many times over for it because they are that good.     Unfortunately this is not the movies we're getting here and not the set I will be purchasing. These are the Special Editions that contain a plethora of changes made by George many years after the movies were released. Among other things, they attempt to bridge the gap between the original trilogy and the hugely inferior prequel trilogy (made years later) by inserting garishly out-of-place special effects, additional scenes, replacement actors and the infamous Han Solo \\"kid-friendly\\" character change. Listen up, George: Only a lossless version of both the film and the soundtrack, taken from the highest-quality source material possible, can recreate the excitement of having seen these movies in a theater. Only then will you, George, have done justice to your amazing, epic films.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Lady Gaga, so I love this album as much as the others. There isn't one song on here that I don't like. I'm happy I got it when it was only 99 cents, too!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|just upgraded from SwiftKey to SwiftKey x. so easy to use.  I love that it learns what you type and predicts words for you.  Don't pass up this awesome free app of the day!
081095415X|5.0|The writings and the images of Africa are so powerful, so moving! How Nick captured these images without using a telephoto lens is just amazing, and on film! To think we humans are systematically eradicating these majestic animals from the face of the earth is more reason to own this pictorial book. Gone forever. BUY THIS BOOK, you will not be disappointed! I would have paid $100 for it! Thank you Nick, and Amazon for making it possible to possess these images.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I loved this movie. Matthew played the perfect lawyer. Trace Adkins played the PERFECT biker. The legal twists played right out of our headlines and have to say couldn't have been written any better.     As a 1L, my husband had to watch the movie by himself after we watched it because I explained to him the reasons the main character couldn't do such and such per the ABA rules of professional conduct.     Great movie. Glad we rented it! Glad we are buying it!
B004MNVKVO|5.0|One of the best rock albums recorded of all time!   Would loved to have been able to hear demo's of the songs or alternate versions or leftover songs from the sessions tho.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|Love Johnny Depp he is a great actor. But this movie is diffently a big let down. The funniest parts were the sneak peek previews of the movie. I didn't even finish the movie. Just turned the movie off. Waste of fifteen dollars.    Sorry I ordered it. I noticed the price has dropped since I preordered it. Hummm maybe it's not so great of a movie after all.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Im using the app right now to type this review.  The neon theme is my favorite and easy to use.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This book is extremely exciting.  It is a depressing book, but still good.  I am 10 years old and I loved this book.  At first I thought it would be very boring and long, but it turned out that it was very good.  Thinking of Count Olaf sends chills down my spine.
B000GY729M|5.0|I was already a big Killers fan when I first purchased this CD. I have to admit, the first time through it really didn't do a whole lot for me. But I listened to it again... and again, and again, and again. It takes some getting used to, but - boy - is it superb. I can say with no doubt it sits in my top 5 favorite albums of all time.<br /><br />I know the Killers took an awful lot of flak from critics when this album was released, but I just don't see it; I don't see it at all. Perhaps it was because it's not just another over-produced, auto-tuned, piece of useless tripe like most modern albums of the day? I don't know. But if it's perfect notes, cliched song movements, and elevator song lyrics you're looking for, leave it on the shelf. This is deep, this is all heart.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|No doubt about it. Prediction is accurate and you can type 2 languages at the same type with prediction without having to swap dictionary. They are both active at the same time. Again really accurate, compared to other keyboards I have tried before.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like the workouts presented here, especially that they're only about 20min long each.  To me, that's the whole point of this DVD, which brings me to the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars: there's about 7 or 8 minutes of promo stuff in the beginning that you cannot skip.  Literally, you can't skip to the menu to get past the ad (it's basically for the Biggest Loser TV show).  If you're like me, you don't want to waste your time watching that over and over again, so I just start the DVD playing while I do something else for awhile.  Every time I forget to queue it up, though, I'm irritated.  Pain in the butt.  The workout itself is a pain in the butt, too, though, which is great. =)
B0015DROBO|5.0|The first in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, proved to be a modern day murder-mystery thriller.  There was so much anticipation in waiting for something to happen that it kept me glued to the pages. It was a very believable story...like if it were taken from someone's journal and written into a novel. I really appreciated the main characters Lisbeth Salendar, talented researcher and ingenious computer hacker and Mikael Blomkvist, extraordinaire journalist: they made the narrative so electrifying. (You can read more details of this story from the thousands of reviews before me.)<br /><br />Dragon Tatoo was not the norm in my reading library, but I had to experience all the hype about the book. And I'm so glad I did because it was really an intense story. The writing isn't Pulitzer material (but what author's works are) but it is a mighty fine creation. It has a taste of everything in it-- investigating reporting, intellectual crime thriller, violence, racism, fascist groups, corrupt corporate climate, heinous government divisions, child abuse magnified, torture, sexual undertones and associations, and a melancholic story line. It intrigued my curiosity and quenched my desire for a phenomenal read! Highly recommend!...Now, on to the second book of the trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\".
B004XJHBCE|5.0|been using for a while and great app! works without bugs and has abundant amounts of skinning built right inside!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been very satisfied with this alarm. It's never failed to go off and the snooze is very accurate. I like the math features and the alarm crescendo. And it's free. And the ads aren't intrusive.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Here it is: your summer page turner for an afternoon by the pool. New author S.J. Watson places his main character, Christine, in a fascinating predicament: she wakes every morning with no memory of the past two decades of her life. Slowly, deftly, Watson weaves mystery into the narrative: is her husband Ben lying to her? Hiding events and people from her past? Why?<br /><br />Good pacing, and an interesting style shift from present tense narrative to journal entries. I didn't even realize I was reading a mystery at first; I thought I had picked up an exploration of memory as a foundation of identity. The mystery/thriller thread hooked me, and then kept me flipping pages late into the night. I thought I had guessed the end, and then was thoroughly, entertainingly surprised.<br /><br />Perhaps at the end, characters explain themselves a little too thoroughly, and the plot wraps up a bit too quickly and neatly. Ah well, I don't like ambiguity or pessimism in my summer reads!  For me, this book was exactly like a good summer movie; I might not remember much about it a few weeks from now, but what a great diversion on a long, hot, lazy afternoon.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have a Samsung Vibrant with Swype available, but I'll never switch back from SwiftKey. It's by far the fastest keyboard I've used. Worth $3.99, and you'd be just plain silly to not dl it free from Amazon.

1573228737|5.0|i'm a new sarah waters fan!  this is the 3rd of her novels that i read, in quick succession - the first 2 were THE LITTLE STRANGER and FINGERSMITH.  those were great too, but i would give them 4 stars (and i'm only doing 5-star reviews here).  for the record, i thought THE LITTLE STRANGER needed a little push to clarify the doctor's role in the hauntedness of the house... with the whole postwar class theme, i felt like it was kind of similar to ishiguro's REMAINS OF THE DAY but less successful, and with a not-quite-satisfying haunted-house motif tacked on... as for FINGERSMITH, i loved the first 100pp or so, up to the first head-exploding reversal - but then there were so many more subsequent reversals that it all ended up seeming, to me, a bit over-the-top.  (this was probably waters's intention - and it's a fun read - but personally, i could have done with a tiny bit less head-exploding.)  AFFINITY was my favorite of these 3 books: it has the whole \\"was it supernatural?\\" thing going on, like THE LITTLE STRANGER - except that there's a more coherent answer (with maybe just a bit of lingering uncertainty); it has crazy plotting and reversal like FINGERSMITH (shares also FINGERSMITH's *incredible* portrayal of physical longing and the passage of small periods of time (like, the 2-3 week range)) - but it's concentrated into one big reversal at the end.
0553106635|5.0|I always hope that the books I purchase are in good condition, and for the third time amazon has come through with a perfect grade. For the book, well I just started A Feast of Crows and I can surely say this one, A Storm of Swords, is by far the best book of the series... gotta continue reading!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard blows away every other keyboard I have ever used. It's intuition is flawless. I would have paid for it had I known it was this good... which is a flaw within the purchasing options (Market, App Store, etc.).. we should have more time to review an app to decide whether or not to return.. Either way, thanks SwiftKey!! Your app rocks!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I really feel for George. I don't think his heart is in this series anymore...He goes through the motions and uses his prodigious writing chops to create richly detailed environments and atmosphere, but the story itself just isn't there.<br /><br />Some say that might be the theme of the novel...the characters themselves are frustrated with their desire to get somewhere and the stagnation they endure. However, it reads to me like an unintentional metaphor about how George feels about the series as a whole. He knows where he wants to end up, but he is frustrated in the details and the timeline on how to get there.<br /><br />...and I get a sense that George is just weary. Weary of this world, weary of these characters, weary of the whole damn project but no one will let him set the whole damn thing aside.<br /><br />I understand, and after slogging through this novel, my anger abates. I don't have the burning NEED to have cliffhanger questions answered that I did at the end of book four. I give thanks for the tour through Westeros, the OMFG moments with Reek and Davos for very, VERY different reasons, the chance to actually SEE Barristan the Bold live up to his name. I'll even give thanks for the food and urination descriptions. I am disappointed but I can now put this series aside until the time comes when or if this series comes to an end.<br /><br />Thank you for your effort. I'm sorry I wasn't satisfied but it's bittersweet that I no longer consider myself a \\"rabid\\" fan. 43 years old is a bit too old to be \\"rabid\\" about anything.
B004G6009U|5.0|Thanks a bunch.. Everything went great... I love the DVD and blu-ray combo.. I love the  Movie.... : )
0307716511|2.0|With all the advance publicity for this book....and the stellar reviews, I was thrilled to see this offered through Amazon Vine. I started reading it soon after it arrived in the mail. The book started so well I was tempted to steal time from work to read it. As it was I read lunch time and breaks. The book was going well for me  .... Until the end.  Rather than a \\"Sixth Sense\\" sort of surprise I felt it was more of a \\"Bobby Ewing in the shower\\" moment. I felt totally duped. What???? Oh well. At least I didn't have to pay hard-earned money for it.
B00386EZJU|5.0|you will love this soundtrack!  evokes all the feeling from the movie--and you can hear all the subtle nuances you can't hear with a soundtrack attached to its film!
0385341008|5.0|I can't suggest that this book was anything other than a predictable love story (I mean come on, we all knew that Juliet and Dawsey were going to get together in the end, and we all knew that it would take the whole book to get there) written in an unusual style (series of letters between the characters).... and yet it was the backdrop, the back STORY, the setting, and the characters that makes this a wonderful book. I freely admit to being a sentimental sap, I'll cry over episodes of favorite television shows that I've seen dozens of times. My wife thought there was something seriously wrong with me when we went and saw The Lord of the Rings and I literally sobbed (to my credit I wasn't the only one...). This book did the same thing to me. I teared up at least a dozen times, so much so that I thought maybe it had something to do with cold medication I was taking. So I took a nap, and came back later to finish it. No. It really is a wonderful story that tells a much more important story. The Nazi occupation of the Guernsey Islands is just one more story of a brutal occupation by ordinary men (some good and some bad). Enough has been written and said about the evils of that regime, that I need not repeat it... and yet I am always surprised anew each time I am exposed to it. An easy read and highly recommended.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This soundtrack is AMAZING!!  It makes you want to move and to sing--whether either is possible or not!  Christina's voice is incredible and there are two songs from Cher on the soundtrack making it even better!  This CD is a ton of fun!

B0053YEM7U|4.0|Like many others, I wasn't expecting much from this release, but it's very good.  With Trevor Horn producing and Geoff Downes on keyboards, you might expect it to sound a lot like Drama from 1980, but it doesn't.  I think the main reason is Steve Howe.  On Drama it seemed like they were trying to be a metal group at times, but there's a lot of acoustic guitar on Fly From Here and a different style of playing entirely.    The title track should appeal to you if you liked Close To The Edge.  I like that each section works pretty well on it's own, but it sounds like a complete suite when they are played together.  The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be is a beautiful ballad from Chris Squire.  Hour of Need is almost a folk song and features a great acoustic performance from Howe, along with the instrumental Solitaire.  Into The Storm is the hardest rocker.    There are a couple of missteps - Bumpy Ride is cheesy and Life On A Film Set sounds like a mediocre ELP song, with lots of overly dramatic flourishes and pauses.  I do miss Jon Anderson's vocals, but Benoit David does a good job making this his own and sounds nicer than Trevor.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am using this on my Motorola Droid and my Samsung Galaxy Tab. It says it's not optimized for tablets, but being only a 7&quot; screen, it works perfectly. This is much better than the defaults, the Samsung keyboard and Swype. Glad it was the free app of the day!

B004WCTLNY|4.0|In the bleakest moment of upstart New York senator David Norris's political career, he meets free-spirited dancer Elise Sellas and never mind that he meets her in the men's room as he goes over his concession speech. Their flirty chance encounter so inspires David that his concession speech goes on to electrify the crowd and firmly plants him as a frontrunner for the next election. Mysterious are the workings of fate, that unknowable shaper of things that has decreed that this would be David and Elise's sole encounter. But then fate takes an inadvertent nap.<br /><br />Taking the bus one day, David bumps into Elise again, and this time he's not willing to let go. And this is where fate manifests in the shape of the Adjustment Bureau, comprised of ordinary-looking men clad in trenchcoats and fedoras but demonstrating the uncanny knack for freezing time and folding geography. These strange Adjusters align themselves against David Norris, conspire against his pursuit of Elise. And there's just something quite cool and very Greek mythology about a guy who is so undeterred and would fight fate itself to be with the one he loves. But you can't discount how chilling the Adjustment Bureau's top agent Thompson (Terence Stamp) sounds when he tells our smitten, defiant congressman: \\"When you look back at all this, David, just remember - we tried to reason with you.\\"<br /><br />In a way, it's comforting to know that there IS a plan. Now I don't have to fret about free will and all that jazz and worry that I chose the wrong pair of socks to wear on a given day. Those socks were simply destined to be worn! It's cute how the story tries to be subtle with its referencing of the Almighty Dude and his assortment of guardian angels, preferring to instead trot out its \\"agents of fate\\" who - in the midst of ensuring that \\"the Plan\\" stays on course - would occasionally speak in awed tones of someone called \\"the Chairman.\\" Thankfully, in terms of sensibility, the narrative stays more within the borders of the sci-fi thriller, instead of straying too far into the divine.<br /><br />Maybe Matt Damon signed onboard this film partly because his pal Ben Affleck had already done a film adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short story (\\"Paycheck\\"). ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is based on Philip K. Dick's 1954 short story \\"Adjustment Team.\\" But whatever the motivation, Damon excels in his role of David Norris, does well with the romantic lead bits and, of course, the action hero bits. His very real chemistry with Emily Blunt (who is simply perfect here) sells their characters' immediate attraction to each other. More than anything else, the romance is the driving force of the story. You get invested in what happens to David and Elise, and you pull for David to find a way to stump the Adjustment Bureau, to avoid their recalibration or resetting or whatever it is that they do to you when you get too uppity and challenge fate.<br /><br />Themes such as predestination and free will are raised, and David Norris must wrestle with two choices, one which will benefit the greater good and the other which preserves his personal happiness. There's even this added dramatic tension in that the Adjustment Bureau is working for the betterment of mankind. As Thompson informs our hero: \\"David, you can change the world. But that doesn't happen if you stay with her.\\" Although, conversely, there's a line of thought which sees the Bureau as these mindless, unquestioning drones. But it's not all angsty navel-gazing. There are some snappy chase scenes, bolstered by some slick special effects. You have to like the seamless visual transitions as the Adjusters navigate supernaturally thru the city by way of these doors that - once activated by the agents' hats - open to other places. And you have to really like it when David gets a hold of one of these hats.<br /><br />No deep sense of spirituality here or profound reflections on theology, and that's fine. The film was promoted as a romantic sci-fithriller and I liked that it stuck to its guns. I like that the story earns its emotional moments. David's search for Elise spans years. Three years alone elapse with David every day taking the same bus going down the same route on the slim chance that Elise will one day get onboard (she doesn't). Emily Blunt is so appealing and so sexy that I sort of drowned in her performance. And you couldn't tell at all that she actually isn't a professional dancer; she's so good. You can see why she inspires David to fight for her in epic fashion. To hell with causality. Damn the ripples.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus material: Audio Commentary by writer/director George Nolfi; 6 Deleted/Extended Scenes (totaling 00:07:01 minutes long); \\"Leaping Through New York\\" - about shooting on location in New York city and marrying that with CG to deliver those magical door transitions (00:07:37 minutes); \\"Destined to Be\\" - Damon and Blunt talk about their characters' romance versus fate (00:04:52); and \\"Becoming Elise\\" - Emily Blunt's rigorous dance regimen to transform herself into a dancer (00:07:07).thriller and I liked that it stuck to its guns.

B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I have occasionally enjoyed Tina Fey as she did her Saturday Night Live gig as a news anchor. But I guess for me she's a one-trick pony. I was disappointed in her book which seemed like a scattered reminiscing between friends --of which I was not a part of the group. He comments on SNL and 30 Rock offered a little interesting tidbit or two, but nothing that I felt was important. Her views on men versus women in writing left me annoyed --I don't mind seeing differences pointed out so long as the observer is objective and I don't think Tina was. I ended up putting the book aside after making it through 3/4 of it. I just wasn't interested in reading more.<br /><br />There's no question that Tina Fey is a recognizable part of today's media and that she has a talent and camera presence that's undeniable. But my opinion is that she stay within the media she's suited to, and I have to say I don't think writing is it. No one will ever do a better Sarah Palin impersonation, but that doesn't mean that being good at one thing makes one good in another. I'm not a 30 Rock fan and perhaps that's why I'm taking the negative side of things, but all in all I didn't think the book was worth the price I paid for it; had it not been a Kindle edition, I would have given the book away to someone caught up in Fey Fandom.
B004OT2UCO|5.0|What a great kit. It's larger than it looks in the pictures. You can get an idea of the scale when you compare the model to the minifigs in the box picture. The detail and design are a vast improvement over the previous kits. The minifigs are one of a kind and a welcome addition to our collection. Playability is limited with this kit. The pod racers are on stands and are a bit wobbly when the six year old flys them around the house. They come apart once in a while too. I would recommend this for a display kit rather than a play kit (the xwing is more playable, for example)<br /><br />Shop around for the best price. Check Lego online shop for true market value.

B004BSFSTA|2.0|High Highs, Low Lows, great sound. I expected nothing less when buying an audio product with the Marshall logo emblazoned on it.<br /><br />Great features:<br />- Spiral cord, so you dont have to worry about hitting the end of the cord, and ripping the cord or port out of your device.<br />- Reinforced plug. The plug has a golden spring wrapped around the end of it, so you shouldnt have to worry about it bending, and damaging the wires inside the cord.<br />- COMFORT - great cushy headphones that I can wear for hours without my ears hurting (unless you crank those babies to 11!)<br /><br />Here's the edit, a few months later:<br /><br />-Broken. These have done nothing but be used while at my desk at work, and a few weeks agoI notices the black part holding the headband to the ear cup had become cracked and broken.<br />Today, it completely gave loose, and is destroyed, with no way to fix it. I'm a Marshall Amp user, and Im really disappointed with the quality of these headphones. They sound so great, and are so comfortable, it pains me to complain that they as are just now unusable and unfixable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't even tell how much I loved this book and the entire trilogy.  Page turner for sure, I had my doubts when a co-worker recommended this series, but I was sold immediately.

0763644765|5.0|I really love this sweet book.  We first checked it out from our local library on a whim, but my daughter (almost two) liked it so much that we went ahead and bought it.  Besides the fact that my daughter likes it so much, I love this book for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. It shows just the right amount<br />Some potty books just go too far in how much of the body they show and it's just awkward to me.  Then there are other potty books on the other end of the spectrum that have kids wearing underwear while they're sitting on the potty.  Not helpful when you're trying to teach a little one how to use the potty.  This book shows just enough to be helpful and instructive, but there are no awkward moments in pointing things out on the little kid in the book.  And because it doesn't show any private parts, it's great both boys and girls!<br /><br />2. The story is funny and true to life<br />Both my daughter and I love all the funny faces the kid in the book makes.  She'll copy the faces all the time and it cracks us up.  She also thinks it's funny when the kid forgets to take off his diaper before he sits on the potty.  I think, even though it's just something silly, it's also something she can really relate to and understand.<br /><br />3. The artwork is charming<br />The illustrations are simply charming.  They have lots of great color and they're easy for my daughter to understand.<br /><br />4. It's really engaging<br />We've checked out several potty books from the library for my daughter who's almost two.  She's shown interest in a lot of the books, but not for as long or as much as this book.  It's truly made her excited to use the potty and wear panties.  Half the time I think she just wants to try and go on the potty so she can read this book.<br /><br />Hopefully this is helpful if you're looking at buying it online and haven't been able to flip through it before.  We love it!

Do I need to download where there's free wifi?  (If so, I'll have to crack out the instruction manual!)    Next question---I already own Swiftkey.  Is that why I am getting this message on my phone \\"1 App to Update\\" rather than \\"1 App to install\\"?    Gotta say i LOVE LOVE LOVE Swiftkey and I am very excited to give Swiftkey X a try (if I can just get it installed!)
B003EVWDR0|2.0|Alright, I'll give this movie what it deserves--kudos for excellent visuals, edge-of-your-seat action, suspense-filled drama, and even a good amount of comic relief. Yes, this movie was entertaining to watch. It was no doubt a visual feast. Probably not many people would deny that.     However, as many have already mentioned, this is basically a tree-hugger movie. Obviously Cameron is using it to advance some kind of \\"Incovenient Truth\\"-like political agenda. The plot of this movie makes the humans and their technology look like the obvious bad guys, when the native Nav'i were just as much at fault for everything that happened. THEY were the ones with the superiority complex, they were the ones who refused to simply move elsewhere on the planet (mind you there was PLENTY of room for everyone, both human and Nav'i). I mean come on, the humans were just doing their jobs. The company's job was to get as much unobtanium or whatever it was as they could, so that they could pay their employees and said employees could support their families, and so they could serve their own kind as best they can. Oh and HELLO, who spent millions of dollars creating Nav'i Avatars so that they could get a better understanding of the natives? The answer to that should be obvious. The point here is that the humans put all kinds of effort into trying to understand the Nav'i so that they could negotiate a peaceful, mutually beneficial relationship, yet the Nav'i are totally ungrateful and refuse to try to see things from the humans' point of view. Their selfish pride refuses to even CONSIDER the benefits the humans might be able to bring them, automatically assuming that the other race doesn't have anything they could benefit from, when they really don't even know the first thing about human civilization. They are selfish, arrogant and foolish. It's funny how the less you actually know the more you THINK you know? Weird how THAT works, huh. Oh, and then they sent thousands of their own peopleto their deaths over some stupid tree. Sounds like someone's priorities need rearranging.    Don't get me wrong, violence in an action movie is essential, obviously, but when that violence is not really necessary, that's when it becomes irritating. And what's even worse, the humans lose and are forced to leave. I'm failing to see how that's fair. If Cameron wanted to make the humans out to be the villains and the Nav'i the victims, he should have had the humans simply attacking the Nav'i and killing them by the thousands without even trying to understand them or negotiate with them first. And then the Nav'i should have been the ones putting significant effort into making peace with the humans and only resorting to violence when it became absolutely necessary.    Overall, this movie was entertaining but in the end it left me feeling kind of disturbed rather than entertained. Is this what people really think? Do we really like the idea that technology, military, and corporations are all bad, and that the solution to all our problems is becoming one with nature and worshiping it like a god? Or are we just all extremely shallow people who just like movies for whatever sensory stimuli they provide?    You want to watch a sci-fi flick with good story AND good visuals? Watch TRON: Legacy.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm a serial fad dieter and go through stages of exercising and then not. I'm 24 and know im not actually overweight at 8.7stone for my 5'2 frame but ive been tiny all my life (mostly around 7.7 stone) and didnt feel comfortable after not being able to fit into my 6-8 clothes anymore.  I have never tried a work out DVD before and didnt really have much hope for it, HOWEVER this DVD has totally changed my mind. I absolutely love it! I get bored so easily and am not motivated at all to spend hours at the gym so being able to do this for 20 mins is perfect.  I love the three different levels. Level one i found a bit too easy- although I was always sweating bt the end. I completed this level without any days off and did ache for the first 4 days (so it must have been working me harder than i thought)  I also cycle to work and back (about 20mins a day) and like to go cycling with my other half at weekends across the south downs, so i was doing a bit of extra exercise.  Level two is much harder, it killed me the whole way through the 10 days. I have to admit, out of all the levels this is the one i liked the least. I took several days here and there off due to my social life getting in the way but eventually completed the 2nd level two days ago.  Level three is my favourite. It works you hard, dont get me wrong, but personally i prefer level 3 to level 2. it seems more interesting in some way.  to date, i have lost half a stone! my arms, legs, tummy and back are all noticebly much more toaned and im fitting back into my clothes!!  I feel allot fitter and will carry on to mix up the levels after the 30 days are completed. I would definitely recommed to anyone with a busy lifestyle who wants to see results fast! Well Done Jillian.

0452286751|5.0|Being an original thinker, I can relate to Howard Roark in a lot of ways; for one, I was asked to transfer departments when new management was hired, wanting nothing more than obsequious yes-men at their disposal. Myself notwithstanding, modern society as a whole should be able to relate to this in many ways.    Throughout the book, the architecture community, and the Banner readers gradually come to hold Ellsworth Toohey--the principal antagonist--in high esteem.  Conversely, an individualist such as Roark is principally concerned with his own visions, rather than the opinions of others.  Fast forward to the present day, and we are becoming a society more concerned with public opinions than ever.  For example, a website such as Yelp has magnified the voice of the general public; consequently, many of my friends will refuse to eat at a restaurant that doesn't have 'at least four stars.'      While many of aspects of the book are flawed, it is still well worth the rather extensive read; despite its length, the story progresses quite fluidly.

B000E8NRR6|5.0|Granted this may not be as stylistically diverse as older Steely Dan albums, although I love this album. What blows me away is the purity of the sound quality. You need one of two things to enjoy this thoroughly- either a high end set of loudspeakers, may I suggest Klipsch Cornwalls or modified pair of Realistic Mach One/Two Series- the highs are crystal clear, and lows are so clear and extremely deep-ended. Vintage Stereo equipment will illustrate this album far better than today's run of the mill retailed audio.<br />If you like rock-jazz, this album is for you. Hat's off to Donald Fagen, today's 'King of Cool'...<br />But follow the advice on DVD-A players vs DVD-V players discussed here in the review section.<br />If you use a DVD-V player, stick with the Audio CD release or LP of this recording.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I thought SwiftKey couldn't get better, well,I was WRONG! Better than anything out there....PERIOD! I am spoon happy that it's Finally (back) on Amazon!
0756659841|5.0|I got this for my 4 year old son on a plane ride we were taking.  It has so many stickers and kept him entertained for long periods of time.  It was fun to do with him and he loved that it so many of the different lego characters in it.  Very fun and the stickers were reusable in the book. That was great for when he changed his mind!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Wow, great keyboard. Nice wide keys so no more feeling like I need to be a sniper with my thumbs. Nice color themes out of the box.  I've been using better keyboard 8 since day one and this showed up on the marketplace today. Installed it and it's instantly better. Word prediction is spooky and it even remembers the order of words you've typed from previous entries. For instance I'm using Handcent as a message app and sometimes it'll crash right in the middle of a long message. Now with swift keyboard I type in the first word of the original message and it 'suggests' the next word I used, so I just keep tapping the suggested words and it rebuilds my sentances for me.  Can almost be too predictive though. Sometimes the spacebar will insert a word without me catching it. I'm pretty sure I can disable that tho.  I'm bummed I gave Better Keyboard my money and not these guys. Easily worth 5$ but free is almost too good.
B00004YTIQ|4.0|I bought this to fit over my backyard blow up pool that is approximately 118\\" x 70\\". [[ASIN:B000058TJ3 Intex Swim Center Family Pool (Colors and Styles May Vary)]] It stays securely on unless we have a lot of wind. I have not added the ropes since I have not needed them yet.  If it's calling for a big storm I do one of 2 things. 1--Get the cover wet and it sticks great to the pool. 2--I just take it off until the storm has passed.  If the pool isn't near any trees, then shouldn't be too much debri that gets it in. Nothing a little strainer can't get out.  Love having this cover. It helps to warm the water in the pool as well as keeps it clean.  Before it would only be a day or 2 and it was starting to get gross. Now, we can go all week with crystal clear water. Best part is no bugs, leaves, grass, etc get in. I had no idea how often the birds were pooping in the pool until we got the cover and daily there is bird poop on it.  Yuck! So happy with my cover.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I like this keyboard only thing is the letters are a bit small,  but other then that it's pretty awesome.  free so don't pass on it.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this to 1) transfer photos from my camera and 2) to transfer photos from my PC. Both work but you need to understand the SD drive format. When using your PC, you must load the images in the same location as it would be from a camera, namely /DCIM/<camera name>/ . I tried various different formats but couldn't get the iPad to see the photos unless it was in this format.  Works great and I thought it was good value. Now I can offload photos to my iPad and review them on a much bigger screen.
B00005JMAH|4.0|HP3 was the last of my favorites. After this, the Harry Potter series kinda went downhill for. This one is darker and different than the previous two movies. An escaped convict named Sirius Black breaks out of Azkaban and tries to find Harry. Black is believed to be a supporter of Voldemort. During his 3rd year at Hogwarts, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin teaches him the Patronus charm to defend him against the Demeontors; the guards of Azkaban searching for Black. With the help of Ron, Hermione, and time-travel; Harry will come face-to-face with the man who betrayed his parents. I would recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!!!
0553801473|2.0|I see the consensus 3 stars this book has received (as of July 21) and I can understand where that comes from.  However, it seems to me that the 5 star reviewers are basing their reviews on the series and the investments they've made in these books (the people with fan websites come to mind) and not this book.<br /><br />As others have noted, this book is filled with never ending descriptions of marching, sailing, food being eaten and the characters just walking around rehashing meaningless events through inner monologues that repeat the same phrases over and over.  If you remove these distractions from the book, you come to an unfortunate realization:  there is no story here.<br /><br />Every good story needs a good villain.  Unfortunately, Martin killed all the good villains in previous books and is now trying desperately to create new ones.  Not only has Martin killed almost all of the \\"good\\" characters (Ned, Rob (and everyone who was with him or near him), Robert Baratheon, the Viper, etc.) or stopped writing about them (the Hound, Gregor Clegaine, Bronn, Catelyn, Sansa, etc.), he's killed Joffrey and Tywin, who were the only meaningful villains and at least brought you into the story emotionally.  Jaime is conflicted and isn't a villain anymore.  Cersei is used up and not frightening anymore.  Who are we supposed to hate now?  Some minor character from the North who is clearly just an afterthought when Martin remembered he'd killed everyone who mattered?  Add this to Martin's alarming tendency to maim each and every character he doesn't kill (John's burnt hand, Jaime's lost hand, Davos' fingers, Bran's spine, Tyrion's nose, Reek's fingers, the myriad tongues ripped out, feet chopped off, fingers bitten off, etc.) and the raping and burning that Martin describes ad nauseum and you're left with a book with tremendous misery and little joy.<br /><br />This book also continues the appalling tendency of Mr. Martin to subject young women in his books to objectification, rape, and despair in salacious detail, which is disturbing to say the least.<br /><br />I was disappointed with this book and I likely won't read the next (if we all live that long).  My last hope was that Danaerys would continue to develop as a strong lead character in this book, but Martin dashed that hope.  She went from growing into a queen to being totally inept at ruling her people.  She becomes a love-struck silly girl, and to top it all off, Martin provides only about 4 pages total of Danaerys in the presence of her dragons.  Given how little the dragons were in the book and how clearly they were neglected by Danaerys, this book has the wrong title.  To give some contrast, there are about 50 pages of descriptions of food in this book.  I can tell you more about what the characters ate than what the dragons are like.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this thing. Its prediction is awesome and I love the different themes. :D<br /><br />It is working perfectly on my samsung vibrant with gingerbread.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey for months and love it (G2 with a &quot;real&quot; kb) .  X seems even better,  and I will definitely buy it for my next phone.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I was excited to see this apps use, but once I saw they collect my credit card information and store it all I uninstalled. Come back to me with a product that doesn't pillage my information.
B001NW8D7G|5.0|This is a very good value for your money. Especialy nowadays. It looks like there is trend for (partialy) return of the vinyl record. All in all I'm very glad that I purchased this record.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is Great and no headphones are needed for antenna like I need for my EVO radio. I would absolutely recommend!
B004ZZS4CC|2.0|While the story of the horrific events that Jaycee Dugard had to endure is quite compelling the writting style leaves much to be desired. Dugard writes in very basic sentences with little sentence variety giving it a childish quality at times. Many details are repeated over and over almost verbatim. This made it very boring to read. I forced myself to finish reading out of curiosity. I wanted to know about her reunion with her family. This too was disappointing.
0553801473|3.0|Finally its here yea then I read it boo boring and what is this thing with killing off major characters. My favorite one I might add. having this book continue this series is better than not having it but I hope we don't have to wait six years for some more action.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The best thing about the free ape of the most day is the idiot reviews.   Seriously, it is a keyboard ape.. How do you morons think it could work if it couldn't see what you type into it!
B004W48QFG|1.0|Just use teamviewer app..its free. No point of getting this app for 25 bucks. Save your money on this economy
0061784788|2.0|I should have loved this book;  I liked the locations, liked the Native American angle, but it contained glaring factual errors; for instance; twice Rollins called the founder of the Mormon Church John Smith instead of Joseph Smith. All the brief romantic interludes were silly; did anyone really care about the tender interlude betwen Ashanda and Rafael--two villians with hearts of gold? They had only been responsible for breaking the neck of a child and for the deaths of dozens of \\"good guys\\" a few pages earlier...but they loved each other in the end.... Wow! The whole book was silly, too pumped up--an adventure on steroids.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Came across this app due to the free app of the day page. After reading a few reviews, decided the worse thing that happens is I don't like it and uninstall it.    After sending a few text messages, I have come to the conclusion, I would pay for this app if I hadn't gotten it for free during this promotion. It works like a dream, \\"predicting\\" my next word correctly every time and saves me from the frustration I felt typing on my previous keyboard and hitting four different keys that wasn't the one I aimed to click.    It was a breeze to set up and is a very user friendly app to navigate.    I strongly encourage you to get this app during the free promotion. Because, the worst case scenario is, you don't agree with me, and you simply uninstall it from your phone.    But, if you come across my review after this promotion is over and are debating whether or not a keyboard app is for $3.99. This one is.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game I can't believe something so simple can be  so addictive good brain game.got it for free do made it super deal
B00402FGE4|4.0|Stargate Universe has a fine cast and fine acting.  The first season portrays the blowup of a planet and the hurried departure of an ancient starship from said planet with scientists and visitors aboard, and the troubles attendant on the Destiny because it has apparently been travelling a long time without any crew and therefore without any maintenance. Various solutions are found but there are also conflicts among the people aboard, since some are scientists, some military and some just folks.  It is a good beginning to the four-season journey.<br />Linda Sheean
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Awesome keyboard the predictions are great,  if it was faster when typing I would use it over the gingerbread keyboard.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Couldn't wait for this keyboard to come back to Amazon. I used the beta from day 1 and was hooked. Best keyboard out there. Just wish the space bar was a little longer.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using the beta version of this for a while and loved it so when it was offered for free I was extremely happy! Thanks Amazon!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a great keyboard that I really enjoy using. The landscape mode that splits the keyboard is very useful and the predictions are pretty good. It even remembers the word order you're most apt to use. And I love the black skin. The neon and white are kind of lame IMO but he black is sweet! And the symbol keys being accessible by a long hold is perfect, so convenient! I only wish I had waited a couple of days to get this for free on Amazon... But it's all good. I'd forgotten to download the amazon appstore on my tablet... But that was remedies. Anyway, get this app, be it free or $4 it's worth it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using this app for about two years now and I love it.  It was worth the every penny.  It can learn from your messages and the predictions are very good.   Get it today while it's free.  If you don't like it nothing lost.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|One suggestion would be to have more than 3 options to select from the predictive list - something akin to a.i.type. heuristic axioms would be good too. K, maybe that's a little too nerdy. Heh
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best error correcting keyboard. Doesn't seem to drain battery like swype does. It would be nice if it had swiping funconality in addition to typing like the new htc keyboard but fantastic nonetheless.
0307463745|4.0|An inspirational book for those who have ever considered entrepreneurship or who currently own or work for an SME.    At first it felt too inspirational with little substance.  It felt too... Seth Godin.  A good read, but ultimately pointless and substance-less. Inspirational for the sake of being inspirational and not offering tips that are practical enough to produce sustainable, long-term changes or thoughts.    But then I continued reading.    This is good!    The book suddenly changed into an inspirational book with actionable suggestions. It discusses peer-reviewed studies that you can implement to become more creative.  Offers real, practical advice on starting something on your own or making something that you are currently a part of work better than ever.    Worth it.  Each chapter is a page or two long. A quick read: one or two sittings.    (Disclosure: I received a free copy from the author.)
B0058VW36U|5.0|Tired of Angry Birds? Try this one. Great physic game that is simple to learn, addictive, and in my (very) humble opinion even better than Angry Birds.
0375704027|4.0|\\"Life doesn't require ideals. It requires standards of action.\\"    An ever quotable book, as relevant now as it was in the 80s.    \\"If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.\\"    This is the book where the classic Forrest Gump 'box of chocolates' quote came from.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I am not here to whine or complain about how much I hate the Special Editions.  For the Star Wars fans that prefer those versions, you will soon have them in HD quality on Blu Ray.  Unfortunately for the rest of us, we have still not received OUR preferred versions in a QUALITY format (And no, the 2006 DVD's do NOT cut it).    Let Mr. Lucas know that we want the theatrical versions on Blu Ray by posting your own review of the Star Wars Original Trilogy.
0375507256|4.0|A very novel way of presenting a book: five stories all connected in some way; some subtle, some not so subtle.  Worthwhile read, but I wasn't a huge fan of the first and second stories and it was definitely a touch too long.    Not quite a full 4/5 but definitely more than 3/5.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Glad I picked this game up. I am such enjoying mixing all the combos. I am pretty lame and stuck at about 50....but will keep trying. I would recommend this game.
0061353248|5.0|The best introduction to behavioural economics you will ever read.  Some of the studies contained within have been analysed to death in countless books, but this was the original, written by the researcher of most of the studies.    Occasionally funny, always thought-provoking.    I would give it 4.5 as it's not perfect (I would have loved it to have been a bit longer), but it definitely deserves 5 stars more than 4 as it offers actionable tips on becoming more 'predictably irrational' and helps you understand why you react to certain situations in certain ways.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|And it's a doozy! Swiftkey is easily one of the best productivity apps available on Android. The new \\"X\\" version does improve on the old version. Better prediction and better style. If only the Tablet version was free too. I bought this a long time ago, but it is definitely worth the price of admission for those who text alot. Highly recommended.
0143117009|4.0|Collapse is too vast to review.  The topics covered, the ideas presented and the facts Diamond lays bare are so vast and overwhelming that not only did the book take me a long time to read, it took me completely by surprise.    Definitely recommended reading if you're interested in sustainability, anthropology, history or futurism.  It's got it all, and it's scientific as hell.    His Pulitzer prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel, next.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|This book is downright boring. I understand the premise, and it looked interesting. But it ended up being extremely reptitive and uninteresting. If I had to hear about her journal one more time I would have thrown my Kindle out the window.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this is by far one of my favorite qwerty keyboard Apps. It accurately types my letters,  which is a first for me,  alsoI love the neon theme.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used the original SwiftKey since I got my evo. It was a great keyboard. Then I was in early beta, and full beta for SwiftKey X... This version is even better than the original. I highly recommend everyone dl this for free and if you miss out, it is well worth the cost.
B00001X591|5.0|I'm sorry to say that I had always considered Albinoni to be a \\"one-hit wonder,\\" (and of course that one hit wasn't really composed by Albinoni).  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These Opus 9 concertos - most for one or two oboes, a few for violin - are a delight from start to finish.  My two favorites are the second (which, as other reviewers have pointed out, has a slow movement as lovely as anything you're ever likely to hear), and the seventh.  But there really isn't a weak composition in the lot.  I actually find these pieces more musically interesting than much of Vivaldi; and, because of the sheer sense of joy one hears in them, they often remind me of Handel.  The performances are absolutely first-rate.  Hogwood has brisk tempos without ever sounding rushed, the textures are clear, and the soloists are also very good.  Even at the list price of $18 (I bought a very good used copy for half that), this set is a bargain!
1400052181|5.0|Before I finished this book, I had no doubt that it earned a five star rating. I admire Rebecca Skloot for bringing this amazing story to light. She did a tremendous amount of research and the back of the book is very well documented. But this book is also very striking because instead of a book of research, it reads like an exciting novel. I tried reading this book at the same time as another and had to give up and read this one alone. If I had the stamina, I would have stayed up all night several nights in a row. Sadly, I did not want it to end.<br /><br />I hope that Rebecca Skloot has a very long career and writes many more books of this type.<br /><br />In this book, there were actually two stories at the same time but there is no problem keeping them straight partly because of Rebecca Skloot writing skills and also the stories intertwine. One story is about John Hopkins and other hospital's history of experimentation on patients, mostly poor and black, Henrietta Lacks being one of them. This story never really came out in the open until this book. The other one was about Henrietta's earlier life, the family that she grew up in and the family that she had.<br /><br />Actually the cells taken from Henrietta Lacks without her knowing it had a life of their own in research against polio, cancer, aids and many other diseases. Her cells even went into outer space!<br /><br /> I can remember the polio scare of 1951 because at the age of six, I was disappointed that the public swimming pools were closed. They were closed because of the polio scare. Later, there was a girl my grade school class with braces on her legs because of polio. I wondered why her and why didn't I get it.<br />The story about Henrietta's family was just as engrossing. I admire the author's persistence in uncovering the facts and showing how taking the cells affected all of the family.<br /><br />This is the best book that I have read this year so I highly recommend it to anyone interested in medicine and ethics.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My little punkin sleeps much more soundly with one of these in her mouth than with a traditional pacifier, because it stays in her mouth wayyy better so she doesn't wake up because it fell out. The animal's paws stabilize the pacifier and keep it from popping out of her mouth.  These things are worth their weight in gold.  Seriously.  We have the bear and the puppy, and both work great.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I upgraded from the regular SwiftKey app and this one is far better than that one which I considered great, worth every cent.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using this since it came out and it just keeps getting better.  The predictions are okay at first, but then they start to get really good, to where you maybe have to type half of each word.
1451629184|3.0|Wow.. where to begin...    This is definitely a very riveting read.  It's very short, and the only time you'll want to put it down is when you need to take a minute to have an emotional breather.  Like many others, I saw the interview with Diane Sawyer, and Jaycee's attitude about everything that's happened to her is unbelievable.  She seems so warm and friendly, she's optimistic about the future, she isn't letting the horrific events of her past bring her down.  And you can feel that attitude throughout the book.  It definitely isn't professionally written, but she knows that and tells you not to expect that.      I have to say that I definitely recommend this book... BUT I feel like I can only give it 3 stars.  The first third of the book was the most detailed (and yes, some of those details are horrific and will leave you stunned) and the part I went through the fastest.  The last third or so, taking place after she was found, was incredibly emotional and uplifting.  Like I said, her outlook on life is inspiring.  But the middle part of the book was the hardest to get through, for me.  The passage of time was never clearly marked.  In the beginning, her first few years in captivity (up until she had her daughters) were very detailed and had a pretty clear passage of time, and then all of a sudden the pace and tone of the book change quite a bit.  One part I had problems getting through was the journal entries.  There is point in the book where Jaycee stops narrating the book, and instead uses journal entries to tell the story.  The entries cover a time of nearly 10 years (1998 to 2007), and they are certainly very interesting to read.  She talks about her hopes and dreams for the future, her wish to run away and be free, and so many more things, all very deep and thoughtful.  However, I would have enjoyed it much more if they were interspersed with more narration of Jaycee's, written in the present day.  I read a review from the NY Times that said the early yearswere full of shock, and then they settled into a \\"weird domesticity.\\"  It's that domesticity that I wish I knew more about.  The day to day life, and how she got through it, and how she interacted with her daughters (who were brought up as her sisters)... all of that is lacking in the middle part of the book.    And yes, I know this will get me some scathing comments, but like some other reviewers here, I found the talk about her pets to be excessive.  I understand that they were a huge part of her life.... but I felt like she talked and talked and talked about them... and yet barely mentioned her relationship with her daughters.  Sometimes I feel like she talked so much about the pets in her life in order to avoid talking about harder things.  It's like the pet sections (and they are numerous) are just fillers.  I appreciated learning about her strong connection to animals, and how much they helped her get through the days... but I did not find it necessary to learn the names and colors and personalities of every single dog, cat, and bird she owned.  Maybe it's because I've never been a big animal person, so maybe I just don't understand that connection... I don't know, it was just very hard for me to keep reading about them, I had to resist flipping ahead.    Overall...  if you're looking for the day to day minor details (take \\"Room\\", for example, it focuses very much on what the captives ate for dinner, what they did after dinner, etc etc) of Jaycee's captivity, you won't find it here.  If that's all you're looking for, you will get just as much information from the interview she did, so the book isn't worth it.  But if you saw the interview, and loved her amazing attitude and outlook on life, definitely read this.  My 3 star rating is not a rating for Jaycee or her life or the terrible things that happened to her.  It is a rating for the book.  It is a riveting read, but you will speed through some parts and crawl through others.  Many things are repetitive, some parts skip over things too much, and some parts are too slow.  It is very much written in HER voice, though, so that does make many of these things pretty forgivable.  Perhaps my expectation are a little bit high... but even with her limited education, she is a remarkably smart woman and a talented writer, and so I feel like the book could have been better.  Yes, it is a memoir, but it is still a published book (and surely it was expected to be a best seller), and I think it reads a little like a first draft.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I had never heard of this series until HBO's \\"Game of Thrones.\\"  I enjoyed the TV series so I decided to read the books.  I've read all 5 of the books over the last three weeks.  \\"Thrones\\" was excellent.  \\"Kings\\" lacked somewhat, but I have to admit the Red Wedding hit like a war hammer.  I had to put it down for a couple of days before reading again.  \\"Swords\\" probably had the best story lines but the songs were annoying.  \\"Crows\\" was passable, not quite as good as book 2.  \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" sinks to new lows.  Thankfully, Martin doesn't throw song after song at us but the book came off as more medieval menu than any great tale.  The way this book overlaps the last should never have been done. Martin would have done better when spitting this book from the last to do it in the conventional manner of timeline.  Splitting by character was horrid.  Maybe a split of this nature is OK for those who read the last novel 5 years ago, but having just finished \\"Crows\\" the chapters in \\"Dragons\\" that referred to events in \\"Crows\\" just lost any zing they might have had if he had split the book along time lines.  Martin's penchant for story line twists are beginning to get predictable.  Davos' fate was just one example of \\"no surprise here for me.\\"  Right from \\"Thrones\\" have learned that in George Martins world unless he has a chapter that the clearly disposes of a body, they ain't dead and will come back in one way or another later on.  Adding characters, multiple chapters devoted to Dany's and Jon's dilemmas, page after page of meal menus and countless repetitions of family motto's and remembrances of what someone said 2 or 3 novels ago just didn't make for great reading.  The \\"cliffhangers\\" are just \\"same old-same-old\\" George Martin.  Planning this for story for 7 novels may just have been too much.  May the seven help us.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|It is very interesting and entertaining.  I was a little surprised at the use of some bad language.  I guess they feel the need to insert a few where they can get a PG rating which to me is a shame because it is a good movie even for small children.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I was just using the beta and was about to buy the full version on the Android market. Was very surprised this was the free application of the day! I've been a SwiftKey fan since Amazon gave the first version free. This is truly a great keyboard.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|After hearing the song &#34;Chasing Pavements&#34; I just knew I had to get this CD. Beautiful voice. She just has to stand there and deliver, and she does.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|I trink that I dream of jeannie is a worderfull tv series I see it when I was a little girl in my country Dominican Republic and from that time I dream about the story and want to have it until now when I buy from amazon this last week Iam waiting for my packet and no can't wait to see it I know this is going to be a blast a ride in to the past the best that I can remenber the best decition that I make was buy it I recomended.
B0001I561E|5.0|Memorized this movie as a kid and forgot how much I love it. Works great, already watched about a half dozen times. Got it quick and in perfect condition
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I love this app. I was recommending it to everyoneUNTIL THE LASTUPDATE! Now, it just sucks it forgot all of my words etc. and what is with the huge prediction words?? Now I am stuck using swipe which  I hate.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Ive been using the free version of this for months and have been contemplating buying this, and now that its free, i couldnt be happier!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Epic. Yup, I don't use that word much, but this was epic!!!!! Part 1 went a little slow, but it's like building up to the climax of Part 2. Part 2 was AMAZING!!! Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts where they have the battle of hogwarts and it's awesome! The battle of Hogwarts was done great and it was great to see Hogwarts fighting back and the millions of death eaters all over. They got almost everything in the movie that was in the book! The acting is as always superb. The twist in turns are just as good as in the book and everything is done amazingly. This is my faborite movie now. It goes along at a very fast pace, there is always something going on! WATCH THIS IN THEATERS!!! I saw it at a drive in movie theater in 2D and am going to see it again at a normal one in 3D, because it's THAT Good!! No, the 3D doesn't ruin it, it works AMAZINGLY in 2D. I could go on and on, but you should just see it for yourself.         SEE IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!      *********SPOILERS AHEAD********:  I feel I need to express comments of spoilers both to the movie and book so watch it first.  Things missing from book: Aberforth did not talk to Harry as much and you didn't learn much about Dumbledore's past. As the movie people say, they're focusing on Harry. And I think Dumbledore talked to Harry more when he went into that dream state thingy.  I just want to say that Snape crying looks very odd. I mean all of the memories are done great, but Snape crying just doesn't look right. XD  Final Fight against Voldemort. Done brilliantly. As well as the whole thing where Harry realizes he is a horcrux and must die.  One thing I would change: Harry hugs Hermione goodbye, but not Ron. WHAT? Oh, well.  At the end I thought it was funny because poor Filtch has to clean up all of the rubble with his broom. XD Couldn't anyone use a little magic to fix it.  Mrs. Weasly killing Bellatrix, YES, they put this part in, people clapped at the drive-in I was at when she died. No one clapped when Voldemort diead, just when Bellatrix dies, because you gotta hate her. Great actor, though.  The epologue was done great with bthe same actors only made look more grown up. Apparently my friend claims Harry's face was a little crooked in the epolouge. XD Umm, if you say so.

B001E45XT4|4.0|I have been using these headphones for gaming and Skype for about a month or so now. Overall, I am super pleased with my purchase. The sound quality is almost as good as the nice 5.1 desktop surround sound speakers I have. The desktop speakers have a little bit better sound range, especially towards the low end, but that is to be expected. The headset is comfortable to wear for the most part, although after about 2 to 3 hours, it is nice to take them off for a bit to let your ears breath. If that is a major concern for you, than look at getting an open-ear headset. Mic quality is good. The other thing I really like is the tangle free cord. The only way I have been able to get it to tangle was to purposely tie a knot in it.    Overall, it is a good buy and you won't be disappointed.

0563486430|5.0|I am a huge fan of Doctor Who, and when I started this I didn't have very high expectations. Up until a little while ago, I hadn't even realized there were Doctor Who novels, and I only found out about this when I stumbled across a website of Doctor Who quotes. I was intrigued by some of the quotes they had there, and after reading some comments, I learned that most people thought it to be a good book, but with a slightly odd book. However, it was promised to be very 'shippy' (good romance between the Doctor and Rose) so I picked it up. I literally could not put it down. I read it in about two days, because I was so hooked and couldn't wait to read more. I found the plot to be exciting and dramatic, with twists thrown in that I wouldn't have guessed. I was very impressed with Jacqueline Rayner's style of writing, and felt she did a great job capturing the personalities of the Doctor, Rose, and even Jackie and Mickey who have small roles. Plus, there was some very lovely moments between the Doctor and Rose. All in all, it was a great book with plenty of humor, adventure, drama, romance and even some angst. If you enjoy the TV show, I would highly recommend this book. Even if you've never seen the TV show, this is still a wonderful book, which is a delight to read.<br />And, if you're a fangirl of David Tennant as I am, he reads the audio book version in his wonderful Scottish accent. However, it's an abridged version, so I'd highly recommend reading the book as well, in order to fully appreciate it.
B00002605V|5.0|We all know what a masterpiece this is, but anyway, this is NOT the Japanese SHM-CD. If you google the barcode, the results suggest that it's country of origin is USA/Canada. That explains why the sound quality is no different and the packaging doesn't even have any Japanese in it. This also happened to me with a few Dio records. Beware, if Amazon says it's Japanese, it's usually not!
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I first heard of 2Cellos when Amazon Germany e-mailed me saying that their debut album was available for preorder. 2Who? 2Cellos, like violinist David Garrett before them, seek to blend classical with rock. Luka ulic & Stjepan Hauser have lined up twelve songs ranging from U2 to Michael Jackson, Sting to NIN, even a dash of Guns n' Roses. However, what makes them unique from their competition is that these songs are totally unaccompanied other than Luka and Stjepan's blazing bows. That's right; no fancy orchestras, no studio wizardry, no overdubs...just...two cellos. If that sounds a little awkward, it really works in the context of most of the songs. Cellists Luka and Stjepan go beyond their classical roots and evoke any number of effects from their cellos, including rapid-fire bowing, pizzicato, and percussive slaps (think flamenco guitar). They bounce the melodies back and forth like a musical badminton match, seamlessly picking up lines from each other. The two have an amazing chemistry, even more so live (which is how they were first discovered after uploading one of their duets to YouTube and landing a guest spot on Ellen).<br /><br />\\"Smooth Criminal\\" is obviously one of the most high-profile of the songs here, if only because David Garrett did a stellar violin cover on [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]] (ditto for \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" on [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]). As these tracks are all acoustic, it can't compete with the tension of the original recording (or the opening drums and strings on David's version of \\"Smooth Criminal\\"), but it holds its own (the opening aggressive bowing is kind of painful; imagine a cello with laryngitis, and that's the kind of tone they're pulling out in the intro). I actually thought Luka and Stjepan's cover of \\"Human Nature\\" was more impressive, capturing the soft, dreamy feel of the chorus. I preferred the slower songs like \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Hurt\\" more than the rock-influenced songs, but that's a personal preference.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, there will be comparisons between David Garrett and 2Cellos, if not for the \\"stringed instruments play rock\\" angle then the similar (if not identical) song choices that both groups have recently recorded and performed. They're both young, very handsome, and a little edgy (2Cellos in particular both look like they could be the leads in [[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]), all of which will appeal to a wider range of fans than a strictly classical repertoire would. Both groups pay homage to influential bands with slightly different approaches. I found the acoustic cello-centric approach fascinating; in the absence of studio effects, Luka and Stjepan are forced to create their own soundscapes using nothing more than the cello.<br /><br />I really enjoyed their debut album, and look forward to hearing much more from 2Cellos in the near future!ence.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, there will be comparisons between David Garrett and 2Cellos, if not for the \\"stringed instruments play rock\\" angle then the similar (if not identical) song choices that both groups have recently recorded and performed.

B004FECNIO|2.0|I remember the highly respected Empire magazine giving a big spread to \\"A.I. - Artificial Intelligence\\" when it was first released in 2001 and duly awarding it their coveted 5-star rating. It was a movie of vision they said - and at the time - I thought they were right. But my oh my - how time and a new format can change things...<br /><br />Re-watching \\"A.I.\\" on BLU RAY in 2011 is a painful and frustrating experience - not just because the film hasn't dated at all well - but mostly because for a very large part of the movie the print on this reissue is awful...<br /><br />Why is the case? Anyone who's purchased \\"Minority Report\\" and especially \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" on BLU RAY will know of the 'saturation' technique Spielberg uses sometimes to get a certain look - a gritty, slightly smoked effect. Visually this means that the picture is full of shading and speckles - and 50 to 70% of \\"A.I.\\" is inflicted with this technique too. And while this may have been ok on DVD (hidden even), the heightening of BLU RAY has made many scenes unwatchable as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Instead of making the picture better - the BLU RAY has only accentuated the speckles and haze and made things worse. At times it feels like you're looking at a badly transferred video and not a state-of-the-art Sci-Fi film. Combine this with Haley Joel Osment's now irritating performance as the childlike Mecca David who wants his mother's love back (Francis O'Connor) and goes ceaselessly searching for a character in Pinocchio (dialogue above), the terrible circus-cum-torture scenes in the middle section with Brendan Gleeson looking like he's going to break into laughter at any minute and the dreadful sappy ending with Ben Kingsley's saccharine voiceover - and the whole thing reeks of scripted mess and confused vision. Some sympathy has to go to Spielberg who inherited Stanley Kubrick's story and had to viably bring his `baby' to the screen - but whatever your feelings towards the outcome, it is NOT going to be enhanced by this reissue.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - there are sequences that look good - even great - entering the futuristic city at night in the car through the huge heads with open mouths - flying out to Manhattan with the pleasure robot Gigalo Joe (Jude Law) in the flying/amphibious Police car - the discussion William Hurt has at the beginning with his students about making a robot that 'loves' for real - but these are few and far between. As most of the film takes place in the Swinton home (David's parents) and the headquarters of Cybertronics (the company that makes robots for all sorts of tasks), there seems to be no escaping the washed-out look of the film. The extras are good (the 2DVD set) but if the movie's unwatchable - then what's the point.<br /><br />I liked \\"A.I.\\" then and still think it has its very definite moments to this day - but let's be blunt about this - I just spent good money on a BLU RAY reissue of a film that is available on the DVD format for a pittance - and its not better - its worse - and absolutely not worth owning.<br /><br />It is of course a matter of personal taste and choice, but it has to be said - even if you're a rabid fan of \\"A.I.\\" - I'd say hire it first to see what it actually looks like 'before' forking out any money on it.<br /><br />BLU RAY Credits:<br />VIDEO: 1080p High Definition 1.85:1<br />AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio; English 6.1 Dolby Digital, Castilian Spanish 5.1 EX, French 5.1 EX, German 5.1 EX, Italian 5.1 EX Dolby Surround; Brazilian Portuguese 2.0<br />SUBTITLES: English, Brazilian Portuguese, Castilian Spanish, Danish, Dutch, French, Finnish, German, Italian, Latin Spanish, Norwegian and Swedish<br /><br />BONUS Material:<br />Documentary on bringing A.I. to the screen<br />Interviews with Steven Spielberg, Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law<br />Behind-The-Scenes featurette on the making of A.I.<br />Interview with Sound Designer Gary Rydstrom at Skywalker Ranch<br />Visit to Stan WinstonStudios with early \\"Teddy\\" footage<br />Interviews with Lucasfilm's ILM special effects group<br />Trailers, Storyboards, drawings and hundreds of photos<br />Plus other unnamed featuresTrailers, Storyboards, drawings and hundreds of photos  Plus other unnamed features
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've only been used it a small time.  but.  so far I really like it.  the neon blue keys are really nice and the long-press idea is really handy &amp;  works really well
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been waiting ages for this to be free on Amazon.  I've wanted to try it out since I first heard of it, but am an avid user of Swype.  I didn't want to waste money on a keyboard I didn't end up liking.  If I do like it though, I plan on buying it for my wife's phone.  Lets hope it lives up to the hype.
0765365278|4.0|Interesting world, characters were developed reasonably well. Short on action for long periods of the book. Hopefully the sequels will be better. Overall I'd give it a 3.5 but since I can't I'll give it 4/5 stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have never written a book review before but I felt compelled to come to this books defense. I almost didn't read it after all the bad reviews but I had to know what happened and I'm glad I did. It was the best of the 3 books and drew things to a great conclusion. It certainly wasn't the happy ending I'm sure that most people would have liked but it was more believable because of it.    Katniss is a 17 year old girl who lives in a very screwed up world and this book raised a lot of great questions about war, what you're willing to justify and how there are no real winners when killing is involved. The twists and turns that this final book brought were amazingly well thought out and I really enjoyed it.    Don't listen to the bleeding hearts who would have loved for Katniss to ride off into the sunset with Peeta or Gale, this book was amazing and I highly recommend it.
1599219751|5.0|The storyline has already been well outlined by my fellow reviewers, so all I really need do is give you an idea of the impact this gripping true story of survival had on me. As a demanding reader, it takes well-written, engrossing storylines to grip and hold my attention, but the 'Long Walk' has this in spades. Throughout, your emotions are constantly engaged, juggling through both fear and hope for the characters, struggling with them through the deadening temperatures of winter, pushing them through exhaustion and drought. There are also some truly heartbreaking moments here, especially when they lose their young 'emblem' of hope, it almost seems as if the physical loss is also such a severe psychological and metaphorical loss, that all must end in failure.     Every time I put this book aside, I felt almost as if I was also drained by the endless adversity this stoic band had to endure. I celebrated in their triumphs, wept with their losses, and was gripped with the book throughout, finishing it within a weekend, such was its compulsive power. It made me truly grateful for my life of soft comfort, when compared to the harsh brutality of their lives, with the land and the elements even more pitiless than their initial gaolers. This is a book to read which celebrates the heroic nature of the human spirit, and the boundaries which can be overcome by the force of will and determination. It is also a perfect antidote to our often self-indulgent, materialistic lifestyles. If you're looking for a compelling, epic tale of survival against all the odds, you won't find a better written or more engaging account than this. Strongly recommended.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Tried it out after learning and loving Swype. Just too slow to type after using that. Uninstalled after trying it for a few hours. But I can definitely see the appeal if you have a keyboard with actual keys...
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Who wants an application which can make it unsafe to use your credit card and passwords?  I was very excited until this warning came up when selecting swiftkey x as the default keyboard.  That will have to be fixed before I use it.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This television show is such smart, fun entertainment.  I had only vaguely heard of Veronica Mars when it was on the air, and did not actually see it until this past year.  It is not another teen/tween drama, but rather is interesting, witty, a little dark, mysterious, and so relatable with all things high school and fitting in.  I love the occasional film noir ambiance given to the Mars' detective agency.  The writers of this series have a really broad range, touching on issues of bullying, high school cliques, family troubles, parent/child relationships, and some great mysteries.  Each episode has a case that Veronica solves, as well as an ongoing mystery throughout the season.  I really like this format, as there is some satisfaction at the end of each episode, and a building suspense as the season goes on.  This is also true for the subsequent two seasons but the first is absolutely the best.  I like mysteries in general, and I expected Veronica Mars to be a semi-juvenile series but when the mystery is resolved, I really didn't see it coming.  I won't give anything away but it was good.  Do yourself a favor and don't look ahead!  I'm not sure how appropriate I'd find this for young teens but for the adult and young adult audience, it's great.
B000P3G8XK|5.0|This is cool. Lots of old school Body builders from that historical circle from the 70's.  Arnold toaking a hooter right after he retires. Just cool to look at and see what these guys were doing. Kind of a trip what Steroids can do. You look at this stuff and look back at the Steve Reeves days and earlier Body Builders and it is quite a difference.  Not too much to say. It all speaks for itself.  Those were good times back then and now were all old. There is another DVD like this one and I noticed that one says \\"25 year anniversary edition\\". And one does not. But they are the same exact DVD program. I bought two thinking that they were different but they were not. So I gave one to a friend. Just in case you wonder this like I did.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|why isn't the app free for the tablet =(. I love the app on phone. a little disappointed app for tablet not free but is a great App for the phone. Makes texting extremely easy.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|One of my favorite movies ( quite a classic---english edition with Colin Firth,2 DVD's).    Many of my family members borrowed and enjoyed this collector's set----and now I have it back to watch it any time --when other scheduled tv movies are less than appealing.    Beautiful,romantic love story without today's unnecessary vulgar language.
B004A8ZX2S|4.0|An impressive effort in non-rational filmmaking, \\"Tree of Life\\" will hit you sideways in the theater but grow on you over time.   Wanting to see a movie before the start of Judaism's Three Weeks of Affliction, I was drawn to the title - the Holy Torah (Jewish Bible) is called Etz Chaim (Tree of Life). Writer Terrence Malick hits a number of impressive Jewish notes including an opening quote from the Book of Job (38:4) and use of the song \\"Ha Tikva.\\" If his purpose is to induce humility of soul through use of Job then Malick succeeded brilliantly with me. In 38:4, G-d speaks directly to Job for the first time out of the whirlwind with one of His penetrating questions. Remember that any time G-d asks a question it's not because He lacks knowledge (The Blessed One's rhetoric is eternally rhetorical).   Malick's story then circles around this truth. He holds up the grandeur of G-d alongside the pettiness of human beings. Human shortcomings are best demonstrated by Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) in his jealousy of others' material possessions and his compartmentalized religion including his inability to stay in the exaltedness of the classical music he enjoys and plays. O'Brien's militarist mindset is a pathetic attempt to get control of his surroundings and strike at what haunts him.   Mrs. O'Brien outlines the spiritual tug of war in explaining the ways of grace and of nature. She probably elaborated on this in her prayers sprinkled through the film but they were whispered and my less-than-perfect hearing couldn't pick them up (my only complaint with the movie).   The O'Brien household takes on an \\"East of Eden\\" feel although when we encounter Sean Penn's urban-locked character it's really the West (USA etc.) and its contrast to Eden that's being drawn for us. Like Adam and Eve, the O'Briens have three sons although \\"Tree of Life\\" eschews the brother-killing-brother theme. Penn's character ends up a city dweller/builder like Cain of the Book of Genesis. The O'Briens lose their home. The drive away from the family homestead conjures Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden. Recall that the Tree of Life was what became dangerous after Adam and Eve's sin with the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. A snake does not try to tempt Mrs. O'Brien (surely an oversight on Malick's part - joking).   By covertly grasping for such grand themes, Malick likely sent some rationalists rushing to the box office to demand their money back. Instead, the rationalists should let their minds wander through Malick's gorgeous film and G-d's glorious garden tasting fruits that expand the senses of wonder and thankfulness.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Like many people, I've been waiting and watching the blogs to see when GRRM finally would announce that he finished this puppy.  Well, unfortunately, it's not been worth the wait.  The characters all seem extremely two dimensional (and it's not just because I'm reading it on a Kindle now,) and it seems to be that GRRM has been concentrating more on the food than on advancing the plotline.  Another helping of eel pie, please!  Perhaps that's why this book took so long - the author may have been eating around the world rather than writing.  Anyway, Daenerys simply wanders around saying \\"I'm only a girl\\" and does nothing - where's our bold Khaleesi who conquored the Free Cities?  \\"Jon Snow, you know nothing.\\"  Well, yes, other than how to make a deal.  Have to admit, Jon Snow has actually become the most grownup character in this.  And my poor Tyrion!  For a man who ran Westeros, now doing dog and pig tricks is quite a step down, and his only ambitions appear to be find Tysha and killing his siblings.  But unlike before, now he just goes with the flow.  Actually, that describes this whole book - everybody goes with the flow, and nobody DOES anything.<br /><br />Ah, well, it could be worse.  He could spend the book writing about everybody's dresses and Nynaeve pulling her braid.

0375842209|5.0|The way this is written is SO inventive and unexpected.  The first bit confused me but it all became clear as the book progressed.  This author as some others books out there too, not as good but well worth reading such as The Messenger.  This, along with Cutting for Stone and The Help are my favorite reads of the last two years.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|The prediction on this is excellent. I've never typed faster. There may be a bit of an adjustment period but it's very quick and you'll be writing entire emails in no time.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|When trying to explain why I love this record so much, I've realized that words cannot explain the greatness of this album. It just isn't possible. The closest I can get I guess would be: a mesmerizing, spacey voyage that'll lift you out of your seat and transport you to an entirely nother realm, to be pushed and pulled, turned and shoved in every which way by excellent musicianship, beautiful vocals, transe-inducing drumming, ambient sounds that will make you forget your existence on the planet earth. Now that that completely failed to really describe the experience of listening to Frances the Mute, I will use one word that I thinks gets closest: perfection. This album is absolutely perfect. In every way. Its just flawless. It will take more than a few listens for it to fully reveal itself, but once it does, and once you are completely transported into another state of being by this album, you will know what I'm talking about. Lesser minds complain that its 60% noise and 40% music. This, my friend, is exactly what makes it so good. Its not just a straight forward rock album that lays out everything it has to offer on the first listen with nothing else to reveal or learn, the \\"noise\\" sets the ambience and is exactly what enables you to transcend everyday existence and visit a new reality for 72-ish minutes, (nearly 90 with the Frances the Mute single, which is quite possibly their best song overall by the way). Ignorant people call it pretentious, but these people can just go back to their Shinedown and Nickelback and let us real music listeners experience real music by real musicians. By the way, all this is done completely sober, its so good that psychedelics arent needed to drag your mind into another realm, this album will do it for you if you allow it. Anyway, yes, this album is flawless in my book. Enjoy the journey my friends. Infinity out of 5 stars.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I bought this app last week for both my samsung charge and my XOOM tablet.  It is an impressive bit of software.  I like the split keyboard for my tablet, as it allows me to easily type while holding the device. The predictive text is spot on.  I am able to send lenghty texts with only a few keystrokes.  Even though i paid 4 bucks for 2 installs,  it is worth every cent.  Getting this app free today is a no brainer.  DO IT!!! This keyboard with all its power makes the stock Android,  OEM,  and other &quot;so called&quot; better keyboards look like cheese graters in comparison.  Swiftkey X has set the bar with this one.  Install was simple.   (sent using Swiftkey X on Motorola XOOM)
B00009V7T2|5.0|This record is hard to describe. In factm, the first few times you listen to it, its hard to listen to. Cedric's vocals are sharp and piercing at first, in time they become beautiful and mesmerizing. Omar's guitar works is frantic and over-stimulating at first, in time it becomes brilliant and trance-inducing. This album has two faces. One is the album I heard in 7th grade when I listened to it, fast rock with high pitched vocals, and fanatic guitar work and drumming know what was going on. Now, however, this album is a journey. If and when this album finally reveals itself to you, it will take you on a mesmerizing voyage into another dimension that you cannot escape. It lifts you right up and puts you in the story. With you, as Cerpin Taxt, fighting your own mind in a twisting, writhing, painful, beautiful, glorious adventure that only relinquishes its grip when the album climaxes in the final seconds. This album, I thought was the definition of perfection, until I listened to the Mars Volta's second record, Frances the Mute. That album is indescribable with words. There are two kinds of people in this world, those who prefer De-Loused, and those who prefer Frances. Which one are you? You better study the records to find out. I give this album 9.99 out of 10, whereas Frances is easily an infinity out of 10. The only thing that would've made this record better was total freedom on part of the musicians, as much as I love Rick Rubin, he really simplified a lot of parts and made the production too crisp, and the vocals just ever so slightly a little too whiny sounding. For Cedric's real vocal performance, reference Frances the Mute. As well as for Omar's true music composition, and Jon Theodore's transcendental drumming. The only thing missing off Frances that De-Loused has, is the sound manipulation of Jeremy Michael Ward.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|I loved season 1 of Haven, it is so nice to see something fresh and quirky, it's true, \\"twin Peaks\\" meets the X Files\\".  With all the rubbish reality TV around, I love being taken to a place where nothing seems real.  thats what entertainment is to me, it's escapism.  The stories are great, it is so well written and the location is awesome, I want to move to Nova Scotia!!! pLease don't let this show disappear, follow it, love it, and lets have lots more of it to come.
B000JIHP88|2.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1QZNNM6SB2S7U]]I Bought this Mobile and it stopped moving in two weeks per the attached video. It works fine if you remove the fabric leaves that come with it. I would recommend this if you are ok this happening as a couple other people have pointed it out in reviews. However the fact that it stops working deserves low marks.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|this keyboard works great on my thunderbolt,  my only complaint is that it doesn't have a compact keyboard option,  something I'm used to using especially since I switched over from a BlackBerry before I got my Droid. Add the compact keyboard and 5 stars you shall receive!
1400082773|1.0|Too wordy. His sentences ramble on and on and on, changing subjects and stuffing in as many big words as he can. I had much more respect for him before I read the book. I am sure he has a lot of valuable insight to share I just wish he could get over himself so I could stop falling asleep throughout the book.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is superior to the stock keyboard.  it should capitalize first letter though.  Hopefully that will be changed.  20 minimum is silly.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using the beta version since it was released and was actually about to upgrade to the full version when i found out amazon app store was giving it for free!!! the predictions are very accurate and i love the neon theme design. would like it if the keys were slightly bigger only cause my husband has big thumbs and it would be nicer for him. other than that no complaints i love it so 5*
1250004349|4.0|This novel tells two separate storylines simultaneous, having the reader switch back and forth each chapter from one to the other. I enjoyed that as one storyline is particularly heavy and harsh (about the holocaust), while the other is a modern day story without much trauma. Just as I couldn't take another page of the first story, I'd get a break as I was switched back to the other one.    This book started off strong and did fizzle out with a predictable ending but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|I won't talk about the movie itself because that's something else that takes too long to get in to.  I'll just briefly go over what's necessary to convince you to buy this exact item on Amazon.com.  First, the blu-ray transfer is top notch as far as I can tell.  I'm running it on a very nice 55\\" Sony Bravia LCD LED tv with a very nice Sony Blu Ray player & Sony 7.1 BraviaSync Receiver with Bose Speakers and subwoofer.  I'm an audiophile and cinephile, but I couldn't measure the differences really in a coherent manner well enough to describe the details to you.  It looks great and sounds great.  That's all I can really say about that.  Second, the release of The Final Cut itself is spectacular to the Nth degree, partly because of the re-edits, but mostly because of the clean up and remastering and what not.  The packaging and shipping, well done as well.  It came in a few days and wasn't damaged at all.  Not much to really live up to with just a Bluray to be sent.  Overall, don't hesitate to buy this classic.
014241543X|5.0|Mia has it all, a great beautiful family and a loving boyfriend, and a life filled with love and music, but when a devasting accident takes it all away from her will she choose to stay in this life or leave with everything and everyone that left her?<br /><br />Number One: Why the HECK did I wait so long to read this book. This book was OUTSTANDING, and I took a while to write this review because I don't think I can honestly do this book justice. Gayle Forman is now on my Auto-Buy list with this one book, and by far this is the best book i've read all year, and is one of the best books i've ever read. I loved it. It was super emotional right from the beginning. I was saying how upset I was that books never seemed to make me cry, and I was sad that NO book would invoke tears in me, and this book made me cry within the first 20 pages.<br /><br />Gayle Forman's writing was breath-takingly real and emotionally driven. The picture she paints makes you feel like your living Mia's every move, and every page broke my heart a little more. If you have not read If I stay yet, don't be stupid like me and READ IT NOW!! I cannot wait to get my hands on Where She Went, and I believe this book has been sold to be made into a movie and I don't even think this book needs a movie. Gayle's writing made me feel like i've already watched the movie because her writing was so vivid and intense.
B000003CMB|5.0|this is a great, great cd. A must have. Even if you only think you might like the allman brothers music buy this one now. you will be very happy you did!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Good functioning keyboard but a bit limited as far as it only allows a choice of 3 words when typing.  Themes and color schemes also not very pleasing to the eye.  Cannot complain too much as this was Amazon's free app of the day.  Download it and if you don't like it, switch back to whichever keyboard you were using, no money lost.  I switched back to Better Keyboard 8 (free), which is much better IMO.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|This movie reminded me of a new age Poltergeist, with the exception of more freakishly animalistic villains.  I would highly recommend cutting off the lights and watching this movie.  One of the best horror movies that has been released in a long time!  I was left with a jaw dropped facial expression in more than one scene, and better yet you will find yourself secluded from others in the room, who are watching the movie with you!  Definitely a movied to add to my horror collection, and yes as some critics grip about, the sound quality isn't what it should be (i.g. the sound increases exponentially when a monster introduces itself, and then drops when the characters are speaking, but nonetheless, this is something you can work with!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|For anyone getting the not signed properly message, make sure you uninstall ALL other versions of SwiftKey from your phone. This should allow you to download it. I had the same issue when I got this the other day. It's the most amazing keyboard ever. I barely have to type anything!
1427210276|5.0|It made me like Darcy more, she grows up in this novel and I must say she has grown on me I will be sad when this story ends.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|rushed my nexus one.  Used it to write thiispelt review. You be the. Judge.  Adds pun tuition for me.  I am so testing. Get.  Should would use this thing<br /> Seems to be a failure.  Why put carriage return?  Can you read this?  I am not sure I will use it more.  Predict text is collection but not my bag.<br /><br />Update 2011/08/12  I finally uninstalled it.

B0018M6J90|5.0|This is a fun, fast-paced, sweet movie that my whole family (that's mom, dad, grandma, and kids) enjoyed watching together. A case of mistaken identity leaves impoverished, stodgy Miss Pettigrew filling in as the social secretary (and moral barometer) to a flighty singer/socialite in Depression Era London. The whole story takes place during one crazy day where Miss Pettigrew tags along for a day in the life of her polar opposite. The effect these two women have on each other makes for a bit of a transformation as they both come to grips with what's really important in life. The thing that struck me as unusual about this movie is its sweetness and charm. The story is just plain sweet, and that is incredibly refreshing to me after the cynicism and violence that pervades modern culture. I recommend this movie to basically everyone, and at such a steal, you simply must buy it!
B004K4AUZW|3.0|It gets you moving.  I enjoy dancing to most of the tunes.  Some of them were a little too long for me.  But I  liked it for the most part.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I honestly think this is the best of all Disney animated features, and I've thought so since I first saw it in the theater. The fact that it lost the Best Picture Oscar to Silence of the Lambs (a sick, disturbing mess) still convinces me of the imbecility of the Academy. Anyway, when I found out this movie was being released in Blu-ray, it was my only request as a Christmas gift. This is a classic among classics, and in Blu-ray it looks even more colorful and lovely.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Won't download the english language pack and then force closes....complete waste of time...and i never used anything but the old swift key
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I feel badly, giving the book only 3 stars. My heart bleeds for what Jaycee Dugard went through. I remembered being so scared when she disappeared, having a child of the same age. I am so delighted that she survived her ordeal and I pray that she and her family can recover their lives.  However, it was a disappointing read. While she gave a lot of detail, I felt that there was also a lot of fluff, to make it long enough to be a book. There were pages of diary entries that really provided little insight into her ordeal.  A recipe from her mother????  I enjoyed the end of the book, when she spoke about the steps in her transition back.  Maybe the earlier stuff was too hard for her to write.  I felt like there were lots of facts, but very little emotion except when she was talking about her cats.      I wish Jaycee the best and I am so glad to know that she lived through her awful young life and hope that the next 60 years are filled with peace and the love of her family.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I bought this book the day was released, but it took me a few days to start it. I needed to get myself to a place emotionally where I was ready to read it. I saw the Diane Sawyer interview, so I knew to prepare myself. I'm glad I did, because it was an amazing read.<br /><br />Jaycee talks about her life before her abduction, and recalls in great detail the day she was taken. She remembers it so clearly and describes it so vividly. It's heartbreaking to read. How scared she was, how confused. She was so young, so completely unable to understand what was happening or do anything about it.<br /><br />So many reviewers have admonished her for not fighting back, or for not running away. These people clearly did not read her account of what happened. She was ELEVEN. Stun gunned, handcuffed, and locked in a shed for years. Garrido was huge. There was no way she could fight back. What she did do though, was survive. She was able to figure out very early on what she had to do to lessen the severity of her attacks. She knew she had to please both of her captors, make them happy. To be so young and to survive that horror is unbelievable. She did what she had to do to survive. I have the utmost respect for this woman.<br /><br />No, we don't hear much about her daughters. There are many reasons why this may be. The Garridos didn't let her be mom. She was their \\"sister\\". Only after they were rescued could they truly live like mother and daughters. This is also HER story, to tell how she feels is best. And, honestly, I'm pretty sure she wants to keep them out of the spotlight as much as she can. This case is everywhere in the media, and she doesn't want their faces and names plastered everywhere.<br /><br />I strongly disagree with those that say the book isn't well-written. Is it Shakespeare? No. But that wasn't the goal of the book. People are bored with it. Really? How in the world can you be bored with this woman's story? Her voice comes through so strongly through the entire book, and you can see her strength with every word she writes. To call it boring is to completely miss the entire point of the book. It is not meant to be entertaining. It is not meant to be a fun read. It is a memoir. It is her own story in her own words. And it is incredibly powerful and an amazing read.<br /><br />Jaycee, you faced unimaginable horrors. I could not believe just how strong you were when I watched your interview with Diane Sawyer. You truly are a hero and an inspiration. I wish you and your family all the happiness in the world. You are beautiful and you are strong. May you always know the love and support you have from so many people around the world.ngth with every word she writes. To call it boring is to completely miss the entire point of the book.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|Be carefull with this product!!  It only worked 1 hour and now is dead  It won't charge after a full discharge, i tried everithing, awfull support on the gsrmin site.  After investigating aparently i'm not the only one with this issue  No way to ask for refund as i don't live in the us anymore
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Hands down the best keyboard I've used (I've tried 4). Really does adapt to your typing/language preferences as you go along.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a great keyboard.  It has perfect auto correction and incredible powers of prediction.  I highly recommend it to anyone. I&apos;ve tried several keyboards including swype and the built in android keyboard and this is better by far.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Thanks amazon!! I was using the beta version and i couldnt justify paying $4 for something i was using fof free yesterday. Anyhow, thus keyboard can actually complete your sentences!
0439023521|1.0|This book was awful, it's follow-up worse. Brutal, predictable, and not any fun at all. Not what I'm looking for in a book. It didn't sound good but I let people who'd read it and liked it talk me into it. Mistake. I'll never get those hours back again and I could have been doing something like ramming my head in to a wall.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I bought version 1 for my Droid 2 and I love it. I was using the beta until it was released, now I have upgraded to SwiftKey X and it's still great. I did download this to my Asus Transformer, but it doesn't work very well on it (as stated in the description). I'm rating it based on my Droid usage. I wish they would have the tablet version for the free app of the day, but I may have to buy that one. I have tried a few other keyboards including Swype, but I didn't care for any of them. I'll stick with SwiftKey.
B00005JOA0|4.0|I just finished watching this miniseries.  I have never read the book, so I cannot compare it with that, but I very much enjoyed the miniseries.  However, there is one point near the beginning of the third and final episode (at about the 12:20 mark) where I got confused and thrown off for the rest of the movie; it wasn't until later when I went back to rewatch that part that I discovered where my understanding had gone off track.  I'll explain what happened below (spoiler alert).    ...At about the 12:20 mark into the third and final episode, Gilbert Markham is in a coach, going to see Helen who has returned to her husband Arthur Huntingdon (after her husband sent someone to retrieve/abduct her son Arthur, Jr.).  In the coach, Markham is reading the book/diary Helen has given to him.  He reads, with her voice-over, \\"So began the final chapter of our marriage...\\"  What it is very easy to miss is that the scenes that follow are picking up the flashback to the time BEFORE Helen has fled from Arthur -- i.e., picking up the flashback once again right after the scene from Episode 2 in which Arthur said that if Helen ran away, he would always find her.  However, I got confused, and thought that this \\"final chapter of our marriage\\" was taking place after Helen had returned, and was picking up right after the scene that ended at the 11:30 mark of Episode 3 where Helen brings her son into her sick husband's room.  This led to all sorts of confusion on my part, with me ultimately thinking that Helen had fled and returned twice or something.  (Which of course led to more questions: \\"What was the point of her having her husband sign away the care of Arthur, Jr., when he then starts giving him wine, having him hunt birds, etc.?  When was it that she left the first time; where did she go? etc.\\")    My guess is that the problem stemmed from a desire on the part of the writers to end the second episode with the cliffhanger in which Helen's son is being abducted, more or less.  Thisseems to have necessitated their delaying a huge chunk of the flashbacks until the third episode, and thus putting pre-flight scenes AFTER post-return scenes.  I'd say it was a bad choice.  Even if one doesn't get confused at the point where I did, it's still a bit odd to invert the scenes with her husband that way.
B000KITQK2|5.0|I am using a older cheaper than 2 grand acoustic in a duo environment, with a fishman pickup, and this was a gamble for me, but as it turns out, it was a great purchase, it lights up my axe, and really makes it sound mucho better, I suppose the fishman eq for 119 bucks would work great, for the money, I think I made the right decision. It also is a direct box, and cuts the noise down, when you unhook the guitar, which is another plus!
0307346617|1.0|In as few words as possible, this book was just unenjoyable for me. It is written in the style of hundreds of interviews with people of all walks of life throughout the world.    While the imagry was well done, this book just never put me into the zombie world.  It did not scare me. I felt no empathy for the survivors.    I am certain that a lot of people will find this style of writing thorougly enjoyable, but to me it is just boring.    I don't often say this, but i would love my money back.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Thank you, i am so glad you made it free. I love it! Best keyboard on Android! Thank you again.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I bought this a while back and I love it. The predictions are so amazing I think SwiftKey knows what I want to say before I do.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Overall it was a funny tale of Tina Fey. She lost me as a reader toward the end when she expounded on the details of child rearing. I moreso enjoyed her dealings with leadership and management. Overall good read.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|I did not enjoy the movie at all.  The plot was weak, it was slow to develop and I found myself watching my watch as much as the movie
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book doesn't read like a normal plot line. It requires a lot of piecing the story together from others. It makes it difficult at times to remember who is who and what is going on. Enjoyable nonetheless.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I actually really like the functionality of this app.  it types faster than swype, but it can't be saved to the sd card so I won't be using it. I just  uninstalled it because of that. It's really too bad.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Haphazardly thrown together with a strange ending. Seemed that the author either gave up or didn't know where else to go.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used the Swift Key X beta and loved it. This is even better.  The tablet version is a must have as well.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I just bought this in the Android Market the other day for $2 (half off deal) and it's well worth $2 or $4. But it being free...  you can't pass this app up.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|The new update is terrible. On the previous version it would automatically capitalize a letter after a period now it doesn't as well as before when I wanted to type 'I'm' all I had to do was press 'i' and 'm' and it would auto add the ' now I have to add the apostrophe until this is corrected just use your standard keyboard it is better.
B0039V8NJC|2.0|What a waste of a book that could have been really powerful!  I went back and read the critical reviews and all I can say is that the critics had to have been motivated by a sense of political correctness (a misplaced \\"such voices - exotic? diverse? multi-cultural? anti-american? - must be heard\\") in reviewing this insipid, uninspiring and ultimately (and this is THE big sin in my book) boring story.     But let's put political correctness aside.  After all that's not what we are (at least I am not) looking for in reading other people's stories; instead I hope discover a little bit more about life's universal truths or something that resembles them when I put aside an evening to read such a well-reviewed book.  Re. the politics: the politics of blaming America for 9/11 and justifying Islamic terrorism is palpable just below the surface (protagonist feels happy when twin towers come down!) and it is annoying BUT I am completely comfortable with even that assumption as long as the writer can draw me into a compelling narrative with a protagonist who has something convincingly righteous (in his own mind) and/or true to tell us.  None of this happens.      The other annoying issue is the use of the device where the main protagonist tells this story (all past tense) to a visiting American in Pakistan post 9/11.  The device is annoying because of how the story unfolds; additionally the tone that the author uses for the protagonist is one of a cheap tout or local tour guide which is simply incorrect and misplaced.  No Pakistani from a well-placed family like the protagonist's, educated at Princeton, worked at a top NY financial services firm would talk/behave in this manner with a visiting American.  I doubt if American readers will pick up on this false note but it was jarring for me (I am from India and do have a good sense for how such story-telling might play out).      Finally the story is uninspiring because the protagonist is torn, confused, misguided by a sense ofguilt and a feeling of being an outsider and never quite resolves or understands any of it.  The only distraction is that he manages to fall in love with a white American woman -- but she in turn is in love with a dead man (yes ironical, cruelly beautiful but finally uninteresting); even their single sex scene evokes only pity. All of this might also have been fine except that there is never any kind of insight or redemption or even a glimmer of hope that the protagonist is on some sort of a journey.  Life's-a-bitch-and-then-you-die is the easiest kind of story to write.  Perhaps it is interesting to some people.  But for me it's primarily lazy, insufferable and boring.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm going to give this app a 5 star rating because I \\"know\\" it is a quality app. I've seen it in use through a friends phone (who got it through the Android Market). Do I have it installed on my ASUS Transformer tablet? No. Why? Because this same company releases two separate versions; one for phones, the other for tablets. Is Amazon offering both at the same time? No. Should they be? I believe so. I was contemplating getting it on my tablet but haven't done so yet. Then.. ..I see it listed as today's free app and quickly rush to see if the \\"SwiftKey Tablet X\\" version is also free and it isn't. I know, \\"Boo hoo\\" for me, but still. You'd think Amazon would consider offering both at the same time. Way to alienate your tablet users, Amazon.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|amazon app of the day. but have been using it already for months! I use it with a stylus often on a bus where it can be bumpey ; works great for me. I mostly type a little and then pick the right words...
0553801473|2.0|I stopped counting how many years I have been waiting for this book to come out, and now that it has... what a disappointment. This book is one huge filler, made to extend the series a couple books more and make GRRM a few more bucks. The only chapters interesting enough not to hate are Jon's and Dany's, and that's only because I already have a interest in them from the previous books. The Tyrion chapters get better, but not by much... here is why.<br /><br />All Tyrion does for the majority of the book is travel, I feel like I am reading the hobbit (funny because he is one). Same thing Stannis, going from one place to another and not really doing much. Honestly, there was one chapter that just told of how Stannis' army was dieing off on a march to Winterfell, that's it, nothing more. Afterwards I was like \\"Ok, that was it. Stannis is having a hard time walking through the snow... is that it? Really?\\"<br />Theon chapters are horrible for the same reason, GRRM tries to make us despise and pitty Theon for the majority of the book and does so by doing nothing but writing about his miserable situation/ interacting with more characters I don't give a crap about every single chapter.<br /><br />IT GETS OLD! HONESTLY WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? I GET IT ALREADY!<br /><br />Dany and Jon just stay in the same place dealing with the same problems throughout the whole freaking book basically, NOTHING HAPPENS. Which is basically the theme of the book, nothing worth caring about happens.<br />The best part of the book is the end (like most books) but in this case the first 88% of the book was such a bore that the ending could by no means at all compensate for it.<br />The whole book is a build up, wtf this isn't the first or second book things need to be rolling. The dragons... wait what dragons? Guess they are not big enough to do much, yet can't be controlled as it is right now? Like that's going to change when they get bigger?<br /><br />Honestly GMMR just die so someone else cantake over the series. Your spent. (just kidding fat man)<br />There are some pros though, GRRM is a great writer. It is just that sometimes he goes into a little too much detail about things no one gives a crap about. I find myself reading some chapters and at the end thinking \\"I kind of understand the significance of that chapter I just do not know why it was so long.\\" The book needs to be edited. It's like he doesn't know where to go with the series, which isn't true he just wants to pump out a few more books like I previously mentioned. This is sad, because we have been waiting for so long.<br /><br />Overall if you're a fan the book it is obviously a must read... I would just wait till the one after this was close to coming out before reading it. That way maybe all of this bore and tease of a build up book will actually take you to the book that we all have been waiting for (the next one hopefully). Let's just not take a lifetime getting there this time.
B004V7XWEE|5.0|I doesn't get any better than this.  Long heralded a classic, the 40th anniversary of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, contains everything a true lover of his music would want.  It contains instrumentals, early versions, vinyl and cds.  Marvin was at the top of his form during the reording of the timeless masterwork.
B000000WJ4|5.0|This is an excellent album.  It really could have been packaged as a double album along with the album, Let Me In.  Both have the same jazzier backup band. Note the upright bass on the cover of the CD.  Johnny really cranks out some superb guitar as always.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I was really intrigued in the first half of this book. The concept is really interesting, and Diana, the main character, started out quirky, super-intelligent, magically gifted, a bit on the obsessive compulsive side, and obviously flawed. But she was also strong and independent, and ultimately likeable. Unfortunately, by the time soul mate status between Diana and Matthew was declared, her character seemed to lose its spunk. Although I think I understand the author's attempt to show growth and change in her characters, I was ultimately disappointed with the results. I'm reading a book on witches, vampires, and demons, so yes, I know how to suspend reality for a while, but I don't think the fantastical lends itself to developing relationships. Halfway through the book Diana's character became needy, and needed her man by her side in order to live and breathe. Matthew, too, became completely dependent upon Diana's presence. They wound up being an old married couple too quickly for my taste, and I would have liked some of the tension (and quirkiness) to have remained. And the peripheral relationships didn't fare much better; after knowing Matthew for 40 days, she calls his offspring her son? After spending a couple of weeks in a remote French castle, she is convinced it is her true home? I'm just not buying it. Even when secrets all of the characters have hidden from one another are revealed, resulting tensions you might expect are either quickly resolved or non-existent. And I have to agree with a previous reviewer about the strangeness of the unnecessarily large number of pages dedicated to Diana's drinking tea, eating, sleeping, and waiting for Matthew. I didn't add anything to the story.   On a positive note, I liked the plot and the historical references throughout the book. I had to keep my laptop on while reading in order to Google some of the more obscure ones, which definitely helped to keep my interest and attention.
1451629184|1.0|I saw her interview on TV and really wanted to read this book.  I am sure that it was therapeutic for her.  HOWEVER, this book is a bit TOO detailed for me.  I am sure pedophiles will be enjoying the more detailed passages.  I think those pages could have been toned down.  I realize that this is her story and this is NOT her shame, I get that.  I just think it could have been a bit less detailed.    As for the book, it is an easy read, and a quick read, at that.  I congratulate her and understand her not wanting to try to escape.  She was 11.  She wasn't even sure where she was. He became the one that was her world.  It makes perfect sense.      The details are why I starred this so poorly.  God Bless Jaycee and her 2 daughters. The lives were stolen from all of you.  Live the rest of your lives in blessings and heal.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|Many have credited J.K. Rowling with reintroducing generations to reading, her clever blend of myths, the supernatural, religious beliefs, and genres, and her remarkable rags to riches story while maintaining her charm and integrity. On the other hand, I also fault her with reviving serials; endless stories about the same characters and making this element an almost crucial requirement of teen literature. There is no Twilight without Harry Potter.<br /><br />One thing she did pull off, however, is a maturity and growth in her writing as the series progressed. She took one fully realized story and split it into seven increasingly darker (and longer) novels. While I grew tired of the story by the sixth installment and never bothered to read the finale (although I did skim the end just to see who dies), I admire the scope of her vision.<br /><br />Sadly, the final movie is crushed by the expectations and hype it has generated. The sub-culture of Rowling's amazing creation grew bigger than the story itself. The supremely convoluted plot, crumbling under the sheer number of subplots and frayed strands of characters complete with their own back stories, could not fit easily into a movie, even one that was made into two parts.<br /><br />I'll admit this; the final movie is everything its predecessor wasn't - fast-paced, action-packed, and entertaining. In all eight of the movies, there was only one where I left the theater in stunned amazement at how boring it was, and that was Part 1 of this two-part finale. In the end, however, I felt no dramatic tension and nothing happened that truly surprised me. In fact, some of the revelations/closures felt cheap and almost laughable. Speaking of, more unfortunately absent is a sense of humor.<br /><br />In trying to squeeze too much into one film, there proved little room for anything else but a never-ending stream of perplexing explanations, final battles, and hurriedly cauterized plot threads. Everything was life and death serious at the expense of the charm of the first four installments; i.e., the ability to laugh at itself and the knowing wink that we're all part of the fun. The movie theater was funeral silent throughout and it was all my kids and I could do to stifle the need to snicker and chuckle at how ludicrous it all was. Within the first ten minutes or so I almost burst into laughter at the comically serious conversation between Harry and an elf. Has Rowling (with help from George Lucas and CGI) resurrected our culture's obsession with fantasy to the point where I'm supposed to not be amused by the sheer lunacy of it? Am I to accept equally World of Warcraft with The Godfather?<br /><br />The emotional urgency of the Potter faithful (one word: Trekkie) has become larger than the books or movies. Articles have been written about how the finale is a bittersweet cultural event and that we are all part of the public eulogy for the Potter franchise.

The movie theater was funeral silent throughout and it was all my kids and I could do to stifle the need to snicker and chuckle at how ludicrous it all was. Within the first ten minutes or so I almost burst into laughter at the comically serious conversation between Harry and an elf. Has Rowling (with help from George Lucas and CGI) resurrected our culture's obsession with fantasy to the point where I'm supposed to not be amused by the sheer lunacy of it? Am I to accept equally World of Warcraft with The Godfather?    The emotional urgency of the Potter faithful (one word: Trekkie) has become larger than the books or movies. Articles have been written about how the finale is a bittersweet cultural event and that we are all part of the public eulogy for the Potter franchise.

0307595862|4.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly.  I find it interesting that in the editorial review section for this book, Connelly is quoted as saying, \\"\\"Jo Nesbø is my new favorite thriller writer and Harry Hole my new hero,\\" because, unlike others who compare to Stieg Larsson, I actually see more parallels in Connely's Harry Bosch series (or possibly Henning Mankell's Wallender books, but not nearly as dark in their condemnation of contemporary society).  Both Harrys have seen the unseemly dark underbelly of society but soldier on to fight the good fight.  Other than the Scandinavian link, I really don't see the Larsson connection. After reading this book as a follow-up to [[ASIN:0061134007 The Redbreast: A Novel]], Nesbø has moved up to be my third favorite author behind Connelly and Stephen King.  I can't wait to read Redeemer, Devil's Star, and Nemesis which actually come after The Redbreast, but before The Snowman sequentially.  Also, I understand The Leopard has been translated, but does not seem to be available directly from Amazon U.S. - it would appear that the new and used copies listed here probably originated in the UK.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists (some of them relevant, some not) to keep the book well-paced and a pretty good up-all-night, page-turner. I was engrossed throughout and fully invested in Harry Hole as a \\"hero\\" for the modern world.  Read this if you like a good mystery - you can't go wrong.
B005DD7TI0|4.0|Good actors, a while to build up though, but it delivers with good acting and a descent ending. Plot added a lot to work with. Actually a fairly good one, the plot. Worth the watch! db
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used several different Android soft-keyboards, and this one is by far my favorite. I found Swype to not be so useful once the novelty wore off, for example.<br /><br />Contrary to the privacy fear-mongers, I believe SwiftKey is pretty clear about what they do. Be aware that if you opt-in to certain personalization options, Swiftkey does collect the information you allow them access to in order to optimize your experience. This can include SMS, Twitter, and Facebook (I chose not to give them access to the last one).  If you choose not to, I believe it is still an excellent keyboard, and recommend it highly. They've made it clear that they will collect and use statistical information as well, but that's a far cry from publishing your credit card info.<br /><br />Overall, I think there isn't anything suspicious about what SwiftKey does. It's a fantastic app.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|I love this kind of music, so I'm very biased. The Blue Oyster Cult esq vocals, the Mercyful Fate-ish riffs & at least a passing mention of Satan in every track. This band rises from the same ol' same ol' 70s metal & pioneers something that sounds familiar yet innovative at the same time. Frontman the 'Ghoul With No Name' (I kid you not, that is what he's called in the band) & the rest of his disciples spread the message of the 'Dark One' with infectious grooves and clever melodies.  Very very catchy band. Not recommended for Christians, you will be greatly offended by this band. The rest of you Wiccans, Satanists, Witches, Anarchist & whatnot... enjoy, welcome home - this band is for you to worship amongst your covenant
B003UESJEM|3.0|The movie, The Company Men,  touches on the economic downturn and American's loss of jobs. Ben Affleck plays Bobby Walker a successful MBA at GTX (a global shipping company) that suddenly finds himself out of a job when the CEO shuts down several divisions.    Walker(and the   in this movie) are wealthy: they own large three-story McMansions in well-manicured neighborhoods, drive flashy Porsches and their children (who attend private schools) are sent to extravagant senior high school trips to Italy. Although some say that their socioeconomic status makes the characters hard to relate to (since they aren't everyday, average men)I believe that the screenwriter used \\"wealthy men\\" to show that the job loss crisis is affecting all American groups. No one is spared, and there is little, if any loyalty left in Corporate America.  In fact, it is ironic that Walker is let go, since he is responsible for downsizing and getting rid of other employees at the company for cost-saving measures. (This is hinted at by Jack Dolan (a character played convincingly by Kevin Costner).    Like many Americans, although Walker is living the facade of a rich, easy life -- he is, in fact, is living paycheck to paycheck  -- having to worry about meeting higher house payments (after a mortgage reset) and other expenses. By the end of the movie, he learns that family is more important that image or riches.    Although the movie ending is predictable (like others have pointed out), it's a still decent movie.
B003VDZK8K|1.0|most appropriately titled album. I've liked everything they've done up to this point. And even had high expectations due to the Rev passing away (usually a death like that results in a band putting out a masterpiece in memory of their fallen bandmate) & Portnoy stepping in seemed very promising. Everything was great until they put out the title track as their first single. Just a terrible terrible song, I still decided to buy it since the band has yet to let me down...  guess what, they finally let me down.  the album just sounds very generic & doesn't seem like the band put very much effort into it.  By far their least creative effort. All the guitar solos sound very similar & the lyrics are just cliches sewn together. Even songs that are suppose to be 11 minute epics are just repetitive & uninspired. There is one song where the Rev sings backing vocals & it's really chilling but then the song just goes nowhere & ends.  Really wish they took their time to work on perfecting the album.  Their competitor Trivium tore this band up by putting a masterpiece of an album called Shogun. I was kind of hoping A7X was going to do the same.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I downloaded the app, cause it has almost 5 stars, but when I go to select the language, English (us), it says can't connect to network, but I'm connected fine, even on WiFi. I even rebooted my phone, still gave issue. 1 star until someone can help me make it work on my phone. HTC EVO 4G.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is great. I liked swype but I love this keyboard app! I hope highly recommend you try it out!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I have so much admiration for Jaycee Lee Dugard's brave and optimistic attitude toward life after what must have been absolute hell.  Most of us cannot even imagine what she endured. To go through what she did and still have such a positive outlook on life is reminiscent of \\"Diary of a Young Girl,\\" by Anne Frank.  To come out of the hell she has been through with such a wonderfully strong spirit is inspirational.  I am even considering leaving her foundation some money in my will, I was that moved by her story.    At first I was annoyed at the pedestrian manner the way the book is written.  I'm used to reading books that are written in a more erudite manner.  However, I then started to view Jaycee's writing in a different way.  No, this book is not written in a sophisticated manner, but it is written from the heart AND from the viewpoint of an 11 year old girl.  I became transplanted back in time, to the mind of an 11 year old child who was desperately trying to make sense out of her world and to survive.      I applaud you, Jaycee, for all you endured.  You deserve ten lifetimes of happiness and I hope you can grab every brass ring life has to offer for both you and your girls.  Your story is heartwarming and so inspirational.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|As someone that is used to the stock keyboard on my OG Droid and loathed the keyboard on my Droid Charge (one of the reasons I returned it), this keyboard will be with me whenever I upgrade to a different phone as I probably won't be blessed with a stock keyboard ever again. It's fast and the layout is pretty nice!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Absolutely get this app.  If you don't have room, delete something. I paid 4 bucks to upgrade from the beta version, and it was well worth it. This app learns from your writing style on Facebook, Gmail, and from your text messages. I am constantly amazed at how well the predictive text works. It will often predict the next word I was going to type without even entering the first letter, simply from the context. In fact, I have seen this app predict as many as 4 words in a row correctly.<br /><br />Did I mention you should get this app? Get this app.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard for android. Swype is nothing compared to this.  If I knew this was this good, I would have bought this a long time ago.
0307472841|1.0|It is hard to believe that this novel is from the same author of The Dogs of Riga.  Endless, dull and disconnected theme abuses the reader's patience and intelligence.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I also had issues downloading the language pack and it gave me an error. I uninstalled Swype on my phone and was able to install SwiftType properly. So far, I like this keyboard. Its a little on the slow side when using the precision type of texting.  Its also neat that it learns from your FB,  Twitter and texts. I did notice it tried to send me an update via Amazon Appstore but it got squared when I removed Swype. - Rooted 2.2 Infuse
B003L77G8I|3.0|Tis' not the Hannah arc that ruined BONES for us. It is Sweets' irritating mouthy girlfriend! We thought the writers had written her off when Sweets broke off with her. Good riddance then! To our horror, they brought her back ... and have Sweets all over her again! Come on! Kick her off already!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I would love to have a Red Theme added. That would complete my phone's Red Theme all together! I like the Dark, Neon, and new Pumpkin themes, but Red would be awesome! THANKS
159562015X|5.0|This book came recommended to me and I had already read it but bought to additional copies, one for me and one for my sister. Good book and a fast read.
B005D63RQK|5.0|Incredible.  I wasn't sure whether the first episode of Season 4 would be able to live up to what Season 3 ended with.. But to my absolute pleasant surprise, it did. It went above and beyond every expectation I had for the show.    You'll be amazed by the characters once more and I cannot wait till Sunday for the next episode.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love this application way better than swipe works great on my g2x especially now that I have gingerbread. Easy to use just follow the directions.
B00280LYHS|5.0|A few friends of mine dragged me out to watch the movie Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief.  I thought it was pretty horrible, but the idea intrigued me.  So, after I got home, I picked up the novel.  I have to say, the novels are much better than the movie!    As far as writing style goes: Rick Riordan isn't Faulkner, he's a pulp fiction, good old fashioned paperback writer.  On the other hand, he is also positively ingenious with the way he interjects ancient myths into a modern story, and you can tell he really likes the material.  The result is a really well-paced, action-packed story that is perfect for teens and young adults.      For adult-adults:  It's good fun without a lot of thought.  The kind of book I like to call \\"candy,\\" you know the kind of mindless entertainment you reach for when you want to forget about your stressful life for a few hours.  Moreover, it's the best kind of candy, because it's easy-to-read fluffy fun without being overly stupid or insipid.  There are definitely moments when you'll know you're reading a book aimed at teenagers (particularly since it's written from a teen's point of view), but there's nothing that will make you want to hurl your kindle across the room in exasperation.      So, my conclusion?  Read it!  At the very least, it's entertaining.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This product is excellent!!! buy it !!! its a really nice tripod.  the holder, can adjust to any phone.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Stephen King is still a weird, weird guy.    But, he's a wonderful writer.  He's also written quite the inspirational tome for aspiring and budding writers.  At least, that's how I felt while reading this book.  In fact, I felt the uncontrollable desire to pen the next NYT bestseller well up inside me as I delved into each chapter of King's autobiography.    Now, keep in mind, that's essentially what I felt like this is, and not so much a guide on how to write.  There IS some great advice mixed into this book.  As some reviewers have pointed out though, this is geared more toward experienced writers or, at the very least, people who write.  This book is not for people who would like a guide to the bare basics of plot and syntax.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|OK, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Despicable Me a lot. This says a lot as I find Steve Carrell completely overrated as a \\"lead\\" comic actor (sorry, don't get the appeal at all of \\"The Office\\"). In this, though, the accent he comes up with to voice the \\"Despicable Me\\" character of Gru is brilliant. Visually the movie is very very cool with crazy-looking vehicles and just a sort of art deco look to the backdrops.<br /><br />Yet ultimately there were some odd choices. I felt the mother character (voiced by Julie Andrews) was a waste. It was in there to explain how Gru became what he is but I felt it took valuable screen time away from what was fun about the movie--the relationship between Gru and the three orphan girls he adopts (one of which is voiced by comic genius-in-the-making iCarly's Miranda Cosgrove).<br /><br />I also thought the cool freeze ray and shrink guns worked but the squid and piranha ray guns were jokes that fell super flat. Also, the massive weaponry set up to protect Gru's nemesis, Vector, was just dumb. Why not have something just as funny as the freeze or shrink ray? It's like the comic writers gave up half way through on that.<br /><br />Throw in the fact this was made for 3D and there are plenty of 3D moments I found just in there for affect.<br /><br />The little yellow minions are cute and fun. Maybe they needed no explanation but I was left throughout the movie wondering, what are they supposed to be--mini-Twinkies? Yellow Mexican jumping beans? Also, why did some have one eyeball and some two eyeballs. What was up with the strands of Homer Simpson hair on their heads? Why were there so many of them? What was up with the goggles, overalls and the whole welder look? Was it a parody of Flashdance or some Soviet era industrial joke?<br />These are not vital questions to know the answers to, and I do hate kids' movies that explain too much but could the writers not have given us something to chew on for that? I just thought the yellow minions, as funny as they were, were just plain out of sync with the whole \\"super villain living in the Boris Karloff-like home\\" vibe.<br /><br />To top it off, the extras seem to want to sell you the video game for the movie (and also have a lame game on it you can play on your computer). The \\"Making Of\\" extra is pretty good, but even there they don't explain what the deal was with the minions?<br /><br />Lastly, the title is terrible. Gru, if anything, is not \\"despicable\\" really. He's more a cartoon villain (well, it is a animation after all). The cover of the DVD has one of the minions front and center, but in the movie they are not the focus at all as they are more the comic relief.<br /><br />I don't know. Like I said I enjoyed the movie but something was really off about the whole thing such that it doesn't quite take the leap and enter the upper echelons like the Pixar flicks or Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs do.ain out of sync with the whole \\"super villain living in the Boris Karloff-like home\\" vibe.

0307887960|5.0|Alright i'll be specific.  1. Stay away from greek yogurt. The Dr says its good for you however, In my experience it tastes horrible.   2. Oat Bran is not a hard product to find. I thought I was going to have a field day trying to find it based on others reviews. So much to my suprise I go into a Cub Foods at the dispensor thing and poof there it is.   3. Drinking lots of water vs pop hasnt become a problem. I came to one conclusion if I was going to attempt this diet id have to get my self off Pop before starting it so I did. The only down side is I lack energy going without caffeine.   4. Granted I am on the Attack Phase day 4 to be more precise it has not been that difficult. The only difficulty I had is I never used to eat 3 times a day It took some getting used to needless to say. Eating nothing but Protein there is nothing hard about it you are given multiple do's and dont's.  5. The biggest advice I can give anyone trying any diet is be prepared. That means pre preparing all your meals so you dont loose motivation.   6. I am not sure on exact weight loss thus far but I will be editing as time goes by.  7. Like I stated before Its a safe diet I feel fine the only problem I have is no POP How I miss my dr pepper.      Edit   survived phase one of the diet. I wouldnt go as far as to say I lost a tremondous amount of weight, having lost maybe 7lb at most. Do not be alarmed I expected this having failed the go run or walk 20 minutes a day. Due to the nature of this current herniated disk I am unable to excersize. So I am opting to follow just the diet portion. Phase 2 doesnt appear to be that difficult just eat veggies every other day until you hit your target weight.
0345529057|5.0|I bought this book set because I got sucked into the HBO show, Game of Thrones.  At this point, I'm just about done with the third book and looking forward to reading the forth.  I heard a fifth book was just released (which I will be buying), and the author has stated that he will probably write another two books until the series is complete.  The pros are that it's a very entertaining read, I enjoy the story a lot, and it's very well written.  The cons are that it's not a complete set of the series and two of the books aren't even written yet.  You could spend hours reading thousands of pages, and then have to wait many years for the remaining books (I heard his fifth book took 6 years), and once released, you may not remember characters or situations and will have to reference/re-read previous books.  On the bright side, the HBO series is very true to the books (at least the first season was nearly identical to the first book), and is apparently a hit (so it'll be sticking around), so it might be enough to just watch the future seasons to the series to get you back to speed once the future books are released.<br /><br />Edited to add: The third book was awesome, and had a lot going on.  I'm about 350 pages into the fourth book, and it's SLOW.  Very bored with the book at this point, but will push through.<br /><br />Edited to add: Well, after trying to get through the fourth book, I've stopped reading it, way too boring, and too many characters to keep track of.  I might pick up the series again once I hear the series has been completed.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard, the prediction is better than any other keyboard I have used.  Having said that, holy crap does it use a lot of RAM.  I checked a few minutes ago and it was using 41mb vs the 9mb that swype uses on average.  As much as I like this app, I will have to hold off on using it until I get a phone with significantly more RAM as I have too many other apps that I find more necessary.
B002OG5GT8|1.0|Bought to help boost the sound on my MP3 player.  I followed the instructions and tried adjusting it well listening to music but my MP3 player was actually louder when not connected through the amplifier.  I wouldn't recommend this product.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I finished this book three days ago and I still cannot stop thinking of it.  That's extremely rare for me, so that truly means that this book is a gem.  Beautiful, touching, and extremely romantic.
B0038ZITIE|4.0|Sam Jones IS Flash Gordon!    This movie is one of the earliest theatrical release super hero flicks. Was it in response to Superman in the mid-70's? Maybe, but I'll tell you this film is fun - and Superman wasn't (have any of them been fun?).    The sets are great, the acting is appropriately delivered with intentional tongue in cheek work done as an homage to the serials and radio programs this film follows.    Sam Jones is appropriately hunky and handsome as well as athletic and debonaire as Flash. Max Von Sydow plays Ming the Merciless with such devilish fun that you at once hate him and love him.    The sets are dynamite and the film does not involve a cheese factor. This is a big budget film with Queen doing the soundtrack and special effects as current as possible (which are great given that this film pre-dates CGI).    Pick this film up for your collection. I did!
B0042RJWTC|3.0|I am engrossed in the series but am extremely disappointed that it is not closed captioned, or if it is, I am unable to view it in high definition.  I have missed dialogue and have to hope I catch up later in the episode.
0618526412|1.0|What a waste of time.  I seriously cannot figure out how this book was an Oprah book club pick.  The characters where unlikeable to me.  I didn't relate or sympathize with one of them.  I didn't feel that there was a true story with a conclusion or point of any kind.  It was down right strange.  I forced myself to read it because it was a selection for my book club.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  If you want a good book w/ likeable characters and a moral message, read to Kill A Mockingbird.  Now that's a classic.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is one of my favorite video adaptations of a 19th century novel.  I am a lover of 19th century English literature, especially the novels.  I would rank this video adaptation (quality of the screenplay/dialogue, costumes, production details, settings, acting, directing, etc.) on a level with the BBC's mid 1990s production of Pride and Prejudice.  This is a must-see if you love brilliant period adaptations of 19th century English literature.  It is especially meaningful when you realize that Dickens' father was at one point sent in a debtors' prison.  This novel and Bleak House directly contributed (along with public outcry) to Parliment's decision to do away with debtors' prisons.  Dickens was one of the great social activists of his time, in addition to being a great writer.
0545123267|5.0|I loved it and I'm purchasing the other 2 books today. It reads like the twilight series, intense, mythical and poetic. The story is different of course and well written. Highly recommended. i liked it more than the twilight series.
0385341679|5.0|I hate cliffhanger endings, and I almost gave this book 4 stars because it is the last book in the current series by this author and TWO of the books in the series had cliffhanger endings. To a large extent the review of a last book is always a review of the series as a whole.    But there is no question I want more. More books by this author. And even more books set in the same universe. Because although she did an excellent job of finishing up the arc, and tying up the threads, and taking care of the major players in the series, there are unfinished questions that could easily become part of the next series.     And it is such an interesting universe, I wouldn't mind spending more time there in the head of the next heroine.
B001SS3JS8|4.0|This is a love story, albeit a dysfunctional one.  Chris and Emily grow up knowing they are meant to be together, and fulfill everyone's expectations until Emily, wanting to break away, can find no other way to do so than to not \\"be\\" at all.  This is a fine example of Jodi Picoult's plotting and character development, and it raises a lot of questions about what it means to really know the people you love.    An excellent story that will leave you thinking.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I can't believe how much better this keyboard works.  Predictive text is surprisingly predictive! I also love the swipe gesturing to delete words and hide the keyboard.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I don't review very much, but SwiftKey is definitely worth it. I didn't have too high expectations, given I've tried several &quot;advanced&quot; keyboards before and was disappointed with each. The correction and word prediction work amazingly, which allows for much faster typing than on any other keyboard i've tried. However, it does take a little getting used to.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|There are SPOILERS involved with this review.  I have to include these because the GRRM fanatics believe that if you do not like this book, then you have never read the book and therefore if you post on any of the forums you must be a troll unless you include spoilers to prove you read the book.<br /><br />First, can we stop with the endless repetitions???  These are repeated hundreds of times throughout the book, after a while it is just worthless and we realize the Mr.<br /> Martin is just trying to up his word count.<br /> 1.Where do whores go?  The imp dsoen't know, we get it.<br /> 2.Reek, Reek, my name is reek, it rhymes with (?????).  We get it, reek rhymes with many different words, are you going to go through the alphabet?<br /> 3.You know nothing Jon Snow.  O.K. He's ignorant, can we move on?<br /> 4.I am just a young girl...Dany's young, are you trying to make sure we don't forget, or that you don't Mr. Martin?<br /> 5.Word are wind.  We know, we read your book.  We are surprised that it did not blow itself off the shelves.<br /> 6.Corn. Corn. Corn......Okay Ravens eat corn, we know.<br /><br />First of all there is way TOO MUCH filler and fluff in this book.<br /><br />At the beginning we are given page after page after page after page etc...of fluff just to find out that A) six skins dies and enters the one eyed wolf and B) that Jon Snow is a skin changer too, but dosen't know it.<br /><br />Conserning Jon we are subjected to a second retelling of Jon sending away Sam and making the baby switch. Did Mr Martin forget that he wrote this in AFFC?  Does he think his readers forgot (it has been a while)?<br /><br />After letting the wildlings cross the wall to help fight the others (somehow his seasoned brothers are all retarded and do not understand that they are undermaned and will die and lose the wall without help).<br /><br />Jon is then stabbed four times by his brothers.  We are never told he is dead and never see his body, so because of all the endless drivel at the beginning of the book most readers will have missed that he is a skin changer, so maybe he changed skins, maybe he is just wounded, or maybe he will come back from the dead like his mother.<br /><br />Bran finds the three eyed crow and learns that he is a greenseer.<br /><br />With the imp we are treated to his bathroom habits.  Do we really need to know everytime he goes to the bathroom?  Have a little bit of a hang up with the bathroom habits of little people do we Mr. Martin?<br /><br />Then we are treated to his travel log. Worse than reading a tech manual.  Words are wind Mr. Martin.<br /><br />He then becomes a slave, rides a pig in a mummers joust, walks away from slavery and on his word alone hires a sellsword company and joins them.<br /><br />The onion knight eats and we get to hear of every bite.  We know you like food Mr. Martin (we've seen your pic) but we do not need a play by play of his eating.<br /><br />A. Stark loses her sight and then gets it back and then commits her first assaination.<br /><br />Thon Grayjoy, through torture is transformed into Reek.  Eventually he helps Jane escape Ramsay Bolton.<br /><br />Dany keeps telling anyone who will listen that she is young, as if they or she has forgotten.  She chains up two dragosn because they are uncontrollable.  She then<br /> marries, and then flys away on the black dragon while Mereen is underseige.<br /><br />The prince of Dorn is killed by the green dragon (fire) while trying to steal the two dragons who are locked up.<br /><br />Mr. Martin thought his baby switching plot was so good that he told it again in this book.  Not only that but he was so proud of this \\"original\\" idea that he recycled it<br /> three times.  We are told that a prince of dragons was not killed during the first rebellion, but was switched as a baby and now he is back to retake the iron throne.

Do we need a play by play of the snow march?  Then we are told in a letter that he and his friends are dead (maybe a lie?).<br /><br />Mance Rayder (switched with rattleshirt) takes six spear wives and tries to free the Stark girl (again a recycling of the switching plot, she is not Stark but Jane).<br /> We are told in Ramsay's letter that he is held captive and the six spear wives are dead.<br /><br />There was supposed to be a continunity check but we find out that grayscale is not what it was.

The only thing he and Tolkin have in common is the \\"RR\\" in their names.

B004K7HMJ6|3.0|One thing about Jessie J that works for and against (in seemingly equal parts) is that she kind of sounds like an amalgam of a variety of popular artists today.  If you took Natasha Bedingfield and splashed her musicality with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna, P!nk, Lily Allen, Keri Hilson, Anouk and Christina Aguilera you'd have Jessie J.  The good thing about this is that she is versatile.  Her album shows a lot of range.  The bad thing is that she doesn't have any real signature sound to differentiate her from the artists I mentioned above.  She lacks the focus needed to create her own sound.  That doesn't mean that she doesn't turn out some good music.  In fact, some of the songs on `Who You Are' are exceptional; especially that title track.  The problem is that I'm not sure who she is yet.<br /><br />But Jessie has bigger problems rearing their heads on this album.<br /><br />Namely, it's the lyrical content, which is quite shallow in parts and just uninteresting and uninspired for the most part.  She doesn't stretch herself with her ability to write (which she's been doing long before she started to sing) and so her album pales in comparison to those of the artists she emulates (well, most of them).<br /><br />With an album like this, I really don't know where to start because there aren't many songs that sound similar (semi-great thing), so I'll just pick a place.<br /><br />How about the top!<br /><br />When she goes the `Natasha Bedingfield/Anouk' route she shines the brightest.  `Who You Are' is simply divine, and it closes the album perfectly because it actually had me wanting to listen to it all over again to find more kernels of that kind of brilliance.  That chorus alone is just ridiculous; it's nearly an event all its own.  `Big White Room' also has that ballad type atmosphere cornered, and it isn't as successful but it shows the range of Jessie's vocals with a stripped down live performance.<br /><br />Songs like `Abracadabra' have that whole 90's pop vibe (ala early Robyn, before she became a visionary) with a Beyonce-like upgrade.  They are fun and flirty but nothing monumental.  `Nobody's Perfect' has a far better result, simply because it infuses that average Beyonce style with something a little darker (something that Beyonce flirts with but should wholly embrace), more earnest.  Despite the lyrics being a tad tired and simple (for someone who made her initial impact writing for other artists, you'd think she would have saved her best work for her debut album) she really nails the delivery, and I love the way that she experiments with her voice, totally understanding that sometimes the unprettyness that she can pull out is all the more interesting (that bridge is phenomenal).<br /><br />`Do It Like A Dude' sounds like one of those ill-advised Rihanna numbers; you know, the ones where she tries to pretend like she has the cohunes to kill someone.  It's a total mess.  At the total opposite end of the spectrum is `I Need This', which sounds like manipulated inspirations that rides the rails of generic in every way; sadly.  Her Keri Hilson influence is seen on a few tracks.  `Rainbow' has that edgier feel, much like Keri's debut `Turnin' Me On'.  It's a fun and catchy, albiet not too original, song that has swagger that makes it a forgivable clich&eacute;.  `L.O.V.E.' is a little too simplistic in depth, but it has a nice feel to it, calling to mind more subdued Hilson.  If you asked Lilly Allen to sing verses and Christina Aguilera to sing chorus on a chaotic song about rising above childish torment, you'd have `Who's Laughing Now'.  Sadly the song is kind of cheesy instead of inspiring and far too chaotic for its own good.<br /><br />`Casualty of Love' actually has that aged R&B approach that Keyshia Cole has perfected over four albums (oh god, another artist comparison).  Speaking of `other comparisons', `Price Tag' sounds like Corinne Bailey Rae's `Put Your Records On' sung by someone with a more commercial voice (not necessarily better, just more accessible).  The song itself is bouncy but kind of forgettable, and I'm tired of people constantly trying to validate B.O.B.'s success; he's not talented so stop asking him to rap on your songs!  Back to my thoughts on `Casualty of Love'; it's soft and sweet but it feels like filler, far too aged and subdued for its own good.  When you tackle a `feel' like the one she attempts here (one that is nostalgic yet obviously outdated) you have to nail it or else it comes off irrelevant.  `Casualty of Love' is a casualty of poor execution.<br /><br />Songs like `Stand Up' and `Mamma Knows Best' don't really fit in with whole of the album, but they shine brighter than most of the other tracks.  `Mamma Knows Best' is totally Broadway, but so much fun.  It just sizzles, and while it's not as sharp as it could have been, but Jessie oozes so much vocal style that the song works magic.  `Stand Up' has a Michael Franti island vibe that suits her beautifully and is actually one of the best uses of her accent (I have a real issue when a singer only sings with her accent `sometimes', for it makes it sound unauthentic).<br /><br />In the end, I like this album and will continue to listen to it.  Jessie J actually has an extraordinary voice, and she uses it to the max here.  Her vocal talent far outweighs most big names in the business today (she stomps all over Beyonce, Rihanna, Britney Spears, Katy Perry and the like) but she really needs to find some focus, figure out WHO she is and what she wants to sing and then try harder to write songs that convey a deeper meaning and show more depth of writing ability.<br /><br />For those of you interested; my track ranking:<br /><br />1) Who You Are<br />2) Mamma Knows Best<br />3) Nobody's Perfect<br />4) Big White Room<br />5) Stand Up<br />6) Rainbow<br />7) Abracadabra<br />8) Price Tag<br />9) Who's Laughing Now<br />10) Do It Like A Dude<br />11) L.O.V.E.<br />12) I Need This<br />13) Casualty of Lovef is bouncy but kind of forgettable, and I'm tired of people constantly trying to validate B.O.B.'s success; he's not talented so stop asking him to rap on your songs!

B00062IDCO|4.0|Compared to TNG and DS9, Voyager ranked lower on my list.  But after time it began to grow on me, and I'm a little sad that there are no more episodes.  Season 7 is the only set I'm reviewing because it's the only season I bought from Amazon.  Lots of fun episodes like Q2, the conclusion to Unimatrix Zero and of course the finale, Endgame.  Thanks for the fun times Voyager.  Welcome home.
B00008EYA5|2.0|From the initial previews, one truly expected an adrenaline rushed film high on the action and low on the brains.  Well, it has very low brains (plot holes corrupt, and lack of logic reaches new heights towards the end) but I was disappointed in the lack of real bravado I saw on the screen.  Sure, there are moments of intensity, but overall the film lacks that special something that makes the heart race (or stop).  With a cast of likable faces (Farrell is such an underrated gem, Rodriguez commands attention, Cool J just oozes `cool' and Jackson knows how to work any tired angle he finds himself facing) it is the lesser knows that take attention away from the stars.  Up and comer Jeremy Renner (well, at the time...for he is now TWO TIME ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE Jeremy Renner) and Larry Poindexter steal all of their scenes with ease.  This summer blockbuster feels cheap and overall just doesn't live up to expectations.  Farrell was on such a role that I wanted this to be up to par for him (his CIA thriller, `The Recruit', which came out the same year, was nearly marvelous).  Instead, `S.W.A.T.' feels like lukewarm leftovers.  It doesn't have any real pizazz and fades quickly from memory.  With all that `charisma' floating around the room you'd think that one of them would make a real impact, but `S.W.A.T.' is a dry offering that is bound to please some but is never going to `impress' anyone.
B000MXPE74|4.0|A great CD with a sound that reminds me of the Beatles in their later years; great harmonies and innovative style. An older sound that has been modernized for these newer times. It is refreshing to hear a band that isn't trying to sound like every other band that is currently trying to make a name for themselves.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|No finer keyboard than this one. Predictive text become a need once it's used.  Was a five star before the &quot;x&quot; update. Now it deserves to be given its very own 6th star. Combine that with unmatched developer support and you have to buy this...... NOW!
0525946284|4.0|Follett is probably best known for his wartime spy stories, e.g., \\"Key to Rebecca\\" and \\"Eye of the Needle.\\" We find these novels fairly good, but were totally wowed by his two medieval tomes; yet sorely disappointed in a story he wrote in contemporary time (\\"Third Twin\\").<br /><br />In this tale, it's just a week or so before D-Day, and in France, everybody seems to know the big day is imminent, including the Germans; and the French Resistance is gearing up to create as much accompanying havoc as possible. Meanwhile a cathedral has been converted into a major telephone switching center vital to Nazi efforts to communicate throughout their occupied territory and back to Berlin. When a wily female Brit spy \\"Flick\\" leads a small renegade group to bomb the facility by hand, their efforts fail when bad intelligence fails to reveal the size of the Gestapo and other forces guarding the center. Flick escapes back to England, where she and her supervisors decide on a risky scheme to create a six-woman group (code named the Jackdaws) to go back disguised as cleaning ladies and try again with more of an \\"inside job\\" approach. However, a member of Rommel's staff, a clever officer named Dieter Franck, who witnessed the first abortive attempt on the communications center, tortures some of the captured members from the earlier raid and learns enough to play a cat and mouse game with Flick all the way to the second attempt.<br /><br />Follett has crafted a terrifically suspenseful plot, and it's easy to root for Flick and her cohorts - but even the Nazi's show some signs of humanity. And while the outcome is somewhat predictable, plenty of deaths occur along the way to remind that, after all, it's war. If the author's war stories suit your taste, \\"Jackdaws\\" seems a fine entry in Follett's novels of that genre.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Only 1 good thing about this app and that is that it does have really good word prediction. That being said, the stock system is pretty good too I think. When there is nothing about this new keyboard (which is mostly just different skins) that makes it worth paying any money for. It was free for me and I don't even want it taking up space on my phone.
B001LF4ARC|4.0|The book Inside Steve's Brain is an unauthorized biographical account of Steve Jobs.  The author uses stories, interviews with Jobs and those close to him, as well as the author's own first person accounts to give thought-provoking analysis of how Steve Jobs thinks, his working habits, leadership strengths, personality traits (both good and bad), management habits, and much more, and relates these things to how Jobs turned a small, startup company that began in his garage into a multi-billion dollar powerhouse that is Apple.      Leadership is critical to a company's success, and in reading this book, it became very clear to me that Apple would not be the hugely profitable and successful company it is today without the leadership of Steve Jobs.   One leadership quality I took away from reading this book is Jobs drive to surround himself with remarkable people.   Take, for example, Apple's marketing.  Jobs knew that Apples success depended not only on innovation and quality, but also on strong marketing and advertising.  Jobs hired former Pepsi president and marketing executive John Sculley to successfully market Apple products.  Jobs sought to learn from Sculley, and looked to him as a mentor and teacher.  Apple boosted its marketing budget, and became famous for its \\"lifestyle\\" advertising.   Jobs didn't try to master marketing by himself.  Rather, he sought John's Sculley's expertise to learn from, and wasn't too proud to be taught by an expert who's already been a huge success in the field of marketing.       Jobs is incredibly customer-centric.  He looks to design products always with the customer in full focus.  He is a perfectionist and a stickler for details when it comes to designing products for the end user.   New product development will go through hundreds, sometimes thousands of reworks and prototypes until it is exactly what Jobs wants.  Jobs has instilled a mindset of putting the customers needs first, above and beyond chasing a profit.  In doing so Apple has created technology that millions of customers can't wait to get their hands on, and in turn generated huge profits for the company.  Many companies could learn from Apple's notoriety for putting the customer's needs in the forefront.  How many times have we seen competitors like Microsoft rush software to market with profit, rather than the customer experience,  as their primary concern, only to find out later that the software is filled with bugs and malfunctions, causing many customers grief and wasted time. (Think Windows Vista).  You won't find this type of scenario with Apple.  To Steve Jobs, the customer experience is first and foremost when developing new products.     In reading the book, I learned what the Osborne Effect is. The Osborne effect is a term referring to the unintended consequence of the announcement of a future product ahead of its availability and its impact upon the sales of the current product.  Often times the the Osborne effect can mean that customers stop buying the current offerings, while waiting for the new offerings that have already been announced.  At Apple, most employees don't even know what products are being developed, and the ones that do (which are very few) are forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, and swear to keep the information a secret even from family members. Those who are needed for small parts in a project are typically on a need-to-know basis.  Secret rooms will be used with only key members of trusted groups to discuss and develop new products.  Jobs goes to great lengths to avoid the Osborne Effect, and has insisted on a level of secrecy at Apple beyond what most companies demand.       Those who have worked closely with Jobs describe him as a master motivator.  He can be incredibly disappointed, and at times berating, if you fail, while acting almost like a doting, happy, approving father when you succeed.  This seems to have a very penetrating effect on one's motivation, and I found myself empathizing with those who work with Jobs, and trying to imagine what this would be like.  On the one hand, knowing your boss will be very disappointed, and possibly insulting, if you fail, and on the other hand, knowing he will be incredibly happy and approving and complimentary if you succed, has the psychological effect of pushing a person that much harder.  Though this approach may have the ability to give his employees that extra push to succeed, does it justify insulting and berating those who fail?  Absolutely not!  The ends don't justify the means.  Jobs  doesn't follow the Golden Rule.  I have a boss who is never insulting, berating, or mean to his subordinates.  He is very happy with me when I succeed, and if something doesn't go right, he chips in and offers help to find solutions to the problem.  I respect this management much more than the approach used by Steve Jobs.    I enjoyed reading the book, and appreciated the author's objectivity in writing about Steve Jobs.  He showed neither favoritism, nor disdain for Jobs.  The book gave me deeper insight into Steve Jobs and his importance at Apple.  He is without a doubt the driving force at Apple.  A  business icon.  A   phenomenon.  After reading this book, I'm convinced that when the day comes that Jobs leaves Apple, we will all witness the steady decline in Apple's innovation, quality, and dominance.
1451629184|5.0|I just finised reading the book minutes ago, and let me just say I am amazed. It blows my mind all this girl has been through, and in spite of it all she SURVIVED. Her will is made of iron! It must have taken so much courage for her to write this book, and I hope now that she has done so she and her family can have some peace. I have read some of the previous reviews, and I recall one that was chiding her for writing about her pets, and that there aren't enough details about day-to-day while she was in captivity. Seriously people???She was kept alone in a room 24/7 unless and until her captors came to abuse her or bring her food. Her pets were a form of salvation for her; a means of trying to stay sane. This same person went on to comment how it \\"reads like a first draft.\\" Anyone who would say such a thing is just being harsh, it is so easy to hide behind a computer and talk smack about someone else's work. I would be interested to read some of that reviwer's writings, they all read like \\"final copies,\\" I am sure. To anyone who would fault Jaycee for how the book is written, in my humble opinion- you are forgetting one important thing, the basis for the entire book she wrote: she was kidnapped at age 11 and was locked in a room alone. She had only completed 5th grade at the time she was abducted. I think she did an amazing job on the book, and I am in awe of her bravery to do so. Jaycee was robbed of so much, and yet she is able to see and focus on positives and be greatful for the simple things in life. As I read I was in tears: in the begining when she talked about all the vile and despicable things that were done to her. Then near the end I cried tears of joy when she was finally reunited with her mother, aunt and sister. All in all, while many parts of the book are unpleasant and gutwrenching to read in their subject matter, I am happy that I read this book. I have learned through reading about Jaycee's experience that no matter what bad things happen to you, when you think you can't go on anymore, you can. Like Jaycee, you can be robbed of everything: family, innocence, personal freedom and you can survive. I wish Jaycee, her daughters, and their whole family success in their lives, love and most of all peace.
B001HN6922|5.0|I almost skipped this movie because of the reviews. That would have been my loss. No, it is not like the first \\"Cars\\". It doesn't develop the former Cars characters as well because it is a fast-paced spy movie with some new characters, who are developed well. But the humor is excellent, the graphics are amazing, and there is a strong emphasis on cherishing your true friends who really love you the most.   Especially for kids ten and older, and adults who enjoy NASCAR, this movie is fun! Given all the junk that is out there for kids to watch, why be so hard on this movie? I've watched it twice and look forward to viewing it again so I notice all the wonderful elements I missed before. In my opinion, the best children's movies and books are fascinating to adults too.
B0038AL7M4|4.0|After Boccacio 70 release, the idea to gather other directors around Poe's trilogy was in the air. Specially when Mario Bava and Roger Corman were in their creative zenith along the sixties.<br /><br />So, Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Federico Fellini showed their respective approaches around Poe's obsessions.<br /><br />Vadim explores the fatalism that surrounds the soul of woman who is sexuallly obsessed with a man who accidentally dies due an awful episode. The blame and the sense of guilty that accompany her (the sensual Jane Fonda by then)will lead her by gloomy paths.<br /><br />Malle (the most existentialist of the exponents of the French New Wave)bet for william Wilson a dark personage of the Army who suffers from a split personality. this chapter is to my choice the most interesting of all of them.<br /><br />And finally the amazing tale of Fellini in which the existential terror and hilarity shake hands in this Faustian tale. Fellini reexposes with remarkable approach the starring of 8 1/2. Terence Stamp - a cult actor - is outstanding with this performance. Watch him carefully at the final sequence and itw ill be hard to remind to a very young actor who was about to emerge: Christopher Walken.<br /><br />A memorable and outrageous set of stories that must be present in your invaluable collection.

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|For better or worst, this film was unfairly forgotten by most of audiences. Taylor Hackford proved why he is one of the ten most original and creative directors of the North American scenery.<br /><br />Baryshnykov and Hines embodies two sides of a same coin. Both are outlaws in their respective countryplaces, so they have decided to cross over the boundaries in order to find the conditions to shine by themselves, far from the crowding world.<br /><br />But an ironic airplane accident will put in motion the reverse mechanism in the Rusian dancer, who eventually will meet Hines.<br /><br />From now on this incident, Taylor starts to build an agile script without never falling into commonplaces. The innovative naturalness,the dance sequences collide respect the opressive regime until the boiling point be reached.<br /><br />Don't miss this solid thriller.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I love these headphones.  The PX21's were a Father's Day gift from my wife so I could stay up late and play games without waking the baby or having to play with no sound.  They are very comfortable.  I have not worn them longer than a two hour gaming session, but I don't see them getting uncomfortable.  Sound is very crisp and you can for sure hear foot steps in CoD:Black Ops.  Love having that detail.  I do with that I had just went ahead and got a pair of 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound headphones though.  Having that extra bit of sensory help is probably worth the $80 in price difference.  If you are in my boat (of having a small child), these are a must recommend if you are just looking for a good set of stereo headphones.  They work for Xbox 360, PC and PS3.  Though I had to run an extra set of wires from my PS3 since it is connected HDMI and these headphones need to run through the stereo A/V jacks.  This is just a matter of extra clutter, and does not really bother me (too much stuff hanging off the back is just a way of life...).
159514188X|5.0|This book was so intricately written with such good detailing that i felt swallowed in the story. I could feel the what the characters were feeling, as I flew through the book. Also \\"Thirteen reasons why\\" isn't like any other book i've read. It has a new, and refreshing plot, although melancholy.  I strongly recommend reading this heartfelt book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A masterpiece by Adele (21).  A vocal tour de force that combines the power of K D Lang, the soulful-blues of Bonnie Raitt and the emotional heartbreak of Janis Joplin.  An album with great songs that I believe rivals the best of singer-songwriters since the '70s.  The Grammy might as well give her best album of the year now.  Adele has blown away any competition from Lady Gaga, Katy Perry or Beyonce.    Two of my favorite songs, Rumour Has It and Turning Tables, were co-written by One Republic's lead singer, Ryan Tedder.  For me, a nice surprise from another fav group.  Rumour Has It is a blast on a big sound system and should make the club scene.  While Rolling in the Deep has become a big hit, it does share similar DNA to KT Tunstall's Black Horse and the Cherry Tree (which is a very good thing).  The remaining songs are stunningly intimate.      Adele has brought back to the pop music scene, the vocalist, who can stand alone in front of a microphone, without having 100 dancers in the background, and electrify the audience.  Wow!
B000000SDB|4.0|Paradoxically, Nikolaus Harnoncourt manages to bring forth a typically idiosyncratic reading of Beethoven's symphonies without sounding extreme in any direction.  These 1990 recordings were based on extensive research and knowledge of historically informed practice (HIP), no surprise given his expertise in the baroque and classical repertoire as well as his intellectual approach (see for instance the added disc to his [[ASIN:B0000AF1IG Bruckner 9th]] exploring a reconstruction of the incomplete fourth movement.)<br /><br />Though the Chamber Orchestra of Europe uses HIP techniques such as minimized vibrato, it plays modern instruments, and while Harnoncourt's readings can be quirky and/or revelatory in many passages, the timings are not lightning-fast as with some HIP performances.  In general this is a very sober traversal which makes me wonder why it caused such a brouhaha on its release.  I am glad to have added it to my collection because Harnoncourt's take is *interesting,* not because Harnoncourt's take is overall the best Beethoven.

He had what he called a \\"Beethoven-Problem,\\" a \\"deep inner resistance\\" to performing Beethoven that persisted into the 1980s because of how he had seen the music misused in his youth, its elements of \\"the will to conquer and the demand for power\\" utilized to manipulate the masses (from Monika Mertl's liner notes).  Apparently Harnoncourt finally came to hear Beethoven differently via Schubert, and worked backward from Schubert's apprecation of and reaction to Beethoven to finally reach his own.  He had to consciously \\"purge his interpretation of all that is unthinkingly heroic.\\"<br /><br />My [[ASIN:B000095IUM 2003 reissue of this 5-disc set]] comes in a cumbersome fold-out jewel box which is not as elegant as a Brilliant-style box, but it does include a 120-page booklet with 30 pages of commentary in English, including an interview with Harnoncourt.sc set]] comes in a cumbersome fold-out jewel box which is not as elegant as a Brilliant-style box, but it does include a 120-page booklet with 30 pages of commentary in English, including an interview with Harnoncourt.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|One Republic's \\"Waking Up\\" was a refreshing surprise. Brilliantly written modern urban-rock songs that demonstrate rock is not going to die quietly. In fact, I believe One Republic has set the standard to how modern rock should be played today.  Each song brings an interesting concept to the listener; with enough twists and diversity that balances the musical hooks just enough to keep the CD on the art-rock side of the equation rather than candy-pop.      The song tracks blend into each other, very much like a concept album; but, there is an inconsistent sound production throughout the CD.  Not as bad as Brian Eno's miserable production qualities (IMO) heard on Coldplay or U2.  In those recordings, the vocals are buried into the music.  One Republic's singer, Ryan Tedder, can be clearly heard.    The first time I heard \\"Good Life\\" was on \\"The Voice,\\" when Tedder sang it with contestant Beverly McClellan and I loved the song along with their performance.  Another side note, Ryan Tedder co-wrote two great songs on Adele's 21 CD (Rumour Has It and Turning Tables).  He is a superb songwriter.
B00354YA4U|5.0|I read this book in one sitting and it is a spectacular book. It's a short book but it packs so much emotion into such a short span of space and time.  The book centers around a young English couple approaching their honeymoon night in the early 1960s. Much of the book takes place in the couples' heads. I was drawn to this book because that one night represents a sort of microcosm of marriage itself. Like so many couples married for many years, there is very little interpersonal communication.  In fact even if either of them had displayed even a little courage to speak out about their fears and desires, many of their problems could have been resolved. Read this on a nice rainy day, with a good beverage.  It's a deeply reflective book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Carolyn Moncel, author of [[ASIN:1453898212 Encounters in Paris: A Collection of Short Stories]]

B004A8ZX2S|1.0|I went in with mixed emotions having in mind that the audience in Cannes didn't receive it well, yet was awarded with the \\"Palm d'Or\\".    After sitting through half this long movie I was only anxiously waiting for it to end.  Unnecessarily long, that is. Embellished with never-ending pictures of erupting volcanos and semi-philosophical/theological words from the off that rather cut the story than serve as a transition. I haven't seen a more boring movie in a long time.    If I want to see a nature movie I stick to National Geographic; in the cinema I'd rather had a story told.    No I cannot be merciful with this movie and understand the audience in Cannes very well!
B003Y5H59W|5.0|Okay I just got back from the midnight showing of this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fairly faithful to the origins created in the Marvel Comics, although of course there were some minor changes. Now I am not going to give away any real spoilers, but I will give you a few teasers for you to enjoy and whet your appetite before you go and view this movie for yourself.<br /><br />This movie follows Steve Rogers from the start as he tries to join the military during World War II, but is always being denied due to his small stature and basically weak and frail body, although his spirit is second-to-none as you will see. However during the 1943 World's Fair, he is overheard talking about his desire to join the military and is given a miraculous opportunity which will lead to him being created as Captain America, which is initially merely a glorified \\"chorus girl\\" as is so aptly put by consummate actor, Tommy Lee Jones, who portrays the Colonel in charge of the super-soldier program. Cap finally gets his chance to fulfill his destiny while performing for the troops on the front lines during a USO show and it is from this point forward that the legend of Captain America as a truly heroic American hero begins.<br /><br />My only minor complaint with this movie was some futuristic weapons that were created during the time-period by Hydra and the Red Skull, but with the cosmic cube playing a pivotal role in the story, I guess I can overlook that particular point.<br /><br />Chris Evans did a superb job as Captain America as well as very good performances by Stanley Tucci and a special nod to Hugo Weaving who plays the Red Skull and who I personally believe should always play dark sinister characters as he does them oh so well.<br /><br />Be sure and pay close attention to some of the rescues GI's and see if you recognize any of them. Also, be sure and stay for a cool sneak preview of \\"The Avengers\\" movie after ALL of the credits role by.

1422161978|5.0|\\"Those businesses that relegate themselves to the diminishing world of goods and services will be rendered irrelevant. To avoid this fate, you must learn to stage a rich, compelling experience.\\"     This statement from authors Joe Pine and Jim Gilmore is one, that if heeded, can help virtually any business avoid the commoditization of their offerings--a downward spiral, which ultimately leads to irrelevance. I recently read the updated version of \\"The Experience Economy\\" (following 15 readings of the original version). As I immersed myself in the pages, I was deeply impressed with the way in which the authors were able to retain the integrity of the original book, while expanding on existing examples of experience stagers, and adding new, dynamic examples of companies who have transitioned from selling goods and delivering services--to staging experiences. They have done an incredible job of \\"refreshing\\" the experience for this reader and practioner of their work.     The updated edition is an appropriate \\"Act II\\" to the original TEE[[ASIN:0875848192 The Experience Economy: Work Is Theater & Every Business a Stage]], which was named one of the 100 Best Business Books of All Time by CEO Reads[[ASIN:B002BWQ56I The 100 Best Business Books of All Time: What They Say, Why They Matter, and How They Can Help You]]. This refreshing reading experience is available in soft cover, or electronically. I've taken turns reading the printed page, as well as on my Kindle and iPad2.     If you are a business leader, and feel that your offerings are losing their uniqueness and value--read this book! If you want to be challenged to change your thinking about how business can and should be done in the 21st Century, this is a \\"must read\\", and an apt reminder that \\"Work IS INDEED Theatre & Every Business a Stage\\".

1400119170|4.0|My father in law is an Oncologist, and is notoriously hard to shop for.  We bought him the audio version of this book so he could listen to it in his car.  He is a big fan of history, and he loved this book.  He learned things that he had never known about the history of cancer.  While I didn't read this book, it apparently succeeded in captivating the interest of an expert in the field.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it seemed disingenuous to do so when I never read the book myself.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Sturdy plastic attachment that provides some lens protection if you knock your camera around a lot.  For a few comparison shots I've done, I can't tell a lot of difference in the photographs taken with or without, but it does provide some protection for the lens surface (and doesn't seem to impact most photographs negatively if you just leave it on all the time.)   I envision that it will make a difference when photographing around water in bright sun.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is the best jazz album ever.  No questions.  The music is extremely melodic and the playing is incredibly epic.  The album is extremely easy to listen to with no exotic experimental stuff, and this endears it to jazz newcomers.  But this does not mean that the players do not demonstrate their abilities.  And the players are all fantastic...backing Miles you have Coltrane, Cannonball, Evans, Cobb and Chambers.       This remastered/rereleased version has the speed at the correct level; previous versions had been mastered at the wrong tape speed.      This album HAS been highly rated and hyped.  There is a reason why.  It should really be part of every collection and for me is one of the desert island discs.      A must have!!!

0439023491|5.0|Suspenseful, throughout. Every chapter ends on its own mini cliffhanger and begs you to progress further. I can only imagine because this is the middle of the series, it's all juicy plot with little background or filler. I have a pet peeve for redundancy however, and having begun reading Catching Fire immediately after the Hunger Games, the author's choice to include miniature re-explanations of things that were explained fully in the first book is maddening. That said, the characters are very well fleshed out and the action is ever present. Her struggle against the dangers of the Capitol puts you in a constant state of fear for her and her loved ones. The science-fiction aspects, are never overdone; this is the future, but the story is not about the future or the technology, it just adds some spice to the scenario. Collins has caught me off guard several times throughout the series, and there's nothing like being genuinely surprised to please someone who thinks they've read everything. Like the first one there's some mildly visceral violence but nothing that makes it inappropriate for readers 13 and up. There's a subtle love story in here, and Katniss' tomboy nature means that it plays out in a way that is not at all unappealing for the sci-fi nerd or action lover. It fits into the heart of the story without being sappy, which is the first time I've encountered a love story that wasn't oozing over every word to the point of nausea. I'm looking forward to the conclusion of the series and the film(s) when they arrive. Great story, great book.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I never thought that I would find something better or faster than swype, but after only one of day, I'm already faster at typing with SwiftKey. The predictive text is really amazing, and it's certainly worth either $4 or a free download. I was a skeptic at first, but am definitely sold on it! Highly recommended.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Ah..Swiftkey X, I have been beta testing you for quite some time. You were quite buggy but, low and behold: Amazon has your non beta form free! :) I couldnt install the english language pack until i uninstalled the beta version. No problem there. Then I did the usual business where you pry into my language lingo and learns which words i use the most and predict what im soon going to say. A little creepy but, its okay. I change my input method to swiftkey and get to texting.   Now let it be known i have a G2 and i can easily flip my phone horizontally and flip it for a physical keyboard. Which, is what i do 85% of the time. However there are those occasions where I need to send a text with one hand and well....Swiftkey is okay but its just not as natural as Swype. I can easily text faster with Swype by lazily dragging my thumb across the virtual keyboard than typing half a word and selecting the word from the list. Be that as it may, im more of a precise texter so speed and precision is what I aim for the most.  Thats not to say that Swiftkey X isn't fast or can be precise. Its just that i'm used to Swypes speed and the way it handles texting. If you're an avid Tweeter and Facebooker (something I'm not these days) Swiftkey X can possibly be your new best friend predicting your every word.  Despite my personal preference and the fact that Swiftkey X beta was buggy for the G2. I say if you dont have a physical keyboard or if you dont like Swype give Swiftkey X a shot. Its worth it, especially if you're an avid social networker and texter. Once it learns your texting pattern you shouldn't have any issues with it. Also be aware that Swype 3.0 is beta testing, so if you're curious give that a try as well. Overall, I say if you text beyond 5000 texts a month and you love the social networking scene and you lack a physical keyboard, heck even if you have a physical keyboard give Swiftkey X and chance.
B00518HBD0|3.0|I own all the 3 Doors Down cds prior to this and have enjoyed each. I noticed when the band released Seventeen Days, that there was a very similar formula to all their songs. I was ok with this at first because lyrically the songs are quite strong usually. I was skeptical about purchasing their self titled album, but gave in due to a number of strong tracks. After hearing \\"When You're Young\\", I was pretty much convinced that unless the cd had at least 6 strong tracks, it wouldn't be a purchase for me. The formula was still there and had finally worn thin for me and I needed a strong case in order to warrant a purchase. After listening to the cd on Music Unlimited on my PS3 (A killer feature for listening to alot of new releases without having to pay), the cd just doesn't do it for me. There are a few keepers in \\"Time Of My Life\\", \\"Heaven\\", and \\"My Way\\", but there is too much here that just feels like filler. If you're a diehard 3 Doors Down fan then this will probably sit well with you and that's fine. Brad Arnold is a great lyricist and for that reason I give the disc a 3 star, but the band needs a different formula musically. So unless something changes in that department, the self titled will be my last 3 Doors Down purchase.
032147404X|5.0|I'm an intermediate photographer - product, sports and event photography. I've even done several weddings! A graphic artist by trade for over 20 years. The book is fun and entertaining -  the tips and suggestions the author provides are more than worth the price paid.  He covers Canon and Nikon with easy to follow directions and suggestions.  He provides 3 levels of suggestions for those of us who don't have a large wallet for any purchases mentioned!  He even suggested a couple tips in Photoshop I didn't know about!! Great for newbies and intermediate folks who want to get better in the field of digital photography.

030746363X|5.0|I'm writing this review because I'm grateful to the author for writing this book.  He has a lovely approach to self improvement.  The book is smart, very well researched, collaborative (i.e. it's not a book that foregrounds his own genius but his genius for working with others), and it is *effective* as all get-out.  I mean, I can't believe how great some of this advice is!  But what I find profound about it about it is the generous ground on which it's based--it seeks to empower people and to make people's lives better.  Most weight loss/muscle-y books are profoundly oriented around SELF-improvement -- as in the SINGLE the INSULAR the ONE.  This book and the accompanying website feel like a big party where everyone's invited and everyone has something to offer.  The approaches are all open-ended too...you don't get the sense that the experiment is over.  You have the feeling we're all researchers here and we're in this together and that even though he's compiled a few amazing levers that make some aspects of life that are famously tricky and difficult  (like feeling vibrant and controlling one's weight)  feel really easy (or at least within one's control), there is still room for improvement. Too, I think his heart is in the right place--and I think the fact that a lot of the book's info is free (online) and a lot of key proceeds (from product placement etc) go to his education non-profit are testament to that fact.

0316044695|4.0|Without the controversy on the very few political statement of the author, I am sure the overall rating of this book will be even higher, with the excellent writing to let readers know the very tough training and combat situation facing those elite warriors of the world, who are simply physically and mentally mighty. A very good read indeed! Highly recommended!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages in my most favorite chapter 3 to 5 about the SEALs training for your reference.<br />The body can take damn near anything. It's the mind that needs training. The question that guy was being asked involved mental strength. Can you handle such injustice? Can you cope with that kind of unfairness, that much of a setback? And still come back with your jaw set, still determined, swearing to God you will never quit? That's we're looking for. pg 102<br />That's a big part of becoming a SEAL. We need proof you can take the punishment. And the way out of that is mental, in your mind. Dont buckle under to the hurt, rev up your spirit and your motivation, attack the courses. Tell yourself precisely how much you want to be here. pg103<br />First of all, I do not want you to give in to the pressure of the moment. Whenever you're hurting bad, just hang in there. Finish the day. Then, if you're still feeling bad, think about it long and hard before you decide to quit. Second, take it one day at a time. One evolution at a time. Dont let your thoughts run away with you, dont start planning to bail out because you're worried about the future and how much you can take. Dont look ahead to the pain. Just get through the day, adn there's a wonderful career ahead of you. - speech to Class 226 by ex SEAL, Rear Admiral Maguire pg124.
0553801473|2.0|He accomplishes close to NOTHING in this book. It seems like he's decided to write more books so he was biding plot lines and time in this one.........He makes Danaerys look whiny and I really don't need or want to hear a day by day account of Jon's troubles with food and morale blah blah blah. The plot \\"addition\\" only subtracts from the intriguing previous story. If not for Tyrions story I would have given it one star. CAN'T WAIT FOR 6 YEARS TO BE UP FOR THE NEXT ONE..........hopefully it is much much better than this sophmoric attempt.
B0050PLT8W|1.0|Over the years Theory of a Deadman's albums kept getting better, until this one. The only song on it worth listening to is \\"Out Of My Head\\". I do like 2 Bonus tracks from the Deluxe Edition, \\"Does It Really Matter\\" & \\"Better Or Worse\\". They are better than any of the original album tracks. What a disappointment! I only hope they do better on the next album.
B003Y5H542|2.0|Great beginning. Predictable bad ending. okay for 11 year kids. Mild western/cartoon action and brief cursing. More than mediocre.

030726999X|5.0|Larsson will be missed by generations of readers.  His writing style is packed with detail that often seems extraneous at the moment but becomes vital to the plot later.  He develops characters so well that I could visualize not only their appearance but mannerisms and habits.  He writes with purpose, nothing is injected that later doesn't have an impact on the plot.  I must admit, since I'm not familiar with Sweden the names and locations slowed my reading until I learned to glaze over that, but he is so compelling I find myself rationing my reading of this, the last trilogy of the Dragon Tatoo books, because I just don't want it to end.  Are the books historical fiction?  Are they political intrigue?  Adventure? Psychological thrillers? Love stories? For me, they are all of the above.  As I miss more novels from Gary Jennings and James Clavell, I already miss more from Steig Larsson.  As they did, he writes a tightly woven spellbinding tale.  A must read!
0553801473|2.0|It saddens me to say this, but GRRM has fallen from the throne of the best writer. Where the first three books were pieces of art, A Dance with Dragons, just like its predecessor, represents a continued downward spiral of a once great series. I absolutely cannot understand how an author with consistent good writing, in first three books, can mess up so badly. Suffice it say, I found myself skipping through the book. The book was too long and accomplished too little. The POV characters seem to be frozen in time while we are reading about other POV characters. It is safe to say that GRRM has hit a writer's block because only that can explain this disaster of a book. I say disaster because I had high expectations from GRRM, honestly speaking, this was an average fantasy book but it doesn't deserve to be in the same series as a Game of thrones, Feast for Crows and Storm of Swords. All I have left to say is that its high time to let this dying horse to be put out of its misery.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|This keyboard replacement is marginally better than the stock keyboard. It's predictive text feature is somewhat useful -- particularly if you use similar phrases frequently in texts and social networking -- but fairly gimmicky.  The real problem, though, is in just how much of a resource hog this app is. Running on my Droid-X1 with just one language installed, it eats 33 megs of memory and noticeably slowly and stutters my device.  I'm sticking with FlexT9, which has similar features but uses just 6 megs of RAM.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Depending on what camera and lens you use this on has a lot to do with how well it works.  I have a Fujifilm s200exr advanced point and shoot that has a 14x zoom.  Since it's a fixed lens camera the only choices I had were the 1, 2 or 3x filters or the Raynox.  I chose the 250 over the 150 because I wanted the most magnafication possible.  Like everyone else has pointed out this lens has a very shallow DOF but even so I have been able to get some real nice shots hand holding the camera.  After seeing how well the lens works I am considering picking up the 150 to add to my bag of tricks.  I have also used this on my Canon Xsi dslr (55-250mm lens) with good results.  It's nice to have one lens that works on multiple cameras.  Next I will try it on my 35mm slr's,  I don't see why it won't work there as well.  In my opinion for the money you can not go wrong with this lens.  The spring loaded mounting system works on multiple size lens without step up or step down rings and hold securely.
B001QWBM62|3.0|I purchased the Zoom H4N back in January 2011. For the money, it has plenty of features and great sound and pickup although it takes a long time to boot up. Unfortunately Samson Tech's warranty repair in the USA is slow and out of touch with the needs of professionals. The line-out jack was probably intermittent from the start, but I missed that until Amazon's return period had ended. Thus I had to send it back to Samson Tech for warranty repair, which has a disappointingly long turn-around time of 4-8 weeks with no advanced replacement available. To top that off, it took them an additional week after receipt of the unit to get it from the receiving dock and into the repair queue.          This same service delay would also apply to all products sold and serviced by Samson Tech in the USA, as I was told their microphone products have an even longer turn-around time. Get in touch with reality Samson, professionals need to have predictable and quick service. If that can't be offered, at least offer the option of paying a reasonable fee for an advance replacement, or swap of units. Many other top-notch companies offer this type of warranty swap as a way to keep customers happy despite the long internal service turn-around times.
0140277447|4.0|I have been wanting to read this book for quite some time. The atrocities the Japanese unleashed on the people of Nanking in 1937 is incomprehensible. What is even more disturbing is many of the perpetrators went unpunished and some even went on to the highest posts of government after the close of WWII.<br /><br />Japan has never really owned up to their war crimes as a society either. There is a hardcore group of right-wingers (Liberal Democrats over there imagine that) who are very vocal, physical even, in their denouncement of public figures who are so brazen as to say the Chinese atrocities were Emperor Hirohito's fault. The actions are barely mentioned in the Japanese classroom and weren't at all until the 1990s.<br /><br />The Rape of Nanking and the treatment of the northern Chinese in general is the forgotten holocaust of WWII. More studies should be made of this time period and more books need to be written. In a previous review ([[ASIN:0465002390 Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin]]) I was convinced the Ukrainians were the most horribly oppressed people of the 20th century. I still believe that to be true but no locality every witnessed atrocities comparable to what the people of Nanking endured...at least not since the time period of the marauding Mongols at least.<br /><br />The only reason why I gave this story 4 stars is because Chang is obviously not a professional historian. Call me a snob but I have read so many historical books that I've become accustomed to highly polished writing. Many have given this book 5 stars.

I would give it five stars if it suspended when I open my phone.

B003JTHSE0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was recomened to me by a friend who said it was her favorite movie of all time. I'm not sure about the movie being the best, but the book is a fast paced rags to riches story full of suprising twists and turns. I couldn't put it down. The book does not follow the movie so if you've seen the movie get ready for a few suprises!
0553801473|5.0|Many of the other comments are correct in that the book may not have fulfilled everyone's hopes--that is, the book leaves us with  a huge number of loose-ends. They might be forgetting though, that this novel is not actually a stand-alone story, but rather the second part to book four (more or less). Indeed, Martin excels in that the story doesn't progress in an easily predictable manner, its disjointed nature keeps us guessing. Whereas I've been able to roughly predict the future of various factions from his past books, I feel woefully incapable of doing so at the conclusion of ADWD. FFC began the devolution of the uneasy peace, and ADWD shattered that trend into a downward spiral. Every faction has decided to make its move. When everyone's playing we don't know who will survive.
B005DD7H50|5.0|If you are reading reviews to determine whether or not to buy or rent this movie, then my advice is simple: go for it! The concept is absolutely fascinating. In a nutshell, the protagonist starts taking a pill that drastically enhances his mental capacities and he becomes super smart/cool. One thing that makes this movie effective is that you feel like you are in the main character's shoes, experiencing everything right along with him.     I also appreciated the way that it ended, though it was a wee bit unclear (I won't spoil it for you). Frequently, movies that have powerful premises in the beginning tend to fizzle by the end, but this one didn't. It was great, and I loved the fact that I couldn't predict it.     Overall, it was very entertaining, and I am stoked to watch it again.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best app so far. You can literally type sentences with only a few letters. This app is reading my mind!!!!
B000HZD08M|5.0|How I missed this production for five years means it's time for me to leave the cave. The three consistent criticisms, from what I read, were that the costuming was poorly conceived and I would disagree somewhat given how difficult it is and historically has been to portray dress codes that far into the future so why not at least promote Charlize's physical attributes. Second, that the movie isn't faithful to the written comic book series is a common argument for all similar transferences from the printed page to the screen and most viewers regard that as a moot point as the mediums are, in the first place, so different and, secondly, how a story is expressed should be independent in the two mediums. Third, that the forest outside the city was poorly conceived and I say, so what, as the forest was largely superfluous to the main direction of the story.     Digression aside, I principally look for creative storytelling in movies including the plot, the props, the sets, the cinematography, the editing/directing, the acting and this movie succeeded on all those criteria.  The story had a moralistic and intellectual theme; the props were visually period appropriate and well conceived; the sets were uniquely futuristic in design and function; the props such as Aeon's rotating eye and modes of communication were all interesting and novel; the camera work contributed to making this alternative dynamic world come across as somewhat realistic and the acting was solid enough. Finally, I noticed that the director's cutting edge work went a little under appreciated. So, director kudos, but a few years late, for delivering an entertaining and thought provoking futuristic action flick. It would have been interesting to have seen you continue your work in this genre.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been a VIP user for awhile.  Was miffed we didn't get this for free since we tested it. KUDOS to Amazon for providing it as a free app of the day!  It truly is a great keyboard on the EVO 4G.
B0055FR5PS|4.0|This was quite enjoyable.  Nothing new from a story side, but well acted for an alien action movie and a great musical score.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Easy to type with one hand.  It looks great, not to heavy on the eyes.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I absolutely love my Beatles box set, but I definitely recommend that you buy from Amazon rather than a third party seller.  There are a lot of Beatles bootlegs out there, and you want to be sure to get the real thing!<br />My favorites are Abbey Road, Revolver and The White Album, but I love them all.  I could not be happier with this purchase. :)
0316056863|4.0|I'm pretty biased when it comes to Tina Fey, because as my title indicates, she's pretty much my hero.  I found a lot of good advice/anecdotes that pertain to me as I'm trying to succeed at Second City & improv like she did.  That being the case, I wish she wrote more about SNL and Second City.  I really liked the stuff she did write on those topics, and her early life chapters.  I thought the Palin bits were especially interesting.    SUCH a quick read - well written.  I \\"couldn't put it down!\\"
B001CTDH76|4.0|I love the mentalist, each show is great.  It was the packaging I was disappointed in.  When I took the first season out of the box I could hear something rattling around.  When I opened it the binding that holds the discs in was broken.  I was surprised you let this item go out.
0553801473|2.0|I'll make this short - the writing is as brilliant as ever and the characters feel very real, almost human. However, there is no excuse for a book with over 1000 pages in which absolutely nothing happens. I don't feel that I need more new characters and more points of view, especially since they don't seem to be very interesting. I found myself skimming whole chapters just to see if GRRM felt liked resolving at least one storyline. Alas, the only one resolved was of a minor character, at the end of the book, whose fate left me feeling ambivalent at best.<br /><br />If after 5 years of creative writing this is what GRRM has managed to produce then I feel sorry for him. And for his readers.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Bones is a wonderful TV Series and have it in my home 24/7 just makes it that much better!!!  I recommend this and other seasons to everyone... go for it and get under the skin!
6304539282|1.0|Because, if you haven't figured it out after watching his schlocky but deathstar-cheeseball good space western, which rose to greatness in ESB with the help of a real screen writer, before then proceeding down the long disintegration from bad writing and dopey plots (ROTJ) to stupid, pointless characters like Jar Jar that were apparently as amusing to George as they'd be to the average 8 year old, to the sterile violence of the the droid wars with idiotic character names like Count Dookie and Generally Grevious and Darth Sidious (oh, yeah, let's trust him) with yet more pointless droid carnage, to the casting of Darth Vader as whiny little bipolar b*tch, then let me spell it out:     George is a total hack who has no idea how he got lucky, and he's been one since DAY ONE, but he can't admit that, just like he can't admit that he took a giant dump all over the franchise with his laughably bad I, II, and III.  Why wouldn't your fans want to see Jabba suddenly appear in IV for a completely pointless conversation?  or troopers riding big random animals?  Or bigger explosions, ala Michael Bay? That's really cool you see.  ...And for the children, Gredo must shoot first, because that would send the wrong message or something 5 minutes after Obi Wan slices off some pig dude's arm.  If he releases the originals he admits that his efforts to \\"improve\\" the originals were worthless, and far worse, that he has no idea how to add value to his movies, or construct plots, characters, shoot action scenes, or write dialog.  And of course that's true, as anyone can see.
B005BW1IEE|5.0|I have been a big fan of this group since their debut & they still sound great. I like the fact that every one of their albums has a different sound and feel to it. Time of My Life is no exception. From the power ballad, Back To Me, to the energetic track Believer, this album has a little bit of everything for the music lover in you. If you're a big fan of these guys, I highly recommend this album. You won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This wasn't a bad second book to the serious. The book has a few interesting turn of events that make it worth the read. The only downside is that a few parts are drawn out. Suzanne is a great story teller, but at times I felt like I was reading parts from the first book again. Good read for sitting at the pool
B0038W0OHQ|2.0|First of all - the good. The headset is actually very nice - comfortable, very good sound profile (coming from a very old Sony MDR-7509, I didn't notice a huge difference). The microphone is crystal clear and great for gaming, Skype, whatever.    That being said, I am now on my *third* set. Like other reviewers have noted, there is an issue with the build quality with the 7Hs regarding the middle connector piece (both headphones are detachable from this middle piece, for easy storage/packing). This bridge will simply fail over time - both of mine suffered from the right side simply cutting out when I would put them on my head a few months into use. They would work fine without being stretched.    SteelSeries support is great, but when I had the second failure in a row, all they did was apologize and ship me a new headset. They don't seem to acknowledge this is a manufacturing defect. At this point, I'm wondering if it is even worth contacting them to get a fourth headset.    I have other SteelSeries products I love - a keyboard and a Xai laser mouse - but stay away from this headset.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is very entertaining and great at keeping the readers attention. I did feel a little like Mad Max meets Twilight in some areas.....However, that being said and out of the way, I believed this was a great first book to kick off a trilogy. Well done!
0345529057|5.0|Before the premiere of HBO's Game of Thrones I had not known of this author or this series. The TV series proved to be enthralling so, after the season ended, I decided to buy the books and read them all before season 2 premieres in April of 2012.   I'm currently on the 3rd book in The Song of Ice and Fire collection and have to say, I cannot put them down.  George R.R. Martin writes with such detail that the scenes are vivid in your mind as you read. These books are captivating!   Even if you have no interest in the genre of medieval fantasy, these books still draw you in and make you a fan of the author.  I am hoping that he continues to write more in this series so that we'll always have something to look forward to.
B001QG4LVG|5.0|I was fortunate to find a good condition, hardcover copy of this book for pennies at a local thrift store.  Although I had always been vaguely aware of the genocide of Native Americans, Dee Brown encapsulates the historic details without fluff or bias, jam packing this tight narrative with quotations, observations, facts and figures that will leave you astounded.  The photos and illustrations are worth the price alone of admission into this neglected tragedy of How the West Was Won.  My only criticism is that Brown mainly deals with the plains Indians and scarcely mentions the eastern and midwest tribes that were eradicated before the middle of the 19th century.  But all you have to do is project backwards in the time line because only the names, dates and faces changed.  American colonial policy was consistent from the beginning, the goal being to eliminate and/or subdue native Americans for their land and resources.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Overall it was a pretty good book. It started off kind of slow for me and at one point I questioned whether it'd be worth it to keep reading. However, I was proven wrong. Once I got passed the slow, repetitive descriptions of what goes on in the room, I began rooting for Jake and his Ma's freedom. If you are interested in books about human relationships or characters dealing with a life changing moment- it's the book for you.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|There was some good stuff on 2001's \\"Magnification,\\" so when I heard there was a new Yes album coming out I went ahead and picked it up. I should make it clear that Yes was my favorite band for my teenage years and early twenties. The albums between \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Going For The One\\" are like a musical security blanket for me, and their second wind of \\"90120\\" and \\"Big Generator,\\" though they felt like a different band, also got a lot of play at my house. While everything since has seemed increasingly hit-or-miss, mostly miss, \\"Magnification\\" made me think that there was hope Yes would recapture some of their former glory.    This record dashes those hopes. It has none of the fire or inventiveness of either of their stronger periods: it's full of cliche music delivered without conviction. It sounded like they spent the last twenty years listening to all those awful nu-prog bands that never had a fraction of their talent, and are now doing a pastiche of a bad copy of themselves. The fact that the main featured 'suite' started life as a Buggles demo should be all the warning you need. Add to this that the junior varsity singer has a distracting accent and absolutely no style, and you have a record that I listened all the way through once, and never will again. Hearing it just made me sad.
B00004RE7E|5.0|The best I can say is that this movie should be in everybodies DVD colection, that likes   SCI-FI.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I discovered this album entirely by chance -- I was in a book store where they were playing it, and had to ask about the music.    I'm not a fan of classical music or cellos, but this music grabbed me, immediately. It's all songs you know, but played only on cellos. It's different, but it's a very good kind of different.    Do yourself a favor -- go to YouTube, and see their videos for Smooth Criminal and Welcome to the Jungle. If those two tracks don't convince you to buy this album, then nothing will!
B003ELY7IS|4.0|This book tells of a perfectionist, a consummate professional and entertainer who studied intensely the greats before him (Grace Kelly, Fred Astaire, James Brown, Sammy Davies Jnr to name a few) and improved and improvised on their styles to come up with his very own.    What I take from this book:  - Believe in yourself no matter what and do not accept any limits from anybody about what you can and cannot do. There are no limits!  - There is no substitute for hard work. Talent and potential are not enough on their own.  - If you are going to succeed in your career/ field, you need to be thoroughly knowledgeable with your area, its history and what has been done thus far and master it, then you can work on improving upon it. (Stand on the shoulders of giants!)  - A work-life balance is critical if one is to have a fulfilling life.
0618918248|5.0|I found this book to be a clear and simple statement of my own beliefs, doubts, and questions. From the very beginning of the book with a definitive and concise definition of \\"delusion,\\" I feel like he tackled many philosophies of dieties and religions that I have found utterly ridiculous and implausible at best. Having been a neuroscience researcher, I found the purely scientific chapters easy to grasp although some more science-challenged might not. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for reasoned ideas for not believing in gods or religions.
B005BDZN62|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and it is still very stirring.     I just saw an outdoor, singalong presentation on a perfectly hot and sweaty July night in Brooklyn, New York. The WSS-heads were out in force and there weren't many dry eyes in the house by the end. Kinda cool when you're snapping your fingers or calling out \\"Mambo!\\" and \\"Krup You!\\" along with a thousand or so Friends.     The story and songs are timeless and beautiful. Bernstein's score is a gem, as is the choreography. I also get a kick out of seeing late 50's New York, though I have to admit most of those Broadway dancing / \\"gang members\\" wouldn't last very long on the streets nowadays!     My only problem now is that I just realized a DVD I picked up a few years ago is a horrible \\"Full screen\\" formatted version, and it looks pretty awful on my 46\\" HDTV. But coincidentally, Amazon just sent an email announcing the 50th anniversary blu-ray pre-release.     Thanks Daddy-O!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This being free is a steal! I'm loving this app! Really simple to use just follow the instructions and you will be okay.
0307474712|5.0|Several months ago, I purchased this novel. But it was only 3 weeks ago that I began to read it. From the moment I read the initial chapter which features the bedroom scene with Dexter (\\"Dex\\") and Emma (\\"Em\\") on the night after they both had graduated from university (July 15th, 1988), I WAS HOOKED. I developed such a deep empathy for both of them, though I was especially partial to Emma, who came from a humbler background compared to Dex.<br /><br />Nicholls' plot device of focussing on the lives of both Dex and Em through the prism of July 15th from 1988 was very clever. I liked being able to see how both their lives developed over time.<br /><br />As someone who graduated from college in 1986, I strongly identified with Dex and Em, because they are roughly of the same generation as myself. (There was one song that played itself in my mind like a refrain as I read deeply into this novel --- and it was, \\"SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD (Someone's Thinking of You)\\" by the UK band Swing Out Sister.)<br /><br />\\"One Day\\" is representative of the best novels that evoke a welter of emotions that will make the reader hearken back to his/her salad days and smile.
0698116496|5.0|Awesome book...there are so many things my daughter enjoys to do when reading this book. Whether it be naming all the colors on the keys, counting all the animals, tracking the balloon, figuring out what the mouse is doing different on each page, etc. Definitely a worthwhile purchase...I don't think most people will be disappointed.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I don't write reviews.  But this transmitter was pretty special so I thought I would give it a try.  It works as advertised ... you get good quality sound from your car's radio.  No more juggling CDs for me.  Just load up the mem card with songs and you will never run out of music during a drive.    The remote is very useful too.  It would be easy to misplace, however.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this at all the time! I'm in administration in education.   I use it to organize my notes, files and e-mails attached to various committees notes. I can store copies of blank forms and various graphs, flowcharts and calendars.  I used the Ever2One app to convert my  Evernotes into Onenote for storage.
0393339882|5.0|Quantum is an excellent book, highly recommended to anyone interested in an historical account of the development of the ideas behind Quantum Mechanics.  A nice combination of biography and the history of the ideas.  Readable, too.
0307277887|5.0|I have to say I wasn't a big reader, until I read this book. I love the t.v. series and thought I would try the book. Here I am hooked. It makes you root for the serial killer to the point you forget he is a bad guy. If you get this book make sure you have the next one ready because it's the kind of story you can't get enough of. If you actually watch the series there are no worries the book doesn't ruin it they are both great in their own way. It is a definite must read for any Dexter fan!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I have waited awhile to give this review, I give it 2 1/2 stars which you cant do on amazon. So here goes. I read the first two books with gausto I loved Katniss, she was strong and enduring the way that she saved her sister from the games. In comes Mockingjay.... Lets see Katniss run and hide and get doped up throughout the book then lets read about a huge amount of people dying and Katniss runs some more. You see slight glimpses of her old self in some passages of the book but not really. The way Suzanne Collins basicaly describes Katniss is selfish (as told through Gales and Pitas view). And then she has the freakin GAll to kill Primm (WHAT THE HELL) I mean really, REALLY. After all Katniss went through to save Primm from the Games she ends up dying from a bomb that Gale makes, and then ops for the Games to start again (one more time). It just makes my head spin and then Katniss goes nutts again... WOW So all in all I hated this book ruined the series for me RUINED it. I was so darn excited when this came out I read it in one day from front to back then it let me down terribly. But I will shut up now. I loved the first two books I really still do.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|The prediction accuracy is spot on and probably the best out there, but it needs more customization options, like the ability to insert commas without spaces and the ability to edit words after you've selected them. Add more options and this is easily five stars.
0345529057|5.0|Just as described. I love how it has photos from the show on the box itself but the books are the original covers.
006112429X|5.0|I am an avid reader and I have read many books. But I have to say that I have never read a book that made me think as much as this one.  I loved the way Lionel Shriver wrote this book.  She used many synonyms for common words.  I totally increased my vocabulary just by reading this book.  The plot of this story is excellent.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I strongly recommend this book to any parent.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Posted on my Facebook page that I had installed it without even asking I guess I should have read it closer. It is pretty good though so no need to uninstall. It is fun to pick the middle word over and over to see what my phone wants to say now!
B000XR4OC0|1.0|I was happy to see a corporation that was focused on giving to those in need. But my happiness was short-lived when I discovered that the company financially supports and is aligned with the Focus on the Family Organization which propagates hate and discrimination toward homosexuals. Giving shoes to the poor is not going to undo the damage that ongoing hate messages does in today's society.<br />We are all one family. We need to love one another and support each other. Spreading hatred feeds discrimination and hurts everyone. I will not support this company by buying their shoes when hatred is supported.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|to be honest of power android users, I seem to be of the few who really doesnt like swiftkey that much. the predictions aren't helpful and the keyboard is harder to type on than some. it's a great product that doesn't work for me.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used them all.. Swype, HTC keyboard, Android 2.2, Gingerbread Keyboard, T9flex    I give this keyboard 5stars and major props to the developers.

0061784788|2.0|I never thought I'd be saying I didn't care for a James Rollins' book, a Sigma Force book no less, but this one is not at all up to par with what Mr. Rollins  has thrilled us with before. Perhaps it was part of the hype used to increase sales, the country was founded by a lie etc etc etc. then the book wants to infer that the Mormons and their story as, before them 'ancient' Hebrew people founded N. America leaving their tablets. Come on. Usually the 'facts' included at the end of the novels are interesting and plausible but not with this book.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Cant even go through then main setup. It wont even let me install language packs then it always forces close whenever I atempt to try again. A lame waste of my time.

B001P9EQH8|3.0|This is a decent amp for 20 dollars, you basically get what you pay for.    the bass boost was good, but at higher volumes the amp produces a noticeable white noise.    I probably should have just saved up and bought a $50 or $200 amp instead.

0062060554|4.0|S.J. Watson's debut Before I Go to Sleep is a novel about forgetting, but one you won't soon forget. Main character Christine wakes up every day not knowing who she is, where she is, or who the man sleeping in bed beside her is. She wakes expecting to be in her early twenties (or younger) when, in reality, she's nearing fifty. The lines on her face and hands surprise her every time.<br /><br />Each night when Christine goes to sleep her memory is erased, reset; and each morning her husband, Ben, has to explain their life to her once again.<br /><br />After a violent accident years ago left her with amnesia, Christine is unable to remember things from day to day, leaving her entirely dependent on her husband.<br /><br />At her doctor's encouragement she starts a journal, writing down the day's events in a hope it will help jog her memory. But it's the words Christine finds on that journal one day, \\"Don't trust Ben,\\" that leave both her and the reader guessing.<br /><br />Can Ben really be trusted? Can Christine's transcription of events? Is everything that happened to Christine as it's been portrayed? Is everyone as they seem?<br /><br />What has happened to her memory . . . and will it ever return?<br /><br />Before I Go to Sleep is a novel full of twists and turns. It starts off being an interesting tale of a woman who cannot remember her life and gradually yearns more and more to have it back (sort of the grown up cousin to Forgotten) and then becomes more of a psychological thriller. The reader is left guessing just how much there really is to this story that at first could have seemed so simple (simple but strange).<br /><br />The last big twist is one readers might figure out themselves a bit before it's revealed but that will only add to the suspense as you wait for the events to ultimately unfold.<br /><br />Before I Go to Sleep is a novel you will, likely, want others to read if only so you can discuss with them what they thought of it or ask them questions about certain parts--it's not a talk about it novel.<br /><br />It is also an adult novel. For YA readers: Mostly due to the general plot and content but also to a few instances in language/scenes of sex. There's also some coarse language - but probably less than most YA novels.<br /><br />I will be looking for more from S.J. Watson in the future.also an adult novel.

0061784788|4.0|I really enjoy a novel when it makes you think and also makes you a little afraid. One could say that  \\"The Devil Colony\\" is a historical and sci-fi novel based on past and modern events with enough facts to have you doing research to separate fact from fiction. Also mixed in with this is the Sigma Force, a secret scientific investigative and enforcement unit of the U.S. Government. Their job is to investigate mysterious suicides and murders surrounded by environmental catastrophies.<br /><br />On the historical side, was Chief Canasatego of the Iroquois Nation one of the founding fathers of our government? Also was a Native American Federation suppose to be the Fourteenth Colony? Lastly, was a tribe of Israelites part of the Western Native American population?<br /><br />The author, James Rollins, gives this novel the best element of a good sci-fi thriller, the known mixed with the unknown. Everyone by now has heard of \\"nanotechnology\\". Do you think it existed in ancient times? Do you think that \\"nanorobots\\" exist that could destroy all matter it comes into contact with?<br /><br />You have to read this novel to even have a chance of answering these questions. You might want to have a pen and paper ready to start your research and help the \\"Sigma Force\\" save the world. Oh yeah, all of this is mixed in with an action packed thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B004IFYN2E|2.0|If this movie gets even a nomination in next year's Oscars it means the Academy is an open for bribery institution and I mean HEAVY BRIBERY, worse than FIFA.  The plot is interesting. You can suspect but you'll never know until the end of the movie. This is good. What is not good are the outcomes of the action scenes. Totally predictable and not believable. (I miss Bond).  JC on a stick!!! Is Jolie sick? She must be. I don't know, Anorexia nervosa perhaps? And they have the nerve to present her character as a sweeping sexy woman. I get more sexually aroused by a broomstick than from watching her character. She walks like a horse and I felt she was about to break any moment. Bad choice in casting. It would of been better to change a bit the script and do it without a female character.  Depp was good in movies like From Hell, The Ninth Gate and Secret Window. In this one there were too many bits of Pirates of the Caribbean. Steven Berkoff has always been good in this type of roles. One has only to remember him in Rambo and Beverly Hills Cop. Paul Bettany has a great future if he stops acting in movies like Priest. Timothy Dalton showed to be an actor of character even though he has always been criticized as a bad Bond. Small part but well played the one by Rufus Sewell. Don't miss him in the really bad series Pillars of the Earth.  Bottom line of any review. No matter if you agree or disagree with what you read. Watch the movie and then stick to your own opinion.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I have decided that NO ONE does a finer job producing DVD's than Warner Brothers. And this deluxe edition of \\"The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre\\" is a top-flight example.    Pristine picture and sound quality. This is Bogey at his best, and DVD at its best! If all that was included here was the movie itself, it's well worth the price!    But add to the movie a thoughtful, abundant, and thrilling array of extras...and you truly have, as the package proclaims, a night at the movies! I mean, what's better? A great and informative audio commentary, a wonderful portfolio of Bogart trailers, and even a priceless Warner Bros. cartoon (just to name a few items!). The extras are even introduced by Leonard Maltin, welcoming you to the night of fun!    I've only scratched the surface! Every video company/producer can learn from and hope to approach the Warner presentation of its catalogue. Awesome! If you are a Bogart fan, you MUST have this DVD. Absolutely this gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. (Also check out ALL of the other parallel Warner releases: \\"Adventures Of Robin Hood\\", \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\",etc... Top-drawer all the way!)
B004DMIIO6|1.0|Goemon is the same character as in the Shinobi no mono movies of the early 60s. It is light years away in quality and story.   Bacically this movie is heavy in CGI and action. So much of the movie is computer generated it makes the movie unbelivable. Almost   to the point of being disinterested in watching the ending. I suppose there is taste for 50 foot jumps and impossible fight scenes.   There are some great movies that have come out of Japan. This movie is more like candy as compared to a fine meal.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I discovered Josh Groban not too long ago. I went to his Straight to You tour in Chicago not too long ago, and I must say that listening to a CD doesn't compare to seeing him live in concert! The next best thing to actually being in the stadium at a concert is a DVD of it. The day after the concert I went on Amazon and found this DVD/CD combo, and I love it. Granted, they don't include all of the fun things that happen between songs, but watching him while he sings his songs is great! He has such a cute smile :)
076535618X|4.0|Rounding out a trilogy started with \\"Old Man's War\\", Scalzi takes on political questions.  Sent by the Colonial Union to head a colony, our narrator John Perry, his wife Jane Sagan, and their adopted daughter Zoe find that they've been given incomplete and inaccurate information about both the new colony and the circumstances surrounding it.  The politics are both local, as Perry's work to maintain fairness angers some of his colonists, and universal, as Perry does everything that he can to keep his colonists safe and this angers most of the Colonial Union.    The plot moves quickly.  It was hard to put down, and was a great end to the trilogy.  There's a young-adult novel, \\"Zoe's Tale\\", that tells the story from his daughter's perspective; I'm sure I'll pick it up in the future.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This app is good. It has a good word predictor but only shows 3 words at a time. The word predictor recognizes joined words that should have a space between them. The voice input gives you three choices. The voice input button is small, in addition to being a secondary function on the button - this is something I use often. For me, I'm not sure if it worth the large memory required. Definitely worth trying for free... Split between a 3 or a 4 rating.
B005AUWY2W|1.0|The music, the heart, the subtlety, the charm, the little humor, the details... everything that has brought Cars 1 into our hearts is unfortunately missing in this action-packed movie.

0553801473|2.0|Pretty disappointed with this one.  AFFC was tough to get through, but there was hope for redemption in the next installment of the series. Unfortunately, there isn't much of it in ADWD. The plot barely moved, the details overwhelmed me, and the story seems to have no direction.  I finished this feeling like I was still waiting for the 5th book to come out. GRRM had much better scope when his initial plans were to develop a 3 part series. Now that it's been increased to 7...well the negative reviews speak for themselves.<br /><br />That aside I still love the story, the characters, and the world he creates. His descriptions can be wonderful at times; so much detail that your imagination leaves little room for misinterpretation.  You truly see what he wants you to see.  Martin might be slipping in the most recent novels, but there is still a great story waiting to be told.  Here is hoping he finds his voice again.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Interestingly enough, my favorite action film has much less actual \\"action\\" than a traditional Hollywood movie. But that's because Luc Besson can find \\"action\\" in other elements besides pointing guns. The mind set of Leon, the life that Matilda comes from, the pacing, the shots... all add to an amazing experience following a hi tman and his tiny female fan through Manhattan.<br /><br />This particular DVD is packed with features too, which is wonderful. It has the full directors cut which includes a few extra scenes between Matilda and Leon. This is a DVD essential for action/thriller/drama fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an incredibly written YA Novel that will turn any reader into avid fans of Suzanne Collins. The story of Katniss and the tragic event that is the Hunger Games will make you wonder and fear a future like hers. The Hunger Games are a punishment for the families that went against the Capitol years ago....you must send a boy and a girl from each district into the area where the Hunger Games happen for the entertainment of the people of the Capitol. There are 12 Districts and only one winner...you do the math. Katniss turns out to be an unexpected contender in both the Games and in the story. I think anyone who is in for a change of pace in books will like this series. I bought them all in one day on my kindle and read this one in 2 days. Your fear for Katniss, Prim, Peeta, Haymitch, and Gale are real just as your love for them. I so enjoy a writer who can make you gasp at the \\"girl on fire\\" and cry at the death of a friend...it means that writer is brilliant and cares just as much as you.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I love everything David Fincher has done. Granted when I heard this was being done I got worried. But Fincher paired with Sorkin made an amazing thriller of a movie based on not much more than dialogue. The cinematography and pacing you'd expect from Fincher with the amazing dialogue you'd expect from Sorkin.<br /><br />And like all Fincher films on DVD this DVD is loaded with special features. Great for film students and film lovers a like.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|The music you will hear when listening to Florence & the Machine will surpass all others in your collection. They are brilliant, original, and a bit mystical. I absolutely love this album and would recommend it to everyone.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Miss Dugard's story is possibly the most horrible thing I have ever read.  She tells her story with such honesty and innocence that it is absolutely riveting.  I was drawn into her world of confusion and fear as she described her conflicting emotions about the Garrido's and her daily existence.  After reading her story, I have profound respect and admiration for this young woman who has survived such horrors while remaining so sane and positive in her outlook.  I could not put this book down.
B004KSQN7C|3.0|Okay, have always loved Britney but Circus was much better. I feel like...I don't know. I can tell you this...I wore out Circus and this one stayed in my player for about 2 weeks and I kept just playing two songs. If you like disco and her you will probably love it.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Gotta love it.. the big circle the end of a saga - or is it?  Not thrilled with the minial extras, but I loved it.
1439107955|5.0|This \\"biography\\" of cancer is a remarkable achievement.  The author presents the \\"life\\" of this so-far-unconquerable disease and human efforts to understand and treat it in a way which is both accurate and compelling.  I highly recommend this book as both a precise and comprehensive historical document and a compelling read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|overall very impressed with this application.  It knows what you want to say.  takes texting to a whole new level. This is my first time reviewing an application.  I typically don't spend the time but this one really caught my attention.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I purchased this wee doll for my daughter in 2010 for her second Christmas when she was 17 months old - it is nothing short of absolutely gorgeous and the most perfect size for a little girl to handle.  The facial features very much resemble those of a young baby, and my daughter has enjoyed her immensely.  I have just purchased (and am eagerley awaiting the arrival of) her next Corolle doll - Bebe Charmeur which is 2 inches larger.  Overall I believe you cannot surpass the reality and quality of these wee dolls, and if there was one small criticism it would be the quality of the actual clothing on the Corolle Mon Premier - whilst it looks really good, the fabric rubs and pills and after a few washes it doesn't look quite so nice.    Overall however, I would totally recommend this product.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|As I was very sorry to hear the end coming to 24, now that I have the complete collection I know I can pop it in to the DVD player and revisit the show. I miss it but having the seasons helps soothe the hurt.
0553801473|3.0|I've loved this series for a long time. The first three books are poetic, moving, shocking, and exciting. I must say that AFFC and ADWD were very disappointing compared to the first three book. At first, when I picked up ADWD, I was thrilled to see multiple chapters devoted to my favorite characters: Tyrion, Dany, Jon, and Arya. However, as I started reading, I got more and more frustrated. The pace was sluggish and the narratives lacked the pull that they once had. I actually found myself really disliking Dany and Jon at certain points (which to be honest, made me sad since they were so wonderful in the first three books). The best POVs in this book by far are Victarion and Selmy. Generally, it felt like the entire book was crafted as background to set up the pieces for the next book. As someone who has anxiously awaited for this book for the last half a decade, I was really expecting something more. I wanted to see more character development and more action. Also, another thing I felt particularly frustrating was the lack of resolution for any of the characters. There was no finality for any of the POVs and readers were just left hanging for the most part. Finally, while I understand that cliffhangers are classic GRRM style, it just got to be too much. It's the fifth book for goodness sake. There needs to be something more. While I still agree that this series is one of the best fantasy books out there, I am really hoping the 6th book wows me more (and that it comes out sometime in the near or reasonable future).
B005D9MUWY|3.0|its pretty good i guess but it wont let me finish the<br /> installation. its stuck on choosing typing style. so it keeps popping up a screen while im typing telling me i have to finish the install to have it completely operational.
B000VAPZM2|3.0|i'm sorry but i felt like this movie was all about Ashley Tisdale and Zac Efron. ashley's character was real annoying in this film and her corny songs didn't help the film at all. i was so tempted to turning the channel when i watched it on disney channel. to me, this movie was kinda corny and i really wish they just stopped at the first film.
B001NE80P4|4.0|just like my title says, i really feel like this should've been High School Musical 2. Think about it, High School Musical 2 wasn't even a high school movie. it was a summer movie! duh! at least this one was worth watching more than the second film. this one was actually pretty decent.    High School Musical   = 5 stars  High School Musical 2 = 3 stars  High School Musical 3 = 4 stars    i really hope they're done with this franchise because i keep hearing about a possible 4th film or a TV show based on the films. i think they need to be done with it altogether.
0670022411|5.0|I found this to be a consuming read.  I am hoping that the author can follow it up with a great second installment!  The characters were people (well, sort of people) that I could relate to, lots of fun lot twists, very imaginative rendering of details.  Loved it!
B004A8ZX28|4.0|This film did not do particularly well at the box office, so I was expecting a weak effort intended to cash in on the success Liam Neeson enjoyed in Taken.  I was pleasantly surprised that the film was actually quite good.  I was afraid that the resolution of the basic mystery was going to be far-fetched, as in the Jodie Foster film Flight Plan.  In fact, though, the resolution was quite satisfying.  [SPOILER ALERT]  It is true, though, as other reviewers have noted, that the film bears a strong resemblance to the Bourne Identity.  I have to say that it is not nearly as good as that film, but not bad on its own terms.  There are a few plot holes, however.  How plausible is it that the scientist who invents a new super strain of corn has all the information contained on the hard drive of his laptop, so that by killing him the bad guys keep the strain from being used?  The scientist is shown running a large lab and none of his research assistants have the information?  It's not kept on the labs computers?  Why be so secretive when he intends to give the strain away, rather than patent it?  In addition, the usual Hollywood paranoia about big business is in full play.  Somehow, I doubt any new strain of any crop would sweep the world in a way that would damage \\"agribusiness\\" significantly.  It also seemed a bit implausible that the January Jones character would go back to try to disarm the bomb.  She is apparently afraid of being identified, but wouldn't that also have been a problem if the original plan had come off?  Finally, when the ex-Stasi agent who is helping Liam Neeson, realizes one of the bad guys is coming to kill him, he commits suicide rather than shooting the bad guy.  Seems a bit weak. [End Spoiler Alert]  Although the film has some shortcomings, I think most people who like thrillers will like it.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|A whole DVD of Eddie unplugged. I didn't know what to expect, but I know that what I got exceeded my expectations!  There was beautiful visual footage, but my tendency is to close my eyes and focus solely on the music.  Vedder's voice is sweet but gravelly, powerful yet tender.  This product is a soothing choice.
1451629184|5.0|I am grateful to Jaycee for sharing her story.  What a hard book it must have been to write... but Jaycee did an awesome job! It is a heart-rending story that an innocent, young girl experienced such unimaginable shock, confusion, pain, loneliness, neglect, and fear (and had to deal with it all on her own) while forced to become dependent on her abuser, out of necessity, as he was her only source of social contact, food, etc. for a very long time.  P.G. was a master manipulator. He managed to con parole boards, parole officers, psychiatrists, and the police, so imagine the power he had over a sweet, young girl in his custody whom he could physically overpower, threaten, and subject to all kinds of mental and emotional manipulation. Fear tactics were ever present. In the later years of captivity, she continued to be under strict control: for example, he told her he could find out everything she did on the internet.      I have been cheering for Jaycee and bursting with joy for her ever since the news broke that she was rescued. I really wanted to find out how her new life has been for her and what perspective she gained in hindsight. Her book is very satisfying in that regard. At the end of most chapters in the book is a section called \\"Reflection,\\" which provides comments on her current perspective of what happened. It is also very fascinating to read about her being reunited with her family, the recovery process thus far, and how she is handling her new-found freedom. Perhaps most of all, I was interested in what it was like for her to be reunited with her mother after years of separation and longing to see her again (being that my mother died unexpectedly when I was seven). What a dream come true! It sounds like Jaycee has gained truly brilliant and mature insights. She has come a long way in her recovery thus far.     Definitely, have a box of Kleenex with you when you read this book. I had to keep getting up to go get a tissue to wipe the tears out of my eyes --and then go back again... and again.      Thank you, Jaycee, for sharing your story.  From the depths of my heart, I wish you and your girls every good thing that life has to offer.

B00028HBKM|5.0|It's actually a revolution to have this movie. We know Jesus Christ died on the cross... but did he initially want to? Is that the pass he chose to take from the beginning? How did the people truly treat Jesus, the most unforgettable man in history? Because Mel Gibson was touched by the universe, he was able to depict the true emotion, the true passion that the The Christ carried with him at this time in history-- when everyone denied him.

B004026RBA|5.0|These are a perfect little summer shoe for a little girl.  Great color and look cuter than the traditional croc.  This is great because it doesn't rub against the back of the foot, so I don't have to fight her to wear it! And order here as opposed to directly from the Crocs site because delivery is 95% faster!  Highly recommend this shoe.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|If you're considering buying this book read the free sample chapter first.  Ms. Dugard's story is captivating, her writing skills a bit less so.  Expect to read (or skim) through much related to animals - their companionship was very important to her during her travails.      Despite the less than stellar writing and the volume of words dedicated to pets, Ms. Dugard's story of survival is incredible. The fact that she could put it into words of any sort is commendable, and the result is an interesting, if imperfect, read.
B004LWZW24|1.0|After reading some of the glowing reviews posted here about this movie, I decided to purchase it... What a mistake.. This movie is \\"AWFUL\\".. One of the worst I've seen this year. Besides a total lack of continuity in the story, the screenplay is awful, the acting is awful, the premise is hackneyed, and it is about as scary as a Disney film. There is no sense of the eerie, no creepiness. This whole thing just falls flat. I spent the entire movie going through each scene wondering what I had missed.(Did the DVD just jump ahead or skip?) Unfortunately, it didn't. Pass this one by.
B000305ZS4|1.0|I like a lot of metal, including some Black Metal, but this is by far one of the worst albums I've ever heard.  I'm not talking about the song writing, or the lyrics or vocals or something, I'm talking about the recording itself.  This has by far the worst production of any Black Metal album, and that's saying something for a genre that fans expect, nay, demand have low production value.  It sounds like Emperor recorded this album in a concrete basement, through a PVC pipe, into a broken microphone, with their equipment covered in mud.  Then it sounds like they played the recording back through a blown out speaker at full volume into a telephone and recorded that to the final album.  I would like to criticize the actual music on the album \\"In the Nightside Eclipse\\", but unfortunately it is such a muddled mess all I hear is noise.  If you think ultra-low production quality is neat, then by all means enjoy this mess, but if you like to be able to hear the instruments being played, then pass on this.
0553801473|4.0|I have eagerly awaited this book since I finished the first four Of A Song of Ice and Fire in 2008.  The first three books of the series had superior plot AND characterization.  Each aspect didn't suffer or be neglected for the sake of the other one.  Then came the 4th installment, \\"A Feast for Crows\\".  Compared to other works of the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre, AFFC would rank above most. It falls short compared to GRRM's other works.  It seemed that back story brought everything to a halt in this series.  I hoped that A Dance With Dragons would speed things up a bit.  I will give a qualified yes for plot advancement for this installment.<br /><br />****************************Spoiler Alert!**********************************************************<br /><br />Some of the problems of AFFC and this latest installment can be traced to the ending of [[ASIN:055357342X A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)]].  Two of the main characters Jon Snow and Daenyreus both had spectacular victories.  Jon Snow being named Lord Commander of The Wall and Princess Dany winning Meereen.  The problem being they were both stuck in a literary conundrum.  I was thinking at the end of that book, \\"So how will GRRM get Jon away from the Wall and  get Dany to Westoros?  In AFFC, despite good character back story and attention being given to the Iron Islands, the loose ends were still there.<br /><br />In ADWD some plot was advanced; but there more loose ends were created.

1612130283|5.0|ELJames brings to the world of erotic fiction, great writing, intriguing characters, and a compelling plot. Ana's innocence, Christian's damaged heart, their passion and wit all mix together into a book I could not put down. I've already reread it, whilst waiting for the sequel! And rereading in the light of my ever-increasing to-be-read list is really stating something.
B0034G4P8K|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />The original \\"Transformers\\" film was clearly a fluke.<br /><br />After a lot of initial skepticism, I went to see the original \\"Transformers\\" film and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Funny characters, exciting action scenes, really cool special effects thrown into Michael Bay's blender to produce a very enjoyable summer movie experience. In the inevitable sequel, \\"Revenge of the Fallen\\", Bay heaps on the characters, the special effects, the so-called 'funny moments' and a particularly jarring Jar-Jar Binks-esque pair of characters to create a loud mishmash that completely loses any humanity, any character the first film has. So, when I heard they were doing a third \\"Transformers\\" film, the eternal optimist in me hoped that Bay would learn from the mistakes of the second film and create something closer to the first.<br /><br />But he seems to consider the huge box office of \\"Fallen\\" as license for more of the same.<br /><br />\\"Dark of the Moon\\" begins with an interesting premise. The entire Apollo Space program was a ruse, a cover-up to get to the moon and find and investigate a strange space craft. The space craft crashed many years ago when Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) managed to escape the destruction of the Transformers home planet carrying precious cargo. The United States and Russia begin the Space Race to find out what crash landed on the moon. Flash forward to present day. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his girlfriend Carly (British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whitely) are living in Washington and Sam is trying to get a job. He is more than a little pissed that he helped to save humanity twice, but can't get a job. His parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) pop up for a surprise visit and Sam manages to get a job with an accounting firm run by Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich). At the same time, Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is still running the unit with the Transformers, traveling around the world to put a stop to the various Decepticons. But Optimus Prime is concerned about Mearing's (Frances McDormand) handling of the unit. Then he begins to realize the Decepticons are about to try and retrieve the cargo Sentinel Prime has on his ship. They race to the moon and bring the dormant Transformer back. Eventually, the Opticons and the Decepticons begin to battle in Chicago. And Sam, Carly, Lennox and Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are all back in the center of the action.<br /><br />\\"Dark of the Moon\\" is a little better than the last film. And this can be contributed to the pretty impressive battle in Chicago, which closes the film. It also lasts a long time, making it a little more impressive and also a little excessive. But it is still fun nonetheless.<br /><br />But let's talk more about that in a minute.<br /><br />The best summer films contain the most interesting characters, the most interesting character development. Without believable, or at least interesting, characters, why should we care about all of the special effects, explosions, car chases, etc. In \\"Dark of the Moon\\", the actors seem to be in a contest to see who can out mug each other. Each actor creates a human cartoon character with broad gestures, bugged out eyes, flailing hands, and the like. And the winner of this contest would have to be Shia LaBeouf. He starts screaming at people and yelling and overacting for little or no reason. And he does this throughout the film, basically at the drop of a hat. The whole idea wears thin quickly. Basically, his performance is nothing like what an actual human would do in the same situations. John Malkovich is also so broad, his performance is almost unwatchable. Generally, Malkovich plays strange, unusual people, but Brazos is just a strange, strange creation. Worse it is difficult to figure out why he is acting like this. He doesn't really seem to be a part of the plot. Kevin Dunn and Julie White seem to be comic relief because they appear to be used simply to make Sam cringe and start yelling. Frances McDormand (really?) is also pretty bad, doing very little to create a believable persona. Patrick Dempsey pops up a few times. His performance only prompts me again to wonder why he is working with such a bad agent. After making such an impact in \\"Grey's Anatomy\\", Dempsey has appeared in a number of films and all but one has not provided him with the opportunity to create a memorable character. But the worst is easily Ken Jeong, who made such an impact in \\"The Hangover\\". Because of the success of that role, he seems to be getting additional work in which the filmmakers simply want him to recreate that character, only broader. Yikes. Broader than \\"The Hangover\\"? In \\"Dark of the Moon\\", he never utters a word in anything that could be considered a normal voice. He is always yelling, whispering in a loud voice, flailing his arms, the like. Basically, it is a repeat of his performance in \\"The Hangover 2\\".<br /><br />On the opposite side of the coin, Josh Duhamel seems to be in a different film altogether. If the other characters are broad and over-the-top, Lennox is downright sedate. He is always serious, always has an eye on the situation at hand. In other words, he is in an action film and tries to figure out how to get out of the situations created by the Transformers.<br /><br />When the action shifts to Chicago and the Decepticons begin to put their plan into motion, the film picks up a bit. Maybe this is because everyone is running around and fighting and there simply isn't any time to try and act.<br /><br />Why this battle takes place in Chicago is still lost on me. For some reason, the Decepticons have chosen to use Chicago as Ground Zero for their plan. Their plan is to use these machines to... Well, if that is really that important to you, you should find out what their plan is by watching the film. But why they choose Chicago is vague.<br /><br />The climatic battle is long, a little excessive and fun to watch. It's even a little corny because the Decepticons raise the bridges completely hampers the progress of the humans and this becomes the main thrust of their efforts for a while. \\"We have to get the bridges lowered\\". People are trying to hack into computers, soldiers are trying to get close to auxiliary switches, everyone wants to get close to the bridges because \\"We have to get the bridges lowered.\\" I guess they can't use boats, swim, use the El tunnels, get close enough to use missile launchers, etc.<br /><br />Once the fighting gets under way, everyone gets together to come up with a plan. They have to take out a certain tower, because the Decepticons have set up this machine that will... Again, see the movie. But to take out this tower, they have to get close to the tower. How do you do that when all of the bridges are up? Well, they decide to do a dangerous sky dive. This is really the centerpiece of the entire sequence and it is pretty impressive. A large group of soldiers drops into the sky and flies towards their target, small wings attached between their arms and bodies. It is a visually stunning stunt and pretty exciting to watch. Bay seems to realize this because he includes the stunt twice. Normally, doing something twice in a row would point out the lack of original ideas, but I didn't care because it was fun to watch.<br /><br />At one point, all of the humans are trying to get to a floor in the building directly across from the Decepticons machine. Apparently, they can only disable the machine by shooting at it in a straight line, directly across from it. The Decepticons learn they are in the building and send Shock Wave to take them out. Shock Wave is a large Transformer with large extensions, tentacles, that appear to extend from the main body and can wind and tunnel into anything, in a more fluid manner. Shock Wave is introduced early in the film, but the true terror of the Decepticon doesn't come into play until this sequence.<br /><br />And it also provides an opportunity for Sam and Carlyto get in the way of danger. Repeatedly. And it provides an opportunity for Sam to save his pouty lipped girlfriend more than once.<br /><br />The most impressive thing about the \\"Transformers\\" films is the special effects. Sure, CGI can let most filmmakers accomplish some pretty impressive stuff, but when your special effects move as fast as the Transformers do, that adds another degree of difficulty, another degree of interest and it really holds your attention.<br /><br />The least impressive thing about the \\"Transformers\\" films (and any Michael Bay film for that matter) is the acting. But in the first film, the acting seemed to be sweet, somewhat genuine and even a little plausible. Sure, there was a lot of shouting and John Turturro was pretty over-the-top, but these moments seemed justified by the unique nature of the threat. In \\"Fallen\\", the balance shifted and the acting grew exponentially cartoonish. In \\"Dark of the Moon\\", I can't say the acting has improved, in fact, I think Shia LaBeouf is even worse in this film, but the balance has shifted again, just slightly. The unique and interesting nature of the special effects and some of the action scenes outweighs the arm flailing and histrionics from Sam.<br /><br />Based on the enormous success of this film, there will be a sequel. Yawn. I want to say I won't be in the theater, waiting to get my money's worth.

1451629184|5.0|What an amazing story. Read this book in a day, because I couldn't put it down. Jaycee has a true testimony that hope can save your life. What strength this girl has, and what a blessing to the world that she chose to share her story.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|The problem with \\"Bad Teacher is that she simply isn't bad enough.<br /><br />Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) puts in her time as a teacher at a junior high school, all to prove to her sugar daddy fianc&eacute;e that she is the marrying type and not really a gold digging viper. But her future step-mother puts a stop to the wedding and Elizabeth returns to the school unready and bitter about having to teach her classes. The job is now necessary to provide a living, a very modest living. The first day back, she runs into the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake) and quickly learns he comes from a rich family and recently broke up with his buxom girlfriend. Elizabeth becomes convinced the way to Scott's heart is by getting a new, expensive boob job. Elizabeth desperately comes up with an assortment of ways to earn, scam and steal the money for the operation. Russell (Jason Segel), the gym teacher, shows some interest in her, but because he is a gym teacher, making a gym teacher's salary, she couldn't be less interested. But he continues to make overtures. Amy (Lucy Punch, the stalker in \\"Dinner With Schmucks\\") is a good teacher, who takes great pride in her job, so naturally she and Elizabeth develop an ongoing rivalry. Then, Elizabeth's friend, Lynn (Phyllis Smith, TV's \\"The Office\\") tells her about a teaching prize, a prize Amy has won every year. Elizabeth has a new goal.<br /><br />\\"Bad Teacher\\", directed by Jake Kasdan (\\"Zero Effect\\", \\"Orange County\\") has a handful of laughs, but just as it seems to be fulfilling the promise of the concept, it starts to pull back, as though the filmmakers are afraid to push the envelope too far.<br /><br />Diaz's portrayal of Elizabeth is basically a one-joke pony. The teacher is foul mouthed and doesn't seem to care who hears it. That's pretty much it. Occasionally, she does something that could be considered 'bad', but these moments simply don't go far enough. The problem is everything is too easy for her. Once she gets an idea, it goes according to her plan. The complications arise from the other people around her. But because these complications don't really present much of a roadblock, everything seems too easy for her. Imagine if Lucy Ricardo had found a job she was good at, a job to earn the money for her new hat, if Ricky had let her into the show, countless episodes of \\"I Love Lucy\\" wouldn't exist. \\"I Love Lucy\\" is such a timeless classic because Lucy has to work very hard to get to her goals and they are extremely funny because she almost always gets in her own way. \\"Bad Teacher\\" misses a lot of opportunities to be funny because she doesn't have to work hard enough, there aren't enough complications.<br /><br />In fact, the funniest moments come from Amy Squirrel, the character played by Lucy Punch, because she can't convince anyone that Elizabeth is a terrible educator. And, because she is complaining so much, the focus begins to shift to her and we start to learn things about her.<br /><br />Lucy Punch played easily the most unfunny and annoying character in \\"Dinner With Shmucks\\", her previous film. Which is saying a lot. Everyone in that film was annoying and unfunny. In \\"\\"Teacher\\", Amy has some vague similarities, but because her efforts are consistently thwarted by Elizabeth, she becomes desperate and a little funny. This goes on so long that everyone else starts to turn their attention towards Amy, dredging up her unwelcome history and turning a spotlight on her actions. And because of this, Amy becomes the funniest character in the film.<br /><br />As Diaz is the star of the film, we want and need her to be the center of the story. She is the 'Bad Teacher'. She needs to be bad, to shock us. She sure has a foul mouth, but that is pretty much the extent of it. Maybe some people find this to be enough, but I don't. We need to see and hear more examples of how bad she is. If you are going to make an 'R' rated comedy called \\"Bad Teacher\\", really push the boundaries. Diaz andKasdan don't do this.<br /><br />The set-up for \\"Teacher\\" is funny. We quickly get why Elizabeth is a teacher, what she is trying to do and how she plans to accomplish it. But then everything in her life comes crashing down and we begin to learn a little bit more about Elizabeth. She is a truly desperate person and begins to come up with some ideas about how to get herself back on track.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake plays Scott, the too-sweet, too-naïve substitute teacher who captures Elizabeth's eye. She corners him and learns more about him. He could be the ticket to the Sweet Life. Initially, his \\"aw-shucks\\" naïvet&eacute; is fun and so different from Elizabeth that we can't help but chuckle. And then he seems oblivious to the ongoing battle between Elizabeth and Amy, which is also amusing. But these ongoing situations only carry the humor so far. When nothing else is developed, the film dies quickly and resorts to the Timberlake staple; he starts singing an older song in a weird way. He has done this repeatedly, on \\"Saturday Night Live\\", in films, it even seems to be a part of his new film \\"Friends with Benefits\\". It was a funny idea the first few times. But it has now played out.<br /><br />Jason Segel plays Russell, the gym teacher, and he also has a few good moments. When he initially makes a play for the bad teacher, he is quickly rebuffed. But this doesn't seem to faze him. Later, he does become miffed and decides to retaliate. Again, good for a few moments and then nothing happens.<br /><br />This is the main problem for the entire film. All of the set-ups are good. For a few moments. But they don't evolve and take on new dimensions to continue to surprise us and entertain us.<br /><br />\\"Horrible Bosses\\", released two weeks after \\"Teacher\\", would seem to be ripe for the same problems and criticisms. But \\"Bosses\\" delivers on the \\"Horrible\\" promise. Each of the three bosses is very bad, for very different reasons. And each of the three actors seems to relish and enjoy the chance to push the boundaries.<br /><br />In \\"Teacher\\", Kasdan and Diaz seem to pull back, afraid of going to that darker place. And because of that, \\"Bad Teacher\\" doesn't just give an 'F', it gets a D.funny. We quickly get why Elizabeth is a teacher, what she is trying to do and how she plans to accomplish it. But then everything in her life comes crashing down and we begin to learn a little bit more about Elizabeth.

B001QWBM62|5.0|Love this recorder...it is extremely versatile in terms of what it can do for and with sound...The zoom h4n is a must have especially if you are an indie filmmaker like myself... I paired it with the azden sgm 1x and I'm satisfied with the results...This is the best option (trust me Ive done about a months worth of searching for cheaper solutions)... Purchase with confidence
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love this movie!  It is one of my most favorite animated movies, perhaps top of the list.  The story telling is so charming!  Makes me happy every time I see it!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had no complaints with the regular stock Android keyboard.  Then I got this today as it was free.  It has its kinks and I have to change a few of my \\"habits\\" but all in all - WOW.  I have never seen prediction done so nicely. It learns from your texting history to make predictions customized to YOU.  I will never go back.  I would pay $4 for this without a thought and I have never paid for an app in my life.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I have had the previous version of this app, and kept returning to swype because I don't always say the same thing.  Yes, this keyboard is incredible, and it has helped in text messages, but my swyping ways just keep me from completely switching to SwiftKey.  Should they ever combine swype like interface with SwiftKey, I would be happy to pay for it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This quickly became my keyboard of choice. It has a multitude of configuration options and typing is very precise. The I highly recommended it
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was contemplating buying this app after seeing my buddy use it the other say i cant beleive its the app of the day today,  its by far the best keyboard app you can get for android.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Auto space is always on.  Wtf gives.  I guess i just need to adjust to the keyboard. New neon skin is cool, left out in the beta.
B0026S1XD2|5.0|A really good instrumental lp from 1974. It's been over 37 years since I last heard this entire lp on 8 track. A geat one to rediscover again if you haven't heard it in years. Put the headphones on and enjoy like I did on 8 track.
B004E0Z4XK|1.0|Unless you're a big fan of spaghetti westerns, this is probably not the CD for you.  Soundtrack theme music like this is tedious after a few measures.  Okay to set a background and mood, but not listened to outright.  The producers made a valiant effort to breath new life into these songs but they are a high plains dust bowl.  Disappointing compared to Broken Bells.
B002WDL534|5.0|Fantastic!  Lady Gaga is a wonderful talent.  I teach high school, and I ordered one of these for a colleague, using my account.  I was lamenting the fact, once it came in, that it was not for me.  So my students surprised me with an identical copy of it.  My seniors just graduated, and it was their present to me upon their graduation--a thank you of sorts.  I always use Lady Gaga as an example in my classroom of focus and goal realization.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|why would they have this here? i am very offended by the fact. i pity those that use this so much.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this all is downright spooky! it predicts my words sometimes before I even type the first letter! I guess it goes by the context of the sentence. This saves me so much time as I'm not the best texter. The only thing I don't like is that the keys are a bit small but I still give it five stars. And I got it free!
0765365278|5.0|To begin this critique on the proper proverbial page (no pun intended), I feel the need to disclose the fact that I have been only mildly enthused with Brandon Sanderson's fantasy works prior to having read this one.  Having read the Mistborn trilogy after much acclaim, I was left feeling that Sanderson's intentions and ability to tell a decently woven tale outshone the actual writing itself.  Lumping him in with Patrick Rothfus, Scott Lynch, Joe Abercrombie and such, it was fairly easy to dismiss Sanderson as simply the upper echelon of the \\"new breed\\" of fantasy authors: Ambitious, a bit too modernized, and sorely lacking the near poetic voice that made JRR Tolkien, Robert Jordan and George RR Martin so enduring.<br /><br />That said I had been undeniably curious about The Way of Kings since its initial release in hardcover if, for nothing else, the fact that it was incomparably ambitious, even for epic fantasy.  Over 400,000 words for a debut piece slated to be the start of a 10-book series... The sheer immensity of the series had my curiosity, abundant glowing reviews notwithstanding.  I waited for the paperback and just now completed the massive tome.  My only regret is not having immersing myself in this masterwork sooner.<br /><br />The story itself is a fairly complex character driven piece that really defies accurate comparison save only perhaps to some of Sanderson's own past works.  The reader basically follows the exploits of war torn land through the perspective of a surgeon-turned slave, a thieving young woman, a guilt-laden assassin, and the honorable uncle of a young king.<br /><br />As has been witnessed in other Sanderson works, perhaps the author's greatest strength above all others is to tie together the threads of a seemingly disconnected cast with alarming grace and precision.  Somehow Sanderson manages the arduous task of telling his story, a story certainly worth the effort by the way, across multiple perspectives without troubling the reader by means of repeating or contradicting himself.  Truly this fact alone almost makes the novel worth reading but alas the prose itself has proven worthy to even this hardened skeptic.<br /><br />For starters Sanderson should be credited for approaching an industry as clich&eacute; and overdone as epic fantasy with what I can only describe as \\"fan-boy\\" ambition.  Just like with Mistborn, one really gets the feeling he doesn't limit himself based on what \\"should be done\\" or more importantly what has been done before.  Instead he integrates terminology and science from a wide variety of human history.  His magic systems and weaponry often seem to have more in common with science fiction than they do high fantasy.  Blades that appear from hilts like lightsabers, magic wielders able to manipulate their mass and surrounding gravity, charms capable of altering the properties of physical elements, these are just a few of the many concepts Sanderson introduces here.<br /><br />Then there is the world itself:  If the technology within hints of science fiction, then very planet serving as the setting of the piece comes straight from the hallowed halls of scifi geekdom.  Here we are given a world consisting largely of cracked and splintered rock where violent storms frequently wreak unimaginable havoc.  We are told of multiple moons in orbit, each casting a various hue of light on the land.  We are given a whole host of crustacean-like inhabitants, sentient cultures, and political backbones from which to draw.<br /><br />To some purists, this tinkering with the fantasy formula will be off-putting.  I recall an interview with Tolkien some time ago whereby the author said that his integration of men, horses, and the like to Middle Earth was the anchor on which to retain relatability; that without fellow humans of our own historical understanding, the whole tale was simply too fantastical.  In a way Sanderson does tread some dangerous territory in The Way of Kings.  Granted he integrates such staples as a bit of medieval political institutions, concepts of slavery, brutality, superstition in a largely technologically undeveloped civilization; the otherworldliness he incorporates sometimes works against him.<br /><br />As grand as my opinion of this work has proven, there are a few caveats worth mentioning.  The first of which is that Sanderson's style, for better or worse, is very present here from beginning to end.  For those unaware of what this means, I have come to conclude that he writes in a very lackluster style largely absent from the fantasy genre.  Wordy descriptions, obsession with minor details such as geographic positioning or the fabric of the wears of each and every character will not be found here.  Additionally abundant secondary characters, bouncing story threads, and made-up languages are also shelved.  Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing!  The downside is that occasionally Sanderson's presentation can come off as almost too lax; too straightforward.  Again returning to my comparison of a writing style almost reminiscent of fan fiction, Sanderson's wording and grammatical structure seem to sacrifice beauty or rhythm in favor of getting a point across.<br /><br />Finally, and in keeping with the Sanderson brand of fantasy, expect a large number of classifications that can only be described as Sandersonisms: \\"Shardbearers, Voidbringers, Surgebinders, Stormblessed\\" and so on.  Readers familiar with his works will know exactly what I mean but make no mistake, no prior knowledge of anything Sanderson has written prior is required for this one.<br /><br />In all, The Way of Kings is truly a very unique piece of literature in a genre absolutely rife with recycled trite.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it's for everyone, but most fans of epic fantasy will find something quite spectacular within its pages.  At the very least, Sanderson's ability to pull together a bunch of wide-sweeping plot threads, complete with jumps around a timeline within, so brilliantly and seemingly effortless makes considering giving this book a go by itself.  I'm certainly glad to have been premature in my having lumped him in with the latest batch of fantasy hype.stitutions, concepts of slavery, brutality, superstition in a largely technologically undeveloped civilization; the otherworldliness he incorporates sometimes works against him.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|I think I am going to like this keyboard. It helps with all my type errors? Just started using it about 10 minutes ago.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|simply put this is the best keyboard application ever.  I have used all others and this blows them out of the water.
B0046ZG2VG|2.0|Very low saturation and therefore soft, but for the price (as compared to color 600) I can't complain too much.
1452101248|5.0|I love delicious food. I love simple ingredients that create an exceptional meal. I don't have tons of time for overly complex cooking methods, but I cherish a good meal, particularly ones spent with friends. Plenty is a cookbook you can use to make incredible meals that work for a quiet night at home or to something more festive, such as a dinner party, just as easily. The flavor combinations truly do bring out the flavors of the featured vegetables. I made the green bean salad (after I made the burnt eggplant and pomegranate molasses babaganouj) and it was extraordinary. It was so simple and not something I would normally think would be so incredible, but after hearing the interview with Yottam on NPR (link is here [...]) and testing the eggplant, I decided to test the green bean salad. It was one of the best things I have ever cooked. I immediately ordered the cookbook after making this and have already given as a gift to two people (I've only owned it for a couple of weeks!). Normally this salad is not something that would necessarily catch my eye, but I've made it twice in 2 weeks(I substitute snow peas for sugar snap peas!).
B0050KEVO6|1.0|Ads are fine. Constantly nagging to upgrade not so fine. Downloaded yesterday, tried it today and deleted.  Play was interrupted at least once a minute to sell upgrades like an undo button.  Glad it was Amazon free application.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|We usually try to ease into new cd's when we purchase them to avoid burnout, but with \\"19\\" that simply was not an option.  We've been playing it almost daily.  It has a variety of sounds and Adele's voice is enchanting.  Full of meaning and heart, the album plays well from start to finish and is a good album for pop lovers and pop haters - it's just good music.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Just like their previous keyboard, it's great. It does a great job predicting words and correcting misspellings for us fast typers. Of course I wish there were more themes but the ones that are on it now are awesome. Button layout is prettay prettay prettay pretty good. Would like to see a little more at the $4 price but you won't be disappointed with this keyboard.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|Dario Marianelli's rapturous score -the best of 2011 in fact- serves as a ravishing underpinning to this most gorgeous and visually enthralling of all Jane Eyre adaptations.  For me, even with THE TREE OF LIFE, OF GODS AND MEN and INCENDIES in the mix, this is the best film of 2011.    Can't wait for this blu-ray release!
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|It's been a few years since Lightning McQueen learned to take it slow. Now he's been racing, and has won 4 piston cups. After all that, he want to slow done once again. However, when he sees that the world grand pri is coming round, and one of it's racers, is mocking him, Mater (Larry the cable guy) convices him to enter the grand pri.  They head to japan, where Mater runs into super spy, Finn McMissile, who thinks Mater is an American spy he wishes to meet with. Him and his partner, Holly shiftwell, take mater on to help them stop the evil Professer Zundapp from using a new alternative fuel to..well you know.    The first question you might want answer is \\"Is it as bad as critics say?\\". Well, my answer is...No. Not at all! Infact... i loved it!    Let me first say the one problem i had, which didn't really bug me that much, but it's still enough to take some points off    Like some people have said, it doesn't have the heart all the pixar movies have. There's only one scene of real emotion, and it feels slapped on. But it doesn't really take away from how fun it is.    I think what really makes it good, is the spy element. Some people say it's out of place, but i didn't care, it was still pretty cool. Finn is a great character, while not too complex, he is just awesome. This is due to a great performance by Micheal Caine. He just sounds great, and it seems like he had fun with this movie. Everyone does in fact    Now for the other common complaint: Mater. He's the main character this time around, which bugs people. Personally, i didn't mind it. I love mater, and he's big role in it is fine for me. He plays off well against Finn and Holly,. Mater is also just plain awesome. He ends up figuring out the bad guys plan in a very cool way, and he is bad ass with his new spy status    Yes, McQueen isn't in it much, but he is in it. I would of like to see more of him, and as a spy, but it's ok he's not in it much. For those wondering, A113 is on Mater's license plate. Alsoon the tail of the spy plane Siddeley. Additionally, the number appears beneath the photo of Axlerod's engine when Finn, Holley, and Mater are examining it for the first time.    Infact, this has the most A113's in a pixar movie. Pretty cool, eh?      The score is pretty cool too. Though it's not the best. The main theme is really good i must say. This is done by the same cuy who composed The Incredibles and Up, just so you know.    As for what i think of the negative reviews..eh i don't care anymore. So pixar made a negatively reviewed movie. So what? Everyone makes mistakes once in awhile. Though i do think some of the reviewers are asking too much from this movie.    To sum it up, Cars 2 is not the smartest pixar movie, but it's still an incredibly fun ride and i will be watching it for years to come.    Score: 8.9/10    Oh, and if you wanna know my thoughts on The Toy Story Short, that came with Cars 2, I loved it. It was funny.

Where will my dinner come from?  We can't decide to go vegetarian, because if American Livestock Agriculture is destroyed, vegetable farming will be destroyed with it.  Enough said.

B003Y5H5A6|5.0|This review is based on seeing the movie Theatrically, not from seeing it on DVD or Blu-Ray    So Captain America: The First Avenger is the last major comic book movie to come out this summer, and the studio system has certainly saved the best for last. Captain America: The First Avenger is filled with action and adventure, subtle romance, a villain that seems to be just pure evil, and one of the finer hero's journey stories. I saw the movie in 2D, because I read it wasn't worth seeing in 3D, and after seeing the film I didn't see anything where 3D would have added much to the experience of watching the film.    The cast was absolutely amazing, everyone played their part and didn't out shine anyone in terms of performance. Chris Evan signed on for nine films when he was cast Captain America. That was a great decision on the studio's part because he was spectacular in the role, a huge departure from his other Marvel based role of The Human Torch in the Fantastic Four films. He is able to capture pure good essence of the Captain America character without a factor of unbelievability that he is too good, and he comes off as relatable throughout the film.    Hayley Atwell plays the Captain's love interest, Peggy Carter, she plays a strong willed but still slightly vulnerable female lead. She's assertive and certainly has some attitude to her. It was great to see that they did not dumb down her character in the transition from comic book to film, because it is very easy to do that when making a movie set in the 1940s but the writers and director didn't do that at all.    My personal favorite performance of the film is Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull. When this casting was originally announced, I got excited because Weaving is great in every geek property he has a part in, whether it is The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, or V For Vendetta and now Captain America, he always turns in a stellar performance. The Red Skull for those who aren't familiar with the character is one of the more major villains in the Marvel universe, and one that doesn't compromise his agenda for anything, he is just pure evil and nothing less than that, and Hugo Weaving conveys just that as The Red Skull.    The one detail that I was a bit weary about going into this film was the director, Joe Johnston. For those who don't know, Joe Johnston early in his career. directred some awesome films such as The Rocketeer and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, while lately directing some films that were just terrible, The Wolfman (2010) and Jurassic Park III. But upon seeing Captain America: The First Avenger, Joe Johnston has regained his directorial touch he had while directing The Rocketeer, which makes me think he should just stick with directing movies that take place in the 1940s. The performances he was able to get out of the actors and choices in how to shoot scenes comes across as positive on screen. He deserves a good amount for the overall package of a movie he was able to put together.    In terms of the actual story and plot, without going into spoilers too much, the story of Steve Rogers becoming Captain America and going after the bad guys, was just really enjoyable, well paced, and just fun to watch. The love story between Peggy Carter and Captain America was subtle, didn't seem forced, and flowed really well into the overall plot of the film. The fight scenes were well shot. Never was the camera too tight on the action, which was a problem in the other Avengers movie this summer, Thor. And the final fight of the movie, was great to sit through and see it develop, awesome build up and great payoff, including some possible foreshadowing for The Avengers, maybe???    Sure there are a few issues with the film but I'd have to go into spoilers to explain them and I don't feel like ruining the movie for others who maybe reading this who haven't seen it yet. So go see Captain America: The First Avenger and then start the countdown to May 4, 2012 when this series of Marvel films finally will payoff and The Avengers will kick off what will hopefully the best movie summer in a long time.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Every time I look at the latest carving up of the original Star Wars trilogy I think more and more that Star Wars is the Michael Jackson of the film industry;  Every time you see them they are all redone and it always makes things worse.
B004GHYCKW|4.0|PJ Harvey once again changes her musical style, this time more towards a quieter folk rock sound. This may alienate some of her long term fans who preferred her harder edged punk/blues sound of albums from the 90s. But Let England Shake provides another dimension to PJ's musical catalogue. Out of the 12 tracks, the songs apart from 2 of them tend to be short (under 4 minutes long).<br /><br />Like with all her past work you really need to listen to her songs a few times before deciding whether they are going to grab you or otherwise. When I first heard this album I didn't take to it at all. Having persevered I can say that LES has grown on me a lot since although there are still 2 songs which I can't get my head around. Despite that, it's overall a pleasant, if challenging listen to begin with, whose theme questions the purpose of war, particularly emphasizng its aftermath. PJ's lyrics to the songs are more poetic than with those on her previous albums. Favorite tracks include The Last Living Rose, The Glorious Land and Written On The Forehead with its strange reggae beat.<br /><br />PJ Harvey has taken a big risk with this album as she did with its predecessor, White Chalk. She no longer evokes the image of a 'rock goddess' as many of her hardcore fans took for granted. But she is now in her early 40s and  has moved on from those musically raw blusesy days. But I must admit that LES is not my personal favorite album by PJ. But the most important thing about PJ has been her live performances which is where she always shines.<br /><br />* LES won the Mercury Music Prize 2011 PJ Harvey is the first person to win this prize twice. It also won Best Album category in the 2012 Ivor Novello Awards

0316098329|1.0|I am really amazed at how many people gave these book 4 and 5 stars, I didn't find many redeeming qualities in this book. The book is written in baby talk but the 5 year old has an IQ of a genius, and then some. Terrible ending, so much could have been done with this ending to make it better.  Don't waste your money on this dud.
0061726826|4.0|Wow. I just finished Delirium and I thought I'd give you my initial reaction. Well, when I finished my first reaction was Noooo! Damn you Lauren Oliver. Not because the book was bad but because it ended on a cliffhanger.   The premise of this book, a world where love is forbidden and a procedure has to be done to remove the love part of the brain, intrigued me. A world without love? Scandalous! That being said I was prepared to not like the book because I thought it would be to much of a romance, and at times it is. The middle of the book is a little lovey dovey for my taste but the ever present threat of Lena's operation made it exciting. The end of the novel is super fast paced and thrilling. I can't wait for more
B004XJHBCE|5.0|In short, this app just works.  Highly customizable and really smooth.  At this point, I'd give more than 5 stars if I could.  Well done!
B004LUS390|5.0|I have been using this on my Toshiba Thrive. I love all the brush options and that you can create layers. This app is very user friendly and I never accidentally closed the app or deleted my picture while drawing all over the tablet (like I did in another drawing app). I also love that when I hit the back button that would have closed my app, it asked me it I wanted to save my picture. I haven't experienced any lag while drawing. I love this app and would give it ten stars if I could! :-)

B005DC68NI|5.0|Written with the trademark wit and intelligence his blog readers have come to expect, David Gaughran has crafted a winner with \\"Let's Get Digital\\".  It is a one-stop shop for everything a writer reads to know before pursuing the self-publishing path, from how to format, promote, and better one's work.  I particularly enjoyed the 33 testimonials in part 3, showing it IS possible to make it as an indie.  Gaughran is an eloquent writer who obviously put a lot of time and effort into making this book perfect.  Any writer needs to pick it up--it will convince you to put yourself out there and quit letting that manuscript collect dust under your desk.
1569242739|5.0|I am not a vegan, nor do I have any plans to be one.      That being said, this book has some of the most amazing cupcake recipes I've ever encountered.  I gave it a shot because of the outstanding reviews, and because I am interested in other \\"food lifestyles\\".  Every recipe I've made has been moist, beautiful, and - most importantly - delicious.  Everyone is usually happy with cupcakes anyway, but I always get rave reviews when I make these vegan ones (rum raisin, in particular).  More often than not, people are shocked to find out that they are eating vegan (I live in the south, cut them some slack).  So the authors definitely deliver on the recipe front.  They even throw in a few gluten-free recipes, which is fantastic given that my family is transitioning to the paleo diet.    However, what I most appreciate about this book (besides for awesome, easy to follow recipes and their quirky sense of humor) is that the authors (cupcakestresses?)are not \\"annoying\\" vegans.  You know the ones I'm talking about.  They aren't preachy, they don't try to make you feel guilty nor do they act as if their lifestyle is somehow superior to your lowly egg/dairy consuming ways, and they don't try to \\"convert\\" anyone into being vegan.  In fact, they pretty much assume you're on board, because you bought the book in the first place - so they don't even bother instructing or explaining the finer points of being vegan - which is great for me, and a huge plus in their favor.  This cookbook could easily fit onto any meat-loving, egg-chomping, milk drinker's bookshelf.     So if you aren't vegan - or are turned off by the idea of having to wade through essays on why vegans are better people before getting to the good stuff - do not be afraid to try this book out!! They do not disappoint!
B003Y5H51K|3.0|Sanctum is about extreme adventure gone all wrong. This extreme adventure team is led by Frank Mcguire ( Richard Roxburgh) a pioneer explorer and joined by his son Josh ( Rhys Wakefiled) As with all parent son relationship this one is downright uneasy, however the movie gives them a chance to settle their differences. The rest of the team also has issues with friction and the caves give them a lot of opportunity to settle their scores and air their differences.<br />The film has been beautifully photographed but the script has been poorly written and thus did not hold my attention. I was primarily drawn to this movie because of production duties helmed by a certain James Cameroon but needless to say.... a pretty boring and average film. 2 stars 7/16/2011
0553801473|5.0|When I sat down to read this book I did so with six years worth of expectations and speculations sitting next to me, and I'm sure many others can relate. But do yourself a favor - throw them to the wind before you start reading. For the first one hundred pages or so I found myself disappointed. This wasn't how I had imagined the story would be! That's the pitfall of taking so long to write a book - the reader is going to unintentionally fill in some gaps during the wait. As soon as I learned to let go of that speculative version of the story in my head, the book was much more enjoyable. In fact it's downright beautiful!<br /><br />George R.R. Martin has a habit of killing off characters on a whim - we all know this, and it's one of the things that makes these books so human and seemingly unscripted. But in this book he does the exact opposite, and we are reunited with characters thought to be long dead. Just as I would feel intense sadness at the loss of a character, there was an equal feeling of surprise to see an old face reappear. Yes, there are long sections of the story where people are traveling to and fro, but if you can't appreciate the descriptions of the exotic places, can't taste those delicacies as Tyrion experiences them, can't feel the heat of the eastern lands, then you need to stop fretting about the end of the journey and just sit back and enjoy the ride!

0553801473|1.0|Nearly 1,100 pages and that is all he can progress the plot line?  Do we really need to hear over and over about what people are wearing?  All the wasted pages on food and clothing descriptions should have been used to end the book on something besides multiple cliff hangers.  I gave Martin the benefit of the doubt after the last book but I will not recommend that anyone read this until the series is complete.  Five plus years is just too long to wait for this kind of junk.
1592536913|5.0|This is the book that Monsieur Vernes referenced for inspiration.  1000 full color photographs of arguably the best Steampunk inventions, mods, art, clothing, and stage productions currently available.  I am amazed and inspired with each submersion into this Victorian Sci-Fi documentary; it depths continually revealing new treasures.    The title is a little misleading in that there are 1000 photographs, but several items are featured in two or three of these 1000 as detail views. There is an image directory in the back that gives brief explanations of each photo.     A must have for the collector, inventor, and writer and well worth the price.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|If you like time warp-themed movies like \\"Memento\\" and \\"The Prestige\\", enjoy non linear story-telling like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" and enjoy horror/thriller genres, then \\"Triangle\\" is a movie you will likely enjoy.    Please note that this is a horror/thriller that will require you to solve the puzzle of why the main character is in the situation that she's in. If you want to sit back, and enjoy getting freaked out, then you'll get irritated. It's like \\"The Game\\" with Michael Douglas.     After the movie, I recommend reading the responses that \\"Wayne Klein\\" wrote to the one-star reviews. His insight to the ending of the movie made me appreciate the subtlety of the story telling even more.

B001TW68P4|4.0|This latest Turtles collection is now the only one in print. There were at least three prior Rhino Turtles collections, and a few budget collections on various labels. This one on Flo and Eddie Records, sounds very good. I'm always hesitant about buying \\"new\\" and \\"newly remastered\\" CD collections these days, since \\"iPod mastering\\" came about in the last 10 years or so. Things are compressed and mastered very loudly, or brick walled, so they might sound better over some cheap earbuds, but it squeezes the life and dynamic range out of the music, effectively making it sound like FM radio...no wonder vinyl is making a comeback! It's ironic that the record companies have now made the superior format inferior. The very reasons we bought CDs in the first place (signal to noise ratio, dynamic range, etc.) are out the window. People don't care about quality any more, they just wanna hit the \\"gimmie it now\\" button and have it now. MP3s are \\"good enough\\" for most people. And let's face it, the record companies are making ONE master to use for both the new CD release and MP3 downloads. (heavy sigh) Ok rant over.    I do have to say that this CD is mastered very well. They didn't compress the daylights out of it, and it's not overly loud and fatiguing to listen to. A peek at the wav forms bears this out. This is mastered like any CD from the late 90's was, or at the same levels anyway. (Before we entered the loudness wars)    The thing that keeps me from giving this collection 5 stars is the fact that five of the songs, \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\" \\"You Baby\\" \\"Let Me Be\\" \\"The Story of Rock & Roll\\" and \\"Grim Reaper of Love\\" are in MONO. Talk about sounding so 1950's and very early 60's! Mono sounds old and dated, sorry. Even the Rhino CD from 1984 has all the songs in true stereo. I'm not sure why this is, and I don't know about the two other Rhino collections because I don't own them. I think on the song \\"You Baby\\" I can see what Flo and Eddie did. The main guitar on that (stereo) versionwas recorded really distorted, probably recorded directly on the multi-track studio master tape that way. On the mono remaster, that guitar is muddied up and buried deeper in the background. Comparing them side by side, the mono version might sound smoother, but it doesn't have the high end that the stereo version has. I'll take clean with a little bit of (originally recorded) distortion over smooth and muddy any day.    Lots of people complain about the volume on the first Rhino CD, \\"The Turtles 20 Greatest Hits\\" from 1984 and re-issued in 1990, but that was mastered before CD mastering went loud and mental. It's actually cleaner with more dynamic range. All you have to do is use your bloody volume knob! Failing that, rip them to wav files on your hard drive and boost the volume up 3db and it will be at about the same level as the newer CD, then you can do a really fair comparison. BTW people, louder doesn't mean better.    If you can't get your hands on any of the Rhino Turtles \\"best of\\" CDs, and you don't want to go for all of their individual album CD reissues, you can't go too far wrong with this one.

0345529057|5.0|Even if your not into fantasy these books are a great read. Meaty with great charecter stories that made me want to simply read and read more. The story line itself is set in a fantasy land of north and south regions with several ruling houses or great Families. Its like medieval meets fantasy meets ancient greek or viking times. Its a love story interwoven with power, corruption, cruelty and blazing wonder.    I really don't know how the author keeps track of his charecters story lines as I even now having demolished these books and moving onto book 5, am already planning on re reading the stories.     Do yourself a favour and get these books, immerse in the Game yourself, the game of Thrones. You will find you have favourite charecters and those you like less so but all will move you. Enjoy!
0061906220|5.0|My family ADORES this book. The six-year-old reads it, the four-year-old joins in on the repetitious parts, and one-year-old has even started chiming in. It is so much fun to read together because of the rhythm, colors, and shoutable refrain, \\"Goodness no!\\" I have even found the moral to be a source of personal encouragement and a reminder to stay positive in tough times: \\"No matter what you step in, just keep walking along, singing your song, because it's all good.\\" I have literally shared it in a support group I attend. Even adults need a chance to smile and remember to be grateful no matter what we step in. :)

0307887960|3.0|This is not too dissimilar to the South Beach Diet. And like its first cousin the Adkins diet it will work. But as I have come to learn the real bottom line to all of these diets is that it really boils down to calories consumed at the end of the day. We're all looking for the secret--magic bullet--but it really just doesn't exist. This is just another book to get you excited for a little while but it will wear off quickly. Human behavior is the most difficult thing on the planet to change. Our eating habits begin in infancy and childhood and are unlikely to radically change in adulthood for any significant amt of time.
B0053F042G|4.0|If you found Deception a bit complicated and hard to follow, Source Code is much simpler and just as entertaining. Of course, there are lots of holes in the story line, but then time travel lends itself to that.  Jake is the romantic lead but looks sick and hungover.  But his eyes are still amazing so the love connection was not too hard to believe.<br /><br />Nice surprise of a movie we knew nothing about.

B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This was my first Bill Bryson book, and I was delightfully surprised by what a witty, knowledgeable, down-to-earth raconteur he is. I downloaded the sample to my Kindle and immediately started wishing there was someone sitting next to me to whom I could read his wonderfully humorous observations.<br /><br />The pace is somewhat meandering, as befits the tale of an extended joruney of exploration, but it's never dull. Bryson ranges throughout Australia, perpetually curious and game for adventure, more than willing to appreciate everything this amazing country has to offer. It's easy to imagine tramping or riding along beside him, listening to him share the fruits of his research, wondering just where you'll end up next.<br /><br />Even someone who has no interest in ever going to Australia will find this an engaging read.
B000W3Q1HG|4.0|This book has some of what I think are very valuable principals. I think this is a book that everyone would be able to gain something from by reading.<br /><br />I am a person of no religion and I found the use of the word \\"God\\" distracting. We all have a preconceived notion of what God is, so it was hard to clear my mind of it when mentioned. Other than that, the book had some wonderful gems of free thought.<br /><br />Technically, I found the writing was repetitive. Too much for my taste, but certainly a valid method of teaching. By the end of the book, I had the basics solidly implanted in my brain.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. In the end, it left me wanting to read more, which I feel is a good sign. I will read another style book next, but I will likely pick up one of his other books soon.

0393338959|4.0|Very detailed account of the housing boom and bust, leading to the 2008 recession, and the government's response. Was extremely interesting to learn about all of it from a prominent economist.     The writing was very readable but still intelligent, and Stiglitz is obviously a very smart and educated economist.     While many of Stiglitz's policy recommendations were well-written and insightful, I disagree with his emphasis on more stimulus as the end-all solution to economic crisis. Dealing with the long list of inefficiencies, lack of competition, unnecessary bureaucracy, and the short-sightedness and perhaps undereducation of politicians and voters should be just important, if not more important, than simply injecting more money into the system to pay off later.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|The title pretty much somes it up. I installed it and when my keyboard appears on my screen it is in the middle of the screen and not the bottom where it should be. Uninstalled and went back to my default that works perfectly.
B003Y5H59W|5.0|During World War II, Steve Rogers is eager to enlist to serve his country and defend it against invaders. But Steve is a scrawny 95 pound young man with asthma and a weak heart. But a doctor sees Steve's eagerness and determination and decides to give him a chance in a special experimental division of the army. There, Steve proves himself worthy and brave enough to be the first test subject for a super-soldier serum. Meanwhile, a Nazi scientific faction called Hydra has found a remarkable substance that just may change the course of the war.<br /><br />With extraordinary special effects and CGI, Chris Evans begins the film as a small, weak man. His transformation to Captain America is worth the price of admission alone. Evans completely embodies both Steve Rogers - the brave but bullied weakling to the strong super-soldier. Tommy Lee Jones plays Captain America's commanding officer to scene-stealing perfection. And supporting roles by Hayley Atwell (Agent Carter), Sebastian Stan (`Bucky' Barnes), Dominic Cooper (Howard Stark), and Stanley Tucci (Dr. Erskine) added humor and heart to the film. Hugo Weaving was chilling and brilliance as Johann Schmidt, the evil mastermind behind Hydra.<br /><br />The story takes place almost completely in 1942, with beautiful settings and Stark-infused technology and fun gadgets. With plenty of action, adventure, suspense, and laughs - fans of all ages will enjoy this fantastic re-imaging of an iconic super hero. It would have been easy to make this a simple action/adventure film, but the writers did an amazing job of infusing drama, patriotism, and light-hearted humor to balance the story. This comic book fan had high hopes and was not disappointed. Intrigue, excitement, and romance - the film is riveting from beginning to end.
0439023521|5.0|This series of books of the Hunger Games was really great reading - and I'm 64 yrs old. Maybe geared towards young adults but I thoroughly enjoyed all three books.
0525951652|4.0|This book is a good way to understand WWI from different points of view.  So many issues were brought out, women's suffrage, worker's rights, sons fearing to displease fathers, dishonest government.    The characters drew me in and I thought about them throughout the day. The women in particular are strong characters and Follet favors women in this story.     Reading the book was a little bit of a chore, it s very long, I usually listen to the longer ones on audio but sometimes I like the discipline of a long read. The pages went faster as I neared the end.  I love how he wrapped up the story yet left some holes to be developed n the next book.
0545259088|3.0|I was in love with the book Shiver. I probably read it in less than 2 days. I also enjoyed Linger and was really looking foward to Forever thinking that it would round out the trilogy and answer any lingering questions. As usual, I really enjoyed the writing. Maggie has a beautiful style that just brings her world and her character's emotions to life. But now that I'm finished I feel a little cheated and I actually have more questions than when I started! Please don't get me wrong- I have no issues with a book ending somewhat open ended so that the readers can make their own decision on the outcome, but this book had WAY too many unanswered questions.     SPOILERS AHEAD     I felt the character development with Isabel and Cole was really well done. I loved Cole's character. Sometimes I was a little disappointed with Sam (which makes me sad because I love Sam!) His inner monologe was a little too tedious at times. There were also some scenes with Sam and Grace that just felt akward (i.e. the first reunion between them). But overall, I really enjoyed most of the book...right up until the sudden abrubt end. I actually flipped back and forth on my Kindle several times because I thought for sure I had missed the epilogue somewhere.    I would have been okay if there were one or two questions left open, but after having readers dedicate their time to an entire triology I feel that we deserved a little better. Some of questions that were left: The obvious- will Grace survive the \\"cure\\"? Of course it was never even confirmed as a cure even though that was Cole's main focus the entire book. We were given the impression in Linger that Sam may not really be cured and then in Forever Cole gives him the injection that turns him back into a wolf so is he cured or is he not?  Is Sam off the hook with the police about Oliva or are we just supposed to assume that because Grace was no longer missing they didn't suspect him even though Oliva was found on his property? Who were the other wolves that died and what happened to other wolves that were always mentioned as part of Beck's pack? What happens between Cole and Isabel or does she just move away and hope that he'll call? Nothing was ever really resolved with Grace's parents. And are we really to believe that after 3 books of trying to destroy the wolves that Tom Culpepper just leaves after only killing some of them? It didn't seem to me that the pack would be that hard for him to track down. I could list a few more...     Maybe I was just expecting too much. I gave it 3 stars because I love Maggie's writing and enjoyed most of it until so much was left up in the air.
0517548232|5.0|Very easy to read, simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric. I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it. I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading, but it's not necessary, and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their well-being is easier to measure and is effected more immediately (aka every modern economic issue) has an obligation to read this book.
0439023521|5.0|To be honest? I liked \\"The Hunger Games\\". It's not a perfect book, but with one of the strongest leading characters I've encountered in young adult fiction in a while, a wildly entertaining story, several brutally fun scenes and punchy writing, the story bounces along, drawing the reader in immediately and hardly giving a moment's rest. This is not a book to set aside.<br /><br />Katniss, the main character, is one of the best-drawn female characters I've met in recent years, particularly in the young adult category. She is strong and impressive, remarkably original and appealing. She's not the stereotypically all-talented female heroine of most fantasies but rather a well-rounded young woman with strengths and weaknesses. She succeeds in part through the talents of those around her, as well as sheer will. Fitting the context of the book, Katniss is bursting with the drive to live and strive on. There is little sweet about her, little that makes her \\"easy to relate to\\". And yet one does find themselves drawn into her world, even if without necessarily liking her. I didn't fully like Katniss, but I did admire her on some level.<br /><br />I cannot say quite the same of the other characters in \\"The Hunger Games\\". Peeta, Katniss' regional partner and counterpart, is a much less developed character, remaining far more pencil-sketched than even some two-second characters. Those characters that disappeared as quickly as they appeared were the ones I was disappointed to leave so quickly, but plot is plot and this book is... mostly plot.<br /><br />It's not even that the story is particularly original. It's not. Nor is it necessarily surprising. It's that the book keeps the reader hooked right from the start, interested to know how it all ends. There are twists and turns along the way, but they aren't particularly suspenseful... they're enjoyable. They're exciting. Things are bloody and gruesome and intense and exciting... and just plain fun.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced book bursting with excitement and bloody fun. It's not necessarily the best-written book and bland characters like Peeta bring down the tone a little, but it's certainly well worth a read.<br /><br />Recommended.nd bloody fun. It's not necessarily the best-written book and bland characters like Peeta bring down the tone a little, but it's certainly well worth a read.    Recommended.
B0048IMZMG|1.0|Each song in Speak Now sounds the same.  Hear the first song; no need to hear the rest.  If you like good country music, this is not the album for you.  I wouldn't call it country; it's more like a poor attempt at pop-rock.  I had difficulty listening to the whole album. This is a collection of high school girl drama songs.  Her uneducated flat notes will annoy you from beginning to end. Don't waste your time or your money.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Before you watch this film, you need to know that in no way should this film be considered a film \\"sequel\\" to the original Wizard of Oz movie. You won't be able to get past certain glaring differences, such as Dorothy seeming to have become younger even though she's already been to Oz.<br /><br />This film is dark and should probably be watched alone before showing it to young children, but it's an amazingly well done dark fantasy film. I used to watch this movie a lot back in the 1990s and bought the DVD a few years back. It's still a great fantasy adventure film. So many parts of it are great, memorable scenes, such as Dorothy and the lunch pail tree, Princess Mombi's heads, the delicacies that the Nome King offers Dorothy, and the last trial she faces to find the Scarecrow.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Nice short stories, great to read on a plane (where I get most of my reading done)  Well written.  A classic.
0553801473|4.0|A Dance with Dragons is wonderful, and I'm sure even more so the second time around, once Martin's two last books are finished.<br /><br />Because there is SO MUCH happening, so many characters, so many arcs, the plot doesn't move very far.<br /><br />His story is like a glacier.  Huge and awe-inspiring, ripping forwards through the land, but watching it one day at a time, you don't see much movement.<br /><br />Like AFFC, it's brother, ADWD is wonderfully written and wonderfully woven.  Like ASOIAF, the number one requirement for enjoying it is patience.<br /><br />Having re-read the series in anticipation of ADWD's release, I found myself warming considerably more to AFFC, where-as the first time I read it I found it lacking.  I realized that it's because it ends to early.  Being the middle, these books beg for the ends, but they aren't here yet.<br /><br />My advice.  Wait.  You've waited so long.  Wait until the series is finished before you pick it up again.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|Loved the read.  Minus a star due to the sex scenes.  Not explicit, just seemed forced - and not necessary.
0140282033|3.0|\\"Chocolate - a novel\\" tells a dark tale of persecution, stubbornness, conformity and vanity in the name of religion, community pride, and personal relationships. The movie version of this story was the basis of a Lenten-themed Sunday sermon by my Pastor. That sermon led me to buy the DVD; the movie led me to buy the book. However, the book is much darker, and the story-line is different than the movie. This story is well told through the novel and the movie as it follows the life of a gypsy-style mother and daughter - just in different tones. I like the movie better - it has some darkness, but is more lighthearted and comes across as a romantic drama/comedy. The book, while well written, is a little too dark for my taste. I think the movie gets the same points across but with less attitude. This book would be a great Book Club selection because of it's darkness; many themes and life choices to discuss. The book stays in my personal library to be re-read on occasion.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I didn't know who Bethany Hamilton was when I saw this movie.  She is now an inspiration to me.  This movie sucks you in from moment one.  It has a great cast.  I love how they put God, worship, and trials to face into this movie.  My most favorite line in the movie is when her mom and her were lying on her bed and she asked \\"Mom, what guy will ever want me like this?\\"  And her mom replied...well watch the movie and you will know :-)

0071762345|5.0|Likeable Social Media is a great handbook to understanding and using social media to grow your business.    Dave Kerpen guides you step by step on not just the \\"how\\" of marketing on Facebook and Twitter but the \\"why\\". Using real-life examples and a welcome lack of jargon, the concepts, and how to execute them, are clear and concise.  There are plenty of \\" why didn't I think of that\\" ideas, at the same time Dave never over promises.  He also tackles difficult subjects like how to quantify the impact of social media marketing.  The appendix is a great cheat sheet on the strengths and purposes of different social sites. And to top it off, the author commits to answer any questions you have about the book.    If you are the marketing professional or a freelancer just starting a business, this book provides great insight on how to make your business more appealing to current and future customers via social media.

B0045LK31Q|5.0|I am a huge fan of David Gilmour. This album is not in my top ten for Gilmour..but it is still a good listen. For $10 you can't beat it. As other reviews have stated, its just a relaxed jam session. If your a Floyd fan then buy this album, you won't be disappointed.

B005DD7H50|5.0|LIMITLESS, is unlimited in its delivery of entertainment above and beyond what you'd normally expect for a movie that got hardly any hype.     Visuals, special effects, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, boy loses girl again......it will keep you amazed,with every twist and turn.  The plot is  faithful to the title, and the film will take you all the way to motion picture enjoyment.    And just when you think you're out, and they've dragged you back in again, [Limitless] delivers the blow that allows your post viewing imagination to sore with the [endless possibilities] of where the future lies for the hapless hero and his, uh oh, almost gave away too much.    Watch this one and you'll thank me for not saying another word about how great this film really is.

B0040QYROK|5.0|This 1927 German expressionist film by Fritz Lang is well ahead of its time. Paramount Pictures edit the film before being released in the United States, but now it is complete. It conveys an interesting look at how life has been and is today. Bottom line, We the people are the gears that move the economy, and without us (NOT POLITICIANS) it cannot survive. Enjoy this great masterpiece!
B000002HJR|5.0|The New Orleans based band Down released their debut album NOLA all the way back in 1995 and over the years it has moved from a sort of cult classic to one of the essential heavy metal albums of our time.<br /><br />Down brought together Phil Anselmo, Pepper Keenan, Kirk Windstein and surprisingly Jimmy Bower on drums to play a sort of sludge and southern rock influenced stoner rock style.<br /><br />NOLA, named after the band's New Orleans Louisiana roots, contains many of the band's most loved songs, from the likes of big rocking songs such as `Lifer,' `Bury Me In Smoke,' and `Hail To The Leaf,' to softer more contemplative moments like `Jail,' and `Pray For The Locust.'<br /><br />The album has no weak links, basically every track is a classic and the majority of the album is played live to this day which should speak volumes of about its quality.<br /><br />As well as inspired songwriting, and great performances, the album has an exceptional production job, almost years ahead of its time. The album sounds big and meaty, with an immense drum sound yet at the same time sounds like an old undiscovered vinyl gem from back in the 70s.<br /><br />NOLA may come from a pretty esteemed pedigree, but at the same time actual manages to still be greater than the sum of its parts. If you have the slightest interest in Down or even just in the genre, you really need to check this album out.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|This is a great app!<br /><br />The ability to mix up to 3 tracks really gives you an amazing amount of variety.<br /><br />I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is no way to save your settings.<br /><br />A great app and well worth the 2 bucks!
0743201140|3.0|I was hoping that it's a bit more comprehensive, like the myers briggs, it's fun but doesn't tell you much beyond explaining the individual strengths. you get your top 5 but they don't tell you what that means together, just individually by each strength.
0062060554|4.0|My title says it all.<br /> Definitely has flaws, which I will not reveal as it will \\"spoil the suspense\\". However, definitely a gripping, unputdownable novel. Could have done away with some of the repetition, though overall very very interesting.
1433502399|5.0|I have been using this Bible for three years now and out of the forty plus study Bibles that I own - it's become my favorite. It's simply loaded with great articles, study notes, and phenomenal tools to help you understand the meaning of the text and go deeper in your understanding and application of the Bible. Also, the ESV is an excellent translation that makes for easy reading and a trustworthy rendering of the Hebrew and Greek originals. I can't recommend this study Bible highly enough as a MUST HAVE resource for all lovers of God's Word!
B0011ZVL10|5.0|Down's third album, Down III: Over The Under was released in 2007 as the band evolved beyond the point of being a super group side project and started being a bone-fide heavy metal institution.<br /><br />The New Orleans based band released their first album back in 1995 and their second in 2002. Twelve years after their inception, their third album continues on their formula of sludge and southern rock influenced stoner rock.<br /><br />Over The Under stands apart in Down's catalogue in that by and large, the music is often faster and more metal orientated in places than the band's previous two albums. This is not so grand a change as to be labeled a departure however, just a slight shift in focus.<br /><br />The album is chocked full of big riffs, memorable choruses and a real stompy quality that makes it a joy to listen to. This, coupled with the terrific Sabbathy production job and some of the band's best lyrics to date makes Over The Under a seriously good album.<br /><br />Stand out tracks include the live favourite `N.O.D,' the powerful `In The Thrall Of It All,' and the intense `Beneath The Tides.'<br /><br />Phil Anselmo's voice is powerful and varied enough to carry the entire album from harsher more metal sections, to softer bluesy moments and everything inbetween. His often imitated but never bettered style gives the band an utterly unique quality that separates them from the many bands playing sludge or stoner metal.<br /><br />If anyone thinks that Down have gotten a free ride on the back of Pantera's legacy, one listen to Over The Under should convince them otherwise. Down are an excellent band and this album is definitely worth your time and money.

031603438X|3.0|This is a book about Keith Richards first and foremost.  I enjoyed reading it and gained more of an insight about Keith Richards the man.  Unfortunately, there was not much about the Stones as a group or the individual members with the exception of Mick.  He does go into a lot of detail on his relationship with Jagger which I found interesting.  I would have liked more details on Brian Jones (the founder of the Rolling Stones), Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts.  Too much time dedicated to dope and some of the odd characters Keith met and hung out with.      Hard core Stones fans will enjoy \\"Life\\" but casual fans and those looking for a general overview of the band would do better by reading one of the many books about the Rolling Stones.  Here's a few really good ones: Bill Wyman's \\"Stone Alone\\", \\"The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones\\" by Stanley Booth, Philip Norman's \\"The Stones\\", \\"Old Gods Almost Dead\\" by Stephen Davis, and two excellent but hard to find books(out of print): \\"Symphony for the Devil: The Rolling Stones Story\\" by Philip Norman and \\"Our Own Story by The Rolling Stones\\" (probably the best account of the birth of the group next to Wyman's book).      Honorable mention and excellent reads: \\"Mick Jagger: Everybody's Lucifer\\" by Anthony Scaduto, \\"Nankering With the Stones\\", by James Phelge, and David Dalton's \\"The Rolling Stones: The First Twenty Years.\\"
B005D9MUWY|2.0|It works ok and it looks nice but it is nothing special... Swype is so much easier to use. Meh

B00381PPEO|4.0|Down released their second album Down II: A Bustle In Your Hedgerow in 2002 to a less favorable reaction than any of their other albums.<br /><br />The New Orleans based band released their previous album first album all the way back in 1995 and this second album had a hard time living up to the cult classic.<br /><br />Down II delivers the band's trademark formula of sludge and southern rock influenced stoner rock; this time in what people may call a looser, bluesy and more jam-orientated atmosphere. This looseness was a large part of the reason Down II wasn't met with the same universal praise as their debut album NOLA.<br /><br />The so called loose atmosphere doesn't put me off at all, partly because it sounds fun and partly because it is only really present on a few tracks anyway and I feel it was unfairly seized upon as a reason to dislike the album.<br /><br />The album is still full to the brim with the sort of big riffs and memorable choruses that make the band so great. Tracks like `Ghosts Along The Mississippi,' `Beautifully Depressed,' and `New Orleans is a Dying Whore,' are among the finest the band have yet to release.<br /><br />I feel the track `Stained Glass Cross,' in particular deserves special attention, with it shuffling verse and soulful chorus, the track is almost reminiscent of Clutch. Its one of the most memorable tracks on the album and musically is completely unique within the Down catalogue.<br /><br />In summary, Down II may be the public's least favourite Down album, but the band are so good that still leaves it as an amazing record, containing a large chunk of the band's live repertoire. If you like anything by Down you really ought to get a hold of this album too.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I went back and forth on reading this book for a week. I knew from the news stories that Jaycee was kept as a \\"sex slave\\" for 18 years and I honestly didn't want to read in graphic detail what happened to her. Details like that are really hard for me to hear about. That being said, all the other reviews talk about how her spirit and the hope she keeps alive really makes this book worth reading. I completely agree.     Not to diminish her experience, and the details were brutal and graphic, but it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I am not saying the rapes were not horrible, I am saying that the whole book was not one detail filled account after another. I only bring this up to let others know this book is worth reading.     Jaycee is a survivor, she is inspirational, and her story needs to be heard.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I'm going to be fast.  This book totally sucks compared to the previous three.  I won't give any spoilers, but just by flipping through the book, and looking at the chapter titles, you will quickly realize that this book is about the characters that you don't care about.  Forget about the incredibly interesting Arya Stark story line(like one or two chapters).  Don't expect to read about Bran or Jon.  And especially forget about dragons.      I, like everyone else, will power through this book(i'm halfway through now, and am thinking of flipping through the rest), but be prepared to be disappointed.  In fact, that's why I'm writing a review now.  I wanted to read other's reviews to see if it got any better.  And it doesn't look like it.     I know this sounds harsh, but I really don't think I've exaggerated, and have definitely not given any spoilers.  But don't expect the typical fighting with yourself to put the book down and finally get some sleep.  In fact, some of these chapters have actually put me to sleep.
0345529057|5.0|Watched the first season of the TV show and I had to read the books. I have read the first two books so far and I am completely loving this collection. Awesome story line and you never know what is going to happen next. The fact that the story is told from each person's own perspective is what I love the most.
0634022296|5.0|It is reasonably compact, and each song only takes a page or too.  And the chords seem to be very accurate.  Yes, it won't lie flat, but I just take it to a copy store such as Kinko's and have them add a spiral binding.  It's not expensive.      If you need to know exactly what notes were played or sung, get The Beatles - Complete Scores (best $50 I ever spent).  If you are singing and playing the tunes with people who have some idea how they go, this is a much more convenient format. I have both, and it's worth it (to me).

0439023483|5.0|I am 14 years old. The first time I read The Hunger Games and the subsequent trilogy, it was shocking,  fast paced, thrilling, slightly militaristic in the later books, and made me cry more than once. The second time I read the series, it lost some of its thrill factor, but I saw the story with a much more critical eye, thinking about what I would do in Katniss's place and reading the seemingly effortless care that was put into every word. The third time I read them, most recently, I cracked Katniss. All at once, she (and the other characters, too) became the most real and complex characters I have ever had the privilege of reading.   And every single time that I read them, they literally had to be ripped from my hands by fatigue or calling mothers and later kept me awake for hours, replaying the scenes in my head. As an aspiring writer myself, I can only dream of not only touching but completely devouring my readers in this way.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I use it daily, it's awesome. Give it some time to learn how you type. Only wish I have to be able to turn off a second language and swap between them... sometimes it's annoying to have German pop up when I want only English, overall it's a great keyboard, though.

B004LWZW24|4.0|Like Paranormal Activity, this story really got under my skin and gave me some chills at night because of the dynamic of people being attacked in their home, despite a security system.  Even children are at risk--actually, more at risk than their parents are--of being taken and possessed by demonic entities.  The idea of not even being safe in your own bed is what bothers me more than the usual bogeyman stories.<br /><br />The actors are convincingly frightened or frightening here, and the effects are pretty decent as well.
0060751967|3.0|Stealing this rating system from another reviewer:    1.) Can't put it down, stay up all night, cancel dinner  2.) Can't wait to finish it, but can function  3.) Have a difficult time getting into and finishing it but  end up enjoying the story anyhow  4.) Can't get past the first third of book throw it away/donate or sell it without finishing     I'd say that this book was close to #3 for me, which also fits my star-rating.  I'd say the better description for me is \\"No difficulty getting into it but hoping it would turn out to be better than it was.\\"  Of the many vampire/human romance stories out there, this one is entertaining but not as well-written as others.  I think it leaned a little too close to the \\"romance novel\\" genre for my liking.  I like sex as much as the next person, but I guess I like sex in books to be more subtle than in this novel.  The lead vampire, Roman, is the typical tall, dark, handsome, rich, powerful, etc. that you expect from the modern romantic lead vampires.  The lead female human is not exactly the typical lead female in that she's described as less attractive than most lead female humans in these types of novels.  Not saying that's a good or bad thing, just how it is in this book.  She's likeable enough although I couldn't get behind her the way I have with other lead females (like Rose in The Vampire Academy series or Katniss in The Hunger Games).
0553801473|3.0|\\"Is it good?\\"<br /><br />I got asked this by my brother who has only seen the show and saw me reading the newest book. Since obviously I couldn't discuss much with him, but he still wanted to know, as everyone else has been wanting to know:<br /><br />\\"Is it good?\\"<br /><br />Yes it's good. It's better than a Feast for Crows by virtue of it's characters alone. But wow, it's also incredibly frustrating. Sorry for the quick change of mood there, but that's exactly what it's like to read this book. Moments will make you snap to attention and instantly remember why you've waited so long for the series, and how you loved it in the first place. This book has the power to draw you away from your world and into its. But these are but brief illuminations in a dark and often blindly led journey.<br /><br />Dance's biggest problem is it's pacing, which is to say stop and go. Whenever you think something major is about to happen, the book seems intent at preventing it. And yet this is a gargantuan of a novel. What makes up the extra space in between actual happenings? Exposition and traveling.  So much of what is spoken could have only been mentioned and still had the same effect. Take for instance every Victarion Greyjoy chapter. Are the iron born interesting? Yes they are and very much so. Is there any amount of information in his chapters that couldn't have been neatly condensed into one? No.<br /><br />This becomes a problem later on when things should be picking up but never seem to. There is hardly a character in this book that doesn't seemingly have their story end one chapter (or more) too short. And not in the \\"I must know what happens next\\" way, but rather in the \\"I fear this may be another six year cliffhanger\\" manner. Then there is the almost laughable cases of Bran and Davos. I swear to the seven that I flipped back through the book just to make sure that I didn't somehow miss more of their chapters. Let me save you the time. You didn't<br /><br />The other major problem is actually some of the characters themselves. Yes, they are much better than the ones we got in Feast for Crows, but only barely. The biggest offender is no other than Tyrion himself. His story is long, mildly eventful, sometimes utterly bizarre (in ways good and bad), but worst of all (and I can't believe I'm writing this) it's humorless. A chuckle here and there maybe, but for the most part Martin loses his way with Tyrion's dialogue. Danerys sadly fairs much the same. She (and Tyrion for that matter) has some INCREDIBLE moments in this book, but for the most part she spends her time spinning her wheels and kicking up mud all around here the whole time. Yet again, it's all in an effort to end the story in an interesting place and then take what may happen away for another day. Which leads us to Jon Snow. The strongest of the three major characters, Jon's story sees him discovering leadership as well as himself as a person. It's a good story with some great little moments, and even in its' drawn out passages it still seems the most driven. Yet it ends with not only a cliffhanger for his own situation, but the ones of others as well who don't get their own final chapters.<br /><br />There's also a problem with new additions. I'll be brief. Tyrion meets an uninteresting dwarf woman who gets much dialogue and time, Danerys is practically surrounded by a cast of \\"who?\\"s that you get to know and become \\"who cares\\"?, many sell sword companies are introduced out of the blue and now have quite a bit of sway. None of those compare to the holy mother of \\"huh?\\" characters however. For the sake of extreme spoilers I will not mention the name, but the character comes right out of the blue and can completely change everything that has been done so far. I hope there is a satisfying reasoning to this...surprise and it wasn't just done to give us a mini-me version of a well dead character we could never have, but I fear the later.<br /><br />Yet I give this book 3 stars, and I say it is good. That's because it is. For instance take the surprising quality of the Reek chapters. By now, I'm going to assume it's no major spoiler to say that Reek is Theon Greyjoy. It might be a spoiler however to let you know that his chapters might be the best in the book. They are purposeful, deliberate, and constantly interesting. They also introduce us to some fantastic new villains in the Boltons, and just for hell he becomes a rallying point of sorts for other major characters. In Theon's story you will find that old magic once again that the first three books had in spades.<br /><br />He's not the only one. Davos and Bran may be cut short, but what's there is great. The activities of King Stannis and those around him are always interesting and make for some of the best intrigue in the book. Asha Greyjoy has a short but sweet story that puts her in an active position within the overall story. Ser Barristan Selmy has a few very, very good chapters. And while I still find Tyrion's chapters to be boring, Jon and Danerys overall provide the major plots of this tale, and both contribute enough to make it worth while. The best characters though? The precious few chapters we get from the Feast for Crows gang. Not only do they advance the unresolved plots of Jamie, Cersei, and No One, but they are also some of the best written of the bunch further suggesting that Martin knows where he going with the plot, but that he needed these last two books to turn a real big ship around to get there.<br /><br />Then there are those moments. In fact I retract my earlier statement. It's not the characters that make this better than a Feast for Crows, it's those damn moments. This installment spreads them around more liberally than its' predecessor did, and is the much better for it. This book feels more alive than A Feast for Crows, even when it's just shuffling it's feet. Plus like I said, it may take a while to get there but by the end of this book the whole overall plot feels much more on track and focused. Oh and that last chapter? Gravy. Pure indulgence and a fantastic bookend to both fully hype you for book six and remind you the power Martin still wields with a pen over your very soul and even your expectations.<br /><br />Ultimately I may have fallen under the same curse as Martin and spoke too many words. Because you will read this book and you very much should. Ultimately some will say that the wait was too long for too much unresolved. Maybe that's true. But as a whole and judged on it's own this is a more than solid entry into the Ice and Fire series and, while not destined to become everyone's favorite, is still a hard work of fiction to out right hate.<br /><br />But George, can I sum up quickly what fans want for Winds of Winter?<br /><br />More Dragons, Less Dancing.
0385512104|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I could not put it down.  I love how the author really put the reader into Christopher's mind.  It really made you have an understanding of how the mind of someone who has Aspergers works.  Now, I know that this is now how every person with Aspergers thinks, but I truly is a fantastic insight.  As a teacher at a school that has a specialized Autism unit, I truly believe this will be a great tool for students.  Sometimes it is hard for some students to understand why students with autism react they way do in certain situations, and I know that book would be a great guide for opening up discussion in the classroom.    This is definitely a must read!
0375842209|5.0|There just aren't enough words for how much I loved this book. So how do I express how I love this book? First off, The language and POV is phenomenal, here is a quote for you; \\"The moon was sewn into the sky that night, clouds were stitched around it.\\"  this book is full of this kind of intricate and completely beautiful language and shows such a mastery of words.  Second, the POV of death gives the story a poignant view of the atrocities of the Holocaust and World War Two. His narration is slightly snarky but also understanding and insightful makes the horrible burden of the Holocaust not as suffocatingly real and depressing WW II stories can be. Zusak created a complicated world with many different moving parts seamlessly blended them together to create a heart-wrenching and beautiful story set in Nazi Germany. I would tell anyone with a passion for beatifully uniquely written literature or  with an interest in a very different kind of Holocaust story to read this book. I would just tell everyone to read this book. It's that good. It's a masterpiece!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show is brilliantly bleak, occasionally humorous, and still provocative.  Walt may be in remission, but his life as a meth cook is ever more complicated, with more bad and deadly people getting involved, Jesse dealing with a support group and his constant temptations to do the wrong things for money, Skyler finding out what her husband has been up to, and the brother in law being seriously injured after coming close to finding out just who Heisenberg really is.      Bryan Cranston is a stone-cold genius, and the cast is equally impressive.   Great soundtrack too.

0783225857|5.0|I saw \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" several times on TV.  Still, I had to buy this DVD.  I watched it yet again, and it was still fresh and enjoyable.  (\\"Enjoyable\\" might be the wrong word, here.  I think \\"disturbing\\" might be truer.)  Gregory Peck plays a widower with a young daughter, who live in the South.  As an attorney, he is defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. The story is hard to watch, at times, but it delves deep into the best of men and the worst of men.  I think the movie is a realistic view of the place and time, perfectly cast, not corny or sappy.  If anyone hasn't seen this movie (and I supposed that some younger people may not have), it is well worth your while to do so. It is definitely a keeper for me.
0307346617|4.0|The book stars off immediately with an account of one of the survivors and takes off from there. The thought and details that goes into every page is astounding. He must have spent alot of time imagining the world and how it would be because its very imaginitive and cleverly set up. The things I didn't like were some of the characters, some acted very absurd. Since the book is written in an interview perspective, it does not allow you to be with the characters from beginning to end and you don't feel as invested. The this book is still very well written thanks to Max Brooks and Its a very suspenseful account of what could happen during a zombie apocalypse, Its very good overall and I recommend World War Z.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Cooper  does a nice job in this story of a man who discovers a drug that will allow his mental capacity to expand considerably, making him a faster writer, a card counter at poker, and a very savvy financial guru whose talents unfortunately attract some bad guys who want a piece of what he has.

0670022411|3.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said by others? The protagonist of this story, Diana Bishop, does indeed sleep, a LOT, in this book. And eat. And drink lots of tea. In between is a lot of romance novel cliches and pseudo intellectualism. Diana is descended from a Salem witch family (they really were REAL witches, not just people accused of witchcraft and executed wrongly) and is the most powerful witch ever. But she doesn't know it. Matthew, her vampire love-interest, is the tallest, handsomest, most sophisticated, most graceful dancer, richest, most charming, etc. etc. ad nauseum. Yes, yes... it's all nice to fantasize about the \\"perfect\\" man but without some faults and flaws and imperfections (and I'm not including his dining habits in this), he seems a very one dimensional character.  And despite his British accent (I \\"read\\" the audio version), he's actually FRENCH.  Why French?  Didn't Anne Rice already do that? How about Polish or Armenian or Irish even? No - French.<br />Now onto something the others have not seemed to have touched on.  The horses. In the stable at Matthew's castle (you KNEW there had to be a castle, didn't you?) Diana is introduced to the horses. Oh, and Matthew had considerately obtained riding clothes for her including a pair of tall riding boots which her family could never afford when she was young. Oh, she was a rider and apparently can ride ANY horse, but with all the money spent on riding lessons, they couldn't buy her boots. She tells Matthew she was into \\"jumping and dressage\\" (prounounced DRESS-age by the reader, not dreSAHzh which is the correct pronunciation). So she learned to jump and practiced dressage, but never had tall boots. Custom made boots ARE expensive, however off-the rack boots are not that bad, and most tack shops carry second-hand pairs that are quite affordable. During another visit to the barn Matthew's percheron stallion \\"catches an apple\\" that Diana tosses to him. Uh... what?  Horses are not DOGs. They don't catch tidbits of food in midair like a dog catching a bit of steak.  I do wish the author would not write about what she obviously doesn't KNOW about. There were other indications of the author's lack of knowledge of horses. If there is a book #2, hopefully she may speak to some horse owners prior to writing about horses.<br />This book could have been good - there were elements that could have been expanded on, and occasionally a segment would grab me but then it would fall flat again with more tea, food, sleep, phone calls, hugging, etc.  If you like vampire romance fiction, you may enjoy it, but please, take it out at the library and save your money.<br />If you are interested in reading about alchemy, I'd recommend \\"The Chymical Wedding\\", by Lindsay Clarke.<br />Towards of end of this book (alert! spoiler!) Diana and her vampire time travel to the past to escape danger from those who think witches and vampires should not become romantically involved (sounds like 1950's racism story redone for paranormal creatures, doesn't it?). If you like this sort of thing Diana Gabaldon's Voyager series has already done the time travel thing and quite well. Also, for a book that has a \\"love in the long ago\\" theme, read Anya Seton's \\"Green Darkness\\". No time travelling here, but remembrance of a past life in Tudor England.<br />Having said all this, I likely will read part II if it is published and put on audio, and hopefully the author will give a little more substance and less nonsense. To the author -  please - no more \\"she placed the cookies on the table\\" etc. descriptions of acts and statements that add nothing to the story and just seem like filler.

0307454541|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a top-notch thriller. It doesn't have any dull moments and it engages you with the complexity of the characters. You get immersed in the details  that Stieg Larsson gives in his descriptions of Lisbeth Salander's mind. The writer writes down many of the main character's thoughts, along with the impeccable dialogue in which they are immersed, serve as a backdrop that enriches the story and breathes new life into it. Larsson doesn't shy away from being explicit in the book. They are scenes which are depicted with exquisite detail that will terrify or shake you badly. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a must read to anyone who enjoys an immersing, thrilling and entertaining novel. It is a very serious page turner with one of the most interesting literature characters of all-time, Lisbeth Salander. I highly recommend this novel.
030746363X|5.0|From reading in the book and from reading reviews, this book has a target audience.  it is not meant for those people who already work out and eat right and are looking to lose that last 20 pounds.  This book is for fat people who have poor diets, or for those of us lazy people who know we should be eating better and exercising more.    The best advice I got from the book was the protein intake.  Eating 30 grams for breakfast and eating more throughout the day helped kick start my weight loss.      Bottom line.....if you are a workout person and have tried other diets and know what healthy eating is, you wont get much from this book.  If you are overweight and want to get started with definite results, this book will help.    No book can change your habits for you, and most of it is common sense.  Watch what you eat, no sugar, high protein, good carbs, smaller portions, healthy snacks like jerky or nuts, etc.  Exercise at least 3 times a week even if it is only walking around the block.    It is not rocket science.
0062060554|5.0|The main character, Christine, wakes every morning with no memory of the last 20 years of her life.  Think of the movie _50 First Dates_ projected 20 years into the future.  But this book is not as happy and fluffy as the movie.  There is a good deal of mystery involved as the reader reconstructs Christine's life at the same time and pace that she does herself.    For 3/4 of the book, I thought I had it all figured out, but boy, was I wrong!  This is an awesome debut by S.J. Watson, and I hope he writes more books of this quality in the future.

0385737955|5.0|When I finished this book I was exhausted-in a good way! The Maze Runner is charged with energy, and gets your adrenaline pumping right up to the last page. It is the excellent pacing that creates a very quick read. James Dashner has given The Maze Runner a very terrifying concept that could give you nightmares at night. Seriously, get ready for your heart to race. There are some minor things that could have made this book a masterpiece. For one, I found there to be too many characters that were not fully fleshed out but to be fair, the group of boys are suffering from amnesia so its very easy to forgive James Dashner. A terrifying imagination Dashner has. He knows how to make dystopian novels and I can't wait to read The Scorch Trials. I highly recommend this wonderful book.

0375842209|4.0|This was the first novel I had read in over a year.  A friend of mine let me borrow it, and I must say...I don't want to give it back.  It was definitely good enough for me to want to put in my collection.  I had never read a book by Markus Zusak until this one, which took me 5 nights of reading to knock it out (yes, I am a bedtime reader), and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I plan to start reading I am the Messenger tonight.
0439023521|5.0|I was never a big fan of YA books, but I'd heard alot of great things about The Hunger Games so I decided to give it a shot. Man, how wrong I was to try to ignore this trilogy and jump the bandwagon sooner. This book has it all, thrilling action, suspenseful drama and not cheesy romance! Katniss Everdeen is the heroine and she is a strong, independant, courageous, and very controversial character in the Hunger Games. There's A whole lot of characters in these books and Suzanne Collins did a very good job with setting them apart from eachother. Haymitch is totally my favorite character because he is so tragically messed up in the beginning but you can't help but feel for him when you know what he's all been through. The writing and dialogue is great and Collins really knows how to make an epic adventure into words. I don't want to spoil the plot for you so I won't talk about it. I loved reading The Hunger Games and you should read it too, its one of my favorite books of the year.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I saw the non 3D version of this movie when it came out and absolutely loved it.  Waited to purchase the collector's edition on Blu-ray and got a really good deal on amazon.  I must say this movie looks better to me on my HD tv and Blu-ray player then it did in the movies!  The colors are crisp and vibrant.  I love the behind the scenes and making of this movie.  If you are a fan of this movie, then this is a must have.  In my opinion, Blu-ray is the only way to watch this movie! Enjoy!
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Bon Iver is folk. Bon Iver is rock. Bon Iver is soul. Who/what is Bon Iver? He is everything that conveys heartfelt emotions. That voice can move you anyway.<br />For Emma, Forever Ago is soulfully introspective. Not one song defines who he is or what the album is like. The album is a continuous prose; the more you listen to it, the more you feel with it.<br />Loving this!

B004LWZW24|2.0|This film totally builds you up for suspense then pulls the plug on it.  In short this film is totally idiotic, and sadly pretty funny.  The Exorcist, which I thought pretty much sucked, is alot better than this film.  Don't waste your money like I did.  Rent it before you decide whether to buy it.  Or better yet pass it by completely.  There are much better horror films out there.  The Shining comes to mind.
1451629184|5.0|This book is an incredibly moving memoir.  On reading some of the few critical reviews, I feared I might be bored by stuff about pets.  However, one has to accept that pets loomed large in her life, so her memoir has to include a lot about pets, just as a president's memoir has to include a lot about politics.  I would add that the 14 pages on her cat Eclipse are actually photocopies of her own handwriting as a child: so they include relatively few words and take little time to read, but I thought they brought one closer to the child in captivity that she was than almost anything else.    Some reviewers would like more on what happened in her own family's life while she was in captivity, and more on her current life.  All of that would be very interesting, and maybe one day she or someone else will write a book that covers these other matters, and perhaps also includes some psychological analysis.  But this is her memoir about the stolen part of her life, and as such it is riveting; like many other reviewers, I found it hard to put down until I reached the end.      Some people feel the book could have been better written, but I was delighted it was in her own words: this makes it far more valuable and interesting as an eyewitness account.  There is also more to the writing than meets the eye.  For example, the first line of the introduction tells us her name, and this seems unbelievably mundane.....until her rescue when its significance is huge. There is also the time she visits Nancy in prison and Nancy hopes her mom will forgive her; Jaycee's reply was a brilliant understatement.          The one thing I kept hoping for was a little more about how her daughters coped in captivity.  I hope the reasons that this is not much discussed are because this is her memoir, not theirs, and because she is anxious to protect their privacy.  However, they must have a mountain to climb in adapting to their new life, and perhaps the most cheering thought is that they could not have anyone better than their mother to help them.  But one of the many things that was stolen from them was the knowledge that she was their mother, and who knows what adjustment problems this may create.  Perhaps one day they will write a memoir of a stolen childhood; it, too, would surely be a best-seller.  Meanwhile, good luck to all of them.

B00005MM01|5.0|i've had the bgo version of \\"a gift from a flower to a garden\\" for years.  It actually came out in 1993.  This is the version i have listened to for all this time and am quite used to.  Interestingly i have had 2 different versions of this album on LP.  One as a Pye release from the UK and one from the US.  I love recording records onto cd but never really got around to recording \\"a gift from a flower to a garden\\" onto cd from the record.  I finally did do tonight.  To my surprise the LP i have is stereo and the BGO cd i have is mono.  I was pleasently surprised by the new nuisances i've head from the stereo lp tonight.  I suppose there is a stereo version of this out by now.  I wish when they re-released albums like Mellow Yellow with bonus tracks that they did the same with this album.  It is by far my favorite.

B0025KW29U|5.0|I personally don't own the blu-ray - yet - but there really is need to own the disc to review it. Dr. Horrible is nothing short of the best film production to come out of 2008, if not one of the best modern musicals ever. Not only does Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible prove that the internet and independent film-makers can succeed in a bigger way than ever expected, without the big-league companies supporting them, but it did so in a way that I personally feel should make those same companies fear for their future. Of course, the success of Dr. Horrible isn't random - Joss Whedon is one of the most talented directors in the business. His family as well as Neil Patrick Harris, who is honestly a terrific actor and has a surprisingly infectious voice, in addition to Nathan Fillion, a fan favorite, and Felicia Day who is already a popular internet star, all came together to make this production bleed with quality.    The story itself is excellent and deeper than you would expect for a 42 minute musical - where the eponymous villain actually turns out to be not only the protagonist, but also the hero and the most loveable character in the whole production. Unfortunately I couldn't say more without giving it away - some people may not have seen it.     The blu-ray also contains more special features than you will be able to find on the internet, so it's definitely worth the money. Overall, this is a brilliant musical, referred to as a tragi-comedy (you'll see why), it is laugh out loud funny, and for an independent production, it is about as high quality as they come (despite some saying that their independent budget was noticeable). If you are someone who likes comedy, good music, musicals, Joss Whedon, NPH, or Nathan Fillion, or Felicia Day, there is no excuse for you not to buy this blu-ray. Even if you don't own a blu-ray player or a PS3, you still need to buy this.
0061537969|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The idea of a story being told through the perspective of Enzo the dog was such a refreshing and unique approach.     The story is extremely interesting. It is about a dog going through his life on the eve of his death. He tells the tale starting from where Denny (Enzo's owner and also a race car driver) picks him up as a puppy, through to Denny's marriage, the birth of his daughter and the entire journey of the family post that.    It picks up about mid-way through and post that, I couldn't put it down. You begin to truly empathize with the characters - namely, Enzo, Denny, Joy (Denny's wife) and Zoe (Denny's daughter). Enzo tells the tale through his eyes and adds his own perspective/reading of what goes on in Denny's life. Enzo is able to provide emotional support to Denny, his wife Joy and his daughter Zoe. Also, Enzo has quite the sense of humour! Loved that side of him. Denny's character is another one that I find admirable. His strength, determination and resolve to power through the worst of situations is inspiring.     Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, inspiring and engaging story. One of the best books I have read in a long time.
B00003CXRM|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Thou? starring George Clooney, Tohn Turtubro, Tim Blake Nelson and John Goodman with Holley Hunter, is an unusual, twist of lemon, kind of off kilter comedy that when a loaned copy was not return, I had my wife buy another one for us to view throughout the year as a repeat movie.   For us, it ranks with \\"My Cousin Vinny.\\"    George Clooney's fixation with his hair and his claim to being a \\"Dapper Dan\\" man, and the crack-up line, repeated \\"We thought you was a TOAD!\\"  the FUN music, makes it a HIT FLICK! It includes bazaar things like when the three escaped chain-gang prisoners are unaware that they have become over night recording stars, and Clooney, finding his three little girls, is shocked to hear that his wife told them \\"Daddy was run over by a train,\\" and has found a new boyfriend who is \\"bonified,\\" suggesting their \\"now alive Daddy\\" is not!, fires Clooney with renewed zeal to re-capture the love of his wife and have his family back together once again. Clooney's character convinces the other two prisoners all chained together, (which forces them all to escape together on Clooney's lead) - that he is going to retrieve a lost treasure.        If you have kids, they will laugh along with you throughout this movie.  The characters, the baptisms in the river, the eating of gophers over a camp fire, and Clooney's constant obsession with \\"My hair!\\" just makes for a really FUN movie.  So much so, that after just writing this I'm tempted to watch it again this weekend!   A clean, but really unusual, very funny movie!  It provides quaint lines in the script, that, if you are anything like my wife and I, you will find yourself tossing out to each other or other family members at those \\"perfect moments in life when comedy is in order\\"  (I thought you was a Toad! for instance!)  No X-rated scenes or profanity!  Imagine that!
B003KTMW9K|4.0|I received this product in less than half the estimated delivery time was. You can imagine my my surprise on that one. The game is everything it says and more. I also bought the collector's edition of The Witcher 2 so I won't have to wait to continue Geralt's adventure's. thanks for everything Amazon.
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|This book had great promise and did not live up to that promise. She showed no growth and never explaned why she never just walked away from her kidnapper. Also she never said what happended to the couple who kidnapped her.
0375703861|1.0|I did not like this book one bit. I am amazed at the awards and critical acclaim it has received. Alright, it is a tremendous achievement for Zadie Smith to have written a novel at the young age of 24. However, that does not necessarily mean it is an interesting, engaging or fun read.    As a principle, I like to finish every book I begin to read. I did finish this one too, but trust me, it was a struggle! I have lost count of how many times I fell asleep trying to get through it!!    So what are the issues I had with this book? Firstly, the author attempts to cover a range of diverse topics (immigrants living in the UK, lifestyles of the middle-class society, Islamic fundamentalists, genetic experimentation, etc.). By trying to cover off such a vast amount of subject matter, there is no focus for the reader and the story lacks continuity. Secondly, the characters are pathetic! At the end of it, you feel no affection or empathy for the two protagonists - Archie Jones or Samad Iqbal. Archie is a boring, uninspired individual who is unable to make any important decisions and goes through life with a 'laissez-faire' approach. He makes no effort to carve his own path for his life. Arche's closest friend Samad Iqbal is a man that is stuck in his so-called glorious past. He struggles to find a balance between his Bangladeshi cultural heritage and his life in Britain. He is forceful with this viewpoint and fails to understand others' perspectives. Finally, the overall story was quite pointless! There is a huge amount of time spent on the two friends - who frankly speaking, are not interesting to read about in the least. Other characters such as their wives or their children could have been developed further, leading to a more engaging story line.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Let me just start by saying this, Emily Rose is incredibly attractive. She might be one of the prettiest leads on television. Vanities aside she is a good actress that I had never seen before so I was pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Lucas Bryant and Emily Rose was a bit stiff at the beginning of the series but to me somewhere around the fourth or fifth episode they seemed to figure each other out and that part of the show clicked from there to the end of the season.<br /><br />The series as a whole seemed a little scattered for the first three episodes but loosely borrowing an idea from Stephen King for a story arc is not a bad way to go, I think that idea was what kept me watching the show. The rest of the season is dynamite and there isn't a lot of lag the rest of the season. These aren't really criticisms because most shows have breaking in period where it's a little tough to watch, but the advantage that this series had was that it was on Syfy and not one of the four larger networks so it gave them an opportunity hit their stride and really put something thrilling, mysterious, and dynamic together. This show is what made me start watching Syfy because my friend told me about this show and I decided to take her advice and I bought the first season and I am hooked. There's a lot here to enjoy.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is quirky and fun even Duke Crocker, I know some people tend not to like Eric Balfour, but I personally don't see any reason to dislike the guy. He is the comedic relief by being snarky and somewhat of a schmuck. The chief is about what you'd expect from an old school cop. The two older brothers are interesting and funny at times with their bickering.<br /><br />Some of the plots are as ridiculous as they sound, but somehow they manage to pull it off, don't ask me how but they do. These episodes are few but even with the extravagant reaching they do you're never really bored. The main story arc is something that shouldn't be ruined so just do yourself a favor and buy \\"Haven\\" season 1 and let it grow on you I'm sure you'll be hooked just like everyone else.favor and buy \\"Haven\\" season 1 and let it grow on you I'm sure you'll be hooked just like everyone else.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I liked the new skins. I liked that they added a return button when texting. But I had to uninstall and install the old version of SwiftKey. Why?   The word prediction didn't work at all when using my phone's SEARCH function. That's the main way I surf the web: Press my magnifying glass button on my EVO and fire away. Really disappointed. Dealbreaker. Oh, well, back to the old version.
B0055OK2T0|2.0|I am very surprised by the positive reviews.  The movie was forgettable.  There was nothing \\"deep\\" about the concept.  There was no reason to care about the two main characters which made it difficult to accept the plot.  Their interaction was too silly and unbelievable.  The only good thing about the movie was the cool hats.  Seriously, that's really it.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This book is like a mini-course in Self-Publishing.  Clear, concise, informative, it's a must read for indie authors and those who are wondering about self-publishing.  I enjoyed the background material of 'Why' you should self-publish.  The 'How' part had information that was totally new to me, and I know I'll be referring to it often.  There are also thirty-three indie author interviews, some of who only started in the past few months.  It's interesting reading what others are doing in the field, from the beginners to those who have made a name for themselves.  I've purchased several books on self-publishing, and this one is now on the top of my list as a reference.      Mr. Gaughan has become an authority on self-publishing and his book reflects his research.  Easy to read and understand, he writes about the subject in an orderly interesting fashion.  I was given a copy to read and review, and I'm thrilled I did.  I learned a great deal, even though I've been seriously studying this subject since the first of the year.  I'll be promoting this book to all my writer friends who are considering self-publishing.      Seriously, this book is a must read, even if you are already self-published.
0062009540|5.0|I bought this book because I've been watching the seres on tv. I came in on last 1/2 of season 1 and was a little lost.  This book helped clarify and it was a fast reader because it was so good.  It keeps your attention the whole way through the book.  Definate MUST BUY!!!!
B005529BDK|3.0|this is your typical puzzle popper / match game. it's fun for a little while but I found nothing about it that would make it stand out from the crowd.
B002I9Z8B2|3.0|The movie itself, if you didn't already know, is far and away the best Trek film they ever made. Nuff said.    The blu ray is a mixed bag. Certain scenes are incredibly crisp and clear - you couldn't ask for much more from a 30 year old film. Other scenes are actually blurry. I think this has to do with how the film was originally shot. Where it is most noticeable are scenes with Ricardo Montalban or Shatner. They seem almost out of focus. This is evident in certain background elements in these shots as well. I read somewhere that certain actors were shot in very soft focus to mask their age. If this is so it's pretty ridiculous. Esp when you cut between Shatner (blurry) and Nimoy or Kelly (very clear).  So there's a good chance the picture flaws have nothing to do with the transfer, and everything to do with the egos of a few aging actors.    The sound is not so great. Sound effects are booming and fill the room impressively, but dialogue can easily get lost, even with DAC cranked up. Some dialogue sounds clipped, and others (esp, again, Shatner) are mumbly and unclear.     Although I point out the flaws, this is still a very serviceable print of a great film. If you can pick it up on the cheap like I did, it is a definite upgrade over the DVD version.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Droid original.  I had a lot of fun with this title.  High production value and good game play balance.  Would love to see a sequel.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I gave \\"Band of Brothers\\" five stars because it was a little easier to follow. This film lacks a good lead in that introduces you adequately to the characters.  It does however express the dismal conditions our solderes survived.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I wasn't sure how big a difference the &quot;cloud personalization&quot; would make so i tried it and Wow! It completely customizes to my typing style w/out me adding to a dictionary. It can pretty much predict an entire sentence or phrase u use often.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|If you get this app give it a few days of use before making up your mind. At first I was frustrated with it's suggestions automatically popping into my text. I would have random sentences starting with 'I' like \\"I Let's meet at 7\\".<br /><br />This program has two modes. One is for rapid typists, which will automatically insert text when you type, and the other was for careful typists, that is much more reserved when it comes to automatically inserting a word. After switching to the careful typist mode, this app really shined for me. Everyone should try out both settings to find what is best for them.<br /><br />The auto correction appears smarter than the standard keyboard. The suggestions also tend to work better. My guess for this is unlike the standard keyboard, this app can read your texts, facebook, emails, etc to find out what words you typically use after other words, which it uses to accurately predict what word you will most likely type. This actually made me ROFL when it suggested my girlfriend named 'Marie' for after I typed \\"I love you\\".<br /><br />The only thing I am hesitant on are the permissions. Yes, this app can read texts and emails (if you allow it to within the app's features). And yes, this app needs interest access to download the language you type in. The two combined could be a major security threat, esp. if bank account or credit card numbers are involved. However, this app's privacy policy (I think) states that the data collected from typing is not transferred to their servers. It would put me more at ease if they made this more clear.<br /><br />Overall, I am glad I got this app. It has made typing text more fun and faster on my Droid X.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|i thought this keyboard was great till i tried to use my slide out keyboard and everything was working but then i tried to enter numbers and the alt lock button wouldnt work and i type numbers a lot so if you have a droid 2 and still want to use the slide out then dont download till they update with a fix hopefully it comes soon because i really liked this keyboard
B005D9MUWY|5.0|title says it all.. My personal favorite! Got it for free via Amazon App Store and am soooo happy! I recommend this one for every geek out there.
0345529057|5.0|Shipping, faster then posted, pleased and unexpected when received them.<br /><br />Book set was as described, new condition.<br /><br />This was a birthday gift for mother, so she was pleased when they arrived.<br /><br />Recommends seller!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This is a wonderful blend of two bands that sounds fantastic.  When I first heard it, I thought of the Allman Brothers with Bonnie Raitt on vocals, that is how powerful this band is.  Great sound, great vocals and awesome band!  Highly recommend if you like blues.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|UNBELIEVABLE MOVIE AND STORY PLOT. ONE OF THE FEW MOVIES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT I CAN WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN AND STILL SIT ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT AND BELIEVE IT COULD HAPPEN TO US. EXCELLENT STORY PLOT AND FANTASTIC MOVIE. THE BEGINNING OF THE END COMPARES TO WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE TODAY, RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES AND WE DO NOT CHOOSE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS GOING ON: RAINING DEAD BIRDS, MILLIONS OF DEAD FISH WASH UP ON BOTH EAST AND WEST SHORELINES, LARGE PODS OF SPERM WHALES CHUGGING PAST, TSUNAMI AND MASSIVE EARTHQUAKES HAPPENING IN CHILLI AND JAPAN; SHIFTING OF THE EARTH'S AXIS HAPPENING LITTLE BY LITTLE, ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE, YOU SHOULD WATCH IT AND CONSIDER WHAT WE MIGHT DO TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.  VERY BELIEVABLE.  MAKES YOU THINK AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING, EVEN IF IT IS JUST TO HUG YOUR KIDS AND TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This  movie was so cute I watched it over n over again. Go a headed n buy it u will think the same thing. I would rather put the age limit up to at least 16. Awesome movie! This is my new signature movie for the year.
B00407PNWO|5.0|LOVE! LOVE! LOVE this movie and was so excited that it was available on AMAZON!  It is an excellent story of Robin Hood, as opposed to all the newer versions, with lots of swashbuckling action and a damsel, not in distress but holding her own.  And what can I say ... Errol Flynn is just suave and debonaire and looks great in tights!!
0316056863|5.0|I am a fan of Tina and loved  \\"hanging out\\" with her while I read her book.  It was like having lunch with an outspoken naughty friend.  I think the overall theme of her book was pro women.  She talked about how female comedians were treated differently in many aspects of their careers and how looks and f---ability mattered.  Even the part about Sarah Palin and Hillary underscored how women were treated when it came to politics and taking hard knocks.  I really saw it as a modern day commentary on women's roles and how they were treated in modern society.  I loved how Tina didn't take any s---.  Wish I could hang out with Tina some more.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard app I have seen.  The predictions are pretty good at trying to spell out what you want to say. The new blue neon color scheme is really nice. Putting in email addresses was a bit tricky because of the predictions.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Couple of great points on this product. Comes with everything you need to install it on various different sockets. I installed on my new 1155 socket. It gives a bracket to add a second fan so you can have a push pull setup. Fan that is included seems of pretty good quality, not too loud but moves air well.     My 2600k was running very hot with stock cooler from intel, and would actually hit 90+C while trying to turbo boost so I was scared to do much with it. This cooler with the added second fan keeps it running in the 50's even when overclocked to 4.4GHz. Very happy with this setup. For the money this is hard to beat and really unless you want to go water its hard to beat. This is an ideal heatsink and fan for your new processor.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|CREEPY AS HELL!!!!! Best horror film I have seen in a LONG time. The movie gave me the creeps and my first viewing of the DVD was in the afternoon!! It's good to see a movie come out with all of the creepiness and none of the gore. I rank it up there with The Sixth Sense and Ghost Story. I honestly wasn't expecting much with a PG13 rating, but I was very pleased---loved all of the spooks popping up here and there. A must-see that is destined to be a classic!!!!
B0057AOS3I|1.0|Normally, I like a lot of Beyonce's tracks, but this album is garbage.  I think I MAY like 1 or 2 songs on the entire album/CD.  I am not going to just love her joints because it's Beyonce, and jump on anything she puts out there.  In my opinion, don't waste your money on the whole thing.  Just pay for the songs you like individually.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|So far my user experience with the application is its predictability is both a blessing and the downside to the application.   While it can predict well the application purposely tries to correct things if you are trying to put together a sentence that it may not be used to seeing.   The only other thing I've run into is i've had the program crash multiple times throwing com.  error messages.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|This is spectacular music-making. The two cellists, Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser, have created pieces that are easily equal to and often better than most of the showpieces of the past. This is music of my time, and I am grateful that it exists.
