B00005JNS0|5.0|Never have I been so captivated by an animated film before in my life!  I cannot find enough adjectives to tell you how pleased I was with this film.  It is not only entertaining but life-like with an excellent example of the meaning of friendship for the children. I would recommend this product to all mothers and fathers---it is GREAT!
B000GB775E|3.0|Lindsay Lohan plays Ashley, luckiest career girl. She can do anything successfully with her good luck, but one day she accidentally trades her fortune with Jake (Chris Pine) the unluckiest guy in the city. Jake, wannabe rock band manager (for McFly as themselves) is given a big chance while Ashley loses everything. The story of `Just My Luck' is so simple and silly, and like `Freaky Friday' you don't have to take it seriously. <br /> <br />Now let's forget about the gossips and tabloids for a while, and look at the film's premise itself. Here's a working girl who can achieve anything, and anything here includes her own office. She then loses this supernatural power and tries to retrieve it with the silliest antics I ever saw these days. Yes, I know, as I wrote before, I should take the film as it is, a romantic comedy made for fun, but while watching it I was thinking about one thing. <br /> <br />What does Ashley really want to do? We are not sure from the beginning to the end. Ashley's two female friends or bossy supervisor are not definitely her goal. We find it hard to identify with anyone in the film and with Lindsay Lohan's limited acting range the film relies on easy sight gags that look out of place in this romantic comedy. <br /> <br />It is a pity because Chris Pine is surprisingly good and there is certainly considerable chemistry between the two leads. However, the film's contrived script goes too far when it shows a successful career girl in Sarah Jessica Parker's dress kissing a total stranger with a Zorro-like mask. I don't know the target audiences of the film (and I am not one of them, I know), but if you are among them, you would not confuse luck with stupidity. <br /> <br />One good thing about `Just My Luck' is its rock band McFly. The film is not bad as critics are saying, but it is still not good and the most regrettable thing is my favorite Missi Pyle is wasted again.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The movie seems to have crept into and out of theatres in a whisper but don't be quick to jump to conclusions, The Illusionist is entirely entertaining and so beautiful.  Another great one for Edward Norton, and also Paul Giamatti.  The more you read reviews, the more you will rob yourself from a clever story and the special effects that are so fresh they are destined to make you smile.

I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there. You understand?\\"--Michael Corleone, Godfather Part II<br /><br />\\"The LORD God therefore banished him from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he had been taken. When he expelled the man, he settled him east of the garden of Eden; and he stationed the cherubim and the fiery revolving sword, to guard the way to the tree of life.\\"--Genesis 3:23-24<br /><br />\\"I have no regrets! Everything I went through makes me stronger/the person I am today.\\"--In almost every girl's MySpace profile (with some variations)<br /><br />What things in our past have helped us grow? What have hurt us? Would we be better off without some events of the past? Or, is everything that has happened part of some bigger plan for our lives?<br /><br />Questions and issues such as these were raised in the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, starring Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey plays Joel, a heartbroken man who visits his girlfriend Clementine at the bookstore she works at only to find out that she either does not know who he is or is pretending as if to not know. Joel finds out that Clementine went to a special doctor who erased her mind of any memories of Joel so that she could get a fresh start and move past their tumultuous relationship as if it never existed. Joel, in hasty frustration, decided to undergo the same mind erasing, collecting all items he has that are associated with Clementine in order to undergo the deep mind cleansing sleep. But, once in the mind erasing sleep, Joel realizes how much he loves Clementine and tries to hold onto memories of her before he wakes up and she is gone.<br /><br />The first natural reaction to the decisions of Joel and Clementine is the naïve teenage girl reaction. We can say, \\"no way would I erase my memory. I have no regrets! Everything that happened has made me the person I am.\\" That is a shallow surface level reaction, though. We all have hurts. It does no good to sugarcoat them or play as if all the bad things really help. \\"What doesn't kill me makes me stronger\\" is a false clich&eacute;. Looking at our world of drug addicts and suicides, it is pretty obvious that, though some people come out stronger from trying ordeals, many are broken by their sad circumstances.<br /><br />I have some things in my past that I cannot just look at and say, \\"it is good that that happened.\\" I have had people who have hurt me, where I cannot really say, \\"I am glad that happened; it is a learning experience.\\" There are some things where I just have to say, \\"there is no reason for that to have happened. Nothing can justify it. There is nothing to gain from this or learn from that.\\"<br /><br />There is also another dangerous view to take. It is to take the view that Joel and Clementine made the right decision to erase unhappy memories. This comes from the Cartesian viewpoint that has largely shaped the modern worldview since Descartes wrote in the 17th century, \\"I think, therefore I am.\\" Based on observations of crazy people who saw things that were not really there, Descartes made the claim that there is really no way to know if the reality we see and perceive is really the way things are. After all, crazy people do not know that they are crazy. How is each of us to know that we are not really crazy, and we are not really seeing a skewed view of the world? Descartes says that each person can know for certain that he exists, since if you are doing the thinking, you must exist. But, beyond that, we cannot be certain of anything. \\"I think, therefore I am\\" means that I know I must exist since I am doing the thinking, but beyond that, I have no real way of knowing that anything else I think is real is really real.<br /><br />Slogans such as \\"perception is reality\\" descend from this Cartesian worldview. What one thinks is real is real for that person. A person's \\"reality\\" is what he perceives. A person's past is what he remembers. Each person has his own reality, separate from all other persons. Obviously, we cannot use time machines to literally change our pasts, but, according to a Cartesian, changing memories is essentially the same thing. If our perception is our reality, why not change things so that we can be happier?<br /><br />The problem with this idea is that, like the teenage girl with the no regrets view, it is also naïve. Yes, we each perceive reality a little different. But, we perceive reality differently because there really is a reality to perceive. Most of us see things, though a little differently, almost the same. The few crazy people who really see things differently are an exception. There is an old saying that goes, \\"The exception proves the rule.\\" When we notice that crazy people see things weirdly, it is because we know that there is a right way to see things, and thankfully, most of us see things rightly most of the time.<br /><br />Changing our memories, erasing our memories, though we all, if we are not naïve, wish we could do sometimes, does not really change our pasts. It is an escape mechanism that we use so we don't have to deal with the past. As humans, our task is to deal with, and confront the things that happen to us. The \\"I have no regrets\\" viewpoint and the \\"let's change our memories since perception is reality\\" viewpoint both avoid actually dealing with our problems. It is not healthy to cut ourselves off from those who hurt us, like Michael Corleone does to his brother Fredo in the Godfather Part II. We also can't go back to the way things were before bad things happened. This is why God would not let Adam and Eve back into the Garden of Eden.<br /><br />The late classical/early medieval philosopher Boethius, in his Consolation on Philosophy, said that all fortune is good fortune, and, in particular, bad fortune is better than good fortune, because we can learn from it. That is, everything that happens to us, whether good or bad, is good, because we can learn from it. And, the bad things are \\"better\\", because we learn more from bad things. I am not so sure I entirely agree, but Boethius is right that we cannot ignore the things that happen. Like Jim Carrey's character Joel in his dream, he realizes that we cannot just grudgingly accept the past or ignore the past, but we must confront it.<br /><br />Did Joel and Clementine get back together?

0525457585|5.0|When a young boy named Bastian \\"borrows\\" a book from a shop, he has no idea that he is about to embark on a journey of his own. The book speaks of a place called Fantasia (or Fantastica, depending on the translation) that is built upon the dreams and fantasies of humans. Sadly, Fantasia is crumbling and its Childlike Empress is dying. Because people are not using their imaginations as much as they once were, everything is being overcome by The Nothing, a force which is sweeping the land at an alarming rate. The Nothing's evil henchman is a frightening wolf named Gmork. It is up to Atreyu, a warrior, to stop the spread of the Nothing.<br /><br />There are no words to describe this story, and there are a million words to describe this story. There are a million stories in this book, and there is just one story. I read this book as a young child, and my love for it has never dimished. I keep my copy in pristine condition. If you clapped for Tinker Bell in Peter Pan but you haven't read this book, you must read it now, because you know what it is to imagine and to believe.
B000HT3P7E|4.0|Many people dread Mondays. It is the day you have to go begin getting up early again and go back to work, with a full five days ahead until relief. I don't really have much problem with Mondays. It's Sundays that I don't like (other than, of course it being the LORD's Day. That part of Sunday is always good. Keep the lightning bolts at bay, Yahweh!) On Sunday, you realize the weekend is almost over. What was supposed to be a relaxing, refreshing break from work almost never is. There is always something (family get-togethers, extended visits to watering holes) that does a double energy take-away. (1) You lose energy from being out and not getting sleep and rest. (2) You lose energy realizing that all the work you were planning on getting done for work Monday morning has not even been started and will not get done.<br /><br />Mondays are a cake-walk compared to Sundays. The work that had weighed on my mind on Sunday, I know on Monday is not that big of a deal. Happy Hour exists for Mondays just as much as Fridays, with the same beer specials and half priced appetizers that can be found at the end of the week. Best of all is the Monday T.V. programming on CBS.<br /><br />My three shows are How I Met Your Mother, The Class, and Two and A Half Men. How I Met Your Mother gets brownie points before seeing a single episode just for casting Bob Saget (who plays the effeminate Danny Tanner on Full House) and Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser from Doogie Howser and Neil Patrick Harris/Doogie Howser from Harold and Kumar go to White Castle). The premise of the show: Older Ted who we never see (voiced by Bob Saget), in the year 2030, is telling his teenage children the story of how he met their mother. The episodes consist of the Ted from 2006 and his buddies living as young mid to upper 20 something's figuring out their place in life. Presumably, the duration of the series will lead us to seeing who ends up being the woman that Ted settles down with.<br /><br />Our cast includes Ted, his best friend Marshall, Marshall's fianc&eacute;e Lily (played by Alyson Hannigan, who played Band Camp Girl Michelle in the American Pie movies), Ted's best female friend and Lily's best friend Robin, and, in my opinion, the star of the show, Ted's other best friend Barney (played by Mr. Doogie Howser himself, NPH). Marshall and Lily are the typical happy, in love couple, but they are really cool about it. They always hang out with their friends, and are not That PDA Couple who makes everyone else feel awkward and uncomfortable. Barney is the shameless rich playboy who has no qualms about being who he is, and makes the show always funny and entertaining. Robin is a local television anchor, really pretty, and really sweet. She is the perfect girl. Ted has had girlfriends, but just cannot seem to find the right relationship or the right girl. And, of course, Ted and Robin like each other as more than friends, everyone else can tell, but they will not tell each other. And, yeah, Ted does not know Robin likes him and Robin does not know Ted likes her.<br /><br />The story arc thus far has gone something like this: Marshall and Lily are working out living together and planning the wedding, but more important, serving as friends for Ted and Robin. Barney is the comic relief, and always keeps everyone loose. Near the beginning of the season, there is a wedding they all are attending. Barney goes alone (fear not! He never has to go home alone). Marshall and Lily go together. Ted does not have a date, so he asks Robin. At the last minute, she cancels because of a big opportunity to anchor the local news. So, Ted goes alone, where he meets a really great girl. Robin changes her mind, but shows up just in time to see that Ted has met a girl. A few episodes go by, and the new girl is in Germany, but still dating Ted. Ted is waiting for her to call but she hasn't yet, and he gets a call at 2 AM from Robin, who is sitting around, heartbroken, lonely, and she invited Ted over. \\"Nothing good ever happens after 2 AM\\" runs through his head, but he goes anyway. Ted finds out on the phone from Marshall and Lily that Robin really likes him, so he should not go over, but he does anyway. He tells Robin that he and his girlfriend broke up. They start making out, Ted feels guilty, so he goes to the bathroom to call his girlfriend and officially break up before doing anything with Robin, but he has taken Robin's phone by mistake. Robin answers Ted's phone, and gives Ted the phone with his girlfriend on it...<br /><br />Anyway, the question is up in the air whether Robin is going to be The One, or if the story is leading elsewhere. The show may seem chick flick-ish, but it resonates. We all have friends like Marshall and Lily, the happy couple. We also have friends like Barney, the guy who sleeps around a little too much, and is not afraid to brag about it, but is really a good guy who cares about his friends (even if that concern sometimes consists of \\"I need to get you laid so you can forget that one who got away\\").<br /><br />Wait a second! If you think about the show's premise, it is kind of creepy that Ted is telling his teenage children about his whole pre-meeting their mom sex life. There are some things people should just not tell their children. Oh well. It's just a show.Ted over. \\"Nothing good ever happens after 2 AM\\" runs through his head, but he goes anyway.

0525476881|4.0|An Abundance of Katherines is about many things: Heartbreak. Friends. Family. Math. Most importantly, it is about a young man who takes a road trip to find himself. The literal journey works well for the metaphorical one, of course, and is a familiar storytelling device. Author John Green has made it his own - or rather, Colin's own.<br /><br />Colin Singleton used to be a prodigy. Used to be, because now he's a recent high school graduate, and what means \\"gifted prodigy\\" at age 2 means simply \\"smart\\" at age 18. Not only that, but his girlfriend Katherine just dumped him. In his lifetime, Colin has dated 19 girls named Katherine - never Kathy, never Catherine, always Katherine - and been dumped by every single one.<br /><br />Stuck in that between-time, between boy and man, between high school and college, and positively heartbroken, he goes on a road trip with his best (and only) friend, the blunt and unabashed Hassan. They end up in Carver County, Tennessee, in a little place called Gutshot. There, they meet a kind girl named Lindsey Lee Wells, and her mother, who opens her home to the two boys.<br /><br />Colin wants to have a Eureka moment, to make an amazing discovery. He also wants something more personal: to matter. When he vocalizes this, things change for him. He changes. This means that when his Eureka moment does occur, it signifies something other than what he predicted. And that's a good thing.<br /><br />The same can be said for this book. The book jacket summary and title may make readers initially assume that the story will detail each of Colin's relationships in turn. Instead, they are anecdotes that he shares, stories that he tells, memories that he has. They don't fuel the story; they fuel the character. In other words, this book moves beyond what readers expect to find, and impresses them and surprises them in new ways.<br /><br />This is not unlike Lindsey Lee, the girl in Gutshot, the self-proclaimed chameleon who changes how she sounds and how she acts depending on who she is talking to at the time. She never wants to leave her small town, yet she seems more worldly than Colin. She acts tough and thinks she's the opposite of Colin, but the characters learn that they have more in common than either of them could have imagined.<br /><br />Fans of John Green's Printz Award-winning novel Looking for Alaska will not be disappointed by his sophomore effort. Though the stories themselves are vastly different, with Abundance being much lighter in tone than Alaska, both novels boast intelligent writing and memorable characters.<br /><br />An Abundance of Katherines is more than heartache and theorems. Colin asks if love is graphable, and he finds out that life is unpredictable. What really matters? How can a person matter? Whether or not your name is Katherine, pick up this book, and Colin will share his discoveries with you.ds and how she acts depending on who she is talking to at the time.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|This is a great idea -- having George Martin and his son mash up and remix Beatles tunes from the original tracks, and for the most part it works.  The song selection is superb (I enjoyed some of the lesser-known tracks, like Blue Jay Way and clips from Within You Without You), the vocals untethered are a treat -- Ringo's isolated vocal on Octopus' Garden, the backing vocals only from Lady Madonna -- and the entire experience will put a smile on your face.<br /><br />But don't expect Revolution No. 10.  What this mostly consists of are slight tweaks, a few mild mixups (acoustic intro to Mother Nature's Son bleeds into acoustic intro to Yesterday), and pleasant variations on the melodies we all know and love.  The crisp sonic clarity is remarkable -- I've already blown significant sums on the Capital Volumes remasters, but the sound is so good here it looks like at least one more go-around is in order.<br /><br />The entire project reminds me of what Todd Rundgren did with his No World Order release back in 1991 -- a truly revolutionary record that allowed the user to mash up, slow down, isolate, and remix the entire album in four-second chunks via an Apple device that sadly is no longer on the market.  At the time of its release, Todd had the record remixed by four different top-flight producers, including Bob Clearmountain and others.  The results were fantastic.<br /><br />Now that Capital has unlocked the Beatles genetic code, I hope they follow  this example and let some other producers or artists tinker with the knobs a bit.  I'd love to hear Todd, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, Stevie Wonder or Roger Waters remix the Beatles catalogue, and this project could evolve into a very creative and inspiring series.<br /><br />I'm ready for Love, Volume 2!

Lots of great information here, very interesting. I highly recommend - everyone will learn something. The anecdotal stuff from the millionaire interviews is very interesting/entertaining - probably my favorite parts of the book: from one millionaire: \\"I only drink two kinds of beer: free and Budweiser\\"<br /><br />Most popular vehicle American millionaires own? Ford F150 - that's right. You should read this book.<br /><br />In the spirit of the book, though, shouldn't you pick this up at the library? The millionaires in the book would. Read it and see why. My grandfather would have summed this up with \\"it's not what you make, it's what you keep\\".

In addition to it having EVERY Calvin & Hobbes cartoon ever done, it also contains lots of commentary from Bill Watterson about doing the cartoon. He offers some great insights about behind the scenes.This is a wonderful gift and I want one too!

B0001HAISG|5.0|My family stumbled onto this film by accident and it has quickly become one of our favorites!  It is the closest adaptation to the actual book with some dialog coming straight from the pages.  But what struck us the most was the sheer beauty of the film.  From the beginning it has very rich colors, wonderful narrative, gorgeous actors and a wonderful storyline. It is Peter Pan as he was supposed to be- filled with beautiful fairies, villianous pirates, curious children, colorful Indians, dangerous mermaids and a raggedy bunch of lost boys.  Some of the fight scenes could be a little intense and some pirates die (briefly) on screen and then there is the enormous CG crocodile that eats Hook at the end.  Both of my daughters enjoyed the film immensely and were not frightened or upset by any scenes.  My husband and I even found ourselves discovering new insights from the film. We went out and bought the movie right away and it is a favorite to watch on trips because it has so much action.  This is a great family film!
0140288503|4.0|A realistic depiction of the chaos and destruction of war.  <br /> <br />I waited several years after seing the movie before picking up the book.  In some ways the movie was better.  Normally it is the other way around, but I suggest that you both watch the movie and read the book to gain a better understanding of the events.   <br /> <br />Having spent a few weeks in Mogadishu, several months before the events depicted in this movie, I am still amazed at the anarchy and disregard for human life.  Paul Howe touches on this a few times in the book when referring to civilians interacting with combatants (i.e. bringing them additional RPG rounds) and the use of human shields.   <br /> <br />This country, over a decade after the events in the book, is still a real life version of \\"Lord of the Flies.\\" Good book, good movie, terrible situation.
B00009ATIX|4.0|To begin with, this movie is not a dramatization of the original novel by Stainslaw Lem, yet it follows the premise quite closely. Dr. Kelvin is a shrink still suffering from depression resulting from his wife's suicide (though this is revealed a bit later) when he is hastily sent packing to a space station orbiting a planet named Solaris on the request of one of the researchers on board the station, who happens to be a personal friend of Dr. Kelvin. However, upon reaching there, he is confronted by a manifestation, heck a malediction of sorts, of his late wife. After his initial refusal to accept her, he embraces what he perceives to be a second chance at a lost love, a second attempt, a \\"do over\\" of sorts. However, all is not well. Inspite of his attachment to his late wife's fascimile, he must acknowledge that she is not real and while he and the fellow inhabitants of the space station prepare for a journey back to earth, they must sanitize against any of the manifestations conjoured up by Solaris which appears to be one single massive life form, or maybe a massive colony of teaming lifeforms able to exert a collective influence.  <br /> <br />Soderbergh put in a good deal of effort into preparing this movie, and the fact that the characters use a gamma generator to creating a disrupting higgs field to dismantle the sub atomic bonding holding together the atoms in the physically tangible manifestations (yep not just imagined as in the Stainslaw Lem creationg, these manifestations are as real as your own flesh and blood), is rather impressive.  <br /> <br />The end however is rather disappointing. I think Soderbergh was compelled to end the movie on a \\"happy note\\" or rather give it a fairy tale ending to provide a cushion on which the audience might land. Thus the 4 star rating. There is some heresy about some additional footage running into almost a good 30 minutes more which might eventually be released, though that remains to be seen. Nevertheless, highly recommended.

0679746323|3.0|Jung Chang makes a serious mistake, namely inserting her own bias too often in this book. Nevertheless, her points are compelling and convincing. Her form gets a one, her substance gets a five. Mao was a vile and foul person, intelligent and even brilliant, and perhaps at one time with genuine concern for people other than himself, but he became sheer evil. This book adds to his infamy.    The votings on these reviews here are the most unnatural and fake aspect of Amazon, with the exception of Harriet Klausner. Watch the votes, watch how 24 hours running there are no votes, and then in an hour or two all the positive (anti-Mao) reviews get negative votes, and all the negative (pro-Mao) reviews get positive votes. When I first looked at this book the top reviewers all gave the book five stars, and had 90% positive votes. Look how that has changed. This customer review section, in many ways, is a metaphor for the PRC view of democracy.

0142004235|4.0|East of Eden by John Steinbeck is a classic. Though its plot might be predictable after understanding reading the bible, its style and character development truly merit its great recognition. Every character and its foil are unique in their own way. Most of these characters are exaggerated, therefore they are unrealistic. It is because of this overstatement and overemphasis of the character's specific detail and idiosyncrasy that truly makes this book special. Overall, this book is a great read if you have time on your hands to slowly analyze it.  <br />As I read East of Eden, I easily spotted many allusions to the book of Genesis for I had already became familiar with the stories of Cain and Abel when I had read the Bible,  thereby enhancing my overall understanding of Steinbeck's allusions. At first, I thought reading the book of Genesis was going to be a hassle, just another book to read; however, it added to my reading comprehension. The book incorporated many references to the story of Cain and Abel, and reading the book of Genesis basically supplied me with enough contexts to understand the essential theme of the book. So, anyone who is planning to read this book should skim over the book of Genesis just for a background and reference.  <br />The plot might be rudimentary, but the ideas are thought provoking. After Samuel reads about the story of Cain and Abel, Lee brings light into the situation, establishing the importance of timshel, which is the ability to change one's fate, and in Cal's situation, to either continue wrongdoing or change for the better. The characters literally incorporate the story of Cain and Abel in their discussion to utilize the story as a reference, because of its recurring nature in humanity. As Lee unveils many aspects of the story of Cain and Abel, he concludes many similarities between the bible and the familial relationships. Therefore, Steinbeck incorporates allusions to the story of Cain and Abel to depict its recurring natureand its importance as a reference.  <br />As reference to the East of Eden, the story of Cain and Abel becomes essential to the understanding of the recurring theme; however, both characters are not similar, and of the two, Abel undertakes the persona of the wanderer. Like Abel, Adam and Aron both resemble the less volatile of their brothers. However, it is they, who are often sent off to places literally, and involved in intricate conflicts. As Adam marries Cathy, who alludes to the devil, and travels, while trying to deal with his sons, who are hostile to each other. Like Adam, Aron is literally sent off to the military and discovers much, but only to die as a result of Cal's lies.   <br />John Steinbeck effectively uses characters to further bring objectivity. In this case, he employs Lee's objective nature to bring in outside information. Lee serves as an objective person, who sheds light to the convoluted and intricate tensions that exist between the characters. His being a Chinese servant further parts him from all the complex tensions. Lee literally talks about the story of Cain and Abel, drawing conclusions to the similar conflicts between the characters, alluding to those of Cain and Abel. He becomes concerned with the ability to change fate, according to timshell, where Cal can actually choose to be good.  <br />So go read it, because these books are rare nowadays!

0618680004|5.0|In this age of religious extremism, where fanantics fail to see the irony in oxymoronic terms such as \\"holy war\\" and \\"jihad\\", and whose acts are spilling innocent blood all over the world, this book should be compulsory reading for them.   <br /> <br />After reading this logical and often witty book, any thinking men and women would agree with Dawkins' assertion against the existence of God, or Allah, or any supreme being, as well as come to the conclusion that religion is at the root of many evils.  Alas, if only the blind \\"faithfuls\\" would open their eyes... <br /> <br />The religious right will doubtlessly condemn and vilify this book and its author.  And their followers will be instructed not to read it.  But I eagerly await any argument -- however irrational and illogical -- they will use to refute Dawkins' arguments contained therein. <br /> <br />This is the best nonfiction book I have read in ages.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is a great flick that grows on one with multiple viewings.  It appeals on several levels: <br /> <br />- Technical virtuosity and animation. Hey, it's Pixar. <br /> <br />- Characters.  Lightning IS a hotshot youngster in for some learning.  The Sheriff is, well, the Sheriff.  Doc Hudson is - or comes to be - sympathetic.  You root for him and for Lightning at the end. <br /> <br />-  Recent history.  How the Interstates eclipsed towns that they passed by.  The romance of old Route 66, \\"the Mother Road.\\"  The hypnotic lure of Western landscapes - as the heroine fleeing from L.A. says, \\"I fell in love.\\" The film is poetry at times. <br /> <br />-  A paean to the Hudson Hornet racecar of the early 1950's.  I remember back then that even street Hudsons were low-slung somethings special.   <br /> <br />-  Just plain fun.  I wish the scene where the cars are boogey-dancing down the street could have gone on and on.  That Sheriff moved so cool.  The two Italians were sweet, too (the tire shop owner is a Fiat 500, by the way, Italy's remarkable postwar little two-cylinder car that went everywhere from the highest Alps to the lowest valleys).    <br /> <br />

B000GIXEIG|1.0|If you have any love for Seamus Heaney's recent translation of the Beowulf epic saga, for action movies or for the core tenets of the western warrior ethic then DON'T watch this movie. It will break your heart at its misrepresentation of its primary source and in its mean spirited attack on the early roots of the Northern European cultures. When \\"Brother Where Art Thou\\" came out the authors claimed that it was based on the Odyssey. That movie was so far removed from anything to do with the Odyssey that you could ignore that piece of post modern conceit and enjoy a uniquely told tale. This movie cannot be ignored for what it is - a deliberate revision of the saga to make traditional heroism and warrior spirit seem lost, confused, helpless and deserving of extinction. <br /> <br />The movie's themes are a complete rejection of the core values and actions of the characters in the saga and the themes that have replaced it are designed to ridicule the traditional heroes and laud the villains of the piece. In this movie Beowulf can be an effective hero but is now \\"confused\\" as to whether he is on the side of \\"right\\" this time. Grendel's violence is only a reaction to violence perpetrated by the Dane King, Hrothgar - so we have the Europeans favorite theme- \\"the cycle of violence\\" as the cause of the genocidal attacks of Grendel on the Danes. And the monster avoids the king and kills his people, so it really is an attack on all, not just the king. Oddly, the king's real error was in showing mercy to Grendel as a child so, as troubling as it seems, the movie supports the traditional European perspective that ethnic cleansing works - leave no survivors or you will pay. (Its nice to see an act of mercy to the child of a poacher result in the deaths of dozens of people who had nothing to do with the problem in the first place. Terrorism is your payment for existing is also a constant EU-like theme these days.)The King is a drunken, cowardly lout who is incompetent and a figureof ridicule, as are all authority figures in the post modern view. The main female character was forced into a life as a prostitute as an orphan but is also harboring the child of Grendel--who raped her but now protects her from those who would \\"cut my throat\\" although the village seems quite happy to have her around--so I am assuming this is because they WOULD kill her if they knew about the child. Earlier in the movie, the Queen offers the female sanctuary within the court but the character replies that \\"We made our choices long ago\\". Like any good movie viewer you think \\"Ah, back story!\\" Yet later we find that the female character has never made a single choice in any of this - raped as a child prostitute and raped and impregnated by Grendel. So that message is blurry to say the least. Grendel is not a troll - our confused and pensive hero asks \\"What is a troll exactly?\\" and in the movie it seems that Grendel, like both his father and his son are just really huge hairy guys who don't speak and look scary enough to be threatening. (The \\"challenged\\" and misunderstood outsider is the victim of mainstream cultural prejudice).Oddly, after Grendel impregnates the female character her hair begins to look as straggled as does Grendel and family--- sort of a bride of Frankenstein or Army of Darkness effect once you have been raped by the monster. Clearly, this element got completely away from the authors of the screen play. Equating prostitution and rape is not a bad idea, it's just interesting coming from a culture that so embraces \\"entertainment worker visas\\" for major sporting events. As for Beowulf--he is brave enough, but inept in fighting the monster and when the struggle finally takes place it is Grendel who cuts off his own arm to escape--and that confrontation only occurs  because Beowulf and his men desecrated Grendel's shrine to his dead father - the cycle of violence thing again. In the end, Grendel does die and Beowulf kills Grendel's mother with his sword.But then he also meets the hidden Grendel child and is basically mocked by the female character that the child will also exact revenge against Beowulf for the death of Grendel. (\\"So, Hrothgar taught you nothing.\\") Beowulf lets the kid and the Mother live. He must be counting on the distance between them because this story makes it clear-- once the revenge cycle has started they will come for you and no act of mercy or soulful looks or lame \\"shrine\\" to the homicidal martyr who just killed himself will keep you from getting your head bashed in. <br /> <br />There has been a GREAT deal of discussion, commentary and disagreement about the topic of the \\"culture war\\" between those who hold a respectful and traditionalist view of the main tenets of western civilization and those who disparage it. Often this issue seems overplayed and certainly serves as a political football. But sometimes you just trip over an example of the \\"revision\\" of a core western virtue or cultural frame of reference which not only denigrates the culture, but distorts it beyond all recognition. So it is with this terrible movie and the cowardly and dishonest cultural perspective that it promotes.( In passing, if you are interested in a masterful telling of this saga from Grendel's point of view, then find Grendel by John Gardner. Now that is the way to reverse a story without destroying its core principles. If you think I am over reacting to the post modern view of this saga, read Honor by James Bowman).

B000J103PC|5.0|Storyline great, yet a little predictable. A little bit cheesy, but fun. The acting in the movie is great, even a little appearance of supermodel Gisele which didnt do so bad with the 2 or 3 lines she had. This movie is not only for fashion lovers but anyone that just wants to see a great movie so watch it and find out for yourselves, definately worth a couple bucks.

B000J3OTSM|3.0|well there is not much to say about this movie...extremely predictable, bad guy steals the heart of the good girl and blah blah. The dancing is good, and so is the acting. The overall story is average, seems to be a forgetable movie that you would only watch once or twice then put on your shelves to collect dust.

B000BYA5G4|4.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" is a genuine cinematic rarity: a mainstream black comedy that doesn't soften its material or compromise its vision to cater to audience sensibilities.  Nicholas Cage plays the world's foremost private small arms dealer, whose key to success lies in the fact that he never chooses sides in any armed conflict, opting instead to be an equal opportunity \\"merchant of death\\" to all.  For Yuri Orlov, peace is the only real enemy, and if innocent people have to die to keep him in clover, well, hell, he didn`t make this world, and there`s no reason why he shouldn`t get his if everybody else is getting theirs.<br /><br />Like a master chef working his way to the heart of an artichoke, writer/director Andrew Niccol peels back the layers of his story to reveal the truths of the international gunrunning trade.  Yuri is a chilling and disturbing character precisely because he is so utterly ordinary and difficult to read.  Niccol does not portray him as evil incarnate, but, rather, as a reasonably well-adapted family man who just happens to be good at what he does and has the requisite capacity for self-rationalization that allows him to do his job and still live with himself.  To his own way of thinking, Yuri is really no different from the man who sells tobacco or automobiles - both products, he explains, that actually result in the deaths of more people than firearms - then goes home to the love and adoration of his wife and kids.  Yuri doesn't sell arms because he had an unhappy childhood or out of any sense of entitlement because he feels the world has treated him badly.  He simply knows that if he weren't doing business with these murderous dictators - or as they like to call themselves \\"freedom fighters\\" - around the world, somebody else would be.<br /><br />Most of the dark humor of the film comes from the detached, flippant and unemotional commentary Yuri provides as the film's narrator.  He is quick to point out the ironies and absurdities inherent in so much of the arms business, and it is only the gruesome seriousness of the consequences that makes us catch our throats as we laugh.  And Niccol certainly makes it clear that Yuri is only small potatoes compared to the governments who put far more weaponry into the hands of thugs and mercenaries than Yuri ever does.  That little detail, snuck into a title card in the final moments, is the ultimate depressing reality Niccol uses to bring down the curtain on his film.  In fact, Niccol bravely refuses to \\"redeem\\" his character at the end.  Yuri loses just about everything and everyone he cares about at the end thanks to his activities, but the world goes on and he's decided he's going to go right on along with it.  And why in the world not?  Selling arms is \\"just what he does.\\"<br /><br />In a very nuanced and balanced performance, Cage conveys just the right note of dispassionate detachment without ever becoming either too callous or too maudlin.  Yuri seems to genuinely like people and obviously loves his parents, his drug addict brother, his wife and his young son.  That only makes his ability to compartmentalize his morality that much more frightening.  Ethan Hawke gives a strong performance as the Javert-like Interpol agent obsessed with bringing Yuri to international justice, and Bridget Moynihan is stoic and sweet as the beautiful young wife who is willing to turn a blind eye to Yuri`s activities for only so long before finally confronting her husband.<br /><br />Funny as well as chilling, \\"Lord of War\\" will give you a whole new terrifying perspective on how the world actually works.ch of the arms business, and it is only the gruesome seriousness of the consequences that makes us catch our throats as we laugh.

B000084T18|3.0|This guy actually believes his own hype. 50 thinks thinks that Soundscan sales equals respect. He said that his first album did what LL Cool J did his whole career. That's insane. Some of the most artistic rap classics never sold millions. LL is really tarnishing his legacy by running behind this dude. 90 percent of 50's success was due to signing with Shady Aftermath at the height of Eminem's fame in 2002. Everyone bought into his underdog bid to take out Ja Rule and Murder Inc in 2003. Had he perfected his flow and taken rap music further in a positive direction, he would still have his fan base. Instead dude proved to be the biggest and worst gimmick in hip hop history by sticking to his formula of Beef & Bullets and biting Murder Inc. He's even dissed Dr. Dre who basically saved dude's life by signing him and Eminem. He's even starting to dis Em. You can YouTube their TRL appearance from December 2006 for proof. <br /> <br />In closing, the only way that Curtis will survive is by killing the 50 Cent character off and becoming a real artist & person. Not by signing up rap legends and dissing.
038073186X|4.0|I recently had the opportunity to meet the author and hear him speak in two panel discussions. I got an autopgraphed copy of Mystic River and bought Gone, Baby, Gone and Shutter Island as an afterthought.<br /><br />Like most of Lehane's work, this is not a happy book populated with happy people.<br /><br />From the beginning, there's a creepy vibe that only gets worse as the story progresses. I was engrossed and couldn't wait to see where Lehane was going with Teddy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat telegraphed and ultimately doesn't live up to the first 4/5 of the novel.<br /><br />I won't discuss details or talk about the story itself so as not to give anything away to potential readers.<br /><br />Overall, a very good book marred by a weak ending.
B000002B35|5.0|Yet, I'll give it a go. I bought the CDs mainly due to the performance of Comfortably Numb (which is absolutely the best guitar solo ever!) but it is so much more than just one song.

B000I5X81K|3.0|I will buy any Josh Groban CD without hearing even one note first, and this album did not change my mind about that.  However, it's probably my least favorite of his albums.  His voice is beautiful, as always, but I found the album a bit bland.  As often happens with CDs, I grew to like it more the more I listened to it, and found some definite favorites in \\"Machine\\" and \\"February Song,\\" but it will never become as special to me as his others.<br /><br />But don't let my lackluster review sway you.  If you love Josh Groban, you'll love this CD.  It's a must have for your collection.

The characters were so developed that I became attached the ending devastated me. I didn't see it coming that way.
B00005JPCA|5.0|Someone on this project found down right fantastic writers.  Thank you for giving them the creative license to make this finally amazing Bond movie. Less were the gadgets and gizmos, and more was the intricate plot and brutish brawler with a (very hidden) gorgeous heart of gold (and gorgeous baby blue eyes, I must say). Impressive that these people went out on such a limb and did the (seemingly) unpopular thing and made a really well rounded, well played action film.

But Tool's Ænima and Lateralus (the cds I own) are musical propositions, with attention even to the art and design of the album's physical package. Tool's albums can be listened as a 1+ hour song. Even the \\"interludes\\" are a welcome addition, for breathing between songs. For me this is Lateralus, a five stars epic song.

032147404X|5.0|A real boon for amateur photographers and those who have photographed for years but without professional training. Each page is a fully illustrated sound-bite of information. You can sample by topic or technical aspect. The author gives plenty of simple/easy tricks that the professionals use along with some  slightly more complex tips. But it is all practical, usable, accessible and, most important, understandable! Some tips you may find you've already been utilizing (that feels good) and many new ones will delight you and put new inspiration into everyday photography!

B00005JNS0|4.0|My whole family loved this movie!  Some of the humor is \\"adult\\", which means it goes over the heads of the younger kids,and it wasn't too bad, but I kinda wish they could have made it interesting to adults, yet without being suggestive. <br />Other than that, I really liked the movie.  The voices were great!
B000H0MKO2|2.0|To be honest, I bought this movie to see more of Katie Holmes' acting since the last I saw of her was in \\"President's Daughter\\", which I did like immensley. I was very disappointed in this movie - not only because it had very few scenes with Katie in them, but because it seemed to \\"wander\\" without a firm ground for plot or for the characters themselves. I lost interest a fourth of the way into the picture and never regained it.

I was surprised when my husband sat down and watched it with me.  I even caught him laughing more than once.  (It was odd because he NEVER watches chic flicks!)  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|More great stuff from the man from Celbridge! I especially love \\"9 Crimes\\", which yet again showcases how well Lisa and Damien sound together. My only qualm is that he really needs to lighten up once in a while - this album can be a bit of a downer. But when you're in the mood for that sort of thing, then DR is the best in the business!
B00006BTCA|4.0|Where do I start? This album took me completely by surprise, I wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, but now, well let's just say it's in steady rotation. What a band! so many influences yet an entirely unique sound. Interpol has crafted an image and sound that weaves in itself so well, that it is often very difficult to separate any aspect of their overall vibe for fear of losing something vital. The raw emotion that Paul Banks emits is so wonderful in an age where most people are so afraid to show their vulnerabilty and weaknesses. The guitar work is inspired and intense. You never forget that this band is guitar based. It also seems to me that there is a lot of band member input into all the songs, the range of harmony and rhythm is quite impressive.<br /><br />Lyrically, there is soo much going on. You can almost feel NYC when you listen to Interpol. It is obvious that they love the east coast very much. This is one of those bands that mystifies you with color and sound, wrapping you up in their experiences and discoveries. This is not music that can be played as background filler, this stuff makes demands of the listener. It challenges you to make your own interpretations, it urges you to wander, to dig inside yourself and find something that lives and breathes. In short, these guys exude life, and they look good doin' it.<br /><br />Very good. Highly recommended!

B00005JKG9|5.0|This is one of those movies that separates the men from the boys. If someone tells you that it sucked...most likely, they know s*^t about film.<br /><br />The composition and structure is entirely sound, the acting is beyond mere traditional concepts of performance, the direction is so focused and unrelenting that you almost feel like you took the real estate exam. A beautiful cameo from Alec Baldwin, depicting the iciness of the industry, shows us why these people are the way they are. There is nothing here that can even be remotely attached to anything before it. It is singularly unique in that respect. We are thrown into these people's lives and are given the dubious honor of watching them fail...miserably! We see pathetic behaviour in movies all the time, but never before have I felt so lonely and isolated (watch Jack Lemmon doing a cold call to a young couple, desperately clinging on to even the most remote sale).<br /><br />This brings us to the film's most mind blowing truth, most of us in life have to settle for something a little less than what we had imagined as children, but these guys are so lost, that they've lost touch with their own humanity. It is compelling, sad, depressing and ultimatley real. We need more film that represents the human condition and how far we stray from that zone in order to maintain some semblance of sanity. In my opinion, one of the greatest films of all time.
B000063DS1|4.0|The Last Waltz is a controversial beast.  As a rock documentary, it's an absolute classic, bringing to life the interviews of a diverse lineup of rock stars and depicting a marvelous one-night-stand concert in a very exciting way.  As an event for The Band, it was a bit of an act--Robertson was the only one who wanted to quit, and the performance was especially forced for drummer Levon Helm, who didn't like the entire concept and found the film to be especially biased to Robertson's ego.  For better or worse, though, here it is on CD in as complete a form as has ever been released (a few tracks are still missing and horns are overdubbed on a few as well, and the tracks aren't in their original order).  The group is certainly not as on top of their game as they once were, since the road and drugs have taken their toll, but they give it their all and the star-studded guest appearances make for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  This boxed set is the only way to experience this concert--it has the music that wasn't in the movie, it has the studio theatrical music, and it has the rehearsals that were (in some cases) better than the actual performances.<br /><br />When the concert is good, it's great.  Van Morrison's \\"Caravan\\" is a transcendent rock and roll moment, and The Band really cuts it up on some of their own material, like Rick Danko's classic \\"Stage Fright\\" vocal and The Band's final, barnstorming encore, \\"Don't Do It.\\"  A lot of great songs are on here that didn't make it to the movie either, like the group affair \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" with Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, and Neil Young's \\"Helpless,\\" which sounds great with The Band's vocalists as backup singers.  The rehearsals are great too, with \\"King Harvest\\" as a highlight (I still don't know why they're withholding the actual live version of this classic).<br /><br />When The Last Waltz is mediocre, though, it's pretty mediocre.  For instance, \\"Out of the Blue.\\"  With three amazing vocalists, Robbie Robertson's egotistical advancement of his own middling voice is pretty disappointing.  A few of the takes are pretty middle of the road too, like the live \\"The Weight,\\" and the rushed \\"W.S. Walcott's Medicine Show.\\"  Neil Diamond, though he performs his song with his usual grace (I admit it, I'm a fan) doesn't really belong with The Band on such an important night.  Sorry Robbie.<br /><br />Overall, The Last Waltz is a solid experience on CD, but it's definitely overshadowed by the truly essential film version of the concert which has great visuals and interview footage (not to mention a lot of close-ups of Robbie, thanks to Marty's infatuation with the guitarist).  As a CD it doesn't capture the visual scope of the night and can't compare to the performing quality of Rock of Ages, the group's first and superior live album.  If you're going to buy The Last Waltz on CD, though, this one has the most music and captures ALL of the best moments, where the other versions are even more heavily-edited and miss out on some of the greatness.otistical advancement of his own middling voice is pretty disappointing.

B000IMV4IW|5.0|I got \\"What's The Story Morning Glory\\" for a variety of reasons. Oasis is one of those groups that bring back the straight rock with the new style. This a GOOD collection of Syd's Floyd to Beatle-like variety of good lyrics and well produced music. Its kind of a British Invasion 90's style, I guess. Anyroad, I like it. You can listen from start to finish and the only questionable thing is \\"Acquiesce\\". Perhaps I should look up the word and I'd appreciate what they did more on that one. Fun stuff!!
1594200823|5.0|I disagree with Erik Marcus' review that claims this book merely tries to make the \\"case for eating animal products.\\"  This is a distinctly limited understanding of the book from someone who seems to only be interested in understanding the book with the socio-political lens provided by vegetarianism.  In reality, The Omnivore's Dilemma is so much more than just a case for eating animal products--as the author puts it on the last page, \\"imagine for a moment if we once again knew . . . these few unremarkable things: What it is we're eating.  Where it came from.  How it found its way to our table.  And what, in a true accounting, it really cost\\" (p. 411).  THIS is the real essence of the book, and it's a series of questions that resonates strongly with me and I think should be important to pretty much anyone who eats food.<br /><br />Throughout his book, Pollan traces the history of four meals: 1) a fast food meal produced by \\"conventional\\" industrial agriculture (most of which is derived from dirt-cheap corn products--so many that it seems almost every processed food comes from corn and the oil it takes to grow it--and factory farmed meat), 2) Industrial organic agriculture (improved farming practices based on the USDA's standards that still operates on a national and sometimes global scale), 3) \\"Beyond organic\\" agriculture, which fuses strict organic ideals with an emphasis on eating locally and seasonally (i.e. no bananas in Alaska in January), and 4) Hunting and gathering locally.<br /><br />The result is a book that is as compelling as it is timely--Pollan's study of industrial agriculture (organic included) raises some important health, environmental, and ethical issues and exposes the dark truths about where conventional food comes from (essentially oil, which makes fertilizer used on corn, which makes up processed food and feeds inhumanely-kept animals [not meant to eat corn] which we eat).  The organic section of the book also raises awareness about the pretty alarming and unnatural practice of shipping food all over the world when it can easily be grown locally.<br /><br />In sum, Pollan's book isn't a direct polemic.  Rather, it's more an encouragement to think about those questions (which a lot of people can't answer--\\"where DID this food come from??\\") and perhaps decide on your own that perhaps food is something that is worth the extra money and effort it takes to ensure that it it is healthy for you, and humane and sustainable for the animals and environment that produces it.  There's so much useful and interesting information in this book I can't begin to scratch the surface in a review--I highly recommend you read it and hope you find it as meaningful and relevant as it's intended to be.etty alarming and unnatural practice of shipping food all over the world when it can easily be grown locally.   <br /> <br />In sum, Pollan's book isn't a direct polemic.

B000002BBY|4.0|You know, I bought a couple of Oasis cd's because people said they were trying to imitate The Beatles. They're wrong. If they are, so are thousands of others. Actually, Oasis has a variety of stuff and its listenable. To me, they're more of a watered down Sex Pistols than anything else. A lot of mellow stuff and Liam Gallagher, the lead vocal, does a good job of rockin' without \\"screamin' bloody mad\\". Noel Gallagher is great with guitarring and writing. Even Gary Glitter is a co-writer of one (I was impressed) and good ol' Alan White was on drums. I wonder if its the same Alan WHite that played drums of \\"Love Me Do\\". The Plastic Ono Band and other post-Beatle gigs. I liked it. Not something I'd play over and over again, but a refreshing change from the electric and heavy metal stuff. Go for it!! The title intrigued me as well.
1580086810|5.0|If you have ever read the Material World by Peter Menzel and loved it than you need to buy this book.  Each page is filled with photos and interesting tidbits about the individuals being showcased.  I have read it over and over, and it's truely a masterpiece.  Definately worth the price.
B00000J7JO|2.0|The music is great but the CD sounds like full of static. I have tried it on several high quality reproduction systems with the same result. I don't know if this is a problem of this particular disc or it is just poor production revealed on a high-end stereo system. If I knew, I would not have spend the money.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|this is a ground breaking documentary.  It has none of the rough edges that usually characterize this genre.  Mr Gore presented this information for a couple of years before making the film, so it's well paced, clearly spoken, and entertaining.  This film should be required viewing.
B000003Z12|5.0|I bought this album many years ago when visiting a hi-fi retailer with a friend who was looking for amps and speakers. This was one of the demo albums. <br />It has always had a treasured position in my collection - THE best guitar instrumental album. And that it is not accolade achieved lightly. I am a great guitar fan and have many albums by other established players such as Lee Ritenour, Larry Carlton, Joe Satriani, John Williams etc and I love them all, wwhatever their musical style. <br />However there is something about Beyond the Thunder that makes it practically the ideal album whatever your mood and I gravitate towards it more often than any other. I recently used several of the tracks to soundtrack a DVD of holiday photos that we took last year and have been inundated with requests for me to tell who is playing. Do I tell them or keep it to myself? There is a certain devious pleasure in being 'in the know' about artists that are not household names. It is sometimes to do with the fact that another person might not like an album as much as you do - that has not been the case with this one. I could not hold back and several friends and family are now slowly coming to terms with this great music. <br />Favourite tracks - Big Moon (the demo track from the shop noted above)Caribbean Blue and Call of the Wild (what a soundscape)
B000J103PC|4.0|I really did not expect to like this movie but I found most of it enjoyable. In both acting and appearance, Meryl Streep was just remarkable. I wish she had been in even more of the scenes but you do see her in most of them. Ann Hathaway was also terrific but I did not care for the casting of her boyfriend.  Somehow he just didn't fit. Can't say the ending is a huge surprise but if you are looking for a just plain fun movie to watch some evening, this is it. This will probably inspire you to check on the web and see who this was maybe, sort of, could have been based on.  You will find the articles interesting!
B0000DIXN7|5.0|I gave this album 5 stars because not only did I really like her voice, the original music was great and she even gives a nod to some old soul music and hip hop, but it's the lyrics that make me want to meet this chick. I loved her sense of humor in the songs and she has a lyrical wit not found in many popular performers today. You've gotta check this one out. <br />
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I am a 45 year old jazz fan, but I really like this album, and I never heard his previous stuff, so I have no preconceptions. There's different styles and modes here but they blend well. Mayer is a terrific guitar player for a 'pop' artist. Hell, Eric Clapton invited him to Crossroads Blues Festival so he can't be bad.  I particularly liked \\"Gravity\\", \\"In Repair\\", and dedicated to my ex wife: \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\". His re-interpretation of Jimmi Hendrix' \\"Bold as Love\\" was good - a tough lyric and tricky rhythm. Didn't like \\"Belief\\" and \\"Vultures\\" too much, but still:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've already watched it twice.  And I love the bonus features...the bootcamp taped by Ron Livingston is great!  You get a bird's eye view of what they really had to go through to prepare for their roles.  Definitely recommend this!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The first season was great, and the second is just as good, if not better!  Good mystery and it ties up some things from season 1.  Can't wait for season 3 to come to DVD.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|If you like ALIAS - this box set is absolutely amazing. The \\"hidden\\" special features disk is awesome and has some really great stuff. If you're looking to get into ALIAS - you'll probably end up buying all the box sets anyway, so why not buy them all together? Overall, no matter who you are, the box set is AMAZING and so is ALIAS.

9707704667|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in 2006, if not the best. It tells the story of a man slaved and abused by a woman - \\"La Niña Mala\\", the bad girl - he keeps loving for his whole life. He's a looser, she's someone who spends her whole life looking for grandeur, richness and pleasure. She comes to, and goes from, his life, always being accepted and always despising and abandoning him. And his life - he, a Peruvian as Vargas Llosa himself - takes place in the rebel Paris of the 60s and in the swinging London of the 70s. He's a man who never had another woman in his life than the \\"bad girl\\" - and that never really had her, who always had him. <br />I have recommended the book to many people; all of them have been thrilled and have compulsively read - and have suffered with the man and loved the book. <br />I have read it in Spanish (as written by Vargas Llosa), but there is an English translation.

0375703861|5.0|Zadie Smith's White Teeth is magnificent, all the more so because it is a debut novel that eerily sets the stage for the September 11 attacks.  But don't let the talk of epic themes scare you away, for White Teeth is absorbing and entertaining.<br /><br />White Teeth is the story of three generations of two English families, one an immigrant family from Pakistan, the second created by the marriage of an English Everyman to the daughtet of a Jamaican immigrant.  Much of the storytelling revolves around the children of the two families, whose members flirt with Islamic fundamentalism, the extremes of scientific rationalism, and environmental activism.<br /><br />Much in the way of Dickens, Smith explores greater societal themes through her characters: racism and integration, Islamic fundamentalism, genetic experimentation, and the conflicts between science and faith.  Also like Dickens, Smith never let her themes overrun a good story-- her characters are absorbing on their own terms, rather than tedious soapboxes for policy polemics.<br /><br />I did have one quibble-- I found the novel's first 50 pages tedious and almost gave up on Smith and White Teeth.  I'm glad that I kept reading-- the first 50 pages merely set the stage, and the action picks up thereafter.<br /><br />Zadie Smith is a magnificent talent.  It is remarkable that a writer in her 20s could produce White Teeth.  But don't take my word for it-- see for yourself.<br /><br />Enjoy this debut novel and celebrate this new writer.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Great movie for a teenager!  Not realistic, so therefore, it's not realistically scary.  Language isn't as bad as most PG or PG-13 movies, and it's ACTION PACKED!
B000JK8OYU|3.0|The Beatles return - or not<br /><br />By Karen Herberman<br /><br />The Bisbee Observer<br /><br />The Beatles were to my generation as Glenn Miller was to that of our parents.' There were a lot of groups that I enjoyed listening to, but the Beatles were far and away my favorite.<br /><br />The first time I heard them was on the radio on a Saturday afternoon countdown show that played the top 40 hits. I remember like it happened yesterday. Some friends wanted to hear the fight that resulted in Cassius Clay - later Muhammad Ali -- beating Sonny Liston to become the World Champion. It was Feb. 25, 1964. I happened upon some music to listen to while waiting for the fight to start. I hadn't paid any attention to popular music for some months and was amazed to find out that all but one of the top 10 hits was by the Beatles. I was immediately smitten and still am.<br /><br />The first time most of America saw them was on The Ed Sullivan's Show. They sang five songs and stunned America. They were mere boys, not yet movement icons. My goodness, they had hair that nearly touched their collars! How shocking! American mothers shuddered in horror. In retrospect, their look seems very conservative. Heck they wore suits and ties!<br /><br />Their first television appearance was on Feb. 9, 1964. They actually appeared three consecutive Sullivan shows that month, although I somehow missed seeing them. Those Sullivan show clips became famous. By March 1964, Beatles music counted for 60 percent of all record sales.<br /><br />This was before the romances and heartbreaks, the flip outs and travels to India to seek enlightenment, drug busts and Yoko, and all the other weirdness that ensued. It was all part of the endearing and convoluted saga that included the group being knighted for their contributions to music and the UK. It didn't end even after the Big Breakup when they disbanded; their music went on and on - now immortal.<br /><br />Who would have thought that their music would become part of the body of what we consider to be standard music in our culture? I even heard their music as background at McDonald's not long ago. Every kid in chorus has sung \\"Yesterday\\" for at least one concert. Their music is recognized by several generations of fans.<br /><br />What brought about my reminiscing about the Beatles is a new release that I recently listened to several times. Even though they haven't made an album together for about 40 years and despite the that fact that two of them are dead, there is a new Beatles album just released in time for the holiday market.<br /><br />\\"Love\\" is the title. When I first listened to it, the word collage came to mind, not a word that is usually applied to music. Not a medley, but layers of various familiar parts of Beatles music. At times it drifts seriously toward cacophony and then, when all seems lost, the pure sweet tune of a much-loved song comes through in its original version, or nearly so. It all seemed a bit odd until I realized that it is the score for a new Las Vegas show. The score was written by Sir George Martin, who produced the originals, and his son, Giles Martin, using master tapes of Beatles original music at their Abbey Road Studio.<br /><br />\\"With LOVE, Cirque du Soleil celebrates the musical legacy of The Beatles,\\" they say. A \\"soundscape,\\" they call it. Maybe this piece of work works best if you see the show.<br /><br />It was endorsed by the remaining members of the group, but got mixed reviews. It was less than Beatles diehard fans were hoping for. I don't suppose it could have been otherwise.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you are interested in seeing the show in Las Vegas, tickets are available from $69 in the upper balcony to $150 in the lower orchestra.

B0000549B0|4.0|Our household (consisting of two forty year-old parents, a fourteen year old girl and a seven year old girl) loves this film.  I think it's because the film does a good job of depicting family relationships (how do explain the odd relative to ousiders?) as well as exploring the issues revolving around the faith and truth of another's experience that is without proof or logic. <br /> <br />This film isn't for everyone.  It's a quiet, rather pedestrian and very sweet film, so if you are looking for a lot of razz-ma-tazz, this film isn't for you.  However, after viewing this film a couple of times, my fourteen year-old asks, \\"Why don't they make films like this anymore?\\" <br /> <br />Josephine Hill and James Stewart are wonderful in this film.

0740748475|5.0|Yeah, I'd like probably rate this as the best-est book every made by man. I mean, like one book of Calvin and Hobbes is already a 5 star book. How about if I took the entire collection of Calvin and Hobbes and compressed into 3 hard cover volumes and nestled those into a decorative box. It would be about 35 stars at least out of 5 ... plus 2 bonus stars for coolness. <br /> <br />Only problem is because of the weight, it's really hard to read while on the  toilet. I'll need to setup a separate reading bracket to help support the weight.
B00004T9UF|4.0|This album is great. If you get offended easily, you might not like this record. This record is partially a response to the big controversy Em had created at the time, and the theatrics of this record actually are what make it appealing. Some of the interludes reflect upon that. It's definitely a personal album, even if other stuff may become more of a focus. He actually does sound like a maniac on parts of the record, like on the track \\"Kim\\" about killing his wife or in some of the still sort of animated lyrics. I actually like the first album more in spite the fact that this album is more mature and reflective. Of course, the hits \\"Stan\\" and \\"The Way I Am\\", and album cuts like \\"Marshall Mathers\\" are other great tracks. \\"Stan\\" is memorable because of the obsessive fan and how he gets angrier in each letter, and then the other tracks talk more about the controversy, and one thing I like about this album is it kind of makes you think for yourself. I think that's the point of a track like \\"Criminal.\\" <br /> <br />Then there is actually a couple of weaker tracks. \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" is okay, but it seems like songs like this are usually the weakest on his records, in spite being the songs to promote his albums. I don't really like the D-12 song, \\"Under the Influence,\\" either.  <br /> <br />Definitely worth a listen. <br /> <br />(You may hate him and such, but this album is one of his winners. And metalheads, just stop reviewing stuff because you think you know it based on people who listen to it. People have good reasons why they stereotype you and your music, too, but it doesn't make it anything more than pointless.)
B000001DTM|5.0|Perhaps I'm just nostalgic, but the first time I heard this album on tape. I stole it from my sister and played it on my tiny cassette player. Despite the crappy audio quality and tiny speakers, this album sounded like it was blasting through my ears. I was taking in every word of Bono's alter ego, Fly over Even Better Than the Real Thing, feeling the subtle blast of the Edge's guitar riffs, and the pounding rhythms of Adam and Larry's percussion on every inch of song.     <br /> <br />This was the day that I loved music. From that day forward, I would listen and obsess over all genres. This is the beginning of my musical journey. This is my white album...
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I don't know what it is that I enjoy so much about \\"Frances the Mute,\\" the second LP by the Mars Volta, to be honest. This is usually not a sort of record I'd enjoy. I guess I like the Fugazi-inspired at the drive-in and \\"De-Loused\\" enough for me to also be more open-minded to this sort of thing. It is prog & then it isn't. I like it somewhat less than the debut, but that does not mean that this isn't worth a listen. It is. The slower numbers tend to be more dread and depressing, but for me, the highlights are where there Latin roots come out. The first part of \\"Cygnus\\" is repeated at the end, which sort of makes me wonder if they were inspired by the likes of \\"Animals\\" by Pink Floyd whenever making this. That's a great part of the album, though. The guys do seem a little bit pretentious, but for some reason that does not bug me. And in spite the long length of the songs, you can find hooks all over the album. <br /> <br />However, one thing that sort of bugs me is that just to stop the record label from marketing the album as an EP, they had to stretch \\"Cassandra Geminni\\" over in eight tracks. It just doesn't make sense to listen to these out of their order and context, for me at least. Track 6 even sounds like it is supposed to start somewhere from the last track. That's even a wonderful track, but I think it weighs down the album a bit. \\"Cygnus\\" was breathtaking for me, it reminded me of listening to the Refused's B-side \\"Poetry Written in Gasoline\\" on the part where the tempo began changing. And if you like the stuff to be more depressing, you can have it with \\"The Widow\\" and the beautiful \\"Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore.\\" I guess there's something the band pulls off that makes the album aurally pleasing. And then there's the moving centrepiece, \\"L'Via L'Viaquez,\\" which shows their Latin sound the most both in most of the lyrics and in the progressions. The group has moved the right direction on here. Someday I will try the new album. <br /> <br />Irecommend this album to anyone with enough of an open mind. It may take patience to truly enjoy the album, but it will come to you. Enjoy it.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This is the best CD i've picked up in awhile. They haven't achieved any legendary sound or anything but its got some good solid tunes and they switch it up alittle. All in all this is a great new band. I'll be looking forward to what they put out in the future.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is more than a movie about a dysfunctional family. It's a movie about paradigms that come together in a violent way...except Dayton and Faris make it all seem amusing.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine takes postmodernism and places it into the form of film. What the movie does well is the same thing that seems to be so hard to wrap our minds around - being the disintegration of relationships and seeming redemption through failure. There seems to be a strain of sentimentality while still yet declaring that the family and roles in a family aren't altogether important.<br /><br />Overall, LMS is a fun, funny, and wonderful slice of Americana. It takes ideas such as superficiality in life, self centeredness, and broken people with [sometimes] transcendent thoughts and strings the viewer along in one misadventure onto another. The movie explores failure in relationships, in occupation, and in general occurrences and various interpretations and reactions of the same failures through the eyes of the characters involved.<br /><br />Definitely not my favorite movie, but definitely worth watching.

B00008BLAS|4.0|I've come to appreciate more then ever the post-Terry Knight era of Grand Funk Railroad (in particular their 'Good Singing Good Playing' album) and 'Shinin' On' is nearly as good as its predecesor 'We're an American Band'.  Having Todd Rundgren produce was a genius move, since GFR by 1973 could have used some better production and overall help in bringing out the best in what they could do.   Standout tracks for me are the title track, \\"Carry Me Through\\" and \\"Destitute adn Losin'\\"  Of this period of GFR I would also recommend the very underrated and overlooked Born to Die album.
0790731452|5.0|Around the well known sociological fever that invaded minds and afforded fruitful markets in the fifties about the theme of the alien invasions in flying sauces, possibly never before in the annals of the genre of sci-fi we had had the chance to watch such incisive, demolishing and cynical satire respect the inner fears, and the psychological devices displayed for the different layers of the body social.<br /><br />I mean, behind the apparent facade of a funny entertainment we should begin to realize what' s going on behind stage. The presence of Jack Nicholson as the President of the nation talks by itself, as well as the somber labyrinth of hidden interests nestled bellow the carpet, the way the collective paranoia is handled, the role of the mass media and the weird behavior of the human race before certain unthinkable situations, are marvelously mirrored in this hallucinating and terribly intelligent film.<br /><br />You consciously might overlook more than one aspect, but sooner or later it will blossom.<br /><br />\\"It's a real pity the nuts cannot talk seriously about the quotidian insanities of the normal people\\" William Shakespeare.
0142000655|5.0|Detailing the intertwining stories of the Trask and Hamilton family, John Steinbeck weaves an amazing story of the many aspects of life. Steinbeck chronicles the development of the Hamilton and the two generations of the Trask family, providing a thorough outlook on life as seen through the characters. Although the volume of the book is daunting, the chronology of events is extremely interesting and enjoyable to read. <br />The first installment of the story centers around the development of the Trask family and the relationship between brothers Charles and Adam Trask, covering a variety of themes that are common to daily life. Charles is extremely competitive and constantly seeks to prove his physical prowess by defeating Adam in matches of ability. Adam, on the other hand, tries to escape his brother's anger by letting Charles take the upper hand, but arouses Charles's jealousy when he wins their father's attention. Charles however, loves his brother, but is incapable of expressing this affection, an issue common amongst siblings. The theme of sibling relationship and rivalry is present in these early chapters of the book, along with motifs of jealousy and love.  <br />As the story progresses, Adam falls in lust with Cathy, a beautiful and manipulative girl, quickly advancing the plot. Cathy epitomizes evil as she uses her beauty to her benefit. Upon the birth of their two sons Cal and Aron, Cathy abandons Adam and leaves him to sulk about the house. However, their Chinese servant, Lee assumes responsibility of caring for Cal and Aron, and helping Adam get back on his feet. Throughout the incident, Adam and Lee develop a relationship with and receive help from the Hamilton family, who are of Irish descent, and thus intertwining the two families.  <br />In the second installment of the book, Steinbeck chronicles the growth of the second Trask generation, Cal and Aron, who are replicated after the figures of Cain and Abel in the bible. While Aron receives praise andrevel in the love and attention of those around him, Cal is enshrouded in his brother's shadow and grows dark and mysterious. However, the progression of events accompanies dramatic changes within each character, emphasizing themes of dark and light and the affection between brothers. The intricate plot makes the book a great choice for those seeking high quality writing and a great read.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|-This is the first time seeing any version of this story/movie and I thought it was AMAZING! The sets, costuming and acting on the part of Gerard Butler will be very hard to live up to if any other version of this film is ever made in the future. And after watching other versions of it since seeing this one,I think that hard to live up to is the way Andrew Lloyd Weber wanted it!
B000002UZ1|5.0|The BLUE and RED ALBUMS make more sense to me now than they did in when they were first compiled in 1973.  At the time, it just seemed like a blatant marketing move, but that was when many of us were immersed in Beatles albums, and would not settle for a \\"superficial greatest hits.\\"  In reality they were always indispensable because they included so many great singles that were not on the regular albums.<br /><br />CDs changed the way we listen to music (you don't have to get up and change sides every 20 or 30 minutes, and you can program out cuts you don't want to hear), and while you can of course create your own collection, this is pretty close to perfection as a hit singles highlights gets for the late Beatles.  Perfect for driving!  These discs only contain about 60 minutes of music, and it could be 80, but by the 1990s the 1973 collections were classics themselves.  I can't give the set less than 5 stars considering the music that it DOES include!<br /><br />Personally, one of my gripes was always that REVOLVER should have been in the BLUE ALBUM so that all the late psychedelic music would be together.  Some other ideas to make what is nearly perfect even better --<br /><br />1) Substitute George's \\"It's All Too Much\\" for \\"Lucy In the Sky.\\"  George's great song ended up stuck on YELLOW SUBMARINE, but it was part of the SGT. PEPPER'S sessions, and is a much better song than LSD.  2) Move \\"A Day in the Life\\" so that it follows \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\".  3) In the animal department, substitute Paul's \\"Blackbird\\" from the WHITE ALBUM for \\"Octopus's Garden.\\"  4) Substitute John's \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" from the WHITE ALBUM for John's \\"The Ballad of John & Yoko,\\" a non-album single which I never liked.  The former is Lennon at his subversive best, and the song works just as well with Iraq as the backdrop as it did with Vietnam.  5) Substitute Paul's \\"Two of Us\\" from LET IT BE for George's \\"Old Brown Shoe,\\" a non-album single.  6) Substitute John's \\"Rain,\\" a non-album single (B-side to \\"Paperback Writer\\" from 1966, currently available only on PAST MASTERS, Vol. 2), for Paul's reggae-influenced \\"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da.\\"<br /><br />The late Beatles worked on multiple levels, and what was just immaculate pop to some represented emerging higher consciousness to others.  Those seeds of enlightenment are still in the music, and we need them more than ever!ute John's \\"Rain,\\" a non-album single (B-side to \\"Paperback Writer\\" from 1966, currently available only on PAST MASTERS, Vol. 2), for Paul's reggae-influenced \\"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da.\\"<br /><br />The late Beatles worked on multiple levels, and what was just immaculate pop to some represented emerging higher consciousness to others.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|If you can just switch off the World as you watch, and let yourself be drawn in, this is such a beatifully made movie that you could believe the story really happened. With a wonderful score (giving each main character a unique theme) and an unexpected baddie in .. - well, i won't spoil it(!) it's truly a feast for the ears as well as the eyes. <br />With all the modern effects and computer-generated imagery of today, it's sometimes difficult comprehending that the scenes and the sets you see on the screen are actually there for real - railroad 'n' all. <br />Lots of modern 'extras' produced especially for the DVD - sensitively and affectionately remembered by all the remaining cast members. Amazing 'then and now' gallery made me want to go visit the entire list of locations. <br />In true spaghetti western slow-cooking bot-boiler style, nothing significant happens with any urgency. The first scene is over fourteen minutes long - the conclusion of which is intriguing enough to grab you for the entire movie. <br />The men are rugged and the women (woman) gorgeous. <br />You'd never guess the revelation revealed towards the conclusion, that teases you all the way thru. <br />A movie that truly makes you feel that you've actually witnessed an entire chapter of life and death that actully went on 'once upon a time in the west'. <br />Bellissimo.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|\\"Love\\" is the proper title for this CD. I love this CD. Loads of original Beatles music remastered by the Beatle master himself, George Martin. Martin has taken the old songs and given them a new twist. Using the original masters of the songs and cutting and adding more original material gives us a unique insight into the world of the Beatles. Every time I listen to this disk I hear something new. Kudos to George Martin. I can't wait to go to Vegas to see the live show.
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|Pardon me whilst I rant about this movie.<br /><br />First of all - let me get this off my chest - I will admit that when I saw this film for the first time in 1997, I was rather awed by it.  And - even more embarrassing - when it came out on VHS some time later, I bought it right away, &lt;mumble> maybe even the first day it was released &lt;/mumble>.  I watched it several times after that and, I assume, enjoyed it.  This may be attributed to 1) Billy Zane's personal heat quotient or possibly 2) the movie's visual lushness which is, admittedly, amazing or even perhaps to 3) the Titanic's enduring mystique.  Watching that gorgeous ship with all of those gorgeous people break in half and go down the bottom of the Atlantic brings it home in a way that a book, even a picture book, really can't.<br /><br />However, it must be said that the storyline that weaves all the Titanic information together in this piece is incredibly weak and unbelievable, and both Jack (Leo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) are both immensely annoying.  Especially Rose.  Old Rose is a bit more palatable, but not by much.  I mean, what kind of old lady travels across the globe to the middle of the ocean with a gazillion framed pictures, most of them of herself?  Ack.  This is not immediately apparent to the viewer, but if you do the math (1997 minus 1912 subtracted from Old Rose's stated age) Young Rose is 16.  Sixteen.  No wonder she's so self-involved, shallow, defiant, and passive agressive.  She's sixteen.  She's basically teenage dressmaker's doll who's had a little continental polish, enough to blather on about art and think she knows something about it.  But she's not old enough or worldly enough to realize that her life with her future husband, obnoxious as he is, will be a thousand times easier and more pleasant than the life of anyone traveling, oh, say, four decks below her.  James Cameron's endowment of Rose with his own late 20th century goals of feminist self-actualization seems at best awkward.  When Rose whines about having to marry to make her life and her mother's life easier, you can't help but think of all the people in steerage who are headed for the coal mines or the sweatshops and happy about it just to give their children more opportunities in life.  Poor, poor Rose, consigned to a lifetime of art collecting and society lunches.  The heart breaks.<br /><br />But is Jack any better?  He seems to have no qualms about poaching another man's fiancee.  Or about deflowering a sixteen-year-old he has made to plans for or commitments to who would be ruined if that deflowering were made public knowledge.  He has nothing to offer her and no apparent history of gainful employment.  If DiCaprio weren't so anemic looking, his history of hobo-ing and hanging with prostitutes might seem - well, creepy.  But, of course, it isn't creepy because he never slept with those prostitutes.  Of course he didn't.  Nah.  And since from the moment of their meeting he's been devoted to helping Rose realize her true self.  Whatever that means.  Probably dragging her down several castes to where the real people live because it's more than GLARINGLY OBVIOUS that to Cameron rich equals snobbish, repressed, and controlling whereas poor equals carefree, happy, and friendly.  Isn't that what the back-to-back Rose-and-Jack-go-to-dinner scenes is supposed to telegraph to the viewer?<br /><br />Really, considering that the Titanic briefly housed some 2200 souls, it seems quite likely that at least 2150 of them might have been more interesting protagonists for this little morality tale.  The boat was full of millionaires, diplomats, presidential advisors, military men, and just plain brave emigrants on their way to a new life.  Second Officer Charles Lightoller , who Cameron manages to portray as a panicky coward, actually had survived several sea disasters, pestilence, a revolution, and being marooned on a deserted island.  After the ship sank, he managed to keep the overturned Collapsible B with thirty passengers calm and afloat all night.  What are the odds that he would let loading the lifeboats freak him out?<br /><br />It is only in the last third of the movie, when the ship begins its dramatic demise, that the film becomes really interesting.  The dynamics of the collision and its afteraffects - that's fascinating in a macabre fashion.  Titanic was so beautiful, so glamorous, that watching her list, take on water, come apart, and sink into oblivion is like watching a movie star go out in a pointless blaze.  Tragic.  Only its a muted tragedy because if - like me - the viewer isn't invested in Jack and Rose; the other 2200 people are so much floating luggage we never got to know.  No matter that there were hundreds of dramatic last moments, brides separated from grooms, fathers separated from wives and children, whole families who stayed in steerage because the calculated the odds of their being saved as nil - those stories aren't ones Cameron tells.  Instead we get Jack telling Rose that winning the Titanic ticket was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him because it meant he got to know and love Rose and sacrifice everything so she could thumb her nose at her Cal and her mother once more and become the true woman she was meant to be.  Gag.<br /><br />And then Old Rose drops a million dollar necklace into the sea in - what? - remembrance. What a waste.  Like this whole movie was.  The waste of an opportunity to make us see what a turning point Titanic was in history and why a two whole nations were shocked and stymied and appalled at what had happened that April night.keep the overturned Collapsible B with thirty passengers calm and afloat all night.

B000W10AEI|5.0|I love all the Harry Potter series, but this one needed the \\"deleted\\" scenes to help the movie move along. The story is about Harry fighting against his own subconscious mind as to whether he really is an evil wizard or not. Without knowing he could, Harry speaks \\"snake tongue\\" which is only found in wizards who are aligned with evil. From then on Harry starts questioning his actions and wonders if Voltomort and him have a very common bond. Could he turn evil and not be aware of it? (Harry confess is fear in delete scene 13) Maybe he has done things without being aware of his actions. The deleted scenes add this element to the movie and blu-ray puts the deleted scenes on the same disc. After watching the movie and then the deleted scenes, you know exactly where to put the scene into the movie.       In the deleted scenes, I found the most important plot manipulations, so you can follow the intent of the film and really get into Harry's mind. Below I listed the segments I found most important (deleted scenes #9, #11, #13). You just pause the DVD and move to specially features, then manipulate your cursor to the left side, about mid-way down to deleted scenes. Then press the number you want and watch the scene. The movie will go right back to where you left off after your clip.  #9 --  (where Harry is talking to a male student with a muggle (non-magic) parent, then a minute later a snake starts to attack this boy. Everyone thinks Harry is encouraging the snake to attack. But Harry is trying to calm him down -- he just didn't know he was speaking a language that no one else could speak. Unknowingly, he is a very rare gift that is usually only given to very powerful wizards.  #11 --  (deleted) All the students are talking behind Harry's back while he listens. They claim he is a dark wizard and can not be trusted especially if your parents are muggles.  #13 --  Harry and his friends watch as the school leaves for Christmas break. This is where he speaks about his own fears. That he could be doing something evil and not even be aware of it. This just needed to be in the original!!!    These other 2 are just funny and cute to watch.  #14 -- Harry and Ron give a drugged cupcake to Draco's goons. They pass out and are dragged to a closet to sleep off the drug.  #15 -- The goons wake-up and stagger out of the closet just in time to Harry and Ron coming back. Their shape-shifting potions is wearing out, but they still look so much like the other guys that everyone starts thinking they are seeing themselves in a mirror. The comedy of their reactions is so classic and it always makes me laugh.  This processes makes it a little more work,a but it is worth it.!!!    Needless to say the HD has intensified the clothing, ghosts and all special effects. The carved gold filigre is awesome the atmosphere is a touch more intense. The magical hiding cloak is excellently a beautiful irridesant cloth.   Now you watch all the deleted scenes and find out what is most important to you and put them in as you watch the movie.  ---  All I have to stay is Blu-ray shows better quality film, and with the deleted segments it completes your ability to understand the mental pressures hanging around Harry and his gang.  I needed this DVD to reach into the mind of Harry Potter in his 2nd year at school. Hope you feel the same way. Harry is different from most wizards and he knows it. He is forming a group of friends that will follow him anywhere. It reminds me of being the teenage outcast, with only a few really close friends.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It wouldn't be the first time that Fox cancelled a great show, when they canceled Firefly. And I doubt it will be their last.  <br /> <br />Like Buffy and Angel, the humor really made this hour long drama something special. Unlike, Buffy and Angel, the humor seems more grown-up, perhaps more socially relevant (if one wishes to compare the struggle against Alliance Control the that of modern day political struggle against certain \\"regimes\\"). <br /> <br />The characters are well-developed and unique (yet still part of the creative unconscious, so recognizable). The set of Serenity is fabulous. I never once questioned that it was a spaceship.  <br /> <br />And though this TV show fits into the Sci-fi genre, it is also part western. The small town with dirt roads and traveling by horse back are just as present in this show as are the floating houses, hovering vehicles, and spacesuits. <br /> <br />When you throw a preacher, two fugitives (one a doctor, the other a trained assassin), an honorable thief, a money-hungry mercenary, a companion (a guilded prostitute), a female mechanic, a warrior woman, and a wise-cracking pilot together, put them on a beautiful, insect-shaped (aka firefly) shaped spaceship, and send the Alliance (the \\"evil\\" for the good of mankind government) after them, you've got a great show. <br /> <br />If only Fox had done this one right, maybe it would still be on the air. (check the liner notes: Fox didn't even start with the pilot...). <br /> <br />A great show, that had great momentum, but got cut short.  <br /> <br />After you watch this, you'll be wanting to watch the movie \\"Serenity.\\"

B000I0QK74|2.0|Sorry, folks, I know this will make me unpopular, but this album goes way beyond bland! Sounds as though all involved had a jolly, old, subdued, old time. This includes the wimpiest version of \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" that could ever possibly be recorded. How can you take a tune as magnificent as that and turn it into mush, as they did on this album. If you want to hear a respectable version, one that does the tune justice, listen to the Moody Blues, \\"December\\" from 2003.

0307346609|3.0|Read this over the course of 3 nights.  Fast paced and entertaining; ultimately by the end it had as much substance as a fast food cheeseburger.   Last third became repetitive, the book was all too obviously written by a sketch writer in search of a movie deal.  The format, instead of being innovative was really just an easier way to write the book because the author then didn't have to worry about too deep of a backstory or deep characterizations.   <br /> <br />Having said that, there were some great scenes in the book including the Kansas church episode.  The Long Island scene was nice but would have been funnier if placed in Malibu or Beverly Hills.  <br /> <br />And this book is in no way a classic of the horror genre...compare this to The Stand (War Z is just an overlong version of the beginning sections of The Stand) or to something with more literary ambitions like The Road and you will find War Z isn't even close...not even area code close, more like a continent away from the excellence of those other, similar themed books. <br /> <br />However, War Z could make a cool movie :)

So the greek gods have chosen to settle in Western Civilasation, Since that is where they are respected the most.          \\"So I am the son of one of these 'gods' who DON'T EVEN EXIST!!!!!\\"             So says Perseus Jackson, son of Sally Jackson and \\"Posidon\\".                   This is a book about a boy whose father, he finds out is really the greek god Posiden and is called a \\"half blood\\" since he is half mortal-half emortal. Since, ancient greek myth monsters chase him everyhere around the United States he is always on the verge of dying. On TOP of that he is not the only half-blood. It turns out that there is a whole CAMP of half bloods. He has to go to that camp and there meets a daughter of Athena named Annabeth. Annabeth, himself and a saytr (goat on the bottom half, man on the top) have to go on a long perilious journey to go to the underworld and clear his name because he is acused of stealing Zeus's master thunder-bolt. He only has untill the summer solstice and if he doesn't sucseed...       He will probobly die!                This book is great for lovers of fantasy and science fiction. I happen to love it for those reasons and on top of that, for having a love for Greek Mythology and it is also definetly about that! It doesn't have any pictures but makes up for that in words. It is not to long and a fantastic quick read. All ages can probobly read it but I wouldn't recmond it to anybody under seven since it is kind of scary for little kids.       It is by Rick Riordan and the first in the series called Percy Jackson and the Olypians.          Give \\"The Lightning Thief\\" a try!!!!

B000BB1MHS|3.0|I have to say that this movie get a 3 because the first movie disturbs 5 sorry this movie isn't the greatest its okay!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Spine chilling scenes and heart warming scenes. <br />Witty humour and breath taking suspense. <br />Heart wrenching events and dark revelations. <br />Excellent show.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|Owned the original and saw the Pretenders in concert in 1981 and 2006.  This is great -- great new tracks and great demos of old tracks.  I love these 2 CDs.
0743298020|5.0|Reading The Thirteenth Tale is like eating a delicious piece of gourmet chocolate...each bite needs to be savored and you are sorry when it is done.  I was captivated by the beautiful writing in this book and carried away to mist covered mansions by the mysteries and secrets shared by the characters each time I turned a page.  Like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Rebecca, I have added this book to my list of favorites.  Excellent!
B00005LC1H|5.0|I got these for my parents, we watched them together when I was a child.  It was a great thrill to have them again.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Could not even get past the first 30 mins.  The language was f everything no idea what the story line was. Do not waste your money.
1845761502|5.0|It's about time Stan Winston produced a book about his studio! But, the wait was well worth it. <br />In a world of computer graphics it's refreshing to see REAL artists at work using their hands and not keyboards! <br />I'm still reading the book but what I've seen so far is awesome. The writing is riviting and the photos are very well done. <br />This book is at the top of my list of all time STUDIO books. ILM's being number 2 and Jim Henson's Creature Shop number 3.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|This film had a great cast. I cannot complain about the acting. The problem is that the film crawls along at near snails-pace most of the time. Not much is explained about the main characters powers. Are they real or fake? I would guess fake, but it is not exposed in detail. The \\"twist\\" to the story was obvious to me from the time the \\"murder\\" took place. I was not surprised at the end.<br /><br />All in all a film worth seeing. But dont expect any action or edge-of-your-seat suspense. You wont find it here. All you get is great acting and a slow, yet interesting story. It's an average film in my opinion.
B0000AOV85|4.0|As most everyone has said, this is a very informative and entertaining documentary on the making of Dark Side of the Moon. What it does is basically interview Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright, and several other people, throw these alongside of in-studio glimpses into how certain fragments of certain songs were created, and actual segments from the songs. Each chapter deals either with Pink Floyd's development after Syd Barrett but before DSOTM, or with a song from the album. <br /> <br />The bonus features are great, but given the short running time of the actual presentation, they really aren't bonus at all but simply portions of the documentary categorized into a different section. Some of them, like \\"Waters' World View\\" don't fit into the structure of the actual presentation, but are still very good to listen to for any Pink Floyd fan. <br /> <br />This documentary, then, despite its shortness, answers pretty much every question you could have about the album, and plenty of stuff you probably never figured to ask. Ever wonder why the pyramid was chosen as the symbol? Or where they got those voices at the beginning and end of the album? It's all in here.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Some cds that are digitally remastered are very good, and some are unbelieveable like this one. For those of us who remember the Beatles, and who bought every album, and some of the cds, this cd convinces you that it was just recorded yesterday!
B00005JJX8|5.0|Just watched the movie last night. It has been a couple years since we last watched it. We enjoy Europe and the French Riveria is a great place to see in the background throughout the story. I enjoy both Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Two great stars and beautiful people. The costumes and the settings are wonderful. Good stuff!
B000HEWEE4|4.0|An American adaptation of Hyun-Seung Lee's film \\"Siworae,\\" \\"The Lake House\\" charms its audience with a fairly innovative concept: sci-fi romance. (Yes, \\"Somewhere in Time,\\" starring Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour, also toyed with this idea in 1980 . . . but few have done so since). Now, there are some very familiar strains heard in this film (both American and Korean). NONETHELESS, the \\"heart\\" of this movie triumphs over whatever cliches you might find.    Moreover, I have read some complaints that the film is either A.) difficult to follow OR B.) inaccurate. Neither are true. Initially, you have to puzzle through \\"who is where\\" . . . but we are SHARING the characters' own confusion (it is meant to bond us to the film). Soon, the film clarifies (as the characters situations become clear to THEM) and we can enjoy the love-story:) And, yes, the writing makes perfect sense. If you have ever unraveled the physics of Kelly's \\"Donnie Darko\\" . . . or simply delighted in a time-travel film . . . you will understand HOW this all works out:) And, even if you have not done either of these things, I'm willing to bet that you will not get lost or frustrated with this film.    Reeves and Bullock portray their characters tenderly and convincingly. (They both just keep getting better-looking . . . which gives us thirty-somethingers hope for the future!!) Moreover, there is just enough tension in the film to keep the audience \\"guessing\\" . . . trust me. Ohhh, and did I mention the adorable canine who obviously has some pact with cupid?!!     No, this film isn't perfect, but that hardly matters. Put your \\"intellect\\" on hold for an hour and a half, and just enjoy this film for what it is.  (Hide it from your girlfriend if you are too embarrassed to watch with her the first time through . . . and then share it with her later . . . don't forget the tissues!!)    Frequently, I advise to see the original (especially after a cavalcade of bad Asian adaptations) but this one succeeds inits intended goal!! Kudos.    If what you want is a genuinely romantic film (without pretense), then see this one:)
B000IZJZLM|4.0|I was introduced to Il Divo a few weeks ago when I saw them on a television segment.  I could not believe the voice blend of this group.  They are absolutely magnificent!  I ordered this Siempre CD and The Christmas Collection CD.  My only complaint with the Siempre CD is that they only sing one song in English (Somewhere).  It would have been nice to hear 'Without You' and 'Tell That To My Heart' in English too.  However, I love their voice blend so much that I try and overlook the fact that I can't understand a word they sing :-)
0920668372|5.0|This is the sweetest book I've ever read.  I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who cried while reading it.  It's simply wonderful.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Listening to the sound track to get ready to see the play soon.
B000IHY9UW|3.0|\\"Pam joined him three years later . . .\\" is on my copy of the 15 Year Anniversary Edition; the movie is the same as the Special Edition.    The packaging and menus are updated and look great. Substantially better than the special edition.     On to the 2 new features.    The Doors in L.A. - 20 minute feature; Robbie Krieger, John Densmore, (yaaay!), Jimmy Greenspoon, and Pamela Des Barres are the prominent interviews on camera here. Nothing earth shattering, but it's nice to see/hear John Densmore's abridged opinions.    The Jim Morrison Phenomena in Paris - it's interesting. You've got a handful of people who met JDM in Paris and hung out; they describe his mood and what he was (arguably) saying at the time. There's a French librarian who breaks down a lot of the parallels in the subtleties of the lyrics w/Greek literature. There's a somewhat annoying 20 something saying Jim was done with music and The Doors and blah, blah, blah that isn't substantiated w/anything. There is an interview w/Michelle Rudler, who is listed as \\"Coroner\\" who says lots of things were done wrong in the documentation of Morrison's death. It's about 50 minutes.    All of the extras on the Special Edition are here as well.    So in conclusion, if you are looking to purchase The Doors movie on DVD, by Oliver Stone, this is the one to get. The movie is entertaining enough but, you know, it's fictional and not historically accurate enough to garner more than 3 stars from this reviewer.
1591841216|5.0|Fast. Easy. Use it as a one-a-day spark or in-a-sitting jolt. Paul Arden reminds the reader that creativity and beyond the box thinking are not only necessary but also crucial in every type of situation, whether a person tends to think from the left or the right side of the brain.
B000HEWEJO|4.0|<br />This movie is great. I ordered it thinking it was in color. <br />The web page had the format in color, but when I received it, it  <br />was in black and white. I was very disappointed that it was not in <br />color. I do not know who made the mistake but I looked online later <br />and they had changed the format to black and white. I decided to keep it since it is such a great movie. I would enjoy it better if it was in color. I wish someomne would give us the option to have it in color.
0618680004|5.0|While my review wouldn't contribute substantially to what's already been written, I did want to add another positive review to the queue so the statistics slant toward 5 stars. Dawkins book (and those like his) are finally cracking into the mainstream literature, and it's well worth reading this book if you're like me and have had the exact same argument with your religious friends for decades. He makes some very clear points, well grounded, and thoughtfully written. His analyses of the Old Testament had me doing two things: checking his facts in my Bible and rolling on the floor in tears, laughing hysterically.
B00067BBQE|5.0|One of the finest DVD's I have ever purchased. If you are a fan of Evanescence or just a fan of music, this is a must have.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch this film but I wa pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  The film had a well-developed plot and back-story; the acting was good for such a young and little-known cast; and the effects were cutting edge.  The Covenant is great escapist fun, but even if you go into it expecting nothing mroe than that you'll be surprised.
0375505091|2.0|I found the volume too personal to enjoy.    I enjoyed the PBS special so much more.  It gave me the insight that I wanted into the personality and approach to photography that is unique to Ms Leibovitz.   I did read many reviews prior to purchasing the book, and I still had to buy it and form my own opinion.  Without a doubt Annie Leibovitz is a master photographer, and this book would probably appeal to many. But I find family and death a bit to personal for me to share with strangers.
B00006JDU9|2.0|I know that there were a legion of geeks just counting the years for this film to come out. Fans of the original Star Wars movies just couldn't wait. I'll admit that I too had enjoyed the originals. But that's because I was born in the late seventies and I was a kid when I watched them. When you're a kid you don't care about things like plotline, or dialogue or acting. You just want to see some good lightsaber fighting. Now when this film came out I had somewhat lost interest in Star Wars movies, but I thought I would still give it a shot. Disappointing. Something happened to me since 1980. I grew up. Now I have to expect more from a film than just state of the art special effects. Sub-par plot line,  mediocre acting, and completely uninteresting one-dimentional characters were just some of the disapointments in this film. Even Liam Neeson (whom is a good actor by the way) was not used to his full potential.<br /><br />The only plus in this movie was the lightsaber fight at the end. The character Darth Maul had some impressive moves and the visual effects were worth seeing. Maul played by an actor with some talent (not necessarily in the acting department) but in the martial arts/acrobatic department, made the saber battle worth watching.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this movie did not live up to the old movies. The original trilogy wasn't especially great when it came to acting or dialogue, but at least the characters were somewhat interesting and had some mild chemistry between them. In this film, virtually none of that. Fans of the originals should be disappointed. And as for George Lucas, hang your head in shame.
0743270754|5.0|This book is much more than a historical disection of the Lincoln cabinet.  It is a page turner that I could not put down.  Anyone interested in real leadership, managing difficult personalities, and facing incredible odds with dignity and humor will find this book fascinating.  I loved this book and passed it on to my father - he couldn't put it down either.  Goodwin's writing leaves you wanting more, and it left me devastated by Lincoln's assasination.  The best book I've read in a long time.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I remember first seeing this movie in the theater in 1980 at the age of 6, and becoming so obsessed with it that I drew the characters endlessly (at one point when I was older I won an art contest and received a private tour of the Disney animation studio in Burbank, CA). I also remember the frustration I felt at how long it took Disney to release it to home video, which finally happened when I was a teenager. The story is lovely and the characters absolutely wonderful and memorable, the songs are not overdone and are a nice addition rather than a distraction, and overall this is a movie that adults can enjoy as much as children. The extras DVD with this edition is great with a lot of enjoyable material, especially about the history of the development and artwork of the movie. I highly recommend this edition for Disney lovers, animation lovers, and anyone who loves an engaging and charming story.
B000BKJ6WW|5.0|I watched this DVD at least three times the first time I put it in the player.  Even the most informed of Floyd fans will gain information off of this DVD.  Fortunately, I read the reviews of others before buying the documentary on Wish You Were Here.  As good as this DVD is, is how poor the \\"Wish You Were Here\\" DVD is.  Buy this today!!! <br /> <br />
B00000K413|4.0|I heard the promo for the new X-Box game \\"gears of war\\" and said to myself, \\"I know that song!\\"  Sure enough, after some before work googling I figured out that it was Tears for Fears a group that I listened to quite a bit back in the '80s, the track \\"Mad World\\".  I went ahead and purchased this, received it in a week and quickly ripped it to my computer.  I've been listening to tracks from this album ever since on my mp3 player.  A good trip down memory lane!
B00005U122|5.0|I have every album the Floyd ever put out and most DVDs Gilmour and Waters have been associated with and have to say this is a fantastic journey through time.  While David Gilmour and Company delivered a stellar performance in \\"Pulse\\" Roger proves that he was a driving force lyrically and his choices of vintage Floyd classics to perform in this live performance do not disappoint.  Although my favorite Floyd album is Wish You Were Here, my favorite song on this DVD is \\"Dogs\\" off the Animals album - simply amazing.  For you lead guitar enthusiasts, Roger has two of the finest I have ever watched.  Any Floyd fan would consider this a key component in their collection.  I was living less than 200 miles away when this concert was performed and am ashamed to have not known it was coming.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|When I purchase an album, I expect to hear music that I enjoy, that is played and sung with commitment, and that aims at some worthy goal - like healing a self-destructing world.  This album is all that.  I don't believe that musicians have to be constantly coming up with bigger and better things - leave that to the consumer culture.  This is music worth listening to, which is more than 90% of the pablum put out today can say for itself.  Get this cd and set aside some time to lie back, relax and take it all in.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I have been listening to this album for about a month and it is hard to believe all of this thoughtful, original, dynamic music is on one album by basically one person.  BUY this!
0743201140|5.0|Understanding your own strengths and those of people around you at home and work helps you strengthen your relationships and results. It helps you understand that people live and work out of their strengths.  My suggestion is to buy it on-line, not at a book store, as people cherry-pick the codes on the dust jacket and from Amazon, you KNOW the code for the inventory has not been used.  Was great discussion for our family and more than one work setting.  Love the concept and the work.  Easy, engaging read for something this significant.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Our 7- and 5-year-olds love it.   <br /> <br />Plenty of good stuff in here for the adults too, since on the 2nd (and 3rd and 4th...) viewings you notice clever little things in the background.  Pixar really \\"sweats the details\\" and it makes for a great experience.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I can't stop thinking about this movie and have watched it twice now since it's arrival. Based on the majority of reviewers here, other people got the message, there it seems that retired electrical engineer Eugene Keech is hell bent on disproving it all. The movie doesn't go that in depth into the Kyoto treaty or its provisions. It does however tell an extremely compelling story of our planet's history (to the tune of 650,000 years and 7 ice ages) and it projected future. How can one not see the pattern, see the exponential curve and still not believe that all Gore is doing is speaking on behalf of the scientific community.     Edit: Yes the huge chart that Al shows looks like it fits together ... that is until one discovers that there is an 800 year lag between higher CO2 and temperature. I feel misled by this. See the Google video here:  [...]    According to the data Gore presented it won't be 2100 when the S**T hits the fan but 2050 or less. Is it so hard to believe? Environmental changes are obvious, I found the break up of the Antarctic ice shelves particularly disturbing. but the crux of the matter is, are humans causing the climate changes? I no longer believe we are/do.    Will the economy crash if more fuel efficient cars are produced. Hmmmm, let's ask Toyota and Honda what kind of year they had. See the movie, share the movie, join the virtual march, buy some compact fluorescents (buy them at a club store to get them at less than $2 a bulb), do recycle, do lower your thermostat in the winter and raise it in the summer. Can one person do it alone; nope we each have to contribute. But not to combat \\"Global Warming\\" ... to reduce pollution, consumption, and waste.    Jay
B000002H97|4.0|No album is loved and hated by so many. Loved by music lovers that appreciate the brilliance and genius of this landmark album. Hated by true Metallica fans who insist the band sold out and will never be convinced otherwise. As for me, this is still the only Metallica album I own, but if \\"Enter Sand Man,\\" \\"Sad But True,\\" \\"Unforgiven,\\" \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" are selling out, then every band should sell out immediately. This is a fantastic album even if it doesn't satisfy everyone.
0761944524|4.0|Whoever thought a stats book could be both useful and fun? This book manages to be both. It came highly endorsed by an instructor I trusted but from a fairly serious-minded context. Imagine my surprise at the subtitle (\\"sex, drugs and rock n roll\\"). Stats is a necessary evil, given my research position, and does not comes easily to me. People often say to me \\"but you have a Ph.D.\\" I do, but it's in Anthropology, a field in which you are tacitly taught to distrust numbers and technology. So, having to know stats and use SPSS seemed like torture until I was led to this book. Now I at least have an understandable and friendly guide on my shelf to counteract the dour textbooks I have collected over the years on quantitative methods.
0861714911|5.0|I own many of the longer and complete translations of the Pali Canon available now and have spent years studying and teaching, to the best of my ability, the contents and character of each.  What I find most useful about Bhikkhu Bohdi's anthology is it's concise and focused selection of Suttas and the logic of the overall outline, making it an extremely useful learning tool of the heart of Buddhism.  Also, I took an extended trip recently and this was the only book of scripture I took along.  It's physical size combined with the translations themselves and Bhikkhu Bodhi's erudite and clear commentary made this a wonderful traveling companion.  If your Buddhist library can hold only one book, I highly recommend this volume.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The death of Jesus was graphic, very thought provoking, and frankly, probabaly the mostinspirational movie I have ever seen.  Those last twelve hours are very violent, but what else could it be.  Jesus was nailed to a cross.  Hung to die.  Blood and torture is shown throughout the movie but, that is how he died.  My wife wouldn't go so i went with my cousin.  We left the theatre in silence and didn't say a word until we were well into our trip home.  I think every Christian should see it.  it is the base on which our church is founded.  Jesus Christ suffered a violent death.  I think Mel Gibson showed it pretty much like it must have been.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I actually bought this without seeing the Director's Cut first, having only seen the theatrical release.  The theatrical release alone had made me cry, but that might have been issues I was having at the time.  Regardless, Donnie Darko is an excellent, mind-bending movie that makes you think.  The Director's Cut gave further illumination to the context of the story.  Not necessarily one to watch with the kids, but a brilliant movie, either way.
B00006CXFH|5.0|This movie sparked a love for \\"Tink\\" that my 3 year old is VERY eager to tell everyone about!  It's a must-have.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|Rising from the ashes of the excellent and unfairly ignored Carissa's Wierd, a unique creative vision survives the transition to guitar rock/country intact.<br /><br />The songs on this record are deceptive in their seeming simplicity, and like any truly great record, only repeated listenings will reveal the depth of these songs. They are multi-layered, shimmering and stirring, and anyone who gives the music proper time to move them will find an alt-country/pseudo-shoegazer gem of musical magic waiting.<br /><br />Four stars because it's shorter than it should be, and because 'Bass Song' isn't here.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This is a must have for any video collection.  The memories will last a lifetime.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Well done. I'm extremely proud of Groban for this effort.  His first album showed off an amazingly promising voice, though he was still an inexperienced performer.  \\"Closer\\" was by no means a sophomore slump; it was fun and poppy, capitalizing on \\"the voice,\\" but frankly, I would have been done with him if his third album had been similar to the second. <br /> <br />It's not.  I can totally see how some might not be able to connect completely with this album, but I fell in love at first listen.  No song is cheesy.  No song is eccentric.  Every single one, without exception, is a beautiful vehicle for his voice; every single one has an unexpected but not pushy character; every single one could be a single itself.  The melodies are untraditional without being strange.  \\"Mai\\" and \\"February Song\\" are right up his alley, but don't suck off from his first two albums.  His a cappella with Ladysmith Black Mambazo is a welcome departure, though I admit they wouldn't make the most successful a cappella group together, and that's fine: we want to listen to Josh Groban, not them together.  The Romeo and Juliet song is gorgeous, and he sings it...well.  Not brilliant, but very good.   <br /> <br />For me, at least, \\"Machine\\" is the essential track of the CD.  Groban never departs from his sound that has sold so well, but is able to stylishly and easily mix that genre with funk and jazz.  Subtle, moving, cool, dare I say...slightly sexy?  Great song. <br /> <br />Not perfect...but I haven't listened to anything in the past year that came as close.
6304806418|4.0|As a person who is not a big fan of movie musicals, I was thoroughly impressed by the magnificent performance of Madonna playing the title role and singing the immortal hit \\"Don't cry for me Argentina.\\" Jonathan Pryce and Antonio Banderas were also spectacular in their respective roles. <br /> <br />Andrew Lloyd Weber's musical genius is captured in this touching and historic portrayal of the life of Argentine First Lady Eva Peron. A peasant girl who used her charms and elegance as an aspiring entertainer and rises to become the wife of Argentina's most powerful politician is sequentially presented with song and dance that only a masterful musical producer such as Weber could create. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning about the life of an important poltical figure of the twentieth century and being delightfully entertained at the same.
0312323867|5.0|After reading Something Borrowed I wasn't sure if I wanted to read Darcy's story in something blue being that I found myself rooting for Rachel and Dex.  <br /> <br />Something Blue is just as funny and exciting as the first one! It offers the reader a chance to get to know Darcy, even if you find her to be shallow and self centered. You will find yourself rooting for her and maybe even liking her at the end. Something Blue is a MUST READ. Definelty worth the 5 stars
B0001Z363W|5.0|This Zakk's best work ever.  YES, you read that correctly.  The songs here are well thought out, both structuraly and lyrically.  It's nothing other BLS albums where the songs are 3 minutes long and Zakk and Craig just pound there way thru them.  Zakk sings with inflection and emotion that actually makes you feel the mood of the tunes.  The CD is best listened to with a clear mind,  not while detoxing from the night before!!!
0743454537|4.0|The book tackles a topic which could be true in todays society. the story is told by different characters, each giving you their version of the story.  It's a clever technique to keep the reader from choosing sides, and by giving almost all the characters a voice. The book has an unexpected ending, which will leave you surprised!! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, because it will leave you thinking at the end.
B000000993|4.0|I would descibe this CD as ol' school Black Sabbath mixed with Rob Zombie and a sprinkiling of Jerry Cantrell's Degradation Trip.  The bass line is exceptional thru out the whole disc.  The whole feel of the vocals are dark and gloomy.  Just a great great CD!!!
0385338694|3.0|The reason for the 3 stars is that I wasn't totally blown away by Kinsella's book, but I do recommend. The premise is funny, top lawyer has breakdown and ends up working as a housekeeper. It was an amusing book, easy to read. It's your typical chick-lit book.
B000GRUS22|3.0|I feel this album continues further along the path started with Voyageur.  Too much electronica, not enough ppl.  I wasn't happy with Voyageur on the whole, although it had high points, and I am even less happy with this album, although if I were assessing it as electronica, and not from an Enigma MCMXC a.d.-fan point of view, it would perhaps get 4 stars.  I would say i quite liked Goodbye Milky Way, Dreaming of Andromeda, and Eppur Si Muove/Feel Me Heaven.  If only Enigma would backtrack, at least as far back as Le Roi Est Mort...Vive Le Roi if not further, to give this fan a taste of the classic...
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Having first seen Grand Prix on multiple screen Cinerama during its theatrial run, it was one of the top \\"want to see\\" films on my list when I purchased my wide screen TV.  I was disappointed to find that it had not been released on DVD. <br />I purchased Grand Prix the week it became available and was not disappointed.  The story line is weak, yes, but the racing sequences are the greatest ever put on film.  The generous extra features give an inside look into the dangerous world of 1960s Formula One racing.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Miyazaki does it again with Spirited Away. another beautifully animated movie, with and adventure story that is both captivating and imaginative. <br /> <br />a must-have for fans of Miyazaki, anime and/or fantasy.
B000JBXLOM|5.0|The title says it all. As much as the end of Abbey Road defined the Beatles, This new mix redefines the Beatles. It's not your ordinary Beatle fare...it is an incredible remastering and George Martin insures with son Giles there is a base to all modern music and a base to all productions. <br /> <br />This is not anything you've ever heard, it is a simply extraordinary remastering of Beatle songs in a way you can't imagine. Simply amazing.
B00003CXBK|4.0|being of Japanese-decent myself, i have grown up on anime and in the Japanese culture, and perhaps have a deeper understanding and appreciation than most. however, one cannot help but be taken in by this movie and it's amazing scenes featuring a captivating imaginary world. <br /> <br />a great adventure and spectacle, it's a must-have for fans of anime and/or fantasy.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Well, it seems With George Martin well training his son Giles...one day we will all realize that the Beatles were even better than we ever knew. Just when you think there is nothing that can re-express there impact on music...BANG! This is a masterfull and brilliant remastering of a Beatles new mix that from the start is breath taking. Of course George Martin was without a doubt a musical magician inspired by the Beatles passing this legacy to his son we can be sure to hear more crisp and never before heard mixes. But never doubt the source of their insipration of such creativeness. The Beatles redefined music in every way as much as George Martin redfined producing what we hear. <br /> <br />As much as there is such musical magic at the end of the Abbey Road album...this is incredible. If you think it's just Beatle cut think again. This something you've never hear before and something anyone at any age will just say ... wow. Such a crisp remastered set of the original LP productions mixed with never before heard versions no wonder this is a Billboard top 10 album 40 years plus after the fact. It deserves repeating... <br />One of the greatest Beatles albums ever produced!!! <br />As a Beatle fan since the day the US first heard a tune and having every LP/CD ever made, this was just a mind blower! Buy it, get it listen to something extraordinary beatle fan or not.

B000001TVD|5.0|Okay, WTF? Seriously though, that has got to be the coolest opening line in history. And it opens arguably the coolest guitar solo in history. For ten minutes, Eddie Hazel blows Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Duane Allman, Santana, Jimmy Page, and every other guitar hero you've had off the map. He also puts stooges like Joe Walsh and Ritchie Blackmore in their places. He gets rage, joy, tenderness, sadness, and much more outta that thing... damn...<br /><br />1. Maggot Brain: 1000000/10. Have I mentined it's the best guitar solo EVER?<br /><br />2. Can You Get to That: 10/10. Always liked this number, a catchy little soulful thing with great harmonies.<br /><br />3. Hit It and Quit It: 10/10. Eddie Hazel strikes back, adding in ashort-but-sweet guitar solo. Good song otherwise.<br /><br />4. You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks: 10/10. George Clinton's Everyday People, a statement on racism made in the way only he could make.<br /><br />5. Super Stupid: 8/10. The lyrics need a bit of work, but Hazel rocks out.<br /><br />6. Back in Our Minds: 6.5/10. Good message, but only an average song.<br /><br />7. Wars of Armageddon: ...okay then/10.  A ten minute freakout a la Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow. It's weird, all right, but a good type of weird.

0446677450|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much. Highlighted quite a few things and the book  gave me helpful tools on how to handle my business. I agree that every individual should and continue to learn how to handle there financial affairs. I agree that there are only two classes of Americans the rich and the poor. There is no more middle class. We need to educate our children on how to prepare for retirement. I am a realtor and real estate hopefully is the key to my financial success. I have finally found my passion at this late stage of my career. My hope is that other people will find there passion earlier in there career.
B00003CXWV|5.0|even those who may not agree with Depp's life choices have to appreciate his acting ability. Blow is one of those great films which really gives him a platform to showcase just what an incredibly talented actor he is. <br /> <br />on the surface, it's a semi-biographical movie about drug dealers and smuggling, but contains a richness and real humanity that's usually missed in movies of this genre. <br /> <br />this movie is a must-have for your collection --- i watch it every 3 or 4 months, and with the limited amount of free-time i have, this is a sincere compliment.
0743442539|4.0|The book jacket for THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD says protagonist Alec Leamas is \\"on his last assignment: to adopt the role of a disgraced agent who goes behind the Iron Curtain to bring down the head of East German intelligence.\\"<br /><br />The maneuverings of Leamas and his associates are the focus of this entertaining spy novel. But the moral consequences of their intrigues only manifest near the end of the book, when a naïve librarian and clueless lover of Leamas is pulled into their deadly and treacherous game. At the book's conclusion, the disillusioned Leamas takes a moral position against a brutal and immoral act.<br /><br />I recommend this novel. But I deduct one star, since this brutal and immoral ending, the consequence of actions by many Intelligence operatives, simply reads like one final twist of the plot. For me, the story would have acquired heft had Leamas articulated his moral risks and choice earlier in the novel and then battled the consequences. This, of course, is the way heroes in some of Graham Greene's great novels struggle, before finding their integrity.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a fun read for LeCarre's fans who can see in this short book the first appearance of many techniques that have carried his brilliant career.
B000286RNY|2.0|i bought this movie after being blown away by the actor/director's masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle. <br /> <br />while it contains similar humor elements and near-anime-type action, it's really not worth the buy, and you would be better served by purchasing Kung Fu Hustle which is much funnier and overall a better production. i probably watch Kung Fu Hustle once every couple of months, which is no small complement.

B000H0MKOC|4.0|This movie focuses on a tobacco industry lobbyist, the \\"sultan of spin,\\" a man named Jack Naylor, who wants to excel at his less than scrupulous job while at the same time being a role model for his son. <br /> <br />His son seems to be fascinated by what he does for a living, and doesn't seem to be disturbed by his father's flexible moral base. The movie is meant to be tongue in cheek, Naylor lies for a living because \\"it pays the mortgage,\\" a line that a less than scrupulous reporter reuses on Naylor after sleeping with him and airing his dirty laundry in the paper the following week. <br /> <br />I would say that \\"unscrupulous\\" is a good word to describe both the movie and the majority of its main characters. But that's what makes it an effective, biting, sarcastic take on the lobbyist world, and on all those who put their personal interests ahead of everything else, including their own families.

B00004S5QN|5.0|When it comes to Arthurian legend most filmmakers can't seem to decide whether they want to treat it as history or as myth. It is irritating to see the magic and the mundane mixed. As Arthur points out- he  was not meant to live the life of a mortal man. Boorman and Pallenberg treated it as pure myth- sacred myth. In fact, this is the best translation of myth to film that I have ever seen.<br /><br />If you are looking for just a piece of light entertainment then you might want to avoid this movie. It draws you in- it stirs archetypes that reside deep in your soul. Awakening to such depths is not always pleasant, though it can be transformational.<br /><br />I've lost track of how many times that I've seen this film. It was one of the first videos that I bought when I got my first VCR and it was one of the first DVD's that I bought when I switched over. I've never \\"tuned it out\\" mentally while watching- it always manages to draw me in. I don't think that I've ever watched it with totally dry eyes. I find myself raised above my usual petty concerns to say, \\"my God, this is what it means to be a hero- this is what it means to rise above your little self to be a true knight who follows a true king!\\" Deep down, I think that everyone awaits the return of a true King- and to find and drink from the Grail. The latter is up to you. Follow...<br /><br />The story is an excellent compilation of the best of legend, the acting is uniformly fine, and the camera work is bigger than life. Something about this subject seems to have made everyone who participated in it rise above themselves. Perhaps, just perhaps, it may make you do the same.<br /><br />To be fair, when I first saw this film in the theaters I didn't quite \\"get it\\"- but I remembered almost every scene and it kept pulling at me. Then, after I came back to it in mid-life, I got it...<br /><br />This is the region two version- don't buy it unless you are sure that your player will handle it (and it probably won't in North America.)n't in North America.)   <br />

0375505091|5.0|This is by far one the very best photography books ever.Ms. Liebovitz is a master of the staged photograph, the ones we are more familiar with,which are beautiful and fanciful. But her personal photos, the ones from her soul, are gloriously intimate. So intimate that one, at first glance,is inclined to turn away. Yet each is so forceful one finds themself slowly taking a quick glance in order to get used to their power. If one doesn't then face them head on, studying them, indeed weeping over some, would be to miss out on something deeply true and touchingly raw.

Definitely a must for all children.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is one that most people will probably think I'm crazy for complaining about - a caterpillar spins a chrysalis around himself, not a cocoon.  Cocoons are what moths (and certain other insects) spin.<br /><br />So, when you read the book, be sure to say Chrysalis, not cocoon. ;-)

0385486804|4.0|I read Krakauers \\"Into Thin Air\\" some years ago and was really impressed with his writing--especially his ability to make me feel like I was gasping for air when he was writing about being in high up on Everest where the air is thin.  It was one the first nonfiction books I'd ever read that was as compelling and entertaining as a good novel.<br /><br />I recently finished \\"Into the Wild\\" and came away impressed again by Krakauer's writing.  I consider myself to have a pretty substantial vocabulary, but his writing still left me reaching for a dictionary at times; but I liked that--it's a sign of a writer who isn't afraid to alienate readers who don't want to be challenged.<br /><br />I knew from the cover that this was the story of Chris McCandless, a bright young man from my area who went into the wild (Alaska) alone and inadequately prepared.  What I did not know is that Krakauer was going to weave in countless other stories of men who had made similar treks.  It was heartbreaking to read Chris's story and fascinating to see the parallels between Chris and the many others who have gone to Alaska seeking the challenge of the wilderness.  I'm not a parent, but I was very touched by a scene with Chris's parents toward the end, and I think this would have to be a tough story to read if you are a parent--especially the parent of a headstrong young man like Chris.<br /><br />Even though my own seeking for adventure was only to move away from my small town at 18 and go to the big city 400 miles away for a job, I can read this book and certainly relate to the agita I caused my parents.  I was one of those kids who didn't share much--who I was dating, where I was going--and it wasn't until I was 50 when I took my mother on a cruise for her 70th birthday that she told me how difficult it was to let me go.  Having read this book, I have a lot better understanding of her heartache.
B00005JPAJ|4.0|Babel <br /> <br />Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has completed his trilogy of human sadness and isolation with his final installment of Babel.  His previous films in the trilogy are 21 Grams and Amores Perros.  His latest is an intense, depressing, and brilliant look into the way which we as humans perform miscommunication. <br /> <br />Babel is derived from the biblical story when man tried to reach heaven via a tower.    Upset with the idea, God stopped the construction by creating different languages.  Communication had become impossible. <br /> <br />The film is blessed with exceptional acting all around from actors and actresses of whom you probably have never heard.  Okay, everyone is familiar with Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt but the rest of the cast is mostly of no names, at least to  people here in America. <br /> <br />Babel easily could have been a lazy effort made by Director Inarritu.  How so?  A film with a running length of 142 minutes centered upon a simple idea of miscommunication doesn't sound very challenging, right?  Wrong.  This is where Inarritu has gone above and beyond.  It would have been all too easy for his characters to not communicate simply because of language.  Although the film does contain this aspect, the focus is primarily on the miscommunication of humans with the same language. <br /> <br />Richard (Pitt) and Susan (Blanchett) are on vacation in Morocco when a random bullet strikes Susan creating a chain of events for the viewer.  Yes, Richard has trouble communicating to the locals about getting help, but look closer.  A scene before this shows the couple unhappy with each other because of their child's death.  Their miscommunication with each other has created a break in their relationship. <br /> <br />The random bullet is revealed to have been shot from two children who have a brother sibling rivalry with each other.  The father's treatment of the younger brother causes the older brother to feel inadequate.  Adding tothe mix, the younger brother is confused and curious about his sexuality as he watches his sister undress (which she fully knows and fully enjoys the attention).  This indeed is a family that lacks in the area of communication of their problems. <br /> <br />Richard and Susan's kids are taken care of by mexican nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza).  Amelia is thrown into a probable predicament.  Amelia has her brother's wedding to attend in Mexico but Richard (because of his inability to listen) has insisted that she has no choice but to take care of his kids on her day off.  So what does she do?  Irresponsibly, she takes the kids with her to Mexico for the wedding and plans on bringing them back across the border into the States.  It's funny how going into Mexico sure is easier than coming back.  On the way back, she experiences the vigorous and ruthless laws of immigrating back into the U.S.  It's too bad the border patrol and Amelia refuse to listen to each other.  A tragedy of ghastly proportions ensues. <br /> <br />Meanwhile in Japan, Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho) is linked to the gun that has fired off the bullets.  He and his deaf daughter Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) are having father-daughter problems.  The suicide of Chieko's mother has caused a lack of emotions and communication between the father and daughter.  Both feel distant as a family, but Chieko's isolation continues into her social life.  Men don't want to have anything to do with Chieko because she is deaf.  This yearning of acceptance causes Chieko to communicate in the only way she knows possible, her body.  The show stopper occurs in a scene where Chieko stands fully nude in front of a detective.  Chieko has been stripped of her dignity appearing completely desperate and vulnerable.  Simply put, Rinko Kikuchi's character Chieko is the most fascinating and best part of the film. <br /> <br />As you can see, this is not a film merely about characters not understanding each other via language barriers.  There ismuch more substance going on.  Many of the film's lack of communication takes place within people who speak the same language but are not listening to each other and therefore not communicating.    <br /> <br />The film may feel slow to some and yet engaging to others.  The whole \\"every character is connected\\" idea seems overplayed and not as shocking as it once was.  This is largely due to previous films, such as Crash, exercising this same idea in the past (I still think P.T. Anderson's Magnolia is the best film that shows an interweaving complex story of characters that all connect.)   <br /> <br />But still, Inarritu has made a film showing that even though our cultures have led us to have different definitions of happiness with one another, we are all still connected as human beings because of the similarities of tragedy, death, and isolation we all feel.  To the core, we are all the same.   <br /> <br />Listen to this film, you will be rewarded.

B0000E2FLC|5.0|No need to repeat all the superlatives others have used. This is an amazing concert video.  <br /> <br />On the overdub/cleaned-up issue -- I don't think so. I'm no sound engineer, but I've recorded in studios and live and sat next to engineers when they do their work, and I'd say that every sound on this DVD came right from the signals/tracks that were fed into the live board. The sound quality is consistent throughout, esp. on Angus's famed Gibson SG. The sound is the real thing: raw, unfiltered, and with phenomenal power. Take great musicianship on great intruments, add top-of-the-line preamps, effects and mics, and this is what you get: bloody marvelous. <br /> <br />And Angus Young's coy striptease -- with the crowd adding its own barroom chant -- is brilliant.
B00005JP9V|4.0|Children of Men is based on P.D. James' sole sci-fi novel, in which an aging Britain faces the imminent extinction of the human race due to an unexplained epidemic of infertility. Cuaron has kept only the central premise, a few character's names, and the rough outline of the plot. In fact, for major parts of the film, it's easy to forget that there are no more children, as Cuaron seems more interested in making obvious and heavy-handed references to contemporary events such as Abu Ghraib, illegal immigration, the public reaction to the death of Princess Di, the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, etc. It's never explained how the fertility crisis is connected to the chaos in Europe and Asia that has sent hordes of refugees to Great Britain (nor why the semi-fascist government that is so intent on rounding up refugees in internment camps allowed them into the country in the first place), but it certainly provides an opportunity for one of the most visually stunning and meticulously realized fictional worlds I have ever seen on film. There's so much to absorb visually that the hackneyed plot and trite characterizations don't become obvious until well into the film. I can hardly wait for the DVD so I can watch it again with the sound off.

032147404X|2.0|When I got to the \\"About the Author\\" part, I thought, I was in front of a very good piece of information...very disappointed <br />This book must be meant for \\"Homer Simpson\\" pushing buttons in his panel without having a clue what is going on. \\"Oftentimes, it's just which button to push\\" \\"and not a whole lot of reasons why\\". Is that a good approach, if you like photography a little bit??... I do not think so. <br />Mr. Kelby is taking the easy way and avoiding the challenge of putting very valuable technical stuff in \\"plain English\\" ...that's a challenge, he is only tells you \\"which buttons to push\\" <br />On the other hand, Way too many jokes, I wanted a photography book not the comedy channel. <br />My conclusions, if you are \\"a bit\\" serious about photography DO NOT get this book <br />
B000GCFO0I|4.0|this was a great story. its a good dramatic horror flick surrounding a town whose people are extreme worshippers of god and are self consumened with blind faith. kinda has a modern day which hunt feel to it.

0684824906|5.0|A lot has been written about Abraham Lincoln's life and legacy but this book is one of the few, if only, to approach from a different angle and write about Lincoln's ability to manage a hugely diverse and talented political family.  Goodwin took ten years to compile this history and does an admirable job.  She describes his tragedies and failures as a  progression in his life instead of a deterrent.  Lincoln was the kind of man that the more that is known of him the better he is liked and Goodwin certainly likes him.  He was the catalyst that \\"kept the bottom in the tub\\" of his cabinet.  Lincoln had the most remarkable capability to forgive and forget past wrongs..as long as the issues were not continually pressed..he didn't hold anything against anyone.  The idea of never meeting anyone he didn't like or at least being able to find something positive about them is interlaced thorough out this book.  His humility and talent to understand human nature can be traced to the hardships of early life, his ungainly appearance and the vicissitudes of trying to make something of himself. He had the story tellers gift and could tell stories not only to relieve tension but more importantly to underscore a point.  All this served him well in the coming days.  His abilities played well in choosing the men for his cabinet.  All were rivals and either thought poorly of him or looked down on him as a second rate prairie lawyer.  These men were certainly some of the most talented ones for their respective jobs in the cabinet.  Seward, who became a genuine friend, as Sec. of State...Chase, who was financially brilliant but a thorn in the cabinet, as Sec. of Treasury...Stanton, who worked tirelessly, as Sec. of War...Bates, quiet and unassuming, as Attorney General...Wells, who built the navy from almost nothing, as Sec. of Navy...and finally Montgomery Blair, who greatly improved mail delivery, as Post Master General.  All these composed a most unlikely cabinet whose ups and downs Lincoln had to balance like trying to carrying two pumpkins on a horse.<br /><br />Lincoln not only had to balance the cabinet but he also had to deal with Union Generals.  Trying to get McClellan to cross the James was an almost impossible task but the scant successes allow Lincoln to get his Emancipation Proclamation underway and understanding the need to have public sentiment on your side was one of the hallmarks of his administration.  Lincoln possessed the foresight to moderate and mollify  with Legislature, Cabinet, and Generals.  Understanding the need for perfect timing, in doing anything, is the mark of a great statesman.  Goodwin intersperses this book with family relationships, hardships and tragedies.  She gives the Civil War battles a proper perspective and doesn't allow them to overrun the purpose of the theme.  With 757 pages of text and 123 pages of notes, this is not an overnight read but one that I found very compelling and delightful.  Highly recommended and well worth adding to the history shelf.ncoln had to balance like trying to carrying two pumpkins on a horse.

B00005J6UP|5.0|Maybe I should say \\"for teens\\" since the movie has some inappropriate language and situations, but I first saw The Goonies in my pre-teen years and loved it.  Heck, I continue to love it even to this day.  It's about a group of kids that find a treasure map in an attic full of old pirate antiques.  A pretty seamless transition then takes place, considering the unusual circumstances, where the kids follow the map to an old abandoned restaurant that serves as a hideout for a family of escaped convicts.  The rest of the movie is a wild chase for the kids, as they make their way through a booby-trap infested tunnel with escaped convicts right on their tail.  The creative booby-traps are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones, which shouldn't surprise anybody who watches movie credits, and even though the content is most unusual, the movie never loses it's believablity (except, perhaps, during the Superman shirt gag).<br /><br />This may very well be my favorite Spielberg film.
B00005JOCS|5.0|You'll read here and elsewhere about Jennifer Hudson's jawdropping performance.  It's incredible.  From the first second she opens her mouth, it's evident she's light-years beyond the other singing talents assembled here.  That includes Beyonc&eacute;.  Not Beyonc&eacute;'s character, Deena Jones, but Beyonc&eacute; herself.<br /><br />That said, the real story here is Eddie Murphy.  I thought he deserved an Oscar nomination for 'Bowfinger' (don't laugh - go back and watch).  And, here, you don't think \\"that's Eddie Murphy.\\"  You see James 'Thunder' Early up there.  He brings such amazing energy to the movie.<br /><br />To the contrary, you have Jamie Foxx.  I realize he's supposed to be playing an ill-tempered, Machiavellian character, but he seems to be seriously teed-off that he's in this movie.  Maybe it's because he  worked for well under his post-'Ray' $20M asking price, but he just doesn't seem to be happy sharing screen time with Knowles, Murphy, et al.<br /><br />Director Bill Condon is 3 for 3 now - 'Gods and Monsters,' 'Kinsey: Let's Talk Abount Sex,' and now 'Dreamgirls.'  What a track record.<br /><br />For those interested in the movie's sinuous trail to the big screen and how Condon came to be tabbed as director, get a hold of Vanity Fair's recent outstanding piece on the making of the film.  It's tremendously enthralling reporting.  Of special note is rights holder David Geffen's efforts to protect creator Michael Bennett's legacy.  If you stay through the movie's credits, you'll see that the movie-makers dedicate the movie to the memory of Bennett.
0385474547|4.0|Coming in as review #120+ there is likely little I can say that has not already been said.  But here are my two cents...<br /><br />Achebe's masterful work operates on so many levels that some may find it a confusing or challenging read.  Stick with it.  At the foundational level, the book offers a window into the very heart of a Nigerian tribe, its people, relationships, beliefs and customs.  Layered above the foundation, the story offers a personal connection, with the reader seeing in the protagonist, Okonkwo, one's own faults, strengths and insecurities.  Higher still is the overarching level of the insidious and arrogant invasion of the 'white man'.<br /><br />Achebe interweaves these and a multitude of other layers together to produce a work that is as relevant today as it was when he wrote it as it would have been in the days of Nigerian tribal life.  The folly of expectations of self, one's children, family and 'tribe' are on display to remind each of us of the importance of real values, real love, and living for 'what is', not, what 'should be'.
0380804557|4.0|STARDUST might be classified as Gaiman's nod to Lord Dunsany's THE KING OF ELFLAND'S DAUGHTER, as it certainly follows in that tradition, and does make reference to it as well.<br /><br />I think Gaiman has done better, however, especially in his SANDMAN series. Nonetheless, STARDUST is a good read and certainly worth your time.

They are the most excellent comfort food, and can please the most ardent omnivore.<br /><br />The recipes in this book are sure to please and are very adaptable; I always improvise (based on the ingredients I have on hand, as well as my whims) and the cupcakes always turn out wonderfully well--even in my 1950s Waterman gas range, lacking both a pilot light and a thermostat.<br /><br />This is my desert-island cookbook; sure, it might be limited in range, but I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.

B00007J36V|5.0|One of the great things about Amazon.com is this: if you buy alot of records from them, the \\"Recommended for You\\" page turns up some hidden gold from time to time.  When I started exploring lesser-known bands of the psychedelic era and making alot of purchases, lo and behold, this album popped up on the list.  Knowing nothing about the band other than my attraction to the album cover's resemblance to \\"American Gothic\\", I bought this record.<br /><br />Listening to the first 10 seconds of this record was an experience I have very rarely had in my life.  Usually, I can tell right away how a record is likely to sound, even if I know nothing about the band.  But listening to the first moments of this, I seriously had no idea what to expect from this record.  Growing up listening to the \\"classic rock\\" radio stations in the early 90's, and spending a good half-dozen years as a Jethro Tull fanboy, I certainly was familiar with folk-rock even if I didn't know it.  But this record was totally \\"off the reservation\\" for me from the get-go.<br /><br />From the opening guitar line of \\"Genesis Hall\\", it is clear that this is going to be a record unlike anything you've heard.  The song blends elements of jazz, folk and rock into a disturbing lamentation about the inevitable passage of time.  The third track, \\"Autopsy\\", has much of the same slightly-askew feel to it, and features vocalist Sandy Denny at her best.<br /><br />The remainder of the album features some Dylan outtakes, another Dylan song from the then-unreleased Basement Tapes, and another Sandy Denny feature \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\"  Jefferson Airplane also seems to be an influence on the vocals.  Looking ahead, Fairport's arrangement of the traditional \\"A Sailor's Life\\" fortells the sound of their follow-up record \\"Liege and Lief\\" and the ultimate direction of the band as an essential part of the folk-rock scene.<br /><br />If not for \\"Genesis Hall\\" and \\"Autopsy\\", I'd rate this a 3-4 star album.  But those two tracks easily bump this up to 5-stars.  Production value on this CD is also a strength, the sound of the record sounds very modern in most respects.tracks easily bump this up to 5-stars.

B000I5X81A|3.0|(2.5 stars) <br />Whether you love this CD or not depends on whether you think JJ Cale is a master of zen-like minimalism, or someone who sounds like he's about to fall asleep with a guitar in his hand. The photo on the back shows the two guitarists in a field with their acoustics, but this is not an accurate representation of the contents, and it's too bad, too, if they had just grabbed their acoustic guitars and rolled tape, it would have surely been more interesting than this. Essentially, this plays as a regular old JJ Cale album with Clapton along for the ride. Songwriting-wise, Cale's 11 songs are pretty rote, even rewriting \\"The Breeze\\" as an anti-war ditty. The standout song is Clapton's heartfelt \\"Three Little Girls\\" which would have sounded at home on one of his early solo albums. The rest is two pros doing their pro thing, and the traditional song forms don't leave much room for the best part; the guitar solos, which are nice, but over too quickly.

0307341542|3.0|While the mystery was obvious within the first chapter, that does not make 'Sharp Objects' any less frightening.  The some what predictable gothic plot still kept me turning the pages and left me chilled.   Flynn evokes an old-school style horror a la V.C. Andrews--the real V.C. Andrews of 'Flowers in the Attic' and 'My Sweet Audrina.' I, like Amma and Camille felt like Blue beard's wife, I knew what was coming, yet I could not bring myself to put the book down. <br /> <br />My favorite part of the book was the commedy of manners aspect where Camille mocks the behavior of her fellow 'Wind Gapians.' I found these passages to be far sharper than the mystery itself. To this effect, 'Sharp Objects' reminds me of Donna Tart's novel 'The Little Friend.' In 'The Little Friend,' Missouri girl Harriet is determined to discover who was responsible for her older brother's horrific death and uncovers some family secrets in the process. As in 'Sharp Objects' the mystery dulls admist the hilariously sharp social commentary. <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I love how all the kiddies think this band is so original and fresh and oh so mysterious.Ha ha! Maybe if i'd been glued to Empty V absorbing their teen pap and commercial hippity hop crap and emo puke punk pap core all day and a vid by this mall core goth wanna be band came on I'd think I was, but fortunately for myself, that's not the case. Take off your training wheels brats and go find some music with real power. I saw one post on here where the idiot said those who don't like this band are tone deaf(what, are Evanescence the only band in this goth oriented genre (rolls eyes) with a female singer? How many bands in the goth dark/wave etc. genres have you heard to make that assumption,clown? People scared of dark music and scary poems ha ha.I certainly don't find Evanescence dark or scary at all. She does try hard, but I can understand you teeny boppers being so enraptured with her because you are largely uninformed and I really have to wonder what other dark oriented bands you have heard so far but I can sure guess. Let's see La Cuna Coil, Within Temptation ,Nightwish? Putting Amy Lee on the level of a opera soprano makes me chuckle as well. Diamanda Galas would easily devour her, years of experience and well ahead of her in vocal use and invention. I don't think the idiot reviewer knows any dark music much if he uses this band as criteria to judge dark music oriented bands.Get out of the mall and go check out some Swans albums like Greed/Holy Money for example or The Great Annihilator album, for example. The female vocalist of the group Jarboe, was doing this schtick years before little Amy came along. Amy isn't the first or the most original thing I've ever heard doing this kinda music. The Gathering was doing this years before too. All I ever hear is kids comparing Evanescence with La Cuna Coil and Nightwish and that other crap, which tells me they don't know much about what they're talking about to make such pronouncements.If it wasn't for bands like Dead CanDance in the first place, EVANUISANCE wouldn't be around. I posted two stars for the laugh factor.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Why the newest adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice' fails in its attempt to accurately portray Jane Austen's beloved novel. <br /> The most famous of Jane Austen's works, 'Pride and Prejudice,' was first published in 1813 and still remains a favorite among many with a love for good literature and well written romance. Ever since movies become popular, companies have tried to produce films that bring Austen's, (and other famous authors') books to life. We enjoy seeing character burst forth from black and white pages into vivid, realistic people thanks to actors and actresses that portray them. Yet, while viewing Focus Feature's 2005 adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice,\\" I have come to the conclusion that were Jane Austen alive today, she -and other respectable women of the 19th century- would be horrified at the atrocious misrepresentation of Austen's characters. <br /> The most obvious change is that of the book's heroine, Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Bennet. The first difference that I noticed was her lack of respect for authority. This is first apparent after her refusal of Mr. Collins, when she angrily tells her parents, \\"I won't marry him, you cannot make me!\\" and runs out of the house. Also, in the conversation that takes place between Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam during a Sunday morning sermon, and afterwards, when her mother asks about Lady Catherine de Bourge, Elizabeth screams, \\"For once in you're life, leave me alone!\\" Jane Austen never allows Elizabeth to display such a lack of respect and self-control in the novel. The movie also fails to represent Lizzie's complete trust and affection for her sister, Jane. She denies even hearing of Mr. Bingley during her stay with the newlywed Collins, and does not tell Jane of Darcy's proposal. In Austen's book, the two sisters always confided in each other. <br /> The changes made in Mr. Darcy's character are equally disturbing. He appears so emotionless and shows almost no change in expression when he speaks that one wonders if he feels anything at all. Jane Austen's Darcy was undoubtedly stern and proud, but the dull manner in which Matthew McFayden expresses -or fails to express- himself is very tiresome, indeed.  <br />Furthermore, in Austen's novel Mrs. Bennet is presented as motherly, and often loud and embarrassing; making inappropriate remarks at all the wrong times. In the movie, she goes beyond humiliating and well into vulgar as she dangles her legs off a table she's sitting on during the ball, and sloshes her dessert on an unsuspecting young man.  <br /> The whole film is filled with frustrating errors. You're extremely fortunate if you can determine which girl is Lydia and which is Kitty before the dreadful elopement with Mr. Wickham. Everyone listens to conversations behind doors and constantly talk over one another. Mr. Bennet always appears to be half drunk, Lizzie giggles after almost every sentence no matter the gravity of the situation which greatly downplays the drama, Lady Catherine arrives at the Bennet's to admonish Elizabeth in the middle of the night when all civil folk are asleep, and Kitty and Lydia wear pig-tails to a ball. The dialogue is so rushed that it leaves you with a feeling of something missing. If you can even catch what the characters said in the first place. If the movie makers were so short on time, they should have foregone the nauseating scene with Mr. Darcy's collection of naked statues which was a completely unnecessary addition.  <br /> Even in the wardrobe department, the movie went wrong. Mr. Darcy proposes for the second and last time to Elizabeth while they are both in their bed clothes. An idea which would have been scandalous to anyone living in Jane Austen's time period. Caroline Bingley is not even properly dressed at the Netherfield ball. She is shown in a plain, sleeveless gown with very thin straps in a time when lace was all the rage and long sleeves the newest fashion in London. Miss Bingley with her love of pomp and display of social status would never have worm a gown such as the one she wears in the movie. In the film, Caroline Bingley was about 200 years ahead of herself in fashion.  <br /> I could continue to describe the atrocities of the movie until there was enough to fill a book, but I will end my comparison by saying, that Focus Features does no credit to Jane Austen's wonderful romance in their ridiculous movie. If you want to watch a film that historically and book-wise does justice to Jane Austen, stick to the A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle who do a marvelous job!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Patton is an Academy Award-winning WWII epic that not only holds up exceptionally well after 35 years but also remains the gold standard for  Hollywood biopics. The reason: George C. Scott. The supporting performances are outstanding, as is the Franklin Shaffner direction, the North Africa and Europe locations, the lavish production, the Jerry Goldsmith music and especially the crackling script by Edmund North and Francis Coppola (pre-Godfather). Scott's performance is simply larger than life. The film has been criticized for glorifying Patton -- and glorifying war -- and that's a fair assessment. But I view it more as a biography than a war film. Scott's Patton is not sympathetic -- he's vain, self-absorbed, overbearing, profane, brilliant and part madman.  His perfomance is riveting. Plus, this DVD has some special features that give you a better sense of the real Patton and help gain insight into the film that previously wasn't available of VHS or earlier DVD versions.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|\\"The lake house\\", directed by Alejandro Agresti, is not a film for everybody. If you want to enjoy it, you must forget about logic, and be ready to overlook quite a few inconsistencies in the plot. Provided that you do exactly that, you will enjoy an engaging and thoroughly delightful romantic movie that will leave a smile on your face.<br /><br />From my point of view, the main theme of \\"The lake house\\" is the existence of a soulmate for everybody, and whether we are ready (and able) to wait in order to meet the person that completes us. Kate (Sandra Bullock), who along with Alex is one of the two main characters of this movie, asks herself the question everybody has asked himself at least once, \\"What if you live your life and no one is waiting?\\". I suppose the only valid answer is to have hope, and go on searching.<br /><br />But I digress... I would like to point out that for Kate and Alex (Keanu Reeves), the problem of meeting their other half is even more complicated than for us. You don't believe me? You can't conceive of someone with more problems than you in your search of the \\"right\\" person? Well, you should take into account  that Alex Wyler and Kate Forster have our same problems, but also need to struggle with the fact that they live at the same place, in different years. And yes, you read that well, but please remember you need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of this film, if you want to enjoy it.<br /><br />The way in which Alex and Kate get in contact with each other, and fall in love, is strange, and whimsical. It doesn't make sense, but... when did logic become an obligation? \\"The lake house\\" is a magical movie that entertains, and can completely charm the right spectator. Are you that person? Are you interested in their story, and on whether they will overcome the obstacles before them in order to be together? If that is the case, just rent or buy this movie.<br /><br />All in all, I can say I really liked \\"The lake house\\", and I highly recommend it to those that like romantic films, and don't feel uncomfortable when fiction doesn't follow reality closely. This movie is not for everybody, but if you know what you are getting into and still decide to go ahead and watch, you will love it.<br /><br />Belen Alcathighly recommend it to those that like romantic films, and don't feel uncomfortable when fiction doesn't follow reality closely.

B000FTWB7G|3.0|After their last album, which I really enjoyed, I was hoping and looking forward to some more excellent hard music and wildly good vocals. It was with some sense of disappointment that \\"Open Door\\" was not all that different to the previous CD.<br /><br />The subject matter of the songs have changed, covering a darker range of topics linked to life as people experience it. This promised a range and development of their style that just seemed to miss out.<br /><br />The vocals, without doubt, are still the same rich and full voice that fans would have become used to from the last CD. The music has changed in some small ways, though it is still very much recognisable from the last CD as well.<br /><br />While I like Evanescence, and love the voice, I was not all that impressed with \\"Open Door\\". It just struck me as more of the same, albeit with a wider range of subject material thrown in.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|Rush's 1993 COUNTERPARTS heralds the style that they have continued with ever since. While the previous two albums had mainly banished their 1980s synth-driven sound, the music continued to be fairly light and airy. COUNTERPARTS brings in a much harder and grittier approach.<br /><br />The playing styles of all three members grew noticeably in the making of this album. As synths had become much less important in the band's sound, there was more room for guitar. Alex Lifeson took advantage of this opening we find strong guitar-lead moments for the first time since GRACE UNDER PRESSURE. Gedy Lee's bass finally reaches a suitable intimacy and equilibrium with the guitar. Peart's percussion technique began to highlight his interest in jazz and swing styles and also picked up, of all things, features of shoegazing drumming from bands like Lush. It is thrilling indeed to hear Rush return to right-out rocking, but pensive moments are elegantly interwoven into each song. In \\"Double Agent\\", the band uses the novelty of a narrator speaking between each scene, while \\"Cut to the Chase\\" interrupts its wide aural assault with one of Lifeson's best solos. There's even another instrumental here, \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\".<br /><br />While a strong album, COUNTERPARTS is by no means flawless. Peart's lyrics hit the extremes of both brutal sexism in \\"Cold Fire\\", claiming that women are responsible for lack of communication in relationships, and a ridiculous try at seeming tolerant and sensitive in \\"Nobody's Hero\\", mourning a gay friend. And \\"The Speed of Love\\" is a weak effort in all respects. While I think VAPOR TRAILS has the strong work of all their recent efforts, it is undone by its poor recording, and the clear production of COUNTERPARTS along with a much harder sound than 1980s Rush makes it a very successful release.

B000EJ9MTW|3.0|This disc sounds like a tribute to all their '70's influences. Without sounding mean, this album sounded like a watered down version of the real thing. Slick, but no new depths. Wolfmother comes off sounding more Black Sabbath then anything else, with a bit of Led Zeppelin and a small sprinkle of Deep Purple. Perhaps more of the Purple influence would have helped; the band lacks musical dexterity. It's sad that today's rock stars sound like clones of heroes past. But there's still time. At least this is one of the better rock albums from a new band in a long time.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|After seeing the Las Vegas Spectacular and purchasing the Original 1986 soundtrack, I was so ready to see this lavish film production.    Gerard Butler is the sexiest Phantom I've seen and I have always liked the Raoul character.    Emily Rossum is beautiful and very talented - she looked and sang like an angel.  Sarah Brightman is a tough act to follow, but Ms. Rossum, only in her teens when the film was made, did a superb job of portraying a sensitive and romantic Christine.    Minnie Driver is delightful as the Diva Carlotta.    I actually liked the final scene where Raoul visits Christine's grave with the monkey music box. The stage production left me wondering a few things that the ending resolved.    This DVD comes with some nice extras too!    I strongly recommend it for all Phantom fans.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|This dynamic duo brought hope to the 80's that individuality was still alive and creative life can emerge beyond synthesizers and spandex.

I dont know, but its a must have for those of us who survived the 80's without skads of pictures of ourselves with big band hair or garbed up like Madonna. Bless you Annie and Dave...

B000002UAO|4.0|As many know, \\"Rubber Soul\\" was a big turning point for the Beatles and will always be remembered. It was also the first of the albums where they did not take advice from the producers, and the results were pretty good! Although their best works were still behind them (\\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey Road,\\") this was quite good. There is a number of hits and it shows part of the diverse creativity of the group. <br /> <br />Some of the works here are just gorgeous, like the Greek-influenced \\"Michelle\\" and the melodic \\"Girl.\\" There are lots of catchy songs throughout this record. And then, possibly the greatest track here is \\"Nowhere Man,\\" an unpretentious commentary of someone who's not yet viewed as a major asset. The song's melody and message make it what it is. Yes, there's a bigger folk-rock influence like in \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" but that's actually something they did quite well. Other great songs include \\"You Won't See Me\\" and \\"The Word,\\" which are others that you'll sing along with and not get tired of. <br />The only track on here that I did not like was Ringo's \\"What Goes On.\\" He was a good enough drummer, but I always felt that a lot of the weakest Beatles songs were the ones he sang on. I guess it's also a bit too country for my taste, and I don't really like his voice. Maybe that's just my problem, though. <br /> <br />Overall though, \\"Rubber Soul\\" is an excellent album that will still connect with people from now, even. And people like them 'cos the music's great, not because they \\"have to\\" like it. And you don't, but you're at less of a loss if you do.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|I don't entirely disagree with the good reviews.  This movie has 2 good points:  Kate is definitely very easy on the eyes and the fight scenes and gadgets are lavishly ornate.<br /><br />However, the opening, with the medieval fight in the snow, shows how the movie is going to play out -- like a music video.  The knights are all equipped 100% alike, with shiny new armor & weapons.  The snow looks like it was just unpacked from some crates of prop supplies.  Underworld's pretty, and violent, but there is no grit, no soul, no real guts and definitely no sense of immediacy or danger.<br /><br />Some reviewer complained about snob critics.  Fair enough, you shouldn't expect great philosophy or Oscars out of a vampire/werewolf hybrid.  But you might expect to be interested, scared, or even grossed out.  Doesn't happen here:  it's too clean.  Not even a real horror flick.  It has a somewhat complicated plot that ultimately means little but backstory filler to the fight scenes.  I certainly didn't care who was going to live or die.<br /><br />Contrast that with Dog Soldiers, a recent low-budget werewolf movie.  Dog Soldiers beats it hands and claws tied down.  So does Ginger Snaps, as well as Wolfen, Howling I and other older flicks.  Even Blade I, which is similar in nature, is edgier and less pretentious.
1896597890|4.0|I think Delisle's artwork is great, very compact and minimal, yet suggesting a lot. The interiors of vast, empty buildings and the exteriors of failed construction projects are wonderful. I read the book in one sitting, and it does give a solid sense of what it's like to be in North Korea as a foreigner.  <br /> <br />However, I have to agree with a reviewer below that there's something superficial about the book's overall portrait of this shutdown, closed-up society. It's true that as Delisle points out, the country bears stark similarities to Orwell's 1984, but that's a rather obvious comparison to make. More disturbingly, this comparison leads to an overly simple contrast throughout the book between the benign goodness of Western capitalism and the stifling evil of North Korean communism--this contrast remains too simple, too black and white.  <br /> <br />Also, we've all heard many times that the people there are expected to act like robots, and yes, the fears they feel daily are real and horrifying. But the people there ARE people, not robots. The glimpses of humanity that Delisle provides beneath the seemingly robotic surfaces of the people he met there are too few and far between. At the same time, the voracious, gobbling, planet-threatening consumerism of most Westerners gets a free pass.  <br /> <br />For a better view of the humanity under the surface of Pyongyang, I suggest Pieter Fleury's recent film, North Korea: A Day in the Life. Like Delisle, Fleury was severely restricted in what he could see (and thus film), but he tries much harder to understand what he's allowed to see, rather than merely letting it confirm his preconceptions.

B0000021S9|4.0|...between CHICAGO AT CARNEGIE HALL and LIVE IN JAPAN, I'd have to pick the former; it covers more ground and is a more essential part of their catalog. I don't agree with the critics who say this album is overwhelmingly better than CARNEGIE. Still, LIVE IN JAPAN will definitely be of interest to any fan of the original Chicago.  When I first got this album as a 2-LP Japanese import, I thought it was the most beautiful album package I had ever seen, right down to the physical LPs. (I had never before seen such lengthy LP sides -- all but Side 3 were over 26 minutes, with Side 1 running over 28 minutes -- and that just added to the overall sense that this was a quality-made product.) To say the CD package doesn't do justice is an understatement.  The original Chicago is a fun band to hear live. Every member gets their moment in the spotlight, which is especially cool with a band this size. (Contrast that with all the music videos, etc., where it's all about the lead singer and everyone else is almost anonymous.) It's fun to hear them have a great time onstage, cheering each other on and introducing each other to the audience.  LIVE IN JAPAN was an oddity in Chicago's catalog -- a Japan-only live album, not released in the U.S. until many years later. Was it meant to replace CARNEGIE in Japan or be a companion album? Hard to tell.  Anyway, as far as the music goes: There are a few songs from CHICAGO V, plus the then previously unreleased &#34;Mississippi Delta City Blues&#34; which would finally appear in its definitive version on CHICAGO XI. (Terry Kath's vocal here is really sloppy, so I'm glad this didn't end up being the only released version of the song.)  Everything else is a repeat from CARNEGIE, and some of the alternate live versions justify their existence better than others. This version of CARNEGIE's one new song, &#34;A Song For Richard And His Friends&#34; (with Robert Lamm actually mentioning the CARNEGIE album in the intro), is unnecessary; it's missing the beginning of the song, yet still manages to be longer than the original. (And what was the point of the extended &#34;free-form guitar&#34; passages anyway??) &#34;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&#34; and its &#34;Free Form Intro&#34; aren't needed alongside the CARNEGIE versions either (although the opening joke, I think by James Pankow, makes this worth it). There are two songs in Japanese, which makes for an interesting, but not really worthwhile, twist. (I wonder how the Japanese translators, who had co-credits on these songs on the original LP version, feel about their names being omitted from the CD version?) But the &#34;Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon&#34; is better here than on CARNEGIE, and the 7-1/2 minute version (not counting audience noise) of &#34;25 or 6 to 4&#34; is killer.  Most interesting is &#34;I'm A Man&#34;; for its first 3 minutes it's the song as we know it (with Chicago's incorrect reading of the original lyrics, as always!); then there's 3 minutes of a bass guitar-led jam (the ONLY bass solo in Chicago's entire catalog) which is my favorite part of the album; finally there's a 5-minute drum solo which is NOT the &#34;I'm A Man&#34; drum solo but actually an extended (and unlisted) &#34;Motorboat To Mars&#34;, complete with segue into &#34;Free&#34;.  (Bonus trivia: In &#34;Beginnings&#34; here, Robert Lamm inserts some random lines; one of these -- &#34;intensity is the key&#34; -- was later built into a song, &#34;Intensity,&#34; from his 2003 solo album &#34;Subtlety & Passion.&#34; This song also featured a quick collage of old Terry Kath guitar solos.)  To sum up:  Not a replacement for (or improvement on) CARNEGIE, but definitely worth seeking out for the Chicago fan.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Listening to this album I realized that Britney is a better singer than a lot of people give her credit for, but I don't think SHE has figured that out yet.  She needs to start singing from her gut and soul instead of constricting her throat.  She has been a studio \\"product\\" and papparazzi target for too long. I hope she doesn't try to rush out a comeback album and that she gets a fair shake from the record execs on her next project.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I have listened to their music for years. I didn't like their last album as much as I did any of their previous... including Fungus Amongus.  The point being... I couldn't really put my finger on why I didn't like the last one as much as any other.<br /><br />You like different groups because of different things.  With some you like the music, some you like the words, some transport you to a different time, and some just make you smile or laugh.  They pull emotion out of you that many others cannot manage to come close to even festering.<br /><br />To me Incubus has always been about their words.  I mean... I love the music, beat, or riff... however you want to put it.  The thing is that I originally got hooked because of their words, passion, and utmost honesty.<br /><br />This album really wraps up their past and present.  It is a mix of all of the sounds they had through the years.<br /><br />I will be at one of their next concerts, in the pit, throwing someone over the first row of seats!  (O:
B000GFLE86|4.0|You would'nt think if you see her perform that the frail figure on stage is the owner of this extraordinary voice. <br />Her rendering, alongside with K. D. Lang, of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" is one of the most beuatiful songs that I've heard in years. A real Christmas classic. <br />And the melancholy that exuberates from Leonard Cohen's \\"Blue Alert\\" makes the original seem bleak. <br />This is the ideal album to listen to after a hard day's of work. You just lay back and don't want anyone or anything disturb the tender caress of Peyroux' voice. Or, imagine a hot summer's night and you just want to cool down. Pur yourself a drink, put this record on and let if flow...  <br />A minor note is her adaptation of Tom Waits' \\"The heart of saturday night\\". Strangely enough it doen'nt capture the same atmosphere as the original. <br />Of her own songs \\"I'm all right\\" and \\"A little bit\\" stand out. <br />Larry Klein should be credited for this fine production. Indeed, the world may not be perfect, but half of it seems feasible listening to this album.....
B000H1QYXY|4.0|Note: This review is based on the UK release of \\"Twenty Five.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />I'm a HUGE fan of George Michael and although his albums of late have been a bit lackluster, this \\"Best of\\" album is worth a listen. \\"Twenty Five\\" represents his entire carrer - from his days as the better half of WHAM!, to the colorful events of a few years ago, to his most recent musical contributions. The songs he's chosen are pretty much what you'd expect with a couple of notable omissions.  <br /> <br />The following are all of the (major) albums George has made to date, with the tracks used on \\"Twenty Five\\" listed below. (Tracks with a - are on both the Standard and Deluxe releases while those with a * are on the Deluxe release only):  <br /> <br />\\"Fantastic\\" (WHAM!):  <br />(nothing)  <br /> <br />\\"Make it Big!\\" (WHAM!):  <br />-Everything She Wants  <br />-Wake Me Up Before You Go Go  <br />-Freedom  <br />-Careless Whisper  <br />*If You Were There  <br /> <br />\\"Music From the Edge of Heaven\\" (WHAM!):  <br />-A Different Corner  <br />-Last Christmas  <br /> <br />\\"Faith:\\"  <br />-Faith  <br />-Father Figure  <br />-One More Try  <br /> <br />\\"Listen Without Prejudice:\\"  <br />-Freedom '90  <br />-Praying for Time  <br /> <br />\\"Five Live\\" (live Freddie Mercury tribute):  <br />(nothing)  <br /> <br />\\"Older:\\"  <br />-Fastlove  <br />-Spinning the Wheel  <br />-Jesus to a Child  <br />-Older  <br />-You Have Been Loved  <br /> <br />\\"Ladies and Gentlemen:\\"  <br />-Too Funky  <br />-Outside  <br />-As (not on the US release of Ladies and Gentlemen)  <br />-Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me (with Elton John)  <br />*Fantasy (not on the US release of Ladies and Gentlemen)  <br /> <br />\\"Songs From the Last Century:\\"  <br />*Roxeanne  <br />*My Baby Just Cares for Me  <br /> <br />\\"Patience:\\"  <br />-Freeek  <br />-Shoot the Dog (not on the US release of Patience)  <br />-Amazing  <br />-Flawless (Go to the City)  <br />-Round Here  <br />-John and Elvis Are Dead  <br />*Precious Box  <br />*Cars and Trains  <br />*Patience  <br />*My Mother Had a Brother  <br />*American Angel  <br />*Please Send Me Someone to Love  <br />*Through  <br /> <br />New Tracks:  <br />-An Easier Affair  <br />-Heal the Pain (duet with Paul McCartney)  <br />-This is Not Real Love (with Mutya)  <br />*Understand  <br />*You Know That I Want to  <br />*Safe  <br />*Brother Can You Spare a Dime? (live)  <br /> <br />There are several tracks that should be here but aren't: From \\"Faith,\\" I'd include 'I Want Your Sex (Parts 1 & 2),' 'Monkey,' and 'Kissing a Fool.' 'The Strangest Thing' and 'Star People' from \\"Older\\" should also have been included. And 'I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)' is my favorite duet George has performed (with Aretha Franklin).  <br /> <br /> <br />BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT is the new stuff, right? Well, as I said in the opening, I feel George's recent music isn't as good as his older compositions. This generally holds true for the new tracks on \\"Twenty Five.\\" The one exception is \\"An Easier Affair.\\" It'll get you dancing and smiling but feels like a genuinely new direction for his music. It's fantastic. The rest of the new tracks are needlessly re-hashed songs or so-so new compositions.  <br /> <br />Another thing you'll likely be curious about is the Standard VS. Deluxe versions of this album. In my opinion, the Deluxe version is not substantially better than the Standard. The third exclusive disc is mostly made up of tracks from 'Patience' although it does have some (so-so) new songs. You'll probably have to listen for yourself, but I was not especially impressed.  <br /> <br /> <br />Conclusion: A few of the track selections (and omissions) on this album are unfortunate, but an amazing career provides some of the great pop music. This \\"Best of\\" album even delivers a new classic tune. Pick it up and if you haven't, explore George's \\"Faith\\" and \\"Older\\" albums.
B00005LANG|5.0|From personal experience, I can say that if you are trying to get into Bob Marley, start with this album!  Let me start out with this: A lot of people(and I used to be one of them) say that all of Bob's songs sound the same.  I have learned, from actually listening to his songs thoroughly, that that is an ignorant statement.  Yes, the guitar does sound the same on 98% of the songs.  But I have come to learn that the guitar in Reggae is just like the drums are in others genres of music; it keeps the beat.  If it didn't sound like it does in every song, then it WOULDN'T be Reggae.  The appreciation comes when you listen to how the song is built up around the guitar part; the horns, the keys/piano, and especially the BASS.   <br />   Now that I've said my part, I'll talk about the album.  This is, from start to finish, an excellent album.  If I were to be completely honest, it took a long time for it to grow on me.  But once it did, it became my favorite Bob album.  It is so emotional, and it contains my second favorite Bob song \\"Waiting in Vain.\\"  This album is also special because I believe that this was the first recording on which Marley knew he had cancer and was dying.  To make music with this much passion and make your 5 best albums(Exodus-Confrontation) AFTER you know that you have cancer deserves a hell of a lot of admiration if you ask me.  Anyway, don't take my word for it, buy this album.  If you don't like this one, chances are you won't really like any other Bob Marley.  But if you do like this, every recording after this one is also excellent.  This is not to say that all the pre-Exodus albums aren't good, but they are very different than this one.   <br />   In short, if you are trying to get to know Bob Marley's music, you should: <br />   1)Know how to appreciate Reggae music <br />   2)Start with this album, and if you like it, then <br />   3)Buy any/all albums AFTER this one (Kaya-Confrontation) <br />   4)Then move on to the ealier albums
B000002HJR|5.0|This is monumental southern metal from a very talented group, combining their talents for, well, apparently...fun! What an excellent reason.<br /><br />The leviathan band is comprised of Pepper Keenan (COC), Phil Anselmo (Pantera), Jimmy Bower (Eyehategod) and Kirk Windstein (Crowbar), so something of a who's-who of southern metal combining for the love of music. \\"NOLA\\" is the first offering from this outstanding group, and what an album it is.<br /><br />\\"Temptation's Wings\\" kicks the album off in style, instantly setting the scene with its big idiosyncratic Keenan riffs, no-nonsense drumming and of course Anselmo's distinctive and powerful vocals. The song is a strong opening statement, and one that's continued with one of my album picks \\"Lifer\\", which showcases the redeeming skill of this band - their ability to write good song structures. The song eases its way through varying sections, altering in pace, style and aggression, leading to its ultimate climax of a rolling, sluggish Keenan riff. Solid tracks such as \\"Pillars of Eternity\\", \\"Rehab\\" and \\"Hail The Leaf\\" (which shows another passion of the band) continue the flow and style without a moment of weakness.<br /><br />The second half of the album is what really does it for me though. \\"Eyes of the South\\" simply took my face off the first time I heard it, starting with a quiet and brooding bass line, slowly and patiently the whole band comes in with a flooring main riff. Combine this with some typical Anselmo aggression (with the fist-wielding yell of `god daaaaaam' when the main riff comes in) and an excellent outro riff that the band plays for a couple of minutes straight (which may seem like a long time, but with riffs this good, time flies), this is Down in full flight. The band is also slightly more experimental in the second part of the album, with songs such as \\"Jail\\" and to an extent \\"Stone the Crows\\" acting as subtle and needed breaks from the slogging, relentless attack of the previous songs.<br /><br />All of this leads to \\"Bury Me In Smoke\\", which I think deserves its own little paragraph. This song is THE Down song. If you need proof that this band kicks the s*** out of 90% of metal acts out there, listen to this song. Starting with an infectious dirgy riff, the band slow things down with a chugging verse section and Anselmo singing in his loveable desperate style. Combine this with an excellent chorus, which sees the opening riff to good use and the powerful line of `when I die / bury me in smoke' you have a great song. But the band are not content with just great, they want more, and they deliver more by creating one of the biggest, heaviest, head-banging inducing riffs I have ever heard. Add some slick little solos from Keenan and you have one of the best metal songs ever, and definitely metal album closers of all time. This song is perfection.<br /><br />And for that matter, this album is almost perfection. Never before have I heard such a thing from a supergroup. The understanding of each other's instruments and capabilities seems perfect, the balance and energy they fuse rivals, and maybe even betters, anything any of the members have done before. This is a modern classic in every sense of the word.In Smoke\\", which I think deserves its own little paragraph. This song is THE Down song.

0486236951|5.0|I love this book for the designs!  If you are looking for White Work eye candy you will be disappointed it has no photographs of white work other than the front cover.  This is a simple book and if you look at the price it reflects that as well.  Still it is a wonderful book just for the designs alone, which can be used with any embroidery not just in white work.  I enjoyed reading about the history and how stitches are used for white work.  The only thing that really makes white work any different is that it is done in all white thread on white fabric and when you work in 1 color you need to use different stitches to create texture and make your embroidery interesting. <br />The author suggests stitches for use with the patterns but they are only recommendations.  I do wish there was a few examples to \\"see\\" what has been explained but that is not needed in order to use the patterns or to try creating your own white work. <br />Overall for the price this book is worth it for the patterns and a little bit of white work history and ideas.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Amazing how they compliment each other. Honestly, some of the weenie Chicago songs were okay...But man, EW and Fire really brought life to this concert. Loved the hot version of FREE and SHINING STAR, actually, just a great concert. Almost 3 hours!

B0002TKFRM|4.0|Great value.  Great performances.  On my krell sacd player, I found small differences between the SACD layer and the regular.  The recordings are outstanding.  Consider the price and that this is a 2 lp set, this is a deal.
B0000AI45P|5.0|I hadn't heard anything about this band before I began to notice Television being repeatedly mentioned as an influence for a variety of other bands; U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Strokes, The Killers, etc. I figured that there was probably something good about them if so many other bands liked them, so I listened to clips of a couple of Television's songs online and then I bought their first album, \\"Marquee Moon\\". <br /> <br /> For originally being only eight tracks (though this edition has an extra song, alternate versions, and an instrumental), \\"Marquee Moon\\" manages to pack a lot of complexity into a short period of listening time. Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine have an impressive command over their instruments; the guitar. Their style of playing intertwines both lead guitar and rhythm guitar in such a way that it's almost hard to separate the one from the other! The bass is strong, the drums form a good backbeat, Verlaine's poetic style of lyrics and unusual delivery of vocals fit the instrumentation well...what's not to like about this band?! <br /> <br /> It's hard to pick favorite tracks, because every song on the album is fantastic. \\"See No Evil\\", \\"Friction\\", and \\"Torn Curtain\\" are tracks I particularly like. A few of the songs are a bit lengthy (the title track, \\"Marquee Moon\\", is 10 minutes and 47 seconds), but the whole album flows from song to song so well, it doesn't really seem to matter. It's a brilliant classic! <br /> <br /> I've never heard anything else like it.
B000L43AN4|5.0|I've been listening to Tom Waits since I was just a little kid, and he is probably my favorite songwriter. The first album I heard was \\"Heartattack and Vine,\\" so that one still holds a special place in my heart alongside \\"One From The Heart\\" and \\"Swordfishtrombone\\". \\"Orphans\\" is quickly becoming my all time favorite Waits album. \\"Orphans\\" is easily one of the best albums ever released. If you are a Waits fan, you will love \\"Orphans,\\" and if you're not a Waits fan yet, \\"Orphans\\" will probably convert you.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I heard track 2 of this CD, \\"You are Loved,\\" on the canned music at my job, and knew there had to be another Josh Groben CD out there. His is the voice I would want to hear if I were on the \\"Titanic,\\" going down for the final time. What an amazing sound. unmistakable, in this pre-packaged world. and, praise God, 8 of the songs are in English. Great as the voice is, I always feel ripped off if too many of the songs are in a language I can't understand. One can only fantasize about what he could do with old classics like \\"Because,\\" \\"The Holy City,\\" \\"Roses of Picardy,\\" and others immortalized by the great tenors of another age. He is the modern MacCormack, and that's saying a lot.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|very much similar to the successful songs from the earlier one, nothing new. but i liked it and glad to have it
B00000JBFW|5.0|I love this cd so much. I recommend that anyone who likes Deep Purple pick up a copy.
0375831002|5.0|This book is the first one I read this year, and wow, it has really set the bar! I read 2-3 books a week, in a variety of genres, and this one absolutely captivated me with charm and warmth. I have read The Diary of Ann Frank, as a little girl, and more recently Night, when Oprah featured it for her book club, but The Book Thief is far and away the best book I have ever read about Nazi Germany. I felt such a love for the characters, and the author's style is totally enthralling. He writes with such a light touch, that even a subject as grim as the Holocaust, while not in any sense ever for a moment being trivialized, is so greatly humanized. Images of children playing soccer in the streets, unaware of the evil around them, or a little girl with secrets, and a young life that has known real horror, yet still finds beauty in the world around her... Wow, I could not put it down. Absolutely lovely, and one that I will be judging every other read this year against, and remember for a long, long time. I can't wait to read his next book, and have ordered it already.
B000002KKS|5.0|Ronnie James Dio made a name for himself in Rainbow. After Ozzy was asked to leave Sabbath, Tony Iommi had a chance meeting with Dio and asked him to join the band. Heaven and Hell was the first album Black Sabbath released with Dio singing. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is Ronnie James Dio's finest work, just barely beating out Rising. Sabbath lost none of their power when Ozzy left, and the opening track, Neon Knights, shows it quickly. Children of the Sea is an excellent rocker, as is Lady Evil. The centerpiece of the album is the epic title track. It's a classic, and ends with a nice little acoustic guitar passage from Iommi that fades into the silence, and then Wishing Well smashes the silence with another great riff. Die Young is the second best song on the album. Walk Away is the only forgettable tune, and Lonely Is the Word is pretty good as well. <br /> <br />Heaven and Hell melds the heavy darkness of traditional Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio's energy. It's a classic that belongs in every rock fan's collection.
B000J103PC|3.0|At long last I finally watched this DVD last night, and I confess I am confused as to why all the huzzahs and praise for this movie. It was a bore whenever Meryl Streep wasn't on the screen. She's wonderful! But without her, this is a Lifetime movie. Realize negative reviews here don't win popularity points, but sorry, it's the truth. And am I the only one who thinks the grown-up Anne Hathaway is sorta...dull?
0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris has some great ideas in this book...along with some not so great ideas. He has some good views about the nature of belief, reason, God, and Islam; he is convincing about the nature of good and evil. When he gets into consciousness, however, he loses a star automatically, just for seeming to give enormous credit to Buddhism, another belief system that should be held to just as much skepticism as the rest of the belief systems he blasts. However, as many others, he seems to BELIEVE Buddhism is a more scientific system, when it really is not such a thing. He probably thinks it is because it is not by nature a theistic system. He even states there may be something to reincarnation! He redeems himself from these embarrassing lapses only by stating Buddhism, reincarnation, and such have to be evaluated in a scientific way in order to give proper credit to them. You would think.<br /><br />Nevertheless, his other points about the risks of faith without proof, especially in the realm of Islam and fundamental Christianity, should be read and paid attention to by the highest political authorities in every powerful nation on Earth (think G8). We cannot handle these fanatics (Muslims) with kid gloves, or allow false prophecies to become self- fulfilling ones (Christians).<br /><br />One huge irritation about the layout of the book itself is that there are 227 pages of text, but 63 pages of notes in the back of the book. I am accustomed to notes, but most of these notes could have simply been incorporated into the text rather than the superscript, as they were immediately pertinent and interesting and would have done fine as part of the text, but no, one must spend all of one's time going back and forth.<br /><br />He definitely could be an important player in a much needed new system of thought and expectation of scientific discovery, but seriously needs to lay off the Buddhism, reincarnation, and some of the consciousness stuff that will get him laughed out of the group of serious scientific writers.<br /><br />I would advise anyone liking this book for the sober parts also read THE GOD DELUSION by Richard Dawkins and LETTER TO A CHRISTIAN NATION, also by Sam Harris.<br /><br />Lest anyone think I subscribe to the elimination of free thought, I submit a statement by Thomas Paine from The Age Of Reason, a book I recommend more than any aforementioned:<br /><br />&#34;I have always strenuously supported the right of every man to his opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.<br /><br />The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason.&#34;
0743539133|5.0|Love the book.  It was well written and Richard Thomas does a great job reading it.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys history and especially the Civil War.
B00005JPDP|1.0|Perfume <br /> <br />\\"Perfume\\" tells the tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a Parisian baby born to a rather stupid mother, who, assuming him to be yet another stillbirth, literally tosses him into the gutter. He's hired by a tannery and eventually, when a down-on-his-luck perfume maker Giuseppe Baldini notices his incredible gift for scent, Grenouille sets about achieving greatness in his own peculiar manner. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with \\"Perfume\\" is that it suffers from the ultimate case of The Emperor's New Nose. There's an imperceptible line of demarcation, much like the two mountain paths recurring in the movie, that divides brilliance from dreck, and sadly, \\"Perfume\\" hitches its wagon to the latter path, and follows it through to the bitter end. <br /> <br />Performance-wise there's nothing going on we haven't seen before, the nearest thing to honest-to-god acting contained in this movie is Alan Rickman's performance as Antoine Richis, troubled father of the beautiful Laura. Sadly, his part is a very small one (as are all parts of this movie not that of its lead character) and his ridiculously over-the-top speech in the closing minutes of the picture negate any sense of affinity or empathy we might have felt for him. Something about how he's going to seep into Grenouille's pores and come shooting out his nose, or something. I'm not making this up. <br /> <br />As troubled teen Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, Ben Whishaw is a total nonstarter: he's sort of a cross between Beaker from the Muppet Show and a comatose Hannibal Lecter. His emotional range doesn't stretch past looking either A. bored, or B. slightly turned-on. But then, the screenplay must assume its fair share of the blame: Whishaw does for the most part what he can with a really turgid script. It seems someone forgot to explain to the director and screenplay writing team that this, in fact, is a talkie. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with \\"Perfume\\" is the disparity between what the overly-explicit visuals would have you believe, and what the screenplay actually tells us. Smellovision hasn't yet been invented so clearly the production design and the camerawork are designed to make us believe that we can indeed smell the many strong odours of Grenouille's Paris. It's going for a sense of lushness and full-on olfactory assault. The screenplay gives us a monotonous one-note Tale O' Woe, and it's in this glaring contrast that the essence of what could have been a stellar piece of cinema is totally and irretrievably lost. We keep searching for a mental connection with the content to match our optical connection with the visuals, and sadly, this never arrives. <br /> <br />Don't bother. \\"Perfume - Story of a Murderer\\" isn't worth your while. Check out Hugh O' Connor in \\"The Young Poisoner's Handbook\\" for a much more satisfying example of sociopathic teens, or something like \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" or \\"La Reine Margot\\" if Ye Olde France is your thing.
B000002GYI|5.0|Released in 1981, Kraftwerk put all the elements of their legendary vision of electronics into this revolutionary album whose influence is still felt today in studios throughout the world.<br /><br />By using cutting-edge electronics with sequencing, electric percussion and vocals, the band set the foundation for such genres as hip-hop and techno, while making the human performance on numerous musical instruments virtually obsolete in the studio & on stage.<br /><br />The optimism of how the computer age will be beneficial to society - Computer World - kicks off the CD. But the outlook is tempered with the naming of a variety of (in)famous government police/spy agencies who will also have vast technological means to watch over things.<br /><br />Pocket Calculator has an infectious beat. The band actually used calculator-sized devices to perform the song during the world tour to promote the album. Numbers - which features a metallic vocal - flows into Computer World 2.<br /><br />The balance of optimism based upon a universe of options at one's fingertips with questions on what it will mean to personal contact are played out in Computer Love, Home Computer and It's More Fun To Compute.<br /><br />There are few artists and releases that truly crashed down the doors of the too-often stodgy music industry. And that Computer World is still a sonic revelation 25-plus years later says it all.
0679746323|5.0|My first review of Mao has been deleted by Amazon. As have dozens of my comments, and not only that, they have given me the rating of '0' (before I simply had no ranking). I don't know if this means I am the lowest rated reviewer or not. Maybe there are others. But it is partly because of my praise of this book, and my attack against those who give this book a one-star rating.     This book is biased, it is sometimes annoyingly so, but the horrors of Mao are still horrors. The book is incredibly well researched, the bibliography is extensive. Many reviewers have pointed it out. Read this book, learn about one of the most sadistic and evil people that ever lived.     And shame on you, Amazon, for censoring readers whose views are political, yet valid reviews.    AND HERE'S THE ORIGINAL:    166 of 690 people found the following review helpful:     Dui Mao-de xin-tu lai-shuo...dui-niu-tan-qin,   January 13, 2007    I won't stop until I have 10,000 negative votes! The first review is excellently written, thoughtful, and adds comments to this discussion board. When I first came here there were about 400 positive votes and 100 or so negative, yet now there have been added some two hundred negative votes. Wow! I didn't know Mao followers were so brain-washed. The book is okay, but it is biased, and thus it loses a little, but it is well-documented, and the fact so many Mao defenders have risen up to give negative votes on this board is testament to the fact that Mao was evil. The problem is, if you criticize Mao publicly in China you go to jail. This says much. So as my pin-yin above says, \\"Talking to Mao followers is like playing violin to a cow.\\" (qin is actually an instrument unique to China...but my translation gets the point across)
B000003CM8|5.0|As you probably know by now, I love debut albums! And the year, 1969, was one of the best years ever for them. Such great first efforts by artists like Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Santana, Grand Funk Railroad, Mountain, the James Gang, Led Zeppelin, Chicago. This first album by the Allman Brothers Band, however, ranks among the best debuts of 1969, and the more I listen to it, the more it reminds me a lot of Santana's debut album from the same year, and a little bit of Aerosmith's debut a few years later. Unlike many Allman albums to come, when they started to evolve into what we now fashionably call \\"Southern Rock\\", this one combined more of the latin/funk, percussive rhythms and organ-driven, blues-wailing jams of Santana's debut album, together with the urban swagger and attitude of Aerosmith's debut album--Aerosmith and Allman's debut albums also having in common the same producer, Adrian Barber, with his raw, dusty, \\"flip-the-switch-and-let'em-bang-out-the-tunes-'til-we-get-tired-and-fade'em-out\\"-style of production. And like Aerosmith and Santana's debut albums, there's not a whole lot of songs on this first album. It's short, sweet, and to the point--and tells you all you need to know about the band at the time.  <br />Considering the fact that nearly all but two songs here were written by Gregg Allman (the rest were \\"covers\\") and that all the songs were sung by Gregg Allman, it's amazing when you realise that he was only brought into the group at the last minute! No one else in the band were writing songs at the time. Dickey Betts would write songs later, but he had just come from a \\"mostly\\" covers band called the \\"Second Coming\\". No one else was really a \\"singer\\" then, either. How fortunate they must have been for Duane Allman to think about calling his brother, Gregg, in from L.A. to play organ, sing, and write songs for the band. If not for Gregg's involvement here, this band might not have had an album, a recording contract--or even a career! <br />But atthe tender age of 21 or 22, Gregg was rather \\"world-weary\\" already, and seemed to have experienced the kind of blues that only Eric Clapton would have envied so early in life, and be able to articulate. Gregg Allman was certainly one of the first great white blues songwriters. Nearly all the songs, except for \\"Dreams\\", seem to convey some kind of anger or resentment toward women--four of the songs written by Gregg, and two written by others. It's obvious that Gregg had \\"girl trouble\\" in his life at this time, and this first Allman Brothers album was a chance for him to get it out of his system! There's only one other album mostly dedicated to trouble with women, and it's one that, ironically, Gregg's brother, Duane, would play on a year later--Derek and the Dominoes, \\"Layla\\". But Gregg Allman had a way to communicate his heartbreak in a way that Eric Clapton would never be able to duplicate, and it is his white blues singing/songwriting that reminds me of another \\"Gregg\\"--Gregg Rolie from Santana, whose passionate singing and songwriting about resentment and heartbreak over women mirrors that of Gregg Allman to a \\"tee\\". I truly believe Gregg Allman would never write better songs later than the few he did on this first Allman Brothers album, and it is only life experiences that can bring out the best in one's songwriting, and it's what he lived through at the time. <br />As for musical highlights: This is the one Allman Brothers album where every member seemed to showcase every bit of talent they had. For starters, the instrumental, \\"Don't Want You No More\\", written by Spencer Davis--now there's an obscure cover tune, if you want to show how much you know about \\"British R&B\\"! (sort of reminds me a little of Aeromsith familiarising themselves with Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\"!) My favorites, however, are the ones that you don't hear on a \\"greatest hits\\" set of the Allman Brothers Band, and those are \\"Black Hearted Woman\\" and \\"Every Hungry Woman\\"--and to a lesser degree, the studio version of \\"Whippin' Post\\" and \\"Trouble No More\\". \\"Black Hearted Woman\\" has some of the funkiest riffs ever to set sail from the twin-lead guitars of Dickey Betts and Duane Allman, and some of the best drum and percussion work ever from the team of Butch Trucks and Jaimoe Johanson, really showing their talents well on that track. I especially like the \\"echo\\" put on Gregg's vocals for dramatic effect. \\"Every Hungry Woman\\" opens with one of the few times you will ever hear \\"echo\\" or \\"reverb\\" on Duane's guitar, but follows with some more twin-guitar funk. I like the drums that open \\"Trouble No More\\"--followed, once again, by more twin-guitar funk. I'm now beginning to see how rock critics criticised this album for all the songs sounding the same! The Allman Brothers band just had a sound all their own, and much of it was the creativity and inventiveness in the sound and the riffs of the two lead guitars of Dickey and Duane played together. As for \\"Whippin' Post\\", I always thought this one had some of Berry Oakley's most unique bass guitar lines. Oakley was defintely not one to sit back and let his bass be the instrument that the drummer just flopped his sticks with! His bass was all over, in, around, and through \\"Whippin' Post\\"! <br />But what really sets the Allmans apart from all other British and American blues-based rock bands--from day one, and throughout their musical career--guitar-wise, they were never really a \\"power-chord\\"-type of band. They let their single-string leads and solos be their \\"calling card\\" in that area, and whatever else fills the sound is driven by the organ, bass, drums, and percussions. They were never even really big on guitar effects--although, there is one instance at the end of \\"Whippin' Post\\", where I believe I faintly hear the sound of a \\"wah wah\\" pedal as they close the song? Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I do think it adds some nice drama to end the song with, anyway! <br />There's a lot in thesounds of this album, effects or otherwise, that I don't believe the Allmans would ever return to much of later (there was even some Santana-like percussion and \\"timbales\\" playing by Butch Trucks!) I think this was their least \\"Southern Rock\\"-sounding album--Dickey Betts would bring more \\"countrified\\" lyrics and playing later, beginning with the album, \\"Eat A Peach\\". But that's why I like their first album best, because it doesn't \\"fit\\" the stereotypes of what people think \\"Southern Rock\\" should sound like (notice I compared this album more to Santana and Aerosmith's debut albums, than those by Lynyrd Skynyrd or Marshall Tucker). In a lot of places, the music sounds more urban and jazzy--conjuring up more the images of the dingy streets of downtown Memphis, Atlanta, and New Orleans, than those of the southern countryside. And for goodness sakes, people--PLEASE, stop comparing them to the Grateful Dead! The \\"jamming\\" by the Allman Brothers Band here, and on future releases, is far more fun, dramatic, soulful, and funky than anything the Grateful Dead would ever play! In a lot of ways, too, this was Gregg Allman's best solo album--in as far as his soul searching, and songwriting throughout. But certainly for those who don't like \\"southern rock\\"--but just good, bluesy jamming, this is the one Allman Brothers band album you must have!
0375505091|3.0|Annie's work is well known, and deeply respected for very good reason. The book is extremely well printed, with great detail and texture! To be completely honest, my family found some of the photos to be a bit graphic, and well... the book might have reached a wider audience if some other selections had been made for inclusion in the book.
1881273156|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, married or not.  There are wonderful life lessons that we all know deep down, but no one has ever organized and labled them in such a memorable hilarious way.  Excellent gift for those considering marriage.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This movie is absolutely pure genius! Not your typical slasher/horror flick. There's plenty of blood and gore, but that's not what carries the movie. The killer is brilliant and creative. It left me guessing who did it all the way to the very end, and then it will leave you with your mouth hanging open in amazement. Very satisfying suspense movie.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The classic version, as perfect as it could be. Lovely young Natalie Wood, stunning Maureen O'Hara and Edmond Gwenn is the perfect everyday Santa.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am not going to spend a lot of time writing an elaborate review of this CD...  that would be unnecessary.  I am going to sum this up in a very brief review:<br /><br />This CD is incredible.  I cannot stop listening.  I wish I spoke Italian so that the excellent Italian songs would be all the more enjoyable (if that is even possible).<br /><br />Highly recommended.  No flaws.  Enjoy.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Having never heard a Loreena McKennitt album before, I decided with some trepidation to take a chance with 'An Ancient Muse', given the quality and enthusiasm of some of the reviews posted on Amazon.com.  The recording starts low key with 'Incantation'  and builds deceptively slowly, but by the time track four came along ('The English Ladye And The Knight') I knew I was onto something special.  The juxtaposition of the ethereal vocals with traditional song structures is really incredible and this record has 'labour of love' written all over it.  Crucially, it is not over-produced and the arrangements are perfect.  It is probably the best recent example I have heard of music that combines beautiful and sparse eastern ethnic instrumentation with a western sensibility; here the emphasis is fimly derived from the the complex history of the Celtic people.  The instrumental track 'Kecharitomene' is stunning and a particular highlight for me.  It would be fantastic as part of a film score, being reminiscent of some of the great thematic work done for the highly underrated film and score for 'Kingdom Of Heaven' by Harry Gregson-Williams.  The album only gets stonger and more epic as it progresses  ('Beneath A Phrygian Sky') and culminates in the suitably melancholic 'Never-Ending Road'.  This album is a truly rare thing; both literary and emotional, which manages to combine folk and world music coherently and with real restraint and elegance.  And what a voice!  Hugely recommended.
0743298020|2.0|I found several gaps in the story which distracted me from fully enjoying 'the 13th tale'.  It seemed the author went out of her way not to give the reader any clues as to when the story took place.  Although automobiles are mentioned, it could just as well be 1890 or 1990. <br />Was the uncle/brother's body in the shed ever found?  What happened to the Missus's remains?  How did the other child arrive at the house and why did the Missus and John the Dig keep her from view?  What was Margaret's hang-up about being a twin anyway and why blame her Mother, yet have such love and respect for her Father?  The end of the book was over-the-top and magnified, for me, the flaws I found throughout.
1591391105|5.0|Super book to remind you of how important those first 90 days are on a new job (changed responsibilities) or in a new company. This has very helpful charts and chapter summaries. Nice to just jump to the index and than to a specific chapter, well formated and packed with good advice.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|Call me crazy, but I (Santa) gave all 4 of my boys one of these Nerf guns for Christmas.  I have never allowed weapons as a gift at Christmas, but Nerf wars have been a common activity in our house, and I could not resist.  My boys are ages 7-13.  They have had more fun with these guns, and I think I could have gotten away with giving them nothing but this gift.  It is actually 2 guns in one.  The scope really works once they learned how to use it.  And although it is suppose to only take the one kind of bullet, my kids have managed to use the Nerf-tag bullets with it too.  All of the grown men in the family have taken turns with the guns.  <br />The guns are made well, and have been a real hit!
0060776757|5.0|I ordered the U2 by U2 for my boyfriend.  He is a huge fan and thought it was great. I would defenitley recomend it for the U2 fan in your life. It has lots of pics and stories. As the buyer, I had no problem placing the order or with shipping.  It came within the estimated arrival time. It made a wonderful gift and I will use Amazon again in the future.  Thanks for making my online shopping experience a plesant one.
B00005B1W5|5.0|This is a must DVD for any Yanni Fan. The DVD creatively jumps between the two concerts, in Taj Mahal, India and in the Forbidden City, China. The viewer is cleverly transported between these two places throughout the DVD. The bonus material is poetically written and beautifully narrated. This DVD has an exotic flavor thanks to the music from his mesmorizing album \\"If I Could Tell You\\". Tribute gives the viewer a spiritual experience.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is simply the best series that I have seen in a long time.   <br /> <br />The creators have skilfully blended a recipe of well-known American urban legends and ghost stories with the lives of its two main characters Dean and Sam Winchester, expertly played by the tasty Jensen Ackles and equally tempting Jared Padalecki.   <br /> <br />The story tells of two brothers; raised by their father John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) after the death of their mother at the hands of a supernatural entity.  We learn that theirs was not, however, a life of comfort and safety, but rather instability and danger as their broken-hearted father, searched for the creature that killed his wife, and along the way taught his young sons the art of hunting all things evil. <br /> <br />After John disappears, it is up to the two brothers, now young men and expert hunters in their own right, to trace their missing father and continue the hunt for their mother's killer.  The younger brother, Sam, is reluctant at first, having left the `family business' to go to college, but he feels compelled to join Dean after his girlfriend dies in the same unnatural way as his mother. <br /> <br />The leading actors are a joy to behold, not only for their good looks, but also, more importantly, for their very believable portrayal of the two brothers and the relationship between them.  It was refreshing to see that the writers were not afraid to have the brothers disagree and fight sometimes and in one episode, even have them go their separate ways after an argument (only for one to come to the rescue of the other when the chips were down).   <br /> <br />The calibre of the acting is such that a simple look or expression speaks volumes and stirs the emotions; encouraging the viewer to care very much what happens to the characters (and the cliffhanger episode at the end of the season will have you pulling your hair out in frustration). <br /> <br />Mix all of that with a smidgen of humour, (always incorporated at the appropriate time so that it does not suspend the excitement and drama of the hunt) as well as the continuing story arc woven into the fabric of the individual episodes and you have yourself a winner. <br />
B000K4WPCC|1.0|First off, Laura Ramsey is not a Highschool girl and could not be confused for 18/19.  She is a young twenty something in this movie and she has the smoking hot body to prove it.  The plot was lacking, there was little to no witchcraft, and the acting from the others left one wanting.  They had a good plot base and failed to expound on it, all I can think is that the movie was cheesy to the point where I felt I had waisted my time.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Once again, Disney/Pixar hits the mark. This is a funny movie with a moral. Thougoughly enjoyable for both kids and adults.
B000GYTQU0|5.0|Thinking I would skip to the bonus tracks, I was AWESTRUCK by the FIDELITY of this 1968 rocker of a recording. I also own the regular and 30th Anniversary versions of this. The sound on this make those sound tinny by comparison.    (Note that there are even more versions of this recording available.)    Some of the bonus tracks are alternate versions, but are found on the \\"Anthology 3\\" CD. \\"Hey Jude\\" on this, is a DIFFERENT VERSION, which is  entertaining, funny, and SUPERB!    The bonus track \\"Dig It\\" is quite interesting. At 8:22 minutes long, it is much more than the 49 second version of it, found on the \\"Let It Be\\" album/CD (although the \\"Let it Be\\" version catches the gist and climax of it.) Other bonus material makes me feel like the \\"2nd Yoko Ono,\\" sitting in on the Beatles' final recording sessions.    I am hearing little things I never heard before, and this rock recording, from 1968 is still surpassing many new (rock) recordings, in terms of fidelity.    Anyway, this particular CD just sounds AWESOME!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie grabbed our attention right from the start, with its well-documented statistics and graphic illustrations of the deterioration of our planet.

Absolutely brilliant.If you are interested on cell biology it is very simple to understand for lay people.The implications and suggestions that the new science presents are mind bending and exciting.

B00005JOLI|1.0|If you like action fantasies, Eragon (the movie) has action, and it is a fantasy.<br /><br />This review goes down from there.<br /><br />Eragon (the movie) deviates in many significant ways from Eragon (the book).  From the story line, to the character interactions, to the personalities of the characters, if you have any positive thoughts about the book (and I did), you will wince, wince, wince.  And the movie mistakes!  Here a horse, there TWO horses; here no bow and arrows... now where did THEY come from!  The dragon and her rider are the fastest routes to the castle... so how exactly did Brom, on a horse, get there in the nick of time?<br /><br />Brrrr.<br /><br />With the criticism of the book of the borrowed story line and characters of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, et cetera, I was its defender.  Eragon (the book) was still entertaining and a yarn worthy of being told.  But Eragon (the movie) tried its hardest to MAKE the viewer realize the similarities between those other stories and this one (except for a couple of things... have you ever envisioned a dwarf or an elf that looked LESS like a \\"dwarf\\" or an \\"elf\\"?  And what about an evil dragonrider/king that sat around speaking softly and tried, very unsuccessfully, to appear totally ruthless?).<br /><br />My son says \\"it was terrible because it did not follow the book in the most important ways, and it was very, very cheesy.\\"  And that's from a kid who's read the book at least 6 times!<br /><br />'Nuff said.
B000F6IOBQ|4.0|Starts off with a lot of action. The movie as a whole is good. Would be better if some of the characters from the first film were left alive to be in the second film. Wait till you see Marcus!!!! He's one ugly hybrid. There are some surprises and great special effects. If you liked the first part you will enjoy this one as well.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|All you Al Gore haters out there... please get over yourselves.  This is about the message and not the messenger.  This documentary is a timely, well-documented DVD.  We need someone (anything!) to wake us up out of our materialistic stupor.  It presents scientific facts and gives you actual (and reasonable) options for ways to act to protect YOUR future legacy to your children and grandchildren.  So Gore haters please try and be objective about the message.  Your own children might one day want to know that you actually did something morally appropriate in the face of real crisis other than posture about who you don't like politically.

B000FQJAIW|3.0|Whether or not the vitriol some reviewers have is justified, the specifications speak for themselves.  It states on the back of the case that on Disc 1 (the Special Edition version), the aspect ratio is 2.35:1, enhanced for 16:9 widescreen TVs, with English Dolby 5.1 Surround EX, along with various multilanguage Dolby 2.0 options.  On Disc 2 (the original theatrical version), the aspect ratio is 2.35:1 in 4:3 Letterbox format; the only sound options are in Dolby 2.0.  These stats alone indicate that the theatrical version is not presented with the same technological panache as the Special Edition.  Whether or not this is \\"wrong\\" is purely subjective.  However, there is no way a non-anamorphic, 4:3 letterboxed DVD can properly fill a widescreen TV without some sort of stretching, zooming, or cropping, all of which distort the original viewing image in some way.  On my 46\\" Sony Bravia 1080p LCD set, connected via HDMI cable to my 720p/1080i upconverting DVD player, the only way to view the picture in its original aspect ratio is to have very thick black bands on all sides of the frame, making the viewing image absurdly small relative to the size of the screen.  Any other viewing option results in some loss of resolution, and often stretched and widened images.  And if you think I'm some kind of technical idiot, think again.  (Frankly, I'd be more worried about being labeled an idiot if I were not able to tell that a non-anamorphic DVD does not properly fill my widescreen monitor, then decided to post on Amazon.com, blathering about things I don't understand, and calling everybody else idiots.  But that's just me.)  Personally, I find the theatrical version to be fairly watchable, even when stretched to fill the screen, much the same way I find a good VHS tape on good equipment to be watchable; indeed, it is better than VHS, about on a par with Laserdisc, but it certainly presents a less state-of-the-art home theatrical experience than the lushly done-up Special Edition.  Beyond the technical specifications of the two discs, it is also clear that Lucas did not put as much care into the restoration of the theatrical version.  Dust spots are clearly visible in places, and colors are more muted and black levels less pronounced than in the Special Edition.  Sound is also an issue.  The stereo sound is decent, but again not up to the Special Edition's 5.1 mix. In addition to the lack of surround \\"atmosphere,\\" the LFE (Low Frequency Effect) is notably lacking in certain areas (e.g., when R2 thuds to the ground after being zapped by the Jawas).  While the theatrical version is not unwatchable on its own, it pales in comparison to the Special Edition's appearance and sound, and as such has somewhat of a \\"historical\\" feel about it, as though it were included for documentarian purposes, rather than as enjoyable home-theater fare.  I'm glad to have it in any format, but I personally would have been happier if Lucas had presented the three original theatrical versions on their own - rather than bundled with the Special Editions - properly restored, and presented in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 surround mixes.  That's what these masterpieces deserve.<br /><br />3 stars for the theatrical version, docked 2 stars from 5 due to technologically inferior presentation.  4.5 stars for the Special Edition, docked .5 stars from 5 only because I like the theatrical version better.  The movie itself is 5 stars all the way, but you don't need me to tell you that.
B000E6ENPS|5.0|I love Walk the Line because it was about my favorite singer Johnny Cash. Joaquin and Reese did a wonderful job of playing Johnny and June. I am gald that Reese and Joaquin won a Golden Globe award for best actress and actor for Walk the Line. Joaquin is my favorite actor and Reese is my favorite actress. If you like Johnny Cash and June Carter I recommend you rent or buy it. My Mom and I saw Walk the Line at the movies and I liked Walk the Line. When Walk the Line came out on DVD I bought Walk the Line the Fullframe and The 2- Disc Edition. I can't stop watching Walk the Line. Everytime I watch My Walk the Line DVD I sing along with Joaquin and Reese. I also bought Walk the Line Soundtrack. Joaquin and Reese sung better than the real Johnny and June Carter Cash in Walk the Line
B0002XL35G|5.0|This is a very long movie with virtually no physical \\"action.\\" It is words and feelings and feelings not spoken that should be and all permutations of the above. The understated performances from all lend themselves to the broad expanse of space Wenders creates here. The actors give full, highly complex performances, but within the context of the Texas desert and the American southwest, the humans are dwarfed by the world around them.<br /><br />This movie will not appeal to everyone. It is talky and the language borders on the poetic quite often. The ending is both satisfying and not satisfying and leaves many questions. I, for one, can't help but think the child ends up back with Travis' brother Walt and his wife. However, that could be argued. Trust me, it has been.<br /><br />Anyhow, this is a fascinating character study in which the scenery and the music become active characters in the film. Dean Stockwell controls the first 45 minutes or so and then deftly hands it over to Harry Dean Stanton who then hands it over to Nastassja Kinski. In the middle of all this is the keeper of the baton, Hunter Carson. It is an amazing piece of work for them all.

So in a great opening parallel montage, Spielberg depicts the personal journey of one man and the massive journey of one race...<br /><br />As thousand of families are forced to abandon their careers, properties and homes to live in overcrowded ghettos, the scene switches to Schindler, where he pays his way to get a fine table at a fancy nightclub in Nazi-occupied city of Krakow, the surviving gem of Poland's medieval cities...<br /><br />Drinking alone, he scans the strange clientele and slowly sets about casting his nets on the SS German officers... He quickly plied them with food, caviar and French wine... And as a magician, overcoming every resistance, he transforms the separate tables of the cabaret into one joyful drunken party of wine, women, and song for the Nazi officials...<br /><br />The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern and offers him a deal... Since Jews cannot own businesses, they should work together... Stern's contacts can provide investors, and Stern's expertise can run the business, and Schindler will take care of the presentation...<br /><br />In those same scenes, Amon Goeth is introduced...<br /><br />Goeth is a flabby psychopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism... He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and must be bribed and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business... Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from an opportunistic 'victimizer' to 'humanitarian.'<br /><br />Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler, the businessman with irresistible charm - the charm of the same magnitude that saved hundreds of innocent people and brightened Schindler's reputation among critical historians... As movie gradually progresses, Schindler's perspective changes much as when he himself states that \\"People die - it's a fact of life.\\"<br /><br />Neeson's flexibility as an actor is impressive... His performance is built on a combination of self-confidence, indecision, and doubt... His character is always evolving, yet always convincing... His transformation from 'war profiteer' to a \\"righteous\\" man is adequately slow and well developed... As the war draws to a close, Schindler decides unexpectedly to evaluate his life... He turns over his gains into a noble cause - and virtually takes his workers away from being swallowed up by the Holocaust... In one of the film's most touching scenes, Schindler goes to Auschwitz and fights for the freedom of the wives and children of his workers...<br /><br />Ben Kingsley plays the role of Itzhak Stern, the timid gifted accountant, and the silent partner wary of his employer and the enemy... Stern (spared from the horrors of the holocaust) is also Schindler's good angel... He occasionally reminds the audacious man that he could get in a lot of trouble if his true motives are ever discovered... Kingley delivers history's judgment of Oskar Schindler in a touching moment: 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes brilliantly portrays Amon Goethe, the complex study of a sadistic true monster... He is a heartless and cruel killer, with a complicated, twisted personality... Stripped to the waist and overlooking the prison yard, he leaves his mistress Ingrid (Beatrice Macola) in bed to shoot arbitrarily, with his scope rifle, slow-moving Jews from the veranda of his high villa...<br /><br />Goeth despises Jews, yet he inexplicably falls in love with a shy Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Rather than allowing himself to touch her, and nearly committing the capital crime of kissing her, he remembers that he is supposed to hate her, and beats her ruthlessly for seducing him...<br /><br />Goeth is a man to despise... But the full scope of his atrocities are not entirely shown... Spielberg shows carefully as much of the horror as the screen can bear...<br /><br />The savage scenes are difficult to watch... Spielberg's camera pans to the pillar of dark smoke rising from the chimney stack into the frightening sky of Auschwitz, and to the lines of Jews unknowingly lead toward the gas chambers...<br /><br />Spielberg captures the terror of the Nazi reign in the terrifying dramatic moments when stunned women and children are mistakenly sent to Auschwitz... The disturbing images of arbitrary murder are harshly realistic...<br /><br />'Schindler's List' assaults the viewer with lasting images of Jewish prisoners announcing their names as they are registered, given work assignments, or separated into \\"essential\\" and \\"non-essential.\\"<br /><br />Spielberg focuses on children and uses them both as victimizers and victims... In a powerful way to personalize the slaughter without a single word, Spielberg colors the coat of a little girl as she is invisibly making her way, aimless and alone, through the chaotic destruction of the Krakow ghetto... (It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun', in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home).<br /><br />'Schindler's List' is a tribute to those who lost their lives in the Holocaust, a dramatic recreation of that dark, frightening period during World War II... The horror is alleviated, slightly, by Janusz Kaminski's stunning Black and White cinematography... The lack of color reminds us of German Expressionist films, and allows Spielberg to be explicit without becoming tastelessly graphic... John Williams' tragic and somber, almost unnoticed score adds to the melancholy tone...<br /><br />Spielberg's great visual moments - when, in a scene, Schindler joins the Nazis on the platform as they fire the cold water at the cars on the desperate, suffocating people inside...<br /><br />'Schindler's List' is an outstanding movie... It has an important role in adding credibility to the Holocaust, and in Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel, Spielberg finds the right balance of redemption and sorrow.. He makes us watch and feel the extermination through the actions of Oskar Schindler...he full scope of his atrocities are not entirely shown...

B00008WT5E|3.0|Ac/Dc is a band that is unlike any other band out there,they have never changed,they have never tried to experiment with concept albums or radio-friendly love songs,or invited other writers in to get their videos in regular rotation,they have never followed trends...simply put,Ac/Dc crank up the guitars to 10 and have fun.Isn't that really what rock and roll is about? You never have to think too hard while listening to their music,which is a good thing. If you want to think about social conditions or politics while listening to music this is not the band for you.However,if you want to crank it up and have fun,this is the perfect band. Powerage followed the fantastic \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and somehow got lost along the way. Many people passed by this great release which is a shame.It is extremely similar and in my opinion is almost as good as the two CD's before it 'Let There Be Rock' and 'High Voltage'...there are no leaps forward but that's okay...Angus is still playing the best blues based leads on the planet and Bon Scott can still scream and sneer better than any of his peers...the only problem with this release is that there were no huge anthems like the previous albums had...there are no \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" or \\"TnT\\" but this CD does include Sin City which I think is right up there with the top 10 songs Ac/Dc ever recorded...it also includes Rock And Roll Damnation which is one of my personal favorites from this genius band...Riff Raff is another great song...and Down Payment  Blues is another great one...but with the exception of the very cool vibe of 'Gone Shootin' (which was featured in the Beavis And Butthead movie) the second half of this CD pretty much flops...the first half is classic but it definitely ends on a downer..all that being said,you really can't go wrong with anything from Ac/Dc..their songs are all from the heart and Bon's vocals and lyrics are always entertaining and Angus is the king of blues based rock and roll...if only for Rock And Roll Damnation and Sin City alone this CD is worth it's price...but the rest of the CD is either great or pretty good too...so it's definitely worth buying...but if you're new to the band start with Highway To Hell and Back In Black..then check out the whole back catalog...this band is extremely consistant..every album is similar and very much fun to crank up and bang your head to!<br /><br />The Upside - Sin City and Rock And Roll Damnation are true masterpieces...great production throughout...great songs to turn up loud and have fun with...every Ac/Dc album should be required listening for any fan of rock<br /><br />The Downside - The second half of this CD is definitely not up to the standards of the first half...It sounds almost too similar to the past 2 releases 'high voltage' 'let there be rock' so much so if you put all 3 albums together you might think they recorded them on the same day.<br /><br />The Bottom Line - While it is not nearly the best Ac/Dc CD out there it has great production...great songs...and features Sin City (one of the best songs they ever recorded). There are no terrible songs and a lot of the songs are actually great. It's most definitely worth buying and it's for any fan of rock and roll...my only advice is to start with Highway To Hell or Back In Black and then come back to CDs like this or 'High Voltage'...Powerage is a true classic CD that shows what rock and roll was meant to be...loud,simple,and fun...crank it up and have a blast this CD is great...the donutman says so!!!mnation and Sin City alone this CD is worth it's price...but the rest of the CD is either great or pretty good too...so it's definitely worth buying...but if you're new to the band start with Highway To Hell and Back In Black..then check out the whole back catalog...this band is extremely consistant..every album is similar and very much fun to crank up and bang your head to! <br /> <br />The Upside - Sin City and Rock And Roll Damnation are true masterpieces...great production throughout...great songs to turn up loud and have fun with...every Ac/Dc album should be required listening for any fan of rock <br /> <br />The Downside - The second half of this CD is definitely not up to the standards of the first half...It sounds almost too similar to the past 2 releases 'high voltage' 'let there be rock' so much so if you put all 3 albums together you might think they recorded them on the same day. <br /> <br />The Bottom Line - While it is not nearly the best Ac/Dc CD out there it has great production...great songs...and features Sin City (one of the best songs they ever recorded).

B0000AMRJD|3.0|The story turns around Antonio 'Scarface' Montana, an ultra-violent Cuban refugee who comes to the United States with less than nothing, and makes a place for himself at the top of the cocaine trade...<br /><br />As a calculating man with a conscience, and extreme ambitions, Tony strongly begins to desire the things he sees a criminal high-roller enjoying, including his luscious lover... Heights his way out of a refugee camp by enjoying the chance to stab a former taker of Freedom, takes out rival dealers, gains the confidence of an important drug lord by eclipsing a local gang boss in Miami, and eventually makes it to the highest levels of the drug organization...<br /><br />Pacino shows the results of greed and lust for power on the human psyche... He guns his way through the sunny streets of Miami where he got 'the world and everything in it.' With his ruthlessness, obscene dialog, and his negotiation skills, he begins to imagine himself invulnerable and above all others... He quickly moves deep to the world of gangs, and becomes more ruthless than anyone else can possibly imagine...<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer looks dazzling as the addicted wife with no inner life... She succeeds in portraying the trophy 'object' navigating uncertain waters with her anti-hero... Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio happens to be the best in Tony's life, the only thing that is good and pure... Her revulsion at the end of the movie is so fiery that her whole head could have blown off... Robert Loggia exhibits a weak and fearful disposition, especially when faced with Pacino as a challenger... He proves to be a less-ambitious boss in a position of power... Steven Bauer shines as the man of charm, loyal ally and faithful friend...<br /><br />The Oliver Stone-scripted 'Scarface' is a change in genre, lifting scene after scene of Hawks' classic while updating the rise-and-fall gangster saga to modern, drug-infested Miami... But, as always, the focus is on decadence, profanity and violence--memorably a sickening chainsaw murder, rather than on the psychological and social reasons for the hoodlum's psychopathic behavior...der, rather than on the psychological and social reasons for the hoodlum's psychopathic behavior...
B00008WT5C|3.0|Let there be rock was the Usa follow up to High Voltage...Ac/Dc is a band unlike any other,in that the style has never changed no matter what. If you put on their debut album High Voltage and compare it to the latest \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" released many many many years later,it sounds extremely similar,as if it could have been released a few months later (of course with the exception of Bon Scott's vocals) All that being said,I love this CD as I love all Ac/Dc releases. They always play from the heart and put 100 percent into every song. You can't say that for many bands,most bands release songs onto their albums that you know darn well were just thrown on there to take up space. Let there be rock is very similar in style to high voltage,the lyric content is much the same as is the driving beats and three chord anthems...I wish I could have given this a 3 and a half star review because it is certainly above average but I can't in good conscience say it is one step below perfect either..there are some fantastic memorable songs on this,such as the title cut \\"Let There Be Rock\\" \\"hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\",\\"Overdose\\" and of course the absolute best song on the CD \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\",those songs are right up there with any of the best songs from the entire Ac/Dc catalog,but there are some songs that don't stand up (in my opinion) such as \\"Go Down\\" and \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" ..it's not that they aren't great songs because they are,it's just that they aren't as catchy or memorable. The one thing I never quite understood is why they released \\"Problem Child\\" on this CD and a few years later released the same exact song on the Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap CD...it is a great song but why put it on twice? This is definitely a great CD...the production is top notch and very clear and all fans of good rock and roll and metal should buy this...but if you are new to the band start with Highway To Hell or Back In Black to get a true taste of the genius of this band...they stuck to their guns and will live forever in rock history<br /><br />the upside - blues based rock/metal at it's finest...some extremely tasty lead guitar playing by Angus and some of the best metal screaming in the world by Bon Scott...great production,a great booklet with awesome pictures and stories comes with it, and some classic songs including \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" which is one of the best Ac/Dc songs ever...all 8 songs are great to rock out to and crank up to 10<br /><br />the downside - only 8 songs...no bonus tracks on the remastered edition,and one of the 8 songs \\"problem child\\" can be found on Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap...many of the songs on this album sound nearly identical to songs on the previous release 'high voltage' and the one to follow 'powerage'<br /><br />the bottom line - with Ac/Dc you simply can't go wrong...this is what rock and roll was meant to be...you should buy this CD if you love rock and roll of any kind because it would appeal to fans of blues rock,metal,and all styles in between..great production...it's not their best CD but even an average Ac/Dc release is better than most band's best CD...go out and buy this but I recommend first buying Back In Black and Highway To Hell and then you'll be ready to crank up \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and air guitar the day away...this band rocks and this CD rocks ..the donutman says sod will live forever in rock history <br /> <br /> <br />the upside - blues based rock/metal at it's finest...some extremely tasty lead guitar playing by Angus and some of the best metal screaming in the world by Bon Scott...great production,a great booklet with awesome pictures and stories comes with it, and some classic songs including \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" which is one of the best Ac/Dc songs ever...all 8 songs are great to rock out to and crank up to 10 <br /> <br />the downside - only 8 songs...no bonus tracks on the remastered edition,and one of the 8 songs \\"problem child\\" can be found on Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap...many of the songs on this album sound nearly identical to songs on the previous release 'high voltage' and the one to follow 'powerage' <br /> <br />the bottom line - with Ac/Dc you simply can't go wrong...this is what rock and roll was meant to be...you should buy this CD if you love rock and roll of any kind because it would appeal to fans of blues rock,metal,and all styles in between..great production...it's not their best CD but even an average Ac/Dc release is better than most band's best CD...go out and buy this but I recommend first buying Back In Black and Highway To Hell and then you'll be ready to crank up \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and air guitar the day away...this band rocks and this CD rocks ..the donutman says so
0743454537|4.0|This book is a fast read (if you tend to become addicted to books), though it does take a few chapters to get oriented to who's who (the story is narrated in pieces, by each of the characters in turn).  Chances are that you'll love some characters and hate others, though none of the people Picoult describes are distinctively \\"evil\\" or \\"good.\\"  If you had a painful childhood, be prepared for some flashbacks: only a novel of this calibre is capable of producing such anger/joy/hatred in its readers.   <br /> <br />Reading it, I thought that the book was written solely for this year/time/generation: while it is definitely a step above many popular novels, your children probably won't study it in their English classes because the issues are so pointedly pertinent to now.  Picoult tries, I think, to keep her own ethical viewpoint to herself, but does not succeed completely.  There's no doubt who she's rooting for, or which side she'd be on in a debate on \\"designer babies.\\"  A few of the characters are also somewhat stereotyped and/or worn-out: the ruthless lawyer who's actually (surprise!) not such a Scrooge; the rebellious oldest son; the bitter and man-hating lesbian, who seemed added to the cast of characters purely to create drama and make the story more \\"colorful\\" (oooh--a gay character!).   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the book's a good read, especially if you enjoy the world of medicine and science.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|This movie is boring.  The 3 funny parts in it, are not worth sitting the whole hour and 1/2 for.  This movie  could have been so much better.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|forget the black and whites, this is what Middle American Christmas is actually like.  No flashbacks in time or convincing of the likelihood Santa will come, just straight forward hard working American common folks!
B00005JPDS|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in quite a while. I saw it at the movie theatre and there were people in tears at the end. It was awesome. Will Smith and his son did a great job in this movie. Definitely a movie to have in your collection.
1594200823|5.0|This book will really open your eyes to where your food comes from. If you want your friends and family to be healthy, read this book, and pass it on!  It is intelligent and the mood is light-hearted, as all Michael Pollan's writings are, even though he adresses critical and serious subjects like our food supply and our daily meals.  Such a good an imporant read should not be passed up!
B00007E8O5|1.0|I did not like this set at all.  It's even worse when compared to what Alice In Chains released.  These songs, as previously mentioned, are  plodding.  Jerry's vocals don't sound good, either.  Boggy Depot was MUCH better than this.  Get that CD if you want to hear what Jerry can do.
0823016714|4.0|Some useful photos and information.  Much more a reference book than instructional, and I have to agree with the reviewer that said this is more for cartooning than portrait drawing.   <br /> <br />That being said, it's not useless.  I will definately refer to it, and there are some more natural poses and useful information.  I didn't think the faces were ugly, certainly intresting, but then most figures in paintings that are enjoyable to look at aren't classicly beautiful.  It's not a stand alone book, but certainly one to add to your library of reference material.
B000002OOY|5.0|This is an amazing soudtrack, one of William's best. I'm not going to explain how good it is, you have to buy it and listen to it yourself to realize the genius in this. However, I just finished watching Jurassic Park 1 (I've gotten into the tradition of watching it once a year; that way, I don't remember everything each time I watch it), and I noticed one piece of music that is not on this CD! In the beginning, after the incident at Isla Nublar, right before you see Grant and the other guys digging for fossils, you see the Spanish guy (or whatever he is) say that the other guy can't get (Alan) Grant. He tells him, \\"Because Grant's like me...he's a digger.\\" Listen to the music. Isn't that awesome!!? Then there's more music when you see Grant digging. I can't believe they left that out. I'd pay twenty dollars more just to have that on the CD. Just think: Track 4 - Digging for Fossils.  <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong - it seems like nearly everything is on the CD(unlike certain others [i.e. Dead Man's Chest]), so I'm glad for that. But still!!! Just a WEEE bit more music and it would've been perfect. Oh Well. The stuff that's on here is brilliant enough. <br /> <br />Along with \\"Superman - The Movie\\", \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" and, of course, the Star Wars Trilogy, this is one of the best soundtracks ever created, and some of the greatest music ever made. Why get some overrated junk like Lord of the Rings when you can get this classic?
0823016285|5.0|Love this book, saw improvements within the first hour of reading it.  I love the breakdown of the whole head into parts, then the parts are broken down even further.  I was also impressed with the \\"common mistakes\\" referred to in the book that were my common mistakes! <br /> <br />Very usable information, not too technical, and in addition to helping pin down the emotion you're trying to add to a face, it contains a lot of practical advice to improve the overall \\"realistic\\" look of a portrait.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|When it was first announced that director Tim Burton was filming \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", starring the talented Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, concerns were raised that it may not be as good as the original 1971 film \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\".  However, when the author of the original book, Roald Dahl (1916-1990), upon which both films were based saw the 1971 film, he was so disgusted that he forced the film's producers to rename it to \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\".  Though we will never know today how Roald Dahl would have reacted to the Tim Burton's 2005 version, chances are that Roald Dahl would have been far more pleased with the result. <br /> <br />Unlike the 1971 version, the 2005 version both parents of the young Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) are still alive.  His mother Mrs. Bucket (Helena Bonham Carter) and his father Mr. Bucket (Noah Taylor) struggle to support their son, as well as each of the aging parents: Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) who had previously worked at Willy Wonka's factory, Grandma Georgina (Liz Smith, who some viewers may recognize as the character Letitia Cropley from the 1994-1996 British sitcom \\"The Vicar of Dibley\\"), Grandpa George (David Morris) and Grandma Josephine (Eileen Essell). Unfortunately, things get worse financially for the Buckets when Mr. Bucket is laid off from the toothpaste factory where he had worked; but the announcement of five golden tickets hidden within five Willy Wonka chocolate bars that will grant the winners to a visit to the mysterious chocolate factory sends the world into a frenzy to find them.  The lucky children that do find them are Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) and his mother Mrs. Gloop (Franziska Troegner); Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) and her mother Mrs. Beauregarde (Missi Pyle); Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and her wealthy father Mr. Salt (James Fox); Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry) and his father Mr. Teevee (Adam Godley); and finally, Charlie Bucket, who is accompanied by Grandpa Joe. <br /> <br />Another interesting aspect that separates this film from the original is the exploration of Willy Wonka's childhood (Little Willy is played by Blair Dunlop). His father, the eminent dentist Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee), forbids Little Willy from ever eating any candy or chocolate and forces Little Willy into a maniacal headpiece that prevents Little Willy from closing his mouth so that everyone can see the braces on his teeth.  However, Little Willy, after going trick-or-treating, finds a piece of chocolate that his father had not completely destroyed.  Upon eating it, Little Willy is obsessed with candy and chocolate, which eventually leads to Dr. Wonka abandoning Little Willy.  However, Little Willy has big plans and eventually opens his chocolate factory; but when competitors send spies into his factory, he fires all of his workers and eventually replaces them with the oompa-loompas (with the aid of special effects, each oompa-loompa is played by one actor: Deep Roy). <br /> <br />With engaging characters, wonderful songs sung by the oompa-loompas, colorful cinematography, great dialog, superb direction and brilliant acting, I rate the 2005 \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone. <br />
B000AM4PBS|5.0|This is the most satisfying item I ever bought online. Came in a package of more than what I expected. It is just fabulous. What can I say, it is the BEST. I recommend Friends fans to get one and others to get it and add to your DVD collection. The packaging and quality of DVDs are extremely good. This is a \\"must have\\" for your collection.
B000J103YI|4.0|i have just recently seen the movie, but i bought the soundtrack well before seeing the movie, and i am glad that i did.  the soundtrack follows the movie very well and everyone on the soundtrack sounds awesome.  the songs are great and there is only one track that i dont like, jimmy's rap, which i really dont care for.  my favorite songs are Dreamgirls, Move, Listen, One Night Only (disco version), and I'm Telling You.  these for me are the real stand outs on the album, enough so that i have to sing way out loud in my car.  by listening to the soundtrack before the movie, it helped me get excited about how they were going introduce the songs in the movie.  and to watch the songs performed onscreen was awesome.  Jennifer Hudson is really reminding me of Aretha Franklin, and i just love it.  the girl has some pipes on her and i love to hear her belt out a song.  and to also see her perform I'm Telling You is something to behold.  she believed what she was singing and you can hear it in her voice and see it on the screen, i really hope she gets the academy award, i think that it is well deserved, she not only sang in the movie but acted very well.  and what can i say about beyonce.  i love that woman, and i do mean woman.  the three songs i listed previously that she sang make me love her even more.  see the movie and watch her sing listen to jamie foxx and tell me she is not a diva.  i really loved her singing in this movie and it also comes across well on the soundtrack, she just continues to impress me.  eddie murphy does an excellent james brown impression, and he does an awesome job with his songs, he should also be remembered come award time.  buy the soundtrack it is well worth it.
B000001FDQ|5.0|It was 1984. Me and my friends were very into metal bands from USA at the time. We were following the glam bands mainly but we used to love bands like Metallica and Anthrax too. Those were the hair metal days! One of my friends one day told me \\"I heard an album from a great swedish rock guitarist is coming out and it will be ALL guitar solos\\". I perfectly remember that I said \\"what a bore this album should be, ALL guitar solos?!\\" Then Rising force came out and it was a shock. Because the very first time I put it on the intensity of the music, Yngwie's completly innovative musical personality and blazing virtuosity, his impressive musicality (that was something absolutly new and unique!) completly blew me away. At the time Yngwie exploded onto the scene and he became a huge star overnight. In those days Van Halen was the guy everyone tried to emulate in the rock context but Yngwie showed a completly different way of playing the guitar being as good as Eddie. He showed there was a way to sound different from Van Halen being at the same level! It was sensational! His classic minor runs, his classical music quotes, played with sincerity and attitude, his unbelievable blues-Hendrix chops, the epic flavour of his music made him unique and totally devastating! He was recognizable from the very first note (and still he is of course). One of the most difficult and important things for a musician! I can't forget that I completly fell in love with Yngwie, he seemed to me the most virtuosistic player ever! And I really loved his music! I listened to this album over and over, I did buy the VHS of his concert in Japan (if I remember well it was a japanese concert) and I played it a million times. It was amazing to see this guy from the old and dusty Europe coming out with something so fantastic, so fresh, so unique, with an attitude SO BAD and so proud of his european roots! An european who was able to be a serious pretender to the world's best guitarist crown! Wow! And this album was only the first! I thought \\"wow if this is only his first album what will he do in the future!?\\". And luckly Yngwie produced a lot of very good album in the years that followed, but not legendary as this one. This one to me is legendary as \\"Van Halen 1\\". It is completly different of course but it is equally beautiful and it is together with it, one of the most important guitar album of all time. ABSOLUTLY! No doubt about it. After this one Yngwie has been copied thousands of times by thousands of players all over the world. Now his music may sound repetitive, maybe he is out of ideas, but I don't forget that he is one of the most fantastic musicians this our instrument, the guitar, had the privilege to have in its team. With this album a force was really rising, it was Yngwie! Thank you for the inspiration Yngwie J. Malmsteen!m was only the first!

B00008J4P5|5.0|This is a great cd from a great band.  This 2000 generation has more than dissapointing when it comes to music.  We have nothing but bad rap artists that all sound the same, and stupid emo-screamo!  Well for those of you like me still stuck in the past because nothing good has been released since the 90's, then this album is for you!  Its amazing, has great pure rock and roll.  Its bluesy, fast, and even dark and emotional at times.  Its perfect for any fan of led zeppelin, the ramones, nirvana, or anything!.  This is one band that the 2000 can be remembered for.  Jack white saved rock and roll.  I am not just stuck to one style of music, and that is why I love this album,  its a complete variety!  Bring us more bands like the white stripes!  Doesnt anyone have a passion for music anymore.  And I am not saying all the music in 2000 has been bad.... bands like greenday and nine inch nails have both released amazing albums, but these are the same bands I have been listening to for the past 13 years!  I want NEW bands, that I can get into and enjoy for the next 20 years to come!  Well the white stripes is exactly what I was looking for in a band.  This cd is worth every penny!
B000002J29|5.0|This was from the height of their careers together.  Hackett still hanging on, and still doing the classics in concert - not commercially successful yet.  Collins shows his natural stage presence all over both disks.  My favorite live album of any band.
B000I5X81A|3.0|\\"Kyle realizes they were so wrapped up in trying to protect their music they forgot to just play. Real artists play for the love of music, not the money. Moop ends their strike; the other artists that joined them confess that they are only in it for the money.\\" _South_Park_ -Christian Rock Hard-<br /><br />Yep, I buy new music and that pretty much sums up my experiance.  What happened to albums like 24 Nights, or Crossroads?  The raw blues, hard guitar solos that scream and cry.  I listened to this while on a road trip and it only aided in making me sleepy.  I switched back to Sirius to listen to the \\"Crooners\\" Dean Martin etc.  If this album grows on me I will be back to change this rating, but I doubt it.

0345440900|5.0|As a mom who read MANY different baby books (including those recommended by my OB, my OB friends, other mothers, pediatricians, etc), this one was the most helpful to me.  The chapter on interpreting cries was very helpful as was the gentle feeding guidance.  As a mom who had a GREAT deal of difficulty with breastfeeding, despite extensive effort, Tracy was a voice of sanity that I needed.  Breastfeeding IS best, but she also helps those of us who had trouble.  Easy to pick up and read at any stage in the first year, but especially helpful in the first few months.<br /><br />The problem that I seem to find in reading others' reviews is that they disagreed with one or two points in the book and discarded the whole thing.  I got a great deal out of this book, and also got advice that I utilized from other books.  I am not an advocate of \\"cry it out\\" and found that sticking to a basic routine (that was flexible when needed!) made my house a whole lot more sane.  Did I follow EVERY bit of advice?  No - because it didn't work for me.  Use your head and take what you can in the way of advice - trying to be a perfectionist and doing everything that ANYONE tells you is crazy.  There is such a thing as moderation, which is what I appreciated about this book.
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie gives you laughs and morals which you do not see much anymore. It gives a lesson in it also. As an adult I bought this movie and will watch it over and over.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters back in 1992 and it was great. It is timeless in that everything about the security and technical issues outlined in the movie are relevent today if not more. When Cosmo states\\" it's all about the information, what we hear, see, etc..\\" is so right on in our over connected world of the internet, cable news, podcasts, cell phones, camera phones, intrusive web cam/phone technologies, blogs, wirless, blackberries, rfid, youtupe, myspace, online ecommerce, protocols, protocols and more protocols. <br /> <br />It is all about the network today and the information that flows through it. Do you remember how your life was pre 1995 internet and cell phones? <br />Can you imagine your life without your various access points to the internet, its content and your cell phone? <br /> <br />Cosmo was wrong when he said it is no longer about energy, it is still today for without the energy you have no means to propogate the information.  <br /> <br />They nailed it then and it is relevent today. Scary.  <br /> <br />Great movie and got me excited to try my hand at a little black/white hacking.
B00005QIPH|5.0|With a million units sold, it is still merely considered gold.  Platinum is what it should be if you ask me. This band could not have had a better debut or the world would have stopped. It is a classic album, with great tunes that talk about simple things like chasing after girls, walking out the door and chasing that girl no longer, getting wasted, and missing old days hanging out with friends. If it wasnt for this album........what would have saved modern rock? Paul McCartney? Oasis? Actually, nothing would have. Right now we would have rock that was created by computer sounds. Thank god for THE STROKES!!!!

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|First Impressions Of Earth.........Could there have been a better album name for a 2006 release? No. This album is an expreimental masterpiece. Too bad England was the only one that noticed it. Songs on here like You Only Live Once, Heart in a Cage, Razorblade, Ize Of The World, and Red Light are all golden. Get this album now or you will regret it.  The Strokes, the best rock band of our times.
B000K9L32U|3.0|The career trajectory of Take That bears a striking resemblance to that of 80s pop duo Wham. Their first albums (\\"Fantastic\\" by Wham, \\"Take That & Party\\" by Take That) were embodiments of cheesiness and the signs of debutant teenage musicians trying to define their \\"sound\\". Both their sophomore efforts were breakthrough albums in their own right (\\"Make it Big\\" by Wham, \\"Everything Changes\\" by Take That) - both with long strings of memorable hit singles that left indellible impressions in the pop world as well as in the hearts of music listeners all over the world. Their final albums (\\"Music from the Edge of Heaven\\" by Wham and \\"Nobody Else\\") were weaker albums relative to their predecessors but their shortcomings were eclipsed by fantastic hit singles that practically became their musical signatures (\\"Last Christmas\\" by Wham, and \\"Back for Good\\" by Take That). The musical reins of both groups were held by one member (George Michael in Wham, and Gary Barlow in Take That). Both groups called it quits at their zenith.<br /><br />The year 2006 marks the end of this striking parallelism. 10 years after calling it quits, the four lads (now mature adults in their mid-30s) of Take That have decided to step back into the limelight together and record new material - a rather bold and risky decision (an idea Wham did not give even the slightest consideration to). The expectations are undoubtedly high and probably quite unrealistic - especially in the wake of the musical legacy Take That left listeners with when they made their graceful exit as a quartet (formerly a quintet with Robbie Williams) in 1996. While this \\"comeback\\" is bound to make longtime fans incredibly happy, one cannot help but ask the following question. Is there a musical direction that former successful \\"boybands\\" can take to be relevant in the current music scene while recreating the so-called \\"glory days\\"? The more important question is whether or not boybands truly have a limited shelf-life. Both questions are answered with one listen of Take That's latest offering \\"Beautiful World\\".<br /><br />\\"Beautiful World\\" marks a shift in pattern of the band's approach to music. Formerly, almost all the songwriting was done by Gary Barlow. In comparison, this album is the epitome of a musical democracy. Along with songwriting input from all four members, the collection of songs showcases the vocal capabilities of each individual band member. \\"Patience\\" - the first single off the album is quite representative of the overall sound of the album - a \\"middle of the road\\" collection of adult contemporary ballads that possess a relatively acoustic sound in relation to earlier material by the band. The voice of each member has remained intact during their hiatus and as a group, they still harmonize beautifully. There are no bad songs on the album. Yet, there are no striking singles of the kind that helped Take That differentiate themselves from the average boyband in the mid-90s. While sales of the album are bound to be propelled by the success of their recent reunion tour as well as nostalgia, the grim reality is that this is an average album, at best. While longtime fans from the group's heyday are bound to be pleased, it is highly unlikely that Take That will create a new fanbase with \\"Beautiful World\\". The album is the definitive resource to answering questions posed earlier. The short shelf-life of boybands is inevitable (Take That is not an exception to this phenomenon) and a musical direction that a formerly successful \\"boyband\\" adopts to stay relevant today cannot be defined overnight. Judging by the fact that the time horizon that included the 4 men reuniting as a band, embarking on a reunion tour, and completing this album spanned less than a year, it is evident that the idea of a successful musical direction was not pondered over at all.<br /><br />That being said, the three songs that longtime fans will probably warm up to quite easily are \\"Reach Out\\", \\"Patience\\", and \\"Beautiful World\\" - indications that the album is very listenable and quite enjoyable, but far from stellar.d \\"Beautiful World\\" - indications that the album is very listenable and quite enjoyable, but far from stellar.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This album is a masterpiece!!! Why did it receive mixed reviews? This album was better than their acclaimed debut album IS THIS IT. Songs on here include 12:51,Reptilia, I Cant Win, wow too many great songs to list. The Strokes are  truly the best rock band of our times, but it looks like America would much rather be listening to emo nonsense like Fall Out Boy, a band called \\"My Chemical Romance\\", Panic! At The Disco, and Death Cab For Cutie. Wow, why? The        <br />Strokes=The Saviors of Modern Rock. Turn up your speakers and listen to this album at full blast, even better go out and buy this album.
1580086810|5.0|This is a beautiful book. I had expected this to be a visually intriguing and fun book for the coffee-table, yet this work is far more than a trivial coffee-table book; it is also a great read.  The writing is vivid, thought provoking, and humanizing, and there is also important geographical and economic information throughout.  Reading Hungry Planet definitely expanded my understanding of our world and the diverse people that inhabit it.  I really enjoyed the pictures, and found the portraits of the families standing with their monthly supply of food to be powerful displays of inequality.  Personally, I was surprised that while many of the Western countries had so much more in terms quantity, it seemed that many of the other countries enjoyed so much more in terms quality (aside from those in refugee camps).   <br /> <br />Overall an amazing book, after buying one for myself I ended up buying three more copies as gifts.
B000EHQ57Q|5.0|Okay, let's start off by addressing some of the complaints that most people have. As far as the bass being mixed too low on this release I have to say after owning this in every lp and cd edition that the bass was always a bit lower on this album than on some of the other Moodies albums. The mix itself is from the original quad lp versions done by producer Tony Clarke in early 1972. The quad mixes were different in order to take advantage of the four way split instead of the regular stereo two way split. This meant mixing the album differently from a conventional stereo album. Many of the \\"effects\\" that are in the backgroud of the stereo version are turned up here changing the overall \\"balanced\\" sound of the album in order to give the best quad sound. As far as the music itself, this album has a much more basic feel than the band's last, To Our Children's Children's Children which might have had in part something to do with the fact that it wasn't the big hit the band wanted at the time it was released. That was the first released for their label Threshold. The opening song Question had been released on single a few months before this album's release and had become a big hit for the band. This album includes many Moodies classics and doesn't have a bad song on the release. Songs like Question, Melancholy Man, And The Tide Rushes In, and It's Up To You sound just as well today as they did back when this album was released. If you like the Moodies, you'll love this album.
B000000WF0|4.0|I think the Verve's final album \\"Urban Hymns\\" from 1997, must be regarded as one of the finest of the early brit-pop movement 1993-97. Lead-singer and main song-writer Richard Ashcroft delivers some outstanding pop-ballads to the album, which sadly became the final. I have not heard their early album in their whole, but it's my impression that this album is significantly different; not as hard-rcoking and more acoustic.<br /><br />The opener and world-wide hit \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" is a great song built up around a string-loop based on the old Rolling Stones song \\"The Last Time\\". Jagger and Richards are also credited as songwriters, which I find very generous of the band, as you have to listen very carefully to notice any similarities to the old Stones song.<br /><br />The other stand-outs on the album are mostly quiet songs with the acoustic guitar and Ashcroft's vocal in front.<br /><br />The brilliant \\"Sonnet\\" belongs to this cathegory; as does the other hit-single off the album \\"The Drugs Don't Work\\" - beautiful and sad. \\"Lucky Man\\" is yet another example.<br /><br />Slightly harder is \\"Space and Time\\" which is melodic and which has a great hook and chorus.<br /><br />\\"Velvet Morning\\" and \\"Good Day\\" are other solid songs.<br /><br />The rest of the album I tend to find slightly forgettable. Some songs simply go on for too long, while others just sound like unnecessasy fillers. Considering the long playingtime of the album (app. 70 minutes ), I think the album would have made a much stronger general impression if some of these tracks had been left out. A big shame if people lose interest before reaching \\"Lucky Man\\" and \\"Velvet Morning\\". Still a great album, though!!
B0000UJDLM|2.0|I saw this movie a long time ago and had forgotten all but the basic plot.  I recently purchased the DVD thinking it would be a fun movie for my younger kids (9, 8, and 6) to watch.  Also, it was rated \\"PG\\" so I thought it would be pretty safe.  I was wrong.  While the plot is innocent enough, the language was atrocious.  I couldn't believe this thing was rated PG and not at least PG-13.  Be advised that if you don't want your kids to hear a lot of cursing throughout a movie, then this is not for you.
0375831002|2.0|I did not  realize this was actually a teen book and was very disappointed in it for a teen as well as myself.  Too drawn out.
0714843377|5.0|I wouldn't buy a Phaidon book expecting some merely inspirational reading. This book is targetet on creative people and it is so beautifully edited that it is worth the price even if your not willing to read it - and reading it should take a day at most as the ideas are objectively presented and there is not much bla bla bla left.<br /><br />for sure you'll have a pleasant time reading it.
0553378384|5.0|Some people do not agree with this book, I personally think it is because they follow a path of strict astrology. With astrology I believe there are two paths: the spiritual and the astrological. This book is 80% about spirituality and 20% about straight down the line astrology. I was amazed at how accurate this book was for me, for members of my family and for my friends, and basically for anyone I have ever known. This is also a very helpful book, it has opened my eyes to the way the people I know think and behave.  <br />Although, I must note one example which might bring to light why some people call this book 'negative' and innacurate. My sister is a gemini with a north node in libra. I am a leo with a north node in gemini. She read gemini instead of libra and believed that gemini was more her, but judging from my perspective of someone who has known her all her life, I think she has more in common with north node libra. Just as when I read leo, it seemed to be an accurate description of myself from the traditional astrology perspective. But after reading my north node it  described my wants and needs, what was important to me, how I dealt with things and it really described the spiritual evolution of the gemini north node. If I was to choose between normal astrology or astrology for the soul, I would without a doubt choose Astrology for the Soul. I think Jan Spiller is an insightful and amazing writer and I would recommend this book to anyone who understands themselves at the core level, at the spiritual level. A highly evolved understanding of spirituality in one self is vital for understanding this book.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|Alanis does the woman scorned bit better.  Songs are all on the same keel; no variety.  Lost power and originality this time around. <br /> <br />Anyone want a slightly used CD?

0792164903|4.0|The writers took the tale and ran with it, losing much of the story along the way.  The names remain the same, but everything else has changed to protect the suspensefullness of the film, except for the horseman losing his head, but even how he lost it is also changed.  Once you get past that, it's a very well done film.  Plot twists abound about who is good and who is evil.  Dark hints that everything is not as it seems crawl in every corner (literally as well as figuratively hard to see hints in dark corners of the room, dark corners of the porch, etc.).  Most people know the Washington Irving story and how it ends (an ambiguous and unsatisfying ending that I never appreciated as a child).  If you knew that story, you wouldn't expect this movie.   <br /> The dark and melodramatic style of the cinematography matches the darkness of the tale.  The special effects are masterfully done, particularly much of what was done with the tree.  Ichabod's obsession with witchcraft is replaced with an obsession with science.  His apparatus are ludicrous, designed to for their visual effect on film rather than having any credible functionality.  The original central theme of brain versus brawn in wooing a woman is gone.  It is replaced by one or more dark secrets held by the town's leading members that binds them together in one or more conspiracies.  Just who is conspiring with whom, and how many of them are involved, all unravels as Ichabod investigates the proliferation of headless bodies that plagues the town. <br /> Most of the key points of the tale remain: Ichabod Crane, Katrina Van Tassel, Old Baltus Van Tassel, Brom Bones, the great tree , the Hessian trooper, the headless horseman, the woman in white, all embedded in an altogether different tale.  I found the ending of the movie more conclusive and satisfying that the ending of the original story.  This is one of the few times I prefer the movie to the \\"book\\".  It's a personal preference.   Though I can appreciate thegenre of that type of short story and how it's written and why it's written that way, I like it less than the movie, just as I prefer a Spatlese Reisling to a single malt scotch.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Longer review: I liked it.  I know some people didn't.  One reviewer said that many of us that did like it were buying into pseudo-intellectual, irony-loving hype.  Whatever.  I wasn't looking for deep meanings, revelations on the philosophy of Proust or Nietzsche, or anything...so I guess I watched it in a \\"non-intellectual\\" sense.<br /><br />I won't describe the whole movie in my review...why read about about my explainations of the characters when that is the point of watching a movie?<br /><br />Simply put, heed the rating (R), watch it, and enjoy it. I think you will.  Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, Kinnear, and that Abigail Breslin are great! They make the the characters real.  Maybe you'll think it's sappy, maybe predictable, maybe cliched, but you should really see it.  You will find yourself wanting to watch it more than once..my true test of a successful dvd purchase!
0156027321|3.0|Martel won in 2002 de Booker Prize met dit boek. De schrijver geeft in de inleiding er blijk van met het aangereikte verhaal over de schipbreukeling Piscine 'goud' in handen te hebben. In een door de tijdgeest gemarkeerde mix van religie (Pi scharrelt rond in het rooms-katholicisme, hindoeisme en islam) en een jongensavontuur (hoe overleef je met een zebra, hyena en een Bengaalse tijfer op een reddingsloep in de Grote Oceaan?). Door dit boek zou je in God gaan geloven, zo claimt Martel, maar dat betwijfel ik. Zoals ook de Japanse onderzoekers aan het eind zo hun twijfels hadden, heb ik dat als lezer ook. Een aantal elementen is te toevallig om waar te zijn en er zit een te duidelijke structuur in het verhaal. Voorbeelden zijn het pas op de 2e dag beschrijven van hoe de boot eruit ziet, het plotselinge landen op een Mexicaans strand na de uitgebreide beschrijving van het 'vleesetende algeneiland' en het opvallend weinig ziek zijn van Pi. Aan karakterontwikkeling of andere roman-elementen ontbreekt het mijns inziens. Gemengde gevoelens dus bij dit wonderlijke boek.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|Damien Rice's follow-up to the phenomental \\"O\\" sees him going in slightly different directions.  This one has a much darker, rawer, edgier feel, and experiments a bit more, as opposed to the huge grandiosity of the previous release.  As such, it's a bit slower to grab your attention (well, mine, anyway), but after a couple of listens, it really started to click.<br /><br />There are a couple of tracks here that may surprise some people.  The first, of course, being \\"Rootless Tree\\", which features repeated use of the f-word.  However, surprising though it may be, I think that it's done in a way so as not to sound crude or gratuitous, and it doesn't detract from the beauty of the song at all.  Rather, it enhances the emotional impact.  This isn't an easy thing to accomplish, but it's done very well here.  The second curve ball is \\"Me, My Yoke, and I\\", a very intense, indie-rockish, generally very un-Damien Rice sounding song.  This one had to grow on me a bit, but it's an excellent and really bizarre song.<br /><br />Elsewhere, there's plenty of more familiar territory. Some nice acoustic ballads, like \\"Grey Room\\", \\"Dogs\\",  and \\"Coconut Skins\\", as well as some excellent piano-driven pieces, like \\"Accidental Babies\\" and the single \\"9 Crimes\\", the latter of which features some stunning vocals from the ever-amazing Lisa Hannigan (when the heck is she gonna make a solo album????).  There's a sort of hidden track, but it's just 10 minutes of ambient noise, so not much to get excited about there (unless of course you're into that kind of thing...).<br /><br />Overall, a pretty solid album.  Not as mind-blowing as \\"O\\", but then, did you really expect it to be that good?  Well either way, don't expect the two albums to sound too much alike.  This is great stuff, but it may take some time to grow on you.  My only real complaint is, well, not enough Lisa (you have no idea how much I freakin' love her voice), otherwise, this is more than worth checking out.<br /><br />(But get \\"O\\" first if you're new to his stuff.)(But get \\"O\\" first if you're new to his stuff.)
0375413405|5.0|A text that should be on every kitchen shelf. Recipe directions are complete and easy to follow. The results have been excellent. Collateral information is interesting and informative. The index is EASY to use.
B000002H70|5.0|This is an album that simply transcends the boundaries of 80's pop, goth, or whatever little label you want to put on it.  The Cure were masters of dark, ambient beauty, and \\"Disintegration\\" is one of the finest albums you can hope to hear.  You might know the single \\"Love Song\\", which of course is great, but it's not really a good example of what to expect.  Most of the other songs here are longer, and more atmospheric (except for \\"Lullaby\\", which has a sort of odd, funky groove).  Each track draws you in with its enveloping, inescapable melodies.  Chief among them is \\"Prayers for Rain\\", with its huge, powerful sense of atmosphere, and perfectly haunting vocals.  It's really just one of those songs you have to hear to believe.<br /><br />And hey, how cool is Robert Smith?  No matter how goofy his hair may have looked back in the day, his voice is just incredible.  Simple yet commanding, sullen and fragile, yet undeniably powerful.  The passion with which he drives these tracks is enough to crush you flat.<br /><br />Now, of course, this album is not for everyone.  There are those that may dismiss it as too slow, too long, too repetitive, or whatever, but oh well.  This is definitely something that requires an attention span, but if you're into this kind of thing, then \\"Disintegration\\" is beyond essential.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Well, you either like the movie, or you don't.  This is one of my favorites, and it's finally out on DVD.  Good quality DVD, with some interesting extras.  For those who know the film, and the history, I won't go into the discrepancies with reality (it is, after all, a 1940's Hollywood film), it's just an enjoyable tale.

0060555661|5.0|Since I am retired and trying to manage my own portfolio, I figured this would be the book to read. I know how to pick 4 or 5 star funds and diversify well enough, but I don't have enough theory or any formal financial background at all. I was looking for a classic book on the subject, one that a financial novice could understand, and decided to read this one.    Benjamin Graham is known as the Father of Value Investing and was the mentor of Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of all time. Warren Buffett called the Intelligent Investor `the best book about investing ever written.'  He believed in defensive, value investing, and famously summarized his philosphy as follows:  \\"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.\\"    I found that `value investing' means that you buy only something that is being sold below its actual value, like buying dollar bills for 40 cents each, he said.  One should take the quantitative (statistical) instead of the qualitative (predictive) approach, since no one can forecast the future anyway. Look at what a security is really worth in a business-like way, just like you would do for any purchase, ignoring what others might think. Do your homework is what he is saying!    According to Graham, almost everybody, me included, does investing wrong. You are supposed to buy low and sell high, but most folks buy when the price is going up and sell when it is coming down. `Mr. Market' is very emotional and encourages stampedes toward whatever looks good at the moment, and away from investments that seem spent. This very act of buying and selling creates updrafts and downdrafts in the market which causes disparity between what the price is and what the price should be for a given investment. Eventually the true value of an investment comes to fore when things settle down.  The maxim he uses for this is: the market is a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run. The investors `vote' for an investment which drives the price up; later, the investors find out what the investment is really worth, and the price settles into it's real value. He cited convincing examples in the tech-bubble era of the late 90's where stock prices ascended to ridiculously high levels and then came crashing down to almost nothing, and their stock shares became like Confederate money, worth only slightly more than the paper they were printed on.    In general, his theory runs counter to the speculative, get-richer-quick investing that seems standard for most of us.  Stay away from gimmicks like market-timing and formula investing (chasing after perceived patterns in the market). Be boring, he says, and go for something steady and sure. Don't try to beat the market; just try to keep up with it.  If you don't want to do the necessary homework, buy index funds. He touts ignored `secondary' or `unsexy' companies, the ones that don't have big names, or ones that produce boring products. It was interesting that when Graham was asked why he was unafraid of losing his edge by proclaiming value investing, he joked that his books are' the most over-read and under-used books on finances ever written'. If, indeed, everyone did value investing, there would be no bargains left out there.  We are talking about something that works, but that no one wants to use!    A cornerstone of the defensive investing philosophy involves building in a good margin of safety by buying investments at as far below actual worth as possible. He also talks a lot about managing risk by patience and self-control; he says: `Don't just do something, stand there!' In some sense, this book is more about the person making the investments than the investments themselves. In essence, if you want to know what risk is, look in the mirror! In other words, it's not about how much risk you can tolerate; it is about howmuch investigation you are willing to do. He mentioned Pascal's Wager as a graphic example of how to think of the consequences when taking on risk - - - if one wagers as to whether God exists or not, he is better off betting He does; otherwise, though the rewards could be a little better, the consequences could be eternally worse! (This was, to me, a fairly heavy-handed but instructive parallel.)    Watch out for the shenanigans of the accountants when you read the financial reports.  Words and phrases like pro-forma, nonrecurring charges, special charges, and good will could be euphemisms for a smoke screen.  I also learned the phrase `kitchen sink accounting', which puts all possible losses into one year, which distorts the picture but gives good tax results for the company. The lesson is to not ignore the footnotes and to read the statements to the end.    Consistent with his philosophy, Graham does not believe in the prevalent Efficient Market Theory (or EMH), which says that investments have the correct prices because there is so much, widespread information readily available on every investment.  He basically believes, and gives many good examples, that the public is not interested in digging into the nuts-and-bolts financial information, but is only interested in what is popular.  In a word, an investor needs to make sure he understands what he is investing in, and make business decisions instead of emotional decisions about it. He says that the finances are really not very complicated, and it's more about character than brain.    The first edition of this book, written in 1950 and was revised several times before Graham died in 1976.  Since it was a little dated as far as market history is concerned, Jason Zweig wrote commentaries on each chapter to bring it into the 21st century.  Graham, as a product of his day, talked mostly about stocks and bonds, and less about funds, and he over-emphasized, in my opinion, the importance of dividends. Zweig says that diversity has replaced value today.  Also, dividends are no big deal today for most investors since the total return (NAV + dividends) is what really matters.  Another thing is that Graham lived through the Depression and saw that it took 25 years (to 1954) for the market to reach the levels of pre-Crash 1929; this might have made him defensive.    I'm glad I read the book. It gave me perspective on how the market works, though I'll still stick with diversity over value, especially since I invest almost entirely in funds. He did not have to scare me off on individual stocks, but he did convince me to do more homework and to try to be more business-like in my financial decisions, and - - - to look in the mirror first.

B00080ZG10|4.0|\\"The Aviator\\" focuses on the brilliant and tragic life of the fascinating madman and genius, Howard Hughes, 1905-1976, (to be precise, 20 years of it, from 1927 when 22 years old Hughes was producing the film \\"Hell's Angels\\" until 1947 when his most famous aircraft, the Hercules was completed). The film is as amazing and dark as the man who called himself with pride, \\"Howard Hughes, the Aviator\\". Cinematography, Art Direction, and Editing were perfect in the almost 3 hours long film that never for a moment seemed too long or boring. Martin Scorsese made a spectacular and dynamic picture and Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction.<br /><br />Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both gave great performances as the corrupted and disgusting Senator Brewster (Alda) and truly memorable Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe, Hughes' enemy and competitor (Baldwin played a delightful villain). Surprisingly for myself, I didn't like very much Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn (I usually love Blanchette in every movie I've seen her) - it seemed more like caricature but it is a matter of personal liking or not.<br /><br />I feel that \\"The Aviator\\" took off the ground like a huge steel bird and took me with it to the marvelous journey. I also believe that \\"The Aviator\\" is much better and more interesting film than that year's Oscar winner - but this is my opinion.

B000B7BRMM|5.0|From someone who owns over twenty Christmas albums, I don't take my Christmas music lightly. Calling this album the BEST Christmas album I've ever heard, therefore, shouldn't be taken as an exaggeration. And, by BEST, I mean the most well thought out (in terms of the songs they include), the best performed (Krall is one of a kind in her genre--she's up there with the big boys), and the best choice to play during Christmas dinner, since, after all, most people will only listen to Christmas albums while they're sitting around eating turkey.  <br />It's subtle and luscious and smooth and it can slip under the radar but it'll touch some notes that'll make you sit up and pay attention.  <br />No more words. The only way to truly appreciate this album is buying it. You won't regret it.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I have been told I am too old for my age as I love the Rat Pack music and American Standards.  This is a great cover of those tunes.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love movies and though I don't see a lot of first run films, I thought 2006 offered an unusual variety of interesting movies and made a special effort to see them in theaters.  Of all the films I saw last year, this is one of the few I felt I would want to see again and so I purchased it on DVD and have watched it a few times since my purchase.  In fact, now that it is being shown on HBO during the holiday season when I have more free time than usual, I have watched it several MORE times--which is very unusual for me.  But this has very quickly become one of my FAVORITE movies. <br /> <br />I am a big Jane Austen fan and loved the Firth/Ehle 1995 production and also the earlier 1980 BBC production with David Rintoul which I used to introduce my daughter to Jane Austen several years ago.  I don't think it's all that relevant to this film to compare it to the TV productions since a TV miniseries can be so much more faithful to the novel itself given much longer playing time and less need for distinctive scenery and sets.  <br /> <br />In order to translate such a social novel successfully to the film screen, and in order to attract a more varied audience than those who faithfully appreciate Masterpiece Theater, dramatic visuals were needed and the sets and scenery took on much greater importance.  Also a much simpler story was imperative to fit in a two hour framework.  The choices made were admirable.  The scenery is so beautiful and so evocative of rural England, the acting is inspired, the dialogue is perfect and the drama moves quickly and holds the interest even of those highly unlikely to pick up and read a Jane Austen novel--even my husband, a comedy and adventure film fan, loves this movie. <br /> <br />I think the relevant group to which this film should be compared are the other big award winners of 2006, and this is a FAR SUPERIOR film to many of the films which won big awards.  I was able to watch 'Walk the Line' a second time, and I HAD to watch 'Syriana' a second time to understand it all--they were both good films and I have to admit I even enjoyed Crash when I first saw it--but I would never bother to watch 'Crash' again, and I think this film gets better each time I see it.  Each time I watch it I see something new in the sets, in the performances, in the story, and in the direction.  I really cannot recommend the film more highly--it is tremendously enjoyable and can be watched by a wide variety of adults as well as older children.

B00005JOCU|5.0|Based on the Broadway musical of the same name - and recommended to anyone with a pulse - DREAMGIRLS tells the story of a 60s-era girl group that rises to national fame after losing an amateur talent contest. Boasting a superstar cast, the film features Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles and Anika Noni Rose and introduces Jennifer Hudson, a shoo-in for the best supporting actress Oscar.<br /><br />When the film begins we meet three teenaged girls as they arrive late for the competition. Wearing drug store wigs and matching sherbet-colored gowns, the Dreamettes are played by pop star Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, American Idol-contestant Jennifer Hudson and Tony Award-winner Anika Noni Rose.<br /><br />Beyonc&eacute; is Deena Jones, a thinly veiled Diana Ross-like character. Slim with a silky voice, Deena perfectly contrasts with Effie White (played by Jennifer Hudson), the big-boned, big-personality lead singer who knows she has the superior, big-time voice. Anika Noni Rose perfectly portrays Lorrell Robinson, the third fiddle. Starstruck, Lorrell is thrilled to be on stage, happy to sing back up and all too willing to accept the role of mistress to James \\"Thunder\\" Early, masterfully played by Eddie Murphy.<br /><br />Backstage the girls meet Curtis Taylor, Jr., a Berry Gordy-like character and wannabe record producer, slickly played by Jamie Foxx. Taylor hires the Dreamettes to sing back up to Early, a performer who is one part James Brown, one part Little Richard and one part Marvin Gaye.<br /><br />After months on the road, Taylor launches the girls as the Dreams, a teenaged trio much like the Supremes. Though the girls are initially thrilled to have an act of their own, their happiness is shattered when Taylor demotes Effie to back up and announces that the more photogenic Deena will be the lead singer.<br /><br />I am surprised that the Effie role is considered a supporting one. The emotional center of the story, Effie is a fascinating character who dominates the film. Not only is her voice truly spectacular, but also her painful struggle drives the plot from start to finish. By contrast the alleged lead role of Deena is nothing more than that of a coat hanger. Gorgeous with the perfect body and face to launch a thousand fashion trends, Deena is also vapid. An easily-manipulated pawn in Taylor's plan to dominate the music industry, she becomes the headlining face of the Rainbow Records look and sound.<br /><br />Worth noting here is the star-power of this truly spectacular cast. I cannot recall seeing this much talent in any film since the Godfather. Not only are these world-class actors, but also all are surprisingly great singers. Even comedic great Eddie Murphy more than holds his own musically as the campy, troubled R&B singer. Denying him an Academy Award for this performance would be criminal.<br /><br />Highly recommended, DREAMGIRLS proves that with a great story, a film featuring an almost exclusively African-American cast can easily capture the hearts of a multicultural audience. I saw this film at a matinee filled with blue-haired white retirees who cheered as the credits rolled.<br /><br />- Regina McMenaminbut also her painful struggle drives the plot from start to finish.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|I think Pirate music by Hans Zimmer is the greatest.  But this is a terrible recording!  I've never seen a CD recorded this poorly. <br /> <br />It is as if the recording engineer was an idiot and set the recording level way to high so that it clips the signal in a very bad way on many of the songs.  Especially during the exciting and emotional loud parts.  It really sucks! <br /> <br />I'd pay anything to get a good recording of these great songs! <br /> <br />Does anyone have any ideas of how to get such? <br /> <br />
B00005JPDJ|4.0|The idea of house-swapping is a great set-up for comical action.  Add to that, beautiful scenery and endearing characters and you've got a fun and touching movie.<br /><br />It's very well made - and the icing on the cake is the attempt made to steer clear of stereotypical plot lines.  I was kept guessing as to what would happen next, which is refreshing and unusual for a film of this type.<br /><br />Jack Black, as usual, is great, showing his usual comical charm.<br /><br />Only criticism I have was there appeared to be a bias towards Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.  More of the movie seemed to follow their adventures (due to their star appeal no doubt).  I wondered, several times, what's Jack and Kate up to?<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film - not only is it funny and moving as you expect a good romantic comedy to be, but it has fresh and unexpected plot twists that keep you interested as well as satisfied.
B000J103OI|3.0|Well I read the book (don't know if I gain or lose points for admitting that) and the movie is nothing like it:  the Andrea of the book, miserable and incompetent, never stopped believing the job was beneath her.  I guess I can see why the movie would change such an unpleasant character to one we're supposed to root for, but the shift tilts the movie toward the worn-out plot of the girl choosing between Demanding Job and Life.  It could have been any job.  That it happened to be a job in fashion is significant only because it allowed us to see the characters in many beautiful outfits, which is really the only plus in watching the movie.  Other than that, all the usual marks are hit:  girl gives more and more to demanding job, to the chagrin of her ragamuffin buddies; girl excels at job and dismisses whiny boyfriend, who insists he prefers her old, raggedy self; girl goes \\"Stockholm\\" and begins empathizing with her evil boss/captor; girl has obligatory Who-Am-I? soulful stare into mirror; girl has chance at advancement but tosses it all away to get back to real self.  You've seen it before, I promise.

0670032506|2.0|I am a loyal follower of Getting Things Done (GTD) and have been using the system for almost 3 years.  That being said, I was dissapointed in this book in that it is too \\"spiritual\\" and \\"mindful\\" at least for me.  Most people that I know that use GTD are more process driven type people and do not really want to read about the \\"fluffy\\" stuff because most of it is common sense.  The hard part is coming up with a system like GTD to actually have a framework with which to process information. Therefore, I highly recommend Mr. Allen's first book \\"Getting Things Done\\" if you are having trouble keeping up with the inflow of information we receive in this modern age.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie has it all:  a complex message that reminds us that all governments are answerable to the people they serve.  In one swipe, the story forces thoughts about everything from the Patriot Act to the Count of Monte Cristo, from Nathan Hale to Nazi Germany.  It reminds us that our forefathers were no better (and no worse) than \\"V\\" and his side-kick Evey.  It's both a thinking man's script and an adrenaline junkie's fix.  Buy it, if only to remind yourself that one man's terrorist is another man's patriot.  Watch it with your kids and you'll have some great discussion about the virtue of this film.  For once I've firmly decided upon my Halloween costume next year...
B000001GXJ|5.0|All too many opera fans of a particular composer content themselves with the most popular of that composer's works. Thus it is difficult to geet a Bellini fan to venture beyond Norma or to get a Donizetti fan to go beyond Lucia di Lamermoor.  Many Verdi fans will not go beyond Trav-Trov-Rig and Aida.  This is a shame.  All of these composers wrote many operas and there is hardly a bad one in the bunch.  Simon Boccanegra has some of the most exciting music Verdi wrote, and this item boasts one of the finest all-star casts that could possibly be assembled.  Forget what people say about the plot.  Most opera plots are terribly contrived.  An opera is about music.  If you are a fan of Verdi and have not ventured farther than the standars, do yourself an immense favor and buy this edition of Simon Boccanegra.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Kate Winslet stars. Peter Jackson directed. And it turns out that the woman Winslet portrays, Juliet Hulme, grew up to be fiction writer Anne Perry. In 1950s New Zealand two teenage girls, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, are drawn together by a fantasy world they create. The movie includes claymation of the fantasy world. The girls become close friends and, over the course of two years, eventually lovers. They continue seeing each other after their families forbid it and step in to separate them. They eventually murder Pauline's mother to prevent the separation. The movie ends there, but they were sentenced to prison and served five years. It's an amazing movie, and shows how obsessive relationship can get out of hand.

Sergeant Neil Howie, of mainland Scotland, is sent an anonymous letter recommending that he investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, on the island of Summerisle. He discovers that the entire population follows a neo-pagan cult under the island's owner Lord Summerisle, believing in re-incarnation, worshipping the sun and engaging in fertility rituals and sexual magic in order to appease immanent natural forces. After much detective work and more pagan fun, it is revealed that the girl is alive and unhurt. The letter was part of a ploy to bring Howie to the island for him to be the sacrifice, which the islanders believe will restore the fertility of their orchards.

This time, Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, two cool guys team up as Tango and Cash to give good entertainment on a boring saturday night. <br /> <br />So what do you get when buying this dvd? Two muscular fellows who give funny oneliners and shoot up a lot of bad guys. Big guns, big cars, big explosions, this film has it all. Sylvester Stallone acts good and gives a nice performance as the good cop Ray Tango. I can now see why he was the first one considered to play Axel Foley in \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\".  <br />Kurt Russell plays Gabrielle Cash, the tough, bigmouthed cop who is the almost opposite of Tango. He is funny and just as cool as Stallone.  <br />Also in the mix is a sexy young Teri Hatcher playing Tango's sister. This was one of her first big films and she stays firmly on her feet next to Stallone and Russell. <br /> <br />The story is simple, but nice: Tango and cash are two rival cops who are the absolute best. They solve one crime right after the other. Now you can understand that the criminals aren't very happy with that, so: they set the two cops up. Now, Tango and Cash are put into jail for a crime they didn't commit. They can't stand each other, but they have to work together trying to escape out of the jail and finding the ones responisble for setting them up.  <br /> <br />So nothing original or special, but who cares? It entertains perfectly. Expect having a fun time seeying two of the coolest actors of the 80's, Stallone and Russell, team up as Tango and Cash, fighting bad guys with big guns and nice oneliners.  <br />Good popcorn fun.

B000IAZPKM|3.0|First off, let me say that I love Kamelot's music.  The Black Halo is one of the best 5 prog/power metal albums of all time.  I was anxiously awaiting this DVD and while it is good on several levels, I was very disspointed in the mix of the music vs. the vocals.  Roy Khan's voice is too far back in the mix (especially in the first half of the DVD).  For several of the first few songs it is pretty hard to hear him.  While I tend to find the mix between vocals and music typically bad in concert (which I'll never understand), I've always been of the understanding that a mix issue like this can be fixed in producing a DVD.  Not sure if it can, but if so, they really blew it in not making his voice more pronounced in the mix.  For those that know Kamelot, Roy Khan's voice is a big part of why we listen to them.  To drown his voice out is a travesty as it diminishes the best part of Kamelot.   <br /> <br />I don't mean to infer this is a terrible DVD.  By most objective standards, it's very good.  I was just very dissappointed given how much I like Khan's voice.  If you like Kamelot, I'd still recommend the DVD as it is better than 99% of other bands, but just be prepared to be a bit dissapointed in the ability to enjoy Khan's voice.

B00005JL0I|1.0|I have never been a Peter Sellers fan, so I may be biased, but I found this \\"original\\" version of Casino Royale to be the worst film I have ever seen.  For production values, as well as ridiculousness, it is on a par with \\"Towering Inferno,\\" although TI wasn't intended to be comedic, so I have to rate that one even lower. <br /> <br />When I hear the word spoof, a film like \\"Airplane\\" comes to mind.  Or \\"The Brady Bunch Movie.\\"  Both of those movies made me laugh to the point of tears, and I can watch them over and over and still get hearty laughs.  On the other hand, I don't think I got much more than a chuckle or two out of \\"Casino Royale.\\"  I'm shocked that the latest \\"real\\" James Bond film used the same title - anything that draws attention to this sorry excuse for a movie can only be detrimental to the James Bond franchise. <br /> <br />Silliness is not a substitute for comedy writing.  And this picture overflows with silliness.  In fact, I'd put it on a par with the old \\"Batman\\" tv series of the 60s, which had the same level of bizarre silliness.  At least Batman had a likeable hero character in Adam West.  This movie just made me want to wretch.  There is nothing even remotely likeable about any of the characters. <br /> <br />I assume there are a few people who really like this film, and that's something I'll never comprehend, but they say the French love Jerry Lewis, so I guess there's no accounting for taste!
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Many have complained that this film is too long or that it has too much sappy substance to it, but that's what makes this film a STORY.  Obviously, if you're not into the whole star-crossed lover bit then this film is not for you.  However, I think that James Cameron did an excellent job of incorporating the story of Rose&Jack (or Kate&Leo) into one of history's most tragic events.  Both of these actors really came into their roles and the acting was extremely convincing.  They made the plot seem beautiful, intriguing and worthwhile, whereas many other actors could have easily made it seem cheesy, sappy and a waste of time.   <br /> <br />As far as the movie being too long...what would you prefer?  That James Cameron take his budget and film a two-hour film of a sinking ship?  The point of the film is not to recapture what happened on the Titanic.  Everybody is already well aware of that.  The point is to introduce a new element into it; the story of Rose and Jack.  This is what makes the film worthwhile.  Again, if you're into action and little emotional substance in a film, then this beautiful drama is not for you.   <br /> <br />For what it is, I think Titanic is an excellent movie.  Every moment in the film is spent building a very well thought out plot.  Sure, you know how it's going to end, but that isn't the point.  Sit back and enjoy what James Cameron has given us: a masterpiece that will stand the test of time and is to date the highest grossing box-office movie.  I think that speaks for itself.
0143036556|4.0|A virtually forgotten, but very good philosopher once commented that hypotheses derived by the inductive method, that is observation and experimentation, never can be proven absolutely, but are only as good as the last observation. ( Karl Popper,\\"The Logic of Scientific Discovery', Amazon.com). The reader would be well advised to keep this comment in mind when reading this book by Jared Diamond.<br /><br />\\"Collapse\\", not counting an introductory section, consists of two parts. The first and most fascinating section consists of Diamond's observations of societies that consciously or unconsciously made life choices that either led to their destruction or long term survival. His account of the successes and failures of various Norse and Polynesian societies is especially fascinating. He chronicles very accurately how the fate of a number of societies was directly related to their abilities to sustain their environments, to adapt to changing conditions, and their awareness of their surroundings. It is difficult to fault his observations and conclusions on the good and bad fates of these societies.<br /><br /> The second part of the book is more problematic. Diamond attempts to formulate a hypothesis to predict the success or failure of societies based on a five point framework derived from his observations of societies outlined in the first section. It is not clear that this formulation necessarily really holds true for all human societies all the time. Clearly a sustainable environment is indispensable for a stable and successful social structure. Yet this reviewer remains unconvinced that Diamond's hypothesis alone will ever be an effective tool to predict the success or failure of all societies regardless of other variables.<br /><br />Still this book is well worth reading. Diamond is a wonderful writer and an acute observer. The reader can learn a great deal from this book and have an enjoyable read in the process.

0440419514|5.0|Like most children's literature, this trilogy is so enjoyable and tangible that kids and grown-ups alike will become entangled in the world of Lyra and her companions.  The books are captivating and dark, and the allegory of religion is prevalent.  You should read books to enjoy them, but also to learn from them.  I think Pullman does an incredible job of weaving together characters and plot with a message that causes you to think even after the world of the books is over.  There are messages about faith, love, trust, instinct, and human nature that appeal to the curious mind.  That's something special and makes this trilogy worth reading.<br /><br />I recommend these books to anyone who enjoys fantasies.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Another great album from Iron Maiden! Since Bruce & Adrian reunited with the rest of Maiden a few years ago, it seems the musicial ideas really evolve and congeal from their early days to now. The material on this album is stronger I think than on Dance of Death and is on par with Brave New World. Being a guitarist myself, I'm happy to hear them using more of the twin guitar thing than the last two albums, and I can only hope it grows from there to be comparable to the days of Piece of Mind and Powerslave.<br /><br />My only complaint is that a few of the numbers on this work can sound disjointed at times, like they started writing one motif, stopped, and decided to go in a completely different direction with the song, as if they were trying to become more prog-rocky with it and not quite getting there. Sometimes, it works really well, but other times, its a little flat. Unlike past tracks, like Wasted Years, where they'll have a great intro, go into the song, and revisit it cohesively some point later in the song, there were a couple of tracks where they'll have a cool intro, and that will be the only time you'll hear it and never come back to it, or it will be a slow, clean guitar intro that leads into a rocked-out song, and half way through the song they put on the brakes and stop dead to play that intro again, making it sound disjointed (if the drums & bass had something to go with it, it would've flowed better).<br /><br />Overall there are some great tracks on this album. I recommend \\"A Different World\\", \\"These Colours Don't Run\\", and \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\", the last of which actually had local radio play here in Detroit when it came out! For a little more old school Maideny sound, give \\"The Legacy\\" and \\"Lord of Light\\" a spin, and \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" has a \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" feel to it at times.<br /><br />DIEHARD MAIDEN FANS, the ones who've stuck with them through the good times (80's and early 90's) and the not so good times (Blaze Bailey) will like this album. If you're looking for \\"Run to the Hills\\", you're not going to find it here. Move along Sunny Jim.like this album. If you're looking for \\"Run to the Hills\\", you're not going to find it here.

B00005RHGK|1.0|And the award, for the worst horror movie of all time goes to...\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" OK, I wasnt expecting much when I saw this film, but I didnt expect to watch something that made absolutly no sense. If you like movies with no plots or character development, espically about the lead character then Jeepers Creepers is right up your alley. The movie actually starts off very cool. A brother and sister are on a highway out in the middle of no where, when some maniac tries to run them off the road. They come across this maniac a few minutes later stuffing a body down a sewer pipe, and then they decide to go and check out the scene. What awaits at the bottom of the pipe is creepy indeed, and I thought that this was going to be one hell of a movie. But I was tricked and fooled, because in the next hour, the movie goes from looking like its going to be a sick and twisted thriller to a laughing stock. IF you have seen the movie, read ahead, as they are SPOILERS listed below. IF you havent seen the movie, read anyway, so you can save yourself an hour and a half of your life doing something more productive, like watching the grass grow. Here is a list of what is completely wrong with this movie.<br /><br />1.When the teens reach the diner, they get a strange call from a women who knows both their names. It is later reveled that this women is a pyschic who can predict the future through her dreams. She explains that the teens will be at a house later full of cats, and when they here the songs \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" to watch out. OK, this is completly stupid. If the women wanted to warn the teens they were in trouble, she should have explained who she was (which she never revels on the phone) and told them they were in great danger and to get out of town. Case closed.<br /><br />2.When the killer is finally reveled he looks he a stupid demon with wings. He looks like the goblin from Spider Man....Ughhh<br /><br />3.When the women (the pyschic) finally reaches the teen at the policestation, she revels who she is, what she sees, and a brief, story, that makes no sense of who this demon is. This is what really kills the movie since we really have no idea of who the demon is and what is his motives about why he kills are. Instead we get some garbage story about how he feeds on humans to stay alive. Sounds like a vampire to me.<br /><br />4.THE ENDING SUCKS...The demon is in his sewer pipe listening to Jeepers Creepers and there is one of the teens (the guy) standing there with it seems like the life is sucked out of him. It looks like a cardboard cut out with the eye missing and then the demon pears through the eye, and fade to black, movie over. I am sitting here puzzled as I just watched a movie that gave me nothing about the identity of the killer, expect it likes to feed on humans..Wonderful. I have seen low budget B-Horror movie that were better then this, and yes I mean slasher films that have more plot then this. Avoid this movie. You arent missing anything here. If the writer wanted to make a movie that was confusing and had intentions of making you use your head about what the demon really was, then he needed a much more polished script, that give you a sense of what really could be happening. It just never happens.

If your not an Eagles fan, you still need to see / hear this production to believe what can be done.  The only downside to this DVD is that others just don't sound as good just after playing this one.

After having \\"Dynamite\\" in the collection for 3 weeks, I have come the conclusion that this album is a worthy continuation of the Jay Kay saga.  If you are a die hard fan, I think you'll find it hard to rate the album above \\"A Funk Odyssey\\" and \\"Synkronized\\" but probably right on par.      GIVE YOURSELF TIME for this album to grow on you...
B000002552|5.0|A lot of big hardcore fans are up in arms about the incompleteness and misrepresentation of The Basement Tapes.  I'm a big fan, but I'm not hardcore.  I'd love to hear the complete Tapes, but mostly I'm just happy that I have these CD-quality versions to listen to.  These songs are a great snapshot of Dylan's reaction to the public's insatiable desire for serious music and an essential step in The Band's evolution from The Hawks, to Dylan's backing band, to their own unique animal.<br /><br />It's great to hear Dylan and the boys having a good time, and I don't really mind if the songs are half-baked--the playing is top notch, and the fun they're having is infectious.  Songs like \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" and \\"Please Mrs. Henry\\" reflect Bob's still razor-sharp skill with lyrics, but also his humor which hadn't been this straight-up since his early albums (before the expectations).  The Band shines as back-up, with Garth Hudson, as usual, providing the most accomplished accompaniment, with Richard Manuel and Rick Danko chiming in with gorgeous harmonies.<br /><br />The Band's solo recordings (likely later interpolations) are good, but not as shining as their collaborations with Dylan.  Still, \\"Katie's Been Gone\\" is ear candy, as is the unusually listenable Robertson vocal on \\"Bessie Smith.\\"  On the other hand, Dylan singing later Band hits like \\"Tears of Rage\\" and \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\" is pretty interesting, but it's hard to let go of the amazing definitive versions The Band cut on Music From Big Pink.  A couple other great classics are \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\" and \\"Nothing Was Delivered,\\" (brilliantly covered by The Byrds on [[ASIN:B000002AHB Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]).<br /><br />All in all, The Basement Tapes may not be complete or historically accurate, and it might not be as weighty or serious as Dylan's earlier work, but it's a heck of a lot of fun and a pleasure that I have repeatedly enjoyed listening to.  Maybe someday we'll get the rest . . .
B000005JA8|5.0|Trout Mask Replica catches a lot of flak from a lot of people--many claim it's pretentious, and that only rock snobs (pretend to) enjoy it.  I'm of the opinion that the people who are pretentious and snobby are the people who think they're too good/cool to try something, which seems to be people detracting from this record.  Either way, it's still around as a quite popular item (lots of reviews for such an old album), so I think that very fact says something about its influence, good or bad.  For these reasons, I decided to give it a try, with the attitude that it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but that there are some definite redeeming qualities that make it worth listening to.  As it turns out, that was definitely the case.<br /><br />Trout Mask Replica is, as most people have labeled it, a tumultuous fusion of delta blues, electric rock guitar, dissonance, crazy rhythms and nonsense lyrics sung in intense voices that range from guttural howls to high-pitched cartoony voices.  If you think it sounds bizarre, you're right.  No matter how impenetrable and thrown-together it sounds, most elements of the album are pretty calculated.  Perhaps it was even Beefheart's intention to make a record that would revolt some people and really turn some on (we're playing right into his hands, in that case).<br /><br />Take any one element of the combination alone and it makes a lot more sense--most songs have 2 guitars playing wild, dissonant lines.  If you isolate them and listen to them individually, there's some pretty gnarly blues and rock riffs going, with some pretty impressive chops involved.  Thing is, they're layered on top of each other and often don't line up.  Likewise, Beefheart's lyrics don't make much sense on the outside, but if you get past the unorthodox imagery and style he uses, you can tell he's getting at some pretty interesting themes, like one of my favorites, \\"My Human Gets Me Blues,\\" which has some interesting takes on religion, and the up-front political commentary of \\"Dachau Blues.\\"  Then again, many of the songs are straight up nonsense, like \\"Old Fart At Play.\\"  Obviously, Beefheart's vision for a prickly but worthwhile album also includes a healthy dose of humor.  Another of my faves is \\"Orange Claw Hammer,\\" which sounds like an a cappella drunken pirate singalong.<br /><br />All in all, it's not as incoherent as a lot of people want to think it is.  It's certainly not music I'd like to put on as background at an intimate party, but there's a lot to get out of the lyrics, music and humor it has to offer.  It's also a great deal--a double album contained on one CD crammed full of sound.  It may not be your favorite, but you don't really have anything to lose by checking it out.t political commentary of \\"Dachau Blues.\\"  Then again, many of the songs are straight up nonsense, like \\"Old Fart At Play.\\"  Obviously, Beefheart's vision for a prickly but worthwhile album also includes a healthy dose of humor.

B0000033IS|5.0|Worth checking out on the merit of transcendent hit \\"Respect\\" alone, \\"I Never Loved A Man The Way I Loved You\\" is one of my favorite soul albums for three main reasons: Aretha's voice, of course, the ripping backing band she's got, and the songs.<br /><br />Anyone with a radio has probably heard Aretha belt out \\"Respect\\" and other hits, but checking out an entire album really enhanced my appreciation of her  remarkable voice.  Her range and power are extraordinary, and to think of her pounding the keys while singing out her anguish and happiness really makes the album magic.  Her lively wailing on \\"Drown in My Own Tears\\" is soaked in authenticity, and her sultry readings of the title track and \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" make it a surprisingly steamy affair.  It's great to hear Aretha pour her sweat, heart, and guts into these songs and hear the soft, hard, fiery and sweet sounds her voice is capable of.<br /><br />The backing band is tight and spot on--there's some really gnarly blues guitar, for instance, on the title track, and \\"Save Me\\" doesn't drop a funk-soaked beat.  Throughout the whole album, the saxes and brass shine and accentuate the spaces between Aretha's confessions, illustrating the soul truth that simple is powerful.  The background singers also help support Aretha's power with soft harmonies (like on the jazzy \\"Don't Let Me Lose This Dream\\").<br /><br />Last, the songs are stupendous.  Not only does Franklin conquer Otis Redding's \\"Respect\\" and cut the definitive version, she also reimagines Sam Cooke's \\"Good Times\\" and gives the man a run for his money on her tender reading of \\"A Change is Gonna Come.\\" Along the way, she also manages to make soul classics out of a few other songwriters' tunes (\\"Do Right Woman\\") AND co-write some soul classics of her very own.  Serious business indeed.<br /><br />I love this CD and listen to it all the time--no matter how radio-overplayed \\"Respect\\" is, this album still glitters with the magic that created it and remains part of the bedrock of my modest soul collection.part of the bedrock of my modest soul collection.

B000E5N62U|2.0|Morph the Cat is a well-crafted album that is slick, in fact, too slick. So slick that it slicks itself out of the action. It is really nothing more than Muzak for bankers as they drive their German cars or for WAGS (mindless wives of overpaid sportstars) doing shopping training in Malls. <br /> <br />I couldn't find any common ground between the album's performers and me the listener. <br /> <br />The album is over produced with cliché guitar, brass and keyboard stuff. Though, I did like the bass playing. No risks are taken on this album. If one wanted to provide a stark review of life in New York then engage the listener with wit and intellect. Fagen either talks down to his audience or preaches to his disciples. As an English fella, such an album would be used as a beer mat over here. Even by those who listened to Ricky Don't Lose That Number whilst they fixed their motorbikes in the early 1970's, all those years ago. <br /> <br />The production quality loses all sincerity of the vocals. It's as if every word was phonetically tailored to fit the into a concept. Unlike Jazz where freedom prevails with the charm of mistake and improvisation captured as a one-time rendition. Jazz has no analysis, it happens. Not this pap, tortured priggishness squeezed out of a mind suffering from manic depression. <br /> <br />I suggest Mr. Fagen goes out into the real world and gets a proper job. This is nothing but fictional music. Complete bollix. You would be better off trawling the backwaters of YouTube for musical inspiration. <br />

The music is taken from several concert given in 2001 and 2002. Overall, it's worth watching many times.
B0009X7664|5.0|I bought this to watch with my 9 and 6 year old. I remembered it from my childhood and knew it would be a thought provoking movie that I could discuss moral delemas with my kids as well as look at a change in times from how we live vs. how others have lived. It displays the simple life where kids had to entertain themselves and use there imagination, which of course got them into trouble now and then. Of course the movie expressed the obvious racial problems of the day that no child today should take for granted. Other not so subtle issues involve domestic and alcohol abuse. In the real world we cannot protect our children from these things entirely but we can try to teach them to make the right decisions vs. the easy way out and this movie is but one introduction to such lessons.  Of course you have to have kids old enough but not too old to sit for a black and white movie. I think my kids realized that B & W doesn't always represent a boring old movie after this one.
0786177284|5.0|Todd, who sounds nothing like Feynman, brings easy to listen to enthusiam and wonderment to this magnificent story.   <br /> <br />Feynman, just the single name carries the legend of this Nobel winning genius. However, the real story is the breadth of his interests and adventures. Independent thinker, he could probably have done the Challenger study alone and delivered a more useful product. His insights are priceless.  <br /> <br />The other side is his unscientific pursuit of women. The romantic vs the reality. He studies the few single ladies available in the area of the remote nuclear labs with the same approach he took to training the ants in his room to march in a semi-circle and out the door. However, his heart and his science seem to be in eternal conflict in the romantic arean.  <br /> <br />Feynman travels to Brazil and ends up learning to  make music with one of the hundreds of ghetto bands. Later he sits on the board that selects textbooks for California students where he is a solo voice for quality books and integrity in the acquisition process.   <br /> <br />The story is told in a manner that is ageless and suitable for listeners of all ages. A wonderful gift for a young student wondering if scientists have any fun. For all ages the book is positive, inspirational without preaching and a joy. Highly recommended
B000G8NXZK|4.0|What can I say about Brazil that hasn't already been said. Yes this may be a difficult movie for some to understand, but it is well worth the time.<br /><br />While I was thrilled with the extras included by Criterion with this release, I was disappointed as well. The feature about the problems with the US release of the film were informative and entertaing. I also enjoyed the studios hack job to redesign the film for US release.<br /><br />However, I had hoped for a bit more, while the transfer of the film was good, I had hoped that the audio would have been remixed to Dolby Digital 5.1 as least, considering the cost.<br /><br />Still all in all this is an excellent film and a must for any collection
B000J2DAYM|2.0|I thought this movie looked cool from the preview, but it was a bit of a bore.  I had a vague idea of what the director was going for, but it just wasn't there.  Film noir meets John Hughes. The female lead is intoxicating, however.   <br /> <br />Not worth the four bucks.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|KISSology Vol. 1, 1974-1977 shows just what a powerhouse of a band KISS was in the early days.  Peter Criss and Ace Frehley - who later became liabilities in the band musically - were in top form in this period.  Peter plays with reckless abandon, and Ace plays with style and flair.  This also happens to show that their earliest material (from their first 3 albums) was arguably their strongest up until Revenge in 1992.<br /><br />The concerts in this set are shows that have been widely bootlegged, but the bootlegs were of poor audio and video quality, and here they are shows in the best possible quality.  Sadly, a couple of the original master tapes have some deterioration (Cobo Hall, 1976 especially), but it's never all that bad, and the imperfections in the original master tape never last that long.<br /><br />It's interesting to see the KISS stage show deveop from the very early days until the \\"peak\\" on the Love Gun tour.  They keep adding to the stage set, and it gets bigger and bigger until you see what made the band's reputation back in 1976/1977.<br /><br />The TV appearances are nice bonuses, and the \\"easter eggs\\" are fantastic lost gems, too.<br /><br />All in all, exactly the set most KISS fans wanted.  If they can release further volumes as comprehensive as this one (hopefully no eras will be left out - they need to include the Hot In The Shade tour, and the Revenge tour as well on future releases) then KISS fans will finally have the concert collection that they've requested from the band for years.
B00070DK14|3.0|In the same category than Stormwatch, some good tracks like Beastie, Broadsword, and Flying Color. The rest is so-so, not a classic, far away from Thick as or Aqualung.
B00005JPDP|5.0|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, is a darkly beautiful and amazing story of the man whose nose knew \\"all the smells in the world\\".  He travels through life with a strange sense of detachement, mentally handicapped in the sense that he knows neither love nor how to receive it.  Instead, he focuses his attention on the one thing that was ever present in his life, his gift, or perhaps curse, his extraordinary sense of smell.  <br /> <br />He uses it to pursue his goal to keep smell, so that such exquisite scent will never disappear again, from his experience with a beautiful redhead that sold plums on the streets.   <br /> <br />I can hardly explain how amazingly done this movie is.  The camera shots are gorgeous, when he smelled flowers, you smelled flowers, and are overwhelmed by them on the screen along with dazzling music. <br /> <br />Some of the scenes can be a little strange, with a great deal of nudity.  I know this is more generally accepted in European countries, but most people in the US were turned off by some of the scenes, particularly one at the end, that contains, no less than 5000 nude men and women fondling one another.  Very odd.  But at the same time, it suits the fairy tale like story, and is easily undertood to be the consequences of when one human being is as gifted as our main character, with the ability to create something no one else has ever done before.  <br /> <br />I really hope this movie gets the attention and credit it deserves.  It's a work of art.

068987474X|4.0|So, like most girls, I thought that this would be another one of those very obvious books for stupid girls who are completely oblivious to the actual quality of their personal relationships, but THEN there was a chapter that applied to me, and I think that's how this book resounds with most women. <br /> <br />The book starts with simple small things that guys don't do, indicating their disinterest. Things such as not asking a girl out, not calling, not dating, not having sex, then it builds to the more obvious things like if a man's married to someone else, having sex with someone else, has disappeared or is a selfish jerk. <br /> <br />Throughout, greg behrendt and liz tuccillo provide humorous and identifiable commentary on the things women put up with to get what they think they want. The overall tone is very positive and a definite self esteem booster. Excellent ladies deserve excellent men, and we shouldn't settle, no matter the circumstances.

0375703764|3.0|This book intrigued, amused, delighted and annoyed me all at once.

B000GIXEIG|4.0|A classic tale of man vs. monster is re-told with great skill in this movie. When the hairy little troll, Grindel, loses his father to some blood-thirsty Danes, a wound is opened in the younster's heart that will never heal. When Grindel grows to manhood he seeks revenge on the men responsible for his father's death, collecting their heads to lay before the decomposed skull of 'Papa' that the troll keeps in a cave. One can't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for the troll. Then Beowulf and his brave men are asked to aid King Hrothgar by killing the troll, but Beowulf discovers that the Danish King hasn't told him the entire story and isn't blameless in the troll's carnage. The scenery in the film is lovely and the re-told version of this legend is well done.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

B000EQ47HC|5.0|I'll get some argument on this, but had Boston been more productive, instead of releasing only five studio albums in thirty years, they'd be considered one of America's greatest bands. I saw Boston in concert - with Fran Cosmo and Kimberly Dahme - three years ago and they've still got it. Tom Scholtz, the boy genius who pulled a 4.8 out of 5.0 at MIT, can shred metal as good as anyone, but Boston is so much more than that. Better guitarists surely exist, but when it comes to the purity and precision of a Boston mix, there are few competitors. Obviously, I love the band, so I was thrilled when \\"Don't Look Back\\" as well as the self titled debut album were remixed in 24 bit- versus the original 16 bit - and released last year. The sound is crisp, Brad Delp's soaring vocals move from a muddy background to front and center, and each carefully crafted guitar part is given the perfect place on the sound spectrum.    I believe that Boston can be forgiven its lack of productivity when the quality of the product is considered. If DaVinci had done only five paintings - instead of nineteen - we'd still think they were pretty good.     If you are an MP3 junkie, don't waste your money. You won't appreciate the improvement in the recording. But if you still believe in high end audio reproduction - an Onko system, say - the CD is a must have,  and you will surely toss your old 16 track into the recycle bin. Enjoy.

0307346609|2.0|I love the premise and it's not a terrible book, but it's just not worth the effort to finish. I've read about half of the book so far, and here's what I think.    First, it's supposed to be an \\"oral history,\\" right? I have no problem with that. It's broken up into a bunch of 3-4 page vignettes. I have no problem with that. But, it's either an oral history or it's not. There are a few vignettes that really read like an oral history, but most are just stories written first person. I mean, complete novel-style writing, little to no interaction with the interviewer, just a teensy story from the first person.    Second, it's the politics. He doesn't knock you over the head with it, but it's pervasive enough. It seems like World War Z is his liberal Jewish fantasy. I have nothing against liberals or Jews (I'm a big supporter of Israel) but what, exactly, is the bigger fantasy-- that the dead come to life, or that the one nation who foretells the disaster is Israel, and their solution is to withdraw from all their settlements, withdraw from Jerusalem, and open their borders to all Palestinian refugees, most of whom are too foolish and suspicious to actually take up Israel on their offer? The Bush bashing is very subtle and, frankly, acceptable, but it's there nonetheless. Now I'm reading some chapter about recreating FDR's New Deal--        \\"If my father had been alive, he probably would have laughed at my frustration. He'd been a staunch New dealer, working closely with FDR as comptroller of New York State. He used methods that were almost Marxist in nature, the kind of collectivization that would make Ayn Rand leap from her grave and join the ranks of the living dead. I'd always rejected the lessons he'd tried to impart, running as far away as Wall Street to shut them out. Now I was wracking my brains to remember them.\\"    The upper class survivors are all, to a man, completely worthless and unskilled in the \\"new\\" economy, and are retrained by the blue collar masses todo the things they couldn't-- fantastically ridiculous things like repairing houses and having gardens. I can see the point-- there are few machinists and gunsmiths, that would be a real problem and is a great thing to add. But to him, it's the entire upper class that is completely worthless:    \\"You should have seen some of the 'careers' listed on our first employment census; everyone was some version of an 'executive,' a 'representative,' an 'analyst,' or a 'consultant'...The first labor survey stated clearly that over 65 percent of the present civilian workforce were classified F-6, possessing no valued vocation...In short, we needed to get a lot of white collars dirty...Anyone F-6 but physically able became unskilled labor: clearing rubble, harvesting crops, digging graves.\\"    If there had been any contrary stories so far, to give the impression that these were just survivor opinions and not the author's, I might have been able to finish it, but there haven't and I really don't have any faith that there will be at this point.

B0002KQNJU|4.0|This film was a great spoof, with pretty good performances by Jack McGowran and Roman Polanski, and a very good music score that really pulls you into the mood of the piece. I had previously seen a shorter edited version which was confusing and not well paced, so it's refreshing to see the movie in a longer form and more complete. This movie has to have one of the all-time funniest gay vampires. A must-see just for that.
B000IOM0WE|1.0|I didn't like the movie itself but was intrigued by Charlize (hehehe...) when I saw a bit of this film at my friend's house, on regular DVD.  So I rented the Blu-ray version from Netflix as soon as I got my Playstation 3.  I was totally unimpressed by the digital quality of the transfer.  (I still didn't like the film -- nothing original in this at all and the acting sucks big time.)  I couldn't tell it was in hi-def, and the audio part is lame, too.

0553103547|3.0|This is the first book of the massive series A Song of Ice and Fire, and as expected it is mostly an introduction the series.  Many threads are left unfinished; in fact only one thread really reached a climax, and it closed the book. This bothered me, as I read an 800 page book and felt like there was no satisfaction from the work in reading the massive volume. Other than that gripe, this is good storytelling. It's not filled with a lot of excitement like Stephen Erikson's books, as its more character and story development, that is similar to the style that Stephen King has mastered. In fact it felt like I was reading Insomnia by Stephen King, but in a fantasy setting, where there was some unbelievable character development, but really not a lot going on. With good storytelling the fault is always chapters that you question why they are even in the book? But as you get to the end of the story, you realized those little chapters really gave the reader a better understanding of the character and/or story. So it moves slowly, but it is worth it.<br /><br />So far with the first book I have not seen the excitement that this series garners, but I do see the intelligence in his writing. His character development as mentioned is top notch!<br /><br />But this is standard fantasy fare, and even has the clich&eacute; dragons *shakes head*, although they do not really make an appearance, you only hear about them. If you have read Stephen R. Donaldson's Mordant's Need, then you'll know what to expect with this book. A Game of Thrones is aptly titled, as it focuses on the politics of a kingdom, and all the deceit that goes on behind the scenes.<br /><br />If you wanted brilliant descriptions of battles like Erikson writes, you'll be sorely disappointed. There is only one battle that is told in first person and I might have to say, it is the worst detailed battle I have ever read. All the other battles are told in third person by a squire or someone similar, which really disappoints because you were led up to a point, switched to another story thread, and then you got switched back and were given the aftermath.<br /><br />It sounds like I'm only complaining but this is a good story, and told very well, along with the fantastic character development, this was a very enjoyable story. It also is pleasing that it is adult fantasy, shows some gore, and as mentioned by others main characters are killed off, so no one is safe. I always enjoy authors who do this, and Martin has pleased me in this aspect. Even though this book is no masterpiece it shows a lot of intelligence, and with the open threads that have been left unsolved, there looks to be a lot of promise in this series. I will definitely read the next book A Clash of Kings.because you were led up to a point, switched to another story thread, and then you got switched back and were given the aftermath. <br /> <br />It sounds like I'm only complaining but this is a good story, and told very well, along with the fantastic character development, this was a very enjoyable story.

038533348X|5.0|If you are a Vonnegut fan, you'll love the book. The author employs his typical, hyper-aware social commentary while using sometimes silly, often times sardonic, cynical humor. If you are the type of reader who is able to easily extract the deeper meaning of what Vonnegut is saying from his light and fanciful narrative, you will enjoy the book. Otherwise, you will find it simply a whimsical story. If your brain has a hard time wrapping around the absurd, you will not enjoy the book.
0393035158|1.0|Pages deep into Sam Harris' indictment of Islam, I recalled documentary footage of Senator McCarthy wagging papers in front of the camera and screaming \\"This civilization will die!\\" if the Communists weren't rooted out and vanquished. Harris is less histrionic but similarly insistent that Muslims are a menace to the West.  Within this supposed treatise on reason over superstition is a loathsome fear of readers of the Koran.  He depicts leaders of Islamic theocracies as 14th-century primitives eager to use 21st-century weapons.  This book is dangerous not because it will shake the faith of religious believers, most of whom will ignore it or having read it will go on believing regardless.  Demonizing Muslims and criticizing pacifism as it does, the book is intellectual cannon fodder for those favoring military conquest of Iraq and Iran.  After ridiculing the Old Testament mandates for stoning adulterers and killing neighbors who profane the Sabbath, Harris tries to make the case that the majority of modern Muslims follow similarly vicious doctrinal commands.  His evidence is flimsy, but those convinced by it will soon become suspicious of their Muslim neighbors.  The book adds tension to an already tense situation.     The book is deeply disrespectful toward organized religion in its many varieties, dismissing as a waste of time the devoted effort of believers to make sense of life through paths of faith and to try to make the world a better place.  There's no regard for New England abolitionists, labor leaders, advocates for the poor, and civil rights leaders whose political activism was inspired by faith.  To Harris, rationality rules.  How vacuous!          A much better book on most of the issues Harris covers is Jim Wallis' \\"God's Politics.\\"

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Granted that no film can capture an entire book, but rather its essence, this film interpretation of Austen's perennial classic does not live up to the novel on which it was based.  Instead of going for the light, clever, witty world Austen created in her novel, Joe Wright chose to turn Pride and Prejudice into some sort of heavy-handed, proto-Brontean melodrama.  It ignored the iconography of several scenes which are of critical importance to the story (for example, Darcy's first proposal is filmed outside, in the rain! which means that the difference between Elizabeth being cornered inside during the proposals she rejects and outdoors when she finally accepts is no longer present), and some of the lines (\\"You have bewitched me, body and soul...\\"--give me a break!) are just plain cheesy. <br /> <br />There are also several glaring socio-historical errors in this screenplay, not the least of which is Mr. Bingley nursing an ailing Jane back to health; a young gentleman would NOT be in a young woman's bedchamber (who was not in his immediate family, which Jane is not), especially when she was in a state of undress.  The lack of concern for nuances of etiquette between characters, lack of awareness of difference of behavior between classes, etc. also evinced a general ignorance of or concern for accuracy in portraying a book written by an author for whom such manners formed the basis for much of her works' humor.  Watching incidents like these are frustrating just plain painful to anyone who has spent any time with Austen. <br /> <br />That being said, there were a few aspects of the screenplay which are worthy of note.  The liberties taken with Charlotte Lucas (in which she goes into some detail about her reasons for marrying Mr. Collins) are well-done and point out to modern audiences the plight of the spinster in Regency-period England.  Likewise, a softer, gentler Mrs. Bennett is different from the 1995 BBC version (which is the standard by which P&P interpretations will CONTINUE to be judged, thanks to this overall mediocre silver screen version), but not necessarily unwelcome.  However, several secondary characters are missing from the cast, and their loss, although not of central importance to the plot, does diminish the overall impression which is present in Austen's novel, and is yet another unfortunate aspect of this version's screenplay.  They completely dropped a sister; without the bookish Mary, there is no foil to contrast Kitty and Lydia's reckless and unrestrained foolishness, two extremes of feminine behavior.  The other omission is of the Hursts (Bingley's other sister and her husband), as is their contribution to the picture of married life presented in the book (there is only one married couple in Austen's book which appears to be genuinely happy: the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, and thank goodness the writer(s) at least had the good sense to at least keep them in!). <br /> <br />Aside from the flaws in the screenplay, the acting by two of the main \\"Big Name\\" acting draws of this film, Keira Knightley as heroine Elizabeth Bennett and Judi Densch as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, is unremarkable.  While Densch gives merely an indifferent performance of her part as British actress \\"of a certain age\\" (rather than bringing any particular vitality to her character, an overbearing aristocrat and self-styled \\"patroness\\"), Knightley's acting is actually flawed; at no point in the film is she actually convincing in her part--she was too busy playing Keira Knightley in a long, old-timey dress. <br /> <br />Although the cinematography and costuming in this picture are beautiful and beautifully done, they is not enough to save this lukewarm interpretation of a wonderful book, and I have a feeling the only reason it has been as warmly received as it has is because not many people bother to read the original anymore.  Nobody involved with the making of this film (excepting, perhaps, those competent few who were in charge of wardrobe and props) ought to be allowed anywhere NEAR Austen's works again.

B00094ARZ0|4.0|John Derek will go down in history as one of the worst directors of all time.  One could call him the antipode to Stephen Spielberg.  However, Derek did have ONE thing going for him in his movies:  showcasing his lovely wife naked!<br /><br />It is odd that these days many people are too young to remember Bo Derek.  Growing up in the 80s, she was the undisputed queen of eroticism, and this film shows why that was so.  I just watched it again this morning & I had almost forgotten just how perfect her body is & how her long flowing hair looked while riding a horse.<br /><br />If it were not for Bo, I doubt if anyone ever would have heard of John.  In fact, he is already quickly becoming a footnote in the annals of Hollywood.  To be sure, this is a \\"B\\" movie and it's not very well done.  90% of the scenes look like they were thrown in as an afterthought.  The movie attempts to be comical at times, and fails miserably.  For the most part, it is a yawner.<br /><br />The one factor that just barely elevates it to 4 stars is Bo Derek shedding her clothes @ will.  If you're a Bo Derek fan, this movie is a can't miss!  When it comes to John Derek movies, this is as good as they get.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I can't decide whether I like this cd or not..but, I have listened to it a lot, so I guess that indicates something favorable about it.  By my lights (and ears) Apple has been uneven in its post breakup releases, with the Anthologies marking an especial low point, but Love is probably a must have for those of us who love the Beatles.  Just for the record, there's plenty of more incisive Beatles mash ups out there (on bootleg) that mix up Beatles tunes with non-Beatles music (e.g., \\"Let it Be\\" mashed up with a reggae song).  But still, it wouldn't be Christmas without a new release from a band that broke up before your mother was born, would it?
B0007TKNIS|4.0|I've never been a big fan of musicals.  For that reason, my 4 star rating is considerably high for a DVD that belongs to the genre.  This is certainly one of the best musicals I've ever seen, and people who are big fans of musicals are sure to enjoy it even more than I did.<br /><br />The big budget is certainly showcased in the movie.  It's filled with eye-candy sets & props that take us back to the late 19th century France.  Everything about the film is well done & top notch, from the singing to the acting.  The casting department deserves plenty of accolades.<br /><br />The story itself is a take-off on the beauty & the beast motif.  Fans of this somewhat repeated theme are sure to like this movie.  I believe that the recent V FOR VENDETTA movie actually has some parallels  with PHANTOM on a couple different points.<br /><br />PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is surely worth seeing at least once, even if you're not one who stays awake @ night thinking of the next musical you'll see.  When it comes to musicals, this is among the very best!

Also, this disc is full of behind the scenes/makings of features that are great (what you expect for the $$$, unlike other blu-ray discs). You won't be disappointed.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I am absolutely NOT a fan of the horror genre - on more than one Halloween outing with friends I have run, sobbing, out of a haunted house; my brother gets a kick out of jumping out from behind things to hear me scream; and at night, I still jump into bed from 3 feet away...just in case something's under there. Yet Saw has made it onto the list of my all-time favorite films. <br /> <br />Saw's psychological \\"damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't\\" concept intrigued me, so I rented it on DVD one night. I shut and locked my bedroom door, turned on every light in the room, and barricaded myself with blankets to see if the product lived up to the hype...and it did. <br /> <br />On one hand, I was terrified (afterward, I watched TV for a while to ward off the nightmares)...but I was awed by the film's brilliance. Solid acting, creative cinematography, and the most disturbing and mind-blowing plot twists imaginable.  <br /> <br />I was so impressed, I saw each sequel on its opening day...from the seat in the rear corner of the theater. No one can sneak up on you from there.
B00006IU73|5.0|This review is for people who have never heard of Porcupine Tree. If you have, then you don't need to read this, because you most likely know how good they are. With that said, this album really took me by surprise. I kept reading about how good this album was, but I really had no idea. It seemed to be on alot of people's favorite album lists, and I had never heard of Porcupine Tree. But, I was thoroughly interested in listening to them because of the rave reviews I kept running across. I was not dissapointed. It took me awhile to really understand what Porcupine Tree is all about, but once I did, I really enjoyed their music.<br /><br />This is one of those albums that almost mesmorizing. It just captivates you, you can sit there doing nothing and let time fly while you listen too it. Or you can soak it up while your involved in something. If you've never heard Porcupine Tree, and you like music, listen to this album. It's definetly worth checking out, and is a hidden gem among the rocky thorns of todays overgrown music.
0385474547|4.0|This book gives us an idea of what people in Africa are like, how people act, its culture, etc. Well, the thing I didn't like much about this book is is that it doesn't tell us the things in the book. The author wrote it for his own people, not for us. Example: when people visit each other they eat kola nut. But what does the kola nut represent? The author does not tell us, so we have to look it up. There are also certain things characters in the book does that we don't know why. So knowing the background of African culture will definitely help you understand this book. (See Comment)    Anyway, I found this book as more of an \\"African Litterature made easy.\\" I learned how people in Africa lived, what they did, what they believed in, that sort of thing. It was also an interesting story about how a man named Okonkwo, who fears failure through his whole life, led to this downfall.

After reading The China Study, we made the decision to eat a diet without animal products, vegan. We won't live forever. However, we expect to give ourselves a better chance of avoiding many of the diseases that disable the afluent American. There are no guarantees in this life, but just perhaps we've given ourselves some better odds. This book is a must for anyone interested in improving their health.

1577314808|5.0|Many people talk about presence and many books make a claim to take one into it but very few really know the essence of it. This book is powerful beyond words and exuberates presence. I recommend this book to all my asthma patients and it can seem a little complicated to some. However, for the vast majority - it is a very positive introduction to their lives. This book brings a welcome respite from the demands of daily living. Two people who have changed my life in the last ten years are Eckhart Tolle and Professor Konstantin Buteyko. Both people have performed amazing work and gave something very positive to mankind.
0060763280|4.0|The book called Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is basically a companion to the seminar Millionaire Mind Intensive. What one learns here is not just a formula that has been used successfully by some to pull themselves out of poverty, but more importantly perhaps the psychological aspects attached to wealth, money, power, the poor beliefs and psychological bad habits that keep us trapped, making fulfillment difficult. Arguably most importantly the author T. Harv Eker goes on to give entertaining stories, parables, and methods that can be used to change old mental and emotional habits that had become subconscious. Using these we can recognize and change those belief structures that no longer serve what we are desiring to become. I found this to be a very valuable contribution that has the ability to be used to create life anew. The book is aptly subtitled Mastering The Inner Game Of Wealth. <br /> <br />The book also offers the opportunity to take the Millionaire Mind Intensive seminar for a reduced price, which offers the chance to participate and experience the insights presented in the book in an intense and personal way that many have found life changing. He is determined to share this ifnormation with the masses who lacked a basic financial education while being raised. <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly for the  clarion call that wealth is not only the accumulation of great sums of money, but also the attitudes and beliefs that we hold about the money we have. It is entertaining, very readable, and well written. It shows why one person can have billions, and yet it isn't enough. They strive to collect more, yet are unable to fill that hole within them. Another person can have far less money yet be fulfilled as if they had all the money they will ever need... simply because within their relationship with wealth they do indeed have it whenever they desire it. <br />
0425179877|5.0|The book begins as Gene Kranz enters NASA in the early Mercury years. Back then, the U.S. space programs were disastrous (see \\"The Four Inch Flight\\"). Yet, through the sheer will of the determined individuals, the leadership from people such as Chris Kraft and George Low, and president Kennedy's challenge to go to the moon, NASA cut through its difficulties and finally surpasses the Soviet space program.<br /><br />The author takes the reader through the 1960s and 70s, through the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions with details so vivid the reader feels that he/she is in the Mission Control room, wear headsets and working through every crisis, lament every failure, and celebrate every achievement.<br /><br />Also, as NASA develops, the tenets of the Mission Control matures. Kranz defines the characteristcs of the controllers as Discipline, Competence, Confidence, Responsibility, Toughness, and Teamwork, with each mission as supporting evidence.<br /><br />This is a great book, written first hand by a former flight director. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about NASA's history or anyone who simply wants an exciting adventure book.
B000J103YI|4.0|As I was watching the \\"Dreamgirls\\" movie, I remember thinking to myself, I want the soundtrack CD!  I think most people who have seen the film would agree. <br />Although Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson have been getting most of the attention, the truth is that the entire cast does a knockout job. Some songs make you want to dance, while others will almost move you to tears.  You'll enjoy the \\"Dreamgirls\\" soundtrack.

0143034901|5.0|In the Barcelona of Franco Spain there is a teenager called Daniel Sempere who, from a library of out-of-print books, brought home a book by one Juli&aacute;n Carax which hugely impressed him.  We are never told what exactly it was about this book that so fascinated Daniel;  but when he tries to find out what else Carax had written, he learns that someone had bought up all his books in order to burn them:  Daniel's copy is one that survived.  Daniel is now driven to find out all he can about Carax.  Over some 400 pages he follows a trail of people who have information about him.  He is helped and abetted in his task by the only really vividly drawn character in the book, Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres,  a man of reckless courage and impudence, with a spicy and bawdy sense of humour and a purveyor of worldly wisdom to the adolescent Daniel, who falls blindly and dangerously in love with the young women he gets to know in the course of his quest.  Daniel and Ferm&iacute;n are constantly in danger:  Daniel from the relatives of one of the girls and also from  the person who is trying to destroy the copy of the book, and Ferm&iacute;n from a brutal fascist police-inspector who has murdered many of his victims but who in the case of Ferm&iacute;n, more than once, stops short of murder - but only just.<br /><br />There is a large cast of characters, and this is the kind of detective story which several times forces the rapid reader to turn the pages back to their last appearance to remind him of earlier incidents and connections related to them.  At the end, I was tempted to read the book again.<br /><br />In its first half, it tells its story in a very leisurely way, often with humour;  every now and again there is a scene of shocking violence;  the streets of Barcelona and the houses which Daniel enters in the course of his search are described with gothick touches - flickering lights, uncanny sounds, cobwebs, gusts of wind - which, I fancy, are meant to make you smile rather than shiver.<br /><br />But in the second half the pace quickens considerably; the humour in the narration fades (to revive briefly and touchingly in one of the last scenes);  the menace thickens; and there is an ingenious and well-crafted solution to all the mysteries.  What seemed in the first half a fairly light-hearted book becomes in the second half moving and immensely powerful.<br /> <br />But in the second half the pace quickens considerably; the humour in the narration fades (to revive briefly and touchingly in one of the last scenes);  the menace thickens; and there is an ingenious and well-crafted solution to all the mysteries.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I was frankly very disappointed in \\"Love and Theft\\". Thought the album was very over-rated. Thought reviewers were listening to Dylan's comments on the album, rather than the album itself. SO, after dragging of feet I finally ordered \\"Modern Times\\" What a superb album. I am STILL Listening to it. Tracks 2, 4, 6, and 7 are superb. This album TRULY deserves all of its praise.<br /><br />My 3 Favorite Dylan Albums are \\"Time Out of Mind\\", \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and any one of his Great early albums. Much preferred \\"The Times they are achangin'\\" to \\"Blonde on Blonde\\". I would put this album behind those three, and with his Great early albums.<br /><br />AND if you are a Zimmy Fan try to see the Dylan Exhibit that just closed at the Morgan in NYC. It is coming next to Minneapolis, with added exhibits from Hibbing.
0060926317|1.0|Subsequently proven to be a complete pack of lies, this book is a deeply cynical, mendacious, grossly inaccurate and offensively racist account of the Australian Aboriginals. <br /> <br />Marlo Morgan tells of an odyssey of spiritual transformation joining a group of Aboriginals (\\"real people\\") on walkabout through Australia. Despite her professed reverence for the \\"tribe\\", her book is littered with insincere and patronising platitudes that jostle for attention amidst the thinly veiled racism, describing her \\"travelling companions\\" as \\"half-cast\\", \\"half-breed\\", \\"natives\\" with feet \\"like hooves\\". Despite her alleged epiphany, Morgan retains the persona of an aloof, superior, white imperialist schoolmarm. <br /> <br />This book has never been released in Australia. I wonder why... <br /> <br />The unacceptable face of greedy 1990's surrogate spirituality as an offshoot of 1980's materialism.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|After 30 years of Rocky movies, its easy to forget that it all started with an Academy Award winning film. The DVD is a great clean video transfer with a new 5.1 auido mix.

And the free ticket to Balboa make it a bargain!
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Like the recent revival of the Ford Thunderbird, the Enterprise Season 3 DVD set is overpriced although the product within is beautiful. The video quality is fine, sound is rich, and the extras are good, but at least as much love and care were lavished on other series, like Freaks and Geeks, without the high price. (Through a series of fortunate events, I got my copy at a discount.)<br /><br />I don't consider myself a big Star Trek fan. Most of the shows set in the Trek universe work so hard to be \\"Star Trek\\" that much of the life is gone from them. My immediate attraction to Enterprise came because it was a bit less formulaic than the other shows-- for example, \\"comic relief\\" is blissfully absent here. The goofy humor of Star Trek: The Next Generation never appealed to me. Fox Mulder's dry wise cracking on The X Files? Funny stuff! Commander Data trying to be Sherlock Holmes? Not so much.<br /><br />Season 2 of this series found an unusually natural and convincing cast awash in a sea of weak dialog and worn-out stories. (Wow, there are aliens trying to destroy the Enterprise with a time bomb! Oh, it was only a dream.) Threatened with TV extinction, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman (who wrote many of season 2's episodes themselves) brought in several important new writers and loosened the reins on the aging Trek formula. All kinds of interesting ideas were unleashed and explored, characters gained dimension, and aspects of the difficult world we face here in the 21st century were reflected in  Enterprise's 22nd.<br /><br />In season 3 we have a series that offers the excitement of the best space opera (wowie zowie phasers, stunts, and great production design) and the ideas of real speculative fiction (cloning, dimensional shifts, and temporal manipulation). Ruminations on loneliness, loss, and sexuality bring human drama to a genre that often settles for melodrama. (Curiously, religion is absent.) At the same time, Archer and his crew are dealing with the kind of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of ER so compelling. Few big-budget action movies pack as much interest and emotion as \\"Star Trek: Enterprise-- the Complete Third Season.\\"of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of ER so compelling.

0679745653|5.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's is a shining example of the genius that is Truman Capote. In all writings it seems you're always bound to fall in love with the characters and world he has creates. Recent films like Infamous and Capote have tried to show the world what Truman was like, but in truth the only way to get inside his head is to read his works and understand that this short, encentric,and always flamboyant man had wisdom and values that he fed us though his books and today contiuly define American culture.
B00005JOLK|3.0|Well, I read the books when I saw the previews for the movie since I had not heard of them before. I think I would have been better off to wait until I had seen the movie and then read the books. Of course, I cannot be too harsh on the film since Peter Jackson's interpretation of the Lord of the Rings set a very, likely insurmountable standard for this kind of fantasy flick. However, I must say that the screenplay could have at least sort of attempted to follow the general story set down in the books. One of the most important things I think was left out was the fact that Brom died much earlier on in the story line and Murtagh made a much earlier appearance, a piece of the plot which plays heavily into the second book and will need to be addressed at the very beginning (if anyone will be willing to make the second movie) of the next film. And, uh, how come Eragon didn't go with Arya to Ellesmera? Again, kind of important for the next chapter. <br /> <br />I give the film 3 stars for one reason only: I loved the dragon. Saphira was more believable than her human costars.  The special effects were great and I didn't find my mind wandering too much as I was more interested in seeing what the dragon did next. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich as usually much stronger in these type of roles, but in this, they did not make me forget that they were Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich. The actor playing Eragon seemed like a good choice, but his lines sucked and he is good looking enough that it is almost distracting. <br /> <br />The moral of this review is watch the movie in the theaters to see the dragon in all her glory, but wait to see the weak humans try to keep up with her
B00005JPCY|5.0|As usual, no synopsis here; just a comment. And, yes, definite SPOILERS.<br /><br />When I realized at the start that it was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, my reaction was 'cool'! A time travel theme done by Bruckheimer; what more could anyone want? With Denzel Washington and Val Kilmer to boot--plus one Paula Patton, who in the beginning on the morgue slab looks almost like Halle Berry, almost to the extend of making me think 'what the...', but then turns safely into a non-Halle-Berry, which is all good, because Patton has several times the personality of the former.<br /><br />Since I write SF I am a clued-in kind of guy, and so when a terrorist/CSI tale turned into a time-travel story, well that was even better. It's a daring genre mix--a bit like The Island was--but that makes it more interesting. I know a lot of cinema goers get 'genre-confused' when the clues are pointing _this_ way at the start, but then the movie ends up going _that_ way, but in this case it worked.<br /><br />The sci-fi premise was simple, supported by the inevitable and probably necessary bit of yak-speak in which the word 'wormhole' just _had_ to figure. But once you accepted the basic idea, it was followed through with fairly solid logic. That's the hallmark of good sci-fi premises, and especially those involving time-travel, and even more especially those set in a current-day context.<br /><br />In this instance (last spoiler warning!) it was this:<br /><br />Take any given location on the map. You can build a device that peeks a fixed amount of time into the past within a given radius around that location. Meaning that you can't peek outside the area thus defined. The only way you can do that is if you carry some remote to the device around and position said remote close to whatever you want to look at, since it was a much smaller viewing radius. Also, you can only always look at a given point in time a fixed interval 'behind' your current position on the time-axis; that is, if you are looking back using the device at time 't' and you can look back by an interval of 'dt', the point in time you're looking at is 't-dt'. Meaning you'd better look close, because if you don't you might miss it--and even recording what you see doesn't help, because you can't look everywhere. Just like you can't look everywhere right now.<br /><br />That was the premise and they basically ran with it. I like those kinds of plots, because they allow you to spin out things without too much strain on credibility. Stephen Gould writes books like that: _Jumper_ and _Wildside_ are two examples of the same kind of approach. I've tried it myself. It's a very neat way of story-telling. Simple and clear premises often give rise to much more complex tales than worlds created with too much artifice.<br /><br />Another thing I really liked abut Deja Vu was the nature of its characters. They were intelligent people and behaved as if they were. In other words, they were also 'competent'. All-too-often this is a neglected aspect of characterization that tends to make otherwise potentially great movies seem unbelievable. The viewer sits in the cinema and says to him- or herself (and to the character actually) \\"Oh, come on, how could you not see that coming? What a dimwit!\\"<br /><br />It doesn't happen here, and especially to the main protagonist. What he doesn't predict and can't factor into his decisions are things he genuinely cannot know--because stuff just happens and that's life. But when he _can_, he thinks and calculates and judges and knows well enough what's what. That goes especially for his ability to judge people. He's the kind of guy who'll try to convince someone that something should be done, but at the same time sizes up and assesses a given situation, and knows when it ain't working and people aren't going to do what he wants them to. So he smiles, pretends to be agreeable--and then finds the best way to get around the problem. No temper tantrums and really stupid moves.<br/><br />I know some people think a character needs a significant 'flaw' to be interesting, but I always thought that there's plenty of 'interest' in someone being smart and competent. Life is complicated enough. 'Doug Carlin' is a character that could have sprung straight from a Robert Heinlein novel. Mixed in with his competence is 'backbone' and a capacity to make decisions about what's what and what he has to do, given that he is who he is.<br /><br />Of course, part of what drove him was not just what would have driven him anyway (the notion that he could maybe prevent the deaths of several hundred people), but the fact that he fell in love with the woman the back-in-time-peekers were peeping-Tom-ing at, and whom he'd previously seen on a slab in a morgue. That was very sweetly done, and also very believably. Another example of how the whole movie hung together almost seamlessly.<br /><br />Great flick.

0316172324|4.0|I am giving this book four stars for bringing together so many interesting studies and facts into one book. As a hypnotherapist the commentary on the various aspects of the power of the unconscious mind were fascinating to me. The book could have been more cohesive and explained why split second impressions can be both beneficial or detrimental. The weave of all this information was a little loose, and it tended toward repetition of the same concepts over again. I enjoyed it and  have recommended it to others.

It was boring and flashed back too much but the book was much better and I felt that three hours for this movie was way too long. Would have been better renting this than spending $7.50 to see it in the movies. A good movie for insomniacs.

It provides a wonderful visit back to a simpler, innocent time, a time when you did not have to worry about saying Merry Christmas, why can't children and adults believe in the big guy Ho Ho Ho.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|from the comments that the Director  makes on the DVD it feels like he misunderstands the relationship between Jane and Elizabeth. I think he also fails to use the letters in the movie to their full extent.  In Jane Austens time as I understand it letters were a very important form of communication, especially when it came to intimacy and I think they have been waved aside in this movie.  The movie could have used the letters to emphasize intimacy between characters and I think that the Director completely misses out on this opportunity. The bonnets were also very important in Jane Austens time especially in terms of a lady's \\"natural and unblemished [freckle free] complexion\\" and  eligibility for marriage and yet the director dismisses the Bonnet as a cliché and uses it far less than needed. The Bennet sisters for example have already got strikes against them in terms of marriability why give them another one by refusing them a bonnet? The book also says that by the time that it was written any real affection that Mr. Bennet may have felt for Mrs. Bennet has long since died out.  The movie contradicts this. I also feel as though the Movie version of Mrs. Bennet cares more for her eldest daughters than is indicated in the book, and that she is a far more understanding and sensible woman in the movie than she is in the book and Darcy's objections to marrying Elizabeth therefore carry less weight than they do in the book because she is not as lacking in sense as she is in the book.  The last scene ended a bit abruptly for me.  This movie is based on a love story and I think that the kiss needs to have lasted longer and not been cut off so abruptly and waved away like it was. I am also a bit confused about the commentary about there being no make up available to ladies at this time as some websites indicate that something resembling make up did exist at this point in time. I did like the person who acted out Mr. Collins - very well done, most of the other actors too although I'm not sure about Mr. Bingley's \\"silly scene\\" (when Jane is sick) seems a bit out of character. I like Keirra Knightly, and the person who played Darcy. I think the movie could have done without some of the nature scenes.  A bit disappointing really.   <br />

B00005KHEU|5.0|Released November 1979 the end of the 70s were upon us. For Jeff Lynne and Elo their release of \\"Discovery\\" would be a wonderful success to close out their fabulous 1970s career. Though not ELOs best \\"Discovery\\" is a mix of disco, pop and a little techno with some fusion mixed in. \\"Discovery\\" has a club sound to it, some of these tracks get you moving like in the dance clubs. The harmonies are sharp but the back up voices to Jeff Lynne are heavenly and have an incredible hall like sound to them. Jeff made the most of his three remaining band mates vocal talents of Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy, Kelly Groucutt. Besides the three hit singles of \\"Shine a Little Love\\" \\"Midnight Blue\\" and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" the other less known tracks on this cd are not filler material. \\"Need Her Love\\" is an amazing futuristic piece of vocal art. \\"On The Run\\", \\"Confusion\\" are all excellent Jeff Lynne pieces and of course mostly every ELO fans favorite \\"Last Train to London\\". \\"The Diary Of Horace Wimp\\" is another awesome track on this cd. Like I said there is no filler material on this cd. \\"Discovery\\" is a Jeff Lynne synth masterpiece, well written songs with beautiful instrumentation. Jeff Lynne and ELO put alot of effort into this recording, and the final result shows. The linear notes are very informative. The extra bonus tracks are nice to. Another beautifully remastered ELO cd reissue by Epic Legacy. \\"I tell you, the remastering on this cd will have you thinking Jeff Lynne and ELO are in your stereo speakers performing\\". The remastered sound is vibrantly clean and brings out the instrumentation incredibly sharp. 1979s \\"Discovery\\" would be ELOs final recording release of an amazing, incredible run in the 1970s. Highly recommended listening.......................
B000G1ALRK|4.0|I saw Eric Church live in concert. He was the opening act. I though he was so good that I wanted to get his CD. I don't buy a lot of CDs for myself. I have to like over half the songs before I will waste my money. I loved every song he sang. When I played the CD, it was okay, but let me tell you Eric Church sounds so much better live in concert then on CD. It's usually the other way around.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|Released in March 1974, and reached number one quickly, spawned three hit singles. Chicago already an established group by 1973 wanted to make Chicago VII a jazz album. This album has jazz mixed in with rock and was quite creative as Chicago pulled this experiment off. Believe me, there is no filler tracks on this cd. The first five songs take you on an instrumental joyride my favorite \\"Devil's Sweet\\" clocks in at about ten minutes. Terry Kath has a brilliant moment with \\"Byblos\\". \\"Call On Me\\" is another favorite that really is catchy with a Jazz rythem and of course \\"I've Been Searchin For along time\\" with its suspensful long instrumentation. Chicago VII is really a brilliant unappreciated gem. Every lyric and instrument is precisly placed in this well produced album. Remember Chicagos golden years of recording 1969-1979 were produced by James William Guerico. Fifteen tracks of pure 1970s bliss including the extra sixteenth track \\"Byblos\\"(rehearsel). The literature booklet supplied with cd is very informal and must be read to fully appreciate this amazing recording. Rhino does an excellent job on this reissue, if you love Chicago do yourself a favor and get all the Chicago Rhino remastered reissues it is worth it. Chicago VII a brilliant unappreciated Chicago recording.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I have thoroughly listened to the album and have come to the conclusion that this is excellent music. I could hardly hear Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation, Nightwish or Britney Spear in their songs. So there's no argument here. It's better than Fallen or a well conceived follow-up. The next best thing I can suggest is invest in a good hi-fi system. I'm going to the concert.
B000002P2W|5.0|First off this cd rocks.The two known songs \\"Slip Kid\\", \\"Squeeze Box\\", are catchy rock riffs. This album is considered Pete Townshends middle age stage and really one of his most personal recordings with The Who. Hearing this cd I feel Townshends guitar and vocals sound as fresh and crisp as \\"My Generation\\" 1965. \\"Success Story\\", \\"How Many Friends\\", \\"Imagine A Man\\" are all great songs. Really this whole cd is crisp sounding, every song is a good listen, there is no filler on this cd. \\"The Who By Numbers\\" is an underated album from 1975, and not very much appreciated by some Who fans or rock fans in general till maybe they hear it. The three live extra tracks are from \\"The Whos 1975 Tour\\" and sound brilliantly played live and are a treat to have on this remastered edition. The remastering is incrdible on this cd and sounds like it was recorded today, once again kudos to MCA for a fine cd edition of \\"The Who By Numbers\\". In all \\"The Who By Numbers\\" is a cd Who fans must have or any rock fan in general..........
0393327655|5.0|Just finished reading this find from the library today. Its so good, I actually read the notes too. I had a little trouble getting through the Consciousness chapter, but I'll reread it again before returning it to the shelves. The book states, in a clear writing style, exactly the way I've felt for years, but were afraid, and now I know why, to say in public. I think it's time to speak out. Religion is a farce, fantasy, dangerous, and no longer viable for our future as humans. We have to start talking together and accepting other ways of looking at the world without killing each other. This book is very frightening to read, and should be to anyone who has a mind that hasn't been abducted by organized religion. Harris writes in a way that clears out the cobwebs and uses the truth to support his premises. <br />Sam Harris, keep up the good work.
B000BI0WOA|4.0|During the 1985 Live Aid concert, it gave an opportunity for many bands that had established a cult following to come out and play on the world stage.   Perhaps one band that benefited from this more than any other band was Dire Straits.   Dire Straits' live performance of \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Sultans of Swing\\" clearly elevated the band to superstar status.    It was also the momentum from Live Aid that propelled \\"Money For Nothing\\" to #1 song status and the album \\"Brothers in Arms\\" to #1 album status.    If you look beyond \\"Money For Nothing\\" and \\"Brothers in Arms\\", you will discover what a terrific band Dire Straits is.   Much of Dire Straits is the result of the awesome guitar work of Mark Knopfler, but there is also some great instrumentation from other band members such as Mark's brother David and bassist John Illsley..  In many circles, Knopfler is considered as good as they come.   For Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the \\"British Invasion\\" that was taking place.   In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way:  a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.     Knopfler has also proven himself to be a top-notch lyricist - writing both humorous and serious songs.  The combination of outstanding instrumentation, great lyrics and a mix of old-fashioned Rock genres is really what made Dire Straits such a great band.    When Dire Straits disbanded in the early 1990s, Knopfler would continue his creative work as a solo artist.   The collection \\"The Best of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler - Private Investigations\\" provides a single collection of Knopfler's work - with Dire Straits and as a solo artist. <br /> <br />There are two other compilations available to consider: <br /> <br />\\"Sultans of Swing - The Very Best of Dire Straits\\"  is a collection that strictly has Dire Straits work.  This is a good collection and it includes songs that are not found on the \\"Private Investigations\\" compilation.  Most notably it includes \\"Lady Writer\\", \\"Heavy Fuel\\", and some live cuts (there are no live cuts on \\"Private Investigations\\").  The one issue with this compilation is that it includes radio-edit versions of songs such as \\"Money For Nothing\\" and \\"Sultans of Swing\\".  Radio-edits of thee classics do not do these songs justice and it hurts the collection.  It also is missing songs like \\"Telegraph Road\\" and \\"Your Latest Trick\\". <br /> <br />\\"Money For Nothing\\" is an older and less comprehensive collection that also focuses on Dire Straits.    It was released before Dire Straits' \\"On Every Street\\" album (so no material from that album).  It includes some live cuts (\\"Telegraph Road\\" and \\"Portobello Belle\\").  It also includes songs not found on the \\"Private Investigations\\" collection (\\"Down to the Waterline\\", \\"Twisting By the Pool\\", \\"Where Do You Think You're Going\\").  Like the \\"Sultans of Swing\\" collection, this collection is greatly hurt by radio-edits. <br /> <br />While the \\"Sultans of Swing\\" collection did include radio-edits and was missing some key songs, it did represent every Dire Straits album - including live ones such as \\"Alchemy\\" and \\"On the Night\\".    The \\"Private Investigations\\" collection does not include any material from \\"Communique\\", \\"ExtendedancEPlay\\", \\"Alchemy\\", and \\"On the Night\\".   The albums and associated Dire Straits material that are represented include:   \\"Dire Straits\\" (\\"Sultans of Swing\\"); \\"Making Movies\\" (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Tunnel of Love\\", \\"Skateaway\\"); \\"Love Over Gold\\" (\\"Private Investigations\\", \\"Telegraph Road\\"); \\"Brothers in Arms\\" (\\"So Far Away\\", \\"Money For Nothing\\", \\"Brothers in Arms\\", \\"Walk of Life\\", \\"Your Latest Trick); \\"On Every Street\\" (\\"Calling Elvis\\", \\"On Every Street\\").   The good news is that full versions of all of the songs are included - no radio-edits!!! <br /> <br />As mentioned \\"Private Investigations\\" includes solo material from Knopfler.  This material includes \\"Golden Heart (\\"No Can Do\\"); \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" (\\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\", \\"What It Is\\"); \\"The Ragpickers Dream\\" (\\"Why Aye Man\\"); \\"Shangri-La\\" (\\"Boom Like That\\", \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\").   There are also two instrumental songs from soundtracks - \\"Going Home\\" (Theme from \\"Local Hero\\") and \\"The Long Road (Theme from \\"Cal\\").   There is also the title song from the duet album that Knopfler recorded with Emmylou Harris (\\"All the Roadrunning\\").  This song was included on \\"Private Investigations\\" prior to the release of that duet album.  There is no live solo material from Knopfler's live solo albums (\\"One Take Radio Sessions\\" and  \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\"). <br /> <br />I normally prefer songs to be ordered in chronological order.  This allows me to see how an artist has progressed over time.  Unfortunately, \\"Private Investigations\\" does not do this.   There is sort of a logical division of material (Dire Straits material is found on Disc 1 and Knopfler's solo material is found on Disc 2).  However there is no ordering -  (for example, \\"Brothers in Arms\\" is the second to last song on Disc 2 and \\"Sultans of Swing\\" follows \\"Telegraph Road\\" on Disc 1).  In the case of Dire Straits and Knopfler, it is a poor decision to mix up the ordering of the songs.   For fans of Knopfler, they saw how Knopfler's solo style progressed to have a more Country music and storytelling narrative style.  The mixing of the ordering of the songs prevents you from listening to this and hearing that musical progression. <br /> <br />One thing that is unusual is that the liner notes include the lyrics to all of the songs.  This is something that is not too common on greatest hits compilations.  For each of the tracks, the songwriting and copyright credits are listed for each of the tracks.   I would have also liked to have seen the album titles listed for each of the tracks.  It would have also been nice to have a write-up of the band (the \\"Sultans of Swing\\" compilation doesinclude one).  Overall, this is still the only place to get a Dire Straits and Knopfler combination.  One certainly cannot complain about the quality of the music included.  I'd still recommend this.
032147404X|2.0|I am usually not writing reviews, but i also found this book very shallow and the only reason not to return it is that shipping exceeds its value. <br /> <br />Its the first book EVER seen with full page advertismnets in the back from companies like B&H and CDW and so on, of which the author claims he is not get anything from. <br /> <br />
B000I5X81A|3.0|this is like a lot of projects where big names team up - the sum is equal to less than its parts.  Cale is usually much better than he is on this cd; on most of the tunes it's almost like they phoned it in. Clapton is too mellow. I agree with the reviewer who longs for the screaming guitars, like crosswords (which I read somewhere Clapton hates). On most of the songs, I can't tell which one of them is singing.  It's like they both took valium or just weren't feeling an energy that day.  some of the songs sound like warmed over Leon Russell, e.g., when this war is over, it will be a better day, with a piano and jump beat.  get cale's anthology, or his last one, back to Tulsa I thik is the name, for the real JJ Cale.  or get Lightnin' Hopkins for the real deal.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This film is really an amazing piece of work. Being the first digitally recorded music concert, the original recording is even in amazing quality. Awesome, if you are a Talking Heads fan - go for it.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|The sound quality isn't what most people say it is. Perhaps the format   of surround sound is very nice but this material on stereo CD is clipped   and you can hear it. It's not horribly clipped but it's not the audiophile   quality I was hoping for from reading some of these reviews. While the highs  definitely sound more pronounced they are also distorted. Not by much but   by enough to be annoying if you're expecting something like a remaster.   If I had purchased this expecting a studio quality remaster of the   originals I'd be very very upset. The softer passages all sound very nice   but when the volume swells the highs start to break up... not by a lot but  it shouldn't happen at all. Either this was done intentionally or whoever   put \\"Love\\" together (I find it hard to believe George Martin would allow   his name to be on this) was in a hurry. It looks (on an audio editor) and   sounds (with high quality headphones) like an amateur cut and paste job. I  want to hear some high quality remastering of The Beatles source material   but if this is any indication of what to expect I'll go to bittorrent and   grab it for nothing because it won't be worth spending money on.     I won't argue with anyone who says The Beatles catalogue is some of the   best (or probably the very best) pop/rock material ever released to the   public. If you don't like The Beatles music don't bother reading this and   don't bother buying this CD because there's nothing here that's going to   change your mind. If you love The Beatles stuff and aren't expecting the   best sound but are curious about all the hoopla then pick it up. The   material is great and the mixing or \\"mashing\\" is interesting and does   present this fabulous material in a different light. I particularly like   the 'Within You Without You / Tomorrow Never Knows' work. I never would   have guessed these two songs could be merged into something that wouldn't   sound like a trainwreck. Absolutely wonderful! 'Strawberry Fields Forever'  is one that lends itself nicely to the mixing although I don't think I   care much for the gratuitous way pieces like the Sgt. Pepper's Theme is   plunked into the middle along with 'Piggies' and what seems like a truck   load of other fragments and sound bites. Neither do I care much for the   way \\"While my Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is treated with the Phil Spector type   orchestration. It clutters what is otherwise a beautiful acoustic piece.   The vocal loop after the title lyric on \\"Lucy In The Skies With Diamonds\\"   (some sort of repetitive wail) is annoying as hell and I have to wonder   what the sound editor was thinking. The bending of Ringo's voice on the   intro to Octupus' Garden from Goodnight is touching as is much of what is   blended together on this CD. The lighthearted Beatlesque banter by John   Lennon as Goodnight fades from the final track particularly so given the   circumstances.     I like the CD but only because I love The Beatles music. I think more care  should have been put into Love in the studio. The raw material is good   enough to deserve that. If Apple ever decides to do a real remaster of the   source recordings I'll be on it but until then this kind of thing is just   good MP3 fodder.

B00005JPCY|4.0|D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is the perfect blend of science fiction and action film for the average movie watcher as well as the science fiction fan. At its core, it is a thrilling, well paced action adventure story about an ATF agent, Doug Carlin, investigating a terrorist bombing on a ferry full of US Navy sailors in New Orleans. 540 people are killed in the massive explosion, but one young woman's body washes up and doesn't seem to fit with the other victims; though it looks like a victim of the explosion, the body was discovered 8 minutes before the bomb went off. Other pieces of evidence regarding this victim quickly lead Carlin to roughly piece together where she fits in the puzzle; unfortunately, none of it is enough to provide leads to the perpetrator.<br /><br />When Carlin presents his information to the FBI agents in charge, they are quickly impressed by his keen ability to size up a crime scene and filter out the noise from the pertinent details. They invite him to join a new test project that uses the latest technology to analyze a crime scene. Though the FBI and scientists involved try to hide the true nature of the technology, it doesn't take agent Carlin long to realize that there is more to it than advanced surveillance camera processing. This is where the science fiction weaves itself into the crime action drama film. While testing a new high-powered telescope technology, a way to bend the fabric of space/time is discovered, allowing the ability to watch the past in \\"real time\\" exactly 4+ days before.<br /><br />What makes this film work so well is that the action mostly takes place in the present, but the technology leads to some very good storytelling and the most interesting car chase ever conceived. I had read in some positive reviews that as good as it was it didn't fully make sense...well they are wrong - it complete sense - just pay attention to the details along the way and the story comes together nicely. Yes, there are a few inconsistencies - whose explanations probably were left on the cutting room floor to keep the film well paced - but they are small. If you have a basic understanding of the physics and space/time you can piece them together yourselves; if you are not, don't worry and ignore them because they don't take away from this very film.planations probably were left on the cutting room floor to keep the film well paced - but they are small.

B000JK8OYU|1.0|I did grow up in the 60s, but even if I hadn't, I could recognize this CD as another way to milk the Beatle name for mo' money. I'm not a purist by heart, I'm not upset by this CD release, and taking chances is necessary to explore new musical depths, but this fails. This CD was a gift, and so I guess it's the thought that counts; the buyer knows the Beatles are number one in my opinion. I won't tell them if you won't, but if they want to borrow it and forget to give it back, I won't remind them, either. I'll have it handy when they come to visit, both to tempt them to borrow it and to let them know I haven't thrown it out.
B000000WGL|5.0|Keith shows his raw earthy talent,with almost a garage band feel...although a very tight professional garage band. Keith's raspy singing is perfectly soulful with a dash of punk, and all the women singing backup are excellent. It gets better each time I listen to it. A classic.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|This is one of the best written comedies I have seen in a while.  Not only does Thank You For Smoking owe a lot to Christopher Buckley for writing the novel it is based on, it owes a lot to Aaron Eckhart who was a perfectly cast lead in this movie.  I'd always enjoyed his work as a character actor in the past, and this role gave him a chance to show his leading man capabilities. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast does really well for the most part with some good characters to play.  Just like with Batman Begins, Katie Holmes is probably the weakest link in an ensemble of veteran pros.  The dialogue is sharp and quirky at times.  Overall, some smart subtle jokes. <br /> <br />The movie never gets preachy on the issue of cigarettes to where it takes a side.  The real message here is to educate people and let them decide for themselves, and to think for yourself.  I'm not a smoker, but all I can say is, whether you agree or disagree with smoking laws, that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Overall I enjoyed the movie. Good action, good actors. But it was kinda too dark and I believe they could have written and directed much better. It reminded me a bit of Bad Boys series which I think were much better
B000E5N62U|4.0|Only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have the \\"hit singles\\" on it like Dan or other Fagen solo works, but I don't buy Dan or Fagen for pop hits.  And I don't think it's quite Kamakiriad, and certainly not The Nightfly, yet it's still excellent.<br /><br />The only other disappointment is that a few of the songs apparently still feature Roger Nichols Wendell drum machine, instead of a human drummer, but it's cleverly disguised. As with much of Fagen's previous works, the brilliance of the songs may take a few listens, but the genius last longer that way.  The liner notes on each song depicting the how's and why's of the writing add great insight to what is often the oblique Fagen lyrical approach.<br /><br />Worth the price just for \\"The Night Belongs to Mona\\", which epitomizes the gorgeous songwriting style that is definitively Donald Fagen's contribution to pop music, summed up in one beautiful jazz-pop anthem.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Simply fantastic, this can be considered really a brand-new Beatles album and not only a compilation. Enjoy it.
B00005JPCD|1.0|Children's movies are NOT the forum for adult propaganda.  Children do not have the capacity to see the lop sided message for what it is, and they become overly emotional and fearful.  Save the sermon for appropriate venues.  Sucking parents into a theater with their children expecting to see a fun, happy movie and then shoving a viewpoint on them and scaring the hell out of the kids is inappropriate and irresponsible. <br /> <br />In addition, I was bored to death.  This is just anothe sappy rerun of a long list of gooey gunk.  Small children will be fascinated by the dancing and singing litte penguins (until the horror of the evil humans show up).  Adults and older kids will sit there rolling their eyes.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I ordered several of these as Christmas presents because I had seen this on TV.  I was literally dancing around the room when it was on television because I simply couldn't sit there.  They are still amazing after all these years.  What more can I say?
B000002L7V|3.0|\\"Sacred Heart\\" is Dio's 3rd solo album coming after the successful \\"Last In Line\\" disc.  The original Dio band (Dio, Appice, Bain, Campbell) are still together on this disc augmented by keys man Claude Schnell.  \\"Sacred Heart\\" would find Dio at the top of his career as a concert draw.  I remember seeing this tour and he took a huge production out on the road complete with a huge mechanical fire breathing dragon that Ronnie fought a sword duel with on stage.  He also had a huge floating crystal ball that contained holographic image of Ronnie doing a spoken intro to the title track to \\"Sacred Heart\\".  Kind of like Glenda the good witch from The Wizard Of Oz.  It was all a bit Spinal Tap-ish, but it was great fun at the time.  The album is ok, but I don't count it as one of Dio's best.  In fact most of the material on it is very average 80's metal.  Not necessarily bad, but Dio has done much better.  The song \\"Hungry For Heaven\\" pretty much lifts its riff straight from The Who's \\"Baba Oriley\\".  \\"Shoot Shoot\\", \\"Fallen Angels\\", \\"Just Another Day\\", \\"Another Lie\\" and even the rocking opener \\"King Of Rock N Roll\\" are all just.......kind of dull.  There are three tracks on the disc that redeem the album in my opinion.  \\"The title track \\"Sacred Heart\\" is almost a bit proggy clocking in at over 6 minutes.  \\"Rock N Roll Children\\" is a cool song, although it does suffer from some of Dio's patented nonsense lyrics.  \\"Like The Beat Of A Heart\\" is a cool rocker with some great Dio vocals.  Overall though this is a very average album for Dio and crew.
B00005JOYM|3.0|I was very disappointed in this movie.  I purchased it just because I thought it should belong in one's movie collection.  With all the deaths associated with the fallen Trade Centers and the Iraqi War aftermath, it was hard to give that much importance to these two lives.  The movie cover is great.  The movie does not live up to the cover.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|It's the best. Don't get the newer made for TV version released in 2000. You'll be disappointed.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|As a very loyal Jane Austen fan, I am unsure of how to even begin my discourse of the faults that abound in this pathetic display of complete disregard for periodic pieces!  I agree with the previously posted review that stated that were Jane Austen alive today she would be grieved...yes, and for her sake, many of her loyal fans certainly are!  How could Keira Knightley think she was portraying Elizabeth Bennet correctly?  How, for that matter, could ANY of the cast find their performances even adequate, much less outstanding?  Besides the problems already listed, and despite the fact that there are many, there is one in particular which stands out in my mind and causes me to cringe:  the scene near the very end of the film where Elizabeth and Darcy have married and are seen back at Pemberley.  Elizabeth comes out onto the terrace at night, wearing Mr. Darcy's oversize nightshirt!  This would never have been done, and certainly not out in the open where anyone might see!  Then, to make matters worse, she proceeds to sling herself up on a nearby table and sit cross-legged...a position no well-bred woman would have assumed, and certainly not on a table!  The final horror that adds to this parade of miserable mistakes is when Darcy actually joins her on the table, sitting behind her and holding her in a way which would seem sweet in the modern setting of a chick flick, but which is grossly out of tune with what is supposed to be a period piece.   <br />In fact, it is not just this one scene which so scathingly grates on the nerves of loyal Austen fans, but the overall lack of any understanding of time period!  The actors all seem just that--acting (and very badly) in a story set in a completely foreign time period to them.  They seem lost the whole time, as if they aren't sure what they are supposed to be doing, and their performances keep the audience from being drawn into the story.  If the goal of the film industry was to take a wonderful, timeless classic and remake it with something modern audiences could relate to, they have failed miserably; for by trying to \\"modernize\\" this story, they take away the very essence of its timeless appeal.  This is a story which is timeless not because of its settings, but in spite of them.  What makes this book so good and so intriguing for so many generations is that it is a fabulous character study and we can all relate to the very human characters in Pride and Prejudice.  We feel their pain, embarrassment, excitement, joy, anger, and pride--we can relate to them and understand them, even if we don't know firsthand what it feels like to live in a society like theirs.  The rules of etiquette which bound them are not impressed upon us today, but we can still enjoy the story, and feel for the characters.  But take away those very rules and the story becomes completely lackluster and stupid--and certainly not worth telling! <br />The argument may be made that audiences today don't understand the society of Jane Austen's day, so we must modernize the story somewhat.  To that I say that we should not cater to the modern audiences' lack of regard for history, but rather we should try to acquaint people with the way things were.  It doesn't have to feel like a history lesson...but it should be historically correct.  If we cannot do so without skewing the story, we should leave it be, rather than ruin a beautiful classic. <br />The overall costumes, makeup,  and attitudes of the whole cast are outrageously misplaced.  Though we cannot be too harsh on the actors--we must lay much of, if not all, the blame at the director's feet.  After all, he has the final say in what goes into his film and how it is to be portrayed.  Obviously, no one connected with this film's production cared to consult the book or history of that period...or so we must assume by the lack of believability in the whole portrayal.   <br />Lest anyone think I am attacking Keira Knightley or any of the cast personally, let me just say that I have nothing against any of the actors when they are in their element--the kind of films they and their directors understand.  Perhaps, though, they should have taken the cast of this film and produced a modern chick flick.  They could certainly not have done any worse. <br />If the film industry in general must produce bad romance films, they should at least confine the damage they feel must be done to stories set in this time period, so that they might have a chance at getting something right, and they should be advised to leave well enough alone in tampering with great literature which has many fans.  I feel very sorry for anyone who is introduced to Pride and Prejudice in this film version, as they will probably either hate it because it is so bad, or will think it a \\"cute\\" romance movie, without knowing the excellent taste they are missing from the original story.

006097625X|5.0|I have no frame of reference when I write this review as in my view no work I ever came across comes close to this book. It's a research paper of sorts. And it's honest. The author is putting his money where his mouth is by presenting a seemingly exhaustive research work in this form.<br /><br />I would like to add that such a work is beyond starring system of any kind. My five stars apart, the author, I think, is bound to earn a lot of respect for his honesty with which he has worked out this research and its presentation.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|If you want a predicatble, up-beat movie, as some reviewers apparently wanted, then this movie is not for you.  Donnie Darko is off-beat, quirky, and very dark.  The acting is superb.  Those who are patient will find that there is a payoff at the end. <br /> <br />The movie uses principles of quantum physics to show how one action performed by one person can have significant consequences later on.  I watched the original DVD release a few years ago and was very impressed.  I recently watched the Director's Cut and found myself thinking that the original was slightly better.  The director's cut adds 20 minutes to the original movie.  I highly watching reccomend either version.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|This is absolutely a great dvd with classic performances of KISS. This is the period when KISS was hungry and playing at their best. I know this is the period that would change my life and career path, and ultimately lead me to play drums for the next 29 years. This is the dvd that needed to be released to show the force KISS was. Before the dolls, pinball machines, and every other toy or collectible Gene could think up to put their trademark logo on,they really enjoyed playing and creating music.<br /><br />Who knows why they aren't nominated in the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame,but they should be. In closing I will say that even a casual fan will eat this up.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This was one of my favorite movies of 2006.  Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors as is Paul Giamatti.  What is great about this movie, is that you forget what actors you are watching, fall into a spell, and are swept into the world that is created by director Neil Burger.<br /><br />This movie will leave you wanting to see it again in order to solve the mystery that just unfolded before your eyes.  It plays like a two hour magic trick and when it is over, you are trying to figure out how you were so easily fooled.  It is amazing.  DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!
0312330537|5.0|I found this book serendipitously while staying in a rented cottage in Provence.  From the moment I picked it up, I was unable to put it down.  My two weeks in Provence were filled with images of Bombay, a dancing bear and complex ethics and relationships.   Shantaram is the most captivating novel I've read in years.  Epic, romantic, mysterious and harshly realistic - this book is for the adventurer of spirit and soul.  I can't wait for the movie, yet the best \\"movie\\" already exists in my mind from the wonderful images and characters of the page.  What a gem - and an exotic one at that!
B00003CXCW|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. This is how acting is suppose to be. While watching this movie I feel like I'm in another zone, simply because of how this movie pulls you in and doesn't let you go until well after the credits. <br /> <br />My background: For one, I'm by no means a movie classic enthusiast. I am 19 (18 at the time of purchase) and I live in southern California. I bought this DVD from Tower Records at more then twice the price. <br />
B000F7CMRM|5.0|An excellent, suspenseful, engrossing spy story with many twists and turns.
0446691437|5.0|Of the dozen or so books I've read on creativity, this stands head and shoulders above the rest. Pressfield understands the obstacles many creative people face and he explains how to develop the mindset to overcome problems. At times, reading it is like getting a cold slap in the face: immediate, effective, and no holds barred.
B000E1155E|4.0|Even before listening to their music, this band is interesting in two respects: their age (all members were 19-20 y.o. when the album was released in January 2006) and the way their songs became popular even before the release of their first album through demo tapes and, more importantly, file-sharing on the net. As a result, not only were people able to sing along during their gigs before the songs were officially published, but their album was the fastest sale for a debut album in the UK. Some critics however pointed out that they have also beneficiated from a strong support by the highly influential music magazine NME, earning them the label of \\"NME band\\". They've refused to appear on UK television since late 2005 or at prizes ceremonies, like the Brit Awards, adding to the controversy surrounding them    Anyway, once you strip away the hype, what's left? Well, I'd say a pretty decent first album, which musical landscape is a bit of a \\"the Clash meet Trainspotting\\", combining a sound bordering on the punk rock of the former with a contagious, albeit sometimes unfocused, youthful energy and lyrics reflecting the realities of working class life but devoid of the strong political positions ever present with Joe Strummer. With more than half the songs running below 3 minutes, and only two above four, it is extremely fast-paced. This is especially true of the first half of the album, which runs more on raw energy than anything else and, as a result, passes you by in a bit of a chaotic blur, despite the highly recognizable and entertaining first single \\"I Bet you look good on the dancefloor\\"    Things change, however, with the quieter and somewhat moody \\"Riot Van\\", allowing the listener to finally enjoy the rich and surprisingly nuanced voice of lead singer Alex Turner; and they keep improving over the last half-dozen of songs. The more measured energy distiled let us better appreciate other aspects of their music: the more intricate structure of \\"Perhaps Vampires is abit strong but....\\" and \\"A certain romance\\", the clever rhythm of \\"Red Light indicates doors are secured\\", and when the pace picks up again (\\"When the Sun goes down\\"), it isn't as overwhelming as it feels gratifying and pleasurable    They came top in a good number of \\"top album of the year\\" lists. I can't agree, as I think others would far more deserve that honor - Midlake's \\"The Trials of Van Occupanther\\", Band of Horses' \\"Everything all the time\\", M Ward's \\"Post War\\", Editors' \\"The Back Room\\", not to mention sensation Gnarls Barckley's \\"St. Elsewhere\\" or, obviously, Thom Yorke's \\"The Eraser\\" all come to mind instead. Arctic Monkeys are a lot of things, but original is not one of them. There's no original sound, no ambition to break new grounds. But their enthusiasm is contagious, and they do propose an overall highly enjoyable first act, and deserve to be watched out for their next album, rumored to be released as early as late Spring this year
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|One of my friends saw \\"V\\" while it was in theaters and suggested I go. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed with the reviews and decided against it. I didn't even think about the movie again until I was in my local library and saw it available for free rental. \\"Oh yeah, THAT movie...\\" I decided I might as well pick it up.  <br /> <br />Wow. I was FLOORED. Not only did I thoroughly love the movie, but I watched it two more times before promptly buying my own copy. This movie is fantastic. It will certainly deal with challenging issues beyond what you'd see in most films out today. This movie does not ask you to love its hero or support his side. It presents two extremes and provides the viewer with the difficult choice of laying out his own choices much as the characters in the movie must do. <br /> <br />V is not your common hero, and the movie makes it just as easily to hope he fails as it is to hope he succeeds. Even the opponents V fights against are not without their redeeming qualities in the complex world around them.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend people see this movie, and possibly read the graphic novels that inspire it as well. Many people find the similiarities between themes in the movie and the real world to be uncomfortable - but it should be emphasized that this story was written first, and if one mirrors the other, it is today's world mirroring the original vision in \\"V for Vendetta\\".  <br /> <br />This movie now tops my list of favorites, I cannot recommend it enough for anyone who likes complex, emotional, and exciting films.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Although I liked Josh's new CD, I found the music wasn't quite as appealing to me as in his first 2 CDs.  However, no matter what song he sings, his voice gives me a sense of peace and harmony that I haven't found with any other artist in a very long time.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I've been skeptical in recent years over the idea of global warming.  There's evidence -- and Gore showed it in his film -- that the Earth has been through warmer, more tropical periods than the one in which we now live.  It's also been through cooler periods.  I'm not an environmental scientist, but I know enough about statistics, correlations, and so forth (I do have a Ph.D. in the social sciences) that I can see that this phenomenon is for real.  The Tim C.s and E. Keech's out there are who bash this film do so out of partisan spite without offering a shread of real scientific evidence to back their counterclaims.  People like you two need to either put up or shut up.  This isn't a partisan issue.  This is not even an American issue.  It's a human issue, and it's time to act, now, before the human race has to put itself on the endangered species list.      Gore may have said or done some really dumb things in the past, like his 'inventing the Internet' remark or the way he generally handled his 2000 campaign for the White House, but then who doesn't make mistakes?  He's right on target with this documentary.  He's done his homework.  His information is based on well-conducted, documented research.  He's credible, in a nut-shell.  This is no mistake here.  This problem is real, and as the film says, it's An Inconvenient Truth.  It's time to act before Earth becoms an inconvenient place to live.
B00065MDRW|5.0|When people talk about the roots of progressive rock, this album is usually one of the main contenders. Listening to this album now, I can honestly say I enjoy other King Crimson albums more, and other progressive rock albums for that matter. But the fact that this album was created in the late 60's, experimenting with the now classic styles of progressive rock, and while other giants in the genre were just getting started, makes this a monumental and definitive album.<br /><br />The original line-up of Robert Fripp(guitar), Greg Lake (bass, vocals), Ian McDonald (keyboard, synths), Michael Giles (drums), and Peter Sinfield (lyrics) was a short-lived one, but one that created their best album until the legendary power trio (Fripp, Wetton and Brufford) stunned the progressive scene in 74 with \\"Red\\". Coincidentally this album starts in a similar vein to \\"Red\\", with the frenetic \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" setting the album off with a fast and powerful start. The song combines some harsh vocals and a timeless, classic Fripp riff to kick things off. This is ensued by a stunning and overtly technical jazz-fusion middle section, which leads back to the main motif and riff. It is an outstanding opener, and the most fluid, immediate song KC would make for years.<br /><br />The rest of the album is significantly more relaxed, creating a heavy vibe of sadness and melancholy. This is probably best shown with the classic ballad \\"Epitaph\\", a superb and lush outing that is both texturally beautiful and thematically unsettling. This is due to the profound and touching lyrics dealing with the ease and excess of misguidance and ignorance, sung with great passion and a deal of desperation from Lake. Musically the song has a heavy dosage of strings and dramatic timpani rolls to build up a brooding piece.<br /><br />\\"I Talk To The Wind\\", which comes in before \\"Epitaph\\", is a very calming piece, slowly washing over with some gentle flute playing, vocal harmonies and some splashy ride cymbals, it is a nice song, and acts as a good contrast to the album's opening flurry. \\"Moonchild\\" seems a little pointless to me, and the only weak song. It starts decent enough, and feels like it will continue in the same vein as the two pervious ballads. But then Fripp and the gang seem to want to push the idea of the music being experimental, of a higher `art', as they experiment with various instruments for a good twelve minutes. It is essentially `noodling', and makes for a rather dull and unmemorable song.<br /><br />After the only weak song, the album closes in fine style with the dreamy, ethereal choruses of the title track. This song has always been one of my favourite KC tracks. It really is a masterpiece of a ballad, combining quiet and understated verses with big, lush choruses, packed with strings and eerie vocal harmonies that send shivers down my spine. A perfect ending to one of rocks most influential and important albums.ide cymbals, it is a nice song, and acts as a good contrast to the album's opening flurry. \\"Moonchild\\" seems a little pointless to me, and the only weak song.

B000I5X81K|4.0|Being a huge fan, when I listened to his new CD, \\"Awake\\", I was disappointed.  It was not what I expected.  However, leaving in in the car and playing it several times, I warmed up to the new CD and found that I liked it very much.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|As a die-hard Gerard Butler fan, I thought he was his usual captivating self. The movie had a very surreal touch.  The producer's could have made Grendel more believeable, and not the scary one dimension creature he was. They shouldv'e let the actor expand his role, and given him some contact with the son he had through Satah Polley's character. The scenes seem clipped and disjointed at times. But I still enjoyed it, bought the dvd, and relished watching Gerry. I am also a fan of Stellan Skarsgaard.
B0009A40ES|4.0|What's for dinner tonight?  Squid ravioli or a swordfish meatloaf w/ onion marmalade?  Or what 5 star restaurant has the best bathroom to do some coke in?  These are the type of questions Patrick Bateman (Bale) and his co-workers face in American Psycho.<br />This movie is a satirical look at yuppie Wall Street America.  Bateman does have an unsquenchable bloodlust lingering beneath his pristine corporate image.  But there are some surreal aspects to the fatal crimes that makes you wonder what's factual and what's merely a product of his imagination.<br />The 80's setting is really captured through the music that Patrick Bateman listens to and adores.  And yes, there is a strong hint that if you love Huey Lewis, Phil Collins, Robert Palmer, and Whitney Houston, you're crazy too.<br />Plus you're probably a little psycho if you use six different facial & body cleansers, along with your daily mudd mask, anti-aging eye balm, and after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol (because alcohol dries the skin).<br />There are many other instances where this movie pokes fun at vain and shallow people.  It also leaves unanswered questions that are fun to contemplate.  I give it a big thumbs up.
078322611X|5.0|I remember first watching this movie with my parents shortly after it came out on video.  I was not a fan of baseball and basically thought I'd hate it.  Wow was I ever wrong.  I absolutely loved the movie.  And the music is beautiful.  James Horner outdid himself in this movie.<br /><br />Well when I saw that the two disc anniversary edition was coming out I ordered it right away.  The bonus features are great.  There's a story on how the movie came to be, a biography on W.P. Kinsella (the author of the book), commentary, and much more.<br /><br />But those features on the DVD are not why I bought it; I bought it because this movie is just incredible.  It makes you believe that the impossible really can happen.  The messages that Ray (Kevin Costner) gets give me the chills...the way in which they are delivered is great.  'If you build it, he will come,' 'Ease his pain,' and 'Go the distance.'  Well this movie certainly went the distance.<br /><br />The music is what really makes the movie great.  The music we hear towards the end of the movie give me the chills and it just makes me cry...in a good way.<br /><br />You don't have to like baseball to like this movie.  This is a movie with a very special message.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  You will love it.

B000J3EEBY|3.0|I bought a couple of copies of this CD when it was released, one as gift for my wife and one for a friend of ours.  Overall, I enjoy it, but not as much as some of her other works.   <br /> <br />One thing that troubles me; Loreena McKennitt takes a writing (music) credit for the song Sacred Shabbat.  However, the tune is a Turkish folk song called Uska Dara, which was covered by (of all people) Eartha Kitt and can be heard on some music sites.  I spent a lot of time in Turkey growing up and I recognized the tune on An Ancient Muse.
0394800184|5.0|I love to send books by PD Eastman to my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter because I can always count on the same response: She LOVES his books! Carries the new one around and tries to entice any handy adult to read it to her. Why are they such a treasure? I haven't a clue; they just possess some sort of magic that a 3 1/2 year old thinks is the right stuff. That's good enough for me. I am going to be very sad when we run out of Mr. Eastman's books.
1931559317|2.0|The last thing I needed was another atlas. I have several---including all the popular and expensive ones!  I also have the basic and inexpensive.  I have finder chart books and finder chart cards. I have field guides and beautiful presentation atlases. I have lots of software too---planetarium modeling software and charting software. Did I need this new pocket atlas? No! But I must confess that I enjoy maps and charts so this was a necessary addition to my collection.  Keep that in mind: I have a built-in liking for charts so it would take a lot for me not to like a  chart book!<br /><br />First impression. I like the size, the feel of the paper---though not laminated it should be durable---and the design which allows the book to lay flat. Why aren't all atlases spriral bound?! I like the look of the charts---very familiar as it's pretty much a chopped up copy of my Sky Atlas 2000---<br /><br />Now it gets dicey. The publishers say in the forward that they didn't want pages too small to be useful. I think they missed. In my opinion, the areas covered are annoyingly small. Had a lunar atlas format been followed---i.e., show me a large area divided into perhaps 8 charts, with the overview giving some detail, great. This is is missing. Or at least lacking. There are overview pages but they are not particularly useful unless you know exactly what you are are looking at.  And I suppose that is the heart of the matter. If you know where M51 is but need to refine your position a bit by checking a reference, this pocket guide will help you--it certainly is not lacking in detail for a small atlas. But if you are trying to find M51, even with the right chart opened before you, you may have difficulty placing that piece of sky in relationship to what you see over your head.<br /><br />OK. So what's better? For a pocket guide, I greatly prefer \\"Objects in the Heavens\\" by Peter Birren.  His pocket guide is far more logically designed and contains much, much more information. I personally have purchased many of Peter's guides and given them as gifts to budding astronomers and each time they just seemed to know what to do with his book. I doubt that will be the experience I have when I give away the extra copy of this pocket guide.<br /><br />Will I keep mine? Sure. I can make use of it. Do I recommend it? Only if you're a collector of atlases...Try Objects in the Heavens instead.<br /><br />CoffeeManmany of Peter's guides and given them as gifts to budding astronomers and each time they just seemed to know what to do with his book.

B000K7VHQE|3.0|WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS (SORT OF)<br /><br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" attempts to blend two genres - the dysfunctional family study and the road-trip movie - and occasionally succeeds. There are a number of funny bits, but overall the movie is closer to a tragedy than a comedy.  The Hoovers are not a happy family, their road trip is marred by death, and Olive does not triumph at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Abigail Breslin is perfect in the title role, and many of the adult actors' performances are quite funny; Alan Arkin is particularly good. But overall, the movie misfires almost as often as it succeeds.  As I watched, I couldn't help but think how much better it would have been if the \\"Seinfeld\\" cast had performed it.

B000IOM1RI|4.0|I've always been a fan of Jack Black. I like how he takes the music so seriously, yet has a lot of fun with the lyrics and creation of the songs.<br /><br />The movie Pick of Destiny was pretty good, although ended without ending. If you are a fan of tenacious D, you will like this soundtrack. Its got fun songs, awesome melodies, and memorable lyrics that will crack you up.<br /><br />If you take life too seriously, you won't get jack black and you won't enjoy it either. There are a million bands that make serious songs about serious topics, i'm glad that i can put Tenacious D on to make me laugh, or at least crack a smile. I recommend this to anyone that just likes all different kinds of music.<br /><br />I do have to say in regard to overall tenacious d, that if you dont have thier debut album, get that one first, its much better in my opinion, but this album is a good supplement to it.<br /><br />All in all, it is worth a listen.
B00005JPC7|4.0|Great movie. I didnt really know what to expect when I went to go see this movie. I expected a very typical plot as most movies are without any real need for thinking. However, I was impressed that this movie was different from any that I have seen before. <br /> <br />So movie is about a man who lives his days for the past 12 years exactly the same. One day he finds himself hearing a voice that is narrating his everymove. Eventually he finds help and finds himself scared to death because this voice tells him that he is going to die. He spends the next couple of days trying to change this outcome, while doing a lot of things he has always wanted to do. <br /> <br />Good acting by the characters. A great plot. Something entirely different. Characters are very simple, very common. It was nice to see how other not so main characters were all related at some point.  <br /> <br />Only thing was towards the end it starts to slow down. It takes a while to get going and then at the end it slows down again. <br /> <br />But overall, I highly recommend this movie if you want something different and fun.
B000AL730O|4.0|McCartney's excellent musicianship is very much in evidence here, where he plays most of the instruments on most tracks and all of them on a couple (including flugelhorn and cello). It's still his bass lines that stand out, though. So A plus for musicianship. If you want to be picky, you can say that the lyrics are less than spectacular, that the pop gets a bit schmaltzy at times (\\"A Certain Softness\\" cloys a bit with its bossa nova echoes), and yes, there is what Lennon unfairly called \\"granny music\\" in the track \\"English Tea.\\" But come on. This is pop music. It's well-constructed, smart, and it avoids the schlockier aspects of the \\"sillier love songs.\\" Pop songs often will run through your head even when you don't want them to, and that's probably the difference between a catchy tune and a haunting one (you want the haunting one to run through your head). These tunes are more catchy than haunting, but  they're  well-played and musically shrewd.  If the piano lick and first line of \\"Anyway\\" sounds a lot like Curtis Mayfield's \\"People Get Ready,\\" the rest of the song doesn't sound anything like it and is one of the better tracks. McCartney's (and Lennon's) music always began with imitation, then added a little change that made the work original.  My pick for the maturity-can-be-interesting award is the track,  \\"Riding to Vanity Fair,\\" addressed to an ungrateful friend (one of these consumer reviews says the inspiration was Paul's daughter) who forces the singer to fall back on his own resources. (\\"I'll think about myself.\\") If you're window-shopping, this CD may not be for you; but if you're a McCartney fan, you should have it.
B000GYI32M|3.0|I found the OC to be a very entertaining show the first season. The second season, although not as great as the first, was also fun to watch. The third season was bit of a disappointment, but since I had spent the first two seasons watching, I figured I should continue. Although I found a lot of the new characters to be part of the downfall for the season, I figured that the OC had had its run, and that it was time for it to end. I felt that they had done everything they could have with it and I truly thought that the OC was over and that there wouldn't be a fourth season.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, it would have been fine to end the show at Marissa's death. For instance, fans would have been left with Summer going to Brown, and Seth following her to Rhode Island a few months later. Sandy would have left the New Port Group, and gone back to being a great public defender and upstanding father and husband. Julie would have been thrust back into the \\"Newpsie\\" scene as the new love interest of Summer's father. Caitlin would have been back to reunite with her family, etc, etc. I personally didn't find Marissa's death so terrible. Marissa's character had had a full run. In less than 2 years, she had lost her virginity, smoked, blacked out on several occassions, OD'd in TJ, had three serious boyfriends,got accepted to a great college, and tried a hand full of other drugs. She was pretty much done. The death of Marissa should have been the end of the show. This change would have left die-hard fans of the show thinking that Ryan would forever be in love with his now lost forever, Marissa.  <br /> <br />Viewers wouldn't have had to be thrust into this fourth season nonsense, which in my opinion, is absolute garbage. I don't understand how people can say that the fourth season is taking on the same heart that made the first season so strong. It isn't funny anymore. You have an annoying girl clinging to Ryan and there really is no chemistry there, Summer has completely reformed herself and not in a good way (I miss the spoiled, shallow Summer). Seth also has lost a lot of the gumption, sarcasm, and humor that really defined \\"Cohen.\\" Finally, Caitlin is trying to take over and completely cast out what was clearly Marissa's place in Newport Beach, and it isn't working. <br /> <br />The third season had potential, but didn't really achieve any. I felt that the writers got bored with the OC itself. The characters weren't as interesting, became more irritating, and their quick departures whether that be because of some crime related incident or death only left a mess afterwards (i.e. the death of Johnny pretty much screwed things over for everyone. Ryan became conflicted about Marissa. He questioned going to college again. Marissa also questioned college. Then, they both started awkward relationships).I can understand why the writers chose to make Marissa far more conflicted in this season than she was in others. It was clear that Mischa Barton was going to leave the show early on in the season. However, the one thing that this season still does deliver is a decent soundtrack, and music during the show. It lived up to its musical potential. If you are an extreme OC fan, then it would worth it to buy it to add to your collection.
B000J103PC|3.0|The Devil Wears Prada was an okay book, but the movie fell short of the mark. It wasn't really funny, the added plot elements added nothing to the story, and the best thing about the movie was the clothes. It's kind of disappointing how lackluster this film was, especially considering how much it was hyped. It's basically like a cheap Sex and the City without the comedic banter. Meryl Streep was excellent in her portrayal of the Anna Wintour-esque Mirande Priestley, but that alone doesn't make this film worth watching. I'd just wait for it to come on HBO and not waste the money.

1559408898|5.0|This movie is one of those films that so many dismiss as part of that overtly violent stage that Hollywood flirted with throughout the 80's. Terminator (the first one), Aliens, and Predator. And of these, Robocop is close to being the most masterful. Injecting black humor about a crime ridden city run by corporations, and an automaton that finds his humanity again, Robocop is beautifully directed by the still relatively unknown Paul Verhoeven. It may have been his first real footprint onto a North American audience but it is perhaps his most complete film. The script is not particularly clever, nor does it need to be. It whisks the audience through at a deliberate pace and never lets up until the final moments of the film. It's unfortunate that the studios decided to continue the franchise with sequels as this is definately one of those ideas that is best suited as a single film. Highly recommended.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I am glad I purchased this movie since I have watched it 4 times in 4 days.  It is that good.  Oscar worthy performances by Edward Norton and Paul Giamati definitely helped put this movie in a 5 star category and the best movie of the year.  The supernatural and magical aspects of it were compelling to watch, the whole movie was eye candy, then to top it off the romance was emotional and gripping.  I will know this movie word for word by the months end, wish they would make more like this.

My sister wasn't too keen on the idea of this album at all, but when I started to listen to it, I fell in love with it. <br />It is a great collection of old Beatle tunes set somewhat differently from the originals, but nonetheless a great work of music. <br />The songs brought me back to an era of great Beatle music that has survived through the ages. <br />My 7 year old daughter loves to listen to it over and over again and she loves to sing along with it. <br />I one day wish to see the presentation with my family to enjoy not only the great music but the wonderful performance of this troupe. <br />If you are a Beatles fan, don't miss this opportunity to listen to a truly great CD and dance and sing to some of your favorite Beatle songs!
1401917186|1.0|Just as I found her \\"Goddess & Angels\\" book dissapointing, I have also found that this one was a terrible read. Doreen Virtue titles her book with a very \\"welcoming\\" heading, and then when you actually purchase the book and read it, it turns out the title and the actual manuscript have no relation at all. Speaking as a book fan, Doreen Virtue's writing personality just doesn't do it for me.  I feel she is lost in space and has problems relating to our world, Angels are on earth to help us humans and yet Doreen has problems linking a connection to what Angels can help us with in our daily lives.  Not everyones life is a fairytale, we need real guidance, real information, we need a REAL person writing spiritual books! Having recently read a book titled \\"They Shine, They Fly, They're Angels\\" I am having problems connecting to Doreen Virtues way of writing, the authors of \\"They Shine, THey Fly, They're Angels\\" have a REAL grip to life and how we can practice spirituality in our normal daily lives, also the Author of \\"They Shine, They fly, They're Angels\\" is somewhat rare to find these days, because she is a \\"DOWN TO EARTH\\" Author, and can relate to REAL PEOPLE!  No offense to Doreen Virtue but she would really need to start writing \\"worthwhile\\" material, because as a past \\"fan\\" I'm dissapointed that society has affected her work.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I can't understand why some of the mainstream critics panned this movie?<br /><br />This was one of the best movies out in 05.<br /><br />The Illusionist is a visual treat! in fact more so than in the Prestiege.<br /><br />(a similar themed film which came out later.)<br /><br />I say this because the visuals are on a more personal level with the viewer. Its as if Norton is performing his illusions for us.,as well as<br /><br />his audience.<br /><br /> Plus for those who are students of late nineteenth European history, This<br /><br />story is based in part on an historical event which occured in the 1880s.<br /><br /> In which Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf of Hapsberg, comitted suicide along<br /><br />with his lover. A well born commomner that he was forbidden to marry.<br /><br /> a movie entitled \\"Mayerling\\" was made about it in the late 60's or 70's.<br /><br />The story Eisenhime, The Illusionist is a reworking of that event, into<br /><br />a stylish detective/drama. With just a touch of the supernatureal thrown in for flavor!<br /><br />The performances of Norton and Giamatti are excellent! especially that of Paul G. I hope this truly creative actor is rewarded with an Oscar this year.<br /><br />My recommendation is to enjoy this movie for the escapest treat that it is.<br /><br />P.S. Buy this film, along with \\"The Prestiege\\", which is due out on dvd<br /><br />within a more weeks!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Talk about a challenge! To make a movie which, for all purposes, really has no beginning (that was done in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\") and no end (\\"that was done in \\"The Return of the King\\") is hard enough. Try living up to the bar set forth in its prequel! This movie is spectactular, although it really should be watched in the context of at least the first movie. The extra scenes (about 45 minutes worth) are spectacular, and the extras in the DVDs are masterful. I'm the type that likes to know as much as I can about whatever I'm watching, and I was extremely satisfied with this set.
B000J103PC|5.0|This is a movie that will basically appeal to most any female even passively interested in fashion or having had to deal too often with nasty female co-workers.  Men who see this film will either do so at the bidding of their female counterpart or have an open mind, which is good so long as they don't take the negative stance of some of the male reviewers who are more suited to comedies like Something About Mary.<br /><br />Yours truly loved this movie after hearing many different opinions and, best of all, it recaptured the love I used to have for the fashion world when I was a pretty 20-something with a good shape, yet gave me the hindsight to see the humor of it all now that I am neither of those things.  What people of all ages can get out of TDWP is the empathy one can feel for Andy (Anne Hathaway) as she somehow loses her simple, down-to-earth identity in the competitive world of high fashion due to a ruthless boss and cold coworkers who are all obsessed with expensive fashion and it's many designers.  The shallowness of the industry is poked at, but never in a cruel way, but one that makes you respect it while keeping it in a healthy, light perspective.  It's exciting and silly at once, and that's what makes the idea of this film come across so well.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is my favorite young actresses after Julia Stiles, and she is just the ticket as the girl-next-door turned tempest bait as Andy with those huge brown eyes.  Adrian Grenier is cute and likeable as her put upon love interest and Emily Blunt is funny and sometimes sympathetic as her coworker who is so stressed and wants it all as she takes Miranda's attacks on her out on the new girl.  Meryl Streep, of course, wins hands down as Cruella DeVille-esque Miranda as she obviously enjoys torturing those in the lower chain of command, yet she also shows a vulnerable side that makes you both respect and sympathize with her.  Stanley Tucci also turns in a great performance as he takes Andy under his wing and becomes her friend.<br /><br />The fashion is wonderful, the shots of New York spectacular, and the overall feel of the movie is an amusing clash of glamourous stilettos and sensible shoes.  Great subtle humor and a human interest story of being true to yourself when the smoke clears is what it all boils down to.  It's a trip I wouldn't miss, and neither should you.  This is one movie I intend to permanently own.es her friend.

B000JLTRJ0|1.0|This is a ridiculous disaster movie about some buildings in New York city that collapse mysteriously.  Two of the buildings are actually hit by airplanes before they mysteriously collapse.   Another building mysteriously collapses without even being struck by an airplane.  Give me a break.  Oliver Stone does not even attempt to explain why these buildings collapsed.      If you want to see a more realistic disaster movie about tall buildings, rent The Towering Inferno.
0618680004|3.0|In THE GOD DELUSION, Richard Dawkins addresses some of the toughest questions raised by theists and atheist alike. Upon first glance, this work appears to be nothing more than a God bashing tirade, filled with more deep seated opinion than any amount of intellectual thought. Dawkins immediately reveals the intended purpose of this book by criticizing any and every form of religion with a-borderline-embarrassing passion that almost undermines his self proclaimed intellectualism. At one point Dawkins creates a hypothetical childhood playground argument that concludes, \\"God exists. Nur Nurny Nur Nur. All atheists are fools.\\" (p. 80). Aside from a few ridiculous-and rather sophomoric- outbursts, Dawkins applies several credible references to reinforce his own opinions.<br /><br />Dawkins separates the full spectrum of belief in God into seven well defined categories ranging from strong theist to strong atheist, in which Dawkins places himself in the sixth category; a very low probability that God exists but in agreement that this information cannot be known for sure (p. 50-51). This appears a little contradictory, based on the fire with which Dawkins lambastes any form of religion or belief in God but credits Dawkins with the deeper realization that the existence of God can neither be proven nor disproved with one hundred percent certainty. Throughout this work Dawkins touches on some issues such as the credibility of any attempt to prove God's existence and the basis of human morals.<br /><br />Dawkins systematically picks apart Thomas Aquinas' proofs that God exists, as well as the ontological argument proposed by St. Anslem. This is not the first time, by any means, that these arguments have been put into question but in an effective attempt to avoid the same tired argument, Dawkins taps into some fresh material. Dawkins even goes so far as to quote the Australian philosopher, Douglas Gasking's equally shortsighted proofs that God does not exist; one would hope jokingly (p. 83). Further into this book, Dawkins redeems himself by intelligently arguing the basis of human morals by referencing the Christian Bible's Old Testament and referring to some case studies that display the propensity of member's within any given religion to hold moral biases based on their upbringing.<br /><br />For the most part, THE GOD DELUSION is well written and clearly illustrates the opinion of the author. Theists and atheists alike should read this book; it will reaffirm the beliefs of any atheists and allow intellectual theist to reflect and search for some answers themselves. As for the agnostics in the crowd; if you are a firm in your acceptance to concede that this question may not be answered in your lifetime, you will likely be bullied into believing that you are the weakest minded of the spectrum and probably be won over by Dawkins' argument. Ultimately, the problem with works that are either strongly theist or atheist, is that some of these questions are harder to answer than an authors convictions would imply and THE GOD DELUSION is no different in this regard.urther into this book, Dawkins redeems himself by intelligently arguing the basis of human morals by referencing the Christian Bible's Old Testament and referring to some case studies that display the propensity of member's within any given religion to hold moral biases based on their upbringing.

B0002I10RW|5.0|This crusty, ugly fat waste of a life made another movie. Yahoo. You see the way the mind of a geek loser like him works is the more he OPENS his big fat FAT mouth and does'nt recieve retribution, the more confidence this closet homosexual with a severe eating and nose-picking disorder will do it...will CONTINUE to do things like spit on the American Flag and try his best to make friends at a local college where he would LOVE to share the same interests and beliefs as people 15 or 20 years younger than this idiot. The title of this wonderfull piece speaks for itself...our country is attacked and this cholesterolo decides to break out his James Taylor albums and play flower-child with a barrage of BLATENT insults, low blows and LIES about the very country that feeds a fat crap like him. If you find yourself hating the celebrity of someone like this so much that it stuns you beyond words, and you're afraid to even admit you KNOW this guys' name or his movies because you think controversy is what an idiot like this wants...Rage on. Because in 20 years when this fat sweaty \\"director\\" is living out of a dog house after his divorce NOBODY is gonna remember his name.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Set against the backdrop of turn-of-the-century Vienna \\"The Illusionist\\" uses slight-of-hand story telling and is a visually stunning treat. Magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton)returns to Vienna after wandering the world learning the tricks of his trade. His magic dazzles people but a former romance with the crown prince of Vienna's (Rufus Sewell)fianc&eacute;e  Sophie (Jessica Biel)threatens to derail his career when Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti in a stunning performance)is charged with arresting him or running him out of the city.<br /><br />Director Neil Burger has created a marvelous period piece with an intriguing romantic thriller at the heart of this film. The beautiful cinematography and Phillip Glass' marvelous score are wonderfully recreated on this sharp looking DVD.<br /><br />Fans expecting a lot of special features will be disappointed by the paltry ones included here. I suspect that there will probably be a special edition down the road, because considering the magic the film produces, there's a lot more tha could be discussed/shown. We get a 9 minute featurette with the cast and crew discussing how enticed they were with the material. There's also an interview with Jessica Biel discussing the film (which is an extension of the interview featured in the making of featurette on the film). The best special feature is the running commentary by director Neil Burger (sadly Giamatti, Norton and Biel are missing from the commentary track). Burger discusses his opinions of the actors (he was surprised and impressed with what Biel brought to her performance and points out the little touches that Norton & Giamatti introduced to their characters to bring added depth)to the magic tricks seen in the film whether they be \\"real\\" magic or CGI magic. It's an interesting commentary track but I'd watch the film first all the way through as there are spoilers in the commentary track.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" was a pleasant surprise with its strong performances and deft direction by Neil Burger. I should warn fans of fast paced action thrillers that this film takes its time in unspooling the story but the pacing works for the film.<br /><br />While there are many who insist on comparing \\"The Illusionist\\" and \\"The Prestige\\" (the other movie set against the background of magic)the only thing they share in common is a mystery and the magic. In \\"The Illusionist\\" the magic background is used for a romantic mystery-thriller while \\"The Prestige\\" uses the same backdrop for a tale of obsession, rivalry and revenge. Beyond that the films have little in common (including the way the stories are told). Comparing the two is like comparing the flavor of an orange and a tangerine--they're both fruit, both citrus but both have their own unique flavor. Sure some people will prefer one to the other but that doesn't mean one is inherently superior to the other--it depends on one's preference.hould warn fans of fast paced action thrillers that this film takes its time in unspooling the story but the pacing works for the film.

I say that because of all their albums, A Change of Seasons most closely resembles the style of this album in my opinion. All the DT albums are simply must haves. I have enjoyed each and everyone of their albums. They are great albums to listen to on an mp3 player while working out because you will just lose yourself in the long intricate songs and cycling or running on a treadmill will just fly while you're enjoying the music.

B000003FMY|4.0|I was very excited when I found this recording of \\"Pictures at an Exhibition,\\" however I have been slightly disappointed.  Musically the performance is amazing, and is without a doubt the best that I have ever heard.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of background/\\"white\\" noise in the recording that becomes very noticeable especially in the softer moments of the piece.  It's almost like hearing nails on a chalkboard.   <br /> <br />This \\"white\\" noise goes away by turning the volume down, however the music suffers from this as well.  I have not had this problem with other CDs/recordings.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|What does a network do with a series that quickly gains a massive cult following, is attracting good reviews from television critics, and is created by an award-winning writer who has already got two popular shows under his belt, a master plan for this current show and a team of excellent cast, crew and writers? Why, you cancel it of course! But not before airing the episodes out of order so that the weekly narrative makes little sense. \\"Firefly\\" was an exciting new series from Joss Whedon, the creator of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and its spin-off \\"Angel\\", which had everything going for it: an interesting concept, a fascinating overarching narrative, a variety of subplots and plenty of loveable characters. <br /> <br />Set in three hundred years into the future, our earth has been abandoned - long since inhabitable for human life. Like the early colonists establishing new homes in America, humanity has spread across the galaxy to terraform various other planets, some rich in resources and government sponsorship, others dumped with only a few supplies to fend for themselves. As the publicity tagline announced: \\"It's a whole new frontier\\". Therein lies the uniqueness of the series, for the show is better described as a Western rather than a science-fiction show, complete with prostitutes, preachers, mercenaries, saloons, shoot-outs, stake-outs, cattle rustling, train heists, and absolutely NO aliens. <br /> <br /> Recently the universe has been at war; the Alliance fought for unification between the planets and was ultimately successful in this endeavour. Since then the Alliance has governed the planets, not quite as badly as the Galactic Empire, but closely enough for Malcolm Reynolds (who fought for independence) to seek out the emptiness of space. On board his firefly-class ship Serenity, Captain Reynolds has gathered together a bickering, subordinate, endlessly loyal crew who share his desire to out-fly the shadow of the Alliance. There's his old army comrade ZoeWarren and her husband (and ship pilot) Hoban Wash, the untrustworthy mercenary Jayne Cobbs, cheerful Kaywinnet \\"Kaylee\\" Lee, wise Shepherd Book (a preacher who appears to conceal a secret path) and the lovely `companion' Inara Serre. In typical Whedon style, Inara does not only inhabit the `whore-with-a-heart-of-gold' stereotype, but transcends it. In this future, Companions are specially trained and highly respected members of society, and this particular one shares an unspoken love (but very outspoken antagonism) with Captain Reynolds. This crew will take on any job offered to them: heists, robberies, smugglings, cons, scavenging - they don't care much what it is.  <br /> <br />But now there's a spanner in the works. Aboard ship has come a young doctor named Simon Tam, who has rescued his hyper-intelligent sister River from an Alliance institution. Now both of them are on the run, marked out as fugitives and relying on the crew of Serenity for safe passage. Why is the Alliance so intent on retrieving the mentally unsound River? What secrets does she have locked away in her mind? And is she a danger to those around her? As well as the mysterious River, the crew must deal with the watching eyes of the Alliance, the horrifying threat of the Reavers (madmen existing on the fringes of civilization, destroying anything that comes near), and how to get their next meal on the table. <br /> <br />The joy of the series comes from several components, which are perhaps too numerous to list here. There are two of particular note. The first is the imaginative setting. Five hundred years into the future hasn't made much of a difference to human nature, and this is no utopian \\"Star Trek\\" - people are still quarreling, swindling, war-mongering, and generally making each other miserable, a perfect reflection the world that they inhabit. Throwing us headlong into a world without telling us any of the rules, in which language is sporadically coloured with Chinese swearing, where astrange corporate logo `Blue Sun' pops up everywhere, where technology is available only to those that can afford it, where an unknown history of wars, revolutions and space travel has a profound effect on the characters' minds and motivations, makes for exhilarating watching. <br /> <br />Second is the relationships and interactions of the crew of Serenity, making up a bickering yet loyal family unit. One only need see a single episode of \\"Buffy\\" or \\"Angel\\" in order to witness Whedon's interest in the families that one makes (as opposed to being born into), and the theme is even more pronounced here. The crew of Serenity is a mottled bunch with plenty of rivalries and long-standing arguments between them. There's the antagonism between Simon and Jayne, the prickly attraction between Mal and Inara, the tempestuous marriage between Zoe and Wash, the sweet sibling relationship between Simon and River, or Kaylee's role as the little sister of the crew. But when it comes down to it, they are all fiercely loyal to Mal and to each other - how these guys relate to each other makes up the bulk of the drama, humour, poignancy and interest of the show.  <br /> <br />There's been enough lamenting about the unfair treatment of the show by the networks and its premature cancellation; enough to say that the DVD sales were high enough to warrant a movie (\\"Serenity\\") that wrapped up the major plot threads of the series. Together they make up several hours of great entertainment; a rare and intriguing show that hits a home run in almost every aspect of its production (except of course, its cancellation).  <br />

B000I2JKFG|5.0|It goes a bit over the top making its point, but thats part of what makes it entertaining (if it was more realistic it would probably be a drag). Well acted, well made and unique. Stands up to repeated viewings. <br /> <br />The one complaint I have applies also to most HD-DVDs I've seen- having to see the \\"Welcome to HD-DVD...\\" intro/help video at startup. The first thing we should see is the menu (like with King Kong), not some little video, or preview - we should not be forced to press buttons to skip these.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I agree with A. G. Corwin.  It may be \\"dark, depessing\\" but the \\"energetic\\" factor beats them all.  Sure it's dark, it even reminded my aunt of \\"The Corpse Bride\\" (a Great Tim Burton Film).  The sad side of it is mainly death and dying, but it gives you a perspective of how precious life REALLY is.  I Like lyrics, but I don't cry at any songs, not even the famous tearfest \\"Cancer\\" (which is a great song).  This cd is  full of great stuff from the happy, dark single, 'Welcome To The Balck Parade\\", to the harsh, but melodic tone of \\"This is How I Disappear\\", to the break-up melody \\"I Don't Love You\\".  NOT ONE SONG ON THIS ALBUM I DIDN'T ENJOY.  Though it is \\"Parental Guidance\\", it only uses the f word ONCE and the H word a few times a song (even check the lyrics).  Nothing too offensive (except for teenagers to teens, like me but I'm not offended).  If you can handle the dark side, then step in the store and pick it up (usually on sale for $10 + tax).

She started to push the limits in her previous releases and finally came to her senses.  She easily has one of the best voices of all time.  I can't believe that she was ever mentioned in the same group as Britney Spears.  Not even close!

I'm not usually a fan of Live albums but this one really made me change my mind, some of the tracks are absolutely phenominal and make you really understand how Evanessence is in concert.  <br /> <br />The videos on the package are a great addition.  Even when Amy Lee tries to look ugly she doesn't quite succeed.

B00005JP9V|3.0|Visually, Children of Men is a stunner. It convincingly brings us into the terrorist battlezones of the future, complete with immigrant holding pens and bleak cityscapes that are made all the more plausible by excellent camera handling, and a cold color scheme. The acting ranges from very good (Clive Owen) to so-so (Julianne Moore), but the cast mostly does a fine job with what are ultimately very thin roles. Michael Caine is endearing in an ultimately wispy role as a pot dealing comic artist. It's an eccentric little turn, but reads like a screenwriter piling on eccentricities for their own sake. As a result, in the end, Caine is pleasant, but forgettable.<br /><br />But, the real problem with Children of Men is a story line (not premise, mind you) that simply doesn't flow naturally, It is propelled from point to point by very artificial devices that speak mostly of poor plotting. Serendipitous events jar the characters along, coupled with dialogue that says too much -- with a ring of audience spoon-feeding. A good example of this is when Owen's character overhears a group of bad guys revealing what they did, and what they plan to do with Owen's character \\"tomorrow.\\" It felt like a cheesy James Bond moment in which the villain explains his \\"plan\\" for no purpose other than to given Bond sufficient information to save himself. The script, sadly, has a number of these moments, and the result is a story that never quite coheres, and never lives up to its potential.<br /><br />What Children of Men gets very right, however, are those moments when we feel like this bleak future is very possible -- a fleeting glimpes of a New York City mushroom cloud, a bombing victim cradling her own arm, tanks assaulting a London high-rise. Cuaron's work is like a painting. If only he had a better script to paint.

The only one I like is Carrie bec it was directed by Brian DePalma and featured terrific performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.  Cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  Not worth purchasing.  Okay as a rental.

B000IY06CK|5.0|[I am utterly astounded at the negative tone of the previous customer review here of Julia Fischer's traversal of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto and some of his other concerted violin works. The writer's reference to \\"frequent odd noises on the disk, including instrument sounds, fizzing, fuzziness and noises as made with a live audience\\" makes me wonder if s/he got hold of a defective disc. I heard no such extraneous noises. As for the negative comments on Fischer's technical abilities, I can only gape in wonder and assume we must have been listening to different discs.]<br /><br />Julia Fischer is a young German violinist who has truly come into her own in the last few years. She is now recording exclusively for the PentaTone label and they have given her luxuriously refulgent SACD sound and marvelous engineering. She is supported here by the virtuosic Russian National Orchestra under Jakov Kreizberg, a rising Russian-born conductor living in the US since the 1970s (and brother of conductor Semyon Bychkov). Her playing here is subtle and nuanced, marked by extraordinary management of dynamics -- her pianissimi are hair-raising in the first movement cadenza; the brio of her playing especially in the allegro vivacissimo finale is sensational. And never an ugly sound, even in loud passages with double stops.<br /><br />For lagniappe we get Tchaikovsky's two other concerted works for violin and orchestra, the lovely S&eacute;r&eacute;nade m&eacute;lancolique and the sprightly Valse - Scherzo, Op. 34, both played with the same flair and luscious tone as the concerto.<br /><br />Finally, there is the rarely heard Souvenir d'un lieu cher ('Memory of a Beloved Place') with conductor Kreizberg at the piano. I will confess I'd never heard it before and was utterly charmed by this sixteen-minute work with its three movements: M&eacute;ditation, Scherzo, and M&eacute;lodie. (The first movement uses material Tchaikovsky had composed and then rejected for the slow movement of the Concerto.) There is the usual Tchaikovsky melancholy coupled with a sensitive piano accompaniment (sensitively played by Kreizberg). It was so lovely that on first hearing I had to press the repeat function and listen to it again.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonhe Concerto.)

B000JVT1U0|4.0|I have a deep love for this movie, and by buying the extended version I figured I could extract even more from it. Honestly, the added footage is nice and slightly adds to the storyline and character development, but I would reccomend the original version over this newly extended one. Despite other reviews, it is clear when the new footage is introduced in contrast to the other. It goes from looking like a BBC sitcom to watching a movie in theatres. It's very distracting in my opinion. If, however, the quality of video was up to par with the rest of the movie, I would totally reccomend the extended version. It's very sad that the film was lost/destroyed but a fact that most people fail to realize is that there is plenty more footage that isn't in this extended version that was butchered before the theatrical release that NO One has seen save the director and a few others. I would love to see the old footage revived and a definitive director's cut.
0385337388|3.0|This book is a \\"characture\\" of the life of a first-year resident in a large urban teaching hospital.  Like all charactures, certain features are exaggerated to the point of absurdity.  Still, there is much that rings true in these pages.<br /><br />I found Shem's prose choppy and his character development somewhat abbreviated and symbolic, but again the characters were charactures of themselves and not intended to be \\"real\\" in the usual sense of character development.<br /><br />The rules of The House of God are interesting, and a few I found worth actually passing on, like I. \\"Gomers go to ground\\" and III. \\"AT A CARDIAC ARREST, THE FIRST PROCEDURE IS TO TAKE YOUR OWN PULSE.\\"<br /><br />The one thing that Shem captures well is the coping mechanisms used by medical professionals, especially in high-stress medical sectors like Emergency Medicine.  \\"Black humor\\" and sarcasm carry the day in the ED.<br /><br />I've worked in emergency medicine for more than 15 years and I think that anyone who works in the ICU or ER certainly should check out this book.  It is a \\"quotable\\".
B00005A0RI|5.0|This is my favorite jazz record purchase of the last ten years. Once again Haden generously finds a more dominant instrument (piano) with which to match his own tasteful accompaniment and arrangments.  The album truly retains the original Latin flavor of the seelctions yet is bona fide jazz. For me only the great jazz recordings of the \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\" (Jim Hall; the MJQ; and Miles Davis) reach so faithfully and so successfully back to Spanish or Latin American traditional music or boleros but within the medium of jazz.

0783114893|5.0|This is a taut thriller, fueled by raw adrenaline, with just enough character development to keep you emotionally involved.<br /><br />C. Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh turn in strong performances, but Rutger Hauer steals the picture.<br /><br />Hauer is phenomenal as the almost-supernatural villian. Hauer was probably handsome enough to play leading men, but his memorable bad guys in \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Nighthawks\\" and this film sealed his fate.<br /><br />The man can play his face like a finely-tuned instrument. His subtlest expressions telegraph the existence of an unseen ocean of menace. And, when he opens the flood gates, there is no stopping him.<br /><br />While I loved the movie, I hated this lousy product. The bonus material is paper-thin and the transfer is awful. It seems like for about one reel's worth of footage, there's actually a big scratch down the middle of the frame. Unbelievably shoddy craftsmanship.<br /><br />However, it is nice to see the film in widescreen, as the compositions are far more striking than in the pan and scan VHS version. One hopes the studio will re-issue this picture in a nice special edition disc, if for no other reason than to cash in on the upcoming remake.
B00005Q45W|4.0|Just bought two of his CDs -- Ten New Songs and Dear Heather. I have to say I've never been a big fan of him, but after hearing the first two tracks -- In My Secret Life and A Thousand Kisses Deep, in a CD/DVD (pirated) store, whilst travelling deep in Southwest China, I immediately bought the CDs, after asking the store assistant what the music was. All his music resonates with a kind of mellow -- but brooding -- overtone, revealing his innate pessimism. We all know Cohen suffered from dark moods and, at one stage in his life, was suicidal as a result of deep depression. His music is a sort of lyrical narrative on people and their tormented souls -- deeply visceral and intellectual. What I really like about the first two songs, is the voice of the female backing; it provides a gentle counterpoint to the rawness of his lyrics/voice. I've always felt that Cohen's music can be likened to an artistic drawing, a vignette portrayed in chiaroscuro, reflecting a mournful singularity towards his outlook on life. Therein lies his genius -- but, also, the limitation of his appeal.
0375505091|3.0|It is perhaps fair to start by saying that the type of photography done by Ms Leibovitz has never been a favourite of mine. When I ordered this book I thought I might change my opinion. It was not to be. The book  is basically a document of a 15 -year period in the life of Ms Leibovitz or a love story document for that matter. Actually, several love stories unfold while  we browse through it. <br />As to the pictures I have mixed feelings. There are some very good portraits. For instance, the strong portrait of iconic figure Patti Smith or Merce Cunningham's. On the other hand we have the portrait of Scarlett Johansson, <br />who looks awful posing in a rather awkward position. <br />No doubt Ms Leibovitz included the material she felt she had to. This notwithstanding, I think I will prefer to remember Ms Sontag as the rather physically attractive woman she was instead of thinking about her as a patient in a hospital bed or lying dead.

B0007VZ9DK|4.0|In many ways, you can consider Martin Scorsese one of the most underappreciated directors working. After scoring classics with Raging Bull and Goodfellas, a lot of people still wouldn't give him recognition like an Oscar and while the basic opinion now is that he's bound to get at least one for his recent film the Departed, the essential feeling is that they should've given him one earlier. Casino, released after little seen Age of Innocence can be seen as \\"return to form\\" and while it's gritty, unrelenting and quite violent, it's also way too long and you never seem to invest in it that much. <br /> <br />Taking place in the 1970's, Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein starts becoming a bigger player in the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, letting players win enough and recognizing foul play and cheaters. His long-time friend, Nicky Santoro, is a pretty hyperactive and, quite frequently, violent man that becomes well-known in Vegas as a mobster-like figure. While one becomes entangled in the politics of running a casino, the other gets increasingly violent and out of control, especially when it concerns Ace's wife, Ginger. <br /> <br />It's always weird watching a Scorsese film because at times I notice that I actually like the film better when I see it the 2nd time. Maybe it was the hype from everyone but watching Taxi Driver, Goodfellas or Raging Bull I thought \\"yeah I thought they were good movies but where's this 'masterpiece' everyone keeps saying?\\" But then in Goodfellas' case and moreso with Raging Bull, everything started to click. The problem with Casino is that even repeated viewings, it's still kind of a messy movie. It's hard to invest in emotionally with everything, the film's way too long with scenes that don't really go anywhere or just simply a lack of focus. It's certainly a more ambitious looking film than Goodfellas but it just seems a bit too scattered. <br /> <br />How's the acting? Very straight across the board. Before being replaced by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robertde Niro seemed to be Scorsese's go-to guy and he's of course great in the film. While he did show a more restrained menace in Heat, here he's practically vicious in certain scenes and likable. Joe Pesci of course plays the manic buddy who swears constantly and with a short fuse. Sharon Stone actually did receive a nomination for her work here and it was a welcome one too. Everyone else is fine too but primarily the work here is by the 3 leads and they all pull it off. <br /> <br />Is it a Scorsese classic? Not really. What it have been, had certain decisions had been made? Yep. While to me it's still Raging Bull for all-time favorite film of his, Casino is at least worth a look but there's enough to like here, it's just not quite enough.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This was an excellent CD of Celtic music.  GREAT tracks throughout.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I started out being a not-so-big 007 fan. I knew who Sean Connery was(because of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and Pierce Brosman (I still barely remember seing him in Goldeneye at the theatres), but had no idea who George Lazenby or even Roger Moore was. All I knew about the James Bond character was that it was a series of films about a secret agent who used his overly suave style to overpower women and his sometimes-failed wits to overcome some outragouse, unbelievable villain. Heck I didn't even know they were based on novels by Ian Flemming! I simply didn't watch much James Bond 007. One day, a year after \\"just another James movie\\", Die Another Day, I noticed those movies starrin Brosman were no longer showing. They just stopped...  <br /> <br /> <br />Skip forward about 2 years later, I read somewhere that another James Bond movie called \\"Casino Royale\\" was to be released in 2006. First of all, not knowing much about the plot or what it was based on, I thought the title was pretty stupid (he has all these mysterious and dramatic titles like Die Another Day, From Russia with Love, Goldeneye, and Live and Let Die. Then he has this dead-obvious title, Casino Royale, which, in my opinion, made the plot pretty predictable.). Secondly, I noticed what the new actor looked like: blonde hair, EXTREMELY blue eyes, and didn't look near as muscular (at least with a shirt on) as previouse Bonds. I found out other details involving this actor: his name was Daniel Craig and he is against the use of guns! AGAINST THE USE OF GUNS!!!! I knew then that the series was pretty much doomed to end.  <br /> <br />Early reviews show up on the internet, and the ratings were, surprisingly, positive. Now interested in the fact that the movie tells of Bond's first ever mission for MI-6 as 007, I rented several earlier James Bond movies, which were Dr. No, Goldeneye, Live and Let Die, and Die Another Day, and was very impressed with all of them. James Bond had just gained a new fan. Opening night of Casino Royale came, and I was there. I was hooked all the end:  <br /> <br /> <br />The movie opens with James Bond talking about gaining 00 status to a man he kills a few minutes later while showing flashbacks of Bond fighting and killing another person who worked for the man who Bond was discussing 00 status with, all in black and white. This leads to James Bond's famous spin-around-and-shoot-through-a-barrel openning sequence. The theme music, \\"You Know My Name\\", is a nice change from the usual music you might hear in a nightclub, being much more fast-paced than the other films.  <br /> <br /> <br />When I walked out of the theater, I realized that each of the previouse Bonds each had a share of fatal flaws: Sean Connery was too hairy, Roger Moore was too comical and messed up alot, and Pierce Brosman seemed a little caught up in himself and got beat up alot. Daniel Craig portrayed a much-more-realistic agent who was still a flawed human, knew how to get the job done, and only made out with girls when he absolutely needed to, while still having the same ego and style as the original Bonds. Simply put it, this is the best James Bond film I have ever seen.  <br />
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The movie is interesting in that you know from the very beginning that  the lovers will be re-united in the end; they give you plenty of clues along the way. The movie tells how Ed Norton tricked the inspector played by Giamatti to do the right thing in the end. The interesting part of the movie is to figure out how the Illusionist will win his true love. All the acting is good. Giamatti steals the show. Norton is his usual competent self. The cinematograpy is great. Glass's score is terrific. The biggest disappointment to me is that the tricks were all special effects. You don't know whether the illusionist is a trickster or a supernaturalist. The movie really never explains. I'm sure that confusion is intended. Some of the tricks defy explanation in the conventional sense in 19th century Vienna. The only thing \\"The Prestige\\" has over this movie is that some of the tricks were explained. In the Illusionist nothing is explained except for how they fooled the inspector.<br /><br />However, this fault is a small point. On the whole, I strongly recommend the movie. The locket is nice symbol throughout the movie of the love of the couple and life in general. The movie is very entertaining.

B00004Y6NP|5.0|Dire Straits was at its commercial peak in 1985 when the band released \\"Brothers in Arms\\", its next-to-last proper studio album before singer-songwriter-guitarist Mark Knopfler went solo. I've had this album in my CD collection for many years, not playing it much in recent years, but then I listened to the recently released \\"Real Live Roadrunning\\" CD from Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, which features a gorgeous \\"Why Worry\\", a track from \\"Brothers in Arms\\".<br /><br />\\"Brothers in Arms\\" (9 tracks, 55 min.) is of course best known and remembered for its monster hit \\"Money For Nothing\\" (a satire on MTV, which nevertheless played the video for the song in heavy rotation). The first one-third of the album indeed features that song and 2 others which would become Dire Straits staples, \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Walk of Life\\", all hits. But in my opinion, the real genius of this album is not in the hit singles, but in the more introspective songs that come after it, such as the jazzy-feeling \\"Your Latest Trick\\", the 9 min. dreamer \\"Why Worry\\", with an outstanding fade-out, the investigative \\"Ride Across the River\\", featuring great guitar work from Knopfler, and the title track. (Not coincidentally, all those songs run quite long... definitely not for the MTV crowd.)<br /><br />I am generally speaking not too fond of the music output of the 1980s, but this 1985 album is truly a classic, and sounds as good today as it did then (disregarding the \\"Money for Nothing\\" hit, which has aged badly in my opinion). If you are curious what Mark Knopfler is up to these days, check out the outstanding \\"Real Live Roadrunning\\" release from November 06.

0307237699|5.0|For reasons endemic to online commentary of a politically charged nature, I find that too many of the reviews posted here neglect to value the simple fact that this book is a good, solid read.  Lucid, forthright, and deeply engaging, The Audacity of Hope is a commendable piece of writing not only by \\"the junior senator from Illinois\\" but *within* the longstanding genre of American political biography.  For that reason in particular, I recommend this book to anyone interested in civic understanding, U.S. history, and the life of a reflective, conscientious man. <br /> <br />In our culture of mass-mediated, \\"winner-take-all\\" political partisanship, it's distressing to see folks' reading *determined* by ideological position-taking at the outset.  This book resists such a mode of reading.  To be sure, The Audacity of Hope lays out certain of Senator Obama's own political, cultural, and moral positions (while duly respecting those of his colleagues and detractors).  But this book ultimately has a higher aim: that of fostering debate among *all* Americans by raising important political, cultural, and moral issues in a sincere, forthright manner. <br /> <br />I've not encountered a recent political biography more thoroughly committed to the idea that what's important in our culture of reading is making political debate open, meaningful (not reduced to soundbites), and accessible to all (written in a non-patronizing yet intelligent fashion).  In its very narrative style, then, The Audacity of Hope reflects Senator Obama's stated desire to avoid partisan bickering and to help U.S. political discourse return to its genuinely democratic roots. <br /> <br />So pick up this book for the anecdotes (one of my favorites involves Senator Obama meeting Senator Robert Byrd for the first time in Washington); pick it up for a civic education; and pick it up for honest debate.  But don't pick it up to unilaterally impose your politics on it: reading this book encourages reflection and meaningful debate, not rehearsing the undemocratic vitriol that pollutes our airwaves more and more each day.

6302561841|3.0|Charlie Chaplin was minimally a Communist fellow traveler.  A staunch supporter of the Soviet Union, he once told an interviewer with the \\"Daily Worker\\" that we should \\"Thank God for Communism.\\"  At the very best, Chaplin could be described as a naive utopian.  \\"Modern Times\\" was a not so subtle attack against American capitalism.  Chaplin's Little Tramp is presented as a victim of a social system which victimizes the working class. The modern world is alienating human beings from their authentic selves.  A class war exists between the haves and the have-nots.  Employers exploit their workers and deserve to be sabotaged and ripped off. Factories allegedly turn the individual into a robotic creature to be pitied.  Chaplin focussed exclusively on the negative aspects of the \\"Modern Times\\" of the early twentieth Century---and never paid the slightest attention to its overwhelming benefits.  Aesthetically speaking, I also fail to appreciate Chaplin's slapstick brand of humor.  It seems too over the top.  Paulette Goddard, for instance, portrays Chaplin's impoverished romantic interest.  Still, her hair and lipstick always look perfect.  The unsophisticated audiences of over seventy years ago were much easier to please. Charlie Chaplin would be a nonentity in 2007.<br /><br />David Thomson<br /><br />Flares into Darkness

But there are a few scenes which I think detract from the overall impact of the film. <br />- There's a scene dramatizing Gore's presidential loss. This is totally out of place in the movie and unnecessary. This diminishes the value of the movie as many republicans will see this as evidence of a liberal bias and use it as an excuse to ignore the overall message of the movie. <br />- The movie had several scenes that were overly depressing. Gore's 6 year old son almost died when hit by a car, and his sister died of lung cancer. And this has what to do with global warming? <br />- At one point I think the movie is trying to make a statement about how warming is worsening disease. Starts out talking about mosquitos moving to higher elevations because of warmth. That progresses naturally to talking about mosquito born illnesses, but then suddenly the movie is listing all sorts of new diseases that have emerged in recent years that have nothing to do with global warming. The worst one mentions bird flu. This is one case where global warming could actually help. Flu outbreaks are usually milder in warm weather, yet the overall tone of this scene blames all new illnesses on global warming. Thats very misleading. <br /> <br />But again, overall, on balance its an excellent must watch film.
B00005N5S5|4.0|In one of the most intelligent and unhesitating science fiction films of the 1950s, Robert Wise equipped \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" with technical marvels, chief among them the huge robot Gort--the prototype, Michael Rennie suggests, for a global police force... Similar mechanical giants have been lumbering out of space-ships ever since...<br /><br />In \\"Devil Girl from Mars,\\" the giant refrigerator robot Chai hunts for virile Scotsmen and find John Laurie, while in 'Target Earth,' the Venusian robots imitate Gort in projecting rays from their heads but take the idea a step further and make the rays lethal...<br /><br />In Stanley Kubrick's 'mythological documentary,' HAL 9000 computer is the most human character in the movie... But in James Cameron's breakthrough feature, there is, indeed, 'a storm coming in.' His 'Terminator' is a systematic metal, 'surrounded by living tissue,' an invulnerable cyborg, part man, part machine, with whom 'it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.'<br /><br />The film opens with two naked men appearing in two different parts of Los Angeles' darkened streets... One is tall and powerfully built, the other is compact and muscular... Both men seek the same person, a small and delicate blond woman by the name of Sarah Connor...<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrifying as the 'killer cyborg' who 'looks like Death rendered in steel.' He has searched the phone book and brutally shot to death other unfortunate women who bear the same name... He is sent back from the future to present-day (1984) to kill the mother of an unborn enemy...<br /><br />Schwarzenegger moves with inhuman speed bounding like a panther, scanning methodically with dominated blue eyes his surroundings, and in a perfect simulation of voice, he is on the track of his victim... He examines his weapons with precise movements, drives expressionlessly, and kills without pity, or remorse, or fear... It is a role that suits his talent perfectly...<br /><br />Michael Biehn seems scared by traumas of others wars... His face outlines a long burn scar... He tries to stop Schwarzenegger's attempts to be carried out... He is sinister in his long coat... His whole life has been combat... He identifies himself as Reese, a soldier from the future, assigned to protect Sarah at all costs... For him it is an honor, a chance to meet the legend... We feel his pain and anguish when he said: 'That terminator is out there. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!'<br /><br />Linda Hamilton is quiet convincing as the strong innocent prey, targeted for termination, momentarily disoriented, vaguely disturbed... She feels a blind panic boiling up within her, a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine... She is in a daze, paralyzed, shivering silently, uncontrollably... Her fragile personality disguises a hidden force she did't know she had...<br /><br />Cameron makes a successful move behind the lens in one of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...others wars...

B00005JOLI|3.0|I haven't read the book, but thought the trailer looked interesting - some stories aren't great books, but can be great movies.  Well, all the criticisms that this work is DERIVATIVE are completely warranted.<br /><br />For the first 20min or so, it felt like I was watching a fantasy version of the original STAR WARS [** Mild, General, Thematic Spoilers ahead **] - A restless farm boy raised by his uncle wanting to experience the world outside which is dominated by an evil empire.  Boy is rebellious and whiney, but is taken in by a mysterious and knowledgeable mentor who has access to secret magic.  The boy has the potential to tap the same power, so the mentor tries to teach him.  He has visions of a princess who is being tortured and is compelled to make his way into an impenetrable fortress to rescue here.  He's even joined by a dark \\"heroic rogue\\" that could've been played by a young Harrison Ford.<br /><br />So, I've explained how it borrows heavily from George Lucas' A NEW HOPE, but it doesn't end there.  The concept of magic is lifted directly from Ursula Le Guin's EARTHSEA.  It's a cool concept, but unoriginal.<br /><br />The entire relationship between dragon and rider is clearly lifted from Anne McCaffrey's DRAGONRIDERS series.  Again, this is well-done, but clearly borrowed/swiped/inspired (you choose your preferred term) by other work.<br /><br />Where it wasn't derivative, it was predictable.  When it wasn't predictable, it was overly sentimental.  When it wasn't sappy, it was juvenile.<br /><br />The Acting was largely weak, even from actors who have proven to be capable of much better performances (akin to the weak performances from great talent in Lucas' latest trilogy).  So many scenes should have been re-shot in order to get a more believable, compelling performance.<br /><br />On the positive side, the Special Effects were awesome.  I got the distinct impression that some enterprising producers realized there was a gaping hole this holiday season that has recently been filled with big-budget fantasy films (eg, LOTR, Harry Potter, or Chronicles of Narnia).<br /><br />This felt rushed and definitely targeted at a younger audience.  All in all, it felt like a really good Sci-Fi original movie.  I like a lot of Sci-Fi original movies, but I don't spend full price to watch them in a theatre.<br /><br />If you're a fantasy fan, Eragon is worth a rental on DVD.  I'll probably buy it for my boys.  It's a film I would've loved to have seen a few decades ago when I was a pre-teen.<br /><br />This could have been much, much better, but just turned out to be completely mediocre.  A disappointment.is holiday season that has recently been filled with big-budget fantasy films (eg, LOTR, Harry Potter, or Chronicles of Narnia).   <br /> <br />This felt rushed and definitely targeted at a younger audience.

B00008PC2O|4.0|A strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a figure in a sphere of energy... It is the figure of a naked man... 'Terminator' has come through... He stands, and impassively surveys its surroundings...<br /><br />His physique is massive and perfect... His face devoid of emotion... He's not here to kill Sara Connor... His mission now is to protect the future savior of mankind, her son John... Thirty years from now, Terminator was reprogrammed to be John Connor's protector here, in this time... Terminator would never leave him... Terminator would never hurt him... Terminator would die to defend him against any danger...<br /><br />But Skynet, the computer which controlled the Machines, sent an advanced prototype back through time, to destroy the leader of the human Resistance, little John...<br /><br />T-1000 is very menacing... His features are handsome bordering on severe... Its face is simple, unformed... His eyes are gray ice, penetrating... He is certainly not built like Terminator with complex hydraulics and cables... He is human-shaped but far from human...<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the super-hero... He never threatens, that's a human thing! He just takes... He can jerk any knife out without slowing a stride... His hand blurs out like a striking cobra...<br /><br />We watch him smashing the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand... And when the bullets rake his chest, he doesn't even draw back... We observe him in slow motion how he fights for control, how he jumps his bike, sweeps a street kid off his machine with one arm and swings him in front of him...<br /><br />Robert Patrick is a super-villain, a perfect chameleon... He can change shape and color... He can imitate anything it touches, anything it samples by physical contact, any object of equal size...<br /><br />He is a 'killing machine' with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society... He looks and acts exactly like a 'cop' but with quite a few surprises... His arms and fingers can be turned smoothly into something else... He spins at a sound... His blow is lighting fast... He pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol... He is cool, alert, confident in his power... His expression emotionless and judgmental...<br /><br />Linda Hamilton is not a mission priority... She is the same woman we remember from last time... Her body is straight and taut... Her arms are lean and muscular... Her eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered animal... Her voice is a low and chilling monotone... Her expression cold and impassive... She is defiant and intense... She looks hard...<br /><br />Hamilton seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.. She draws her knife from its belt sheath, and idly starts to carve something on the table top, the letter \\"N.\\" Something changes in her eyes... Her face is an impassive mask... We see the forces at war behind her eyes... She has become a 'Terminator,' intending to change the future somehow...<br /><br />Edward Furlong is young John Connor... He is a ten-year tough delinquent, targeted for termination... He has short yellowish hair and a sullen mouth... His eyes reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel... His interactions with his 'protector' give the movie effective moments of psychological depth...<br /><br />He reluctantly shows his friend a shot of his mother, pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border... John doesn't know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years, and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in time to become his father...<br /><br />Joe Morton is Miles Dyson, the star of the Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation... He is a man in a hurry, a man with much to do... He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.. In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor... He can be theman most directly responsible for 3 billion deaths on August 29th, 1997... The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day, will live only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Machines...<br /><br />His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching terror... This is a man ripped out of normal life into a grim world... He looks up, through his pain and incomprehension, and asks himself: Why is this nightmare happening?<br /><br />The level of violence in Cameron's film is pretty intense...

B00008G9JO|4.0|For myself, I prefer the 3rd Jethro Tull line-up. For my listening pleasure, the best Tull tracks included Barriemore Barlow drumming. Here again, with HEAVY HORSES, you are allowed into the genius that is JT. The tune \\"Pussy Willow\\", comes to mind. A gentle sonata, leading the listener to a series of Martin Barre's tightly-held chord progressions. And concluding with a three-part harmony clearly of note. Just buy it . You will obtain many hours of listening enjoyment. And here again, any self-respecting TULL fan already has this CD.
B000AP04OM|5.0|If \\"West Side Story\\" was the best musical film of the sixties, then \\"The Sound of Music,\\" adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular...<br /><br />With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)--and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, \\"The Sound of Music\\" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones...<br /><br />The film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley... It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...<br /><br />There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo... Maria's music lesson to the children, \\"Do-Re-Mi,\\" is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry... And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, \\"Edelweiss,\\" with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and Hammerstein...<br /><br />Another of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the \\"adorable\\" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...ment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem...

B00008G9JM|4.0|Just a brief note for rock-music historians. Shortly after the release and critical acclaim of the Thick As A Brick recording, both fans and critics alike were anxiously awaiting Tull's next musical effort. Passion Play just built on the foundation already laid by Thick. Just skip the first 4 minutes of, the \\"Hare Who Lost His Spectacules\\" track, and you will have a CD worthy of any Tull collection.
B00003CXCW|4.0|Billy Wilder, a refugee from Hitler's Germany, wrote and directed a large number of excellent films marked by his sardonic view of life...<br /><br />On the heels of \\"Double Indemnity,\\" a drama of sexual corruption, came \\"The Lost Weekend,\\" with Ray Milland as a hopeless dipsomaniac; then \\"A Foreign Affair,\\" with Jean Arthur as a naive, idealistic American congresswoman pitted against amoral Marlene Dietrich in postwar Berlin; and \\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" in which Gloria Swanson gave a magnificent performance as Norma Desmond, a silent screen actress who, twenty years after her last film, still believes she lacks only the proper vehicle for a return to the screen... Her relationship with a calculating young writer, played by William Holden, drives her over the edge into madness...<br /><br />The film is packed with unforgettable moments: Swanson and Erich Von Stroheim, who plays her husband and former director, conducting a funeral procession at night for her pet chimpanzee; Swanson visiting Cecil B. DeMille on a movie set and coming radiantly to life when the electricians turn powerful lights on her face; Swanson, totally mad, being taken away by the police as Von Stroheim tells her that he is about to shoot a scene that calls for her, as Salome, to descend her palace steps...<br /><br />No other film has dealt as powerfully, and as bitterly, with the impermanence of the illusions spun by Hollywood...
055358202X|5.0|A Feast for Crows is an excellent continuation of this series. As those of us who have followed know only too well Martin does not give his main characters infinite saving throws.  Just as in real life people in dangerous situations often suffer negative consequences regardless of how well we like them.  Some may say that we see little or nothing of some of the more interesting characters from the previous books.  But those of us who are addicted to the Song of Ice and Fire see this as a promise for the next book. I'm jonesing already!
B00005U8EM|5.0|After living the same day over and over again, Bill Murray's character undergoes profound changes in his relationship with life. He wakes up with the girl of his dreams and thinks he has broken out of his repetitive cycle. He's not certain, so he feigns pinching himself to make sure he's not dreaming. Ultimately the pinch tells us far more about the abiding world view of Phil Conners  than the whole rest of the movie. Watch for it near the end. The irony is very subtle and so sweeet!
0783240287|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this production.  We had seen several versions in the theater and loved most of them, but this became the definitive recording for us.  However, why didn't they also release a CD of the soundtrack.  Only the DVD is available.  I have two other CD recordings of the play (including the 1992 Canadian Cast version with Donny Osmond) which are good, but I really want this movie version's soundtrack.

B000001IQH|4.0|Despite the mohawks, the fake Brittish accents, the tattoos, the sneering and the corny lyrics you nonetheless still have the foundation for a good rock band.<br /><br />It is easy to analyze Rancid in that they have effectively stole all of the essential elements from the 1970's punk bands. The aching vocals of the Clash, the crunch of the Sex Pistols, the bottom heavy sound of the Jam, the thick-toned ska of Madness and the sneer of Generation X to make a gumbo of the ingredients from  the best of the past.<br /><br />Is it a rip off? Maybe.<br /><br />But, on the other hand, most music is derivative. If you consider punk a serious and historical form of music then it has to have an influence on other artists 30 years later.<br /><br />Most or all of the great punk bands burned themselves out. With the exception of the Clash, none of them had any longitivity.<br /><br />Rancid took the best elements of this coveted music and, essentially, did it better. They applied better songwriting, better musicianship, better production, more substance in the songwriting, etc.<br /><br />It is silly to call it punk. Punk from the 70's was a reaction to the \\"fat\\" in the music business and lean times for the economic period. There are no poltical issues to substantially affect them.<br /><br />I find this to be a good and enduring work. There are a lot of songs on this disc with a variety of styles. So much keeps on coming at you, song or after song.<br /><br />Not everything is great but there are some quality, I mean killer, tunes here.\\"Maxwell Murder\\" has a killer bass solo. \\"Roots Radicals\\" falls into a throbbing groove. \\"Time Bomb\\" is great and musically muscular ska rune. \\"Olympia WA\\"  employs heartfelt and crackling voclas. \\"Lock Step\\" sounds like an amped up gospel song with it's call and response chorus. \\"Ruby, Soho\\" is a bit of power pop, the most commercial sounding song on the cd.<br /><br />If the image of the band was that of just 4 normal looking poeple, I feel that the music would have received more accolades.<br /><br />It is a quality work from a good band.

B000I0QLZU|3.0|Of the 6 BRD movies I own right now, I'm sorry to say this was the biggest disappointment.  I had the movie on DVD already (and I'll let others deal with the movie as a movie).  I played it back on my Sony 55\\" SXRD via my PS3, and I was just taken back with how much graininess there was in this disc.  Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty and a beautiful movie -- better than the DVD... but the graininess of many of the scenes really did it in for me.  It's not a bad movie to own, but if you're looking for stellar \\"show off\\" material, there are much better choices.
B000IHY146|5.0|I have been waiting for years, nay decades for this long-lost album to be released on CD.  This, the first of Karen Dalton's only two albums is, in my opion, the better of the two.  Karen Dalton has a voice that demands to be heard for one of the most exotic aural experiences we have in the archives of pop music today.  While I have been able to convince a few people that this is Lady Day singing, the arrangements just won't wash for such a deception the be successful for very long.  This is a voice that sounds a lot like Billy Holiday, especially in her latter days, and the choice of material on this album and Dalton's rendition of it are an experience only the lucky few have had the pleasure of hearing.  I doubt she ever will be well known enough to gain broad popular appeal, especially at this late date, but at least we don't have to search for the LP of this on Ebay anymore.<br /><br />This album is a musical treasure.  If you have never heard of Karen Dalton before, buy this and find out what you have missed.  If you have heard of her, you don't need any advice from me.
B000002IWQ|4.0|This is one of Rush's best albums (2nd best?), serious and very musically & lyrically interesting. I recommend it. Check out song \\"Animate\\". Rush is an interesting and unusual band. They've been together for 3 decades and the quality of their newer music seems to get musically lyrically and rhythmically better on average with each decade, though not with each and every album. They've released so much work, that some \\"perspective\\" might be helpful. This particular album (Counterparts, 1993, 4.2 stars) marked a darker harder rougher grungier turning point in their work. It's very captivating. In retrospect, their upward trend started in 1982 with: <br />Signals        (1982) ~3.3 stars <br />Grace Under Pressure  ~4.0 stars &lt;==Rush's 3rd best album ? <br />Power Windows  (1985) ~3.8 stars, nearly as good as Grace Under Pressure. <br />Hold Your Fire (1987) ~3.7 stars,  <br />Roll The Bones (1991) ~3.4 stars, <br />CounterParts   (1993) ~4.2 stars, &lt;==I recommend Counterparts. <br />Test For Echo  (1996) ~3.4 stars, <br />Vapor Trails   (2002) ~4.6 stars. &lt;==WOW! RUSH's best album? <br />[In general with the older CDs, pay attention to re-mastered vs original release, make sure which alternative sounds better to you.] <br />I rate on an absolute scale, so 4 out of 5 rating is really enjoyable music. In my opinion, most big name pop albums rate only 2 or 3 stars.
0156027321|2.0|I had read other reader's reviews before my purchase, but I felt it might be somewhat interesting.  Interesting if you want to read about a young boy trying to discover his religious stand & graphic descriptions of animals eating other animals & his survival skills down to eating the tigers excrement.  Not for anyone who cannot handle the \\"survival of the fittest\\" in the food chain of life.   <br />     I did find myself trying to visualize the events that were described in the book to make it more enjoyable.  Lucky for Pi he was not in the part of the sea that has freezing waters or he would have never survived.  I had to finish the book mainly to find out the fate of Richard Parker.

We can live the way we live because we are linked to the chain of life and this film shows us that we are drastically cutting many links extremely important to life on this planet off of this seemlessly delicate chain by living the way we do.

B00005JOCU|5.0|\\"Dreamgirls\\" is based on the eighties Broadway musical hit (it won six Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Original Score). In 1963, three Detroit black female vocalists, the Dreamettes, start at the bottom but are willing to work hard to make it to the big time. Beyonce Knowles plays Deena Jones with cool elegance, Anika Noni Rose is an adorable Lorrell Robinson, and Jennifer Hudson makes her impressive movie debut as the passionate and irrepressible Effie White.  Effie is overweight and average looking; she does not fit the mold of the typical sultry lead singer. What Effie lacks in conventional beauty, however, she more than makes up for with her outstanding vocal ability and stage presence. The lives of these three women change when they meet the ambitious and slick Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), who arranges for the group to go on the road as backup for the sassy and flamboyant James \\"Thunder\\" Early, played to perfection by the amazing Eddie Murphy. Curtis has big plans; his goal is to break out of the \\"Chitlin Circuit,\\" and garner the attention of mainstream audiences.<br /><br />The story of Curtis Taylor parallels the meteoric rise of Berry Gordy, Jr., who helped shape the careers of many legendary singers and groups, including the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight, Stevie Wonder, and the Jackson Five. These artists, along with Gordy, created the Motown Sound that defined an era and changed the course of musical history.<br /><br />Writer/director, Bill Condon, wisely keeps his main focus on the lives of his characters, whom we come to know and understand intimately. Danny Glover plays an agent from the old school who is quickly shunted aside by Curtis Taylor. In his determination to succeed, Taylor resorts to payola and other dirty tricks and when she becomes a liability, he dumps his lover, Effie. She is replaced by Deena Jones, a more attractive lead singer in Curtis's eyes, as well as a woman he would love to get to know a little better. Under Taylor's tutelage, the group, now known as the Dreams, soars in popularity and becomes a sensation. The story also touches on the civil rights movement (Effie makes a joke about Martin Luther King having a record even though he can't even sing!) and the social and cultural changes that were beginning to transform American society.<br /><br />The film succeeds for other reasons in addition to its fine performances, including the beautifully staged musical numbers that sizzle with electricity, gorgeous costumes, fine cinematography, and skillful editing. There are a few flaws: occasional lines of stilted dialogue and some banal songs that fall short of the marvelous \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,\\" \\"Listen,\\" and \\"One Night Only.\\"  However, these minor defects are offset by Condon's well-written script, which carefully avoids too much sentimentality and contains enough humor to keep the movie from taking itself too seriously. At the same time, Condon effectively explores the ugliness of racism, the price of fame, and the importance of loyalty and personal integrity.  \\"Dreamgirls\\" works on many levels and it provides two hours of solid musical entertainment.utelage, the group, now known as the Dreams, soars in popularity and becomes a sensation.

At the same time, Condon effectively explores the ugliness of racism, the price of fame, and the importance of loyalty and personal integrity.  \\"Dreamgirls\\" works on many levels and it provides two hours of solid musical entertainment.
B000I5X80G|4.0|Great Live album from Neil Young and Crazy Horse from a 1970 concert.  The music is from the \\"Everybody knows this is Nowhere\\" period.   Good music, great guitar work.  Downside is the inclusion of Danny Whitten's Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\" which is the same version as on Tonight's the Night.  Upside is Down by the River and Cowgirl in the Sand.  Great guitar work and outstanding interplay between Danny Whitten and Neil Young.  Play this CD loud!
0767802470|4.0|Bought the DVD after enjoying the video of Das Boot.  My only disappointment was I never figured out a way to get the English language to come on. (It looks to me the DVD doesn't have that option) So I end up listening to it in German with the sub-titles running at the bottom of te screen.  Having to constantly read the sub-titles makes it a little less enjoyable to watch but this is definitely the classic WW II submarine movie of all time.
0812550757|5.0|Originally, Speaker for the Dead was going to be the first book in the Ender series. Ender's Game, although it can stand on its own admirably, is really an introduction to the rest of the series. <br /> <br />The hive queen, the piggies, and Jane were all well-realized non-human beings. Novinha's story added depth; her family made everything that much easier to relate to. Ender himself was also much deeper than he was in the previous book. <br /> <br />Speaker for the Dead is Card at his best. If you're looking for a mere continuation of Ender's Game, I should warn you that this book will disappoint you. Ender's story goes in an entirely different direction, but it's a fascinating direction that adds new layers of depth to Card's universe.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is tragic that Firefly was canceled after only one season, but the season is great to watch. This DVD also includes deleted scenes and 3 unaired episodes. I recommend this to anyone that likes Babylon 5, Farscape, and Star trek.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends was the first complete Radiohead album I ever listened to (with Street Spirit being the first song). Yorke's singing is genius. The music is just beginning to show some of the band's experimental tendencies; the Bends is a great mix of uniqueness and familiar rock at its best. 'High and Dry' soars. Radiohead fanatics love The Bends, but I think anyone who's unfamiliar with the band will like it as well. There are no filler songs; every track stands on its own.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The Illusionist is a fascinating film directed by Neil Burger (Interview with the Assassin) and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Jessica Biehl (Stealth), Paul Giamatti (Sideways), and Rufus Sewell (Tristan + Isolde).<br /><br />Norton plays magician Eisenheim in 19th century Vienna. The Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, is offended by Eisenheim because of his sudden appeal to the masses, and particularly to his wife to be Sophie, played by Biehl, who happens to be Eisenheim's childhood darling and current love interest. Leopold hires Police Cheif Uhl, played to perfection by Giamatti, to pursue Eisenheim and destroy his legacy.<br /><br />The film is filled with stunning visual effects, as well as many plot twists and surprises along the way.<br /><br />The best thing about the film, however, is the performance of the entire cast, particularly Norton and Giamatti who could easily recieve Oscar nods.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+

B000002KGT|5.0|If you listen to this classic, mega-selling album today, you can easily see why it was so well received in the mid-70's, even smack in the middle of the disco craze.  The musicianship and harmonies are excellent;  indeed, all interworkings of the performances are tight, but smooth, not forced, as if every band member was enjoying his or her contribution.  The songs propel themselves forward with a bright energy.  The voice of Stevie Nicks is magical, as you would expect.  Lindsey's vocals and guitar work are nothing short of superb.  Just check out the variety of sounds he generates in \\"The Chain\\" and \\"You Make Loving Fun\\".  (I single out these 2 members because their work hits home for me more than that of the other 3, but ALL members are giving their best on this album.)  And, the band unintentionally (perhaps?) gives us an indication of where we are in the mid-70's, and where we are headed.  The first cut, \\"Second Hand News\\", is a happy, sunny song about the joys of casual sex, which reflects society's attitude in this time before AIDS existed.  BUT - in the final cut, \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", we hear about a girl with a habit, who has to \\"...pick up the pieces and go home...\\", signaling the close of the 70's when rehab became \\"home\\" for a lot of us, or else we began to hide out from AIDS, financial troubles and an increasingly threatening world situation.  Just as people in the 30's sought refuge from The Great Depression by watching fluffy musicals, \\"Rumours\\" was something to help us through an era of change.

B00005ATQ9|4.0|An old film that has aged tremendously. The rhythm is slow, too slow, and it lacks any kind of feeling or sympathy or compassion. It is cold, very cold. This is the portrait of a social climber who is blocked and rejected when he has finally reached the top. Then it becomes the story of his downfall. He has a lot of luck in his life, but he essentially is a coward who uses the army to get out and away, a deserter who shifts from one side to the other, a spy who double-cross everyone, a gambler who cheats all the time, and a gross ruthless and uncouth person who uses every means at his disposal to get to his ends, even women of course. But the film shows how he is then defeated more by misfortune than by any real plan. He is defeated by the young lord whose mother he has conquered, and the details show that this young lord is even worse than the one he gets rid of, his stepfather, a vomiting retching little coward who takes advantage of the very only moment of generosity his stepfather actually demonstrates in his whole life, and this only one time towards him. He surely recovers his estate and gets rid of his stepfather but he recovers no honour, and yet Kubrick does not go that far. He stops short of saying that, though he shows it with the very last images of a sad, selfish, embittered young man who has suddenly gotten older than his age. What could have attracted Kubrick in such a story ? I can only see one answer : the deep cruelty of human beings and the unfathomable inhumanity of human society, aristocratic or not. That may explain the whole career of Stanley Kubrick : human society is nothing but a computer gone berserk.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne

0141187476|5.0|Published in 1945, this novel, which Waugh himself sometimes referred to as his \\"magnum opus,\\" was originally entitled \\"Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder.\\" The subtitle is important, as it casts light on the themes--the sacred grace and love from God, especially as interpreted by the Catholic church, vs. the secular or profane love as seen in sex and romantic relationships. The tension between these two views of love--and the concept of \\"sin\\"--underlie all the action which takes place during the twenty years of the novel and its flashbacks.<br /><br />When the novel opens at the end of World War II, Capt. Charles Ryder and his troops, looking for a billet, have just arrived at Brideshead, the now-dilapidated family castle belonging to Lord Marchmain, a place where Charles Ryder stayed for an extended period just after World War I, the home of his best friend from Oxford, Lord Sebastian Flyte. The story of his relationship with Sebastian, a man who has rejected the Catholicism imposed on him by his devout mother, occupies the first part of the book. Sebastian, an odd person who carries his teddy bear Aloysius everywhere he goes, tries to escape his upbringing and religious obligations through alcohol. Charles feels responsible for Sebastian's welfare, and though there is no mention of any homosexual relationship, Charles does say that it is this relationship which first teaches him about the depths of love.<br /><br />The second part begins when Charles separates from the Flytes and his own family and goes to Paris to study painting. An architectural painter, Charles marries and has a family over the next years. A chance meeting on shipboard with Julia, Sebastian's married sister, brings him back into the circle of the Flyte family with all their religious challenges. Three of the four Flyte children have tried to escape their religious backgrounds, and this part of the novel traces the extent to which they have or have not succeeded in finding peace in the secular world. \\"No one is ever holy without suffering,\\" he believes.<br /><br />Dealing with religious and secular love, Heaven and Hell, the concepts of sin and judgment, and the guilt and punishments one imposes on oneself, the novel also illustrates the changes in British society after World War II. The role of the aristocracy is less important, the middle class is rising, and in the aftermath of war, all are searching for values.

B000JBWWQ0|3.0|The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield started off in book format back around 1992/1993.  It was a self-published novel with an action background that dealt with certain insights into spirituality.  These insights weren't new, but Mr. Redfield did use an intriguing method for bringing them together and presenting them to the reading public.  To sell the book, Mr. Redfield drove all over the United States, getting the small, self-help bookstores to carry his novel.  A store that I'd worked at was one of the places that began to carry The Celestine Prophecy.  Gradually, through word of mouth, the novel began to sell.  Eventually, Warner Books picked up the novel and did some major publicity, and the book became an international bestseller.  This was around 1994.  Because the book gained such popularity, the big Hollywood studios attempted to purchase the film rights to The Celestine Prophecy, but Mr. Redfield wouldn't sell them.  He didn't want to take the chance of Hollywood ruining the movie, plus he wanted to have some control over the situation.  What happened is that he waited and waited and waited until he felt the time was right to make the movie.  Then, he enlisted the aid of Barnet Bain, who'd produced What Dreams May Come and Somewhere in Time.  They got a cast of relatively unknown actors to play many of the central roles with backup from a few strong character actors such as Hector Elizondo (Pretty Woman), Jurgen Prochnow (Body of Evidence) and Joaqum De Almeda (A Clear and Present Danger).  The director of the movie was Amando Mastroanni, who is someone that I'm not familiar with.  James Redfield and his wife, Salle, assumed the roles of Executive Producer and Producer and Screenwriter.  In trying to stay true to his novel and to maintain control of the film, Mr. Redfield made a movie that probably won't be seen by very many people.  Unlike the book, I don't think favorable word of mouth is going to spread about this film.  Though not a bad movie, it isn't one that you want to immediately see again.  You also don't walk away from it feeling as thought you've just discovered a major insight (pun intended) about life and the way to live it.  This movie was a disappointment to me because I enjoyed the novel so much and wanted to be moved by the film.  I wanted to come away from it, feeling alive and full of hope for the future.  It just didn't happen for me.  True, there's a wonderful message within the movie about synchronicity, how everything is made up of the same energy and how we're all interconnected, the power of love, and the evolution of man to a higher form of consciousness; yet, it could've been presented more clearly and in a more entertaining format.<br /><br />The movie deals with John Woodson (played by Mathew Settle), who has just been laid off from his teaching position.  He meets an old friend, who tells him about these mysterious scrolls that have just been found in Peru.  The scrolls are supposed to offer a revelation for mankind on how to live one's life.  John's friend encourages him to fly down to Peru and to check it out.  When John arrives there, he suddenly discovers to his dismay that both the Catholic Church and the Peruvian Government are trying to suppress the information that's in the scrolls out of fear that society's traditions might break down.  Through a set of coincidences, the right people immediately come into John's life, sending him on a journey through the jungles of Peru in search of the scrolls and the fabled Ninth Insight.  People are being killed left and right in a futile effort to squelch the information in the scrolls, but John finds himself unable to turn back in the face of danger.  He's compelled to keep going until he finally has the answers to what The Celestine Prophecy actually is.<br /><br />What this film reminded me of in many ways is a made-for-television movie.  I don't think it was ever theatrically released, but rather went straight to video (or DVD in this case).  Though the young actors try hard to breathe life into their characters, it simply doesn't work for the most part.  In other words, you never find yourself immersed within the movie, identifying with the characters and their struggles.  The directing could've been better, not to mention the special affects.  Not a lot of money was put into the special affects, and it shows.  I think Mr. Redfield inadvertently ended up with the kind of movie that he was afraid the big studios would make.  In hindsight, it probably would've been better if a major studio had tackled the novel and invested a large chunk of money into it and had hired a polished director who could have brought the movie to life in a way that would've attracted people into the theater to see it.  True, Hollywood often does a terrible adaptation of a successful novel, but occasionally Hollywood gets it right, too.  It would've been great if Kevin Costner, or Tom Hanks, could have played the role of John Woodson and Frank Darabont could've directed it.  I wish I had a ton of positive things to say about this film.  I also wish that I'd rented the movie, instead of purchasing it for my film library.  No one ever sets out to make a bad movie, but it happens just the same, no matter how hard you try to stay true to your vision.gh the young actors try hard to breathe life into their characters, it simply doesn't work for the most part.

B000J103PC|1.0|I'm a huge Meryl Streep fan and had heard she is great in this, so I rented it...ouch ouch ouch.  Even Meryl can't save this awful movie. I had not read the book and so kept hoping the film would get better. Can I get a refund from the studio or from Blockbuster? How is it that this film got a circa 75 % positive rating score on Rotten Tomatoes?  It's basically \\"The Princess Diaries\\" for (so-called) grown-ups. And I doubt any woman will be able to get her man to see a film which gives chick flicks its bad name.  <br /> <br />The pretty but very limited Anne Hathaway (who was utterly miscast in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\") repeats her ugly duckling routine that she did a fairly good job with in \\"The Princess Diaries\\". Stanley Tucci gets to do a gay snide Vogue editor (Runway!? Come on people!). Emily Blunt (have no idea who she is) is funny???  She was not funny once! The hot Aussie Simon Baker, who was very good and sexy in the somewhat underrated interracial romance \\"Something New\\" is wasted, but at least we get to see him without his shirt in a Paris hotel room. Anne's cook boyfriend is nice enough, but has a thankless role and I kept wanting to get rid of his Homer Simpson five o'clock shadow/stubbles.  <br /> <br />And Meryl, oh Meryl: you don't have to do these movies! I know you're 50 something, but you're Meryl Streep! \\"Sophie's Choice\\", \\"Out of Africa\\", \\"Kramer Vs. Kramer\\",  anyone? Here she just gets to play Vogue's bitch-on-wheels editor-in-chief with a few soft and make up-free moments in Paris. And don't even get me started on her haircut. Oh, and the many many scenes where she tosses her bag and coat on Anne Hathaway's desk: we got it the first three times! Memo to directors: never insult your audience. Was everyone asleep at the wheel?  And are the reviewers here asleep?  Why are we fed these terrible movies and even more importantly: why do we keep going back for more? And the \\"writer\\" (or \\"typist\\", to paraphrase Truman Capote) of the book?  She must be laughing all the way to the bank.... <br /> <br />Only plus: the killer outfits Anne aka Andrea gets to wear. <br /> <br />Fortunately I also rented a great one to make up for the lousy one: \\"Conversation(s) With Other Women\\" with Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter. Now there's an intelligent film....
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I recognize the humor of highlighting the lost feeling people have in a high-velociy culture that seems so totally foreign in so many ways. However, for me this movie was two hours or so of angst. When it was finally over, my wife and I watched \\"Ghost Busters\\" to remind me why I ever found Bill Murray funny. Guess I'm too shallow to enjoy movies like this.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a wonderful CD!  Vocal harmonies are beautiful.  I can't pick a favorite song because I love them all.  We are still listening to it and it's well past Christmas, just can't bear to put it away.  My 13 year old daughter is in love with it too, we will probably be listening to it in July!
1563890119|2.0|I'm among the few reviewers here who dislike this book. For readers with similar tastes, here's why.    The art is sloppy and, as another reviewer put it, hideous. The colors are garish, the faces are inconsistent, the perspective can be abysmal (ex. bottom panel, pg. 83), there is evidence of tracing or retouching of photographs (acceptable in some cases - p. 186, but incongruous in others). One might call this artistic licence, I call it simply bad. The narrative would take about twenty-five pages in text, but here we have a comic that goes on for 240 pages while offending the eye with ugly graphics.    The story has promise, but seems to try to blow harder than it can. (However, since the entire series has garnered high praise, maybe it really does ultimately deliver.) It is also humorless. Consequently, it was a slog to get through this first instalment in the Sandman series and I will desist from the rest until I can look into the books and see if the art improves.    For readers who, like me, have a more conventional appreciation of comic art, one modern series I am currently reading that I can recommend is Cerebus, whose art is somewhat poor in the first pages, but improves so fast and so much that it is masterful by the end of the first volume, while the storyline is rich and funny throughout. Now that's a combination for a modern comic (or graphic novel, if you prefer) that I can take!
B00026WUBE|2.0|The only song I really like here is On a Night Like This.  This is a very sluggish Dylan album, which is strange, considering he hadn't made a legitimate studio album in almost 4 years (Dylan's last official album was in 1970 with New Morning).  He did do a soundtrack (which is good), but it really wasn't an official \\"album\\".  You'd think he have more energy after the long rest, but alas, no.  It just seems like he's going through the motions here.  Most of the songs here are average at best, with The Band and Dylan sounding like \\"let's get this over with\\".  Dylan went on a tour (recorded for the far superior album Before the Flood) shortly after this album.  Reportedly, he had some of these songs on the playlist, but as the tour wore on, he dropped them.  Except for the song On a Night Like This, this is just very, very bland.  It's now awful like Self Portrait or Knocked Out Loaded, just bland, boring, and disappointing.
B0002234LS|4.0|I really enjoyed Secret Window.  While Johnny Depp was good, I was more impressed with John Turturro. I thought he did a wonderful portrayal of his character.  In fact, it was mostly his acting that made me like the movie as much as I did.  Over all, the movie was good and worth seeing. If you get the chance, do see it and pay special attention to John Turturro's performance.
0440241588|2.0|The story starts with a weak premise -- the CIA wants the outgoing US president to pardon a former Washington power broker, so that they can watch him and see which of several foreign countries will try to kill him. Supposedly, this will give the CIA insight into unanswered questions surrounding the shady deal for which the power broker was originally sent to jail. But since *all* those foreign countries immediately dispatch hit teams against the broker, it's unclear how this plan is supposed to yield the answers the CIA is looking for.    With a premise this unsteady, Grisham is never able to build a solid story. Grisham is known for taut thrillers, page-turners which propel you forward with ever-building tension, complexity, and intrigue. Instead of sweeping you along in The Broker, however, new revelations prompt you to pause. You have to stop to figure out how the new piece of information fits with the old. Half the time it doesn't necessarily seem to. But you know and trust Grisham, so you begin to doubt your own grasp of the story. \\"It's got to be me, not him,\\" you say to yourself. But in the end, it really is him.    Perhaps it's because this is the first time that Grisham appears to have stepped out of the realm he knows well -- the US legal system -- and ventures into territory that, presumably, is virtually unknown to him -- international espionage. It's too bad that the book is so poor, because you know Grisham, and you want it to be good, so you keep at it. But in the end, you wish you'd trusted your instincts early on and put it down.
B00005RHGK|2.0|Lets pretend for a second that it's perfectly normal to write two reviews based on one movie:Heres the first <br /> <br />Jeepers Creepers is one of the most painstakngly tension filled and nerve fraying experiences ive had watching a movie in a long time. <br /> <br />And now the second: <br /> <br />Jeepers Creepers is a steaming pile of crap whose biggest asparation is to be ranked among other tepid monster/slasher(is that redundant) flicks that should be lucky to get more than one pass but who somehow will inevitably land a sequal. <br /> <br />Why two reviews? Because it is two movies ad just for that reason is one of the most frustrating experiences Ive had watching anything.  <br /> <br />The basic plot is this:A brother and sister on a cross country trip happen upon a site covered(literally) with bodies and find themselves stalked by what seems to be the man responsible.he turns out to be something completly different. This unfortunatly, is the exact place the movie turns into something completly different too. In the first half, the movie builds slowly, the siblings relatonship is portrayed realistically as they are shown bickering about just about everything but through it all show genuine care for each other. The tension starts to build when thy come upon the lair of the creature. Of course at this point they have no way of knowing this terrifying spectacle is not man-made. Inside they find bodies lining the walls, looking eerily laminated. Then they are discovered and a car chase begins as they are being followed by a faceless man driving a black pickup truckin in a sequence that plays out alot like the classic movie Duel. All this works terrifically with mounting tension and shock after shock. I genuinly felt and was afraid for the characters. At this point I was so excited to see how this thing worked itself out I couldnt stand it. i also couldnt stand what the movie descended into after that. <br /> <br />Any horror movie that plays on the type of fears the first half of this movie does should know that not only is less more, but that oftentimes the unknown is more terrifying than anything a movie can produce. Especially if after all that buildup, the reveal turns out to be Bat-boy. After that great beginning, the movie disintegrates into schlock jump scare horror with no sense of fun and having answered the question of what the stranger is, the only thing that gave me a case of the willies was realizing it wasnt going to get any better. I did appreciate the ending, at least they had the cajones to end the movie in a way i wasn't expecting, if thy had just had the cajones to give a second half that could live up to the first.
B00011RPB0|4.0|Mostly set in a luxurious, high-rise Tokyo hotel, LOST IN TRANSLATION tells the story of Charlotte and Bob Harris, two alienated Americans tourists who quietly struggle with culture shock, insomnia and loneliness.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte a 22 year old, recent Yale grad whose hipster, photographer husband is too self-absorbed to provide real companionship. Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a fifty-something, has-been actor who has traveled to Japan to earn $2 million making liquor commercial.<br /><br />When the two meet in the hotel's lounge, they find more than a pleasant conversation.  In each other they find the kind of companionship and kindred spirit their own marriages lack.  Though their relationship is strictly platonic, it provides the intimacy, respect and genuine love that each craves.<br /><br />Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, LOST IN TRANSLATION is a magically atmospheric film that completely transforms the bright lights and excitement of a hectic, world-class Asian city.  Here in the bath of neon lights, Coppola delivers the black and white world of psychological struggles, generation gaps and genuine unrequited love.<br /><br />Though I recognize that this is an odd comparison, LOST IN TRANSLATION reminds me of James Joyce's short story \\"The Dead.\\"  Both are like Polaroid's of a memory.  They invite the viewer into a quiet, subtle, seemingly fleeting experience that will undoubtedly have explosive consequences.<br /><br />-- Regina McMenamin
B00005JPC7|4.0|This movie has a lot of interesting things going on about it. The most dramatic of which is the fact that the movie suffers from it's own flaw in the very fictional book the fictional author is writing (let that sentence sink in a bit). Because of this, I think it may propel the movie into being astounding from simply \\"mediocre\\" which is what the characters in the movie come out and tell you that it is. It is literally a movie that admits to it's own defeat, but it does so \\"for the greater good\\" and I personally think it's terrific for doing so. <br /> <br />Anyway, philisophical stuff aside, it was a terrific watch. As said, the visual effects were a nice addition although some may consider them gaudy. As a hobbyist film editor I really go for that stuff, however, so I enjoyed seeing a little \\"scroll-bar\\" come out and alert Harold that something needs doing, or watching him make decisions. It was also a great way to turn a dialogueless boring scene into something interesting (for example, Harold attempts to not move off of the couch, but the \\"heads-up display\\" alerts us that he has to apparently go to the bathroom). The subtle elements like this really make the movie, even if it tries to be about something big - Harold dying, that is.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|I agree 300% with spotlight reviewer, Michael Acuna.  And I will add that this is neither the best nor the worst film you have ever seen.  A classic, though slow, chick flick, MUST LOVE DOGS is comforting to watch for one reason: the indescribable charm of Diane Lane.<br /><br />Another version of the 'You Have Mail' Internet-dating movie, MUST LOVE DOGS is predictable in terms of plot.  But that hardly matters.  The point in watching this film is to indulge in a sweet cast of familiar faces including John Cusack, Elizabeth Perkins, Swoosie Kurtz and of course, Diane Lane.<br /><br />A divorced 40-something with all the confidence, wisdom and wrinkles that come with age, Lane is Sarah, a pre-school teacher, reluctantly tossed back into the dating pool by her sister, played by Perkins.<br /><br />Though she is far more beautiful than your average 40-something, here Lane succeeds in conveying the every-woman qualities that will appeal to ladies of all ages.  Vulnerable, strong, gorgeous, nervous, hopeful and suspicious, Lane's Sarah is the kind of woman every girl can relate to and every real man would love.<br /><br />-- Regina McMenamin

0345350499|3.0|After watching \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" on TNT, a bought the book at my local used book store. I tried really hard to get into the book, but maybe because I'd already seen the movie I just couldn't read it. I got as far as the threesome with Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot and I stopped reading (since that was a highlight from the movie and the book didn't make it too hot).
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I love this movie! Russell Crowe did a MARVELOUS job in this movie. On top of that, Joaquin Phoenix does such an awesome job playing the horrible malicious villain that it's almost awe-inspiring. Kidding. But I do really like his work in this movie (among countless others!). But even if I had never heard of those two characters, it was still a really awesome movie.
1400079179|5.0|I avoided reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" because I was afraid Dan Brown would ruin the theory of Mary Magdalene as Christ's sacred bride. Once the Catholic Church started clamoring about \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" I knew I should read the novel. I was so happy that Dan Brown stayed true to the theory laid out by Margaret Starbird and others.<br /><br />The book's protagonist is Robert Langdon, Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard University, who must solve the murder of the Louvre's curator. Langdon meets Sophie Nouve, the curator's granddaughter and a detective. The two must discover who killed the curator and why. Along the way, they follow clues and ancient riddles The book includes references to the Holy Grail, Priory of Sion, Knights Templar, Roslyn Chapel, and of course, Mary Magdalene. The book even cites \\"The Templar Revelation,\\" \\"The Woman With the Alabaster Jar,\\" and \\"The Goddess in the Gospels.\\"
B000I5X81A|4.0|better than I thought,..just saw Clapton in Birmingham and wanted to check out his latest,...was pleasantly surprised by his pairing with JJ Cale and his band, as well as some of Clapton's band-mates....did not know much about JJ Cale other than source of some of Eric's earlier songs, but found I like JJ's writing style...overall I liked it and I am glad I bought it.....
6305718954|5.0|\\"Stigmata\\" is a great movie. Patricia Arquette stars as a young woman in the U.S. who shows signs of stigmata. A priest from the Vatican links up with her and cares for her as she is increasingly afflicted by the stigmata. Her ranting and raving finally begins to make sense to the priest who starts to question what his religion has stood for. This movie is good on its own account, but I love it because it introduced me to \\"The Gospel of Thomas,\\" the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Nag Hammadi Bible.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I am not a big fan of Disney movies, as the fairy tales always end with a prince rescuing a maiden. However, I was surprised to learn how The Little Mermaid actually contains subtle and noticeable references to Mary Magdalene. If you've forgotten this animated movie, see it again with new eyes.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|If you haven't seen Little Miss Sunshine yet, you absolutely must see this movie. It's a dark comedy starring Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear. Abigail Breslin stars as Olive, a little girl traveling with her family to compete in the regional Little Miss Sunshine pageant. I would recommend this movie to everyone, but especially mothers with daughters who compete in pageants. Olive shows us that inner beauty is the most important quality a person can have. Also, anyone in the Air Force will appreciate this movie as well.

After returning a long-lost childhood treasure to a former occupant of her apartment, and seeing the effect it has on him, she decides to set out on a mission to make others happy. She also pursues a quirky guy who collects discarded photo booth pictures. The movie is in French with English subtitles. It has a touch of magic and makes me smile whenever I think about it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There once was an awesome TV series on Fox that I didn't watch called Firefly. It was advertised as a Western in space. This did not sound like a great show. If they had advertised it as being made by Joss Whedon, of Buffy, with a female first mate, a female mechanic, a female prodigy, and a female courtesan, I would have watched the show! <br /> <br />The female courtesan character, Inara, is my favorite character. She is called a Companion, like a high class escort. She's a Buddhist, which apparently survives into the 2500s. And she has a license to practice her Companion arts. Licensed geishas! <br /> <br />If you like Buffy, or John Doe, or even Stargate, I bet you will love this series. Too bad it was canceled. I blame myself.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Once upon of time this movie was a gross exaggeration of the world's fascination with reality shows.  Sort of a 'how far are we willing to go', kind of thing.  Fast forward, reality shows are still a staple on the networks, but we've learned a new term 'scripted reality' which, I guess was what the Truman Show was.  Everyone in on the act except the lead.  Truman also manage to hit you with a lot of heart and I honestly believe Carey gave an Oscar worthy performance in this role.  Truman's growth and his adventous spirit could not be conquered.  It's an old tale of the creation turning on its creator and one that is still fascinating to watch. Highly recommended
B00005U8EM|5.0|Usually I'm a stickler for wanting to know the how and the why of things.  Like: Why is this happening to Phil?  How is this happening?  However, this is one of those rare times when you just go with it and draw your own conclusions-and it works.  Don't ask me how.  But everything about this movie, from the writing to casting, is just dead on perfect.  What would you do if there was literally no tomorrow?  Highly recommended.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I'm in minority again.  I didn't care for this movie.  It's Diane being Diane and Jack being Jack--just a little bit less crazy.  I wasn't blown away by the romance or the comedy is movie and I absolutely want to stick a sock in Diane's mouth during that long crying scene.  It's not a horrible movie, it's just nothing special.
B00005JPCA|4.0|What's so good about the replacing Pierce Bronsnan by Daniel Craig as the new Bond? In my opinion it's the pumped up body, less hairy chest, and sexier lips. Craig is obviously more of a stud-muffin or hunkiest of all the bonds and the character is changing a new image from the classic handsome look. Put the whole new sex appeal aside, there is a bad bond girl who breaks Bond's heart. The fight and chase in Africa was very exciting to watch. The whole slow-paced drama and romance was a bit over-dragged for the mid-part of the film. There is of course at least 5 scenes that exploits nudity on Bond and not the Bond girl. Not to mention the \\"unintensional\\" S/M torture scene between Mads Mikklesen and Craig when he was totally naked. Didn't the prducers know that a lot of international audiences had seen plenty of naked Daniel in shows like Love is the Devil(gay indie) and The Mother. It's clearly more appealing to the gay audiences than the mainstream straight crowd, and the scene went on for almost 5 minutes that seemed like they wanted to add some Brokeback element for commercial sake. Well, I didn't find the gambling scenes to be that stimulating, but it was the more glamorous mements in the film. Judi Dench is good as always as M., but the role is itself is so limiting and bland compare to say Notes on A Scandal's Barbara. For some reason I was very distracted by the way Eva Green talks and her accent particularly sounded so much like Nicole Kidman in The Hours. That was a bit errie. Do I think she's award-worthy for her deceptive performance of a bad Bond Girl? Not really, I doubt it her one-dimentional role is going get her beyond the Globe Globe supporting actress nomination. As far as action is concerned, I didn't think there was enough. This Bond film is more on drama and romance than action. Ultimately, they have recreated a sexier Bond, and the multiple \\"money shots\\" on Daniel Craig's naked body made it a total eye-candy!

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I am a baby boomer of the Beatles generation who has a difficult time finding new albums to get excited about.  I really liked about half the tracks on John Mayers \\"Room for Squares\\" and \\"Heavier Things\\", but \\"Continuum\\" far surpases those.  It is a great pop album, with all tracks ranked either 4 or 5 stars in my itunes library.  I love the infusion of blues and even motown sounds into the tracks, and his guitar licks are outstanding. While it is tempting to label it as derivative (I always want to play Neil Young's\\"Harvest Moon\\" after hearing \\"Stop this Train\\" for example) he has taken all the aspects of pop music that I like and thrown it onto one album, so who cares.  But then, I am also a big Billy Joel fan...
B00005JP9V|4.0|Twenty years down the road, says this film, the world will be plagued by a number of serious ills, among them radiation fallout--which may very likely account for the other ill that's spotlighted here, a global infertility affecting every woman alive.<br /><br />All, that is, except one. As Theo, played by Clive Owen, becomes gradually more involved in the transporting of the one pregnant woman from her starting point to, ultimately, what is meant to be her safe harbor destination, the Human Project--the group analyzing the basis for the worldwide epidemic of infertility--he is as well gradually exposed to increasingly greater danger from violent anti-government groups and the government militia themselves.<br /><br />Based on a novel of the same name by British writer P.D. James (an uncharacteristically science fiction work by a woman known for her mysteries), the film is directed by, interestingly, Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron who previously helmed one of the Harry Potter movies. Cuaron establishes a dark mood in the film not only by the events, steeped in violence, but also by a surfeit of smoke, fog, and dark gray skies.<br /><br />Here, your supposed friends can just as easily be your enemies and when the only man Theo can trust, Jasper (Michael Caine), is himself set upon by violent forces, Theo and Kee--the pregnant woman--have no choice but to flee.<br /><br />The film is really the odyssey of man in (and into) the future. Though filled with the sadness of violence, the world in 2027 is as well hopeful. This is illustrated in a beautiful scene in which Kee is in essence worshipped by those surrounding her as she walks through a crowd with the biggest surprise in 18 years accompanying her (you will have to see the film to understand what this means). Tragedy strikes at every turn, including at the end of the film, and although it may initially appear that the last image is hopeful, because of the obvious uncertainty of who is friend and who is foe, even that is called into question.<br /><br />This is a strong, thought provoking film that speaks directly to how we have come to destroy ourselves and what (one of) the ultimate consequences of this self-destructive behavior may be.<br /><br />Highly recommended.oe, even that is called into question. <br /> <br />This is a strong, thought provoking film that speaks directly to how we have come to destroy ourselves and what (one of) the ultimate consequences of this self-destructive behavior may be. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00008RWRH|5.0|No other conductor captures the geniality of Joseph Haydn as well as Eugen Jochum and, as wit is integral to Haydn's music, this makes his performances of the London symphonies highly enjoyable.

I use \\"piece\\" as in the flow from first cut to the last. I am still amazed that this is such a young group. They have such a maturity in the words and in the overall music approach.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|This movie was beautifully made. I love watching it with my son (34 months). I just skip through the part with the puppet car because I think that is a little too much for him. He is not scared by the man on the top of the train which I was a little worried about at first, but it doesn't seem to bother him. I make sure I sit with him in case he has any questions, as I think this may have been made for children a little older. My son is in love with trains and this is very magical and beautiful and he really enjoys it!!

I love the description of the town of Salinas' reaction to WWI (Part 4 of the novel)...so eerily mirrors our sentiments to the War on Terror.  There is so much material to discuss in this novel particularly on inheritance both monitarily and in our genes...what traits are inherited from our families.  I wish I had a Steinbeck in my family that could write a memoir of our ancestors.  Awesome book!

B000LAZDQA|3.0|I got in trouble recently because I forgot to mention to someone that a really great film showed genitals and sexual activity. So--heads up, people! Shortbus is all about sex. Not only is it all about sex, but it shows sex and genitals. Actors and actresses are sometimes having sex on the screen. <br /> <br />Now that that's out of way, for those of you into a little love with your sex, you'll find that too. But Shortbus is about all kinds of love: frustrated hetero love, homosexual love trifectas, roomfuls of people who love lots of people at once. It's about love for oneself and love for others. It's about satisfying the need for sexual orgasm and satisfying the need for friendship, attachment, commitment, and more emotional love. It deals with a troubled gay couple, a dissatisfied dominatrix-for-hire, a couples counselor who can't have an orgasm, and a wild club called Shortbus run by a cross-dresser who says the name comes because \\"special\\" people ride the short bus. That's true, yeah, but also emotionally, intellectually and socially stunted people ride the short bus, and you'll find those people, too. <br /> <br />Try not to zone out when characters go off on extended monologues or when the musical scenes drown out the dialogue and drone a little too long, and you'll find some new, fun looks at relationships and sexuality for the 21st century. <br /> <br />My personal opinion, though it differs from my wife, is this film suffers from the collaborative storytelling that involved Mitchell spending two years working with his performers to develop the plot and the characters. It's not as strong as it could have been with a single artist.

038533348X|5.0|I wound up writing this review because recently, in a flight of fancy, someone conjectured that perhaps in other parts of the universe silicon forms four bonds, making ring structures - similar to the carbon-based benzene ring that is the basis of all organic materials - possible.  My question was whether silicon-based amino-acid analogues would \\"teach\\" the silicon in this part of the universe to form the same kind of rings.  Carbon-based DNA teaches raw amino acids how to make more DNA, so that begs the question of whether such structures would propagate.<br /><br />Ice-9 does just that.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle isn't quite as absurd as it seems.<br /><br />Ice-9 is a form of ice with a different structure than regular ice.  It is frozen solid at room temperature.  Further, when it comes into contact with regular water, it causes the water to freeze into more Ice-9.  Given that 4/5ths of the earth's surface is covered by ocean, and that our bodies are mostly made of water, you can probably deduce that keeping the Ice-9 in a thermos where it can't come in contact with other water is an important plot element.<br /><br />A seed crystal is often necessary to initiate a phase change or precipitation, so it is conceivable that Ice-9 could initiate a catastrophe.  The science fiction part is that we haven't discovered a form of water that is solid at room temperature.<br /><br />Incidentally, there's not much danger from oxygen-breathing silicon creatures because instead of exhaling carbon dioxide they'd exhale glass.  They won't be bothering us here on earth when they show up.<br /><br />However, electricity-breathing silicon creatures like the semiconductor nodes that make up the Internet could be a threat.  Google's server network has almost - not quite, but almost - reached a level of complexity where consciousness and intention are possible.<br /><br />Some reviewers on amazon.com thought that ice-9 was a metaphor for the atom bomb.  Since the possibility of thermonuclear armageddon was so over-arching in real life at the time I first read the book, I didn't place any emtional emphasis on that subtext.  I viewed Ice-9 as yet another technology to keep out of the hands of the military-industrial complex.<br /><br />You didn't need to know that Godzilla was a metaphor for the atom bomb and the damaging effects of residual radiation in order to enjoy it.  Cat's Cradle was a fun social commentary that didn't benefit at all from atomic metaphor.  Ice-9 was merely a plot device, a Deus-Ex-Machina that brought about the natural consequences of great social granfalloons.<br /><br />Bokononism isn't the first religion founded by a science-fiction author, either.<br /><br />Like all of Vonnegut's books, Cat's Cradle looks at society and personalities and relationships with a new, slightly mad perspective.  It is hard to walk away from Cat's Cradle without re-evaluating the Granfalloon that is organized religion, or any other carefully-crafted social institutions.time I first read the book, I didn't place any emtional emphasis on that subtext.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|THE ILLUSIONIST is a heavily fictionalized tale of a love affair between Eisenheim The Illusionist and the Princess Sophie of the Austro-Hungarian Empire taking place in the years just prior to the First World War.<br /><br />It is not widely known that the historical Eisenheim was in fact Jewish, that his name was Erik Jan Hanussen (born Hermann Steinschneider), and that besides being a tremendously sought-after spiritualist entertainer in 1900s Vienna, he was later a friend and mentor of the young Adolf Hitler, to whom Hanussen taught many of his techniques for deceiving and manipulating audiences. Hitler might be said to have perfected Hanussen's art, and later repaid his teacher by having Hanussen killed.<br /><br />THE ILLUSIONIST, however, does not touch on these facts. Instead, it is a heavily stylized, darkly atmospheric, and deeply convincing period film which recounts how Eisenheim and Sophie manage to carry on a love affair while discrediting Sophie's fiance, the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary. (The historical Crown Prince, Rudolf, committed suicide after murdering his mistress.)<br /><br />Edward Norton (and forgive me, but I can never think of him without thinking of Art Carney) plays Eisenheim with an understated intensity, as a man convinced of his own rightness who manages, despite this, to never misstep into arrogance. Jessica Biel is beautiful, intelligent, noble, and facile, as Sophie. Both give excellent performances, but the stellar performance of this film belongs to Paul Giamatti, as Police Inspector Uhl, the agent of the Crown Prince, who becomes half-conspirator and half-pawn in the convoluted plan hatched by Eisenheim and Sophie to steal away from Vienna together.<br /><br />THIS FILM IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I adored this movie even as I had a few problems with it. If you at all have any issues with your family,  you will enjoy this film as well- it manages to find the laughs within the dysfunction.  It's silly and moving, and at times a little disturbing.  For me the best thing in it is Alan Arkin as the grandfather and Abigail Breslin as the daughter.  If the movie had been entirely about them, I would've rated this a perfect movie- but the parents are involved, and I didn't find them as believable or interesting for some reason. But there are many laugh out loud moments, and as I said- it's worth it just to see the great Alan Arkin stealing every scene he's in.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|One of the most underrated shows currently on TV, Supernatural follows brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) on their hunt to find their father (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and the demon that killed their mother. <br /> <br />That's the official sounding basics.  Here's my actual thoughts: <br /> <br />Dude!  This is the coolest show eva!!1!  Sexy car, cool music, and two exceptionally hot hotties being all hot.  Oh, and the plots are good too.
B00009NHC5|5.0|This is a classic that is as great today as it was the day it was released 40 yrs. ago. They don't make them like this anymore and that is a shame! A great cast of actors combined with a great script and soundtrack make this a edge of your seat thriller from start to finish! \\"Wait Until Dark\\" means just that! View this gem in the evening for premium enjoyment! Shut off the phone & turn up the surround sound! All you need now is popcorn & someone to grab hold of! Enjoy! Caligula247
6305922756|5.0|i love this movie. i've inflicted it upon my friends....it's just great! so bad-it's-good music, inflated egos, it's kinda pathetic but just....magic. it is magic.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Excellent awareness document on climate change due to anthropogenic causes. <br />However, only 5 minutes dedicated to portfolio of actions to mitigate climate change effects and no comment on the economics of cost of doing nothing versus cost of remediating impact of climate change effects. <br />Needs a part 2 on economics and a part 3 on solution portfolio for further public and political information and full deployment of solutions <br />Claude Roulet/  Schlumberger Carbon Services
B000GFLE1S|4.0|just a really cute movie. a feel good one. a nice alternative to the movies that star outragious drag queens. the queen in this one is a heroine, and not over done. great acting all around. and GREAT boots! a lil something fot the kinky crowd, too!
B00009TB5G|5.0|All the LOTR extended versions are worth buying and keeping.  They are just perfect!
B0000DIJO2|5.0|If you like the Bee Gees....you will love this concert. <br />It is wonderful!!! <br /> <br />They play and sing so many songs on this DVD.  <br />I feel I really got my money's worth with this one.   <br />A great concert!
0060589469|5.0|This book will become one of my favorites very soon. I'm just finishing to read it.<br /><br />It is amazing how easy the writer drives the story and gets in to deep topics and conflicts of our daily life. That makes the book a great source of common sense and wisdom and makes easier to understand the reality.<br /><br />If you are a person interested into find out the source of many problems or conflicts this book can be very helpful.If you would like to expand your criteria for analysing different realities this book can be helpful.<br /><br />It is a bit too long but it is so easy to read... For sure I will read it more than once to find details I couldn't keep before.<br /><br />I'm even using the book for supporting my work like manager. It helps me to make evident some kind of problems and supports very good the process of finding solutions.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|this is my fathers favorite movie, and after seeing itmyself I can see why, a very well done, interesting western, big names, great story I would have to say \\"you need to see it, you will enjoy it\\"
B000K7VHPU|5.0|THE ILLUSIONIST is a really different kind of film:  it's a love story; a murder mystery and a game of magical mysteries.<br /><br />Set in turn of the century Vienna it follows the incomparable illusionist Eisenheim, who wins the devotion and support of his audiences, but infuriates the Crown Prince who demands to know Eisenheim's secrets.  Eisenheim also runs into his childhood sweetheart, Sophie, who is going to become engaged to the Crown Prince.  When Sophie decides to run away with Eisenheim, tragedy ensues and so does the many twists and turns of this marvelously filmed movie.<br /><br />Edward Norton as always shines in his role as Eisenheim, his quiet demeanor belying an uncanny knack for revenge; Paul Giamatti is perfect in his role as Chief Inspector Uhl, the Crown Prince's personal law enforcer who sees exposing Eisenheim as a way to advance his career; Jessica Biel radiates a soft beauty as Sophie; and Rufus Sewell chews up the screen villainously as the despicable Crown Prince.<br /><br />THE ILLUSIONIST is a very entertaining movie, and worth viewing.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|good - but of course could be better - conservative remix, but liked the selection and arrangements
B000005JA8|3.0|I've never known an album to polarize listeners the way \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" does. Literally, you'll either love it or hate it. I've known people who are at the forefront of experimental music who got physically ill when this album was merely mentioned, and I've known people who worshipped Styx and thought this album was great. Personally, I think about half the tracks could be eliminated and you'd end up with a better representation of this phase of Captain Beefheart's career, which was so outside the box that there was no box.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you have read the book you will love this DVD. Of course it is impossible to get everything in a book on DVD but this is a long DVD from A&E and there is plenty of time to get a lot of detail in along with little nuances that you the reader will be aware of as they occur. If you have not read the book you should...the DVD and book are very complimentary. I saw this in a store for $35 and almost bought it for my wife but the tightwad in me made me look on-line. Most places it is ballpark $35 but here on Amazon it was $19.99! The DVD is exactly what I  saw in the store...very classy and I am quite pleased with it. My wife loves it.
0930289528|5.0|The plot is brilliant, complex, thrilling and quick-paced. The tandem Moore-Lloyd has come up with wonderful ideas. Dialogues are great. Drawings/coloring are a bit dim for nowadays taste. Even if this book does not reach the perfection of some of Moore's later works, I found it really great. (Note: The movie based on the book does not faithfully render the complexity of the plot and has washed away many important details and subtleties. I found the movie was OK, but the book far much better.)
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This video is absolutely bursting with amazing talent.  You will thank yourself for purchasing this wonderful show. The range of musicians and instruments is great, also Yanni gives each musician and singer the spotlight on several occasions, it's truly a composition of great performers, not just a bunch of back up artists for a solo act.
1401207138|5.0|This \\"graphic novel\\" is outstanding for the intelligence, intensity and virtuosity of its elaborate plot, evidence (if need be) of Alan Moore's genius. Drawings are great. The insertion of the \\"story inside the story\\" (Tales of the black freighter) is brilliant. The edition is absolute-ly beautiful. When the last page was over, I felt like starting it all over again from the first page.
B000BFH2S2|4.0|Please understand that I normally enjoy MB and while I enjoyed this show; it was not the liveliest. He came off a little stiff and not that vibrant on stage. If all his live performance works are like this, stick with his CD's.
0307237699|4.0|Sen. Obama's latest book provides a hopeful vision in improving the American political system, as well as our society. Sen. Obama's cool and confident persona, along with pragmatism and honesty, should help all Americans think about politics in a different manner, regardless of what political ideology one has adapted. While debate is a key freedom that should be promoted in our democratic system, it has been altered by the addition of entertaining elements into television networks, which is the most common form of media and information in America. In his novel, Sen. Obama presents a core element of his idea of more civil politics, where there is consideration of other viewpoints, yet, presenting disagreements in a civil manner. Imagine the transformation of the media from Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity's slogan and flawed arguments to George Will, a conservative I may disagree with, but at the very least, respect his presentation and form of argument.  <br /> <br />Sen. Obama also presents some interesting proposals in his chapter entitled \\"Oppurtunity\\", where he offers ideas in the fields of education, business, and investments in lower income neighborhoods that ultimately serve the community better. Sen. Obama and I agree on many issues, including investments into education, innovative energy policies that will lead to energy independence, economic issues like balanced budgets and the preservation of the estate tax, to socioeconomic issues that affect families and communities. Though I may disagree with some of his positions here and there, I respect him for at least his thoughtful consideration.  <br /> <br />If Senator Obama decides to enter the 2008 Presidential race, I believe that his presence will help the country have a more open, honest, and thoughtful discussion of politics, instead of punditry and bumper-sticker phrases that are misleading and unproductive in public opinion. This book should help everyone, regardless of political ideology, think about the political process more intelligently.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A great series reminding the people of today what was done to provide us the freedom we take for granted today.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|A 90 minute trip across the country with almost no dialog, meeting a couple of women and not doing anything with them.  Finally getting to LA and another women who you think is the one he has been searching for, can't tell for sure since he never talks enough to let you know what he is thinking.  After 80 min. of traveling this movie is still rated G, not even any cursing since he never talks.  Suddenly this guy gets oral sex (graphic), from the LA chick no sex other than that.  Then he continues his journey in silence.  Will have to be the worst movie ever unless someone can explain this to me.  If he had shot himself out of despair the first ten min. of the movie then something would have made sense. Finally the nudity is a zero too.  he keeps his clothes on during the BJ and you see only the side of her boob.
B00005JP9V|5.0|I waited for this movie to come out. I had high expectations for it. These expectations were exceeded. I wanted to see greatness, I was surprised at the true greatness of this film. It is a must see, in the theatre...but make sure you dont spend $5.50 for a small popcorn.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|If you as a U2 fan or an aspiring one who \\"still haven't found what your looking for\\" this is a great addition. For the fan , this is a must have! For those toying with the idea that U2 maybe a great band (they are) this is a good sampler of their works.It really takes you through a journey of their career and their passion to make great music for the masses. I have grown up with the Edge and Bono and this CD really takes you through past an present. This is the \\"one\\" cd to have. If you \\"desire \\" to hear great music , this is for you. If you long for knowledge of this legendary band  , I highly suggest this cd along with the book U2 by U2 . It is was really written \\" in the name of love\\" . Love for this band and their love for music is truly captivated in this CD /DVD combo.Ireland's native son's \\"mysterious ways\\" are the \\"sweetest things\\" and sounds to my generation and those to come. Make it a \\"beautiful day \\" and buy it now. You'll be glad you did!
0395389496|5.0|One of the truly beautiful Christmas stories...and even better and simpler than its film counterpart.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Having been there when Beatlemania hit, and having followed every note since then from the Beatles and then individually, my hopes where as high as Lucy. In fact, I gave 25 copies as gifts to my colleagues over the Christmas season. <br /> <br />I love every note, every bit of the production done by long time \\"Beatle\\" George Martin and his son, and every transition and inter weave of songs. I have listened several times and will do so again today in my hobby room. <br /> <br />I am giving it only 4 stars instead of 5 though. I have heard \\"mixes\\" and \\"blends\\" of too many songs to think this is novel or unique. The quality is 1st rate and one can't go wrong with the material. My preference of all time Beatle music though is a toss up between the BBC recordings and the 3 part set that included studio outakes and variations. <br /> <br />With this said I do suggest a copy for the car and one for the home.
076790592X|5.0|great book, i like action but this book was calm and made me think about stuff for a long time..  i always recommend it to all my friends..
0060853964|5.0|OMG. If you love Neil Gaiman and you love Terry Pratchett, you'll love this book. I know, it seems obvious, but you'd think certain elements of each author's writing would figuratively step on the other's toes every so often. Pratchett's humor is entirely intact from page to page, but with a depth and insight that only Neil Gaiman could toss in. No squashed toes - instead, you get a lovely taste of them both smooshed together, somewhat like peanut butter and honey. A great read!!
6304712944|4.0|A movie that entertains and has a moral lesson to it,... unlike most of the junk we see today! <br />On parr with Goodbye Mr. Chips (Peter O`Toole) and My Fair Lady.

B000687M48|5.0|This is a quality recording of a very good live performance.  The bonus DVD is what pushes this to 5 stars.  The entire performance on video, a lengthy behind the scenes that is fun to watch and their music videos.  That is a lot of content for a single bonus disk!

0060931671|4.0|Written in the middle 1960's about Californians, this book entails a open-relationship couple, a husband who takes LSD prescribed by his wife's psychiatrist (who is institutionalized for his incurable paranoia), a wife whose first extra-marital affair evolves to her flop's departing for Vegas with a 15-year old groupie, and numerous deaths by people who have some affiliation with Tristero.<br /><br />And, between the beginning to the end, we know little about Tristero, just as little as protagonist Oedipa Maas, whose search for anything related to Tristero is the topic of this book.<br /><br />The jokes are belied in not-too-hard-to-decipher names of characters (Mike Fallopian, Mucho Maas, Stanley Koteks, Mike Di Presso . . .), places or things (Tristero, San Narcisso, Fangoso Lagoons) and companies (Yoyodyne, the Scope, radio station KCUF . . .).<br /><br />The writing is not as obvious.  Oedipa runs about attempting to decipher clues in her friend's will - something characterized as hieroglyphics in this novel on numerous occasions. The hieroglyphical messages appear to be more within the text - the reader is required to unveil or decipher the clues Pynchon delivers to the reader as the events in this book are laden with symbolism.<br /><br />This book can be read on many levels.  But, its true meaning was to be read at the level which would be best characterized as that of a university English class.  You can ignore the symbols, but that would defray from the jewels delivered throughout this novel.  Read it slowly. Read it thoroughly. And, if it occasionally hops over your head, reread that passage.  The details are worthy of your concentrated attention.
B000J103OI|4.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in long time. Meryl Streep should get an oscar for her performance.  Her english speaking assistant should get an award for Best Supporting Actress. Ann Hathaway was very good in the picture but her pace wore me out. <br />
0060888695|5.0|Harper Lee wrote an inspirational classic in \\"To Kill a Mockinbird\\". She breathed life into the moral struggle of those torn between the traditions of their culture and the quiet voice of conscience. It isn't an easy story and there is no conventional happy ending. It is therefore true to life but it is a book that gives hope. Its characters live and breathe in all their wonderful complexity and Sissy Spacek brings them from the page to our ears in a remarkable tour de force. Her soft southern accent takes us straight to the heart of the characters and she builds the atmosphere of the time beautifully. The art of story telling is not dead as long as Ms Spacek exercises her craft. My 16 year old son and I listened to her each morning on the 30 minute school run and could not wait to hear the next segment. This is well worth purchasing.
074356619X|5.0|I am Maurice's wife Annette and I can tell you that this book has changed the way we see everything. Everyone around the world should read this book...It has transformed our lives in ways that are remarkable and we feel happy all the time.

B000I0RR7Q|3.0|Maybe it's because of the detail in HD-DVD format, but I think Casablanca is a B-Movie at the most. The love story is not believable, Bogart is emotionless and delivers like he memorized the lines. Bergman does a credible job, except I don't buy her character being in love with Rick. Sure she had fun with him in Paris, but I didn't feel the love. That's the big deal about the movie, right? The effects were cheesy (maybe due to the High-Definition, they really show models as models) aircraft & buildings look like toys, the rear-projection car scenes are obviously not in a car. <br /> <br />I had never actually watched this movie all the way through before. I have always seen clips and parts, but not the whole movie in toto. With all the hype and buildup I really had expected a better movie. The HD-DVD is great, with marvelous quality and clear sound. But the movie itself was not all it's cracked up to be (imho). <br />
B000HBKCDC|5.0|The CD is wonderful.  I bought one for myself & one for a friend for Christmas.  I am very pleased with Amazon in general.  I used it for over half of my holiday purchases.  And then again for birthday presents after the first of the year.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|This movie kept me at the edge of my seat all through the movie.  Then towards the end of the movie I was happy to see the little girl found.  Only to find out the true ending.  Was not what I had thought would of happened.  But still could of happened.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|My all time favorite movie. I had about wore out the VHS tape of Sergeant York which I have had for several years and had hoped a DVD would be released.  I was so excited when I saw it being offered by Amazon.com and immediately put in my order.  As always Amazon.com came through with flying colors with the price and fast delivery time.  The story of Sergeant York is a great story of the American farmer who works hard, is honest and a strong believer in god.  Although at the beginning Alvin York was pretty much a hell raiser until \\"lightening struck\\", literally. He came to know god and stayed strong in his beliefs even during time of war.  This movie is about a World War I soldier who single-handedly captured 132 Germans during the battle of the Argonne, received the Congressional Medal of Honor (highest award for heroic action in combat) and the Distinguished Service Cross (2nd highest award for heroic action in combat).  Yet with all the medals, awards and recognition he received, he never attempted to cash in unlike some lesser people of today. He wasn't proud of what he did during war, he didn't believe in killing. Yet when the companies wanted to pay him huge sums of money for endorsements, he refused, because he realized it was because of his actions during the war. A wonderful feel good story and I would suggest if you don't know a lot about this American Hero, Alvin York, read some of the works about him which are sold on Amazon.com.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I went into this movie thinking I was going to hate it but boy was I wrong.  The illusionist is a love story mixed with mystery & fantasy leading to a very interesting movie.  The story is unique and the acting is great.  I am a huge fan of Ed Norton but I had low hopes for his performance in this movie.  He typically plays the jailbird tough guy but in the Illusionist he is a sensitive and highly intelligent bad boy type character.  The movie is dark but its not depressing or hard to follow.  Give this movie a try and I can almost guarantee you will love it.
0140143505|5.0|great short book (it can easily be read in an evening). the author has a voice that makes you fall in love with her. all book lovers should get this and spend a couple of hours of pure pleasure with this unique and spunky author. i look forward to reading it again somewhere down the road.
B0000B1OFN|4.0|Great action flick with entertaining story line. I bought the movie because of the fantastic driving scenes and special features with the Mini Coopers - and to accompany my wife's new Mini Cooper. Would highly recommend to both Mini and non Mimi auto owners. Just watched the \\"Original\\" version of The Italian Job (About 1969 with Michael Caine)last night and enjoyed the new \\"Mark Wahlberg in Los Angeles\\" version much more.  <br />
B0000047EC|5.0|reading & music go together like wine & cheese at my house. since most of my reading is done later in the evening, i am always looking for great music on the quieter side (the stooges, husker du, etc... will not do at midnight). this is one of my favorite late night recordings. I can't recommend it highly enough. Metheny's guitar & Haden's bass work up perfection on these melodies. Each track is a gem. Can't wait to give it yet another listen.
B000H305U0|3.0|Cute, Cute, Cute if you are 13.  After that its just too sweet.
B00000I8UF|5.0|who am i to say which is the best art blakey album. i'm just a silly mediocre person; but i will say this: this is great music. at the moment I will dare to say it is MY favorite blakey album. anyone who enjoys jazz should have this. and even if you have yet to get into jazz, pick up a copy of this anyway. great music is great music, regardless of genre.
B000002G6J|3.0|Was looking for that warm samba/bahia/bossa sound and what I got here was dangerously close to elevator music.  Maybe really high quality elevator music, but nevertheless.  This guy is acknowledged as a master, and I have no doubt he is, but this flavor is sooooo smooth that it feels more like lawrence welk.

B000050HTO|4.0|This is the most complete of all the Dylan recordings I have and that dates back to the 60's.
B000F3T7R4|4.0|Well, first i believe it's unfair for me to be the first album reviewer, but well...someone hast to start always.<br /><br />It always happens to me that with Whitesnake, the songs start good, become less good, then, go up again and the process repeats itself.<br /><br />That's because the order comes from the old LP Vinyl records, where side a and side b openers should be \\"Openers\\". That said, my favorites are actually those ones, with \\"Take me with you\\" in my opinion, the best.<br /><br />Now, my Review Title says complete your collection, that thinking you have all Coverdale's Whitensake records (and his solo projects, my guess), because i wouldn't chose this CD instead of another, say, for instance Ready and Willing or even Snakebite. It's good, sounds good, the remastered version sounds decent, but, i believe EMI forgot the meaning of \\"Bonus\\" tracks. Bonus, in my understanding, means something you have never heard before and now are available. The 4 songs you get, altough EXCELLENT, are already heard in previous Snakebite CD. No change, no variations, all the same. Period.<br /><br />And well, since i did not have the record, i bought it thinking in that priority, not in having a special CD with additional bonuses. If, on the other hand you like to read (which, is also my case) the booklets in search of storys of trouble, adventure and also good luck, then go ahead and buy it, since my guess is that the original trouble had only the awful explanation of what AAD, ADD and DDD meant (many years ago!).<br /><br />Anyway, rest of the tracks are ok, good ear with Belgian Tom's Hat Trick and Free Flight...<br /><br />Para los amigos de habla hispana, les resumo que el disco es bueno, pero en ning&uacute;n caso remplaza a cualquiera de la colecci&oacute;n. Est&aacute; lejos de sus predecedores y si quieren completar vuestra colecci&oacute;n, c&oacute;mprenlo, de lo contrario, elijan cualquier otro para empezar...<br /><br />Und wenn ihr deutsch spricht, kann euch sagen dass der Album eigentlich nicht schlecht ist, gar nicht wunderbar, aber wenn ihr's nicht hat, geh and kauft es, da es eigentlich wertvoll ist, es zu haben :)<br /><br />Take Care...r nicht wunderbar, aber wenn ihr's nicht hat, geh and kauft es, da es eigentlich wertvoll ist, es zu haben :) <br /> <br />Take Care...
0618680004|5.0|I understand why this book has been such a best seller!  It's not just for atheists--it works even better for those who believe in God but hate to see the results of abuse, hate mongering, and fraud heaped upon trusting and faithful believers by those who use their pulpit for personal gain and to punish those who believe differently.  Dawkin's points out so brilliantly how various people have pushed personal religious tenets to the extreme--and hurt otherwise kind and caring people. <br />Read in the light of knowing more about religious abuse I found this book driving me to get to the next chapter.  It makes one a better person to have reviewed Dawkin's ideas and observations--its a wakeup call to those who see our administration using religion to push political goals. <br />And it reads fast, even though many examples are British and not American. <br />
0679809015|5.0|My son is 17 months old and he loves this book!  He loves to look at it everyday and enjoys opening the barn doors and gates to find the animals. <br />It's a very small book and I wish it were a little bigger, but I am really glad we made the purchase!

B00003CXCW|5.0|Had Billy Wilder directed no other film but SUNSET BLVD, he would still rank in the forefront of Hollywood directors. In the history of Hollywood film production, perhaps no film about film has captured so much about the industry in such fine fashion.<br /><br />Although made in that now long ago landmark year of 1950 (ALL ABOUT EVE also premiered that year), SUNSET still speaks to today. While the movie is about what happens to a great star of yesteryear who refuses to wake up and admit the parade has passed her by, the movie is not just about fading film stars. It is about anyone who has had a successful career in ANY field and who refuses to stop living in the past.<br /><br />The cast is letter-perfect. As archetypal has-been movie queen Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson plays the part to a fare-thee-well. By turns creepy, pathetic and brilliant, she makes us care about her, in spite of her autocratic behavior. William Holden is dead-on as failed screenwriter Joe Gillis. We understand his desperation while also cringing at how easily he becomes entangled in the spider web of Norma's neediness. The story is timeless and makes one wonder just how many former stars, still living in Hollywood, are playing out real-life variations of this brilliant screenplay. The \\"look\\" of the movie, especially the interior of Norma's Sunset Boulevard mansion, is practically a character itself. Its ambience as an aging, crumbling shrine to Norma's glory days ensnares and fascinates us the same way Norma does Joe. Cecil B. DeMille and Hedda Hopper playing themselves; and has-been (and Hollywood great) Buster Keaton essentially playing himself as one of Norma's bridge-playing cronies are bonuses in a film that is truly not to be missed. Forget most of the dreck now appearing at your local cineplex and rent this DVD---or better, buy it. It holds up to many, many repeat viewings.
B000JU7NCE|4.0|I've seen better concert footage but if you want to hear the Cure with Porl Thompson on guitar again, here is an excellent selection of songs to see & hear a 4 piece Cure band.  The price is right for what has been released and the band looks like they are enjoying themselves again.
B000002P74|5.0|I believe this is the best album (sorry, cd) Skynyrd ever put out.  Every song is good, no sleepers. Saw them in a movie theatre in NY in '75, Kansas opened for them. Awe the good ole' days, at least what you can remember.
0618680004|5.0|the author, Carl Zimmerling may not be well known but many of his own experiences during many years of overseas travel, deep knowledge of basic scientices as well as his personal critic about the negative influence of religion are important and a must read for everybody. His chapter on the relationship of all life with humans is usually ignored by the faithful believers: They feed the same, breed the same, bleed the same.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is a great series that originaly played on the SiFi Channel. Its from the creators of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel so its has the same drama feel but a touch of comady. The charecters are enjoyable and the stories are well put togther the show seems to get better as the season rolls along. If you enjoy the series they also made a movie called Serenity the bad news is they cancelled the series after only 1 season so try not to get too attached to the charecters. Overall it is very enjoyable.
B00005JO20|5.0|If you liked the original, then this movie is on par. It is way too long though, at 3.5+ hours you can become quite restless once they leave the Island. I personally love the movie because they took the original and improved upon it in every mannor possible. Plus, with today's graphical abilities it is a spectacular looking film. A movie buff must!

B00009XITP|3.0|This story is about a teenager named Daphne who is living with her mom in America. Her mom married Henry Dashwood rather young, but when his family found out, she was told he wanted a divorce and he was told that she ran off to America with some guy, but unknown to him she was pregnant with Daphne. She has never seen her Dad, but she knows he lives in London. Every time she and her mom cater at weddings, she hears the father/daughter dance, and wishes she had a Dad she could dance with. So, she leaves a note for her mom and boards a plane for London hoping to find her Dad, with only his name in her pocket. When she arrives at a hotel a guy named Ian befriends her. She looks at the television in the hotel lobby and notices that her Dad is being interviewed on television because he is running for Prime Minister. She looks over at Ian and says,\\"that's my Dad.\\" It' s a little hard to get up the nerve to barge into her Dad's life when he doesn't know she exists, especially when she finds out he lives in a mansion with a guarded gate. She decides instead of entering the conventional way, the front door, to climb the wall, and runs into the house unannounced. Of course her Dad takes her for a reporter, and she is cornered in a chair and lectured. Finally she bursts out and says, \\"this isn't how I imagined my first meeting with my Dad.\\"<br /><br />Now this might very well sound like a harmless and fun story, but I was disappointed in this movie. I expected more character development in the main character. The main character didn't have very good lines. It portrayed her more as a typical American teenager in immodest clothing and she didn't show much restraint in her public behavior. A lot of her scenes showed her dancing in revealing outfits. Colin Firth's acting though was superb. He had some really good lines, and you got to know his character the best. I thought the message that family is more important than worldly success was good,as well as showing that close father/daughter relationships are important, but I was disappointed that it overly emphasized that you should be yourself, whether good character or not. The love story was immature and selfish. The young man did not encourage her in her relationship with her father, but wanted her to himself. All in all I think it was better than average, but communicates some very wrong values for young people. So remember that you were forewarned if you decide to watch it.er relationships are important, but I was disappointed that it overly emphasized that you should be yourself, whether good character or not.

B000301YY8|1.0|It is a hard world for gentle people. Everywhere there are bright colors, sharp edges and cacophonous noises. There are lost loves, bloody wars and clouded futures. On his debut album, James Blunt chronicles his experience as such a person with ten cuts of pencil-necked drudgery certain to stimulate sensitive lacrimal glands worldwide. <br /> <br />Manipulative and cloying, his melodies are little more than single-chord noodlings barely pinched through James's tiny throat. Languid acoustic guitars and sparse keys and percussion construct false auras of desperation and sincerity. James often likes to \\"jam\\" on one or two notes, seemingly improvising rhythms and melodies from the simplest musical figures imaginable, creating infuriating weenie-pop skat.  <br /> <br />One need only hear samples of Mr. Blunt's arrangements to infer the nature of his lyrics, self-absorbed tales chronicling the horrors of, well, not finding a soul-mate in every single attractive woman on the subway. Lyrics range from brutal stupidity to pretentious ambiguity and back again, save the occasional turn of ham-fisted social criticism. Worst is \\"Goodbye My Lover,\\" a sanguine, undisciplined ballad apparently stolen unedited from a teenage journal entry. Blunt inspires pity not because he taps the listener's emotions, but because we are sorry that a man so pathetic must exist. <br /> <br />This deplorable release paints Mr. Blunt as artistically misguided and emotionally wretched.

B000J4OYRW|5.0|What a great DVD.  I'm not getting caught up in the videos that are or are not in the bonus material.  This was a great show for a fan, and really shows the breadth of the PSB as artists, what they have accomplished, where they may have stumbled, and how inspirational they have been to so many.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's 3 hours of enjoyment.

B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is one of the more important movies of the last 10 years.  Its story is compelling and it is exciting to watch.  Combine that with groundbreaking cinematography and the merging of different movie genres in a novel way, and you have the movie equivalent of the novel \\"Neuromancer\\" by William Gibson.  Both of these shifted their respective worlds.

B0000047CX|5.0|Hopefully this will not be interpreted as a flagrant advertisement.  I am not affiliated with the below mentioned artist in any way.  BUT... <br /> <br />If you are anything like me and have loved this Getz/Gilberto album (for me it was far and away my favorite Brazilian music), you really MUST hear a much more recent artist by the name of Marcio Faraco.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  He has three CD's you will find on Amazon and I have brief reviews of each.  His style is very reminiscent of Gilberto and the recording quality excellent.

B00004YZFR|3.0|The Maysles' brothers had film rolling in 1969 on the Rolling Stones' American tour and we are left with a little snapshot of time, a window to the groaning disillusioned close to the hippie counterculture.<br /><br />I had high hopes with \\"The Rolling Stones--Gimme Shelter,\\" as most reviewers touted it as one of the greatest statements on Rock and Roll and certainly one of the best music films around.  After watching it, I'm not sure that I'd agree.  If you are a Stones'-Head, I can certainly see the allure.  I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan myself and I admit a similarly subjected documentary made about that band would leave me pulling out my wallet dialing up Amazon and making an advance purchase.  So if you fall into the category of ascribing to Mick, Keith, and the boys rock and roll demagogy, well, you probably are convinced that \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" is the greatest thing since sliced toast.  The movie is fragmented.  At the beginning we get this ringside seat of the Stones' tour, music-making, and dare I say, boring goings-on.  Yes, the Rolling Stones, one of the 60's, 70's, and 80's more storied wild rock n roll band...boring.  This documentary actually captures the band as such until Altamont that is.  At Altamont the documentary takes a turn and things get interesting.<br /><br />Wherever you are with the 60's counterculture free-love, free-spirit debate as to the value of its role on our cultural development, this documentary seems to come across tangentially as a statement on all that.  The boomers, the generation, that fervently stood up for world peace, free-love, communal living, getting together had some wonderful idealistic ideas.  So, famous boomers, the generation that produced both Bill Clinton and George Bush, Jr., also include Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...not to mention dear Charlie Watts.  Altamont though sees the counterculture exposed.  The bookend of the big festivals, Woodstock and Altamont are pretty diametrically opposed.  One worked and one tragically didn't.<br /><br />What we get from \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" is a statement that along with an idealistic approach to life needs to accompany a healthy dose of responsibility, accountability, and the need for organization.  You can't say you have general good-will towards humanity without taking responsible action to ensure that the human condition exists in a safe semi-ordered world.  That is reading entirely too much into \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" I know but as the concert organizers go through the parking plan of trying to accommodate tens of thousands of cars in space that won't accommodate all those cars, we get a window on an enlightened and funny scene.  One of the concert organizers at the event is trying to help with the parking situation and eventually just says...yeah man we are letting them park wherever, it's kind of like an experiment.  Hah...an experiment which leads into a far more serious 'experiment' the California Hell's Angels being in charge of security.<br /><br />The stage becomes unsafe as people press in from all sides on The Burrito Brothers, Jefferson Airplane, and the Stones.  Jefferson Airplane's lead singer even gets beat up by the Hells Angels, yeah that's right, the guys hired to protect them.  The Grateful Dead refuses to go on (smart guy that Jerry Garcia) and we eventually get to the chaos that kills a man, Meredith Hunter.  Mick tries to take some responsibility and attempts to lead the crowd and the Angels in a \\"let's get together,\\" plea reminiscent of Rodney King's \\"can't we all just get along.\\"  So we see the band's reaction to reviewing the concert footage and can actually see the Hell's Angels' knife-welding member slashing down on Hunter and Jagger walks away numb.  Incredulously music is played after the incident and the show goes on.  There has been no solution really to the masses going haywire at Rock-N-Roll concerts...from the Who's stampede to PJ's Roskilde...safety and security in the midst of celebrations and in the midst ofrock-n-roll rebellion is still an issue to be addressed.<br /><br />So on this MLK day 2007, there is nothing wrong with the concepts behind loving your fellow man, world peace, and all that 60's stuff.  MLK stood up for it and stood up for it with responsibility and accountability.  Altamont didn't have that.  Culturally, where are we going now in this time of GWOT and Brittney Spears?  The show must go on and the Stones still geriatrically rock.  The best rock-umentary of all times...Gimme Shelter...in my opinion probably not.  Check out \\"Dig,\\" for a really excellent updated statement on rock and roll.  If you are a fan of the Stones or just a fan of music history, watch Gimme Shelter.  If not I don't think you will get no satisfaction.<br />--MMWn issue to be addressed.

0743289412|2.0|This book was terrible.  I have read every Stephen King book and short story out there, and have enjoyed most of them, but it was really hard getting through this one.  The story was initially very difficult to follow, jumped around irritatingly, and never got going.  I always finish what I start, so I felt obligated to finish the book, but it was the biggest waste of time since The Historian. <br /> <br />The characters are irritating and don't react to situations appropriately.  Their responses to danger often border on the ridiculous. <br /> <br />My advice is not to even think about reading this garbage. <br />

0618680004|1.0|Christianity was a realigning of Judaism after the Jews went astray. The Christians then went astray after the Europeans took hold of the direction. The Muslims were doing ok until the Europeans affected them in th 12th century by telling them how scientists were taking people away from GOD, then the Muslims went astray. The Europeans then seperated from their religion and proceeded to succeed in the sciences that religion had held it back from. GOD never meant the religions to become controlled by these religous structures that exist today in all religions (major and minor). In it's truest form religion is a vehichle to achieve freedom, in the form presented by Rabbi's , priests and mullahs it is oppression. GOD has always encouraged the advancement for man, it is man that holds man back in the name of GOD. Rise above the lies of religious history books but NEVER think that 3-D universe mapping, wireless technologies, fighter planes, nuclear technologies or any other man made technologies can ever replace GOD and the rights given to man to hold onto for the good of mankind.
B00000JTB2|5.0|I have been dedicated to electric blues guitar music for over twenty years now, and I spend at least 25% of all my free time, investigating and searching for electric blues music. I can say uncategorically, that this is the greatest electric blues album ever made!! It is the King and Prince of blues live. Some people play the guitar and touch the strings. Albert and Stevie \\"bend\\" the strings! As great as the music and singing is, the live \\"banter\\" between the two should be in the blues hall of fame. If you really know the history of the electric blues, you'd know that, Albert was, to put it mildly, cantankerous to work with. He once threw his drummer off the stage in the middle of a concert for messing up notes. But, Stevie, showed so much respect, and reverence to his idol, that Albert, had a ball, during the recording, and told him how glad he was that Stevie came to play with him. After listening to this CD, you will find it hard to find anything that comes close to it. With all my heart, I guarantee, that any person, who really likes electric blues guitar, will love this album, like no other. If I were allowed to put my phone# or EMAIL address in this review, I would have every one of you, who read this, and listened to me, and bought this CD, and was happy with it call me, and I'd never be lonely again!!!

B00005JL0I|4.0|Casino Royale is an irreverent spoof, a cynical gaze, a satiric blink, a psychedelic entry of those sixties, where the fever of the great spies and the demons inner and outer nestled everywhere. Not only James, James bond, but a true sequel of minor personages loaded the screen and TV. I'm spy, The man from UNCLE, The green hornet were some of the most distinguished TV series in those ages. The ideological conflict between East and West, the employment of the black humor and double sense jokes, make this film directed by five directors John Huston, Robert Parrish, Ken Hughes,  Joe Mc Grath,  and Val Guest , and supported by an international cast that gathered the genius of Orson Welles (who previously had collaborated with Huston on Moby Dick)  with authentic stars such as William Holden, Charles Boyer, the sensual Ursula Andress, a very young promise named Woody Allen will ignite the screen with admirable vignettes that demand from the viewer to be aware about the world in those ages. If you don't, maybe some funny sequences along the movie lack of sense for you.<br /><br />An anthological cult movie!

Made with honesty, commitment and conviction. Since its immediate release, an absolute classic in the popular genre.
0783114893|2.0|The two-star review is for the transfer. While the movie itself is pretty good, the transfer for this DVD is awful. It looks like they burned copies from an old VHS tape (that happened to be in widescreen) and turned around and sold it to the public for consumption. Sorry I bought it.

B000JLTRIG|5.0|The best thing about Charmed was that it was pure entertainment involving both drama and comedy, with the balance between the two depending on the theme of each individual episode. It wasn't supposed to show Wicca in a good light or a bad light or even a remotely correct light - it was just a clever metaphor for the relationship between the sisters, which was the real point of the series. It was supposed to be sappy and corny at times. It was supposed to be like a soap opera. I never loved Rose McGowan as Paige, but, to be truthful, I never liked Shannon Dougherty as Prue that much either. I always enjoyed watching until Billie joined in the last season. How could it be that a witch, not related to the Charmed Ones, is more powerful than they? If so, why were they even called the Charmed Ones in the first place? That is why this seventh season should have been the final one. I thought that the plots in season eight were at times more powerful and clever than season seven, but Billie's antics just got in the way of enjoying it. Plus, the season seven finale did such a good job of wrapping everything up it just seemed like an appropriate place to end the series.<br /><br />Season seven is definitely much better than season six. It seemed like Charmed drifted for a season and a half after Cole's death in the middle of season five since the show had so much invested in that storyline, but here they are back on track. Being an \\"Angel\\" fan, I particularly liked Charisma Carpenter's guest appearances, even if she does come across like the Buffy-era Cordelia except with magical powers. I also liked \\"Cheaper by the Coven\\" where the sisters revert to their teenage personas and Wyatt creates a demon in the image of his dad because he feels like it is his fault that Leo isn't around and Gideon is dead. It shows just how much the parents' relationship affects their children, and also how much parents dont realize that their interactions with each other affect their children. This episode sees Piper and Leo putting aside their differences to help their son, and it was really great to see that again. Overall, highly recommended.de sees Piper and Leo putting aside their differences to help their son, and it was really great to see that again. Overall, highly recommended.

B00005JO9J|5.0|These two DVD's were just great!  I didn't start watching Grey's Anatomy until their second season, so watching the whole first season was such a treat.  The cast of this program is fabulous, each and everyone having their own ax to grind and their own personalities and challenges.  Each is unique.  You mix all this with the story lines of each patient and their process from admission to either checking out and going home or dying and it's interesting and sometimes captivating.  I couldn't be more pleased.

B0000TG9E2|5.0|Most films age over time. In 20 years will Titanic still be as amazing as it was in 1998? Will Jurassic Park still have people gawping open mouthed at the cinema screen? I think not. Its a rarity, but sometimes, just sometimes, there comes a movie that is timeless, magical and eternal, one such film is Alice in Wonderland. <br /> <br />It seems to me, when watching most Disney films, that Walt Disney had an evil masterplan to mess with the minds of children, young and old. Dumbo is a film about an outsider, Pinocchio is a film about a freak child who cannot stop lying. Walt only made these films family viewing through constantly having a moral ending. Dumbo can fly and Pinocchio is rewarded for risking his life to save another, however, these moral endings do not disguise the fact that, at times, Disney films were quite peculiar. <br /> <br />Alice in Wonderland on the surface is a dreamlike fantasy about a child nodding off and visiting a wonderful wonderland where flowers sing, caterpillars smoke and rabbits talk. However, this film is not about the surface values, its is about the dark, seedy undertones that exist beneath the aesthetic surface. <br /> <br />Below its surface lies a wealth of wholly unlikeable and unhelpful creatures. Aside from the King of Hearts, each character only serves to hinder Alice in her attempts to come to terms with her warped dream. The Cheshire Cat is responsible for putting Alice in court, the White Rabbit wants to have Alice destroyed when he finds her at his home, the flowers shun Alice when they incorrectly perceive her to be a common garden weed, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare also shun Alice for no reason whatsoever, this list is as long as the tunnel that leads Alice into her Wonderland. <br /> <br />To look back at the film nowadays, one could surmount that the ending is nothing more than a cop-out. She dreamt it all along is nothing more than saying, here, we'll give you licence to create a magical world, no boundaries because it all exists inside a young girls mind. <br /> <br />It is for these warped reasons and the context of what the film represents or least what it should represent that I absolutely adore it. Walt Disney might have had a masterplan to screw with the minds of his children, but I say, good luck to him. <br /> <br />Sleep is only a state of mind, it's what happens in this state of mind that really matters. Or at least, what mattered to Walt. <br /> <br /> <br />For material that does not lend itself very easily to cinema, this is a pretty good adaptation of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" with some enjoyable characters and sequences. It succeeds, at least in a basic way, in capturing part of the manic but imaginative nature of Lewis Carroll's story. <br /> <br />Much of the language, poetry, and ideas that make the original story so captivating cannot really be conveyed very easily in a movie, and so it would be nearly impossible for any cinema version of Alice to be completely satisfying to those who love the book. Instead, this version simply tries to make the characters come to life, and to use the animation to recreate the feel, if not the depth, of Alice's experience. <br /> <br />The animation drives most of the movie, and at times it is pretty imaginative. Some of the voices work very well, too, with the likes of Ed Wynn and Sterling Holloway fitting the animated characters quite well. <br /> <br />Carroll's stories are so enchanting and creative that it is no surprise that there have been so many efforts through the years to capture the magic of the Alice stories on film. None of the cinema versions has yet come close to matching the books, yet the material itself has made most of them worth watching. In this one, the overall production has a definite Disney style to it, which makes it different from the original, but as a movie it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> <br />The Masterpiece Edition (playable only for NTSC or Multi-Region DVD Players, unfortunately) has some terrific extras, and this version is definitely the most complete Alice in Wonderland experience.  <br /> <br />Classic.
B000002MU3|5.0|Granted, many REM fans adhere to the notion that only 80's REM is good REM.  To be clear, REM was arguably the BEST band of the 80's.  But Monster was ambitious.  It sounded loud, raucous, and was fun.  The early 90's were about having heavy power chords dominate.  REM merely explored and did it better than most.  In my hear of hearts, REM will always be \\"Fall on Me\\" REM but I'll blast \\"What's the Frequency Kenneth with as much aplomb.

1932100660|5.0|This in-depth study (more like studies) reveals what more people are discovering every day - the ticket to a healthier and a longer life lies with the individual. Everyone is directly responsible for his/her own nutrition or lack thereof.<br /><br />This book does not talk down to the average person, nor does it speak in the sometimes lofty way that scientists and doctors have of speaking (as if they are talking to another scientist or doctor). This is a profound book written in a simple, quite comprehensible manner.<br /><br />Please, do yourself and your family, friends, co-workers and community a favor -- get this book, read it (more than once until it truly penetrates) and get a copy for someone else (or lend your copy). Whatever you do, for your own good, don't sleep on this!<br /><br />I feel it necessary to add that even though much of this book is helping me to gain healthy eating habits, I do not (and probably never will) become a strict vegan. I do not believe in extremes but rather in moderation. Too much of anything is usually bad for you.<br /><br />Just use common sense. Eat a mostly plant-based, WHOLE-foods-based nutrition plan. Most supplements go in one end and out the other without being digested or if digested do not do in isolation what they would in their natural, complex form. Animal-based food is not bad; just eat it in small portions compared to the plant food.<br /><br />And remember that one food plan does not suit everybody. Each body is unique. Learn what works best for yours!<br /><br />P.S. It doesn't hurt to learn how to skillfully and creatively use herbs and spices to make plant food taste absolutely delicious! I speak from experience.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|George Martin & son have done a great job in remixing these songs into one fantastic c.d.! A worthwhile purchase for any Beatles fan, especially those who also enjoyed the 'Anthology' series.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|My only regret about this movie is that more people haven't seen it. It's fairly faithful to the novel, it offers lush cinematography, and just about every performance is remarkable. My favorite is the ever-brilliant Sophie Thompson as Ann's whiny hypochondriac younger sister. It's possible that people who haven't read Austen's contemplation on the fate of aristocrats without money and a spinster of 27 won't love the movie as much as I do. But of course every literate person who appreciates social commentary entwined with romantic comedy should read the book, one of Austen's brightest gems. So read and watch. Can't think of a better use of your time.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan this is a wonderful gift. The some 30 remixed songs couldn't sound any better and if you are lucky enough to see the great Las Vegas show the CD is based on you are really in for a treat.
B000ESST6U|5.0|I have 100+ opera dvds and this is probably THE best one, for all around singing, acting, costumes, sets, and pure entertainment.  Yes, it makes an excellent audio recording to enjoy over and over, but you will also find yourself watching it over and over too, because it is such a good show.    Connolly pulls off Cesare as well or better than any man ever did.  Her coloratura is very pleasing and the voice well-balanced.  The Cleopatra sings beautifully, is gorgeous to look at, and is quite a dancer as well.  The Tolomeo is also quite light on his feet - he even does a complete flip during one scene.  It's like he's a singer-slash-gymnast.  He has a noticeable break to the voice but seems to use it almost as an advantage rather than a negative.    The singer of Sesto seems a wee bit uncomfortable with this music occasionally.  She has a fairly noticeable break to the voice on the fast bits, but her 'Cara Speme' is to die for - the audience seemed to appreciate it too.  Also the Achilla was occasionally a bit blustery and off the mark on the coloratura, but not entirely sloppy.  For the most part, he was quite acceptable.  The direction was fantastic.  I finally found an opera dvd where it appears that the director actually knew more about the opera than I did!  How refreshing.  For instance, he has the singers do some simple little dance-steps during 'Va tacito...' where it really emphasizes how Cesare and Tolomeo are squaring off for a big conflict.  And yet no singer seemed to be doing anything they were not comfortable with.    It is set in colonial Egypt under English rule, around the turn of the twentieth century.  In my mind, this setting is a great historical witticism.  Great choice.    There is plenty of humor in the direction, but rarely poor taste.  Finally, they are figuring out how to present Handel operas with both taste and entertainment-value!    This is a wonderful video - just buy it.
1594200823|5.0|I think everyone wanting to empower themselves by understanding what it is they're eatting should read this book.. It has been very inspirational and influential to many people I know, it was recommended through my wifes farming class at WSU. Another book I'd suggest is Fast Food Nation.
B000005HLV|2.0|Supposedly this is Mayhem's best album.  At least that's what one guy told me.  Anyway, I really like the singer's weird voice.  It sounds very evil.  Most of the music is incredibly amateurish.  It sounds like it took incredibly little skill to have created.  The music lacks much complexity.  The drums are about 85% blast beats.  I gave it greater than 1 star because I really like the singer and a few seconds here and there sound good.  I also really like the cover art and the images of the band members in the sleeve.

B000000H40|5.0|This album is a classic.  All of the songs are very good and memorable.  The continuation between the songs is slightly different than most albums.  There is some funky noise between songs like moaning, wind, growling, or similar noises.  On this album, Obituary also covered Celtic Frost's Circle of the Tyrants.
B000H30B3G|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my son. Product came in timely manner and in good condition. My son is thrilled with this DVD set.
0385473788|5.0|This diary is a unique experience.  Powerful and moving, Anne's day by day entries bring one so very close to her and the war which enveloped her, her family and the others secreted away in the back of a warehouse.<br /><br />While it should be required reading for young teens, it's really for everyone.  The definitive edition added some entries and detail that are missing in earlier versions, but is it worth it if you already have any copy ?  That's hard to say.<br /><br />What I will suggest is to get this version if you do not own a copy and learn about the heights and depths of humanity:  Anne's hopes ( and fears ) and the omnipresent cloud of Nazism that surrounded their every day .<br /><br />I plan to re-read it from time to time , which is why I chose to own a copy rather than borrow one.  She is one of those people I would choose to want to meet in the afterlife.  Her diary belies great insight and tenderness.  I cannot imagine anyone reading it and not being touched by<br /><br />her all too short life.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this series, that I didn't want to do anything but watch the show all the way through.  Veronica Mars is just the right amount of seriousness and edge.  Lots of fun thrown in as well.  She handles herself like a pro and it is very entertaining.  I will buy the third season when it comes out.I was a little disapointed that there were no subtitles for season two like there was in season one.  If you like mystery buy this series.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|We had a Doors weekend of music and video, very cool stuff. I wish there was more visuals to accompany the music playback from the DVDs. <br /> <br />
B00005JO9J|5.0|i would advice this serie to anyone who likes a bit of drama and dificult relationships, and wants to re-live all those simple things we go through in life without thinking about them and taking them for granted; untill things blow up in our faces... it's only then that we start to think... <br />you know they are acting, but sometimes it's as real as it can get. enjoy !!!
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Illmatic is a classic that should be in everyone's collection.  It's in my opinion one of the best hip hop albums out there.  The vibe is very similar to A Tribe Called Quests's Low End Theory, using clean samples from old jazz and blues tracks.  A definite keeper.
0060776757|5.0|We got this book by shock!  We saw it and bought it on the spot over a month ago after reading the inside cover flap on how it was created (see writeup above).  I haven't \\"put it down\\" yet!<br /><br />As a once-professional (classical) musician and as a fan of U2 (and many other rock bands as well) this book is entirely absorbing.<br /><br />Not only does every single page give either visual or \\"spoken\\" new glimpses into a group of very private people (despite the \\"public\\" Bono, he is pretty private!), it also gives a musician or rock band fan an intimate and to me, enthralling, look into how this band makes music, both in the studio and on the stage.  (\\"Like building a house from the roof down\\" is the way Edge puts it - and it sounds like it in the stories!)<br /><br />This band is not only an absorbing group to listen to (and watch), it is also made up of four very unique and, after reading this book, to me very endearing individuals who, as Larry says, \\"are one but ... are not the same\\".<br /><br />The book gives insight into the group's incredible commitment, heart, loyalty (the \\"author\\" knew them all before they were a band - he attended the same school; the graphics design is by the same fellow who made their first \\"U2\\" posters and buttons!) and drive that I find to be unique in any realm of today's world.<br /><br />From the early days before and after they first \\"met\\" to form a band to the \\"Vertigo\\" tour while it was still in progress, this book is an incredible journey I would never wanted to have missed.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough to any music fan.<br /><br />For U2 fans it is a MUST HAVE!
1582701709|5.0|I could not wait to get it in the mail as I had seen it at a conference. I wanted to share it with my business builders in my business. However the book came to me direct from Amazon within 4 days... but it took over three weeks for the DVD to get to me as Amazon did not have it and it was out sourced to another company to send it out.... trying to get in contact with this other company to get my product was not easy... and I was very upset at the service I got giving that part of my service 0 stars...
B00005MP58|5.0|Can I just say that I love Colin Firth?  Anyway. . . this is a really great rendition of the Jane Austin Novel Pride and Prejudice.  They stray a little from the original story, but keep pretty true to the intent.  I very much enjoyed spending the time to watch this and even enjoyed the commentaries and interviews.  If you are a Colin Firth fan, you will love this movie.
0316286850|5.0|I first saw these books when I was going to Elite Cosmetology School. I have since hoped to further my career with makeup and remembered the tips and advice in his books. I have since purchased \\"Face Forward\\". I would recommend to anyone. Even though a lot of the tips are very basic. the pictures and personal stories are what really drew me in to these books. Kevyn was an amazing artist.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|EVERYONE should be forced to watch this movie.  If we make some simple changes to our lifestyle we CAN make a difference in our children's lives.  The film shows that Global Warming is already causing numerous natural disasters that are killing thousands.  From 122 degree weather to Katrina, etc.  Gore goes on to explain how these disasters happen.  Why they are happening.  He does a great job showing this so that it is easy to understand the cause and effect.  He gives us a glimps into why the government doesn't do more about it.  What is REALLY FRIGHTENING is what scientists believe our Earth will be like in as little as 50 YEARS.  Not 100 years!  FIFTY YEARS!  Our children and their children will be living a life here on Earth that we couldn't imagine.  WE have to make some easy changes to our lifestyle now to make a better future for our children...To make Earth livable for our children.  Don't be one of those people who think... \\"What difference can I make?  I am only one person.\\"  You can spread the word and tell people about this documentary.  You can make some simple changes to you lifestyle.  You can make a difference!  Our children depend on it.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I liked a lot of the songs but I don't think they were as great as the Fever CD.  I really liked \\"Save the Last Dance\\" and \\"A foggy day in london town\\".
B000J103OI|5.0|I really love this dvd and it was a good decision to buy it. Very nice story and great stars make this movie to one of the best. Pleasure to see it over and over again. And by the way, the girl looks very sexy when she is wearing all those different clothing! Wow!
B000002QWD|5.0|I listened to a lot of the songs during Christmas time.  When I finally bought the product I was suprised and very happy at how great the songs still were.  My favorite is \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" with the Andrew Sisters.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This is the best Il Divo album to date.  The songs are great and the singing and production is top notch.  Mostly Spanish language songs. Highly recommended for Il Divo lovers!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|My husband bought this for me for my birthday and I was spellbound. I cannot improve upon the review of \\"prisrob,\\" but I will warn anyone watching this that some names got switched around from the family of Emperor Franz Josef. In real life, there was a Crown Prince Rudolf who was the only son of Franz Josef, but in the movie the crown prince is called Leopold. Leopold was a royal  name but he wouldn't come around for a while. (The real Crown Prince Rudolf had a fascination with guns and would eventually kill himself and his mistress. The personality portrayed is very believable for anyone who knows much about this family.) There was all the excitement of Austria from the turn of the century, the costuming, while not over the top, is impressive. The horses are beautiful. The scenery a delight. Watch the movie to enjoy it, but remember that there is much to be learned in the portrayal of life in the period, you will not learn anything about the actual royal family of Austria.<br /><br />Sit back, enjoy, but do not analyze. My only problem during the first viewing was that I was bugging everyone in my house with, \\"Wait-- the crown price was going to marry Stephanie-- did they say her name is Sophie? I thought his name was Rudolf, not Leopold. Wasn't Leopold later?\\" Don't do that. It's a story loosely based around a period of time with certain names but it's not close to being biographical.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|I'm a huge fan and purchased this because it's a collectors item and I was willing to pay the price. As stated in a previous review, if you have a region free DVD player (or a DVD-ROM drive in your computer), playback of the imported PAL set is not an issue. After researching, I was able to find Volkerball for $118 (US) plus shipping. After getting it in my hands and taking a look at this edition, I started thinking about the cost. The cost of the average newly released 2 CD set is approximately $25 to $30. The cost of the average newly released 2 DVD set is approximately $30 to $40 dollars. So separately you'd be looking at $55 to $70 just for those items. Add to that a 200 page collectors edition hard bound glossy photo book, and in my opinion, the asking price is not that outrageous. For those that want the music for a lower price, there are also Standard (1 CD / 1 DVD) and Limted (1 CD / 2 DVD) edition sets available for purchase. <br /> <br />All that being said, the concert footage is outrageously intense and I loved every minute of it. The making of Reise, Reise documentary was interesting as was Anaconda in the Net. I've been listening to the CD's for about a week now and plan on listening to them quite a bit more.
B00004XQ83|4.0|the music of this album is extremely attractive with a well-balanced variety of melodies and lyrics.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I was afraid the story would seem dated.  It holds up well. <br /> <br />Baryshnikov's dancing is amazing.  Worth the money ++
B000EDWKXI|5.0|Here is a lighthearted and romantic tale of the famous (infamous?) playboy Casanova.  The sets of the Venice of a couple hundred years ago are truly wonderful.  People who enjoy period films are sure to like this one.<br /><br />Heath Ledger does a surprisingly wonderful job of portraying the legendary seducer of women.  In many ways, the whole concept of Casanova is like an inflated male fantasy.  It asks:  \\"What if?\\" it were the case that women were to chase after us like we chase after them?  Insofar as that is concerned, the film is quite cathartic.<br /><br />One of the biggest selling points of the movie is that it maintains a great sense of humor.  It's good to see how they were able to make a lighthearted film out of what was a rather dark chapter in world history.  Typically, movies that deal with the Spainish Inquisition don't have happy endings........until now!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Give me more! Give me more! Firefly is the best series I've bought since Lord Of The Rings. The plots are good, the concept is great and  in no time at all the characters begin to feel like family. The action is hot and the whole series is adventure-packed. Tell me that Firefly has found a home for a second series....please!
B000ICLHIE|3.0|The first disc is absolutely outstanding!  Love the bluesy Louis Armstrong voice and the taunting lyrics.  I Iisten to it all the time and I'm getting to know the words.  These are classics!  They should be out in the world.  However disc 2 and 3, is this the same artist?  They are sentimental, slow songs.  My mother, age 83, loved those songs on dics 2 and 3.  I bought the album because I had heard disc 1 playing at a coffee shop in Bodega Bay,Ca. and I asked who was that artist?  And they told me it was Tom Waits, his latest album, and that he was a local.  So I bought it!
B000J4QWMC|4.0|Good movie......but if u want the old vice this is nothing like it. Acting and scenery were good. Had all the nice toys like the old series.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|After watching Al Gores movie, we bought a Hybrid vehicle.If we all do a little towards this, it will really help.Really opened our eyes to alot of things.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This DVD met my expectations in every way. Well presented and vital for everyone to see. However DVDs from the US operate on a different system to those in Asia and Australia so consequently we cannot show them on our home DVD player. I was only able to see it on my computer where I could convert playback to the PAL system. Perhaps Amazon needs to warn buyers outside the US that this might be a problem if they have the wrong format or alternatively Amazon could offer the DVD in foramts for those outside the US. <br />Syd Smith
B000HCO8IQ|1.0|I am an open minded person and I like many different genres of music but I can not beleive the praise the some are heaping on this group. It is one thing to be a cover band on a local sceen, it is another to call yourself a tribute band and tour, but the Scissor Sisters rip off so many artists that is is pathetic. Not just sounds and vibes mind you, practically entire song structures... At least when you hear Al Yankovic you know he is a put on... I had to endure this band live as they opened for Depeche Mode and it was so hard to respect their campy-rip off act. Sure, all artists borrow and steal a bit... the trick is to add something of your own to the mix... and that is where these Sisters fail. One star for being out and proud... they should save the rest for musical theater.
6304698623|5.0|I bought this movie for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas.  I think that it is the best \\"little girl\\" movie made.  I first watched it years ago before I had my daughter and I remember thinking that I was definitely going to watch this movie with my daughter some day.  My daughter loves the movie almost as much as me.  We both cry at the end.  If you have a daughter this is a must purchase in my opinion.
B000HC2LIK|3.0|After a long search, I found a copy of the theatrical version again.  Actually this was the international theatrical release, but it's close enough to what I saw originally in the theater (if it has something different in there I'm not sure what).  I have to say:  The theatrical release was SO MUCH better in my opinion than the Director's Cut.  The narration added a world of depth to the character which was just lost without it.  Also, the beautiful daylight scene at the end is haunting.  The whole mood of the movie is different.  I'd give the theatrical release 5 stars without any hesitation whatsoever.  I'd give the Director's Cut 3 at best and maybe not even that.  The director is not always right!!! <br /> <br />I hope the theatrical version will be widely available soon.  There's a whole new generation who will miss much of the depth of this wonderful movie. <br /> <br />
1582701709|4.0|A good book if you're wanting quick quotes from some of the great spiritual minds of our time but it only skims the surface.  If you're really wanting to study the true meaning of life you need to dive into deeper waters and read Emmet Fox, \\"Power Through Constructive Thinking\\". (First printing - 1932) <br />Books such as The Secret and others are important tools and if everyone took the time to read the truths inside, wars would cease to exist. <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|Received the DVD on time and in good condition.  I was very happy!
B00000K3CM|4.0|I bought this movie as one of many movies for my Dad's birthday. <br />And he loves the movie. <br /> <br />My dad loves all the home Alone mvoes with Kevin. (Not the others that followed after 2) <br /> <br />It has a few laugh Out loud scenes. <br /> <br />Many people will consider this a re-hashing of the first movie but it's trying to use the formula that made the first movie so popular. <br /> <br />My dad and I love it but if you dislike sequels that has the basic same plot as the first movie then you might not like it.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis isn't only a great sports journalist, but one of the greatest writers of my generation. He has created a new way to showcase the secret lives of sports by going behind the scenes and telling us a story of the puppeteers that control certain aspects of their game. In Moneyball, we dive in head first into the life of Oakland A's GM, Billy Beane, and how he used Bill James' analysis of baseball to create a winning team season after season. It's hard to do that today in this ever-increasing world of high contracts and young kids making millions of dollars, not knowing what to do with it. Lewis' journey amasses one season with the Oakland A's but really makes you feel like you've been there the whole time. Great book, excellent read, highly recommended!
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes was one of my favortite comic strips.  It was a sad day when Bill Watterson ended his strip.  But now with this collection of Calvin and Hobbes I can relive all the comedy and adventures of Calvin and his  outrageous  playmate Hobbes, many of which I can relate to.  For anyone who enjoyed reading the daring-duo in the comic pages, this set of books is a MUST!
B0002HYC8C|5.0|My grandson (3 1/2/ years old) loves animals and all toys that have animal figures.  He has been enthralled with his ark. It is his favorite toy and he always wants his \\"Yiayia\\" as he calls me to paly with him.
B000007492|5.0|I always liked Supertramp, and this project is a case in point.  It included songs I always liked by Supertramp (\\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Take The Long Way Home\\", and \\"Give A Little Bit\\"), but it also includes \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", a song I heard on the radio before but never realized was Supertramp.<br /><br />Additionally, I liked other songs on the project I never heard before (\\"Rudy\\", \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Ain't Nobody But Me\\" and \\"Cannonball\\").<br /><br />If you want a testimonial of how this band appeals to different types of people, look at what the people who bought this also bought.  Yes, it's a group of several late '70's artists, but I usually consider \\"The Cars\\" appeals to a different clientel than Foreigner and Kansas, yet Supertramp fans like all those other artists.

6305910189|5.0|I thought \\"Star Trek:  The Movie\\" was an extra-long, expensive TV episode.  \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" is actually a movie, starring the Star Trek characters.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban was even better here than in the original ST episode \\"Space Seed\\" (and he was good in the original).  He made an excellent villain here.<br /><br />A couple of side comments.  When Khan was introducing the surviving creature of the planet, his voice made me think of Rourke on Fantasy Island.  The other comment is something I'm sure all Trekkies caught when seeing the movie:  Khan told Chekov he never forgot a face.  Yet Chekov did not show up until the second season, while \\"Space Seed\\" was from the first season.<br /><br />Those who have read my other reviews may be aware of my division between true science fiction, science fantasy, and science horror.  The Star Trek franchise has dabbled in all three.  This story, though, falls into the true science fiction category.  The speculation is on science being able to create life.  Yes, this movie is more of an adventure than anything else, but the futuristic side is based on possibilities.<br /><br />My wife thought it was too violent; this movie may have received a PG-13 rating if that rating existed.  But I found this to be an awesome movie.
B000I5X81K|3.0|to his Closer cd.<br />I, like another reviewer, tried to like it but anybody can sing this CD, not so with his last CD.  I am sorry I bought it.  I'm also sorry to see him go, but he is headed in another direction than what made him famous.  It seems that's what always happens.  LeAnn Rimes did the same thing, in my opinion.<br />The Closer CD, was heaven.  No other words to describe it.  This one, I didn't like one song, enough to listen to it again.  The other one, I listened to it every day for months.<br />Very sad Josh Groban fan.<br />I wish everyone would critique his album and not just give the CD five stars because it's Josh Groban and he has a beautiful voice, otherwise he will continue to produce so-so songs.
6301773551|5.0|No, this is not true science fiction.  In fact, this is not supposed to be future, but to have happened a long, long, time ago in a galaxy far away.<br /><br />But this is a classic adventure.  It was pure fun, without the darkness that would follow in even \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"<br /><br />There was a book out titled \\"The Force Of Star Wars\\", seeing this movie as a Christian allegory.  It isn't, and the later movies more clearly show the eastern mysticism that Lucas believes in.  There are hints here, but not enough for me to say that promoting that view was the goal for this movie (though it may have been for the series).<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this review.  Now go have a piece of cake, and as you lift the eating untensil to your mouth . . . May the fork be with you!
B00003CWRX|5.0|This is a dark movie about a tobacco scientist who wants to come clean, a TV producer that wants his story and all the obstacles they face: tobacco companies who seem undeterred by ethics and by a network that is intimidated by the power of big tobacco. In the end, the story comes out but not until the resolves of the producer and scientist are tested.<br /><br />After watching this movie I was startled by my thoughts about the future of the press. If they had this much trouble exposing the lies the tobacco industry told how will they resist the armada of industry arrayed against global warming?<br /><br />If this review helped, please add your vote. Thanks.
0783226004|5.0|There are movies that give you the impression the actors/actresses were having the time of their lives making it.  Sneakers is a prime example of this.<br /><br />I am used to seeing Ben Kingsley (my favorite actor) portraying a historical protagonist (in the movies \\"Ghandi\\", \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"Joseph\\", and \\"Moses\\".  This is the first time I've seen him as a bad guy, and he does an excellent job at this.<br /><br />I do have some objections to this movie.  There is some sexual humor that was not necessary.  Also, I could tell that the makers of this film would love to see a one party system in politics, with the party I identify with no longer existing (this is a Hollywood movie:  of course you can guess which party is picked on here!)<br /><br />But these are minor points.  This is a creatively written movie.  The acting, as stated, is enjoyable to watch.  I would definitely recommend it.

0688101364|5.0|I have enjoyed Rose's other baking books because she makes recipes do-able for bakers who have varying levels of knowledge and ability. I love to cook and bake but some cookbooks I've bought along the way seem to go out of their way to make their recipes a bit difficult, or have a snooty approach to ingredients and technique (like...it's practically a crime to re-roll cookie dough scraps!). This book has recipes that any of us can bake, no matter how much experience we have - everything I've ever made has turned out to be attractive AND tasty! A practical, beautifully illustrated book that you'll return to use each Christmas, or whenever you're in the mood to bake cookies. A great gift if you pair it with some cookies you've made yourself! <br />
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the 2-3 best Dylan albums, in my opinion, since his creative heyday back in the late 60s and early/mid 70s. A great backing band, that iconic voice, and the usual short stories posing as songs. Bob, we missed you for most of the last 30 years or so, so welcome back!
B000J103PC|1.0|I had very low expectations when I rented this and the outcome was this was worse than expected. Not funny one little bit,  horrible to annoying acting ALL around, though Meryl was functional as the mean lady cartoon character.  What pizazz Meryl did manage to convey only made the other little ingenues seem all the more like high school drama class rejects. There was nothing interesting in this bland, predictable, uninvolving story.<br />I kept comparing this to the TV show Ugly Betty, which does the sensitive outsider theme so much more creatively ( And with the talented, sparkling actress America Ferrera in the  Anne Hathaway role).<br /> Regarding the love interest played by that cute actor Adrian ...(last name???) all I kept thinking is \\"Vinnie ya need to be back with your Entourage on HBO\\".<br />One of the, no, it IS the most overrated movie of the year.
0385510438|3.0|John Grisham, long known for his legal thrillers and courtroom dramas and more recently for his heartwarming \\"down-home\\" books, combines his strengths in his latest offering, The Last Juror. With elements from all three styles of his past successes, Juror is at once riveting, suspenseful, and tender. Such a combination doesn't always work, even for a master like John Grisham, and at times the story is stilted, particularly when a major plot development seems lifted directly from a previous novel. All told, however, The Last Juror is a quick, enjoyable read with a little bit of everything readers have come to love about Grisham's books.<br /><br />The Last Juror takes us back to Clanton, Mississippi, the setting of Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill. At first, the identical setting seems incidental, until we meet familiar characters like Harry Rex, the greasy divorce attourney, and a pre-disbarrment Lucien Wilbanks, protagonist Jake Brigance's mentor from the earlier novel. Juror takes place some years prior to A Time to Kill, and we get to see these townspeople at a stage of their lives earlier than we saw them last.<br /><br />The Last Juror is the story of a town as seen through the eyes of a young but maturing newspaperman. When William Traynor moves to Clanton after college to work as a reporter for the local newspaper, he intends to stay only as long as it takes him to gain enough experience to find a real job somewhere else. But when one of the newspaper's owners dies suddenly and the other goes insane, he finds himself the new owner of the struggling weekly. Most of the book is spent seeing important town events--elections, crimes, social events, and a pivotal murder trial--through Willie's eyes.<br /><br />The murder trial turns out to be an important--but not all-important, contrary to what one might expect from the title--element of the story. Danny Padgitt is a member of a legendary local crime family with roots dating back a hundred years. When he is arrested for the murder of a young single mother, the town takes great interest in seeing a Padgitt finally brought to justice for his deeds. When he threatens his jury that if they convict him, \\"I'll get every last one of you,\\" the stage is set for a classic Grisham legal shootout. What actually develops as the book continues, however, is not exactly what one might expect.<br /><br />The book starts out as an interesting hybrid of courtroom drama, a literary style with with Grisham is expertly familiar, and small-town lore. But as the murder trial of Danny Padgitt progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that this is not a legal thriller after all. For one thing, the conflict in the first part of the book is not so much what happens in the courtroom as what happens outside of it. Unlike in A Time to Kill, where an antagonistic judge combined with a pompous district attourney (Rufus Buckley, who also shows up in Juror) comprise the bulk of the book's conflict, the defendant in Juror's trial is so obviously guilty that the courtroom scenes seem designed mainly to get Danny off to jail so the rest of the book can begin. When the trial is over, well shy of the halfway point of the book, readers expecting a thrill ride like The Firm may well be ready for the action to really heat up. What happens instead, however, is that life settles back down again for the residents of Clanton.<br /><br />The flap copy of the book advertises a legal thriller centering on the murder trial and conviction of Danny Padgitt: \\"In Mississippi in 1970, `life' didn't necessarily mean `life,' and nine years later Danny Padgitt managed to get himself paroled. He returned to Ford County, and the retribution began.\\" In reality, however, the convicted murderer doesn't get paroled until the last seventy or so pages of the 350-page book. This is most certainly not a thriller about a disgruntled convict out for revenge on the jury who convicted him. Interestingly, it's not really about the life of newspaper owner Willie Traynor, either, though he is the narrator and main protagonist. What this book is about is the town of Clanton. Grisham paints a vivid and reminiscent-feeling portrait of life in a small southern town.<br /><br />Grisham does a masterful job of hitting the highs and lows of the ten-year period in which the story takes place. Interestingly, he barely touches the race issue that plays such a prominent role in A Time to Kill. Probably this works in the book's favor, as the reader is able to enjoy life along with Willie Traynor and not get caught up too much in the more negative political realities of the period.<br /><br />The story breaks down toward the end when the lighthearted tale takes a belated turn toward Grisham's more familiar thriller genre. The thriller has worked well for Grisham over the years, but to throw it almost as an afterthought into an otherwise non-thrilling story seems like a forced departure from his usual natural style. When the climax of this segment of the story turns out to be a nearly play-by-play repeat of key events in A Time to Kill (in the same courthouse, even), the breakdown is complete.<br /><br />By setting this story as a chronological prequel to Kill, Grisham is able to show us things about the characters that we didn't know before. Unfortunately, he misses some golden opportunities. In Kill, we know that Lucien Wilbanks was disbarred; in Juror, rather than telling us how and why this occurred, we are told only that Lucien is facing disbarrment \\"in an unrelated mess.\\" We see little of Harry Rex, one of the story's more colorful characters, that we haven't seen before. The Haley family, who star in Kill, never appears.<br /><br />John Grisham has attained a literary status that affords him opportunities to experiment with different styles; thus books like Bleachers and Skipping Christmas appear on shelves next to The Firm and Street Lawyer. Whereas in the past Grisham has written either to vent on some troubling legal issue (i.e., King of Torts) or simply to show off his impressive knowledge of the legal world, his \\"home-town\\" books show a different side of this author that works well and has connected with readers. But in The Last Juror he tried to combine too many different worlds and ended up with one that works most of the time but leaves the reader feeling slightly conned.<br /><br />While perhaps not up to the standards readers have come to expect from this author, The Last Juror is a refreshing departure from the kind of rut many authors write themselves into. Grishom seems determined not to allow his work to become James Patterson-like in its one-dimensionality. Unfortunately, he tries to bring too many dimensions into play and ends up with a somewhat unstable-feeling product. Unstable or not, though, the book is enjoyable and well worth the relatively few hours it takes to cruise through. Readers will likely not think of The Last Juror as one of Grisham's better books, but my guess is they'll finish feeling like Clanton is one of America's more interesting towns.life of newspaper owner Willie Traynor, either, though he is the narrator and main protagonist.

0446528056|3.0|John, a young army recruit, grew up with his autistic dad in North Carolina. While on leave from the army,  he falls for Savannah, a young college student doing a charity project for the summer. After 2 weeks of bliss, they face a year of separation as John is based in Germany - can their relationship survive? I don't want to reveal anymore, but I thought that this story was unrealistic and there were a lot of cliches. The parts on autism are interesting but Sparks only scratches the surface and at the end of the day autism doesn't really add much to the story. Not Sparks' best.

B0001ADAVK|5.0|Long before women's liberation ever existed, there were women of independent minds.<br /><br />This story is one of such courage to be an independent woman when after being a vital part of the industrial effort of WWII.  The government was trying to make her subservient again.  Most women go along with the 'grand design' like bleating sheep going to slaughter.  There are those who see through charade and wonder if it is a good personal fit.  Others revolt, speak out and run against the grain.<br /><br />When it a collegiate professor who leads the revolt, there is trouble at all levels.  Trouble with the college administration who employs her, trouble with students who are seeing the first challenge of the entrenched system they have followed until this point of their young lives.<br /><br />The genie is out of the bottle and this time she just will not go back in!<br /><br />I thought it was a great fiction story based in a reality we all lived through if you were born immediately after the war.  It was a great look back at the 'garbage' the government tried to indoctrinate.  It was the stuff my mother went through.<br /><br />The government's and societies design clearly backfired and this story tells of just one spark that lit the fire!<br /><br />If you like finding out how things got to be the way they are, this is a story for you!  Bring your brains and be prepared to ponder issues of deep consequence.  This is not a mindless situational comedy for the thumb sucking TV watchers which are just looking for \\"something to watch\\" or \\"mindless entertainment\\" of a reality programs.<br /><br />I find myself thinking about this story frequently months after I have seen it.  Great buy!  Great story!  Great issues!  Great remembrances!  Great look back!

I'm sure there were several new scenes, but I only noticed one...<br /><br />The infamous puppet-sex scene has 2 distinct additions that fetish-freaks will appreciate and the rest of us with laugh ourselves silly over.<br /><br />Is this one addition to the movie worth it?  YES!  The special features are great too.  Kim Jong Il rocks in this movie.  Screw you Hans Brix!!

0307237699|5.0|In a world filled with chaos, wars, and all manner of suffering, Senator Obama once again inspires not only Americans, but every member of the human family living on this planet, with a real sense of hope for the future!  A brilliant writer and thinker, as well as a sincere and dedicated public servant (notice, I did not call him a \\"politician\\"!), Senator Obama shows us a way to heal the wounds of divisiveness and hatred and move on toward the soul-based sense of wholeness the common people so desperately want and need.  A unifier by nature, he is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise politically polluted, society, and I wish him every success in continuing his dedicated service to humanity across the globe.  If America can heal from the nightmare of these past 6 years, the rest of the world will be a better place, and \\"Audacity of Hope\\" gives us the roadmap to do so.  God Bless Barack Obama for caring enough for all of people!  He is the Light of America's Soul...

My three yr.old likes the \\"funny song\\" -Another One Bites the Dust & can sing it word for word-my 5 yr.old loves Killer Queen & Don't Stop Me Now & just about all the other songs on the CD. I thought they would like it because the Chicken Little movie has We are the Champions & all 3 of them sing it...& I was right.

B00008QSA5|5.0|Of its kind Supersession is the finest \\"rock n soul\\" album not only of 1968 when it was issued but of the 1960s and it stands up to anything being done today. Not only is the album (now of course a CD)remastered, but there are four bonus tracks, two of which are the originals without horns, one which hadn't been released, and an additional number. \\"Albert's Shuffle\\", \\"Man's Temptation\\", \\"His Holy Modal Majesty\\", \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Lot To Cry\\", and \\"Season of the Witch\\" are my favorites. The musicianship and the artistry are second to none. Highly recommended.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG is a sentimental favorite of mine. <br />I saw, and fell in love with, this film when I was barely 8 years old. <br />The kids, Jeremy and Jemima, are great little actors, and Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Dr. Caractacus Potts, who takes the run down former race car and transforms it into a magnificent flying car.  Sally Anne Howes is lovely.  I agree with the reviewer that the film is about 20 minutes too long, but that's my only real criticism of it.  The songs are adorable and the cinematography is for the most part stunning.  This film should be in the DVD library of every family.

Think of the warm months as destroying our planet, do you really want it to be warm.  Pay it forward - all your family, friends, and colleagues - invite them over - watch this movie.  Once you watch it, then you can decide.  The movie is well written, demonstrated, and documented.  Slide shows with Al Gore's intertwined through helps break up the fact finding.  Movie changes you.

0440418569|2.0|\\"The Golden Compass\\" is a great great book. \\"The Subtle Knife\\" was a very good second book. But \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" was a pretty big let-down. It was still readible---and if you've come this far with the two prior books, you'll probably want to read this third installment to finish it, though I can't say you'll be satisfied.   <br /> <br />Objectively speaking, it seems like Pullman let himself be rushed into finishing the series. His craft began to slowly unravel & show through until by the end, you're wondering how/why/what/huh all over the place.  <br /> <br />Such a buildup and then the  train is just off the tracks. <br /> <br />The most telling point of course (as others reviewers point out)is that of the Amber Spyglass itself--it's the title of the book, yet it's really not involved in anything nor does it mean much. That's kind of how a lot of things went in the book--which is really too bad. <br /> <br />If Mr. Pullman would like to rewrite this last book, I'd be willing to give it another shot, but it doesn't compare at all to the quality of \\"The Golden Compass\\"--which is a real classic, through and through. <br /> <br />
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I just started watching this show two months ago and can't believe how hilarious it is. How I Met Your Mother is much better than Friends and, if you're between the ages of 20-35, it's much more relatable and funny than Seinfeld. I quickly bought the Season 1 DVD set without high expectations (it seems many great shows have a lackluster first season while they are still settling into the character development) but every episode is just as funny as the current season!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Well, it was certainly the best movie *i saw*, and you have to like the comedy/drama genre. But if you do, and if you like wes anderson's movies, then you will certainly enjoy this one.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is one of those shows that you either get it and love it or don't.  While the mass majority of people will not like this show or the great characters that make up the cast, I found it great.  To those out there that are looking for a great Sci-Fi series to pick up look no further, also if you don't know already this series is the precursor to the movie Serenity.
B000002UCQ|5.0|What impresses me most about this album, as does any album regardless of genre or age demographic of the author, is the shear diversity found within. Every song leads me in a new direction, either lyrically or musically. Mr. Harrison has provided a product that stretches the distance between intimate acoustic and soaring electric with everything from folk to spiritual, from blues to soul. I wouldn't even be surprised if one should hear a tune like 'Behind That Locked Door' on a country & western radio station somewhere. Themes that could be regarded as depressing ('Art of Dying', 'All Things Must Pass') are conveyed in poignant and realistic manners and even when covering Dylan ('If Not For You') he sounds as if he wrote the song himself, which I thought was the case for many years. This is a very organic album and a great listen. The jams at the ends are pretty much filler but it's still fun to hear an early Derek & The Dominoes at work.
0446528056|4.0|I enjoyed this book and there were some nights I stayed up later than my usual so I could find out what happened next. However, some of it was disappointing.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corrine has a very fresh, distinct voice. Her voice reminds me of Minnie Ripperton with Meshell Ndegeocello's beat in the background. It's wonderful. In this day of imitations & wannabes, it's good to hear something new, for a change.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I have to say - before I got this album I read the negative reviews and I was very skeptical.  But being a long time Incubus fan I was going to get it no matter what.  So after listening to it for the first I had only one thing to say to the people that wrote negative reviews.......what the hell are you guys smoking???????  If you're a so-so fan this album is a good album, if you are a big time fan then this album is great (everything you expected and more).  If you are thinking about getting this album - DO NOT LISTEN to the negative reports - they are completely false.  I have not been able to put this album down since I've gotten it and neither will you.  The only people that should not buy this album are people that do not like good music...period.
