1451695195|4.0|What drew me to this text more so than any other about NDE's, was that it was scribed by a neurosurgeon, renowned for their mechanical/rational view of consciousness. For those scientists whose feet are firmly planted in this particular camp, the notion of the spirit as something separate from the workings of the brain brinks on the absurd. Before Alexander's coma due to E-coli, an illness for adults that occurs in around one in ten million people, and to fully recover is nothing less than miraculous. The doctor's `conscious experiences' while in this coma for seven days, is the books purpose: to report to fellow medical colleagues and the layman that consciousness does in fact go beyond our current understanding of the brain.<br /><br />What is so different in Alexander's account to other such experiences is that he was not `aware' of his earthly identity which, according to the author, enabled him to `travel' further into realms of consciousness or dimensions.<br /><br />There is a quote from a well- known physicist that if the concepts of Quantum Mechanics have not scared you in anyway, you've not understood the discoveries. Doctor Alexander touches on Quantum theory in this book and interlinks the notions of NDE's and his experiences while in a coma, adeptly.<br /><br />It is well known to some that science has moved so far that spirituality/philosophy is now being explored by scientists to help explain the unexplainable. Alexander has made a valuable contribution to this project.<br /><br />If you have any interest in NDE's, this is the text to read as it, in one way, helps us understand the phenomenon, but also raises more questions, than it does, answers...

It is a great classic bit of entertainment!
B006OFN0SE|2.0|Hoover was PATHELOGICAL, bi polar and extremely hypocritical. I see why we are in the mess we're in because he had so many closet issues of his own that he needed to watch other people, spy on them, listen in on them, deport them & criminalize them so that it kept him from taking a good look at himself. He was the worst person to ever walk this Earth. Leonardo did a great job.

B00AGKH7K0|3.0|I've always like Eric Burdon, especially when he was with the Animals.  Followed him through the trip years and beyond to Eric Burdon and the Animals and Eric Burdon and War and even beyond that to his solo stuff.<br /><br />To me, like all the artists back then, his music has lost its power.  His strongest stuff was when he did the pure blues, which was what the early Animals were all about.  Although I enjoyed &#34;Monterey&#34; and &#34;We Are One&#34; and all the music back in his trip days, to War, afterwards he seemed to have taken a different route.<br /><br />Other than the album with Jimmy Witherspoon, he hasn't stayed true to form.  He keeps wanting to mix blues with whatever rock form he wants to adopt now and call it music.<br /><br />It doesn't work for me.  To me, he says he likes the blues - then sing the blues!

B004CLYKLI|4.0|This is a delightful book, and the most interesting that I have read in a while.  It is also a curious book.  In terms of language and writing style, this book by the Yale law professor is American in outlook.  However, the obstinancy that she expresses is definitely traditional Chinese.<br /><br />I thought I knew Chinese parents.  I had two; my son has two.  And I live in Hong Kong, China.  Nevertheless, I must say that Amy Chua tops all the Chinese parents that I have known (and I have known many, from different generations).  Although I disagree largely with her parenting model, I enjoy reading the fascinating tale that Amy tells about how she drove her daughters to fulfil her vision of achievement and perfection.  The reader notices early on in the book that Amy's younger daughter, Lulu, is not one who would bend to her mother's will.  Therein lies the suspense that has the reader glued to the book.  Most interesting that it took an equally obstinate younger daughter and two dogs to deter the Tiger Mother.<br /><br />The book is also thought-provoking.  While reading, I have constantly reflected on the deficiency of the Chinese model of parenting, as described by Amy in her personal account.  The model is one that is very effective in training skills and crafts.  Amy's two daughters are evidently talented musical artists, helped to a great extent by the ceaseless drilling that their mother has put them through.  Such apprentice drilling has its limits, though.  The apprentice is not taught or encouraged to think.  For generations, China has trained its people to be good with multiplication tables, and skilled with musical instruments, in sports or carpentry.  But such drilling only produces skilled craftsmen (or craftspersons, to be politically correct).  Creative and critical thinking has been discouraged, if not entirely ignored.  'Ah-ha!  But the Tiger Mother's parenting model cannot produce scientists,' I would say to myself as I read through the book.  This thought is confirmed towards the end of the book, when Amy talks about the exception in her family: her rebellious scientist father.<br /><br />The Conclusion and Afterword in Amy's book are superb.  They bring the suspenseful jouney of the Tiger Mother to a fitting end.  For the benefit of potential readers, I will not give away the ending here.s thought is confirmed towards the end of the book, when Amy talks about the exception in her family: her rebellious scientist father.<br /><br />The Conclusion and Afterword in Amy's book are superb.

0307269981|4.0|I was sent an \\"ARC\\" (advanced readers copy) of this book several years ago. I read the first book and enjoyed it but had a hard time with the more violent and sadistic bits of it.

My daughter (yes, she is an adult) picked it up, greatly enjoyed it and read the next one too.<br /><br />So, having not finished the book and after getting half way through never intending to finish it, why am I writing this review? Because I have been told by Amazon that I must given that I accepted the \\"ARC\\" of this book. Not our agreement when I accepted it but, nevertheless the powers that be say I must review it now. If you really want a good review of the book obviously this is not it and I am sorry to have wasted your time.

0783230370|5.0|Although it has some editing problems, this is a great movie. When I first heard about it, I thought it was going to be a satire but it is actually very perceptive and compassionate. Arnold S plays a scientist who gets pregnant as part of testing a new drug but things do not go as planned and the results are hilarious. He used his wife's pregnancies as his model for how a pregnant woman would act and imitated it very well. He never comes across as a homosexual even as the drugs he is taking make him take on more and more aspects of femininity. It is well worth watching.

0385349831|4.0|Paulo Coelho is best known for The Alchemist, a book I have not read--although I have read some of the works it imitates. His latest work, Manuscript Found in Accra, is classified as fiction while clearly endeavoring to convey philosophical and religious ideas to the reader.<br /><br />The author uses the device of the found manuscript--that is, the fictional content of the book is presented as being from a manuscript from the 11th century which was found by chance. Coelho creates a fictional backstory for the finding of the manuscript. He also crafts a fictional backstory for the creation of the work: in 1099 the crusaders are about to invade Jerusalem. A wise man, known as the Copt, is asked various questions by the people who have remained in the city. These questions and his answers are written down by one of those present and the manuscript is hidden for safe-keeping, only to be discovered centuries later.<br /><br />The work is clear and well written (or, more accurately, well translated by Margaret Jull Costa) and is thus an easy read. While the book has 190 pages, it should be noted that the work is double-spaced, the question for each section appears on its own page (with a following blank page) and the margins are robust. As such, the work is also a quick read.<br /><br />While I am a professional philosopher, I did endeavor to read the book from two perspectives. The first, obviously enough, is that of a professional philosopher. The second is that of a casual reader.<br /><br />From my casual reader perspective, the work proved to be an interesting light read. While the author does not go into any real depth, the presentation of Big Ideas in a casual manner does provide some light entertainment and, more importantly, did get me thinking about the ideas raised. As such, I liked the book and can say that it would appeal to those who enjoy the presentation of Big Ideas in the context of fiction.<br /><br />From my professional philosopher standpoint, the work also proved to be an interesting light read. The author borrows heavily and obviously from various traditions such as Taoism and Christianity and there is not much in the way of original thought here. The author also clearly seems to be trying to imitate the Socratic Method by presenting the Big Ideas in the context of a discussion. However, the intellectual rigor and depth of the full Socratic Method is absent--this is casual conversation with some Big Ideas and not a serious philosophical examination of values. The author also seems to have been influenced by Confucius' Analects in that there is a wise man speaking his words of wisdom (without any supporting argumentation) to listeners and these words are written down by one of the followers/students.<br /><br />The comparison to Confucius seems especially apt since the author is employing a method commonly used by the classic Eastern philosophers, namely appealing to intuitions and engaging in storytelling. This is in contrast with classic Western philosophy of the sort done by Plato and Aristotle: rigorous argumentation and in-depth analysis. However, the practice of philosophizing by storytelling has gained considerable traction in contemporary Western philosophy, although it is often dismissed on the obvious ground that telling stories is not a substitute for argumentation.<br /><br />Since the work is being marketed as fiction, it is certainly tempting to simply say that the lack of argumentation and intellectual rigor is not a big deal. After all, while these things are expected in a work of philosophy (Big Ideas require equally Big Arguments), the standards of fiction are far weaker in this regards. Crudely put, while a philosopher must prove her points, the author of fiction must merely tell a good story. Thus, the question would seem to be whether or not Coelho tells a good story. While there is nothing exceptional about the work, a decent story is told reasonably well. However, Coelho (or at least thefolks marketing his book) have the view that it is more than just telling a story for the amusement of the reader. Rather, the book is cast as presenting Big Ideas.<br /><br />Looked at this way, the work could be seen as engaged in the philosophical method of the appeal to intuition. An intuition is a blend of how one thinks and feels about a matter prior to reflection. Crudely put, it is sort of a \\"gut\\" reaction. Naturally, a \\"gut\\" reaction is not an argument for a claim. An argument is when reasons are provided in support of a claim.<br /><br />In the case of an appeal to intuition, the goal of the method is to \\"motivate\\" the reader's intuitions so s/he accepts the claims being presented. This makes the method a blend between persuasion and argumentation.<br /><br />It is an argument to the degree that the goal is to support a position by providing reasons. It is also persuasion in that the goal is also to get the audience accept a view because the author has presented something that appeals to their intuitions. That is, the goal is to make the audience feel as the authors wants them to feel so that they will think as the author wants them to think. A major weak point of this method is that intuitions are obviously intuitions and not the result of reflection and argument. Because of that fact, this method is strong and effective with people who share intuitions, but tends to be weak and ineffective with people who do not share the same intuitions.<br /><br />The Big Ideas presented in the book do have intuitive appeal, mainly because they are Big Ideas that have been presented elsewhere (sometimes with arguments backing them up). Naturally, those whose intuitions match these ideas will find the book appealing while those who do not will probably not.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for a light read that dabbles in telling stories about Big Ideas, you will probably like this work of fiction. If you are looking for something with philosophical depth, then you will want to keep looking.folks marketing his book) have the view that it is more than just telling a story for the amusement of the reader.

An argument is when reasons are provided in support of a claim.<br /><br />In the case of an appeal to intuition, the goal of the method is to \\"motivate\\" the reader's intuitions so s/he accepts the claims being presented. This makes the method a blend between persuasion and argumentation.<br /><br />It is an argument to the degree that the goal is to support a position by providing reasons. It is also persuasion in that the goal is also to get the audience accept a view because the author has presented something that appeals to their intuitions. That is, the goal is to make the audience feel as the authors wants them to feel so that they will think as the author wants them to think. A major weak point of this method is that intuitions are obviously intuitions and not the result of reflection and argument. Because of that fact, this method is strong and effective with people who share intuitions, but tends to be weak and ineffective with people who do not share the same intuitions.<br /><br />The Big Ideas presented in the book do have intuitive appeal, mainly because they are Big Ideas that have been presented elsewhere (sometimes with arguments backing them up). Naturally, those whose intuitions match these ideas will find the book appealing while those who do not will probably not.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for a light read that dabbles in telling stories about Big Ideas, you will probably like this work of fiction. If you are looking for something with philosophical depth, then you will want to keep looking.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|VERY GOOD PLOT LINES.  THE WRITERS ARE GREAT AND KEEP ME COMING BACK FOR MORE.  THE REGULAR CHARACTERS ARE LIKEABLE.
B0098466CK|4.0|The fourth full-length from Texas-based collective The Sword finds the band powerfully doing what they do best: Doling out piles and piles of ginormous riffage, colossal, conquering grooves, viscerally rumbling bass lines, and fantastical, epic lyrics (which are spewed by Ozzy Osbourne-worshipping vocalist J.D. Cronise). And, of course, 2012's \\"Apocryphon\\" might occasionally venture into more melodic and head-trip-esque territory, but it is just a matter of time before the band emerge with another Titanic-sized, foundation-shaking, and eminently memorable riff that abruptly takes the song back into the heavy, propulsive soil that birthed it.<br /><br />On the whole, the album falls somewhere between Black Sabbath, Mastodon, High On Fire, Pentagram, Motorhead, and Judas Priest. The opening \\"The Veil Of Isis\\" adheres to a catchy, Sabbath-esque galloping groove, and is tattooed by crunching guitar licks and crashing cymbals. The next song, \\"Cloak Of Feathers,\\" then, is centered around a meaty, moaning, Tony Iommi-copped riff; but it is a highlight because it briefly opens up for some clearly audible -- and surprisingly technical and nimble-fingered -- bass lines. \\"Arcane Montane\\" is another big standout on account of it flirting with some exceptional guitar soloing. And it is further highlighted by a lumbering, swamp-bred main riff, and a strong, grumbling bass line. \\"The Hidden Masters\\" opens with a proggy-sounding string arrangement reminiscent of vintage Deep Purple. But, yes, it soon downshifts to a memorable, grumbling, downtuned main riff that practically screams \\"classic, trance-inducing stoner metal.\\"<br /><br />The album's centerpiece, \\"Dying Earth,\\" is like the track that preceded it in that it opens on a surprisingly experimental note, with a trippy, new-wavy synth intro that promptly slams into blistering thrash territory, with an up-tempo, massively pounding main riff and some good, shredding guitar solo work. The song also stands out for being the largely instrumental piece that it is. \\"Execrator\\" is another up-tempo, and near speed-metal-worthy bruiser, and one that is filled with memorably hooky, galloping guitar crunch. But back on the more mid-tempo side of the line, \\"Seven Sisters\\" is a thunderous romp whose towering, pure doom riffage evokes \\"Paranoid\\"-era Black Sabbath almost to the tee. And the subsequent song, \\"Hawks & Serpents,\\" is another ominously crunchy and down-tempo chugger, though it is one that features a nicely melodic bit of soloing.<br /><br />\\"Eyes Of The Stormwitch\\" continues in this vein, as a forebodingly doomy cut with a pounding, pummeling riff and some tasty, Zakk Wylde-styled solo flights. And then \\"Apocryphon\\" closes with the really catchy title song, which abides by a memorably hooky and head-bangable, Black Sabbath vs. Iron Maiden gallop, some new wave-tinged keyboard flourishes, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing. But all of this, of course, trades off with a dramatic, densely churning main guitar lick.<br /><br />Simply put, you can point out the lack of a musical leap forward taken (or not taken) by The Sword, here; but at the end of the day, there is very little about \\"Apocryphon\\" that you can honestly complain about. So while some other bands might be more diverse, brilliantly written, and/or structurally complex, few modern metallists can drop the almighty doom metal hammer quite as mightily and/or satisfyingly as The Sword.instrumental piece that it is. \\"Execrator\\" is another up-tempo, and near speed-metal-worthy bruiser, and one that is filled with memorably hooky, galloping guitar crunch.

B00005NKKV|3.0|This CD contains one great recording (\\"The Sound of Silence\\").  The rest are mediocre at best.  No \\"Mrs Robinson\\" or other great songs that made them famous.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I was lucky enough to hear about the free Kindle edition offering of this book on Twitter. I was so interested in the book (there was quite a buzz on the Twitters from the DevOps crowd) that I downloaded the Kindle software client (since not a Kindle owner), and then downloaded the book. It was a great story, but the problems poor Bill (the protagonist) faces in the first half were pretty unbelievable (until I read on Gene's blog that the plot line was based upon someone's reality! <gulp!>) Eventually, through the principles the book is meant to teach (see [...]for the list) Bill and his team overcome the long odds, defeat the evil antagonist (yay! she had it coming) and saves the company (which interestingly enough is not a tech company, but rather a traditional manufacturing firm.)    I could not put the book down until I finished it, always the hallmark of a great story. Not only did I identify with elements of the story (as would almost anyone who works in IT in a big enough place) but it gave me insight into a whole world of tools that I've only heard mentioned, but never thought would apply to me (which I now know will be very valuable indeed.) If you are in IT and strive for excellence in your profession, and/or are looking for some ways to fix the traditional \\"us against them\\" mentality that so often pervades IT, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this book and read it.
B009QA3VY2|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was old-fashioned, as I knew it would be.  But the descriptions were good and the attachment to a house and a home was well done.  I've forgotten names, but the woman who had grown up in Howards End was the only likeable person in the family.  I was very happy that she won in the end.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Remember being a ten year old and seeing Star Wars the first time - a great movie takes you in and makes you believe you are part in the show. You leave your seat and are their with the characters on thier quest. That feeling total emersion comes to me few and far between at movies. John Carter pulled it off - this is sci-fi fantasy at is roots. A great mix of plot, action, and effects. Many critics have said this seemed like a combination of other movies, that my friends, is because many other movies are base on Burroughs work. Burroughs once said \\"I write escape to escape poverty.\\" I say in order to escape you must yearn to be free. Enjoy the show!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book about one year in the life of a boy with a facial deformity.  So good that I read it in 3 hours!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I've never been a huge fan of legal TV dramas but this one is excellent. I like all the characters, plots. storylines and episodes. I highly recommend it.
B00A83075M|5.0|Disney's new animation film \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" follows the story of Ralph, a \\"villain\\" of an arcade game \\"Fix-It Felix, Jr.\\" But Ralph is only playing the role of a villain. What he really wants to be is a hero.<br /><br />To win a hero's medal, Ralph leaves the world of an 8-bit game machine where he has been \\"working\\" for thirty years. After causing havoc in a first-person shooting game world (where he learns that a modern game is very \\"violent\\"), Ralph meets Vanellope, a cute little girl who is a character of a racing game \\"Sugar Rush.\\"<br /><br />The film's premise looks simple at first, but as the story unfolds, the film has much more to offer, with a handful of clever twists and turns, as well as rich colors and detailed movements of game characters. The story of Ralph and Vanellope is sweet, reflecting the film's theme of friendship and self-discovery, but not too sweet, with credible character interactions.<br /><br />The old-fashioned games at arcade would make some adult viewers feel nostalgic, but the film does not rely on the idea to entertain us. There are also so many references to video games (a certain character is now \\"out of work\\"), but it is interesting and likable characters that move the plot forward. \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" is a great example of Disney at its best. It is hugely enjoyable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best show on television. I highly recommend the show to everyone who has not seen it. Brilliant acting, cinematography, costumes, storylines, etc.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is an epic-scale movie that almost runs three hours. And it is not just a long movie. It is a tapestry of six tales woven together, six tales set in six different eras. Each story employs cinematic genre conventions: comedy, historical drama, sci-fi thriller, post-apocalyptic action, etc.<br /><br />Actors including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant play different roles in each story arc. All threads are thematically connected to each other in various ways. A certain phrase or action recurs throughout the \\"main\\" storyline. This is an ambitious project, something like modern-day version of D.W. Griffith's \\"Intolerance.\\" And like \\"Intolerance,\\" \\"Cloud Atlas\\" failed at the box office.<br /><br />So is the film so bad? I found some narrative threads are weak, but at least I wasn't bored. The film itself is not hard to follow. The skillful editing that connects six narratives seamlessly is just wonderful. As to the film's content, while some viewers find \\"Cloud Atlas\\" thought-provoking, others will find it rather shallow and pretentious. I happened to fall in the latter group, though I admit the way the film keeps telling its stories like Scheherazade is fascinating.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski of \\"Matrix\\" fame, and Tom Tykwer, best known for \\"Run Lola Run.\\" If you have seen these two films, where style takes precedence over substance, you know what you are in for. Whether the intricate narrative of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a groundbreaking achievement or a once only gimmick remains to be seen. I for one enjoyed watching the film, but I would rather watch only the Sonmi arc featuring terrific Doona Bae again in a conventional narrative.
0762777931|4.0|I just finished a 60 day clean eating program. I read a lot of book reviews before starting, and this was the first one I read. I would agree the tone is a little annoying, but Kris Carr has done her homework and this book is a treasure trove of information to help you learn and get smart about what to eat, what to avoid, and why. On the downside, there are barely any recipes, so if you are looking for recipes, this book is not for you. The book includes a 21 days cleanse, which I guess is supposed to leverage the 8 pages of smoothie, salad, and meal recipes at the back of the book. All the 21 day cleanse includes are a bunch of affirmations and tips to keep you motivated. It would have been better if there were 21 days of recipes.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I have tried several calculators on my Kindle and this is one of the ones I am keeping around.  It's a great simple calculator.  It doesn't do things that Geeks like me frequently use like Hex to Decimal conversions and the use of Parentheses.  But if  you are just adding a list of numbers etc.  it's great, the buttons are big, it has the standard memory functions (MC, M+, M-, MR).  Great calculator for most people.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love, love, love this show. Best show on TV at the moment. It kind of combines Hannibal Lecter with 24. Great action, fast paced, good storyline. I highly recommend the show.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm rereading the books as I watch the HBO show and this book could be the best in the series.  I'm thrilled that they will be splitting this book across the two seasons.  I had forgotten how gripping these books were and this one also has scenes that I was stuck awake thinking about.
B009K0P10K|3.0|This show is a guilty pleasure. Season 2 is not as good as season 1 and has had some less than stellar episodes, but overall I continue to watch and enjoy the show.
B0086700CM|2.0|Played it a few times. Was very primitive and not at all fun. Repetition gets you higher points but what is the Point?
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A great journey that proves its never too late to reflect on the past and pave a new road for the future.  Harold Fry is an ordinary man that influences many on his own personal journey, once again demonstrating that we can all leave our mark on the world in our own unique way.  The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a simple story, yet will leave you totally fulfilled and inspired to pave your own journey in life.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is great.  You just have to be patient and you wont have to spend anything.  It takes more energy to search the rooms but why be in a hurry.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. It's got a great story and a healthy mix of humor, horror, and suspense. The only downside is that the dialogue sometimes goes too slow and medium difficulty puzzles. The sequel has faster dialogue and harder puzzles but you have to beat this completely before playing the sequel or else it won't make as much sense.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Would like to see this be alittle bigger.  It's fairly easy, good for when you don't really want to think.
B004NSURT4|4.0|Not quite what I expected - 3 and 1/2 more than four but very readable and wets my appetite for more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Can't get enough. If you're wondering about it...dont wait anymore. If you've played this game chances are you're just back to download it on another device:)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great app for kids any age. I'm not 13. I'm 8. But just get this game straight away.<br />This free game is tons of fun. Some games are easy some are hard.<br />My one of my brothers loves the race car game. But you have to buy that one.<br />You can use real money. But not to buy games. Kids get points for playing the games<br />that are locked.
B0000067L2|3.0|You would never know.  He is mixed so far down it's hard to hear him.  I know that was the sound of these sixes albums.  The remaster actually needs to be remixed.  Trash the original mix ad start from scratch with modern technology.  Just like they did for Let It Be... Naked.  That said I still love the music.  I just wish it was clearer.  You'd never know Cream was considered to be the loudest band around.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is exiting fun and supper addictive I could easily play this game forever5/5 a must download and its free
B0024HH32A|5.0|Mash depicts the Korean conflict from the eyes of the Medical personnell.  How they deal with the sadness and loss of life, horrible living conditions and yet maintain their sanity through it all.  The actors in the original movie are a terrific blend of characters and the creative ways to have fun (At the expense of Frank and Hot Lips).  Hot Lips shower scene was va-va-voom-arific! The series can never begin to compare to the movie...
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If you can't say something good about it, why bother. I was told it had a good story but I couldn't find it. Not my style.
B003VANOFY|3.0|As a wireless headset, it is amazing. It looks, feels, and sounds great, the mic is fantastic.<br /><br />But as stated in my g700 mouse review, the logitech software conflicts with each other, I own a logitech g510 keyboard and it completely interferes with the headset software and sometimes they short each other out and I have to replug both of them and go through a ton of crap.<br /><br />Logitech software is the worst. Period. I might even go back to razer keyboards, and my last one was terrible, but at least the software was good. :/
B005FPT51K|1.0|If you don't read anything else, DON'T BUY THIS!<br /><br />I've had to tough it out with this monitor for a little over a year now.  When I first set it up around March 2012, it was ok, not perfect, but it did the job.  It has progressively gotten worse over the year.  I'm at the point now, where it doesn't even work. When I launch the app (on a good launch), I can view the room, but the loading icon just spins in front of it. I can't rotate or tilt the camera on my own, I can't even see video longer than a second before it freezes up and starts loading, and honestly, a second is being generous.  The loader rarely goes away and when it does go away, the connection is still crappy.  My house has a 50mb/s wifi connection and my wifi at work is even better than that, so there is no \\"slow connection\\" causing these issues.  This is happening on my iPhone and my iPad.  Very frustrated and annoyed because this crap cost a pretty decent amount of money.
B00B9HPP7Q|3.0|Man, I have followed SB for years and they push this one out like its really special,i was not ... Matter fact a little disappointing knowing that these are the best musicians you can get anywhere and they put out this? Try again guys. I listened to this thing like 5 times now and it does not have that 'spark\\" that SB records have. Even the guitar solos(sorry guys) were quite lame. The endings of each song was really lame and just left you there... wow I will wait for the next one to  be better...
B0041KKYEM|5.0|good price and quality.<br />1 2 3 4 4 3 4 67 5 3 2 54 6 4 3 2

B005VPSEK2|5.0|I love Kelly Clarkson and this is simply the best CD that she has released yet!  I absolutely love all of these songs
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun! It has so many different places that change that you can go to.It changes from time to time but has different missions what makes it even funner
0810989956|5.0|My son is a big fan of the series. He read all the books in a few days and then went back and read them again. He wanted something new, but since I can't force Jeff Kinney to hurry up and write more quickly, I went and got this, figuring it would at least be something to tide him over. He loved it!<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that it lets kids be creative in the same vein as the series. For kids familiar with the series, it's a lot of fun to delve in and feel like you are making yourself a part of it in a way. You get to make your own comics and drawings, and you get an idea of how Mr. Kinney goes about making the books. My son kept himself busy for quite some time with this.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I guess from all the hype I was expecting something salacious and well written, I got neither. It's a mediocre book and the writing is sophomoric.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|One of my favorite animated movies so far. Entertaining for adults as well. Love it! I could watch this over and over again.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|If you like space and want to feel like a spec in the universe, this is it.<br />Also cool with surround sound, my kids and I felt the vibrations from Shuttle liftoff.<br />Would recommend if you are into space stuff.  Where else are you going to fly a gazillion miles into space without the radiation!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing from many women how great this book was I was expecting something good. There is no substance to this book. It is predictable and unrealistic even in a fantasy sense. I would not recommend reading this book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This ia the Best book I've read in a very long time. I couldn't put it down. Now Bring on the movie!
B006ZNRD06|1.0|i didn't want to use it, it was redundant on my Kindle Fire, i'm not sure why i got it in the first place.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Really useful to see how much time I have for each thing,be it reading or game play. Also handy to see how long it will take to charge.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a great app to play when you're bored but when there's an update it does take a long time!
B001GCUO16|4.0|This one has a little more action and brutality than the other X-Men that have come out. Good movie, great on Blu-Ray.
B00BYOEZTI|2.0|I figured this movie would be near the same quality as &#34;the rings&#34; triology, but it's not.  It's another example of taking good momentum and a popular story and cheapening it with extra dramatic scenese and CGI enhanced action sequences.  Too much fluff has been inserted to turn what should have been one movie into three.
B004G6009U|4.0|I got this movie even though I figured I wouldn't like it. Hated it the first time I watched it. From there it has grown on me and it has become a favorite to my children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I feel like this story is a part of my life now! This series makes me love drama. And I'm not a huge fan of dramatic series. My favorite show right now hands down and this season is the opposite of dull.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I enjoyed this book and agreed with much of what was written.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to<br />Succeed in life. Thank you.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Especially Would recommend for the 50 plus group.That is too many words required for a review and still need more
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have no complaints! This game is very addicting and more realistic than the first.  I loove it! very challenging
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Stephen King does an amazing job breaking down the elements of good fiction.  I found the book to be very personable.  The reader feels as thought they've invited Stephen King over for tea.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Fits perfectly.  Nicely made.  Has a nice strip handle on the front of the case.  I thought it was a great bargain for the price, along with good quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and exciting but it to expansive to open up the up grades and characters.Beside when the game get going there KNOW incentive if you can not catch anything.I play to see how fast you can go!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is wonderful.me my  older brother(age15) and younger (age3) all play.we like to compare<br />Scores and try to beat each other's.I love the keys now we're if you die it gives a chance to save your self.I love to get new characters.MUST GET THIS GAME!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever. The most addicting . You can not put this game up once you get started. Its a fun game for the kids and terns. We all at high school play it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good overall story line and cinematography. I know why some don't like it but It does end in a positive message.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My son was reading this book with his 8th grade class. He was able to highlight and read with the kindle.The book is full of suprises.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I read The Infernal Devices before this series, and I think it tied in very well with this book. However, I had a hard time relating to the characters. Maybe it's because I got so attached to Will, Jem, and Tessa. I feel about the same about this book as Clockwork Angel. I liked it, but I had hoped it would have been better. I would have given it 5 stars, but I wasn't really impressed with the weird twist at the end. It kind of threw me off, but I guess that's why it's called a twist. Anyway, I'm sure it will amaze me as The Infernal Devices did. I just need to be patient.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This is a great show and having it on my kindle, I can watch it anytime. Can't wait to buy season 2
B009EEFTMC|2.0|this game is cool at first but you end up getting board after a while. they were not greative enough with the backgroung. They could have done levels like other games.

B008TMA1LY|4.0|My 5 yr old girl loves this game. Initially it's very easy for her to pick it up and she loves being able to change the decorations and tables and chairs. Eventually she had enough points to get more tables and chairs, but this ended up being too much. There's enough gameplay right off the bat for younger kids to be entertained for hours. It's fun to manage customers, food, cleaning tables, making food and then having them pay their bill. That's about it.

B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Downloaded and I could never open the game. Sad because I have read previous reviews. I am gonna try to download for a third time
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's really too bad that when this was first on tv they played it out of sequence. Watch from beginning to end one of the best television series ever made. A science-fiction/western combo that everyone from either genre will love. Follow it up with the Movie Serenity and you have a full weekend!
1400069807|5.0|So skillful is Michael Moss's journalism that \\"Sal Sugar Fat\\" reads as compellingly and effortlessly as good fiction, and by introducing characters and settings, has as cinematic quality that reminded me of watching a documentary than reading a non-fiction book.<br /><br />Which is a very good thing, given the importance and timeliness of the subject matter.  Salt, fat, and perhaps especially, sugar, are what we're really talking about when we discuss the national obesity and diabetes epidemics, and no one has laid the issues barer than Moss does here.  From board rooms to laboratories to supermarket shelves and kids' TV shows, Moss exposes the methods, some subtle and some blunt, by which the food giants manipulate our cravings and lack of self-control to ensure massive profits.<br /><br />Implicit in all of this is a nagging question: What moral responsibility DOES an industry have to citizens?  What responsibility does GOVERNMENT have to help protect the citizenry from itself?  Whether or not its good policy, SHOULD sugary drinks have an upward size limit?  These questions are surprisingly vexing in a democratic, capitalistic society.  Moss gestures at some solutions but does not suggest a complex, comprehensive suite of policies.<br /><br />\\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" itself is part of the solution, because the education it provides is not only alarming (and grimly entertaining in that \\"ah, NOW I see\\" way of a good exposition), but practical as well.  Armed with new insights about what's really in Big Food's offerings, I have become a better reader of food ingredients and nutritional information.  Changes have already ensued, too.  I now buy only cereals that have NO added sugar, putting ME back in control of how sweet I want things to be.  After several weeks of this, I find that my sweetness set-point has changed.  Last time I had chicken, the skin tasted sweet to me, and I read the incredients.  Sure enough. Sugar on my chicken.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love Swiftkey. The application is so intuitive and easy to use. I held off getting it until they added swipe capabilities. It is absolutely worth the price.

B004S5C91Q|5.0|Hard to put down but found it very difficult to read, as I didn't always want to know what would happen next. Scary themes and concepts, superbly written. An edge of your seat book.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|Loving it. I received it quickly and it was everything I expected. I will be ordering more cds soon. Thanks
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The protagonists were too vague for me to get my mind around. I am basically a simple guy who likes cowboys, unless I'm focusing on the holy spirit abiding in me.

B000053VAF|1.0|&quot;Why Treaclegloch&quot; you may well ask, &quot;are you reviewing a movie that was released 13 years ago in human time?&quot; The answer is simple; outrageously false propaganda if it is crafted well enough and aimed at the right audience has no expiration date.  Witness the ever popular Protocols of the Elders of Zion; numerous times it's been utterly exposed as a 19th century plagiaristic creation of the Tsarist Okrana but it keeps being disseminated and quoted &quot;as fact&quot; by anti-Semites in every generation since then. Cater to the humans' fears and resentments and even the turgid Protocols will be palatable to their stunted perceptions and reasoning.<br /><br />How much easier the job of misleading the humans is when the poison is coated with the sweetness of humor.  It is simply amazing how much cruelty, depravity, and lies a human will swallow if a tempter can convince his patient &quot;that's funny!&quot;  Even so, it seems-- no, it is obvious writer and director Kevin Smith knew he had his work cut out for him in getting audiences to put their discerning minds into solitary confinement while the rest of their mental facilities &quot;had fun&quot;.  The opening credits begin with an actual injunction to do this very thing!<br /><br />&quot;Disclaimer: 1) a renunciation of any claim to or connection with; 2) a disavowal; 3) a statement made to save one's own ass.<br />Though it'll go without saying ten minutes or so into these proceedings, View Askew would like to state that this film is- from start to finish- a work of comedic fantasy, not to be taken seriously. To insist that any of what follows is incendiary or inflammatory is to miss our intention and pass undue judgment; and passing judgment is reserved for God and God alone (this goes for you film critics too... just kidding)...&quot;<br /><br />Smith demands a double standard; HE can pass judgment and ridicule and mock the Enemy's Church and its teachings as being ridiculous and irrational and sexist, but anyone else who points out the film's bigotry, shallowness, and deliberate inaccuracies (e.g. &quot;lies&quot;) is being &quot;thin-skinned&quot;, &quot;literal-minded&quot;, and above all, &quot;humorless&quot;.  Still, there is more than a whiff of desperation in Smith's &quot;disclaimer&quot;. Likely he realized just how hypocritical he was going to be and decided to deflect some understandable backlash by using the &quot;it's just a work of &quot;fiction/fantasy/comedy/art&quot; defense used to perfection by the likes of Oliver Stone and Dan Brown.<br /><br />As a work of &quot;fiction/fantasy/comedy/art&quot; the film is a mess. It is a good thing Smith's established audience, either in theatrical release or post-release recordings, is well-noted for further debilitating their already corrupt intelligence by means of self-medication. A sober human is quite likely to find Dogma's pretensions to comedic-criticism not only exceedingly trite and not very funny, but also incoherent.<br /><br />The prime example of Dogma's internal inconsistency is it concedes the objective truth that the Enemy did grant the Catholic Church, through the office of Peter, the charism of infallibility in matters of faith and morals when the Church said she was speaking on such matters definitely and decisively.  Then in blatant contradiction to this clearly stated point, all through the film Smith &quot;reveals&quot; to the lead character where the Catholic Church is wrong on its definite and decisive declarations of faith and morals. Dogma explicitly attacks the perpetual virginity of the Enemy's human mother, the masculine persona of all three persons of the Trinity, and in claiming a &quot;13th Apostle&quot; was edited out of New Testament (for absurdly anachronistic reasons!), attacks the Church as a reliable transmitter of Scripture. Implicitly, Dogma also goes after the one-time-only Incarnation (the Enemy is shown being vulnerable to physical attack because he again assumes a body to play Skee-Ball) and the doctrine of the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ (the &quot;13th Apostle&quot; recalls Jesus as just another charismatic wisdom-teacher).<br /><br />The great contradictions of Dogma seem to reflect the contradictory attitudes writer-director Smith holds against the Catholic Church. Smith, raised a Catholic in our smokescreen-era of utterly-fictional &uuml;ber-liberal &quot;spirit of Vatican 2&quot; clearly resents the Church for  remaining utterly opposed to murder for convenience (abortion and euthanasia) but he also clearly despises shallow, publicity-hungry bishops, as well as bland Masses performed by decidedly &quot;un-fatherly&quot; priests. For us tempters, it is a true delight to hear humans droning in boredom through the Nicene Creed because these contemporary &quot;believers&quot; never once were made aware of the blood of martyrs which testified to each and every tenant of that prayer.<br /><br />Dogma, as to be expected in its pandering to the &quot;spirit of the age&quot;, hits all the expected notes. Anti-abortion protestors are portrayed as imbeciles, Catholic hierarchy in the case of Cardinal Glick (Carlin) as hustling salesmen, and Catholic religious in the case of one nun in full habit, gullible to the most superficial and smarmy atheist &quot;apologetics&quot;.  It's the old method that still works so well; portray those you disagree with as ugly stereotypes and those you agree with as rational, reasonable, and above all, attractive. It worked well for Goebbels and equally so for Smith.  Of course, Smith has his &quot;disclaimer&quot; ready to abandon responsibility, which is something Herr Goebbels had the minimum honesty not to do.<br /><br />Regarding the &quot;spirit of the age&quot;, it is also obvious Smith was much enchanted with neo-Gnostic apologist Elaine Pagels (Smith praises her in the end credits!).  Pagels' words come out as revealed doctrine from the mouthpieces of Rufus the 13th apostle (Rock) and Serendipity the Muse (Hayek). That's another valuable propaganda tactic Smith uses with gusto; your side must always use spokesmen who at least sound reasonable and truthful--and in Dogma's case, show a lot of skin which is apparently some fact verification by human standards. Of course, the &quot;truth&quot; the Catholic Church expresses in Dogma is not only &quot;sexist&quot; it also threatens all of existence--though the latter, only by so ad ignorantum misstating the doctrine of plenary indulgence that even Martin Luther  would be disgusted by Smith's  deliberate misrepresentation.<br /><br />For junior devils who are unfamiliar with the doctrine, plenary indulgences are the Church's allowance for &quot;substitute penances&quot; for sins already confessed and repented for under the Enemy's sacrament of Reconciliation. In other words, if the sin is NOT confessed and NOT repented for, then the sin is NOT absolved no matter how many indulgences  the sinner partakes of--or as in the case of the abuses in the late Middle Ages which Luther quite rightly (even by Catholic standards!) objected to, purchased.Smith's plot device which drives the entirety of Dogma is two &quot;fallen angels&quot; Bartelby (Affleck) and Loki (Damon) will have their disobedience forgiven if they ONLY step through the doors of a certain Church (for which plenary indulgence has been granted by Glick and &quot;approved by the Vatican&quot;), and since that forgiveness will contradict the Enemy's declaration of eternal banishment from Heaven then all of existence will wink out because of the contradiction. Never mind angelic disobedience to the Enemy earns a spirit a firm place in our Father's house and not eternally exile to Wisconsin! Bartelby and Loki only seek entry into Heaven by a &quot;loophole&quot; without a trace of contrition (showing again their fitness for our Father's house) a loophole that is solely of Smith's imagining. No repentance (impossible for a spirit!), no confession, so any indulgence is null and void--which is something these characters would know right from the start.<br /><br />However, these simple facts about indulgences are something most humans, including most Catholics, do not know--hence the effectiveness of Dogma as propaganda because it relies on the disgusting creatures' dependable ignorance. I cannot praise enough our field tempters` particular efforts in sabotaging Catholic catechesis for almost five decades as well as their more general successes in the destruction of history education.<br /><br />Many &quot;cradle Catholics&quot; are ripe fruit to be plucked by such superficial propaganda as Dogma--they are utterly unaware Smith is insulting their intelligence to further an agenda of fornication, sodomy, murder (abortion and euthanasia), and elitist &quot;insider theology&quot;--for after that's what Gnosticism has always been.  A tempter is always on firm ground if he appeals to a human's desire of being among the &quot;enlightened few&quot; -and the deception for us is all that more delightful when the human's snobbery to belong to the &quot;in crowd&quot; actually rests on their abysmal ignorance!  It is always amusing to us devils that the enemies of the Catholic Church frequently accuse her of being &quot;anti-body&quot; and especially &quot;anti-sex&quot; when the demonstrable fact is the Church has always celebrated physical existence as &quot;good&quot; because the Enemy declared it so, and likewise the Church celebrates marital sex, when open to fertility, as being good for the same reason. It was always our-sponsored Gnosticism which attacked physical existence as evil, and procreation especially so.  That tactic could lead humans to a variety of sins under the variety of mutually contradictory expressions of Gnosticism--everything from genital mutilation (re:&quot;Marcion&quot; or &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot;) to sodomy, murder and treason (re: &quot;Albigensian-Catharism&quot;).<br /><br />To conclude, a tempter should aim Dogma at the most susceptible patient; one who his ignorant in his or her faith and already involved with serious sin and seeking ANY justification to keep sinning, no matter how superficial and contradictory.  Using the flippant condescending &quot;humor&quot; of Dogma, a tempter can insulate his patients against the Enemy's most effective and subtle calls to Grace.<br /><br />--Treaclegloch, reviewerRock) and Serendipity the Muse (Hayek).

B008CP6RWU|2.0|My husband loved this game. I thought it was super stupid. I was waiting the whole game for something to start or change. Never did
1442359315|3.0|Frankly, I found this book (which I listened to as an audiobook) to be too well written to be taken as \\"proof\\" of anything. It has the feel of a very well-written novel..a short one, one that got my attention, but not one that provided proof of anything other than a testimony of the author's own supposed experience.<br /><br />I find it too convenient that the author has a website, selling other products, is connected with some other \\"New Age\\" foundation, and is a hot item on the speakers circuit (including Oprah).<br /><br />But even while I have my doubts about this book, it has opened the door for me to think about near death experiences (NDE) more and to perhaps examine some of the literature on the topic.<br /><br />In the mean time, I will return to the writings by and about Orthodox Christian monastics who confront their own mortality on a daily basis and who have very similar profound spiritual experiences.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|One of my fav movies and one of the few I watch over and over. Love the acting...it makes me laugh. Also love the scenes especially the English Cottage. Jude Law and Cameron Diaz rock IMO! Great quality and fantastic price for the dvd.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This artist is easily the best kept secret in America.  Every piece of music is poetry to my ears.  I recently saw this performance on PBS and immediately bought the DVD.  Leonard Cohen takes you to a whole new level and his group of musicians and background singers are top shelf.  I wish that I had known about him many years ago.  Five thumbs up for Leonard Cohen.

B0088WGBC8|4.0|We enjoyed the premise of the movie as well as the movie.  It kept us on the edge of our seats, and the bad guy was hidden for a bit!
0385349947|1.0|I had high hopes for this book but it is mostly puff -- like a long infomercial on all the people she knows, and how fabulously wonderful they are.  The anecdotes are boring because while she has a very wealthy life, she just doesn't have any sorrows or real troubles that make a book worthwhile.
030758836X|2.0|I had heard incredible things about this book and I love a good thriller, so I was excited to finally pick it up. To say that it's a page-turner is an understatement - it definitely kept me up until the a.m. because I simply couldn't put it down! I don't really care if plot twists \\"aren't realistic\\" because it's not a memoir, it's fiction - as long as they're creative, that's good with me. So I loved it, loved it, loved it and couldn't wait to see how it ended - because I knew there was a great twist ending coming - and then boom. No payoff and complete and utter disappointment. I was reading the Kindle version and kept swiping back a few pages hoping it would miraculously change, but no dice. I am viscerally mad! I mean... I guess I can see that certain people would like the ending. It's very...literary and in a way it makes sense. But if you're a thriller lover who expects, after 400+ pages of a teed-up mystery, a great \\"mystery solved\\" payoff... just stay away. Ugh! (In a way, it reminded me a little of the LOST finale... satisfying character conclusion, not a satisfying mystery conclusion. So if you loved the LOST finale, then I'd say go for it, because the rest of the book is great.)
B009AOFNU4|1.0|I have an unlocked gsm iPhone 5. Could not get this thing to work! I got it to pair and that's was all! Total waste of time AND money!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Sting is my favorite singer/artist, so it's no surprise I loved this album. The tunes are a pleasant alternative to traditional Christmas music or covers from other bands. Love it. Great seller.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|But it's a really funny, authentic  movie with the characters from Knocked Up.  The kids are hilarious and it's a good all around flick.
B006UUK1YE|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid. I have ben wanting my son to see it and finally remembered to purchase it for him. Great adventure!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I rented this book for a five day vacation. It was entertaining and easy to finish within that time. Not his best, but worth it if you like John Grisham novels.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Not much of a plot. Clint ought to take a break until something good comes along. This rating process is too cumbersome.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I like playing Quell Reflect. It requires a lot of strategy, but if you keep going you can figure it out.
1619690039|5.0|I like listening to Baldacci's books- I do not expect to be educated by the audio books I listen to, just entertained during drive-time Zero Day did that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest can become addicting (which it has for me).  When I am waiting for my son at his practices, I just log on and the time flies.  I love repinning from other people and just getting different ideas for home, weddings, clothing, etc.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|When I sat down to watch this movie I figured that I was about to watch a pretty funny 'b' horror movie. I was not very accurate. This movie is really good! It has all the usual horror movie elements, young adults on vaca getting killed. From the start this movie takes a really unique twist. The produstion quality is very good, as well as the acting. This is written well also. Seriously, insert big name actor here and this movie is well known. Its funny, scarey and suspenseful. Its funnier every time you watch it.<br />Ok so thats the good. Obviously, as i mentioned, I went into this expecting a B movie. I received something better. I suggest that you take the same approach. I completely mean what I said above, its a very unique horror movie.
B000001G16|5.0|A clearly different album from anything Bon Jovi would produce, this album shows Sambora's artistic, soulful side.  Such a good album.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Great band, great story, great blu-ray.  I highly recommend this for any Rush fan, even if you're not a diehard fan.
B002R02FD6|5.0|This version of the film included both the theatrical and extended versions of the movie, including some very important additional scenes.  This aspect alone makes the product worth it, but the few extras included in the box enhance the experience.
B003XRELGQ|2.0|It never really seemed to make sense to me. Slow read, not sure if it was fiction, fact, a mixture.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its so addicting. I will stay up late at night playing it just to beat my high score or get coins
1568363931|4.0|Nicely done book. Lots of interesting recipes and ideas. A little heavy on hard to find Japanese food items, but they all sound delicious.
B00005AWMF|5.0|This album is so smooth and sexy - love this album. Sade is so timeless. Highly recommend. Also makes a great gift.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I purchased this item in December,2012, because my friend has one and enjoys it a lot.  Here it is the 3rd of April, 2013, and the gears are stripped in my sweeper.  It only has a 90 day warranty.  So I have a nice swivel sweeper that I did like using but now it is broken.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Baldacci is a fabulous storyteller. He is why I bought the book.He did not disappoint me.<br />The double story line was intriguing.
B000I5X81A|4.0|A great album.  Glad I got it.  (Thirteen more words required.  When are they going to pay me for this?)
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Connelly keeps me coming back with his colorful characters and great plots. You can taste LA from the fine Indian food to the canyon crime scenes.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I think this is the best CD yet from my favorite artist.  'Day before we went to war' is my favorite song on the album.  The song variety is great too, with a lot of songs on the album.  It has both the classic Dido rhythms and vocals with some new syles too.  I love it..an easy 5 stars
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game and works exactly the same as the app I used on my smart phone.  The game is user friendly and fun for all ages.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A well crafted story with many different character descriptions intertwined as well as a snapshot of Swedish society.  I read the trilogy and I'm sorry there won't be more like it.
B0095R6OBS|1.0|Scared my daughter, even though she was the one who picked it out.<br />This movie maybe be more fitted to older children, apparently not 7 yr olds.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Very amusing, one of my favorite shows. Rarely a dull episode and still more consistently funny than a lot of other shows.
1439170916|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />This book is well-written and well-researched. It mainly focuses on how treatments for different types of cancer were developed from historical times to the present day. Along the way, the reader gains a greater understanding of what cancer is and how cancer cells go through a process of mutation, selection, and<br /><br />(It seems less expensive to buy this book online - when I checked in Barnes and Noble, it was $18.44 + tax for softcover.)
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Great story. One part you can see coming but there is another good plot twist that caught me by surprise.<br />Makes you glad you live in the USA too.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The app is cool to play with but navagating through it took some time to understand. Lots of moving parts when playing which makes it kind of awkward to play but eventually I got it. As a time waster game (which I usually love) it's ok to play but I got bored of it quickly.
1931955085|5.0|one of the most interesting books I have ever purchased. I love how odd and beautiful it is. Holly Meyers, this book is excellent and I have it on my coffee table for everyone to view!
0061124958|5.0|I loved that this book was in excellent condition and hard back. It arrived in a timely manner & being hard back it will last longer in my classroom library.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|&#34;Lean In&#34; deserves every one of its five stars. I pre-ordered the book on my Kindle and was delighted when I saw it pop up on my home page because I find Sheryl Sandberg incredibly inspiring and insightful. As a working mother and a woman who values both success and living a significant, fulfilling life, Lean In really resonated with me. The book delivers so many gems, for example, discarding the idea of a career ladder and looking at a jungle gym instead because there are more ways to the top and requires a more diverse set of skills. I could also relate to the issue Sandberg raises about women who are kind in the work place being thought to be less competent, and her insights into what it really means to be part of an equal partnership in marriage was something my husband and me discussed late into the night. Every young woman embarking on a working life and, really, every woman should read this book. Sandberg has, in writing it, reignited the discussion around feminism and equality in work and life. A good, solid, intelligent read!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Awesome<br />Nothing else to be said definitely better then the movie must read very addictive you will not stop reading until the end.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|New issue it says you need to update to sign in yet i dont know how to update it.<br />Please help someone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved the book. I read it in three days I couldn't stop reading. I can't wait for the next one.great author.
B003L77G8I|5.0|i chose this dvd series becuase im really into those crime shows. my favorite of it so far is the creative ness in the different crime scenes and i would recommend this dvd to anyone interested in crime shows
B001F6ZIXW|2.0|I'm sorry, this is not my cup of tea. Bikers with a drug business who like to kill and burn up people. The Brad Pitt-lookalike character is eye-candy, but not enough to carry the whole series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yes you can believe all the hype you have heard about this show, it is great.  I'm generally not a zombie fan but this show is about much more than just zombies.
B0012GMW7A|4.0|New to Leonard Cohen. This is an enjoyable album, excellent recording quality. His stuff is a bit dark so it can get wearying after a while, though.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|This book gives you a very honest and insightful look into modeling and acting careers, and what they have to give up to stay in the business. It helps you understand the struggles of those who have eating disorders. Anyone with an addiction will be able to relate to it. It also helps anyone who has ever felt like they weren't good enough, and had to be something different to fit in or to please others. I think most people can relate to this, if they are honest. This book helps you understand that people can overcome obstacles, and live happy, productive lives. Anyone can benefit from reading it. My applause to the author for being so honest!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I don't think pocket is bad, but seriously! 7 bucks gone for a glitcthy, old, version of minecraft. I would rather pay $27 for the computer version, which I have. If you want the real, new, and fixed version of minecraft, buy the pc version!!!
B00006JSS8|4.0|One of the songs towards the end of the CD skipped but I didn't feel it was worth returning it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love the accounts of this book. Factual as well as entertaining. It was riveting. I couldn't put the book down!
0670026603|5.0|To my discredit, I tend to write a review when I hate a book since I'm resenting the time I wasted. The good ones I accept and move on. This time I am compelled to write. Not only was ME BEFORE YOU a fabulous read (easy, moved along, likeable and interesting characters) but it was almost unbearably moving. I pictured Will as something like Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey. Some of his lines just stopped me in my tracks they were so intense, spot on, and beautifully anguished.  I felt his desperation and devastation at not being who he was and needed to be again. I fell in love with both Will and Louisa. I am a lawyer and a writer and am humbled by JoJo Moyes' book. This book will remain with me forever and was an experience that has actually changed parts of me. I adored it and take my hat off to Ms. Moyes. In my opinion, a masterpiece and I'm not exaggerating.
B0023P1D8S|5.0|This is a great version of the original album.  I really like the bonus CD that comes with it.  I'm a huge Sabbath fan, and this is a great version of the Masters album.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|It has been a VERY long time since I've been this amped about a band.  The Script is lyrically intelligent and emotionally driven.  Their sound is genuine on all 3 albums.  I cannot even pick a favorite since they are all great.  Their third album, #3, is amazing.  So much so that I bought the delux version just to get \\"Hurricanes\\".  I had the pleasure of seeing them perform live this past fall and if I wasn't hooked before, I certainly was following the concert.  They sound exactly the same live as they do on their albums...a true sign of real talent...not this manufactured crap that is all over pop radio these days.  If you liked either of their two previous albums, you'll love #3!!!  The Script is nearly all I listen to these days...so much so that I think my husband is getting sick of them.  Favorite tracks from #3 are probably, \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" and \\"Millionaires\\", although truly, I love them all.  Can't wait for another US tour and a 4th album!!!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I've always loved this tragic and sad movie, but beautifully made. No others black & white movie can or will ever top Schindler's List.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is great I have never read a book that states everything so clearly. It is truly an amazing book
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Freakishly real, destroying the world doesn't bother me, is how quick you can do it!  Spread, then kill!! For $ .99, it's worth it!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I've already written and submitted a review of the movie. A good movie, not a great movie, somewhat jumbled in its message.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Motorola Xoom Tablet<br /><br />I went looking for a monogram app, and was not impressed with the others.  Cross Me and Cross Me Color look better on the tablet, the controls are intuitive and responsive.  There are probably five times as many puzzles in this game as most others, so the price is reasonable.  I would like to see the X get its own button along with the other colors.  Not changing the current scheme, just add an X.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the 3-D edition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this season and the convenience of the Amazon Instant Video. We couldn't find this season on Hulu or Netflix, and it's so nice to be able to watch on our PS3 and not just the computer.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Lots of adventure and bright colors are appealing to kids. Would recommend it for children. fast action and fun  terrain.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun and a great game it sometimes freezes but very rarely and it is super fun also easy!  I recommend this app
B004H51706|1.0|We bought this for our 8 year old son.  It looks great and he loved it when received.  However, the back spare tire broke off after less than one week.  Bruder said they would replace the tire and back door, but after more than two months and several emails they have not done so.  Since the toy broke our son doesn't play with it and was very disappointed.<br /><br />I would NOT buy a Bruder toy again ... just my opinion.
B0016MJ6T2|5.0|Great movie love the actors.  Always loved Seth and Macaulay.  Watching this movie always makes me think I should be more adventurous in my life.  There is always time to change I guess.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love Subway Surfers Sydney! But the point counter takes a long time to count a lot longer than Rome. It is a great.game for people.of all ages
B003GIW8JE|5.0|Back then I thought it was &#34;hard rock&#34;... not, but wow what a memory maker.  This was the music that caused my hearing to go bad!  If I had it to do over again I would still play it all out!
0765325950|4.0|Ok, so its not the best book in thes eries, but at least we have resolution to the series. I would read a sequel should it ever be considered.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|I didn't think I'd like this film when it was advertized on TV. Didn't like the idea of such a disabled man having sex. But after buying & watching the film I was touched. Great acting & story. Glad I bought it.
1449433251|5.0|Oh nostalgia...
B002BWP49C|5.0|I just love this series. It is well written almost verbatim to the book and the scenes with the wolves seems as if you could actually touch them. Great film
1932100385|5.0|A very good informative book on our country and what is known about what food we eat,so sad !! I recommend this book to my friends
B002NXSRVG|5.0|Loved this movie. Full of action and the story is not so bad either. I have watched it multiple times and never  get tired of it
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The writing and performances continue to make this one of the greatest series in the history of cable television...or TV period.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|wow awesome show!! great packaging ,I love the seasons are all put together in thier own lil slot and the bonus dvd is just great :)
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I had to 'nag' my wife to watch this series, now SHE'S hooked!  The story line alone warrants watching it.  The 'zombies' AREN'T the subject but the catalyst which motivates the complex and believable characters to learn to give-in & die or survive in a world that is being nauseatingly destroyed and has started-from-scratch.  One of the best 'series' ever made... Rob Reiner was right when he said, &#34;With series' such as this, we HAVE entered a second &#34;Golden Age of Television&#34;...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show was watched by my wife she found th first season on Netflix and loved it. She was disappointed that was all they had. Then we found it on here, oh happy day.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just like all of his books, this pulls you in. I couldn't put it down and I'm reading it for the third time! Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a love story, with a twist. 😍😏
B0039TAHMA|4.0|This was a very entertaining firm but I wish it had subtitles. We were not able to understand some of the dialogue and this would have been helpful.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My son played it on the computer all the time and i was surprised that he loves this board game as well. He was playing it all over and over.
B00005K483|1.0|According to Eforcity you are getting a \\"real\\" Canon lens hood.  They even say \\"by Canon\\" on there page. Sorry to say you are getting a cheap imitation hood.  Built nothing like ones you would get made by Canon and it comes in a white generic box that says \\"Made in China\\".  If you were getting a real Canon hood it would come in a real Canon box and more then likely it would be made in Japan.  I have other Canon lens hoods and this one doesn't even come close to the quality of a real Canon hood.  All I can say is BUYER BEWARE!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best in the world I love it.<br />It is so addicting.<br />I have told everyone I now about it.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Not as good as I had hoped, but it did have some entertainment value. The animation was very good though.
B008D36INE|3.0|This is a terrific movie to watch if you like good performances, but the story itself is cheerless and depressing.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie, even when you pretty much know the ending! Definitely worth the Oscar it won. Ben Affleck was great, as were the other cast members portraying what must have truly been terrifying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely adore this game.I have spent hours on it.Subway Surfer is one of my all time favourites and I can not think of any one word to describe this game it's just that amazing.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love all the characters. They are just great!!. But best the imp and Arya. And definetely will recommend this book.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I just got the game and enjoy the challenge.<br />Took little time to accomplish it now have to realize the strategy.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Great album, not disappointed with this purchase. Would buy it again.  Well put- together album with different vibes to each song,  that keep the listener interested.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|What could I possibly say about this album that hasn't already been said? I just wanted to be able to listen to this on my Fire.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have heard a lot of people talk about Pinterest and had to give it a try.  Now I know why people love it :)
B006FE83UE|5.0|I bought this movie after reading the book with my 8th grade class. The whole sense of the book is seen in the movie, but the book is still better. I can't believe the movie came out so soon after the book was published.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very awesome gcrrvycv f f gg. cfcas d. c d. d x xd. x xXx. xxxxddddsssdxxxss xdx. sss s s s. xbs sg.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I randomly picked this book from other books to read on vacation. This book was beyond all expectations as an historical, fiction account of orphan train that I knew nothing about until I read this book. It is a truly gripping story.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|I've been a Beard fan since Kindness of Strangers, went back and got the older albums, stayed on until Snow.  Stuff W/o Neal is not my cuppa.  Hearing that Ted Leonard of Enchant was going to sing with the Beard gave me great hope as I'm a giant fan of Enchant.  Yes, Ted doesn't sound like Neal, but these guys didn't make the wrong choice.  This CD is excellent out of the gate and will continue to get better over time.  I'm really pumped to hear Ted take on older stuff in a live context as I've not heard it yet.  Do yourself a favor and get the double CD as there are no throw away tracks on disc 2.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Beard with Neal, but not so much with Nick on vocals, don't despair and check this disc out.  It must be said that Dave on bass sounds fantastic and Alan and Ryo are all in top top form.  Well done indeed!
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I needed it to see roaming signal strength around the office and found that it worked great.  I took away a star because it's a bit slow to refresh.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I've read all of th  diary of a wimpy kid books and this one was by far the best! I reall hope Jeff Kinney comes up with another book.because i will be shore to buy it!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book, would recommend to anyone!<br />I was hooked from the very first chapter and read it very quickly.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I've had the new album for almost 48 hours and I am hopelessly in love with NKOTB all over again. The last album \\"The Block \\" was great and I really enjoy this one. Yes there are more dance songs but that's just what I like. I think they are known for the songs that get you dancing. I'm looking forward to seeing them for the 3rd time on tour since they reunited. My favorite songs are whisper, remix and crash.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I love Rodriguez~I want to hear all of Rodriguez songs and I hope he does more, SOON I really really hope he does more songs~!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a awesome app hope there's more to come<br />I love the cute pets I especially love the dancing horse there so cute
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series I have watched in a long time. I really like the fact that it seems true to the time it takes place. As for the streaming, I think it cut off before it quite reached the end.  I suddenly got a message box that said 'loading', but it never came back on.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|My husband and I started this a month ago and have found it incredibly easy to follow and since each of us has lost 10 lbs, it seems to work for us.  We did South Beach a number of years ago with good results, but it is much more time consuming if done correctly.  We were thinking of doing a couple of weeks of South Beach again when we saw a review of this book in the NYT and decided to give it a try.  We love food and love to cook, but with very little thought, this is a win.  Our current favorite breakfast option for this diet is a frittata made with zucchini and non-fat cheese - filling but also filled with flavor.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|just started watching and can't stop.  The character development and storyline is amazing.  Bastards, whores and dwarves- gratuitous nudity and excessive violence- oh and dragons.  and zombies.  this show has everything.
0143036742|5.0|Being Ukrainian myself, I can so identify with this story. This was my first Lewycka book and I liked it so much that I ordered all her other books as well.
B00AYHK7RU|5.0|Bowie comes back with a bang, from top to bottom this album is fantastic, his best since the early 1980s. \\"Heathen\\" and \\"Reality\\" are both solid albums, but \\"The Next Day\\" can easily make its way into the Top 5 Bowie albums for many fans, a great accomplishment for someone who has been making music this long. You've got songs that are mellow, songs that are loud rockers, and of course some that might make you want to get up and move.<br /><br />This should definitely be nominated for Best Rock Album at the Grammy's, and maybe Album of the Year. We'll have to wait and see.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I expected to be able to find people, look for jobs, etc.  Instead we get some weird thing that barely has four functions. Very disappointed.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|The base and electric guitars were too brash. I like this kind<br />of music (Jimmy Hendricks), but on some CDs they over hype<br />the highs.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My kids love it because it's cutesy and goofy. My wife and I like it because you don't have to be a total gamer to get the jokes (but my brother, gamer to the core, likes it because there are apparently a plethora of in-jokes as well) and it's a fun flick. Great voice acting.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This story turned out to be really good and I just bought the next book. Now I know a lot of people out there are all hung up on the Spelling and Grammar of some of the new writers coming out. BUT, I don't care! I'm in it for the story!<br />This was a really compelling story for a new writer. It’s your basic good vs. evil but once I got into it I couldn’t stop reading it! What I really like about his writing is that he found the right balance to build up his characters and his world without being all “Word Smithy”. He was able to get his story across to me and I was able sit back and enjoy.<br />This whole series has me hooked! The author has laid out his whole world and his characters are well and balanced, in my opinion! It's your god vs. evil story line but I found that the characters took on their own personalities and that I would have the ups and downs, when they did or didn't do something. I also just couldn't stop reading and I lost a lot of sleep time over this series and can't wait for the next one to come out.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Dwarves, elves, hobbit(s), wizards, goblins, orcs, wargs-dude, this movie is badass and we all know it. It looks great and is a good lead-in to the rest of the story.
1451613512|3.0|I must say that just reading the contents page screamed the agenda.  Every Republicans Administrations \\"Death Squads\\" and \\"Gates of Hell\\" followed up by Obamas \\"Managing a Wounded Empire\\".  I mean come on just tell it as you see it.  I'm still gonna read, I just hope I dont ruin the pages with laughter or spew.
B0058A119G|5.0|Outstanding choice to have in BS collection.  Excellent condition...prompt shipping.  Happy to have this enjoyable CD.  Enjoyable opportunity all the way 'round!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great show if you like action, plot twists, and real life situations. This show is the blueprint for shows like Southland and any other LA crime TV.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is the moba style game that I have been looking for. After the recent update it just got better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is excellent drama that kind of reminds me of a Little House on the Prairie with its adherence to the old world morals of days gone by. Check it out!
B000W93CHC|4.0|...but unfortunately so much like his Pillars of the Earth that you will wonder how many more books can be cloned from this formula. Still, a satisfying read.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Good game and I enjoy it.  easy to forget how long you have been playing it. challenging and keeps you thinking
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The first half was just as slow reading as all of book #4.  In the second half, the idle talk turned into to stratagems, battles, and some things that are too grotesque to rewrite, yet put the spark back into the series as the first three books did.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I really enjoyed the series and wish there were more shows to see.  The group of actors made it such a fun time.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I love the Godfather collection, and needed to replace my video set with a DVD set, so this was a perfect purchase for me.  The quality of the DVDs is excellent, and I loved the additional interviews on the extra disc.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I have to state that I was hesitant to see this movie but after reading so many positive reviews I took a chance and bought it. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and now I wish I had seen it on the big screen. The music score was fun and catchy. The performances were powerful and I must say, Anna Kendrick WOWED me. This girl can look so shabby and then transforms into a completely gorgeous woman. After seeing her in this film I must say she has the rare gift of wowing a person like Marilyn Monroe had in the 50's. I look forward to seeing this girl shoot to stardom and become a big headliner. Now her counter part Skylar Astin talk about adorable and talented. This guy played his part with such flare. I have never heard of him before but I totally respect him as an actor now. His facial expressions say 1000 words. I felt his pain and his happiness and Rebel Wilson, where did you come from? You are fun and hysterical, she is definitely a comedic actress. I wouldn't give this movie a 5 star as it isn't in my top 10 favorite movies but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it and gave it a 4 star rating and that's damn good! A must see for fans of good music and amazing talent.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|The additional information made the movies stand out even more than the first time I saw them. The 'how we made this' sequences were extremely interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome. Just so awesome. Although I'm GOOD at temple run, I am REALLY GOOD at subway surfers. It is fun and very addictive. I play it all the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ive been playing it 8 hours. Straight! Litterly! I think its an amazing game and is gonnna get far in the app buisness.  Great work subway surfurs!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game I have ever played before. Try to make the updates more common and try to make one of the updates Texas.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|I like this CD set.  It's a good collection of Garth Brooks hits.  My only disappointment is that I had to buy the CDs at all.  I'd have preferred downloading it digitally.
0316077046|5.0|this is such a great series i love the books alot its so good Ethan & Lena = love forever :)
8498380138|5.0|In English:<br />I am currently studying Spanish and reading a book like this is great because the story is so enjoyable that it feels like fun, not studying.<br /><br />En espa&ntilde;ol:<br />Soy estudiante de espa&ntilde;ol y me gusta leer los libros como este porque la historia es divertida y interesante a diferencia a los libros de texto tradicionales.
0345803493|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars.  Good story line both romanic and suspense.  I recommend this book to all adult readers.
B0054JELS4|5.0|This was the perfect gift for someone hard to buy for. He was very happy with the set! I received the package very fast for a time sensitive gift!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Because I watch All the episodes.<br /><br />I liked the mini games. But I did not like how it takes long to build the homes and how you have to have gems to skip quests and house building.<br />Everybody!<br /><br />Emily Patenaude Age 9
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia has so many interesting things about the history of The Legend of Zelda franchise. Right now, it's now 27 years since The Legend of Zelda has been around. This review will contain my continuous support for both Nintendo and this fantastic franchise.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Wow--what a touching, stick with you movie--that's also incredibly funny!  My husband rolled his eyes when I saw it on Amazon and clicked the buy button because I remembered someone told me several months ago that this was their new favorite movie.<br />But by the end of the 2 hours, he loved it as much as I did.<br />Highly highly recommend!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Although a sad and unfortunate story, Denzel Washington did some great acting.  The story line was well portrayed.<br />I recommend it!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|As was the actor who played the guy in the iron lung.  This was a really good movie--it made me cry, which is saying a lot these days.  It has a similar theme to the Intouchables...  and both are also true stories.<br /><br />Bravo for Helen Hunt's body, too.  The bedroom scenes had to have that nudity and she really pulled it off.  Literally.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hope /Sky is one tough cookie. Somehow I understand her even though we don't share the same experiences. I wish everyone had amDean Holder on their side to help them through the tough times. I loved seeing their love develop and grow.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|We watched this before we knew about the Oscar nominations.  It was so good...  I didn't want it to end.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Pretty accurate to the book series but better! Who needs stinking words when you can watch the story, enjoy the slaughter and a little T & A never hurts!
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|the fourth boss changes your units to theirs... well I spent all my money on improving one really good udnit to wipe out the enemies and now I cant get past wave 40. the boss isn't even a one time deal so I don't want to put myself through the torture of trying to get any further. its a good game up until wave 40. if you people are fine with a steep increase in difficulty then you can keep playing, but I just cant do it. everything up 40 is really good which is why I'm being generous with 3 stars.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a great fan of Stephen King novels and this one did not disappoint!  I would definitely recommend it.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Fine dining is one of my greatest pleasures in life and had even toyed with the fantasy of running a restaurant of my own.  After reading this book, I saw how much work would be involved and realized I wouldn't have the stamina, let alone the passion that would be required to make the establishment a success.  Bourdain clearly does have the passion, and it came through on every page.  The book lived up to its well-deserved reputation.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Supremely written and completely engaging.<br />From the first page to the last I was hooked. Very easy to relative to as a father of boys...scary.<br />A very worth while book that I highly recommend
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Get the book. It's a fun read. I wish she talk more of things that happened on SNL. ESp. Betty White.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Let's face it. Preludes typically suck. I assumed that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was going to be just another failed attempt at a prelude. Thankfully, I was wrong!<br /><br />Sometimes when glancing at negative reviews, I feel that many have not even watched the movie which they are reviewing. In the case of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the naysayer \\"reviews\\" tend to follow the same theme as what I felt the first time I saw the preview. However, I will not judge a movie without first seeing it. In most cases, my initial instincts are right. That is not the case with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. That fact alone makes me wonder how many of the \\"1 Star\\" reviewers have actually watched it and how many of them are just writing reviews based on their \\"initial feelings\\".<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey serves as a prelude to the breathtaking LOTR trilogy. Since the events of this story are set before those of LOTR, the theme is of a more peaceful Middle-Earth. That doesn't mean that darkness isn't spread throughout the land. It's just well hidden from the normal flow. Since you know what's coming, it makes you want to jump into the screen and slap some of them!<br /><br />* Sir Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman return to play the roles of Gandalf the Grey and Bilbo Baggins. Both give remarkable performances.<br />* The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey shows a deeper look into the Dwarfs, which I find adds to the LOTR trilogy. In fact, I felt compelled to revisit those movies after seeing The Hobbit.<br />* The graphics soared above all of my expectations.<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was a very small book. The writers did an outstanding job of supplementing the short story with other looks into Tolkien's other worlds.<br /><br />Like so many others, the amount of criticism from negative reviewers forced me to believe that this would be just another failed Hollywood attempt at a prelude. \\"I've never been so wrong in all my life.\\"I would recommend that all fans of the original trilogy watch The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Free so you can't beat that, ads are not too bad, customizable deck is cool, auto finish also cool and one tap to move. If you like solitary, get it!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This season was just as good as Season 1.  The actors are great as is the storyline.  I know many people who watch this faithfully.
B008RYN44U|5.0|Why has this album only sold 240,000 copies in the U.S.?  No promoting.  I didn't even know No Doubt was back and with a new CD until I heard a clip of Push & Shove while playing SongPop on Facebook!  For $10 w/ free InstantRip, I figured &#34;why not&#34;.  My wife and I actually enjoy this album quite a bit.  The songs are a little more pop than previous No Doubt, but still good just the same and Gwen sounds as good as ever.  Like No Doubt?  Don't like No Doubt and have $10 burning a hole in your pocket?  But this album.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great evocation, with Spielberg at the helm and Daniel Day-Lewis BEING Abraham Lincoln (after a while, you'll come to accept he IS the eponymous lead character of the movie!), a &#34;slice-of-life&#34; look into an important period in our nation's history...of the times and historical period, and that moment in President Lincoln's life, and in the life of our country--a momentous historical time, shown with clarity and understanding and drama--takes what could've been a dry and boring film for some (and let's face it, not all viewers love movies with rather dry historical references and political infighting) and produces a winner.  A caveat--not for those movie-goers who like fluff (comedies, and/or romantic sugar-films)--this is a heavy (you're gonna have to think while watching) but thoroughly enjoyable and great American film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun and entertaining. It is a great time killer. But once you start playing you won't wanna stop.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Marvel's Avengers is a movie based on the comic book the Ultimate Avenger. It brings a cast both well known to and a few less popular. Robert Downey Jr. reprising his role as Tony Stark a.k.a. Ironman, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, Chris Hemsworth  as the Mighty Thor, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner a.k.a. The Hulk, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton a.k.a. Hawkeye. It also has appearances by actress Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Voice of Paul Bettany for Jarvis, Tom Hiddleton as Loki, and Clark Gregg as Phil a.k.a. Agent Coulson. It was a very well put together cast. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon the creator of t.v. shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly.<br /> The movie is about Loki the adopted brother of Thor, try to take over the planet just to make his brother suffer.  Loki needed  the tesseract to let his army arrive on Earth. Earth is by far out matched by the alien threat. The division of the government known as S.H.I.E.L.D. brings Earths most powerful heroes together to fight the looming threat. Will the heroes save the planet or will they fail and the people of the Earth become slaves to the lunatic Loki.<br /> Joss Whedon put a well rounded cast together for this movie. I was a little worried with the actor he replaced Edward Norton with Mark Ruffalo, but Ruffalo did a tremendous job as Bruce banner. Joss Whedon was able to get the same actors as the rest of the heroes and the villain of the movie. I felt that Robert Downey Jr. was the best choice for Tony Stark from the very first Ironman, he pulls off the character flawlessly again. Chris Hemsworth returns as probably my favorite hero of the group, where he pulls off Marvel's depiction of the Norse God of Thunder. For me, I couldn't see Chris Evans playing a serious role like Steve Rogers was a good idea, but he proved to me that he is an extremely good actor. Nowfor Sam Jackson, when isn't he one of the baddest characters in the movie. All the other heroes was portrayed more than properly. Tom Hiddleton brought life to the villain that is smooth, yet causing chaos for the Heroes. I thought the actors chosen added to the movie.<br /> Overall  I thought the movie was very well put together. the story was everything a comic book movie should be for both long time fans, and the new audience member of the franchise. The writing was funny at moments serious when it needed at others, both in the script and in the action. Overall I give the movie a 5 out of 5, well worth the money to see.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|very reminiscent of the giver- just the love story version of it really<br />i say 4 now but that could change depending on the rest of the books in the series.  i don't like the ending of this, but maybe the other books will make it all okay
B009KY0TE4|5.0|You must won this wonderful Adele masterpiece! It is incredible.. Her voice as always is beautiful with an edge. Buy it now.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I don't know how people could not like the ending of this show, I give it credit because it does something that virtually no show does these days - END. This show knows how far it intended on going and even though over the course of the show the ratings just got higher it still decided that they would finish on a high note. This is a show that is amazing from beginning to end so if you are reading through all of the other reviews trying to decide whether to buy it just buy the show, you will not be disappointed!
1476734941|4.0|I do not need to lose weight but perhaps that is because I always pay attention to what I eat and exercise.  So some people would think it is odd for me to read a diet book.<br /><br />I tried this diet for 4 weeks so far and will likely make this a lifetime habit.  I only do low calorie one day per week - not the 2 they suggested.  It is no problem at all to stick to as long as I plan to do the real low calorie days when I am not eating out or with other people.<br /><br />2 tricks that have helped me stick to this.  I combine it with the parsley diet (because I like parsley and grow it in abundance).  I also make a pot of thin soup.  Just cut up vegetables (celery, lettuce, spinach, carrot (not plural), onion, leeks etc.  Easy to calculate the calories.  I find the broth and soup helps curb the hunger.<br /><br />I do notice higher irritation on the \\"fast\\" days.  And sometimes, I get a slight headache.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is really addictive! I can't stop playing it. It's fun and it teaches you responsibility and American history at the same time!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Received faster than expected, was a little pricey but that's because this item is not in circulation so it was expected. But very happy with it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Suspenseful. This book was a good read. It was a pretty quick read, but it had me hooked and I couldn't put it down.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am a Mahjong fanatic, so really zipped right through all levels of this.  really enjoyed each level, so will you.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Overpriced for the game I received.  Would not recommend. The game was challenging. Enough. But the free was lots better to play.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|This release is retro but still so current. Addicted to Electric EEl right now and developing new favorites. Satisfied w/purchase
1881273873|5.0|Very good information for anyone who doesn't live on a desert island. Excellent for dating couples, but also applicable to other relationships.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I've read 5 in a row.  Need to research more about Norway.  Book's description of the seasons reminds me very much of where I currently live.  I think I'd feel right at home there.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|he plays the game alot it is a  good learning aide we played it together tried to trick him but he knows better
B00A525OHM|5.0|I already had season 4, I got this for the Paley Festival. Only thing that would have made this better(& it was really good) was if it was captioned. I'm hard of hearing,& it would have been really fun to catch the asides that I knew(but didn't hear) thrown around.I love this show, & I felt a little left out, didn't catch the inside joke. I loved what I did hear & saw, though, like Tamala explaining to Jon the difference between kissing him & Nathan. It's a really good reason to go the distance if you're a true Castle fan.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Too much time wasted waiting for loading and inadequate instructions.for playing the game,if any.  In addition, there is too much time spent for juvinile ads.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is just a very cool game and I like it a lot because umm it's just a really cool game[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty is a rather intense movie.  I did not know what to expect to see some of the things that I did in that movie.  It was really interesting to see the tactics that the people used.  Through some parts of this movie it was a little boring.  Other than that, this movie is a great one to see to try and understand how long of a process it was to try and catch Osama Bin Laden.  I understand that this was never going to be an easy proves for American citizens.  However, the lead actress never did give up on what she believed in.  I enjoyed watching how aggressive the lead actress was.  She was never going to take no for an answer.  Some of this movie also seemed pretty gruesome.  There was a lot of action and a lot of killing.  But what is there to expect when they are filming a movie over in Afghanistan, all that necessarily happens is murder.  The movie depicts a real situation overseas.  I got the feeling like I sort of knew what was going on.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in viewing the history of the death of Osama Bin Laden.  It is fascinating.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is really addicting! I couldn't put it down. One of my Best friends recommended this series to me. He said they were exciting and they are. I would recommend this book to every one who enjoys a little fiction story about friendships and adventure. I feel like a part of the story when I read these books. My favorite part about these books is that I relate to them as a teenage girl. All and all great book, scratch that, great series!
B009RWPAA2|1.0|Great album but NOT the limited LP version as described in the product description. A very good album anyway, worth having in your collection.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|A simple story with a stellar cast.  Some may find it dated, but the story and the acting are great.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this app its fun but there should be more ways to get coins. it is a pretty cool game
B006WXHJNU|5.0|A great entry into the Marvel movie universe!  Edward Norton plays the role excellently and I really prefer him over Mark Ruffalo.  Both are good characters but very different.  The whole reason I bought the Blu-ray was for the soundtrack.  I had heard that the DTS-HD was superb and a great way to show off my surround sound system and new subwoofer.  While not quite as perfect demo material as War of the Worlds, there are still quite a few excellent scenes that make perfect use of the LFE track.<br /><br />If you're a collector of the Marvel movies, there's no disappointment here.  The transfer is solid and the soundtrack is the real selling point for the Blu-ray, in my opinion.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I had to order this delightful movie because my family loves it!  I  would Highly recommend this movie. Your whole family will love it!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Simply put, Rothfuss is  poetic, romantic, beautiful and damn near perfect. And the Magic & Science of his world is so well developed I hated to put down the kindlmmmp ok
B009D7CP2M|4.0|This one had been on my \\"to read\\" list for a long time, but the subject matter was so distasteful, I was putting off reading it.  After the events in Newtown in December, I felt compelled to read it as my \\"first book of 2013\\".  First, let me say that none, and I mean none of the characters in this book is very sympathetic until nearly the very end.  And though I feel guilty about saying it, even the victims come off as remarkably unsympathetic.<br /><br />In this socially and politically relevant book, Shriver explores the difficult topic of parenting, bullies at school, and ultimately the violence that a perfect storm of events can lead us to living.  The mom in this book is a highly successful woman with a company of her own, two children, and no real connections with anyone in her life.  Told from her point of view, we are led through a dramatic and violent incident in a painstaking manner.  As difficult as this was to read, can you even imagine what it would be like to live this life?  A completely unexpected turn of events towards the end left me breathless (no spoilers).  Insert a fully body shudder here.<br /><br />Remarkably, near the very end of the novel after her son has wreaked unspeakable violence and the narrator has lost nearly everything, I found it poignant that she has deliberately moved to living quarters that will accommodate her son once he's released from juvenile detention.  A room awaits him, and she seems finally able to give him the love and comfort she was unable to provide prior to the heinous crimes he's committed.<br /><br />This is a difficult and challenging read, but to even begin to understand the times in which we live, I think it is an important one.  It was well worth the time and the uncomfortable moments it caused.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Now I know why the deleted scenes weren;t in the original release. Putting them back in made for a more complete and satisfing film for me. As a fan of the books and films it made me wish that this had been done in other Twilight films - especially New Moon and Eclipse.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Cosmere, the universe that Brandon's adult novels exist in. But I love his novels even without that part. Each world is so unique yet so vivid and alive. Finishing one is saddening since I know it's one less book to live in.<br /><br />Way of Kings, thankfully, is the first of ten. It's a bit overwhelming, especially at first but the book never holds your hand which makes it all the better once you get used to the world. It really feels real.<br /><br />There's so much to say about this book but I think you should just give it a try.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels star is very addictive.  Fun, but very challenging.  Some levels can be quite hard to get past.  A great game for just passing time.
B00993I6D2|4.0|I think anyone who hasn't read the book should see this movie. I think Orwell had the ability to see 2013 and beyond
B00BESCJII|5.0|One of the best films this year .  Warm and touching.  Loved it!  Recommend this for everyone of all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is better than any aneroid game ever I have never ecperienced it before like this thank you for the game****★***
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|I am a fan of the show and since I do not have cable I have been watching the show on my smartphone. The second season was unforgettable. The third was outrageous. It is a great show. Plus the new characters are scarier then the walkers themselves. Power and control can make anyone crazy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When my friends told me about it I wasn't very impressed and I thought that it would be one those games where u regret buying it but with this game it is not like one of those games. It is so fun and if u buy this game I guarantee you'll love 100%.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the greatest. Kids love it great family game....its just a great game i dont know what eles to say besides its addicting lol
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. it was full of suspense and I really liked the plot. It was a great story full of love and hope.
B000T433CO|5.0|The picture was heartfelt.  Funny at times and down to earth and sentimental too.  I just enjoyed everything about it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I liked the app but I wasn't crazy about it. It's fun but not for everyone. To make it better, they should use a setup like the app &quot;My Town 2&quot;. That app uses real places throughout the world. Even from smaller cities like Cleveland and Buffalo
0316228532|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book.  I read until the end, waiting to actually care about ANY of the characters, and it never happened.  A depressing tale of English small town politics, with a depressing cast of characters who engage in all sorts of bad behavior.  I did give two stars rather than only one, because it was well written and edited.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I love the price that I got for the CD, I have wanted it since the day it came out. (I know that was a long time ago) One Direction is my favorite band, and I love the CD. I am very satisfied.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Opeth albums. It doesn't seem to be as well known as some of their later work, but ought to be.<br /><br />Still Life is a single comprehensive work of art, a concept album in good progressive rock tradition. It manages this despite covering a wide variety of styles, from jazz and blues to death metal.
B00000E2WH|3.0|Von Karajan is a great Sibelius conductor, and his mid-1960's recordings of the later symphonies should never be absent from the catalogue.  But the 1984 recording of the tone poems on this disc is unsatisfactory: the digital sound is blaring, and the balance seems wrong (most noticeable in \\"The Swan of Tuonela\\"  where the relation of the cor anglais to the orchestra can be judged).  Karajan's earlier recordings of the \\"Tapiola\\" and \\"The Swan\\" are better heard in the mid-60's analogue versions that accompany the 2-disc DG set that includes Symphonies 4-7.  Better still, and focussed completely on tone-poems and shorter pieces, is Colin Davis's early 1990's recording that doesn't have \\"The Swan\\" but does have \\"Tapiola,\\" the \\"Karelia\\" suite,\\" Valse Triste,\\" and \\"Finlandia,\\" as well as a couple of others in sound that is not at all claustrophobic and an orchestral picture that is better balanced.  I don't think that Karajan's conception of the music is the problem on the disc under review -- I think it's the sound pure and simple.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game, it's challenging and i think my grandsons are going to love it also. i just got it and like other reveiws it is addicting. it is fun each time to see if i can go further than the last time (i die pretty fast, still getting the hang of the game)having to jump and tilt keeps you on your toes. i would recommend this game to everyone.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Enjoyed the book and the overall story. Not 5 stars as I don't think it is a &#34;great work of literature&#34;. however perfect book for a rainy Sunday....
1451620829|5.0|A very honest and great book! Spends a little too much time on his childhood, and not enough time on making the records. I guess thats my only real complaint. Very well written. As a drummer it would have been nice to get more imput on his drum kits and the recording stories. But all in all a very honest great great book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|When Game of Thrones Season 3 began to be advertised, I started reading the first three books of the season, because I wanted to better understand what was happening on the screen.  The twists and turns in George R. R. Martin's story are difficult to take sometimes:  No character is safe, what happens to them is not foreordained, at least not as one would expect, and I was at the edge of my seat, wanting to know what the next mishap or even good fortune would be.  The Epilogue took me absolutely by surprise, so now I am embarking on Book 4.<br /><br />If you loved Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and all the fantasy/adventure books that have been published, you must read the five books of theSong of Ice and Fire.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I received my product before the estimated arrival date. The prices of their DVDs are very competitive to others. I would recommend this company to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this app is a good app for when you are sleepy and need something to do. the bad p<br />art is that it messes up a lot.
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|My 6 and 7-yr-old were thoroughly entertained, and it was mildly enjoyable for dad to watch too.  Whether this was pieced together with video game cut scenes or not, I didn't notice.  The computer animation is high quality and voice acting excellent.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|I really liked it at first... over time it became one of those apps I don't use on my kindle...
B000N4SHPS|5.0|The great sequel to the classic rocky. Rockys wife has been long dead and rocky comes out of retirement to fight mason dixon. I am glad that rocky V didn't finish the series
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Most \\"Classics\\" are labeled as such because over time they continue inspire, educate, and appeal to each new generation. This book is no exception.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|I just love this movie and it's extras my favorite part is when he knocks down apollo creed in like the 1st Round if you like sports movies that you will love this
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Simply wonderful series albeit definitely romanticized.  Great acting, writing, and wonderful humour.  British television at its best.  I can't wait for the next season.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Avoid this film at all costs.  After viewing this film for 50 minutes I would not go any further; it is bad enough I wasted about $20 dollars on this purchase but I did not want to waste another minute of my time.  I had hoped to see President Lincoln brought back to life with the fine acting abilities of Daniel Day-Lewis and the outstanding direction of Steven Spielberg but instead this movie is slow and constipated.  It goes on and on and on and on and on and on about the 13th amendment. Mr. Spielberg needs a directorial laxative.  Read all the one star reviews and take them to heart.  I truly believe you could, and would, get more excited watching grass grow.  In fact, as I write this review my eyes are drawn to a nearby window and I feel myself gazing at the front lawn and by comparison............that's far more entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. it is probably better then temple run 2 and the original! But if I could say...the game is kind of glitchy on my kindle fire HD its really clear on my phone but its glitchy sometimes to. Other then that the game is super fun!  I love it! 5stars :)
B007REV4T8|4.0|Dear Sirs,<br /><br />I like to know about my order of DVD \\"Skyfall\\". Could you please informed me the status of this order. When it has been deliverd.<br /><br />I'm looking forward your answer.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Glenn Matrona<br />Kaya Barbulètè 50
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I could play all day, it's a great time killer. I am still trying g to figure out how to get more medals. Looking forward to more of these games.
B00881VLCE|3.0|it has very few pictures to choose from  i don't like that you have to by more  and the new pic packages don't have very many to them  but it is very fun
B00999DFP0|5.0|I love this show and hate commercials so this is a must have!<br />Some of the dvd's skip, but that may be my player.<br />Delivery was ahead of schedule.
B008MEM24S|5.0|so addictive and fun  can't wait for more levels to come  And I just love Perry he is my fave
B00B5DWI2O|4.0|Beautiful CD, as well as all of Olafur Arnalds music.  Really appreciate the voice of Arnor Dan.  I am a little disappointed because the song \\"No Other\\" was suppose to be on this CD, but it is missing.  This is the reason I purchased.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I don't get what all the fuss is about.  I didn't get past the first 2 chapters.  I thought it was poorly written and could well have been the work of a pubescent teenager...
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I used to like this game and I had a lot of money and Colors. But when I got on it today all of my Colorado were gone!!! and it said that I never had them but I was so close in having all of the Colorado so I am goon to delete this app. do not buy it unless u want to loose your colors after 2 weeks .......:C
B002RVZV9K|4.0|A weird grouping of guitarists make up this interesting crowd of \\"legendary\\" guitarists, of which only Jimmy Page qualifies for. I found myself skipping thru the dvd to find his parts. The edge's guitar work is WAY too processed for me to consider it real guitar playing....not sure what he would do without it all. And Jack White.....who?? Legendary? No way...he has some interesting chops but he just doesn't fit in. How was he even chosen for this project? I felt embarassed for him, sitting there in his goofy hats and paper covered guitar, spouting his guitar wisdom in front of Page....yikes!.....no. Please go home and leave this to the big boys, come back in 20 years and we will see how you have done. Great dvd tho, great look into U2 history, Jimmy Page history and even a peak in Page's guitar warehouse!
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|It was a great movie. Not a lot of action but was more about emotions and human connections. The characters have played out really well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Yeah, my daughter loves this game.  Almost to the obsessive point.  She loves the responsibility of having to take care of something brings her pet dog.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|It was just a ok movie. Lots of a violence and some unbelievable things happening (don't want to say them as it'll be too much to reveal). A bit disappointing since I rented this going by the reviews.
B003YBUSMW|4.0|The Xbox racing games aren't much fun without a steering wheel. This wheel is easy to use and performs well.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This is a great movie about a true story of the relationship between a caretaker and a paraplegic. It is a very touching story that contains many laughs and a powerful message of viewing someone differently than how society views them.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this movie was rated R. There is no nudity, the language is minimal, and virtually no violence or blood. I believe mature kids can watch it, but it may not interest them.
0307592731|5.0|This was a gift for a friend & she raved about it. Recommended for anyone who likes reading about travels and insite into character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game continues to update which is great. The high cost of items is also awesome because it gives us something to strive for. Keep up the great work. I love it because it is very addictive and most of all it doesn't require internet to play it like most apps. I also enjoy the ever changing little perks you get.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie may seem religious, but it is very true that you can only be a good father if you're the example of what you want your kids to be. If we're honest we know that do what I say not what I do, does not work and does not leave any good impact on the children.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is mind engeriziing. The fact that you have to think and not just play mindlessly is a great idea.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it, it gave me so many fun ideas ; )<br />But to give you a little more info, the story was captivating.  I could really see and feel everything in the story. ( Or was that just my hormones running wild!!!)
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is very well written - not too much extraneopus drag - just a grabber that keeps you wanting more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is absolutely AWESOME!!!! I love this game!!!And so does my kids. I would recommend it to anyone to try with their family
B004I744AS|5.0|I really love this app! Yesterday, my sister asked me what economy meant. I told her look at your dictionary app. She and I love the app.YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!

B00425S1H8|5.0|Easy installation in Windows and works great. Not much more to say. Much smaller than the previous one that I owned.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is  a really cool and funny game and it is great for kids. I love how it updates every month and u guys add new stuff to make the game really interesting.
0988936402|5.0|The First Pillar (Everville, #1) will make you eagerly wait for his every novel and deeply care about the finely crafted adventurous and passionately real stories he crafts.<br /><br />Movie producers, pay attention here for some vivid imagery, intricately woven plot development and a captivating, unique story that would thrill viewers, as well as readers, on the screen.<br />This is a wonderful book; the reader can really connect to the characters. In my opinion, Roy Huff novels should be included with other popular young adult science fiction/fantasy classics like The Giver, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Wizard of Oz, etc.<br /><br />This story has some great life lessons. It teaches us to appreciate all that we have in life and urges us to consider life without some of the things we see as necessities, but in a realistic way. This book also encourages a younger generation to think about war and peace in a very appropriate way. It challenges us to think of all the harm done by fighting but also the challenges that come with doing something good, especially when all you want is revenge. Definitely a worthwhile read!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Best action sequences and Bond script ever. Sorry to see M die but did add to the total movie experience.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Obviously it's a good game if it's like temple run well people I think it's a good game and all of you people out there should get this very addictive game but that's my opinion but I'd say if you don't like this app your stupid
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music!  I hope CD's don't wear out because this one gets played over and over and over.  The skill of these musicians is breathtaking!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This made my kindle fire hd become a mini laptop!I haven't tried it away from home yet, but that will be my next step with this.
1567184855|1.0|I would really love for this book to be true, but there are just too many reasons for me thinking it is a load of rubbish.<br /><br />Mr Newton seems to be making millions from his books and speaking tours about souls. That alone makes me skeptical about his motivations.<br /><br />I am about halfway through and if you accept the far-fetched notion that people have an inner soul that continues after life, then there are some questions that need to be answered.<br /><br />1. Why can no-one else replicate his findings and get people to talk about past lives? He does it apparently with ease.<br /><br />2. Where are these people who have had revelations about past lives? None of them have come forward that I could find. Apparently they are now fully at peace with death, but are very quiet about their experiences.<br /><br />3. What are details of his qualifications? Where did he get his doctorate from and what is exactly is a Master Hypnotherapist? It sounds like a karate champion or something, but an academic qualification? I highly doubt it.<br /><br />4. If he is lying about his qualifications why would I believe anything else he says?<br /><br />I fear death like most other people, and I so wanted this book not to be a fraud, but unfortunately it appears to me that I was misled.
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|Doesn't even come close to the first one. Not sure why they even made it. No clear vision for the film at all.
B004LROUNG|1.0|I am really amazed that Grisham cranked out something like this.  As others have said, there' not much to it -- the plot isn't strong, it doesn't build to any kind of real climax, and the characters aren't particularly well developed.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I am a Jane Austen fan.  This is by far the best EMMA yet!  Romola Garai was so believable.  Her expressions were so convincing you could almost read her thoughts on her face.  The scenes were so fresh and alive.  I enjoyed every minute of it and as always the end of the movie made me wish once again the somewhere, someone would discover another manuscript by Jane Austen that would prove to be the best of the best!
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Amazon makes you write something instead of just letting you give it a star rating. So I am just putting down as much inane crap as I can in way of protest.  I actually enjoyed the book, just not the stupid requirement for adding wording to their review.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works perfectly for my needs...especially balancing my checkbook. Easy and convenient to use. I definitely suggest this app.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|The movie is good , and worth the watch . It is the same old plot , But after 80 plus years of movie making , Hollywood is out of plots , so they feed us the same stuff and we watch it , and pay a fortune to watch it so they can make lots of money , Would like to see the big actors mabey put some discount or free tickets for the people who cant afford to take their kids to the movie , A family of 4, to go to movies 100 dollars , So alot of kids dont get to go because they cant afford it , that is wrong...........By the way yes i have 6 kids and can afford to go to the movies except we spend about 300 dollars that is messed up...................
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been an avid weightlifter for 30 plus years. I have read many books, mags and articles during those years. Mike cuts through the bull and gives good straight forward advise. I enjoyed the book and have encouraged other lifters to read it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Rip off !!!dont by waste 7 dollars if do buy  hate the game you referring all you do is jump boo
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This movie is not about the life of Lincoln. It is about the struggle he has making the decision to free the slaves. It is based on a novel and I'm not sure how historically accurate it is. Watch this movie to see Daniel Day-Lewis. Once again the actor transforms himself into someone else. He is totally believable! The rest of cast are all great.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|Life has too much sorrow as it is. This book is filled with unexplained malice, greed, hopelessness. Definitely not a good read for anyone with emotional issues. Though well-written and a classic, there are much better things to read.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I love period movies when it is done right. The attention to detail is great and believable. The props and wardrobe department did a great job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome I lov the mystery boxes the most they give u something that will always b good.  I also liv the fact that it changes places for u I was once in Rome but now I'm in Sydney. its also fun too some people may say that its the same thing as temple run but its nothing like temple run s.s has better grafics people and it has more upgrades like there's more charactors boards trophies and more I liv this game!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I haved enjoyed playing this game in my spare time. I really recommend it to anyone who is looking for an entertaining game.
B00000IL1K|3.0|Must buy ,if you are Sarah Brightman fan, what a fantastic voice , love her cross-over style ,can't get enough. On the strength of this CD have just ordered her new one.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was disappointed in the &#34;Lincoln&#34; movie.  It was shot with so much darkness that I found it almost hard to watch.  It was totally about how the 13th amendment was passed.  I was wishing there was more to it.  Daniel Day Lewis however played the part of Lincoln very well.  It's not a movie I'd ever purchase to watch again.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I usually expect 5 or 6 good songs on a CD , therefore this one passes as being ok value , I do think some of the songs are a little ordinary, more a case of poor arrangement/backing
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Good book at the beginning, then it turns kind of borrying with a good ending. Hope the movie will be better.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its the best game I have ever played.its so realistic ;its like I'm actually there getting chased by big scary monster which is really good
1401203078|1.0|Love the first two League stories. Really really loved them.Thought they here awesome, instant classics. So when Black Dossier came out i bought it without even thinking about it. Big mistake. What happened to Moore? Wheres the story? the interesting things, the famous characters from literature, the action? This book was filled with nonsense, poems (???), plenty of text without comic book panels or drawings (if i wanted to read books and not comic books i would buy normal books), devoid of plot (the only thing the characters do is to escape and nothing more throughout the hole graphic novel) and everything was porn\sex driven (dont have anything against sex themes or extreme violence as long as it has a porpouse for the plot). This book made me afraid of buying anything with the name League of extraordinary Gentlemen in its title in the future. Sorry for my english, im from Argentina.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an interesting and well told twist on the post apocalyptic genre.<br /><br />There were some unexpected turns in the story and exceptionally well developed characters with believable dialogue. I will be reading more from this author and have already downloaded the next part of this particular story and a couple of other books by the same author.<br /><br />I will add that I rarely pay for any of my kindle books but was convinced to do so in this case because of the (justifiable) rave reviews it had received from other readers..I am very glad that I purchased the omnibus version of Wool (I urge you all to do the same, you will not regret it).<br /><br />Finally, I can only add my praise and earnest encouragement to Mr. Howey and say that I eagerly await more of his tales.
B00A72989U|5.0|Another solid album by Mrs Keys:) as usual there is a song for everyone on this album, a song for every situation life throws at you. I love it, can't complain
B0067R0APK|1.0|I liked the simple version and hate this one. It is difficult to read and a pain to sift through for some quick information.  How do I get the simple one back. I won't be so quick to upgrade in the future.<br />P. Simpson
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This was a fun movie.  I have watched it twice with my preteen and teenager.  I would not recommend for the little ones, the night mares are a bit scary.  The message the movie provides is one we can all accept and strive for.
B00A83075M|5.0|Saw this in theaters, bought it the day it came out. Great movie to watch with a girlfriend, kids, family.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was just really good and beautifully written. It makes you think too. Read it, you wont regret it
B0064QNS62|4.0|My wife likes it but my son dose not he thinks its to hard I have not played it yet
B00BUL0XYG|5.0|This is definitely a departure from the usual Strokes sound, but clearly fueled by the same genius.  As with every Strokes album, I can easily say I'm in love...this will be rocking my ipod for a long time!
B002T921AC|3.0|I  LIKE  HIS  MUSIC<br /><br />IT  IS  MY  NEW  FAVORITE  CELEB<br /><br />BUT  I'M  NOT  HIS  FAN<br /><br />AND  I  DON'T LIKE  HIM  AT  ALL
B007Y36K46|5.0|This is a great movie which has everything you would want. I've read all the books to this series and for a movie adaptation it did not disappoint. I really hope Disney follows up with a sequel,it would be a shame if they didn't.
B003UMW65W|5.0|I'M  GLAD  SHE'S  MOVING  ON<br /><br />AND  I  LOVE  HER  MUSIC<br /><br />AND  SHE  IS  ALSO A  GOOD  ROLE MODEL<br /><br />FOR  ALL  GIRLS
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I need to know what happens next.  I really enjoyed this love story with the details of Christian. Good read.
B00318COS4|4.0|Machinarium is great exercise for the old gray matter.  Moving from scene to scene requires completing a puzzle.  Some are tough, but most just require common sense.  Graphics are somewhat unusual, not your typical adventure game style, but refreshingly amusing.  You can tell the folks who created this game had a wonderful sense of humor, and were able to weave their humor into the game. I especially got a kick out of the walkthrough pamphlet...all the wording is in an unreadable alien language, and puzzles are explained in the accompanying pictures.  Great little game, wish there were more like it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very good app, it's a classic game that I loved for years. I also love that you can skip the ads. Very highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read. Loved the premise,setting and pace. Look forward to more. Just go read the Silo Saga, you can't go wrong.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I play this game a lot but I think it can cost a lot and some games can be hard. it is a very cool app and It passes time.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This is the fourth or fifth time I've read this book, and the second or third time I've bought it. Scalzi's characters may not show a lot of differentiation, but his world building and slightly sardonic tone are great. Highly recommended, and I also recommend the other books set in this world (Human Division is the most recent, but also Ghost Brigades and even Zoe's Tale)
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Love Judy Garland.  Neighbors come over to see the movie with me and enjoy it as much as I do.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Movie was good, story moved right along... video playback stopped both times while watching requiring me to reboot my roku player.
B005LAIH54|5.0|We ALL enjoyed this movie.  Kept us all entertained. Special effects were good. Grandkids loved the flying horse. Would recommend it
B007FROH4G|4.0|Great reading very real if you may be going through such a thing gives a good understanding if you know someone who is going through this illness.
B0034G4P80|5.0|WOW, Chris is HOT in this movie. Grandkids loved the movie as well. Glad I bought it. Well worth the money
B000085RPU|1.0|I thought region 2 meant the shipping area it came from by UPS standards.  This was a gift for my nephew for Easter.  Imagine his disappointment when he could not play it.  I since researched at your site what Region 2 was, I must say it took me almost 20 minutes to find the answer, which is not very user friendly,  Thus I am now stuck with a movie that cannot be viewed and wasted my time and money
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Grandkids loved this movie. Anyone who needs a good movie without all the stuff young kids should not see.  This is it..
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I enjoy having a physical copy, as well as a digital copy to take with me to watch on the go.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan and Sara really did a great job on this album. Closer, Goodbye Goodbye, and Shock to Your System are some of my favorites. They have a very unique sound.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Adjust your pictures so they look more balanced..add some basic effects such as warmth, contrast, , sharpness of focus..add basic text to identify your picture..a favorite short quote...then add  it to your computer to add to your picture library..or you can share it directly to facebook, etc..
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! This app makes pinning easy. I really like how clear and crisp the photographs are from the pins. With all of the different categories to pin from, creating pin boards is a little addictive. I love this app. Well deserving of a 5 star rating.
0812993292|2.0|too unrealistic. but in our book club of 12 members only 3 did not like it. Others thought it was delightful.
B00C1E8E7E|4.0|Tyler's biggest charm and drawback is his immature, rebellious nature. This shines through in the very first track, where he converts a serene, calming intro into a profanity-laden tirade. The song sets the tone for the entire album: incredible, seasoned talent somewhat marred by Tyler's tendency to dampen the effect of his genius with no longer needed antics. Tracks like domo 23, awkward, treehome95 and lone exhibit Tyler's growth as an artist and show that his talents extend beyond rap. But, at 18 tracks, the album is a bit longer than it needs to be. Songs like \\"tamale\\" are throwaway songs that make the album drag. All in all, an excellent effort by the odd future frontman that lends serious credence to the argument that he deserves to be considered one of the upper-echelon artists of contemporary hip hop.
B000SEI230|4.0|this is my only means to contact you....I was charge twice on &#34;Safe Haven&#34; by Sparks....I gave that as a gift to claribel528@gmail.com.....maybe I can pick up another book with same price. franklalas@hotmail.com. thank you!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|A must read by any who loves an eloquent and inspiring novel.  Jane Eyre will be come your friend, you will not easily put down this novel.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|I love Kevin Bacon as well as the rest of the cast. If I have free time I watch the show while looking through a magazine. There are way to many irrational situations going on. Unfortunately, The Following is not even close to &#34;kinda&#34; believable. Too Bad, I really do like the cast. A lot of great actors and actresses.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is pretty kool play it off and on a lot. always liked to play find object games. fun game
1594202842|1.0|...Look elsewhere.  You know how there's always that one mom at your kid's thing that's forever hovering off stage and staring daggers at her kid when he/she messes up? Her kid always looks like a plant that's been kept in the dark, and everyone makes those stereotypical jokes about Cold War era commie-mommies who pushed their kids like drill sergeants to fit the mold, no matter what the cost?  Well, Miss Amy Chua is one of those moms, and she isn't the least bit sorry, thankyouverymuch. Because lets get one thing straight right now: Amy Chua is better than you. In fact, about a third of her &#34;parenting memoir&#34; is dedicated to listing the reasons why.  The highlights: When you were still eating playdough, Amy was building a tree house for her younger siblings. When you were majoring in art at community college and on-and-off-again-dating that cute but lukewarm engineer who just wouldn't commit, Amy was double majoring in mathematics and law at one of the best schools in the country, and marrying a human Ken doll from old Jewish money.   Her kids are better than your kids. And even if you do somehow get your kids into the schools her daughters attend, they aren't going to be playing with your kids. They're far too busy taking every advanced class there is for tiny musical geniuses, 7 days a week and 365 days a year (sick days do not exist). And yes, they are top in every one. Play dates? Sleep overs? She'd sooner let her kids eat dirt.   This is NOT a memoir of a one of those moms who learns that kids are human beings and need to grow and learn at their own pace and all that jazz. No siree. THIS is a 200+ page manifesto in which Amy openly brags, taunts, and laughs to the reader about driving her daughters to 'greatness' using the kind of verbal, mental, and emotional abuse on them that would get children from average income homes taken away. It's also a sneering indictment of 'fat, lazy, American parenting'. Every other page Amy reminds us that all the hugsand kisses and encouraging words in the world won't get your kids into Julliard like hers are. At times, Amy also waxes philosophic and misty-eyed about China and how smart, accomplished, and good-looking it's kids are compared to American kids, often to the point of racism. Of China's wide spread grinding poverty, oppressive government, appalling environmental practices, and hundreds of millions of citizens without access to clean water? Not a word. The Chinese churn out more perfect Ivy League robots than America does, and that's what counts in Amy's world: Appearance over Class. Conformance over Innovation.  You might ask, &#34;If this isn't a warm and fuzzy memoir of mother-daughter bonding, then what is it?&#34;  The answer is the title. It's a Battle Hymn.  One of the main themes in the book (after you get past Amy's rambling resume of superiority) is her protracted war of wills with her youngest daughter Lulu, and Lulu's career along side her sister Sophia in classical music. Always &#34;willful&#34;, at 13 Lulu full on &#34;rebelled&#34; and refused to bend to any of Amy's abusive tactics. Did she do drugs? Get pregnant? Post nude pics of herself on the net? No. She just dared to stop playing music and start playing tennis. TENNIS. This leads Amy to spitefully label Lulu a &#34;true American kid,&#34; meaning she doesn't care about status or perfect test scores or almighty Julliard. She just wants to be a kid. Amy wants her to be a virtuoso. Lulu just wants to play endless rounds of lack-luster tennis. So what does Amy do? She embarks on a will-breaking campaign of abuse, of course. It gets so bad that Lulu has what could be called a brief break with sanity, and hacks off half of her own hair nearly to the scalp! That really is very depressing and disturbing to read about. But Lulu, bless her heart, doesn't give in. She call's her mom's bluff every step of the way. When Amy starts hissing abuse in public, Lulu simply draws disapproving public attention by screaming and crying. A tactic Amy admits she hadn't counted on and was, at first, flummoxed by. She didn't want the real her exposed, whining to the reader &#34;No one wants to be a pariah!&#34;  Amy had learned a stinging lesson about showing her true nature years previously, when, at an elegant dinner party, she gloated about routinely calling her daughter &#34;garbage.&#34; This upset one of the guests so badly that the poor woman fled in tears, leaving Amy standing in the ringing silence, all eyes on her. Even bumper-sticker-on-a-Ferrari-classy Amy managed to comprehend what a spectacular faux pas she had committed, and was mortified (though as always, completely unashamed).  Amy's solution? Beat Lulu to the punch and write a freakin' book about her toxic parenting and let the whole world know about it. A Mommy Dearest autobiography. She splashes out in a tidal wave of nouveau riche bad taste, airing all her dirty laundry and almost certainly killing whatever slim chance she had of entering the world of the true Old Money elite she's so desperate to be a part of. Another of Amy's wonderful qualities: She chases after Old Money like Gollum chases after the One Ring. I practically sprained my neck cringing from all the secondhand embarrassment. For all her conniving and social maneuvering, her stunning lack of self-awareness has been her undoing.   Battle Hymn finally ends with Amy perched buzzard-like in the stands of the tennis court, watching Lulu play tennis and ruminating about her plans for Lulu's future, with a sneering &#34;now that everyone knows I'm a 'well-scrubbed hustling rube', what are you gonna do now?&#34; Attitude. We're left with the distinct impression that Amy's need to control her daughter's life is becoming an obsession...   In the last year or so, Amy's eldest, Sophia, the &#34;good&#34; daughter, wrote an impassioned open letter to her mother thanking her for her years of &#34;Tiger mothering.&#34; Call me cynical, but I find it very hard to believe Amy wasn't pacing in the background, chain smoking and dictating every word. After all, in this very book Amy boasts of once refusing to accept her kid's &#34;sloppy&#34; homemade Christmas cards until they went back and actually put more effort into &#34;showing how much they loved her&#34; by 'making her cards that were worthy of her'. Gag.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Game is fun, fast paced and ADDICTIVE!! I have a blast playing it!! Only wish lives added faster! Geat easy game.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|Recommend this exotic and off the chart  kung fu action. This movie is exceptional in what the real kung fu masters is all about.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|Solid movie.  I felt guilty watching it because I'm an Arnie fan and definitely won't watch Total Recall with Farrell but I felt like this fit Howard's world better. The Conan in this actually looked like the book's character. The pure-blood was the best part of the GI Joe movie so seeing her naked was a bonus, plus I'm a sucker for obnoxiously gorgeous eyeballs. Definitely not a movie to learn valuable life lessons from like many seek today but not a bad one to escape to either.
B000002KYR|5.0|now and then itss still a good albume must have all<br />still here what the _______<br />have a zzttooopppp day
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love it it is Avery good game I got addicted very nice.......I play it my mom my sister my brother and my dad
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|It is a great family movie. Loved every minute of it! I watch it with my 8 month old son.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|So worth buying in 3D! :) Love it! So happy that we can now add it to our lord of the rings collection!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I feel that this app for FB is better than the first app that I downloaded, having full FB on my laptop, I would like to see alittle like that without having to go. Pro.
B001YV5068|5.0|I saw the movie on cable and had to have it in my library.  And it was on blue ray too.
B00969PR18|1.0|I was looking for a MAP app and downloaded this one first - i did not like it at all.  I am used to the map app for IPhone and this one did not compare at all.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Having read the book first, I liked that they were able to compress a lot of the introductory material without sacrificing things, but some of the minor changes were confusing.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I think facebook is not user-friendly regardless of the device that is being used unless it is a computer.  It is OK
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! It is totally awesome! The graphics are very realistic and the horses move like they are real! I only wish they were a little more generous with the gems.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is my favorite game.  I really like mobility ware products for ipad and kindle.  They are easy to use.
B000006OS2|1.0|I did not receive the pictured cover of the McLintock I ordered but did not give it much thought since there are so many.  I watched it when I got it and noticed the poor quality.  However my vhs was about the same so I thought maybe this particular movie was not as improved as other dvds.  After watching it again last night I did some reviewing and realized I did not get what I ordered.  My dvd  came from  Gaiam, Inc.  and they basically copy.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is pretty much the same as the version I have on my Iphone.  Weather channel is weather channel - regardless of the device
B003XU02QG|4.0|Having no expectations and knowing that it is action packed movie, this movie definitely earned its 4-stars. It has a decent plot with man-rific action scenes and surprisingly, some suspense. Although I would like to have some character development among the supporting actors, it still delivered a 4-star rating.<br /><br />Note, I could give it a 3 star IF I had weigh in more with the plot-development factor. BUT it's a guy's movie so just sit back and relax. And enjoy the show.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Part 2 was incredible! This is where the whole story comes together.  This is where many unanswered questions are finally answered.  It is also rather traumatic, because you lose many of your well-loved characters.  JK did the appropriate Shakespearean thing and killed off nearly all her characters.<br /><br />Voldemort has the elder wand.  Harry Potter is still hunting Hocruxes, but he doesn't realize just how big of a sacrifice he will have to make in order to destroy Voldemort.  Also plaguing him are doubts about Dumbledore as he learns he may not have known the man as well as he thought he did.  This is where we learn the true loyalties of Severus Snape, and we see a better side of the Malfoy family.<br /><br />Voldemort was rather pathetic, and I didn't know how I felt about that.  In a way, it was nice because it showed how bullies are often what they are because they are frightened people.  Yet, you don't always like your villains being pathetic.  The ending where you see the future is one of my favorites--and it makes up for the trauma of losing nearly everybody you liked.  It gives you the feeling that life did go on.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Very negative reviews of this book for some reasons.  If you want more of the story arcs and plot driven tales that the first books were built on that's what you'll get.  That being said, you can't have epic stories without equally epic buildup.  This book is slower than the first three, by and large, but a step up from Feast.  The conflicts are more personal in nature than grand in scale.  It's an in depth story that is being given a detailed telling.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|When I first watched this, I actually got a little bored.  It seemed to move a little too slowly.  I don't know what happened, but later it didn't seem to move so slowly.  I had been a Harry Potter fan for a little while, then got out of it.  Now I seem to be renewing my interest in it.<br /><br />One thing I was always disappointed with is that there weren't more scenes with Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange.  I preferred the villains to the heroes.  However, JK didn't write much about them either.<br /><br />Part 1 deals with the fall of the Ministry and the tightening grip of the Death Eaters.  Harry is trying to find the Hocruxes so he can destroy Voldemort, but he doesn't always know how to destroy them...or where any of them are.  Meanwhile, Voldemort is trying to find a legendary wand so he can defeat Potter.<br /><br />You see a lot of character development with the difficult circumstances.  Ron must battle his own insecurities before he can be of help to his friends.  I loved the mythology of the Deathly Hallows.
B00AW8VUDG|2.0|Lackluster effort. Boring songs. Nothing remarkable or special about this release. It's not horrible by any means, just not one of their best.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|I'm not sure how this is related to that other movie.. it's ok, not as funny as I thought it would be
B009X011UQ|4.0|This case for the Kindle is lightweight and slim. It's perfect for my purposes. I don't carry it with me daily, so it provides enough protection and is slim enough for my handbag. The standing feature works well for use on desk tops and counters. A great alternative to the more expensive cases.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|i deleted it because it glitched out on me and wouldnt function properly. Game is good other than all the glitches.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|Slammed was my book club's pick for the month of March 2013. This is just not my type of book. I see it as more of a pre teen read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ti's game is so fun keep up the world tours and more new people .I love subway surfers because its the best game ever I don't want it to end ever
B00008PX8P|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed &#34;Song Remains The Same&#34; taken from the '73 Madison Square Garden shows will appreciated what can be done with a camera. For those of us who couldn't afford to follow Zep around the world, these outtakes of the various live shows are a real treat. The editing was pretty well done, though with Jimmy Page looking over your shoulder as executive producer you get it right or else. It's a fun mix of music, from the old BBC stuff to Knebworth. Being biased towards all things Zep I have say thanks for a chance to see some songs that weren't there for many of the U.S. tours-Achilles Last Stand, In The Evening, Trampled Underfoot, and the list goes on. With the new blu-ray technology and 5.1 and 6 and 7.1 audio you can have a very good time with this 2 disc set. With the price being reasonable it has been more than worth the purchase. Enjoy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book was intense and very emotional I weeped in most parts of the story which made feel I was Hope at some point. The way Colleen Hoover wrote the story was incredible. It was clever, real funny, smart and so addictive to read. She's definitely inspired me in my own craft as a musician. My favourite part of the book was the question game between hope and Dean. Even Hope's friends were hilarious.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|This book should be read and understood by companies, both big and small.<br /><br />The idea of metrics of actual behavior should be rooted in all companies - just to provide valid information, which is such a rarity today.
0744014549|5.0|S&oacute; me desagradou a cor do fundo da capa e por falar em capa a arte escolhida &eacute; perfeita.

1476712042|3.0|I was very excited to read this book, and when I was reading it, it was VERY good. I couldn't put it down. However with that said, when I finished it I started to think about the errors.<br />One of them would definitely be Abby. I didn't get many of her choices of emotion. When I thought she should be mad, she wasn't. When I thought the situation was okay, she was furious, and really overreacted.<br />Another would be Travis. I pretty much liked him up until after Vegas. Then he got a little too insecure. All he wanted was Abby and he was borderline stalking her. Even when everything was fine he seemed to be too worried. I mean I get it, she is the love of your life, but it was just weird for him to go from arrogant to somebody with some major self-esteem issues<br />My final problem was that I felt like their connection wasn't explained. The reader gets that they love each other, but why? Abby doesn't really say the characteristics she misses with Travis, and even when she says \\"happy moments\\", there aren't really purely \\"happy.\\"<br />Overall this was a good book, and if you want a captivating romance novel buy it. If not, then look elsewhere.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game the new one Sydney. I love the way you guys made a second chance so if you died and you want another chance just push the button save me I just don't like how you have to buy 25 keys for $5.00. I think you guys should think about that maybe like 2.99 or 3.99 but no not 4.99 for just 25.
B004CGUC06|5.0|I love Fellini. I am a man whose life has been lived in film in a fundamental level. Judge me if you will, but much of who I am is found in film. I won't deny it. It is true, Perhaps, and I will not flatter myself by assuming otherwise, perhaps, Fellini understands my film definition. I don't know. It is who I am. This much I know, Fellini has given me many of the most poignant and lasting visual metaphors I have ever known. They are in many of his films, images that will live for me, and speak to me, forever, as long as I am me. This film is different. This is the Fellini film that provides me with what I sincerely hope is a glorious and beautiful window into his life. I love this film. I was transfixed when I first viewed it, genuinely locked into the world this film showed me, and it is an extended moment of time for which I am eternally grateful...

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Been a Stephen King fan for most of my life, and I have to say this has to be one of, if not the best he's written (IMHO).  Gripped me right from the start, and held my attention and interest to the last page.  Mr. KING did a wonderful job of character development, and as in most of his works, painted such a vivid illustration for us as we're reading along that we can't help but feel like the experience is our own, first hand.  It is a long read, but one that you won't have any problem seeing through to the end.  Enjoy, I certainly did!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read in many years!  Easily matches Tolkien...  Read it now!!!  Or else I will call the wind.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard all of the &#34;talk&#34; when this series originally aired, but never watched it.  I decided to see what all the &#34;hoopla&#34; was about and watched 3 seasons 3 days!  I obviously became entrenched and love it!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|LOVE Led Zeppelin. Went to see this in the theater and almost felt like being at the concert. So, I had to have the collection.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Flipboard is a fun way to select, store snd then read the tremendous amount of material we all scan each day. I love the magazine format that puts it into a publication in a USA Today style allowing us to read more in-depth with the touch of a finger. I'm glad I am an early adopter on this one!
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|my husband LOVES this movie. that's why i sent for it. he can watch it over and over. easy to order, came quickly and in perfect condition.
B00871C09S|5.0|This is another classic Alfred Hitchcock movie, Jimmy Stewart is always great, and I also have his classic, Harvey. He was an exceptional actor. I'm glad I have a site like Amazon were I can find the old movies I love.
B00BY7NK96|4.0|I read this book for reasons of currency. It is very readable and avoids the hokeyness of a lot of similar books. Although the messages are aimed at women there is a utility for men as well. In his NY Times Op-Ed piece David Brooks nicely sums up the messages:<br /><br />&#34;Think about Sheryl Sandberg’s recent book, “Lean In.” Put aside the debate about the challenges facing women in society. Focus on the tasks she describes as being important for anybody who wants to rise in this economy: the ability to be assertive in a meeting; to disagree pleasantly; to know when to interrupt and when not to; to understand the flow of discussion and how to change people’s minds; to attract mentors; to understand situations; to discern what can change and what can’t.&#34;<br /><br />There has been a lot of push-back against this book. I suspect it is not because the messages aren't correct or liked, or because of the perception of Sandberg writing from an ivory tower, but because there isn't much in the way of practical advice about how to 'lean in' in practice. It has a 'just do it' tone that I suspect a lot of people won't like.<br /><br />Worth a read.
0783240236|5.0|I love the classic movies and knew I had to have this movie, It had been a long since I seen it but it still was super creepy. The movie was delivered quick , and at a very good price.
B00821OX98|5.0|Waiting for more, can't wait. Very well done and exciting. Was disappointed when it ended. Looking forward to the new season.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I love this classic movie, I watched it once before and knew that I had to add to my personal collection. I am a big fan Henry Fonda. plus it depict the trails off life in my home state of Oklahoma. Great movie, well acted and a real bargain at the price I bought it for. I love amazon and am now a loyal fan.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Great movie: fun, entertaining, masterful performances. Seriously, what's not to love? About time a movie shows fun can happen at any age, and love can be found where you least expect it ;-)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Good Story. Excellent graphics. Hint system is available and is needed for some of the hidden object puzzle. some of the objects you need to find are really hidden in the floors and background.
B000FGGE68|4.0|I loved the concept of this futuristic world. The visual effects are fun. The action keeps this move fast passed and is enthusiastic and intriguingly choreographed.
B007REV4T8|2.0|My husband is an avid James Bond fan. He says that this was the worst Bond film he's seen. (He loves action flicks..Stallone, Segal, Eastwood but especially Bond so it must be bad. I did not see it...these are his comments.)

B00005JPD0|4.0|I'm a sucker for time travel flicks so this was definitely a must to see.  It was a little tricky in parts so pay close attention but an intelligent flick to view.

And to let go of a potentailly damaging past!!! Thankfull for the read and the friend that recommended it!  Excellent service!! Took awhile to come.. was worth the wait!
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I love this series, and I was kind of hoping for it to end here! I am hoping that \\"The House of Hades\\" is the final book in this series. The end was also unclimatic and boring. I was actually hoping that it would stop right there when Percy and Annabeth let go after the ledge and said \\"We'll see you in to Tartaurus\\" and left it at that. All of the rest of the book is kinda boring, too. What I really want Roridan to focus on is another movie for the series instead of writing cliffhanger after cliffhanger. It gets pretty annoying. And I completely agree with the review below.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I read reviews that said the only real negative about this app is that it increases the drain on the battery more than most users like.  I found that to be true for me.  I'd rather have the extra battery time and just visit my bookmarked weather.com web page when I want the weather forecast.
0099551373|4.0|Really enjoyed this book and sometimes dip back into it. Having done so recently, I was left wondering if the Roman treasure chest was ever found???<br />Not wanting to read the whole book again to find out, I wonder if someone who has just finished it could possibly enlighten me. (a page ref would be great)<br />Many thanks

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a good read, and well worth the money.  A little unrealistic here and there, but overall it's a great story.
B00AA2KBCA|5.0|this is a great movie, and the quality is great. but, you should inform people before spending $14 on a movie I could buy on blue ray for the same price that your giving us a movie with 40 minutes cut out of it. its 2 hours and 42 minutes long but this is only 2 hours and 02 long. ive seen this many times and noticed the time cut and missing scenes. misinformation and cutting running time is not good buisness and definetly is not worth what you charge for your service. im completely dissatisfied.

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|We play together or individually quite frequently. It's a cute game but can be repetitive with limited missions if you are not connected to social media.
B008OOYALE|1.0|They only update the iOS version of the game since December 2012.  This is a stripped down version of the game and extremely laggy with many crashes.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I read this because I often sub in 6th grade, and as part of the new modules many schools will be reading this. So, I was curious why they chose this book and I was very pleased. I could not put it down and have since read the second book in the series and can't wait to start the third.

B008F9T76Q|5.0|Enjoyed all three books. Very interesting reading. what else do you want me to say?  That is all I have. jeez!
0765365278|5.0|This is by far my new favorite series. I had just finished the Wheel of Time series and thought it was great, but for only being the first book; \\"the way of kings\\" blows it out of the water. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who reads fantasy/sci-fi.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is awesome. It is a little challenging. But that is what keeps you playing. You have to circle an island and you are timed. When you run out of time, you keep playing because you want to see what is on the awesome island next. I think that everyone should play this game.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have had this on my laptops for several years now.  It has been wonderful!  When can I get it on my new kindle fire hd??
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good because it has very good graphics to okay in and I like to okay it. That's y I like t this game
B00BVVA138|5.0|I like Howard but nobody - nobody - in metal has ever screamed as well as Jesse. Pure aggression that you can actually understand. If you like metalcore or hardcore, you must give this a listen.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is great for the fast thinker with fast finding skills.  I like it because when I need a break from every thing else for just a few moments this game refreshes and relaxes my mind. It connects you to your friends and family,too.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|We rented this so our teen daughter could watch and see what real movie making is like. This is just a great movie from the 80's. Loved it the first time I watched it and everytime since...Thanks Amazon!!!

6305313687|5.0|The subject in AMERICAN HISTORY X? Racism. On both sides of the coin. And there's nothing i can do but to tip my hat and bow down to Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, the rest of this young daring cast and the team of writer, director, producer and everyone in between for showing determination into taking the matter of this movie and treating it the way they did.<br /><br />Derek Vineyard (Norton) Becomes the leader of a Power to the White extremists a couple years after his dad, part of the force was killed while on duty. And just like any younger brother, Dany (Furlong) has nothing but admiration towards his older brother Derek. One night Derek is sent to prison after committing a murder. It'll take 3 years before he finally gets out. Ashamed of his past, the newly reformed Derek Vineyard is determined to do all that it takes to prevent is brother Dany, from suffering the same fate and anger as he did.<br /><br />I really like that some people dared to make a movie like that. Treating racism like the problem it is but not falling into the trap of depicting the matter as an average white guy trying to fool a couple black guys or vice versa but made it so that the young, wild and angry isn't brainless because he's left with no model or because he's got some dead set principles on how and why he perceives life and its faults in some ways instead of others. This is just a matter of things that's got to be explored instead of ignored or minimised in order to solve it hopefully. And the movie did just the right thing. Letting the audience perceive it the way each and everyone could see it.<br /><br />10/10
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode has been 'my' band for 30 yrs... this album does not disappoint. Hot and bluesy, just the way I like them... Devoted til I die.
630529142X|4.0|I was already used to seeing a stand up comedian like Sandler in movies by director Frank Coraci, and playing a bully before watching the WATERBOY and as much as i loved HAPPY GILMORE and THE WEDDING SINGER, THE WATERBOY is probably FranK Coraci's best movie featuring his star (Sandler) and probably Adam Sandler's best movie to date. Sad he choosed to be more serious after BIG DADDY before coming back to really boring spoof movies.<br /><br />This time, Sandler, who writes his own jokes (Maybe a little too often for the good of his latest movies.) plays Bobby Boucher, a misunderstood 30 years old boy who's got no one but his mother to keep him company. That until the day he finds a job (For free) as the waterboy for a cheap college football team. The team is tired of losing and their coach Kline (Henry Winkler) will soon discover that they should not mess with Boucher anymore and no one should. He'll be tranformed into a raging tackling machine, using all the past mockeries directed at him as a tackling fuel. And what happens once a little stuttering nobody becomes a VI Football player in college? Girls tend to stick to him like a bunch of flies on a bunch of... Well you know. And the girl he meets, Vicky Vallencourt is an old friend of his but his mom already warned Bobby not to hang out with them ladies cuz to her everything is \\"The Devil\\".<br /><br />Well put Adam Sandler as a stuttering ignorant between his mamma (Katy Bates, remember MISERY and DOLORES CLAIBORNE?) and a really determined young criminal, just out from prison who wants to have some good time with mamma's boy (FAIRUZA BALK as Vicky Vallencourt. BALK: THE CRAFT, AMERICAN HISTORY X.) And you pretty much get the whole joke. 2 of the scariest chicks of Hollywood during the ninethies to tame a clown used to date cute and nice little blondes in previous movies. No wonder why he stutters and has to wait til he gets on the field to excorcise himself.<br /><br />But truly, i kind of got into Sandler's playeven more that time, noticing that he could write something a little different, still on the edge of sanity. And personify a really funny Bobby Boucher! Some kind of an actor showed up after all. If only for that one time. Jokes run from one end of the field to the other and will surely catch a couple everytime. A cool little flick for an evening or 2 of fun. At that point, i can probably quote the whole movie. And not only the guys or the lines that were intended to be the funniest.<br /><br />Other than that? BUT MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE STINKY FEET. AND I FIND DEPUTY DOG TO BE VERY S***!<br /><br />8/10

B0015DWLD0|5.0|Read this book on our first trip to India and found that the book was true to the spirit of the country.  A must read for travelers.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This exceptional book explores a the complexities of parenthood for one family as they navigate their way through the legal system. The characters are well developed and easy to identify with, whether or not you agree with their moral decisions. The shocking ending was well worth waiting for.
B00633W614|4.0|In this second episode of the Cliftons, Mr Archer takes us to the end of WW2.  Unlike most of his books there were some character experiences that were too unbelievable.  I am waiting to read for the third book.
B0002KVULG|5.0|Not the newest version of the old favorite, but so far the best looking vampire. Not as gory as the newer versions and yet still a great movie.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Fun game that is pretty simple. You just try to shoot other planes out of the sky. Collect upgrades and better planes. The game is worth getting.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This movie is a great spoof of vampire movies. Johnny Depp is a loveable vampire and this movie is good entertainment for the family.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I had not read John Grisham in some time because they all seemed to have the same plot different characters, different location, but this was a great book with an entirely different ending than I expected.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|What's there to say about this captivating series. One of the best shows on television. Always full of surprises and never boring. A must have for any dvd collection. I got mine!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a great book, a little dark and graprhic but a great read.  Characters are interesting and Haynes addresses so many different psychological challenges.
B00BUI6D2A|1.0|I purchased this album from you guys and this is not even the complete album. I am not purchasing any music from you guys. Do better!!!!
B00A4SJ61W|4.0|The animation was very good and I liked the plot twist.  I was not very happy with the way the plot changed close to the end of the movie.
B0087EACJK|5.0|Iv never played a game quite like this. It requires you to think in many different directions. Like another reviewer said &quot;Think in &amp; outside the box&quot;. Its a very creative idea. And I had to be creative to finish each level. I didnt even know the tilt feature was utilized in this game until I couldnt figure out how to beat a certain level &amp; handed my phone to my husband to look at. When I did, the little guy fell up! They probably explained that in the instructions but I didnt read the instructions. :\<br />It has an average number of levels, 6 worlds with 8 levels in each. There is a World 7 but that only has 1 level. I think it could be longer, but its long enough for the price. You can reset your scores so you can play again without having to uninstall/reinstall. I was just enjoying myself so much that I was bummed when I finished it. But it wasnt a rip off or anything.<br />This is a very fun physics based game. I will definitely play it through again. The music isn't bad. It can get a little annoying because it's so repetitive.<br />Oh &amp; where is Continuity 1?! If this is Continuity 2 there has to be a 1, so where is it? I want more levels! lol
B001OFJPIS|3.0|As with most sequels, the follow-up doesn't quite measure up to the original, but it was still okay. Surprisingly little gore, but not for kids.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This game is very addicting. It helps me a lot. I play it ever day and it helps me be occupied.
B00B2064IY|5.0|I found this to be a nice surprise after all the time has passed since Jimi Hendrix passed. Some reviewers here are supa-critical, bordering on being haters. Not me. Enjoying it as we speak. Thanks Jimi.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game for the young and mid teen. Very nice to play with and overall very enjoyable. A game for both girls and boys.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is installed on my wife's Kindle and she absolutely loves it.  She no longer has to look for her deck of cards and no longer has to shuffle the cards. It is a great addition for the Kindle, keeps her occupied for hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this app was super great.  I love how it is like temple run and temple run brave.  I would recommend this app to anyone that wants a high action game.  The only downside  of it was to share your high scores you would have to log into Facebook.  Other than that 5 stars.  Great app!!!!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|gameloft has made another great game! I played the first dungeon hunter and that was great and this time they took it a step further and really improved the game play.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|The game is great but the zombies are a challenge the control's are unknown at first but u get the hang of it soon
B001H1SVO8|4.0|LOL. Good old \\"Fight Club\\". Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Meat Loaf (?!). OK, I admit it. I loved this film when I was younger. Ten years ago? Watching a TV rerun of it just a few hours ago, I felt nothing special. I suppose I have other interests now.<br /><br />But sure, it's not a *bad* movie. If you like bizarre, unusual stories with unexpected plot twists, you're gonna love \\"Fight Club\\". It's not a co-incidence that this twisted story is considered a cult movie!<br /><br />The main character (who is unnamed) is a bored, lonely white-collar employee with some pretty weird pastimes who meets a mysterious stranger on the airplane. The stranger, Tyler Durden, convinces him to join a fight club which turns out to be a cover for an advanced terrorist operation against modern civilization. The plan is to recreate a more natural, primitive society with economic equilibrium by blowing up all major credit institutions. Sounds eerily familiar, somehow. The Unabomber? Deep Green Resistance? However, the political message is really a footnote to the rest of the story, with its various subplots, each more insane than the other. \\"I know you are a tourist\\".<br /><br />Apparently, \\"Fight Club\\" is based on a novel and is supposed to have some really deep message about the alienation of the late 20th century White male. Or something to that effect. Others see it as a protest against consumerism. I admit that neither I nor my buddies got it. To us, it's simply an absurd cult classic, featuring Brad Pitt - neither more nor less. It's a movie you might like if you enjoyed \\"True Romance\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\" or (perhaps - but that's a very big perhaps) \\"The Matrix\\". If the film is \\"about\\" anything, I'd say it's a fictionalized case study of a very severe bout of schizophrenia!<br /><br />And don't forget: The first rule of \\"Fight Club\\" is... ;-)

1439152802|5.0|So although I haven't read the book yet, I gave it 5 stars because I'm sure it will deserve it, AND i don't feel it's right to punish the author and her work with a low star rating just so i can say what i came to say. But PLEASE fellow book reviewers...........KEEP THE SPOILERS TO YOURSELF!!! I've been scrolling through, trying to get a feel for the book and i keep reading spoilers! People reading the reviews most likely haven't read the book yet, so why do other people feel the need to give away details in their review that are not in the publisher's synopsis??? I'm glad for you that you read the book in just a few hours, I really am. But PLEASE don't ruin it for the rest of us who haven't read it yet. Although i kind of had a hunch at what the \\"shocking crime\\" was, it's been confirmed thanks to someone else's review. So now that tension and anticipation will be ruined when i DO read it. So please please PLEASE, don't do that. Rate the book, give your glowing praise, but DON'T give the story away!!!!!!!

B0069JBKHI|1.0|In our shopping preparing for baby, the Withings Smart Baby Monitor ended up being my biggest regret of a purchase.<br /><br />This was a splurge for my new baby's nursery. I felt I could justify the price because it was for safety. The fact that you check in on the baby from anywhere was important since my husband is away often. It seemed like a good way for him to still be connected while out of town. I also liked the thought of just using my ipad or iPhone for a monitor screen.<br /><br /> This ended up being a total waste of money. After complications with set up, we attempted to contact customer service, which was a complete joke. Discovering the problem on our own, we were up and running. The amount of delay time makes me nervous to rely on this. The delay is my biggest complaint. The app often crashes. And I have found that it makes more sense to have a monitor screen completely dedicated to the monitoring the baby- Not an ipad or iPhone, which is often being used for other tasks.<br /><br />The one thing I like about the monitor is its aesthetics. That's it. It's way too expensive for something pretty that doesn't work correctly. After spending so much money on this and still needing a working real-time monitor, I had an issue with shelling out for another expensive monitor. Our solution has been a cheap $20 monitor and FaceTime when dad is gone.

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Loved it and really good recording, selection of classic Jimi Hendrix and yes i would definitely recommend it to others.
1400067820|3.0|There are many nuggets and things that it is entertaining to think about in this; the published full reviews discuss them in depth.  But the book is padded and overlong.  THE BLACK SWAN was much better.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I didn't think when I read the first book &#34;beautiful creatures&#34; that I would ever read a better book in my life. I have been proven wrong! I am very excited to read the next book and see what happens to Link and Ridley along with John!
B00B935SUY|5.0|A documentary chronicling the start and end of Sound City Studios in Van Nuhy's California. Most of the artists that recorded land mark albums talk about their experiences at the studio in this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. From me to my 13 yr old.I play against my friends on Facebook. I love how the change up the screens.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so wonderful. It keeps me awake when I'm bored and it keeps my kids with something to do while on the road.
B003D12ESE|5.0|Excellent HD picture with no problems.Enjoyed movie and Amazon service.Watched it streaming via my Roku.Great action movie.would recommend to anyone.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I have been using this case day in and day out since Christmas.  One of my school text books is in electronic format which is why I got the Fire in the first place.  This case has protected my Kindle Fire from minor scratches and the occasional bump as it is carried around in my school bag.  The only flaw I have seen is the elastic band that holds the cover closed or open.  This band is showing ware and is becoming loose.  I can see with time that this will get to the point of not doing it's job.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|The story telling is wonderful.  The premise nearly unbelievable.  The reality griping.  John Hawkes is amazing...he gives a &#34;moving&#34; performance even without moving much of anything. Helen Hunt...well, she leaves nothing to the imagination, but an exception bit of acting.  Bold and Beautiful...a great story of caring.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a very easy read, interesting main character, and a cool time period.  I am a big fan of books with reading lists within (like Matilda) and this one has sent me on a fun adventure of going through the books the main character reads throughout the story.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Inspirational at many levels.<br />View this film once and be surprised.  View this twice and be in awe.  By the third viewing, this film become instructional about true qualities of a well centered human being and the art of living life to the fullest while living for others.<br />A must see!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As with his other books, I'm glued to it till the end and chuckling all the way through.  I love the sarcastic John Corey.
B001G0N1QS|1.0|took almost a month to get my dvd and guess what?  It was a region 2 dvd.. Cannot watch region 2 on a normal dvd player.. Zoverstocks did NOT have any information that this was a region 2 product... Gee, nice suprise... Never again!!

0060776579|5.0|I give it 5 stars... It makes so much sence. T.Harv Ever explains everything about money you should know in very direct and simple way. Don't be a victim take charge of your life and remember you are responsible for your life how you live...
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC news provides readers with a wealth of information that is current and ongoing. I really enjoy this app.<br />As always Amazon aims to please.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thought it was a very fun and interesting game and I hope they make a second part to this game
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Quite an interesting and beautiful app. I love the blue hue that the clock shows. I am yet to try plugging it in all night.<br />A great buy.
B008XCJ03K|3.0|It was a good album and I really like the songs. Very David Gray -esque but no one can really compare to David.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is one of my favorite games.  I now have the free trial and I purchased the  complete set.<br />I am really thankful for receiving these apps as an international customer.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Game looked promising but boy was I wrong it could have been very good if the storyline had been played out the game was far too short especially for the money all in all I had high hopes and was extremely let down got a long way to go to at with the big boys steer clear it's a rip off!
B00499NHLC|4.0|I was not expecting much, but this series was very, very good. Both leads are great and the stories were compelling.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love this game.  You will have to buy it to continue through. Well worth the minimal cost.  Visually and mentally pleasing.  Very entertaining.
030758836X|5.0|The best way to experience this book is to read it first, before reading ANY reviews. I loved the book, but I had read one review beforehand that, while it didn't contain any actual spoilers, still let me know enough about the plot to see what was coming from the start. So for me, I felt like the book would have been even more enjoyable if I had no advance warning of what to watch out for. That said, the plot was extremely fun to follow, like putting an intricate puzzle together. Very satisfying when the final piece clicks into place!
0425263908|5.0|I'm enjoying the story, and I would recommend it to others.<br />If you enjoyed 50 Shades, you will love this book.
0061353248|5.0|I greatly enjoyed his second book, read as part of his Coursera class and book bundle [[ASIN:B00BHEJ4IW The Irrational Bundle: Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality, and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty (eBook Bundle)]] in April 2013. Always lots to think about, making Behavioral Economics very accessible.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is like the best game ever made for my kindle fire its so better then btd4 so you really need to get it
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Three stars.  I enjoyed the book but would not be a re-read.  The book was emotional, I cried through it.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app for any station that is not a Clear Channel station. Very easy to navigate and use and has many of the same features as iheartradio.
0307476464|5.0|I enjoyed every word, every sentence, every paragraph, every chapter.  I wanted it to go on and on and on....  This is definitely in the top five books I have ever read.  I so enjoyed Aomame and Tengo (especially Aomame).  The subtleties of entering the 1Q84 universe were handled masterly by the author.  What a love story!!!  A love story that begins when Aomame grabs and squeezes Tengo's hand when they were children.  What a perfect beginning for a love story.  What a perfect ride in between.  And, what a perfect ending.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Didn't take long to do all the puzzles in the app. I just like apps a little more challenging or with more pictures.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|Has a lot of helpful information. I enjoy reading it on my ipad.  I was recommend this to everyone who loves to knit
B004YXE438|5.0|Love the puzzles and how you can select the size and level of difficulty. Beautiful pictures that are very vibrant.
B00631VJIC|4.0|I guess it was Ok.  I bought it as a gift and it was enjoyed. That is all I can say
B00003CX9E|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Its a great story based on a real life person. Great acting and I enjoyed the time period its from.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Very cool concept, nice construction and appearance, nice features, and excellent headphone sound... but the microphone sound quality is awful, at least it was in our case, using it for Skype and voice recording on Win 7 64 bit. No amount of adjusting mic position, changing drivers, adjusting gain, etc. seemed to improve it. Punted and returned to Amazon. Really disappointed, because we wanted this to be great. It wasn't.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|The show truly gains momentum in the second season. This is a great show, definitely worth watching. And From the looks of the previews of Season 3, it's only going to get better!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is so addictive.  Loads of fun and entertainment. Love the graphics!!! The game is simply awesome!!  The game goes from city to city around the world with new challenges, and upgrades. I really recommend this game to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it is awesome and it is very fun I think you guys should make a game that is Florida version.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Harry hole is back and as usual he is on the case. He is a determined policeman who is dedicated to the truth.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Not my usual type of book but I found it interestingly written. The descriptions of the quiet ways of introverts is revealing and so true.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Green Lantern is the name of multiple superheroes from the DC Universe, all of whom are characterized by a power ring and the ability to create solid constructs with the ring.<br /><br />Each Green Lantern possesses a power ring and power lantern that gives the user great control over the physical world as long as the wielder has sufficient willpower and strength to wield it. The ring is one of the most powerful weapons in the universe and can be very dangerous. While the ring of the Golden Age Green Lantern (Alan Scott) is magically powered, the rings worn by all subsequent Lanterns are technological creations of the Guardians of the Universe, who granted such rings to worthy candidates. These individuals made up the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps.<br /><br />The movie kept my kids at the edge of their seats, they comment about it for the rest of the weekend.<br />It is a good movie to spend time with the family.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|First time that I have read Lee Child and I found the story riveting. Will be reading more of the Jack Reacher character books.
B0090SI460|5.0|My kids were a bit hesitant to watch a movie of monsters, they believed it could be like those horror movies daddy watch from time to time :) but this was completely different.<br /><br />Great movie for toddlers, it really changes the way they look at their closet monsters by adding humor and all of the concerns “monsters” have to deal with.<br /><br />Thumbs up. Good movie.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Second book and I still like Lee Child's ability to create a story so different from his first book. I will be reading his third jack Reacher book to see if I tire of his story or ability to keep me guessing.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This is a must tool but I have to admit that they really push advertising to the limits.<br />I guess that is the price to pay for free stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for all ages!!! It is super fun and diffenetly worth the time!!! It is also great that they have so many types of different people you can choose as your character!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Enjoyed the beautiful graphics, familiar yet interesting mini games, and the new storyline.  The only issue was setting clock to the right time; I don't recall finding a clue for it.  I would be quite interested in a sequel.
015670160X|4.0|I had to read this for a Women's Study class that I took in college. It's a bit weird in that the man character changes into a man and in a mythological type way, but it's worth a read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Anyone who has read and appreciated the hunger games or the maze runner series will enjoy this story. Very thought provoking.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I use this as a news app to read national news. I don't normally watch a lot of news on television so this a great way to keep me informed.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Beautifully boxed set. Definitely collector quality package and lots of extra scenes. Perfect and appropriate gift for my favorite hard core TREKKER !
B008XG1X18|4.0|I don't use the app that much mainly because I like to use pinterest on my computer, but it is fun to look at every once in a while.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|i thought the book was great i loved how when the ecscape to the city things just started to get even more exciting oif you have read the scorch trails read THIS book  because i think Dashner did a great job. i personally  think its the best in the series.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a super fun game with really great animations. It is really awesome and the components change a lot which makes it really fun
B005LAIII0|5.0|Wonderful movie...great story line and the HD color was something else. I would recommend this movie for all to see.
B00821OUT6|5.0|The character development is surprisingly very good. The aliens look real and the story through season 1 and 2 is well done. This is currently the best sci fi show out! I cant wait for season 3
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I liked the movie but it was too much like the series. I got bored with about the first 45min. It finally picked up in the action. All in all the movie was good, but was expecting much more.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is one you can play before falling to sleep to rid your mind of the days journeys. It's addicting so beware!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun, fun thing to play.<br />Very cute and imagitive.<br />Makes the time go by in a hurry,
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|I've read this book a number of times over the years and I continue to find out more about the author's psyche and enormous talent. At times they seem to make war with each other, which may explain why some artists descend into madness or addiction.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game it rocks. Especially because you get to take care of horse I love horses!  THIS GAME ROCKS
B007US9NA8|5.0|This is simply the best and most comprehensive book on bodybuilding money can buy. It hits every single aspect of training, dieting, and contest prep. Everything is short and to the point. Whether you are a beginner, seasoned athlete, or aspiring Mr. Olympia, you can't go wrong here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a nice and exciting game and I love it. Now it got better with intro of key life saving options to get more life  like in temple run<br />... overall it's free so gotta love it
1400069742|5.0|My father fought in World War II, and my mother saw her brothers and nephews become soldiers. I grew up on my mother's stories and would beg her to \\"tell about what happened the day of Pearl Harbor\\" over and over again. World War II was as real to me as my childhood days in the 1960s. My parents, like most kids in the 1920s, were awed by Charles Lindbergh's historic flight, but during World War II they never forgave him (nor other Americans like Henry Ford) for \\"siding with\\" the Germans and the isolationist faction. When I saw this book I knew I had to read it to get more information on the isolationist movement.<br /><br />Olson's absorbing book examines the tense years of 1939 through 1941, when Great Britain was hanging on by their fingertips from the Nazi onslaught and desperate for any type of help, be it equipment or munitions (but hopefully manpower), from the United States. Americans had been badly bruised by \\"the war to end all wars.\\" Having marched home triumphantly after making \\"the world safe for democracy,\\" they were disillusioned by the war dead and injured, the continued squabbling for territory in Europe, and the nonpayment of the Allies' massive war debt, especially after the Depression began. The isolationists had no better spokesman than the heroic Lindbergh, already an intensely private man whose subsequent fame after his 1927 flight and the following horrific kidnapping and death of his son made him even more insular. Meanwhile, Franklin Roosevelt and many of his compatriots believed that if Great Britain fell, the United States was next on Hitler's plate.<br /><br />In the midst of the emotional battles between those wanting to stay away from Europe's dance of death and those who wished to fight the expanding sphere of Nazism, Olson gives us fascinating glimpses into the past: the British agency who operated covertly from Rockefeller Center to convince Americans that Great Britain was worth supporting; the Americans like Lindbergh and Ford who saw something different in German expansion; sensitive Anne Morrow, who married and loved Charles Lindbergh, but was increasingly alienated by him; the use of Hollywood films to show the effects of rising Nazism; the eugenics movement that underpinned \\"the final solution,\\" the appalling weakness of the American army right up to the day of Pearl Harbor. This is a sizable book, but one with a sweeping, appealing narrative that presents all sides of the arguments (and, in the end, notes a startling footnote to the life of Charles Lindbergh). A splendid, page turning read for those interested in history.saw something different in German expansion; sensitive Anne Morrow, who married and loved Charles Lindbergh, but was increasingly alienated by him; the use of Hollywood films to show the effects of rising Nazism; the eugenics movement that underpinned \\"the final solution,\\" the appalling weakness of the American army right up to the day of Pearl Harbor.

B00AUU2KI0|5.0|Life of Pi grabs you from the start and does not let go even long after the last page. This clutch changes with each chapter, each page, each breath and shifts your very perception of thought in a dizzying way. An epic tale, a philosophical allegory, and a beautiful work of art all at once, the story of a boy, a tiger, and a boat is compelling on a level you do not expect when you open the book. The simplicity is both alluring and daunting: this book will honestly change your life.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although as I began reading \\"Wool\\" I thought I would not enjoy this story of a dystopian society. I found that as I read more it became harder and harder to put down. By the end of my reading the Omnibus edition (Wool 1-5), I couldn't wait to read Wool VI. An easy to read, fascinating story with characters you care about. Time to start reading VI!
014241493X|3.0|I encourage my grandchildren to read. Because of your selection and the ease of buying, I purchase many books from you. I find that if there has been an error, and there have been a few, you promptly and efficient to correct it.

B007RX32XK|2.0|This music was an exercise in the pretentious and self-indulgent. Some very Interesting sounds and themes were toally wasted on sophmoric lyrics....
B003VANOFY|4.0|My husband uses these for Starcraft and likes them a lot. I use them every once and a while while I'm cleaning and it needs to be quiet. It's nice that they are wireless, but are a bit bulky for walking around. It does work on a mac for the basic sound (you have to change your sound preferences though), but not all of the functions. It's nice that when the microphone is up the sound mutes automatically. The only thing I don't like is that they are a pain to turn on and off. You have to hold the button down for like 2 seconds exactly or it doesn't work...more or less and it doen't work. I can't stand it...but it doesn't seem to bother my husband. Also, we just found out this technology uses the same frequency as the internet so sometimes the sound goes in and out for a second if there is too much stuff going on. Not that big deal though.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Playing this game is awesome because I like playing these kind of games and I am good at them hope you like this game.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I am picky about the type of country music I like, but I LOVE this album :) Got it for $5 too!
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I have seen Lethal Weapon one and two and now three, but have yet to see Lethal Weapon four. I will let you know.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game. Has been bothering me to get it for a few weeks and I finally gave in.
B00466HN6S|5.0|We had seen Hop at the show and now that we own it, it is the movie we'll watch every Easter.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'll start by saying I'm not a King fan.  I've read about a dozen of his books and most of them I didn't enjoy.  But the thing about King is, when he's got it.. He's got it.  For this book he brought his A game.  I couldn't put it down and read it in a marathon that I very rarely do.  Its a fantastic story with a well researched history.  The characters are extremely well developed and you are quickly pulled into their lives.<br /><br />The story itself is fairly tight and only meanders a little which is a lot to say for a King book of this size.  His other works always seem to take a very round about method of moving the plot along but this one was different.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I had heard it was a good movie and it really opened my eyes to how (I guess) professional sports are.
B005MP28B2|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen-too bad I spent money on it.  I'm sure there was meaning in it but it was too hard to understand.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I have seen all the Fast and Furious movies and wanted to start getting them to watch so this was th first one I purchased and it was Great.
1468179993|2.0|It is odd that the writer is so focused on how to deliver a great talk, yet he didn't seem to look for tips on writing an effective book.  The book is dry and seems to have been thrown together from a broad outline.<br /><br />He skips between very specific advice (number of words to use for a slogan) and broad advice (don't be boring).  There's little uniformity in how he presents his ideas, and the formatting of the book is not ideal, to say the least.<br /><br />Of course, the author should be commended for trying to put together this information and some of his direct-from-TED examples illustrate points well.  However, this is overshadowed by the dull nature of his writing style and lack of revelatory information.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|i choose this cd because i liked the basic story and that the price range was right for me . the cd arrived on time, in good condition and as advertised.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This application is an amazingly fun way to pass time. I recommend it to kids or adults of all ages.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I've been reading quite a few coming of age stories lately and this one was very good.  I like them because it's interesting to see characters find out about themselves.  If its done well, the reader also discovers something about him or herself.  The main character of this book, Colin, was written particularly well. He was believable while having a really unique and interesting point of view on life.  I really recommend it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Five stars! Love all of the elements, the drama with the staff, the family, and I especially like Violet. Awesome show!
B005HSL626|4.0|My son is primarily the one who plays this game and has enjoyed it.  He is 9 years old.  I would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. It is fast paced and runs very smoothly.<br />It has different challenges throughout the game.  Hard to stop playing<br />once you start.
B008602KQI|5.0|As a 43 year old man, I had no interest in reading a book written for teens, but as a movie and story in general, it was very well done.  Anyone wanting to watch a good movie would be well served to see this.  Everything was done nicely.<br /><br />My only issue, and this is true of all movies containing \\"teens\\" as main characters, is that they portray them as being much too adult-like.  I can still remember being a teen, and there is no way I ever had the courage, pride or integrity of any of these kids.  I can also say I have never met even a 20-something that would approach a situation this way.  But, that IS what makes it fantasy and I would never sit through a movie with real teens in it as that would be like babysitting.<br /><br />So, great movie!  Don't hesitate to watch.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but it needs different rewards.  Its also glitchy a lot. And things shouldn't cost so much.
0385349947|5.0|This book has become a worldwide phenomenon already. My wife is enjoying it.  I have shared several book reviews with her.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|It's a fun game, the gameplay is smooth and its addictive. However, I wanted a little more of a story. Still, that aside, its,a great match 3 game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a good story.  MUCH better than the Zero Dark Thirty movie.  This book tells the story by a guy who really lived it.<br /><br />To add:  Since the government manipulated and leaked the story to their benefit, I think this telling of a non-secret side of the story should be repeated again.  Even if the government didn't leak the details first, it was great to read this and see that it had zero sensitive material in it, but was still a good read.  I'm not some kind of expert on secret materials, but it seemed fine.
B000059POY|5.0|This much-maligned and vastly underrated French-Italian film, based on the satirical novel by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, is like no other film ever made. Despite some superficial resemblances to \\"Barbarella\\" and \\"The Magic Christian,\\" it truly stands on its own. The dialogue from Buck Henry's screenplay stays faithful to the novel and the film itself moves along, driven by its own irreverent, stylish momentum. In the title role, EwaAulin became a pop culture figure because of this one role. As the innocent, naive high school girl Candy Christian, she proved unequivocally could not portrayed the character in quite the same way she did. This esoteric late 1960s comedy also features appropriately esoteric performances by Richard Burton, James Coburn and Marlon Brando, among several others. Under the stylish direction of Christian Marquand, despite its inability to be truly appreciated in America, this unique film takes the viewer on a wild, swinging, almost chaotic journey that never lets up<br /> Highly recommended for fans of unique, stylish, satirical films of the late 1960s.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a fun story about the future. . .or possible future.  This is not a child's book.  I know that people are giving it to all the 12 year olds to read, but unless you want 12 year olds reading about children being gathered up to fight each other to the death for the entertainment of a supreme ruler.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing app, I haven't had any problems with the gameplay at all. I is definitely a must have application! Download NOW.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I was excited to see that Justin Hayward had released a new CD. I have loved his voice since the release of Days of Future Passed with the Moody Blues. His voice has held up very well as he has aged. This CD is proof of that. Some songs here are remakes of songs from previous CDs and they are good. He has taken a turn to Country Western music on this CD which may bother some people. Its not all twangy, but still has the CW sound. All I can say, is that while this CD is a bit of a departure from other CDs, its still Justin Hayward. Its pretty hard for him to sound bad!
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|COULD NOT EVEN PLAY THE GAME ON KINDLE FIRE! WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE TAP. WASTE OF TIME AND SPACE ON MY DEVICE
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|I had heard Riverside through Pandora and liked what I heard, so bought this CD when it came out. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, because several prog rock purchases as of late have been a little less impressive. So I put this in the player and started the experience. When the vocals started on the first song, I began to panic. The sound was a bit scratchy and a tad muffled, and I thought SURELY they have decent recording equipment in Poland! Then as the CD progressed, I found that it was intentional, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I continued listening, enjoying the Eastern European influences while still maintaining a good progressive sound. I made it through the first CD, enjoying it very much. Then moved on to the second. It turns out that the second CD is just instrumental music (well ok, there are a few vocals in the music, but no lyrics) and I found that I really liked it, even a bit more than the first CD. Overall, this set is great. I think, had I been in charge of organizing the order of the songs, I would have put the 2 instrumental pieces somewhere in between the other songs just to break it up a bit and give the whole collection a more Progressive sound,. Just my opinion. In the end, I really like this CD and I think you will find it very enjoyable. Riverside has a well developed sound and interesting approach.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|This game is a P.O.S., controls are awful, gameplay is boring and pointless. This is yet again another game company trying to force an endless runner down our throats..... why can't someone come up with a game that is entertaining and fun without it having to be an endless runner. The game has pixel graphics and a jet pack , these are the only reason the game is different from other runners. The power ups even managed to be boring and useless. Outfits are just dumb and are really actually very expensive. The in game gold is easy to get but hard in the long run to,actually compile a large sum of it unless you are playing for years. GIVE US GAMES THAT ARE NOT RUNNERS. This is my OPINION get it if it means that much to you but otherwise I highly doubt that I will be recommending this to anyone ever not even as a boredom purchase. If you get it I hope you don't have to experience the EPIC boredom that it will give you almost immediately upon hitting the RUN button.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When Google announced they were pulling the plug on Reader, I started looking for a replacement. Feedly was recommended in a couple of blogs so I gave it a try. I am very happy with Feedly. Having options on how my feeds are displayed is really neat. I am still fiddling with it, but am not looking at other readers. Feedly does a good job and looks great on my phone, my Fire, and my laptop. Love it!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|When I first saw this game I said &quot;Sure why not&quot; It was amazing how u can upgrade your sharks, Hidden objects,Daily Awards, Buy stuff &amp; more. I give it a 100%. Happy Gaming!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|compact container, blue ray, extras, all of the current films. I just wish we also could choose to watch the unedited versions that came out when I was a kid.
0061998885|4.0|I've always said that Dennis Lehane, even when he is not at his best, is still leaps and bounds above most of the other crime/thriller writers out there today.<br /><br />And \\"Prayers for Rain\\" once again provide ample support for this opinion.  This is a fact-paced, intricately plotted mystery that did not let up from the first page.  Sure some of the plot elements where a little too far-fetched to be believable - especially the concept of a villain as devious and powerful as the one portrayed in this book.  But when the entire story is weaved together with such skill, and when the book features characters as compelling and as likable as Patrick, Angie, and Bubba, you tend to forgive the little flaws and just focus on enjoying the ride.  What I especially like about Lehane's Kenzie and Gennaro mysteries is that the author never finds it necessary to shy away from difficult topics and is not afraid to explore the darker aspects of the human psyche; and even though Angie and Patrick are heroes representing the \\"good\\", they are not afraid to get their hands dirty to ensure that justice is served at the end.<br /><br />And Bubba...what can I say about Bubba?  Sure he is a psychotic killer and someone you wouldn't want to go near with a ten-foot pole in real life...but I love reading about him anyway.  Some of the scenes he has in this book is hilarious and provided it with some much needed levity amidst all the violence and darkness.<br /><br />A book I would highly recommend to anyone with a penchant for dark, gritty and violent crime thrillers.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is fun and fast moving.  I just installed it and have not had much time to play it. I love the fact that it is on my phone and it is touch screen game.  Just fun.
B00139B39E|4.0|When I first heard Dream Theater was going to put together a greatest hits package, I thought, \\"That's impossible because almost all their songs are good.\\"  I couldn't even imagine how they were going to pull this one off, but they did!<br />They put all the songs that in my opinion didn't fit well on their albums, it seemed as if every album had one extra song, but I was not conscious of this when I thought of what they would do for a greatest hits package.  Well, you may wonder how these songs all fit together; the answer is that the songs are more mild than most of the other stuff on their albums.  It was always as if Dream Theater always had a token slow song, and what's more they even released that song though usually it would get no attention for radio airplay.<br />Perhaps, I should have thought otherwise, but because I usually thought the released song was weaker than the rest of the album, it never occurred to me that they would put them all on 2 cds and repackage it.  As far as I know, this album, repackaging all the slow songs together ends up hitting the sonic spot on certain days, and is well worth listening to.  You just have to be in the mood for it.  Even for people that love the heaviest music, I imagine there can come a time when you feel like you need a rest.  Let me tell you, or even warn you, there are many musical rests about on this collection, as this is not the typical busy, hard hitting music I think of most when I think of Dream Theater.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I use this app with my 7&#34; tablet to keep up with reading across all devices. Very practical for business purposes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THis is a fairly simple game, but it is highly entertaining and fun to play. i would definitely suggest getting this game
B00913DPW2|2.0|No explanation, and worthless hints. The dreaded &#34;Nothing more to do here&#34; but nothing constructive. Where do you go when you get stuck?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the awesome game ever in the world! It is amazing. So try this app it will blow your mind.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Makes it easy to coordinate documents and books between my computer, tablet and Kindle. Eliminates paper copies and keeps sensitive documents secure.
B008VBYN80|2.0|it was good till i had to start begging for things from friends on Facebook in order to continue. I play games on my Kindle so I don't have to clutter my Facebook with these stupid requests.  uninstalled.
B0001I561E|2.0|it was sent as in good condition but it was it was dirty and plays bad freezing in different spots
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|it scared the s*** out of me!!!.....but I absolutlly LOVE this game because I love to get spooked! and if you do to then this is the app for you!!! :D
B0040I09RM|5.0|Haven't watch SOA before (I know I must live under a rock!) but I was hooked within minutes and can't wait to watch every episode!!!
0345529057|5.0|This is an amazingly well written and engrossing series.  For fans of Tolkien or Terry Goodkind, I strongly suggest this series.  The intricate plot lines and multitude of characters make the story that much better.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My grandchildren love this movie. They have watched this movie over and over in the last week. On the<br />good side it is a movie I don't mind watching with them.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|What can I say, this is the #1 CD and best ever in the world. Pink floyd is the best band ever
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This movie has a great story and is beautiful at the same time. It captures you right from the<br />beggining. It kept my three year old grandson's attention for the entire movie and that does not<br />usually happen.
0307408833|5.0|I love this work. When I found out 3 years ago I had celiac I thought that meant the end of anything tasty. Not true! This book is full of delicious recipes that even people without food allergies will love.
B0053TMP24|5.0|One of the best books ever , worth its price for sure. Worth $50 or maybe more awesome!!!! Don't let this book slip by you or you'll regret it
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Great insight insight what life is about. Great read for all.  It defines what love really is. I had it all wrong.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus, the book, is a marvel : whimsical, unexpected, utterly captivating. I enjoyed every moment. The Night Circus depicted within is also a marvel, a place I long to visit.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I was really turned off by the amount of nudity at beginning ~ almost did not continue watching.  After it got past that, it was a good movie.
B00999DFP0|4.0|What a riot!!!<br />This is a must for tv nuts who like comedy sit coms, #1 sit com<br />on the air, I hope to see me more of  this nutty funny comedy....
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The author takes you on the ride of your life. It's well thought out, well written and the plot keeps you on your toes. I had to finish it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|Disintegration (Deluxe Edition) (3CD) is the Cure's 8th studio album and is a pure gothic rock recording. My favorite  tracks are Lullaby, Lovesong, Fascination Street and Pictures of You. This deluxe edition which was compiled 2 extra CDS. The first extra CD contains RS Home Demo's, Band Demo's, Studio Rough and Rough Mixes. The third CD contains a full live show of the album. Truly an amazing recording. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this game onto my kindle fire HD and it is really high quality and smooth and addictive. I love it.
B000002HH9|4.0|Wild Mood Swings is the 10th studio album by the Cure and is a mix of Gothic Rock and Alternative Rock. Mint Car, Gone and Strange Attraction are my favorite tracks. The booklet contains all the lyrics and a small poster. Whilst it is not as good as prior releases it is still a very strong recording that I would recommend. 4/5.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|For some reason, my Kindle was not charging properly when connected to my computer. Amazon's customer service rep recommended that I charge it with the plug in charger and I have not had a problem since.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This movie was entertaining from the start....lots of people getting shot and gratuitous gore! LOVE IT....the storyline was very intriging so much so that I almost didn't realize that it was 2 hours and 45 min long.  I have always been a huge fan of Quentin's films since I saw Pulp Fiction way back when I was a teen, which is by the way my favorite movie EVER!  Definetly recommend this to everyone, well maybe not my mom but everyone else!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This one was 10x more bloody than the 90's version with Stallone. The bad guy is cool but not really bad enough in my opinion. Cinematography was rad. I don't think they're going to make anymore of these movies though because it bombed in the box office.
B00A83075M|5.0|We saw this in the theater and knew we would buy it when it came out. Cute story, funny moments, lots of action. The kids loved it!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Fun movie with references to oldskool games of the 80's and 90's. Your kids might not get some references, but they will like the character design. Pixar once again kicks butt.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|The kids love it, glad we got this one. It's great family entertainment. Love the animation and the story. A+++.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|If you've been unable to see the stage play this movie is a great alternative.. with just a few adjustments here 'n there in the song order and no singing of dialogue this is definitely a keeper.  Please go see the stage play when you can and enjoy this and all the great music to keep playing again and again!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these are really good games and real easy for even kids to pl&agrave;y. we always have fun playing. cant wait for some more games. i really like some are pdetty classic games.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I it very straight forward and seriously mastered movie. It was a very well thought out plan.  The lady knew what she wanted to be done.  She will be remembered as a compelling actress.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was always laying in my bed trying to gather money and unlock new characters.<br />The world tour was also very exciting.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I love Fuji's FP-3000B. It is fast, has great latitude, and quick to develop. Resulting images have beautiful tonal range and delicious blacks. I have been shooting for a long time and have made the circle back to analog. Planning a trip away from home and will most likely use my Polaroid 103 coupled with this film as my main shooter. I did have the same troubles with the paper tabs as one of the other reviewers, and it is likely an issue with the the pack's size. The issue was not enough to prevent me from purchasing the film again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is just like temple run but better you can actually buy new characters! I personally love subway suffers its the best version of temple run ever!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I learned a great deal about what must occur to be exceedingly successful. The author uses unique and varied examples to promote his hypothesis.This is a very clever book I am giving it as gifts to my reader friends.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is a MUST READ this is a great book for people who like action<br />I obviously really like this book
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I've been a fan of the LOTR since I read the books in 4th grade many years ago. The trilogy was great but this film is nothing more that a long drawn out revamped version of the same old story. It dragged for the first hour. I wanted so badly to turn it off. I'm disappointed in this film and would recommend to anyone who wants the real story to rent the 1977 animated movie The Hobbit or There and Back Again. Much better bang for your buck...and it doesn't leave you wondering how it ends.
B005K17RU0|2.0|the original was much better with easier navigation for the screens that one desired. the original had the screens right there instead of flipping around to find the right one.
B0067R0APK|2.0|You have put forward great effort on your graphs, but your radar is a joke. People count on accurate radar that can clearly tell where the storms are. The maps need to be up to the minute and a true picture of the action outside. Your maps look like you dropped globs of color on the screen. Spring is coming and along with it, storms. How can your maps help me? When you bring up the magnification it is blurred and useless.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|This movie was so well done-the story was powerful, the acting was great and the director did an amazing job. I could see why Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar.<br />Both she and Ewan McGregor were excellent. The children were wonderful as well.<br />Have some tissues close at hand because the story is so moving at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it sooooooooooooooo much solo much but I'm ti that good ya but every one needs to try it u can canect to facebook to see other peoples sccores
B00280LYIC|5.0|I bought this on a whim because it was a daily deal and I love young adult fiction. This book sucked me in and I ended up reading the whole series and started on the follow-up series, Heroes of Olympus. Definitely worth the read but if you enjoy this book do NOT watch the movie!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Littlest pet shop is the cutest game ever.  It's my favourite game of all my games on your device.  Wow!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I tried using it about twice and then just deleted it from my Kindle. I was hoping for a search that would be easy to use and I didn't get that.
B00C4QVQV0|5.0|this season was kinda boring but this is by far the best episode this season! I am hoping the next season will be better with more action.
B00914JWSW|4.0|I can't add anything to the other reviews except that I think Peter Matz was her best arranger.  The Matz tracks are the standout tracks on this cd.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun. Even if it's sometimes irritating when you have to wait for your horses energy to fill up.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Lots of fun for a tablet rpg. Great graphics and sound game play. Have been playing for a week now and still look forward to playing after work.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was wonderful ,truly captivating it kept me hanging it seemed that they would never get back to Kansas but in the end it all worked out
1451695195|4.0|It takes a bit to get interested, at the beginning.  But, the story picks up after the first chapter.  Most chapters are short, which makes getting through the book easier.  Afterlife wording a bit unique, but easy to follow.
1596680180|4.0|Instructions were mostly clear, photography is excellent.  My only problem is this book came up under a search for Kumihimo, which it definitely is not!  A good source for braiding techniques, but nothing to do with what I bought it for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a game like temple run. now I hats temple run. my favorit character is Lucy. I don't know but you might like it.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Fun to play, great way to fill up dead time.  Kids (especially little girls) will love it.  Engaging critter &quot;family.&quot;
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I give two stars for the amount of effort and money that went into the movie. Everything else; acting, cgi, etc. was awful.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This battery app has it all.  Great features like alarms,  graphs,  charts,  custome graphics, all for a small fee.  There is a free version with a few less features,  but the coder(s) deserve to be rewarded for the effort .  I tried it free first,  then decided to pay for the pro version.  I believe in the trial ware concept.  If you like it,  and plan to continue to use it,  then you need to buy it.  Worth every penny.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show if only season 4 came sooner. If I ever had the chance to meet anyone from the show my life would be complete. I am 14 and live in Washington if I was on the walking dead I would have the time of my life oh my gosh to be there to see the things I would fall in love. My favorite characters are Daryl and Carl :) love this show, again! Sometimes I think what if the zombie apocalypse would happen, then I think I know where I'm going, to someone from the walking fears house, but then I think beck it's just a tv show and I seriously don't think I'll never meet any of them so yeah, bye.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm pretty satisfied with this app it's simple but to the point and pretty accurate when I want to know what it's going to be like outside before I go I simply tap the icon and I can see for the next 5 days what it's gonna be like.it's like having my own personal weatherman lol...love it! &amp; it's free and the ads are so minimal until they don't exist
B009YP9L7U|4.0|When I began reading it.  Well it was boring but as I got further into it. Realized it was not bad.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|After deleting the Full Facebook Free app, I thought I'd try this one. After all, it's free and if I didn't like it I'd just delete it. Well, to my surprise it works quite nicely. It is almost the same as the normal Facebook mobile app from Facebook, but it's got some nice touches and does what it's supposed to do.
B009JBZH54|3.0|However there's no portuguese subtitle on the second movie, I know that's not the main language of the discs but if there are on the first and the third should have on all. So I was a little disappointed about it since I'm brazilian ^.^, anyway the rest is perfect as these movies can be
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire because  Facebook mobile was acting up, thinking I'd rid myself of the problems I'd been having. This app was slow, glitchy, and I ended up deleting it. I wouldn't bother with it if I were you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is a very nice game for kids to enjoy and have fun on their device either with friends or no friends
1250012570|5.0|Really fantastic, bittersweet tale of two teenagers who fall in love. This book should captivate teens and adults as well as it is one of the best depiction of teen love ever. I am not exaggerating. Either you are a teenager in the throes of teen love or you are an adult and you remember it all. It's all here , the good, the bad and the painful, without the \\"It's fate that we be together!\\" reason for falling in love that exists in so many books. This book makes it clear that we can't necessarily understand why we are attracted to someone even when we know what the little things are that make our blood rush. Love doesn't make sense. We say the wrong things without realizing we are doing it and immediately regret it. We think that the person we are attracted to can't possibly be attracted to us. But the two main characters' voices are so authentic. The longing and urgency you feel as a teenager and how the slightest touch becomes indelible is all here.<br /><br />Park's parents are a rarity in YA fiction. They have their issues with their son but they are a more or less happy family and incredibly supportive when the crisis of the book comes to a head. Just as Park is inspired by their relationship, so too is the reader.<br /><br />I have only two minor quibbles with the book. First, I was a junior in high school in 1986 as are the two main characters, and I don't know anyone who swore as much as these characters do. It's not that I have a huge problem with the language, but that it sound too 00s rather than the 80s. Secondly, as much as I enjoyed the 80s musical and cultural references, I felt that the choice of this time setting was made on purpose to get adults to connect to the story. In addition, I wonder if today's teens would get much of the jokes intended with these references.<br />flag
6304698798|5.0|This theatrical version cut some of the flab while still keeping it epic. Why they didn't include it on the blu-ray, I don't know. Oh well...
B005LJITS0|2.0|Blake Lively was the best part of this movie for me lol everything else was a little depressing I said it before and ill say it again , this to me was almost the same as the green hornet ryan reynolds and seth rogen both good actors but had horrible characters to play in these movies
B003VANOFY|3.0|To me, the headphones feel sturdy and well constructed.  The sound is as good as I need it to be.  The cups are reasonably comfortable, block out outside sounds well, and last me through many hours of gaming.<br /><br />But there are some nuisances, which might seem small, that I stumble upon every day.  It is worth noting that this isn't my only set of wireless head phones (let alone wired!).  I also have the Sennheiser HDR 120 which aren't as gamer worthy (no mic) but are still very good.  They sit on a stand when not in use, charging and ready for you.  You lift them off the stand, plop them on your head and off you go.  The simplicity of that effort emphasizes how irritating the startup process for the G930s is on an everyday basis.  The G930s will power down after a period of time (good?) but restarting them means holding a tiny power button for 8-10 seconds plus.  Then it takes another 10+ seconds before audio will start coming through them.<br /><br />I have to go through this process even when the headphones are plugged into a powered USB hub 24/7.  I have to go through this process every single time I go to sit down on the computer and my annoyance is growing.  I think yours will too.  If your comparison of this product to others comes down to the finish line, neck and neck, consider this minor detail.  I think you'll appreciate it in the long run.<br /><br />Incidentally, if Logitech releases an update to the software that addresses this issue, I would raise my score *hint hint Logitech*.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. It is so much fun and I love the world tour. I love how the new people and boards came with. But I had to start over once and so did my sister.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This used to be my favorite app. Not anymore. Worst upgrade ever.<br /><br />And these 5 -star ratings since the change?  Who knew you had that many employees?

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I am now addicted to this program.  I so enjoy being able to watch as much of it as I want according to my schedule.  Of course, like others, I was disapointed about the turn of events in the last episode.  But, it could not have been avoided do to actors involvement.<br /><br />I ran into a problem with the audio.  I was getting music or radio unrelated to the program.  I followed the amazon prompts to chat and was instructed to try another search engine.  This worked, the program restarted where I left off and there was no audio problems.
B0087HT36U|4.0|it lags a lot but it is a really cool game besides angry birds is cool 2 much 4 this game
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I liked it. I am moving onto the next one. Moments to leave you hanging and wanting more. I am interested to see what Riddley does next too!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|The performances in this series, especially from Bill Nighy, are outstanding.  The plot and the actors grab you and keep you keenly focused from start to finish.  Thanks again to the BBC for intelligent viewing. I just wish our American shows could be as good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had a few things to do inbetween reading this book, but I managed to get a few long 'setions'. And let me just say...it was bloody amazing! I loved it, from start to finish. One of the best books I've ever read. The arena...(I won't give anything away) but...yeah..it was really cool. The end! Sho! Brilliant! Can't wait to read the next and final book of the awesomely brilliant Hunger Games!!

1400069807|5.0|If this book was required reading in all high schools, we might put a dent in our bad eating habits.  I can't think of anything more important for a healthy mind-body-soul, then what we put in the engines of our body.  It seems to me that we care far more what kind of fuel we put in our cars, then our bodies.<br /><br />Michael Moss has written a food Bible.  This book is not an easy read because it's dense with information, though I found all of it fascinating.  What it all comes down to is money.  Big food companies take short cuts to aging things like cheese, and load up other foods with salt, sugar and fat to hit the 'bliss point' in our mouths.  Since these foods are empty calories, and our bodies know it, we crave more and more of them in our bodies' search for nutrition.<br /><br />Michael Moss has done his homework and then some.  I love the section on cheese, how we avoid whole milk, and drink our 'skinny lattes' yet dive right into full fat cheese without thinking about it.  But personally, I never avoid fats, whether it be butter, cheese, coconut oil, or olive oil and I've never been overweight.  Here's \\"Ulfert Broockman, a German-born expert who spent forty-seven years as a scientist in the dairy industry.  He did two five-year stints with Kraft, ending in 1984 . . .he said he won a substantial legal settlement from Kraft after being fired, which he attributed to his disgruntlement with the company's turn toward speedier cheese production . . . especially the increased use of enzymes to replace the aging process.\\" page 171<br /><br />Moss goes on to say that Brookman, who is in his early 70s, eats full-fat cheese for breakfast is tall fit and still capable of 100-mile bike rides.<br /><br />It should be criminal who companies use their vast researching abilities to market things like soft drinks to young kids.  Apparently, age 12 is when companies want to snare their young victims because this sets up brand loyalty.  Makes you wonder if the people working in the advertising capacity have young teens themselves.<br /><br />Moss' research is impeccable.  The last 60+ pages of the book are devoted to his sources.  I can't imagine how many books he must have read to write this one comprehensive study of our food and why were addicted to it.  It's almost as if we were having heroin advertised to us with a few vitamins on its back label.  Sugar is one of the most addicting foods on the planet, and the United States has the best advertising staffs in the world.  It's no wonder our obesity rates are out of control.<br /><br />And who knew that Betty Crocker wasn't a real person?  Just a pretty face invented by the advertising department of General Mills, someone to guide trusting housewives into taking the more convenient way of cooking, and the sad road to processed food.  \\"Crocker was invented to undermine the home-cooking skills of Betty Dickson and other home-economics teachers.\\" page 63<br /><br />This book should be read by anyone concerned with the health of their children.  See what's really in the food that is targeted at our children, and at ourselves.g in the advertising capacity have young teens themselves.<br /><br />Moss' research is impeccable.

B005NPCUC8|5.0|Amazon put the MP3 version of this CD on sale for $2.99. Of course I had to have it as part of my music collection.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm totally hooked.  Not quite halfway through.  Can't wait to see the movie, I hear it's very good too.  I will recommend it for book club definitely!
B00138KE5Y|5.0|Amazon put the MP3 version of this CD on sale for $2.99. Of course I had to have it as part of my music collection.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I enjoyed this &#34;dark&#34; period piece.  Though a little slow paced, it was unique and ultimately was pleasing.....you should like it too...
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has everything you want and is easy to use. The live radar and the news video for each area is also helpful. I like the fact that you can have multiple areas and this app displays all of them on one page.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel was great, the idea surrounding the plot was incredible, who would have thought!!<br />John Goodman was awesome, his character helped to keep the movie in that &#34;special&#34; place between farce and reality!!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Tender, heartbreaking, educational.  A testimony to the human spirit to triumph.  A great tool for young people to learn to look beyond the obvious.  I volunteered at an elementary school book club where Wonder was the book.  After only a few pages, I had to know how it ended so I purchased the book.  Fine reading for any age.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I really like this moive because it's love in is't essence: lover's love, friend's love, siblings' love, impossible loves, platonic loves, interracial love and all in all is not cliche or cheesy
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer has many twists and turns.  It keeps you in suspense and eager to know what happens next.  Although I strongly suspected the connection, the ending was still a good surprise.  Terrific!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am amazed that this is considered juvenile lit.; very mature themes explored with depth of insight.  It left me thinking for days about the nature of war and how we sacrifice our youth to our decadence.  It does help to bring home the fact that the taking of a life always scars the taker.  It is a cautionary tale to young extremest that you never do know who and how you may be being used.  Excellent reading for adults should be mandatory for adolescents.
0061950726|5.0|I love historical fiction.  Orphan Train is an extraordinary  book that takes the reader on a journey through the life of an Orphan Train rider with all the joys, pitfalls and heartbreaks of the train trip and subsequent life found by the children.  The story is relived by one of the riders and told to a troubled youth currently in foster care performing community service.  Although many years separate the two, they find their circumstances very similar.  Can a trip down memory lane help each other heal?<br /><br />The characters are well developed and the story believable.  An outstanding book that tugs at the heartstrings. I couldn't put it down until finished and then I still wanted it to continue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game. Challenging enough to make it exciting but not too hard. Three daughters enjoy it as well as their daddy.  Youngest daughter said its awesome!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I would like to see the movie more true to the book. ie. Kat's sister was not the one who gave her the Mockingjay pin.
B000JMKO0A|3.0|The English translation is okay and makes the book a little slow in the beginning.  Too much unimportant story line.  However , all that nonsense is worth it for the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an amazing game and very addictive. It is a really cool game and it is amazing how it costs nothing. I recommend this to anyone who liked Temple Run or just likes a fun game. :D
B001YV502C|5.0|\\"Children of Men\\" is a sobering \\"what if\\" sci-fi story, where for reasons unknown, women have become infertile. It's  2027 and no child has been born for 18 years.<br /><br />What is left of the  civilized world has become increasingly fragmented, and in Britain, the government makes  antidepressants and 'suicide kits'  equally available. Non citizens are rounded up and shipped off to huge refugee camps that look nightmarishly familiar.<br /><br />Just as the human race seems destined for extinction, a new hope arises, and it falls on the shoulders of an unlikely hero to  shepherd that hope out of the chaos and into a safe haven.<br /><br />This movie  may be depressing to watch, but it is well cast, well acted, and  beautifully designed and shot. Many of the scenes are shot without cuts or fades, and there is one scene that  is shot from the perspective of passengers inside a small vehicle that is amazing (watch the bonus features to see how it was done). Honestly, \\"Children of Men\\" should be required viewing for students of film.<br /><br />This film looks incredible in high-def. If you are a fan, it's well worth the upgrade from DVD.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app definitely saves me time and I love the new swype because that really saves time typing! Thnx for making it
1568363931|5.0|Makiko Itoh's book is well thought out. She's very good at teaching cooking, breaking done each recipe into simple steps and giving colored photos to explain how to do the more complicated dishes like Tamagoyaki, an omelet rolled into a rectangle shape. I have already tried several recipes and love them. Even her advice on cooking rice has made difference. My rice taste much better now with the addition of a few easy steps.<br />  If your interested in Japanese food I highly recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this app a while ago and I love playing it! This game is so much fun. I suggest that you get this app. You will be a lot happier if you did.
B009MO5960|5.0|can't wait for the other part to come out in dvd love the movie action is great horror sci-fic love all the movies
1616550414|5.0|Finally I understand. Ive played mostly all the Zelda games and well trying to figure out the timeline was a headache, not any more!
B00887490Y|3.0|this movie is great for who done it movie i like it i love that the movie is clear and its good
B0072OFOM6|5.0|So far the series has not trailed off ( a legit concern with any series) but made a good addition. IF YOU LIKE ANY OTHER SPARTACUS SEASON, YOU LIKE LIKE THIS ONE (spoiler alert*) You will mourn for a bit at the replacement of a few characters, i thought i would warm up to the new guy but even after finishing the season this he just doesn't quite live up to Andy Whitfield. And damn you nevea ...  i would of loved to see all of that emotion from the original.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My sister brought her little minion, Kevin, to a family gathering--should I mention that she is long out of high school--and we thought he was really cute. I had never seen the movie and knew little about it, but she assured me that we too would want a minion of our own after seeing the movie. She was right! It's a very warm, sweet movie with lots of fun digs throughout. My only complaint with the movie was that the volume of the download was very low. I really wanted some closed-captioning to help me not miss the clever dialogue, but we couldn't access that. However, if you want a fun movie that anyone can enjoy, this is it. The little girls in the movie were just adorable--and yes, I wouldn't mind having a  little minion of my own.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Lots of MMA action plus a great story, with some great eye candy (lots of muscular guys with their shirts off.  Nice!).  Highly recommend for adults
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series.  We watched season 3 in 2 days. I loved knowing the ending before my neighbors and friends.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Excellent series.  The best of the bunch in my opinion.  Storyline is ingenious and keeps you guessing.  I hope they continue to make these films.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If  you grew up in the 1980s or you are a gamer who has played many of the classics, back when games had real play-ability and real challenges, this book is for you! It's fun and exciting, you won't want to put it down!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I am happy that Jackson is making a Hobbit movie in the same exceptional manner of the Rings trilogy.  The Hobbit is an excellent story and it feels like he is not going to leave much out.  This is the first half of the story.  Anticipating the sequel!
0761158820|5.0|I purchased this book at the Pompidou Center in Paris for my kids when I was visiting France. They only had the version written in French, but I bought it anyway to help us with our language skills. Turns out it is so easy that we didn't need to use our french, but have had such a fun time over my boys rainy spring break that I want more! I don't know who likes making these the most, me or my 7 and 10 year olds. I do say that the glue dots are essential; they would be terribly frustrating to put together with regular glue! Don't hesitate to buy if you want a fun activity to do with girls or boys of all ages!
0312588887|5.0|I first read this book years ago and I let someone borrow it never got it back.  This is probably the best book I ever read a story of women in power doesn't get any better than that
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Though I feel it would have been better served as a TV Movie it was good entertainment and wothe watching.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I click on my list for my friends and it shows half of them. I try and scroll down and my page goes and splits into parts of the same thing. It is a good app but it has bugs. Please fix it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was a test to see how it worked. So far it looked like it worked fine.  I will likely order additional items to view.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive once you start playing it is hard to put down. I saw someone playing it at work and decided. to try it and I am glad I did. You will too. Enjoy
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I absolutely loved this book! The reason I only give it 4 stars  is because it was slow at points and had a lot of confusing speech but there is not much of it. I definitely recommend this book. And if you haven't read White Fang, do so A.S.A.P!
B000AP04OM|5.0|My father loved to listen to this movie, my father listened to this every day till his passing many thanks
B004YF6MHW|4.0|EASY TO USE - DOES WHAT IT SAYS IN THE INSTRUCTION AREA - STILL NEED TO USE MORE TO GET A GOOD HANDLE ON LINE
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love all the new songs by Blake have only played the cd 1 time so far so hope to hear more soon
B009AMANBA|3.0|I just received this and have not watched it yet, but I want it out of my review box. Perhaps they don't need to send reviews out so quickly that can skew the data. A month after purchase would be a more accurate time frame.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love the books by Hugh Howey. His writing places you there and the books run like a movie in your mind.
B008P9M614|5.0|When I watched House on tv there were often scenes that I closed my eyes for. Having purchased the season series I find myself still getting rather tense at scenes and becoming unsettled. It scares me to think what decisions the medical profession has to make on us every day. There is still so much not known about how it works, but if I ever get a quirky disease, I want a &#34;House&#34; to be my doctor.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Fun to stay connected this way with friends and family.  Pictures can be drawn by all ages.  Artistic skills not necessary!
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Being a Fan of the orginal ,I rate the new film 4 /5.<br />Iam thr glad the music stayed true.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I had seen it in the theatre when it first came out and loved it.  Watched it for second time with my husband, who has not read any of the books.  I picked up on things I didn't the first time and liked it even more.  My husband liked it and thought it was well done, too.  The film makers  did a good job of following the book.
B0097HSS4M|2.0|Not much to this app! Not worth the purchase for me. My iPhone can do a lot of what this offered.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Very inspiring true account of Wilberforce's (and others) efforts to cripple, then destroy the slave trade. Although the director took artistic licence in mixing-up the order of some of the historic events, it accurately conveys the true power of persevering faith in God--even in the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition. I highly recommend it!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Like the actors and the scenery. They have changed history but hey, it is a TV series. Glad it is available on Prime!
B00000JPH6|5.0|Has always been one of my favorite movies from when I was a kid! Love Love Love Jim Henson & Frank Oz! My child loved Chamberlain's character and the &#34;throat&#34; hmmmm noise he makes!  If you like The Last Unicorn, The Hobbitt (the original animated version), then you'll love this!!!
B004UID2LC|2.0|I hate that you can't search a video you have to download the video it gives you and it picks the video for you
0345803493|5.0|This has to be my fav of all 3 books! You get a deeper look into Mr. Christian Grey and his past. This one starts off a little slow, but soon picks up some speed!!! Another \\"can't put it down, just one more chapter before bed!\\" books!! Had this one read in about 2 days. My just another chapter turned into another 3 or 4 chapters! LOL enjoy!
B00456H5LC|5.0|This is a great album that shows the range of Bruno Mars.  I listened to it once and bought my own copy.
0345803507|5.0|What can one say who has read these books???!!! Makes you wonder if a man like Christian Grey really exists!!! My fave of the 3 books is the second book. You dig your heels in real good in the first one, but the second book just \\"cements\\" you! The plot twist in the last book.....OMG!!! Who would have guessed!!??!! Alot of people have already read these books, but if you haven't then you really should!!! Definately worth a second read, as well!! How many books make you WANT to read them a second time?! Now if you offend extremely easily, then I don't recommend that you read these books. They give very specific details of certain adult situations and can almost be used as a manual!! However, what I wouldn't give for just one night in the red room!! LOL
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Great movie, love Clooney, as stated we plan to watch again, viewed this over 6 months ago so a bit hazy.
6305428050|4.0|This was a movie from back in my day! Still funny and loved hearing my child laugh along with me! Great family movie and value!! Also great for a trip down memory lane for those of us who remember this movie. :-)
0790731452|3.0|Somewhat entertaining if there was nothing else to view, some good parts but overall would not recommend it to others
0345803485|5.0|Ok, so I've seen alot of bad reviews about this book but I love it! Call me crazy, but this was my first erotic romance book. Some of the characters may seem \\"too real to be true\\" , but HELLO!!!....this is a BOOK! The author has every right to develop his/her characters as they so choose. Noone says you have to read it...oh wait, yeah they do!!! LOL At least those of us who enjoy something of this nature. It's nice to dig into a good book no matter the genre and \\"escape\\"! Christian surprised me when he went to the hardware store Ana works just to see her!! And at the end of the 3rd book, you get a small preview of what seems to be a rewrite of at least the 1st book in Christian's side. And if you read at least the 1st book, you may just do what I did and laugh because you would have NEVER thought that Mr. Christian Grey to be the apprehensive type!! He seems to be a rather bold, cut to the chase guy. Oh well, I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read these books. Read them for yourself and decide. If you like them, great! If you don't, then turn around, sell them, and don't look back.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|Love Michael Connelly's books but the movie was a far cry in comparison,McConnagy was good, but overall very average, The End
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am on everyday every second I love! Gives you many things to help with ur everyday style and many tips on how to do things!
B001OQCV6A|3.0|Did not watch this DVD, but did view it in France @ our Daughters, entertaining but would not watch again
B008YI91HS|5.0|The DVD arrived in perfect condition. i bought it as a tool in teaching my Biology students about genetics, cloning, dinosaurs and evolution.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Have seen this movie @ least 3 times, and will watch again, love the entire cast, classic movie. this DVD worked well
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved watching shows with historic backgrounds. This one is convincing and beautifully made.  The riches of the household is not overwhelming and aged to showed that they are a collection that's inherited through generations, and not so much acquired through purchase.  I also love that they repeat their wardrobes, instead of always wearing different outfits, as that would not be how it was.
B004A8ZX28|1.0|We just watched for the 1st time 2 days ago, about 1/2 way thru, the dvd hangs up and will not play?<br />I<br />We liked what we saw of it, HOW DO WE RCV ANOTHER DVD?
B005LBF7CY|5.0|I loved this book from Danielle Steel. Another well written story of love, heartbreak, family and happy endings. A must read.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie, acting, directing, and scenery was first rate, to sad that the ending was not more upbeat
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Bfzjdhuzgfhjkzfvkhzfkjhxvfhbbhvjzffnbvzhbjvjvhzdvbvjfzvjbzfhvhkzvfukvrsfvjhzfrvkhfdzjvhzfrfvjhzr sjdkcbbkjrscgkjfhzcdzkjhjkvzfkjhdc THIS IS SO AWESOME! This game is cool, and plus, it develops &quot;hand-eye correction&quot; This is solo cool and awesome!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Puzzles are good, music becomes irritating.  Progression should include level of difficulty. Could include a greater variety of puzzle layout.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Is great I love it and it is no money if you agree leave a good review!<br />I love this game
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Honestly, I couldn't bear to hear most of the DVD.  I could not believe how horrid the music was and it actually became painful to listen to.  With that said, the cinematography was very nicely done and the costumes were wonderful, but unfortunately the music quality was just not there and this film is a poor representation of the numerous live stage productions that I have seen in the past.  :(
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I have ever heard of! But there r so many copycats of this awesome game. I love u moaning!!! U r so awesome !
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|very fun and very addicting game, works great. no problems so far, i hope everybody else is enjoying this game!
0451219597|5.0|I hate to admit it but prior to May 2009, I was not aware of Ken Follett.  I had heard of the book, 'Eye of the Needle' but had not read it or seen the movie.  In May 2009, we were on board our yacht, 'Sunboy' and were berthed at the Cowes Yacht Club on the Isle of Wight in England.  There is a wonderful second hand book shop in Cowes, simply called 'That Shop' We were preparing our yacht to set sail for who knows where.  To help entertain ourselves on our journey, we bought boxes and boxes of second hand novels.  Along the way, we would randomly pick out a book and start reading.  Jackdaws was once of the first I read on our trip.  I was saddened.  Saddened that I had not discovered this author before.  Jackdaws is a gripping yarn that I struggled to control the speed at which I wanted to turn the pages.  The ability of the author to create his characters, allowing you to identify them and with them is brilliant.  The scenes he paints with words are like watching them on a big screen right there in front of you, they are so lifelike, almost in 3D. I recall actually sitting there at times and holding my breath due to the tension he builds.  A quest started.  A quest lasting all through our journey, sailing 16,000 nautical miles back to Australia - Find Ken Follett's books.  Searching every second hand bookstore, fellow yachties book collections, island book swaps, remote yacht clubhouses, anywhere we thought there could be a slight chance of finding one.  Finding a Ken Follett book we had not read was a cause for great celebration.  Everyone on board had fallen in love with the writing of this author.  Such a wondrous way to pass the time sailing across the oceans, perched up in the cockpit or snuggled up in your bunk, a Ken Follett book on your lap and a steaming hot cuppa in your hands.  I could apply this review to all of his books.  I need the time to do other things though; as I reach for my latest addition to my collection, Winter of the World.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|They are so talented & it shows!  Contemporary, but not too!  Formal musians but not stuffy music!  You can feel the passion and love they put into their music!  Gotta love Alex Boye' - definitely watch the video version of &#34;Peponi&#34; online.  Thanks for the great music Guys!!!!!
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This is an excellent RPG for mobile devices. It has great visuals, easy controls, and good replay-ability. My only gripe with this game is that the story is way too short. Only took me a few hours to complete. And there aren't many side-quests which makes the replay-ability low, but if you miss a few then you may want to go back and replay them. Other than that its worth the price. Keep up the good work Crescent Moon; expecting more great RPG's.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I tend to put off watching Christian movies because they are almost always so amateurish they are painful to watch. Not so with Courageous. This is a great story; you'll laugh, you'll cry - and if you're a parent (especially a father), you'll be inspired. Buy this movie. Watch it. It's good stuff.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is excellent. It has a great art style, great replay value, great level design, and just has that nostalgic feel from the side scrollers from the NES and SNES days. While some people hat the cutsie art style i enjoy it. Its bright, colorful, and actually gives you something to look at rather than just going through a level with a one color background. And for the price on the amazon appstore its a steal because on google play, as of 4/5/13, its $2.99. Another great game from Crescent Moon Games.
1400069289|1.0|This book is not at all what it purports to be. It's a series of stories on how habits have impacted individuals, football teams and or businesses. But what isn't made clear is the details on habits. What is a habit? How to identify the important cues? How to replace them with something else? How to identify and then implement a keystone habit? It's interesting stories but it isn't at all helpful in terms of helping to move forward in creating positive habits; replacing negative habits with an alternative habit; identifying and implementing keystone habits in the workplace etc. It's thought provoking- but absent a significant amount of additional investment by the reader in further research and though it's just a nice story book.
B003O5MOE8|5.0|It's been years since I'd heard &#34;the fever&#34; and it's just as incredible as I remember it.  the other tracks are fine, too.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|My wife had to find a replacement for How I met your Mother since she exhausted all the episodes on Netflix. But we had to start from the beginning. Very funny.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl by gillian Flynn.  this was the strangest but most brilliantly written novel I have read in a long time. I can see why it's been on the best seller list for so long.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Two story lines weave together to tell of a transformational journey. Easy predictions of what is to come are irrelevant as the depths of the story churn, taking the mind overboard, willingly surrendered to that which transcends the senses.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This WAS another great Harry Bosch adventure , made all the more so by being about his past and solving his mother's murder.  Many twists and turns but always interesting; did not see the ending  coming.........I especially love Michael Connelly's  writing style........fully detailing each character and event.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just love. Could not put this book down. I had been kind of &#34;over&#34; Nicholas Sparks.. Same story, different characters, but this book cured that.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Wonderful music.  Gabriel's oboe is hauntingly beautiful.  This was my first encounter with Morricone's music and it won't be my last.
0756405890|5.0|With the over-saturation and overall abundance of new books being published nowadays, it's a rare case to find one that you would keep coming back to and continue to enjoy. For me, \\"Name of the Wind\\" is such a case. I read it for the first time after it had been published for a few months and have revisited it three times since. I have yet to be bored from one of my readings, or find overwhelming flaws that turn me away. It truly is a great work of fantasy that is superbly written and sincerely relatable, and there are many things about the book that make it one of my favorites.<br /><br />First and foremost, the premise behind the story is intriguing; our hero Kvothe has accomplished feats and lived a life that has turned him into a legend. For reasons unknown, he has changed his identity to that of Kote, a lowly yet friendly innkeeper in a remote corner of the world. Kote is content with his quiet life until Chronicler, a scribe and rumor debunker appears at his inn. Chronicler, responding to rumors of Kvothe's whereabouts, confronts the innkeeper and eventually obtains permission to write Kvothe's story, word for word. \\"The Name of the Wind\\", the first in a proposed trilogy, is the first of three days it will take Kvothe to tell his story to Chronicler. Throughout the rest of the book, the story is from the point of view of Kvothe as he relives the stories that turned him into a legend.<br /><br />Additionally, the magic system, known as sympathy, is equally intriguing. Though still a work of fantasy, the workings of magic in this book have a more realistic feel, and depend on principles of alchemy, chemistry, and biology to work correctly. The majority of what we learn about sympathy comes form the University, the place where Kvothe eventually winds up to learn more about the elusive and mysterious Chandrian. The system Rothfuss has created is complex and fascinating, and makes for some great scenes in which Kvothe must think quickly on his feet.<br /><br />I'm also a huge fan of Rothfuss' writing style. He knows what it's like to be young, especially when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex, and his style really reflects that of someone telling their story to a third party. His metaphors are beautifully written and the book never waivers to being overly-descriptive or boring.<br /><br />This really is a great book if your a fan of fantasy or even fiction for that matter. I'll even make this a tease by saying that as great as this book is, the following installment in the trilogy \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\", is even better. Highly, highly recommended.also a huge fan of Rothfuss' writing style.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Star Trek classics on Blu-Ray. GoldBox Deal. Enough said.<br /><br />Really though; the quality of the video is not the best I have seen but it's still great. It's definitely high definition. I don't know too much about video quality to provide a technical review. I simply know that it was a Star Trek Blu-Ray collection for $35 dollars.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I only really needed the blu rays. But, for the price it totally made sense to purchase this collection. Very convenient.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|You know the movies. They're classics. If you don't know them, go read some other review. I'm here to perpetuate the five star ratings with my own. Gold Box deal, classic movies. Love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and appropriate for all ages!! I especially like the holiday additions!! I also love that the app was<br /> FREE!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This plot line was very Sparksish which means AMAZING to me!  I couldn't stop reading and look forward to seeing the movie.
1451695187|3.0|It is a decent book but it just doesn't hit me in the gut like some books that I read.  A highly intelligent writer like Dr. Eben seems to have a difficult time writing on a non technical level, but I appreciate his sincerity and know his experience was significant since he was not a believer in matters outside the scientific realm, but now he is.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Came in great condition no problems. Shipped right on time... Great movie very funny. I would recommend this as a perfect family movie
B009MO5E10|4.0|I seldom give 4 stars<br />Some people say the plot is thin<br />For me, I like the stubborn determination of the law-school dropout: which shows an understanding of the drop-out mentality<br /><br />Good casting - what I don't like is using the clock to go backwards and forwards<br />Very trendy now, but for me, when I watch a show, I don't want to have to keep track of these things<br />As it is, my mind's already working overtime on how a guy with cracked ribs in an ambulance is allowed not to go to the hospital<br /><br />My quibbles:<br />a. stealing that Jerry della Famina (Mad Men) 'most fun you can have with your clothes on' line<br />b. there'll probably be a sequel, which'll suck<br /><br />Like:<br />that the Chinese chick in this show is relevant - she's there for a purpose, other than catering to the China market
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I saw the original (yes black and white) Dr. Who, and when this came available I couldn't wait.  This actor adds enthusiasm, intelligence, and wisdom of the role with panache.
B00933JF74|5.0|I love that this game doesn't require you to ask for favors from your friends.  It's continuous play at your fingertips.  I wish there were more levels but it was well worth the price to buy this app.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|My son is autistic and doesn't ask for much.  He requested Captain America and haven't heard that he doesn't like it, so I know it's a winner with him.  Thanks for making my son happy.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I hadn't read the book and knew only about the adrift at sea part.  And I'm glad I didn't know anything more before watching.  I don't want to give away anything so I'll just say that the storyline, the colors, and especially the imagery were outstanding.  I watched this with an 8 year old and a 13 year old.  The beginning is quite wordy and they were getting a bit restless.  However, once the sailing began, interest picked up and we were all mesmerized to the end.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have read all year. Renting is not enough, its one that should be purchased for the at home collection. Ben Affleck's career is back.
B008OOYALE|3.0|It's a really fun game in my opinion! One of my problems is that things in the game cost expensive really fast, and I don't have real money to throw away on something so silly. The other problem is that they have quests that you can only complete with gems. Like buying their special season dragons. But hey, the app is free and they need to make money somehow! I recommend this if you have patience and love the silly little games like this. I highly recommended this if you like to play Dragon City on Facebook!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I adore good design and product integrity. I love products that are game changers and those that deliver life improvements. Clearly, Steve was a master of pushing the established channels of distribution and of design. The author does a great job exploring the darker side of his life. Sad to learn about his callousness and lack of compassion especially for those who really helped him make it. For those of us who enjoy tech and invest, Gr8 job by the team who wrote it. Highly recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has always been a good game. Seems much easier on the electronic devices than when playing with cards. Are there other versions of solitaire for the electronic.devices?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun and is different ever time when they change the tour. I think that anytime of people would love this game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun game if you like controlling everything. I definitely recommend this game. Very addictive but way better than the Sims
B001BANK32|5.0|Now I know why this book was a classic! Exceptional story by King. Can't wait to read the sequel Dr. Sleep
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Excellent game and very addictive. Must for anyone who has a tablet. I absolutely love this game, regular updates are really good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway servers is the best game ever !!!!!!please don't stop playing subway servers! !!! Lets make it as populor as we can! !!!!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is a very fun ghost story.  Daniel R. is very believable with this character. Excellent cast. I loved watching this movie because I love a good ghost story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like if you<br /><br /> have WiFi you can get I and I like that every once in a while it changes to different parts of the world that's cool!!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this often to keep a log of when I need to drain and recharge my battery.  Very nice and easy to use.
B007HGPBRC|3.0|If you are a widow or a widower this book repeats the experiences that your loved one went through. The last chapter describes what you will be going through.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I think anything after her first blockbuster would be a letdown, but this book is definitely worth reading.  It is &#34;dark&#34;.  Not a cheerful read at all, but she writes so well she just leads you down the reading road!
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Waited till I played game for awhile. Had 5 quests and every single animal you had to use  peanuts(which you buy with real money) and not the first  one and hunt down others no both of them.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Wish I had seen this series live on network, but better late than never. Enjoy the flow of stories and evolution of characters.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best book of the entire series. If your a fan of Game of Thrones and don't want to wait for the HBO series, then this is the book for you. Picks up at the start of season 3.
B008DVKTLI|5.0|This is a great packaged deal!!! Get the vinyl album plus the cd version.!<br /><br />I heard Toy for the first time at a live show in the Twin Cities. The venue was playing their single \\"Left Myself Behind\\" between band sets. I liked what I heard: a mixture of The Cure, Joy Division, A Clockwork Orange and the psychedelic sounds of the 60s-70s.<br /><br />The next day I impulsively bought the vinyl album. In about a week it arrived at my local post office. To my surprise I realized \\"Left Myself Behind\\" was a single not featured on this Toy record!. However, this didnt stop me from enjoying the album and discovering other songs I like.<br /><br />To make matters better you can sign up to be on Toy's email list and get the \\"Left Myself Behind\\" single as an mp3 download. So things worked out in the end I have a great album with several excellent sounding tracks plus two free tracks I can enjoy in mp3 format until I buy the viny version.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Excellent read.<br />Easy to read, easy to understand and follow, and believable. Exciting finish. Go read this book!
0761171703|4.0|Professional dancers. Still exciting! Sometimes repetitive leaps and back bends but I didn't mind.  Pics well done structure wise. Thanks.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was a mystery I could not put down but I did not like it when she changed maganas for his love able self
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Very Bill Murray movie. Totally quirky and unexpected. I love the scenery and want  to visit there.The kids (most of the actors) were delightful and the stars of the movie.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|When I purchased this app I thought this was going to be a very easy game for me to play but after the first round I was very much surprised. This little guy whose driving a dune buggy really knows how to fly!  I didn't make it through the first round.  I had to get use to the rapid speed the car I was driving - was doing. Their are obstickles- bridges- trees- sheds-and winding roads that lead into dark tunnels.I trully am enjoying this fun challenging game. Try. it - I think you'll like it!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Like the first season, watched it straight thru, practically.  A wonderful story with many characters and fantastic scenery. Everybody I know who saw it loves it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one fantastic and exciting game. I can't put this game down for a minute- I want to be a winner at this! If you like fast.  action games- then you'll really love this one for sure.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is really addicting. Fun to keep you busy when you get bored. My daughter especially loves playing with all the different characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think u r kind of scamming off temple run sorry just how it seemes sorry again just not right
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Hard not to imagine Castle as Rook and Kate as Nikki. Its as good as the tv show. I wouldn't be surprised to see this as an episode.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Recommended for anyone living in the past, fiction or unhappiness. Walk with Wilson through Paris and eras of our ancestors to rediscover the beauty of today and what it means to be in love.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This show is amazing, I think that goes without saying... but expensive! I found it brand new (sealed no less!) on Ebay for $22!! Might be worth a look!?
B0064QNS62|1.0|Did not like this game reminded me of Mario bros don't like games like this...removed it front device. No good no d<br />Good
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An amazing game. Perfect for the family and is guaranteed to have hours of fun. Theme changes regularly. Currently in Sydney.
0385536828|3.0|I did not enjoy the book that much.  Terribly 'wordy' and disjointed at times. I plowed thru it though as it was a book of the month for my Book Club and I wanted to be able to join in with our discussion.  My interest was somewhat peaked toward the end as I did want to know the outcome of Tom and Serena..
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery Manor is quite fun. I find the levels challenging &amp; intertaining. Would recommend for every age group. Thank you, Game Insight
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fantastic book! 853 pages and I wish there was more. Fascinating account of what might happen if we really could travel back in time.
B001HN694K|5.0|Johnny Depp is an all time favorite of mine. He is quite possibly the most versatile actor ever. Seeing this version of Alice in Wonderland was, and is, a complete entertainment experience.
B001223BLU|5.0|If you listened to the radio in the 60's, you'll remember all of these classic 4 Seasons hits.  Most of these are incorporated into the Jersey Boys on Broadway - which is a great musical.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like how this author writes. I started with The Lincoln Lawyer series. Now, this Bosch series makes me enjoy Connelly's writing.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|A must-have for anyone that loves 70's - 80's light rock. Every track is memorable. Buy this, or &#34;go your own way.&#34;
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I like that you don't loose lives if you can't finish the puzzle.  You just try again!  These are my favorite types of games.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|It's interesting how in recent years artists we'd call &#34;classic rockers&#34; are recording albums that show they still have a strong vision and creative energy. Gang of Four and DEVO have in recent years come back incredibly strong and now David Bowie shows that he's still got the fire in the belly and the creative vision. This is not just a musical memoir. It's a great album in its own right.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie with a wonderful story and great characters. my kids loved it so much we watched a couple of more times(I usually don't do that)
B005LAJ212|2.0|Caution, Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />As is, unfortunately, so often the case these days, the need to carry over a show into season 2 (and possibly further seasons) trumps all other considerations.<br />Revenge starts out with a neat storyline, it has a solid cast, keeps you on the edge of your seat and provides enjoyable TV entertainment.<br />Then comes the point - after the producers have ensured the continuation of the show into the next season - where it becomes more and more obvious that now<br />the primary directive is: keep the show going! Plots get thin, the story branches out in pointless directions and then culminates in a \\"climax\\" that is so beyond logic or common sense<br />that one wonders if it has turned into a fantasy/sci-fi drama. The nice SEC agent finally gets his hands on the incriminating evidence, harddrives and everything. He gets to watch all of it in their federal offices so he knows it'll be enough to bring down the villain on a murder charge. But wait! All the evidence is loaded on a plane and the plane explodes. All the evidence is lost. The only guy who made<br />a copy is the heroine's side-kick. Not the people at the SEC, no. Why would they? It would only have been their case of the century.<br />It leaves me wondering if they think we're too stupid to notice or too much in love with their show to care.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is much better than the normal game. I like upgrading the sharks and there are lots of places to explore.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is very cute. I love the dream music they have for it! And going through the maze the get to his bed is a fun challenge. I gotten this game on a day it was free, but now u have to pay. I think it's worth it. :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game because it's like going to the fair any time I want to....but without having to stand in long lines and only once a year
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game is challenging and fun with enough of a spooky back story that you want to find the answer to the mystery in addition to finding all the hidden objects. I reccomend this game for both the story and the challenging aspect of finding the objects and solving the mystery.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I've been interested in the SKX007 model for years, and finally made the decision to acquire one. I realize there are both K and J versions, but won't get into that here. This review is for the K model.<br /><br />Watch appearance is largely subjective so I'll try to comment on more objective characteristics. As a watch enthusiast, I am impressed by the build quality of this watch. The case is polished (machine polished, not bright shiny like a chrome plating). The caseback has the famous Seiko tsunami emblem. The rubber strap is the classic Seiko diver version; my wrist is 7 3/4 inches and the strap sizing is fine. The rubber strap is on the stiff side; some may find the stiffness less than ideal but it has not bothered me enough to replace it. The bezel clicks precisely; some have reported misaligned bezels, but mine is spot-on (bezels can also be adjusted if a slight misalignment is too much for your preference). The watch has a smooth second hand sweep, incredible super luminous hands and markers (the lume even glows in daylight sometimes), and a rock-solid screw down crown. In nearly 3 months of wear the automatic movement has kept accurate time. Additionally, I should note my SKX007 arrived in the factory Seiko box and included all packaging, tags, and papers.<br /><br />As many already know, the SKX007 has a pedigree. Seiko hit the mark, as this diver line has stood the test of time over many decades. I travel frequently and this watch is always in my &#34;everyday carry&#34; kit.<br /><br />**Update April 2017**<br />I have had this watch for four years and it has become my all-time favorite, go-to watch-- even more so than some watches that cost several multiples more than the SKX007. The Seiko quality and performance for the price is amazing. Incredible accuracy. The case, bezel, strap, and crystal still look new, even after these years. Highly recommend the SKX007 or it's closely-related brethren, the SKX173.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|While some details were fictionalized for the sake of dramatic intensity, this film, based on the novel, was well-written, well-directed and brilliantly acted. Anyone interested in international intrigue will be sitting on the edge of their seats for parts of the movie. In hindsight, we all know that the US could have acted more effectively, but at the time,  President Carter did what was morally right. Unfortunately, it was not politically correct, but the Bush alternative affected hundreds of thousands and devastated lives. Great contrast in presidential responses to terrorists.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|As it probably brought most people.  I'm so inspired by this story about success and acknowledgment and the music throughout the documentary was so good I just had to go and buy this album on principle alone to support this artist.  Always support good music and good people.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is a fascinating watch for anyone interested in US history, and especially in the history of the Civil War. The book and the script attempt to portray an extraordinarily complex point in time when a nation divided was eventually united, but not without the loss of a sea of blood. Also riveting was the handling of the political warfare between Republicans and Democrats in a time in our history when their platforms were almost the opposite of what they are today, with Democrats fighting abolition and Republicans fighting for it. Lincoln's external monologues, where he doubts the legality of some of his decisions and ventures into situation ethics, are intriguing, and vividly illustrate how there are no absolutes in the political arena.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! Would recommend it to everyone!!! Amazing free game that's just as good as temple run! A must-have for all kindle owners!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I waste hours on this app. I love my fake horses. I'm awaiting the day when I can finally own a unicorn.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|The only difference between the free Little Piano and the &#34;Pro&#34; is that the &#34;Pro&#34; does not have advertisements. This is a fun one octave key piano...enough to get a melody going to share with others the tune you have in mind. It is chromatic.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This has the best graphics I have ever seen! Willow Woods and The Dark Forest hold many exciting and new obstacles like the hot air balloon ride you can go on or the map transfer portals. This game is probably the best temple run game so far available on Amazon App store. This game's graphics make you deal like you actually are in the movie running from the flying monkeys of the Wicked Witches.
B0083ZBW2Y|2.0|I appreciate the classics. But this book was too heavy and serious . I love animals and don't like the suffering within the book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is full of twists and turns that I completely didn't see coming.  I didn't like how it ended.  Definitely not my favorite book but a good, suspenseful one nonetheless.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie was well done considering that it has to measure up to the Lord of the Rings movies done before that. It's cool how it continues to ties in to the Lord of the Rings movies. Even the part about Frodo going to meet up with Gandalf in the beginning of LOR. Awesome movie!
067003830X|5.0|If you care for anyone who is recovering from a TBI ( Traumatic Brain Injury) or stroke you need to read this book.  You will learn about the various regions of the brain and how they affect the body. You will learn about remarkable cases of recovery and how truly plastic the brain is.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Wonderful movie. Enjoyed it from the start to the finish. Ben Affleck is one of my favorite actors. He was great in this movie. Very natural.
0810995212|5.0|My husband was very glad to receive this lovely book for his birthday.  Great full page illustrations and many details of this gentleman's life story.  A great coffee table addition!
B0013ND30M|5.0|The DVD was in great shape, no scratches.  Would definately use this vendor again.  Wonderful movie for the kids, love it
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Lots of fun. Too short for the money however the graphics are wonderful. I really liked the puzzles. Would love to see more interactive cruise ship seek and finds.
0788859544|1.0|This movie was purchased used so I understand it can't play be perfect.  But the whole movie wouldn't even play.  It got to the end of the movie and started to skip.  There were no visible scratches or smudges on the DVD so I am not sure whats wrong with it.  It is not my DVD player, because all my other movies play fine.  You think the seller would have watched the movie to make sure it would play.  Very dissapointed.  Would not buy from them again
1451695195|5.0|It was a gift, but was well liked.  The price was just right for the amount of money I wanted to spend at this time.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is a great movie for the kids.  Package arrived fast and DVD had no scratches in great shape.  Would use this vendor again
0062238868|4.0|This is my first book about a generation x military hero. The book goes in depth about being an elite special forces of the Navy Seals.  The story shows the dedication that Chris gave our country and other warriors. His story tells the tale of country first. We need men like this to protect our country and our way of life.<br /><br />One aspect of the book that gave true insight, was his wife's view. This really put things into prospective on how difficult family can be when a spouse is at war. Then the strain of having a spouse to 4 tours of combat.<br /><br />This is a good read for anyone interested in snipers, seals, Iraq war, or military. The book gives you a feel of what the situation was like sitting waiting to kill the enemy. As the story goes on, how comfortable Chris became with life or death, day to day operations. It gets to the point where it's almost not believable but Chris even points that out in the book.<br /><br />I liked the book, and I liked the fact that he is a generation x.

1434102750|3.0|The book is okey, nothing more in my opinion. I had just read this book &#34;Hey, Whipple, Squeeze This: The Classic Guide to Creating Great Ads&#34;, so this one was quite a let down compared to that. It´s a quick read though, so it doesn´t hurt to read through it. :-)
B008FPOIT6|5.0|As much as I love books, I love type styles.  They are a form of art that we can hold in our hands everyday.  Add the bonds of rich friendships and you have a classic. This is a classic born at one very specific point in time.
0071373586|4.0|I think this is a good book, and a easy way to learn about positioning different types of products, brand and even yourself.
B004USRKX8|5.0|I used to listen to this (then) relatively obscure album in high school.  In 2010 it was listed second on the top ten pop albums of all time by an Italian newspaper.  Regardless of whether or not one agrees with that ranking there are numerous reasons why this album has 130+ reviews of the highest rating.  The roster of musicians contributing on this record reads like a who's who of legendary musical artists of the 1970's.  David Crosby was surrounded by a constellation of brilliant musicians on this album with him at the epicenter. No doubt, he's an influential and iconic artist. A founding member of bands such as the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, David Crosby has an incredibly unique voice.  He's capable of harmonizing, singing and songwriting like no one else.  The smooth texture and original work on this record are breathtaking and atmospheric.  Saturated with and bathed by ringing 12-string guitars, tracks such as \\"Laughing\\" with Crosby singing stunning harmony alongside Joni Mitchell (an 8-time Grammy and Lifetime Achievement Award winner) and Jerry Garcia's mournful pedal-steel are positively mesmerizing.  It's difficult to argue with Crosby's monumental talent and the company he keeps. After twenty-five years of listening I haven't tired of this record.  If you like folk and pop music of this period buy this CD...it's a masterpiece.  \\"Song With No Words\\", \\"Orleans\\" and \\"I'd Swear There Was Somebody Here\\" are magnificent. What David Crosby and Stephen Barncard did in 15 minutes with an echo chamber recording \\"I'd Swear There Was Somebody Here\\" is nothing short of incredible; stupefying is probably a more appropriate description.  Albeit 42 years old now the musical gems on these recordings are premium stuff.
039472903X|4.0|So my boss recomended me to read this book, and told me everyone that works in the advertising business should know about mr. Ogilvy. And he is right, everybody should know who this man is, and I can see why he was so successful in his time. The core content in this book probably still applies, but this book was written in 1985, and I think we can all agree that the advertising business has evolved rapidly during this period. I would recomend all to read this just to know the history of this intelligent man, and I would recomend everybody to read this book if you are looking for an equally good book, with more updated information: Hey, Whipple, Squeeze This: The Classic Guide to Creating Great Ads.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the best thing for Mp on roadwarrior but I never got my Mp for doing what they told me.I can play it all day.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Justin Timberlake has done it again. If you love Justified and Future Sex /Love Sounds, you will go crazy for this album. All the tracks and beats are insane, Love it
B005LAIIKI|3.0|What's up?, most likely Tarantino will re-release this again with 2 hours of special features...I should wait on this one. The three stars is for the presentation with NOT many special features.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|It was great, but I wish we could get the DVD of the Portofino performance.  I hope it will be available soon.
0553801503|5.0|I only started reading this series after the TV series came out.  I was warned by many that I would hate Book 4 and should only skim it so that I got the story line and could move on to Book 5.  Instead, I found myself thoroughly enjoying it.  Book 4 may be different than the previous 3, but it is tremendously interesting, particularly in its depiction of what the Middle Ages must have been like in England.  I also enjoyed the expansion of the various characters as they grow in time and experience.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Realmente nos gusto mucho la pelicula, ademas es mejor verla si has visto las demas!!! Recomendada!!! We love it!!! We enjoy it with the family!!!
B008220C56|5.0|I was surprised by how much I appreciated the style and direction of this film, although I am not surprised that other people were turned off by it.  I suppose that taking an innovative perspective alienates a large portion of your audience, and I do feel like that is what happened here.  Filming the majority of the movie in a theatre was a brave move, and I do think that it would have failed with a less talented cast.  The sets were VERY stylized and interesting, but the quality of the acting brought the film back down to earth and gave it a sense of emotional realism that rounded it out for me.  A sumptuous eyefeast, definately.<br />The theatre setting really appealed to me, personally.  I felt like it made a statement about... privacy maybe? All the world is a stage? Maybe i'm reading too much into it, but i thought it could have served a symbolic purpose.<br />Well.....the setting won't do anything for you if you can't stop asking \\"WHY?\\" long enough to appreciate its merits.<br />Personally, i found this movie pretty fantastic. (oooh! I loved the choreography too!) Most movies this aesthetically appealing do not balance their flash with such a deep undercurrent of .....PASSION!  So my socks were knocked off.<br />(also, there were some pretty great moustaches in this movie)

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|My husband and I started watching The Walking Dead last Sunday and finished Season's 1 and 2 by Thursday, it is very addicting and we love it.  Now AMC on demand only has episodes 9 through 16 so I think we have to wait until the Blu Ray comes out so I kinda want to watch both of the other seasons over again.  I can't get enough of the show, I can't believe I didn't start watching this sooner.  I hate waiting but we don't want to watch it online, we want to watch it on our tv.  We watched the other seasons on Netflix, it was perfect.
