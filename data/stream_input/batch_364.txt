B000002HMH|4.0|Smashed into a pulp by Metallica die-hards when it was released, Load deserved very little of the harsh criticism directed at it. And let's face it, all it was about is that the Metallica fan had to face the fact that his mean thrash metal skull and blood and death band Metallica had a ballad playing on the radio. What a bummer. What a massive hit to the ego. \\"I'm listening to a band that has a ballad about their mama playing on the radio! Metallica, how could you?\\" <br /> <br />Cheap shots aside, Load rocks hard for the most part. No one can question the balls to the wall hard rocking in Ain't My Bitch, 2 X 4, The House Jack Built, King Nothing (pretty much a harder and better Enter Sandman), Cure and Wasting My Hate.  <br /> <br />Less aggressive, more melodic and bluesy songs come in the form of Until It Sleeps, Bleeding Me (one of the best songs Metallica has ever done), Poor Twisted Me and The Outlaw Torn. Then of course there are the two often hated, but fine ballads Hero of the Day and Mama Said.  <br /> <br />Songs that fall flat for me are Thorn Within and Ronnie. Not unlistenable, but just too average to really get into. The Outlaw Torn becomes negligible as well. <br /> <br />Even now, 10 years on, Load remains an excellent rock album. Sure, it's not classic Metallica. It's a hard rock/metal album, not a thrash album, and as far as hard rock/metal albums go, you'll need to look long and hard to find something a hell of a lot better than this.  <br /> <br />Drop your prejudice, forget about what came before, and enjoy Load for the great, diverse album it is. The songwriting is solid, the guitar solos frequent, soaring and powerful and it's not just the same thing over and over again like on so many early Metallica albums. You get a unique blend of metal, hard rock, bluesy rock and ballads all on one album.  <br /> <br />The follow-up, Reload, is just a monotonous blend of over-familiar tunes and recycled riffs that smells of a band trying to dowse the flames that sprang up from their fan base after Load's release. Load remains a bold change of direction, one of the most original Metallica albums, and probably one of the most ridiculously underrated and unjustifiably slammed rock albums ever.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Definitely a release that you feel in the gut! Cornell is the quintessential voice of rock. Who else can hold the notes and deliver the same punch? That's right, you have to dig deep to come up with anyone. The band seems prepared to deliver the goods, but they come up short on diversity and complexity. Background rythyms drone at times. The true instrument on this CD is Cornell.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I would argue that HANNIBAL is the best of the Lecter movies. While &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon/Manhunter&quot; tried to bridge a naturalistic crime procedural with the boogeyman-like Lecter parts with its always spooked FBI agents, Ridley Scott made it all one big, operatic fantasy. As a result, it is by far the most unpredictable, stylish, and least pretentious of the trilogy. In this film, Hannibal is more like Highsmith's Tom Ripley, an extension of our own hidden desire to take on all that stands in our way or in the way of all that's dear to us.
B00005JMFR|3.0|The incredible phenomenon of \\"The Matrix\\" that hit theaters in 1999 was a landmark film that defined and redefined what we know about science-fiction/action movies and the special effects that can be employed.  The minds behind the madness, the Wachowski brothers, decided to capitalize on the first film's enormous popularity by creating two sequels (\\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" and this one, \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\") to complete a spectacular trilogy.  To avoid the pitfalls of making fans waits ridiculous amounts of time between each sequel (like the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels), the Wachowskis decided to film \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" at the same time with the intention of releasing them about a half a year apart (\\"Lord of the Rings\\" director, Peter Jackson, employed this same strategy).  Unfortunately, due to onset tragedies and unforeseen delays, the sequels didn't appear until four years after the original, at least a year and a half later than was intended.  Still, the first sequel, \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\", did a credible job of continuing and expanding the story begun in the original.  The meta-philosophical gobble-de-gook didn't bog down that film due to its awe-inspiring and relevant action sequences.  With a bit of a cliffhanger, the table was set for the final part of the trilogy, \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\" to end this saga with a spectacular flourish.  Alas, \\"Revolutions\\" turns out to be a mixed bag.  It still provides some awe-inspiring battles, but the discussions get more arcane than in the previous film, and there are some plot developments late in the film that seem to go against everything that has led to this point and create a decidedly unsatisfying and incomplete conclusion.  <BR><BR>\\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" ended with Neo (Keanu Reaves) trapped somewhere in between the Matrix and human world as the result of using some newfound human powers.  While Neo tries to find his way back to the real world, the humans must still contend with the deadly armada of sentinels still drilling towards Zion in an attempt to exterminate the humans.  After some garbled philosophical discussions, including wasted appearances by Merovingian and Persephone, Neo returns to the real world and a decision is made on what must be done.  After much discussion and arguing, Neo and his lover, Trinity, take one of the human ships to go towards the machines' main city and try and defeat them there, while the remaining humans (such of Morpheus, et al) take the remaining ship and rush back to Zion in an attempt to provide some help during the inevitable battle with the sentinels.  The stage has been set for some truly dramatic developments and, indeed, much of what happens over the next hour is quite compelling and dramatic.  Neo and Trinity's approach to the machine city is a technological marvel.  Much is revealed about the structure and extent of the surface of Earth.  Many miles below the surface the tension of waiting for the sentinel armada is palpable.  Once the battle starts, it becomes a mind-bending sensory assault of images that at once seem to clutter the screen, but never become so indistinct that you cannot tell what is happening.  In terms of technical achievement, the Battle for Zion may be second only to the freeway battle in \\"Reloaded\\".  <BR><BR>Unfortunately, there is more to the movie than this, and the last 30-45 minutes is both ponderous and frustrating.  It is very tempting to reveal the final plot twists so that you can understand the confounding left-turn this film takes, but in the interests of not playing spoiler, I won't.  I will put forth that this does create a decidedly unsatisfying ending, though.  This is truly disappointing, because the \\"Matrix\\" trilogy had the potential to completely redefine the definitions of existence and, perhaps, even spawn a new school of philosophical thought.  It just seems as though the Wachowskis got too clever for their own good and the trilogy ends up being less than the some of its parts.\\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\" is not a bad movie.  Its actions sequences are enough to grant it three stars.  However, it is my belief that, in time, the original \\"Matrix\\" will be viewed on its own as a truly great film, with two sequels being thought of as frustrating and necessary additions.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Strongest, most powerful voice I have ever heard. I first heard him on a morning show when this album was first released and with his unique voice giving me chills, I immediately had to purchase his albums.<br />His beautiful voice shines on every track and he really makes you feel when listening to the songs. I really prefer the English songs, not sure why the Italian? songs are mixed in. I do like the Italian songs, but I feel more emotion with the English songs when I know what he is singing about.<br />More people need to discover this singer, his voice is one in a billion!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Over the years from Christina Aguilera's debut album was released, we can see such dramatic maturity from Stripped.  This by far, is one of my favorite albums that I own.  Before I begin, I would like to say to music audiences that the audience should always have an open mind to music and not to judge without listening to the product itself.  That is most important for Stripped because many have jumped to conclusion that Christina Aguilera's Stripped is no different from her debut album or that this whole album is just \\"Dirrty\\". <br />Stripped has shown such intellectual maturity of Christina Aguilera over the years.  Some songs deals with the past events that have made an impact on her, her sexuality, and more importantly a reflection of who she really is.  <br />1.Stripped pt. 1: This is basically a prelude to the entire CD.  It is a montage of news events daeling with Fred Durst, Britney Spears, etc.  Then it goes of with a message sung by Aguilera about her new empowered self, \\"Sorry I don't fake it, Sorry I come to real...\\" <BR>5/5<br />2.Can't Hold Us Down: This song backbone is driven by an R&B beat featuring Lil Kim.  This song is Christina's 4th released single and the message is about the double standards between a male and a female \\"a guy can get all the glory the more he can score, when a girl does the same, you call her a whore...\\"<BR>4/5<br />3.Walk Away: This song is very dramatic lyrically and through the expressive vocals within this piece.  Sure, it won't catch your attention at first, give it a couple tries and I'm sure you'll be singing it, \\"I learned how to bleed, I was prey in your bed...\\"<BR>5/5<br />4.Fighter: The \\"rock\\" side of Christina is revealed through this song. It is great with Aguilera's vocal capabilities as it is very expressive.  A song about being empowered from past pains \\"you think I hold resentment for you,  but oh no, your wrong\\"  The third released single.<BR>5/5<br />5.Infatuation Interlude: just an interlude to the next track of Aguilera speaking in Spanish and revealing her heritage, talking about her first love.<BR>4/5<br />6.Infatuation: A Spanish driven song about Christina and her past love who is Spanish decent.  \\"He brings life to my fantasy, sparks some passion inside to me\\"<BR>3.5/5<br />7.Loving Me for Me Interlude: it basically sets the tone for the next track.  Very soothing.<BR>3.5/5<br />8.Loving Me for Me: will take a while before you would like but after a while, it will become one of your favorites.  This song talks about being loved for who she is \\"I've been kissed by destiny, oh, heaven came and saved me\\"<BR>4/5<br />9.Impossible: a track that could sound like one of Alicia Keys (because it was written, back up vocals, and piano supported by her).  This song is really great and shows the strength of Christina Aguilera's vocals without overdoing it.  <BR> \\"It's impossible for me to give you what you need\\"<BR>5/5<br />10.Underappreciated: This song is supported with a Choir Chorus.  This is one of my least favorite tracks within this CD.  \\"I feel underappreciated\\" <BR>1/5<br />11.Beautiful: Great empowering song with a great catchy chorus.  Very dramatic climax to the song with such a powerful voice.  It is the second released single. \\"Cuz we are beautiful, no matter what they say\\" <BR>5/5<br />12.Make Over: Another least favorite track of Stripped.  Not my cup of coffee. <BR>2/5<br />13.Cruz: A great song talking about leaving an old life and looking forward to a new life. \\"My hand surfs through the wind, cool, calm, collective, is the child that lies within\\"<BR>5/5<br />14.Soar: a very great inspiring song supported by chorus singers.<BR>\\"Just spread your wings and soar\\"<br />15.Get Mine Get Yours: 1/2 sexually provocative tracks within Stripped.  Has a great beat and everything.  Talks about causal sex \\"It aint about the kissing and hugging, this is about the physical loving\\"<BR>5/5<br />16.Dirrty: one of my first favorite songs of Stripped and her first releasedsingle.  Great beat, and shows a side everyone tries to fake and hide.<BR> \\"Oh I'm overdue, give me some room...\\"<BR>5/5<br />17.Stripped pt.2: another small segment of Christina giving a message away about not being an image that people want her to and giving away some info to oppose such claims.<BR>\\"Sorry I ain't a diva\\"<BR>4/5<br />18.Voice Within: the fifth single with empowering lyrics.  Great for such a strong voice.  Talks about trusting that inner voice \\"Just trust the voice within\\"<BR>5/5<br />19.I'm OK: it is a very emotional track.  It is very haunting and shows a much more intimate side of Aguilera. \\"my father's fist would put my mother in her place\\"<BR>4/5<br />20.Singing My song: it's very much empowering song. <BR>\\"I'm keep singing my song\\"<BR>3/5<br />This CD truly shows Christina's maturity over the years.  She has written almost all songs for this CD and had control over the production of this CD.  Christina's vocals show once again why she is a true artist.  In a competition amongst many artists out there, not much can really compare to Christina Aguilera.  She has a good sense of herself and does not care what the media thinks of her and does whatever is right for her.  This CD is a product of a 5 Grammy nominations and has already won other awards.  Purchase this CD is a must. It has five released successful singles that have made top 200 released singles, MTV TRL, BET, and more.  Look forward to her Stripped DVD released in January. Thank you Christina.
0446530891|3.0|Good thing the beginning and the first 3/4 of the book were good, or I never would have finished the book.  The ending was too unrealistic and by that point there were so many characters introduced that it was hard to remain interested.
6302794331|5.0|Every Christmas Eve for the last 8-10 years we watch this movie. Christmas is not complete until we do. We are buying our 22 year old son his own, as he will not be with us this year. (Refers to VHS version.Bummer about the DVD. I won't get it now that I know the song has been cut.)
B000002UAX|5.0|Prepare to be transported.  This is the real deal - the one that set the Beatles apart from everyone else.  Here they rewrote the rulebook for EVERYTHING that followed. Still the greatest album ever - nothing touches it.<br />PS - I totally agree with the music fan from Kennewick, WA - absolutely spot-on mate.
B00005B4GU|5.0|this was the first radiohead album i listened to start to finish, and it is simply amazing. it is in the vein of Kid A, but the songs are more separate entities-it doesn't have the same flow as Kid A.  this doesn't mean it isn't a great(!!!) album, it just a wee bit different.  interesting social commentary, beautiful texturing, odd rhythms and general brilliance.  buy this album!!!
185984054X|5.0|Mother Teresa has become a cliche -- in and outside India. A figure known so well for charity and generosity that even the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi -- who was incidentally also called a Mother by millions of Indians -- couldn't resist her (media) charm. Indira Gandhi sterilization for the masses as a govt. policy, while the subject of her affection was openly against birth control and undid what is right for the country.<br />Such is the charm of Mother Teresa that the government of India is planning on instituting an award on her name. While, in fact, Mother Teresa has tarnished the image of India. In a way, probably, Mother Teresa symbolizes all that is wrong with India -- and the world, and much more.<br />Mr.Hitchens provides a compelling picture of Mother Teresa; her cunning and clever manipulation; her innate instinct for dramatization and image building. It is a story of how the old religion meets the glitter of the new mass media.<br />Mr.Hitchens insinuates and is 'ad hominem' at times. Which clearly could have been avoided; he would rather let the 'evidence' do the talking -- which he provides enough of.<br />Although the investigation on Mother Teresa is not exhaustive, whatever Mr.Hitchens presented was worth looking at. All that the media presents as digestible is sometimes not; Mr.Hitchens' book proves that. Saints have no souls and evil is peddled with dogma.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I just rented this movie after my incredibly disappointing theatrical viewing in hopes that diminished expectations would improve me view of the film. It did, but not by much. Knowing where the film was going, the second time through wasn't quite as mind-numbingly tedious as the first. The dialogue was far less excruciatingly awful, revealing itself to meerly be as pretentious and ridiculous as your average made-for-television sci-fi fiasco. Neo still looks like he's having sex with a clone of himself. Morpheus still sounds like he was the one possessed by Agent Smith, and the backward arm crossing went from cool to irritating. The villains remain as uninteresting as everT he wire-fu battles were forced eye candy, and made little sense in the context of the series. My appreciate of hoary sci-fi concepts being explained sensibly to mass audiences in the first film was replaced by the tedium of Psychology 101 spoon fed to people who've seen plenty of mind-screw movies already. Keanu Reeves lacked presence, while the mythology surrounding his character become all to familiar. The cross-pollination between the video game and animated special watered down an already derivative formula to the point of tastelessness. It took George Lucas six years to begin the decline of the Star Wars franchise with \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" meaning the Wachowski brothers easily outstripped his ability to pollute an inspired creation with dreck. The second installment of their trilogy played like that of a certain Episode One, retroactively tainted the original work with it's utter and overheated lameness. As an added bonus, the shingle used to serve this excrement is skimpy on special features, sticking mostly to tiresome special effects documentaries and lengthy advertisements for the ancillary products. Then again, considering the shallow mess I loosely call a story contained within this film, I guess the producers wisely decided to focus on what they knew best.
B000089RVR|4.0|I remember watching one of those audio-based music stations on TV a few months ago, and at one point \\"White Flag\\", the new single from Dido, came on. And I said, \\"It's about TIME!\\" I had been waiting for Dido to bring some new stuff to the table, and she did just that with Life For Rent.<br />As usual, the lyrics are handled by Dido and her brother, with select producers grabbing the pen here and there. And good tracks come out of all this, like \\"Do You Have A Little Time\\" and \\"Sand In My Shoes\\". The hidden bonus track also shows outstanding results.<br />Dido's soft voice is still here, and it's good for painting pictures like \\"See You When You're 40\\", and the interesting story \\"Mary's In India\\". But the subjects don't always stay positive, as proven by the feel-sorry-for-yourself title track. And \\"See the Sun\\" is soul-satisfying, and it may be even heart-wrenching if you or someone you know is going through a tragedy and needs to hear some words of encouragement.<br />There are only two songs on here I could do without. \\"Don't Leave Home\\" gets the message across, but those lyrics aren't the best, and I just couldn't get into \\"Stoned\\". But this is still a great sophomore effort from Dido. Pick it up.<br />Anthony Rupert
0440234743|5.0|The Testament, one of John Grisham's newest novels, is different than most of his previous works.  Most of Grisham's previous novels were set in courtrooms and dealt primarily with the law.  Grisham shied away from his usual legal thriller writing style with The Testament.  This novel does involve several primary characters who are lawyers and the setting is often in the courtroom, however this book also deals with other issues such<BR>as morality, sacrifice, and family issues.  This is something that I enjoyed about this book. Another aspect of this book that I enjoyed was the fine job the author did of describing the characters in a way that made them seem like real people. Grisham did a very good job describing the greed of Troy Phelan's relatives who were all trying to get his money. <BR>One of the most exciting moments happens in the first few chapters of the book as Troy Phelan describes his dramatic suicide.  \\"No one has seen me walk in a year.  I grab the handle and open the door...I step barefoot on to the narrow terrace which borders my top floor.  Without looking, I lunge over the railing.\\" (pg. 20) The theme of this book is that no one ever knows exactly how something is going to end until it happens. I agree with this theme because it relates in at least one way<BR>to my life.  When I first moved to Virginia during my freshman year, I did not think I would like it all.  Now, my attitude has completely changed and I like it a lot here. In The Testament, one of the primary characters, Nate, is introduced as a recovering alcoholic who has deserted his family.  By the end of the book, he has fallen in love with a missionary in Brazil and he decides to stay there with her.  This shows the theme very<BR>well.  I would recommend this book to others because it has many enjoyable aspects.  The characters are complex yet at the same time seem like they are real people,the storyline is exciting, and there is a great twist at the end.  The story also grabs readersright from the beginning with some very exciting moments.
0385504209|5.0|A friend refered this book to me and I'm so glad that I decided to read it! It's very captivating and will keep you reading for hours at a time. The story has a great plot and a suspense fills these pages from beginning to end. Myself being a history lover, I have no doubt that the abundance of historical references kept me on my toes throughout this book. Even though I'm a Roman Catholic I found this book a very good read despite the fact that a chunck of it went against my religion. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to accept other religious points of view.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Like Cher, Madonna and Kylie Minogue before her, Britney Spears doesn't claim to be the world's greatest talent, simply a top-level purveyor of the kind of pop music that gets in your head and won't let go.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|&quot;Let It Be&quot; was always my least favorite Beatles album, although it was years before I understood that Phil Spector had gone all &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; on the tracks after the Beatles and producer George Martin washed their hands of the entire thing and left it with engineer Glyn Johns.  For most of that period my opinion was based on comparing &quot;Let It Be&quot; with &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; in which case there was no question as to which album was better.  Beyond that I never really liked &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; or &quot;Let It Be,&quot; dismissing them as Paul McCartney's attempt to write another &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; and only moderately liking &quot;I Me Mine&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; which I was moderately horrified to discover were two of the tracks Spector worked over, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; being the third.<br />Of course, now we know as much about the history of this album as anything in the Beatles catalogue, which means even with &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; available knowledgeable Beatles fans can complain that this is not the &quot;Get Back&quot; album that Johns originally pieced together before Spectator came in and overdubbed three tracks.  Gone from the old version are &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae,&quot; with &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; added.  Then the order gets reshuffled, so that &quot;Get Back&quot; starts the album and &quot;Let It Be&quot; ends it.  In fact, if you have the original track listings memorized numerically the only one with the same number is #2, &quot;Dig a Pony.&quot;  There is also a bonus disc, &quot;Fly on the Wall,&quot; which lets us hear the Beatles at work in rehersal and in the studio during January 1969, which is worth a listen to one or twice.<br />The net result is that &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is better than &quot;Let It Be,&quot; but the result is still not a great Beatles album.  Maybe what they needed to do was more like what happened to &quot;With the Beatles&quot; when it was turned into their first American release, &quot;Meet the Beatles.&quot;  Throw in &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko,&quot; &quot;Old Brown Shoe,&quot; and maybe even &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot; and then we would be getting closer to the next level.  Besides, I miss John Lennon's &quot;hope we passed the audition&quot; at the end of &quot;Get Back.&quot;  There is such a thing as cleaning up an album too much.  All of this just makes it even more impressive that after the &quot;Let It Be&quot; debacle that the Beatles went back in the studio and went out on top with &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;to &quot;With the Beatles&quot; when it was turned into their first American release, &quot;Meet the Beatles.&quot;  Throw in &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko,&quot; &quot;Old Brown Shoe,&quot; and maybe even &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot; and then we would be getting closer to the next level.

B00012FXB8|4.0|The new \\"Assembly Cut\\" shows hints of what could've been before FOX ultimately took the film away from David Fincher and butchered it. I personally would've preferred a hybrid of the two versions, without a CGI alien, which just isn't scary. With the inclusion of the Rottweiler host subplot, which had much more of an emotional impact than that of the infected Oxen. An actual shot of the dead Newt in the EEV (shown only in the theatrical version), and the birth of the Queen at the end (again shown only in the theatrical version). Though the opening sequences on the beaches of the prison planet are astounding. There is also much more (needed) character development here as well throughout the body of the film and a major new subplot regarding the actual capture of the ALIEN. I admit that the original intended ending had a better optical effect. Everything is shown to scale and you actually see Ripley's body entering the molten lead and burning up. The revamped version, done at the last hour for the original theatrical version was more emotionally disturbing as Ripley grabs the Queen and embraces it, but was a bad optical effect because they did it rather quickly only a few weeks before the film was released. For this reason it was also terribly out of scale when it was redone. The film, nonetheless, as stated in Amazon's review above is still a flawed masterpiece.<br />The extras are an obvious compromise to what the producer of this DVD wanted to show the fans. FOX executives cut over 30 minutes out of the interviews because it showed them in a very poor light and aimed responsibility of the film's failure when it was released theatrically toward them. It also detailed their mistreatment of Fincher, by all who witnessed it. The extras promise an in depth look into what went wrong, but then there are many fade outs (no doubt what was cut out). This is sad. No doubt a perfect example of the all-powerful Hollywood Machine that is FOX, and the probable reason Fincher declined to participate in this release.
B00005NB8J|4.0|It is interesting to watch the 1994 &quot;Stargate&quot; film from the perspective of the spin-off television series, &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; which is on its way to becoming the longest running science-fiction series of all-time.  As was the case with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; we have an okay film that becomes a first-rate television series.<br />Once upon a time, 1928 to be exact, archeologists discovered a strange disc buried in the sand of Egypt.  The next thing we know we are in the present, and Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader), is having his colleagues walk out on him as he explains his radical theory about the ancient Egyptians and their language.  But then a mysterious old woman (Viveca Lindfors) gives him an invitation to travel to a secret military base buried beneath the Rocky Mountains to do translations.  Jackson has nothing else to do, so he shows up, immediately corrects all the mistakes and figures out all the mysteries, and the next thing we know he is being shown the Stargate.  He then joins a military group led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), who has been recalled back to active duty to find out where you go to when you step through the Stargate.  The answer is you go to the other side of the known universe where you discover a desert planet where an alien who was known as Ra (Jaye Davidson) by the ancient Egyptians is lording it over the local humanoids.<br />This movie is mostly eye candy.  Being shot on a desert planet means that it has lots of scenes shot in bright sunlight, which really is unusual for a science fiction film, where they tend to be dark and murky.  &quot;Stargate&quot; brings back the same sort of ideological tension between scientists and the military that we enjoyed during the 1950s with films like &quot;The Thing From Another World,&quot; as Jackson is all excited to explore a brave new world and O'Neill is looking for an excuse to blow everything up with the nuke in the big suitcase.<br />Truth about this movie is that it the ideas are a lot better than than the execution.  The idea of the Stargate is a nice way of circumventing the laws of physics that scoff at warp drive and other narrative necessities to a good space yarn.  It is not a far leap of logic to get from this one Stargate to the idea that there are others, and there is also the nice corrollary that this system explains why there are so many humans scattered throughout the galaxy where they all live on oxygen breathing planets.<br />Beyond that the television series picks up on the Jackson-O'Neill dyad, reducing it to the idea that one is an academic and the other is a warrior and never the twain shall meet.  Of course Richard Dean Anderson's O'Neill is even quirkier than Spader's Jackson, while Michael Shanks's Jackson starts off even more humorless than Russell's O'Neill.  But it all works, so why quibble?  The original &quot;Stargate&quot; ends up being more about style than substance, which is why it is so interesting that the television series could find something substantial upon which to build a television series.<br />If you have yet to see &quot;Stargate&quot; in any version, then you are strongly urged to proceed immediately from this 1994 film to the first season of &quot;Stargate SG-1.&quot;  Even if you find this film tedious, just get through it and move on to the good stuff.  You could not pass go and head directly for season one of &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; but you really need to know the players and some of the rules of the game before hand.Truth about this movie is that it the ideas are a lot better than than the execution.  The idea of the Stargate is a nice way of circumventing the laws of physics that scoff at warp drive and other narrative necessities to a good space yarn.  It is not a far leap of logic to get from this one Stargate to the idea that there are others, and there is also the nice corrollary that this system explains why there are so many humans scattered throughout the galaxy where they all live on oxygen breathing planets.  <br />Beyond that the television series picks up on the Jackson-O'Neill dyad, reducing it to the idea that one is an academic and the other is a warrior and never the twain shall meet.  Of course Richard Dean Anderson's O'Neill is even quirkier than Spader's Jackson, while Michael Shanks's Jackson starts off even more humorless than Russell's O'Neill.  But it all works, so why quibble?  The original &quot;Stargate&quot; ends up being more about style than substance, which is why it is so interesting that the television series could find something substantial upon which to build a television series.  <br />If you have yet to see &quot;Stargate&quot; in any version, then you are strongly urged to proceed immediately from this 1994 film to the first season of &quot;Stargate SG-1.&quot;  Even if you find this film tedious, just get through it and move on to the good stuff.

B00005JMFO|5.0|I saw this movie with my mom (opposed to one reviewer's recommendation) and we both loved it.  The \\"porno\\" scenes some reviewers are referring to are rehearsal sessions between two people who chat and make simple conversation to pass the time while rehearsing.  It was a bit strange, but added some comedy to where as some of the other storylines were more dramatic.  You must understand British humor in order to appreciate these scenes.  <br />This movie toggles back and forth between interconnecting storylines reflecting all the angles, languages, shapes, forms and ages that love comes in.  It is heart-warming entertainment at it's best with an irreplaceably talented cast.<br />Go see this with your boyfriend, husband, mother or friends!
B00005JM0B|3.0|Not being a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I hadn't seen the previous Terminator movies.  I have to say that this movie wasn't all that bad.  John Connor, now an adult, is living in fear of the events that took place at a young age.  On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit, the T-X, (Kristanna Loken) arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines.  The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, that is sent back by the human resistance.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|The best part about the movie The Last Samurai are the distinct faces of the samurai and the score by Hans Zimmer. I'm a huge Zimmer fan, though I won't buy just any Zimmer score without hearing it first. Even without knowing that he had scored the movie, I recognized Zimmer's distinct style as soon as the music began playing in the darkened theater. The top soundtrack composers all seem to leave recognizable audio fingerprints.<br />This score combines the grand, pulsing, martial themes of his work for movies like Crimson Tide and Gladiator with a central twisting, meditative melody that reminded me of the pensive themes in his score for Thin Red Line. It's an absorbing mix of the military and the poetic. Infused with a sprinkling of Japanese motifs, it's a score worth listening to again and again.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|Remembering the Whitney of yesteryear, I eagerly anticipated this CD. How shocked I was when I finally heard it. Gone are the soulful vocals...replaced by Whitney's over-singing the well known songs. When singing holiday music you needn't over sing them, which Whitney does. I was so annoyed after the first five songs, I turned it off. Her voice sounds hoarse and rough, and sadly I won't be buying, or listening to any more Whitney CD's.
B000099T2L|3.0|My sister actually bought the CD the other day.  I was going to buy it myself, but I was a little skeptical about it.  I wasn't sure if it was going to be good or not, so I just left it alone.  But when I heard it.  I liked it a lot.  She's got some great songs on there.  I especially love me myself and I.  That song is Hot.  I do recommend this album.  Please spend your money on this and not on Alicia Keys' new album.  I wrote a review on that too.  I would have much rather gotten Beyonce's CD instead.  I like Alicia and all, but that album isn't worth it.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|For fans of metal and prog, this will be a delight. A bit of a departure from the recent DT work (6 degrees, Scenes, Change) it is heavy, instrumental, and brilliant. Excellent value - recommended purchase.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I AM PUTTING THIS IN ALL CAPS, BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T STAND THIS GIRL.  I REALLY HOPE THAT SHE COMES IN HERE TO READ HER REVIEWS, BECAUSE I WANT HER TO KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER.  SHE CAN'T SING, DANCE, ACT, AND JUST HAS NO TALENT WHATSOEVER.  WHY PEOPLE MAKE A BIG DEAL OVER HER IS BEYOND ME.  I WAS IN NYC A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND SHE WAS IN TOWN PROMOTING THIS ALBUM AND I COULD HAVE THREW UP ALL OVER THOSE FANS OUT AT MTV STUDIOS.  AND WHAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF WAS TO SEE BLACK TEENAGE GIRLS OUT THERE SCREAMING FOR BRITTNEY.  THAT WAS HEARTWRENCHING.  ANYWAY, BRITTNEY SUCKS!!
B00005JMFO|5.0|We laughed so hard it hurt! And, the suspense?  It was as delicious as a Ludlum thriller, only much softer and heart-warming.  Perfect Holiday Season warmup. When it was done, the audience all stood and applauded.  Now, when was the last time you saw that?
B00000K3CK|2.0|I hestitate to buy this dvd because I bought the vhs thinking i was getting the original theatrical release. I didn't. I got the version I see on TNT every Thanksgiving. The version that is cut up from years past. People always write that the part they love is when Maureen O'Hara and John Payne find Kris's cane by the fire place in the house for sale. For me the part that makes the movie is always cut. Tommy Mera is just done with his testimony in court and asks Kris on his way out of court for an offical football helmut and Kris says OK. After the happy resolution of the trail Maureen O'Hara ask Kris to dinner party, but Kris says it is Christmas Eve. The next scene should be the Mera house Christmas morning and Tommy getting his football helmut and mom and dad saying I didn't get it while Tommy is wearing this over sized football helmut. Until I see a completely restored version I will not buy the dvd.
B00006IR5S|5.0|In my opinion, this score is better than the previous from the Scorer's Stone.  Mainly because the orchestration is mmore intense and colorful.  After hearing the Chamber, and then go back to The Stone, you'll feel that the first one lacked some developmental elements, and orchestral emptiness.  William Ross has really taken Williams' score to the next level.  I'm interested to see when Ross will have his own score.
B000002UTT|5.0|I got this album for Christmas in 1988 as a casette....and it was so good...I had to replace it on CD around 1990.  I think this is Roxette's best album that they have ever done.  All of the songs are great....especially the ones toward the end like LISTEN TO YOUR HEART, VIEW FROM A HILL, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, and of course DANGEROUS.  Marie and Pierre made such great music together.  They were the forerunners of current Europop...and for that...we are all grateful!  :)  You should go out and get this one....you will find yourself dancing and enjoying it as much as I did...and still do!!!!!!
B00005OWIU|5.0|This score truly captures all the aspects of Harry Potter and his magical world.  The celesta theme at the beginning is so catchy that you'll know from now on if you hear it that it's the theme to Harry Potter.  And that's what film composers do...associate themes to a mood or character, so that you in the audience will inevitably make the connection.  <br />Although you could hear elements of Star Wars, but the thing is this has become Williams' signature sound, which unfortunately has become people's criticism of Williams.  But honestly, Beethoven sounds like Beethoven, Tchaikovsky sounds like Tchaikovsky...so what's wrong with Willliams sounding like Williams?  Well then one could augue that his Star Wars theme came directly from Holst's &quot;The Planets&quot;...but through the years, Williams has taken that and applied it to film music, and made it his own.  No doubt about it...he's a film music master.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album came out while I was in the middle of my teenage years, and I remember how everyone liked to compare Pearl Jam and Nirvana's music.  How can you?  They are two totally seperate and completely different bands.  Personally, I tended to like Pearl Jam a bit better in those days, and I still do now.  Eddie Vedder has a great voice (very dark at times!!....but that is what makes him so great!)....the lyrics are wonderfully written...and the sound of the album is just...good.  I have most of PJ's albums (except the multitudes of live cds), and this one is still the standout for me.  EVEN FLOW....ALIVE....JEREMY...are instant classics...and will still be standing out 20 years from now.  If you are just discovering grunge/alternative music for yourself, you must have this one in your collection.  Other good selections would be CORE by Stone Temple Pilots, and of course NEVERMIND by Nirvana.  All of these albums have their merits, and all marked the progression of alternative rock.  Get yours today!
B00006JKON|5.0|This is a great CD!! So what if it isnt as coherant as the albums before it? Every single song is great! It did signal the end of the Tull 1 40 minute song record format, but these shorter tunes are still catchey, clever, and very enjoyable. There is no reason not to buy this!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain's Chicago DVD is a must-have for every Shania fan.  Great music, fantastic performance and non-stop fun is what this DVD is all about.  Anyone who considers themselves to be a Shania fan must add this to their collection.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|The movie &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The music is one of the things that made it so great. Bjork's voice is one of the most unique and beautiful in music today. She isn't the typical person you'd imagine doing a musical, though. This soundtrack includes most of the songs from the film, including the amazing sound collage &quot;Cvalda&quot; and &quot;I've Seen It All&quot;, a beautiful and amazing duet with Thom Yorke of Radiohead (this version of the song is far superior to the one in the film. I listened to the soundtrack version long before I saw the movie, and I was dissapointed by the film version. Thom should have played Jeff in the movie). While every song on this soundtrack is just amazing, it's what's not on there that spoils this disc a bit. <BR>    First off, the closing number (we'll call it &quot;The Next To Last Song&quot;) is nowhere to be seen on this disk. I know that it would be a little bit tough putting the song on the soundtrack without revealing plot points, but the lyrics are heart wrenching and amazing. On the subject of plot points, the song &quot;Scatterheart&quot; has had its lyrics seriously reworked. All the other actors' voices have been removed alltogether and some of their parts sung by Bjork. the line &quot;you just did what you had to do&quot; is replaced with &quot;you'll just have to find out for yourself&quot;. This doesnt really make much sense. Also, the version of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; that Selma sings while she is in a very dire situation (I wont say what) could have been pumped up with instruments and given a good treatment. If the songs in the movie were all included in their film version, this CD would have scored a 6, but because of these omissions, I can only give it a 4
0793518326|5.0|I bought this a while back and have yet to find a single mistake in it. Within hours, I had solved some serious puzzles that have plagued my guitar playing for years. The chords I have been using for years were ALMOST right but never sounded correct. Now I have it all. The tablature guitar parts are perfect. I am not a pianist so I can't comment on the piano parts but the guitar parts sound perfect to me. After buying several versions of Beatles music for years and never having good transcriptions, I finally have what I want. Don't listen to the reviewers who nitpick. These are very accurate.
B00005JM02|3.0|My 2.5 year old daughter asked me throughout the movie what had happened to the mama fish (she was eaten by a shark).  When mama fish didn't miraculously come back from the dead or wake up from a coma at the end of the movie, I had to tell my daughter that she had been eaten.  Since then, it's \\"no like Nemo.\\"  Single moms might think twice before letting their very young kids see this.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Upon buying and listening to Afterglow as soon as it was released I had a similar reaction to the majority of reviewers on this page: disappointment.  It didn't catch me immediately and there didn't seem to be a stand-out track like Possession, Full of Grace or The Path of Thorns.  It also seemed like a lot of the same after such a long hiatus during which Sarah lost her mother and gained a husband and child.  Now that it's a good long while since I bought the album I couldn't have a more different reaction to it.  I find myself playing it at least once a day and loving every single song.<br />The single Fallen is outstanding, bringing the themes of sin shown in Surfacing's Witness to a more individual perspective.  The beauty of Sarah McLachlan is that she speaks of the most depressing, sad and worrying aspects of the world in such a subdued way that make her stand out from much of the female singer/songwriter dross that followed in her wake (notable exceptions being Leona Naess, Nerina Pallot and, surprisingly, Natalie Imbruglia's second album, all of which are brilliant).  Whilst Sarah never was one to write songs that grabbed you directly, she has written a set of songs that gently wash over you until you become aware of the intimacy of every lyric and they won't leave your head for days.  Saying that, Stupid is her most immediately catchy song to date and might remind some listeners of Sweet Surrender in this respect.  This seems to see a return of the angry Sarah evoked so perfectly on her cover of XTC's Dear God.  Train Wreck is another favourite and an obvious choice, alongside Stupid, for next single.  The seemingly simple lyrics - 'I'm a train wreck waiting to happen, waiting for someone to come lift me off the tracks' - is so true to life of any kind of relationship that you realise is going to end in a painful mess somewhere down the line but can't seem to lift yourself out of it.  My biggest problem with the album on initially listening to it was that Time, Push and Answer seemed to blend into each other too much and that perhaps Sarah had taken her efforts to produce a quiet nightime album a bit too far.  However, just like her other albums, after a few listenings you can discern the differences and can't imagine why you thought they were alike in the first place.  The lyrics are, characteristically, beautiful.  A big complant from most people seems to be that Sarah is 'too happy', something which holds a little weight on a song such as Surfacing's I Love You (although this is immediately undercut by some of her most impressive vocals ever recorded) but doesn't really seem to apply much here.  Sarah McLachlan's always been about pain and if you listen to World On Fire, Dirty Little Secret or Fallen you can't come away with any idea of happiness.  Vocally Sarah is still on top, particularly on Perfect Girl, and can evince heartache without ever raising her voice.<br />Afterglow was an apparent return to the sound of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and it's true that it comes across as kind of a crossbreed between that and Surfacing.  Whilst it's not as good as the former, Sarah's masterpiece alongside Solace, it's probably better than Surfacing (though there's no one song that's quite as good as Full of Grace on here) and complements it perfectly.  For all those who derrided Afterglow immediately, proclaiming they couldn't even listen to it all the way through, give it a chance.  This is better than nearly everything else this year.
B00005Y7PS|1.0|Look guys, I appreciate the real Sabbath fans trying to be objective about this but you are praising one big pile of ish! This album, for all intents and purposes, is horrible. Tony Iommi is the man but he isn't the man on this. There is nothing remotely cool about this album. Generic production, generic singer (Tony Martin, cmon, the guy drives a cab) and the song structure is nothing even close to vintage Sabbath. If you own all their other albums, you're gonna wind up buying this anyway but to the new kid looking to get into Sabbath, don't trust anything after 1975. After that, buyer beware. Tyr stinks, bottom line.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|With Creed MIA Nickelback has risen to the occasion to keep hard rock on the charts. If you are familiar with the band you know they are Canadian and play a post grunge style of Hard Rock. Their 3rd album Silverside Up went multiplatinium and they could have gone the route of Staind and weakened their sound to stay on the charts. Insead on this album Long Road they toughen their sound while still maintaining clean vocals, melody, &amp; strong musicianship. This is a very impressive album and if you like their earlier work then you should like this one too. Nickelback are growing as a band and they are only now just hitting their stride. I expect more brillant work from them in the future. Until then enjoy this great album, you won't be disappointed. If you like Creed, Nirvana, or Pearl Jam then this album is perfect for you.
B00006RINF|4.0|Actually, I'm giving this album 3 1/2 stars.  In the rise of the pop-\\"goth\\" band Evanescence, I've realized that there are so many other bands that are more or less metal but with a female singer (as opposed to any other kind of female vocalist, i.e. Angela Gossow of Arch Enemy).  And not just others, but ones that have been around longer, and perform far better.  In this time, I've heard about this Lacuna Coil band, and decided to check them out, especially after rave reviews of their latest album, COMALIES.  Well, they have been around longer than Evanescence, and they're better, but...not really THAT much better.<br />I'll give the band their dues right now: Christina Scabbia is a very talented singer.  She's got a good range, and her voice is very ethereal - she is excellent as a goth metal singer.  Plus, on the title track, she even sings in Italian.  Also, the overall mood and feel of the songs is nice.  Melodic, gloomy, and altogether beautiful.  <br />So what's wrong with them?  The musicianship.  There are two guitarists in the band, but for the most part, it sounds like they only need one - it's basically all riffing, with scattered notes and leads.  The bassist does not stand out in the least; he merely plays with the rhythmic guitars.  The drummer is okay, but again, not very complex or intriguing.  I'd say that perhaps the band is better at playing their instruments than the band of Evanescence (who are all no better than most numetal bands), but they really need to kick up their abilities in order to be really special.  They keyboards are pretty nice, though.  Finally, Andrea Ferro, the male singer, is rather annoying, with his croaking, raspy voice as he often duets with Christina.  If he would just shut up and keep playing the keyboards, Christina's voice alone would have been at its best.<br />Lacuna Coil is something of a disappointment for me, or at least on this, my first, album from them.  However, I'm willing to give them more of a chance.  They don't COMPLETELY suck...they just need better music to further compliment the undeniable talent of Christina Scabbia's voice.  For a band that *FAR* surpasses Evanescence,  check out The Gathering.  The band is very talented musically, and their singer, Anneke Van Giersbergen, is simply unrivaled and fairly underrated - she's my current favorite female singer.  For another band that goes for a similar duet style like Lacuna Coil, check out Theatre of Tragedy.  Now THEY can do it right.  Alas, there are better bands than Evanescence out there, but Lacuna Coil shouldn't be the first that one should explore.
B000066NW0|1.0|This crappy music is perfect for teenage girls. Avril is a fake bad girl singing horrible music. Yet it lets the listener think they are hearing a rebel in action when they are really hearing safe, boring, pop. Get this for your daughter if you want her to feel like a rebel without really rebelling. Even Britney is more true to herself then this junk. If you want to hear a real woman sing get something by Alanis Morrisette. She knows how to play pop with an edge.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Peter Gabriel is one of my all-time favorite artists and it's usually his slower songs such as &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Red Rain&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot; which I listen most often to.  I think some of Peter's slower material are arguably the most powerful &quot;ballads&quot; ever written.  While I very much agree with most of the songs included in the 2-disc set, it's disappointing that two of my favorites aren't, namely &quot;Washing of the Water&quot; (from &quot;Us&quot;) and the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Mercy Street&quot; (from &quot;So&quot;).  &quot;Mercy Street&quot; does appear in &quot;Sixteen Golden Greats&quot; and the &quot;Growing Up Tour&quot; DVD, but I think for the person listening to Peter Gabriel for the first time, &quot;Mercy Street&quot; at least, is a must-have.  Don't get me wrong, though, this is an excellent introduction to Peter Gabriel and for the price, you can't go wrong.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney Spears is a beautiful woman no doubt about that. She can dance better than most pop stars for sure. She is also very charismatic but there is one major problem for this gorgeous hit making machine, she can't sing. You are better off buying a poster and admiring her looks, instead of listening to this poor musical effort. At least she is starting to write more of her songs proving she isn't purely just a corporate barbie designed to sell more soda to the masses. Of course the song she writes aren't any good but that's besides the point if you're watching her plastic T!ts jiggle in a video. The only decent song on here is I got That Boom Boom. The rest of the songs are been there done that dance/pop tunes. Although these songs do provide a glimpse into her fast paced world of snorting coke &amp; doing a bunch of guys lifestyle. The best way to experience Britney is watch her with mute on. She is just a glorified dancer. If you want some real music check out Slayer's Reign in Blood or Slipknot's Iowa. If you want a beautiful woman writhing in heat wishing she could sing this is perfect for ya.
B000056HRZ|5.0|My heart thrills as I watch this movie.  This for me is the romantic movie par excellant.  The hope for love, the dashed desires, the renewal of possibility...and the ending, the amazing ending, unexpected by even the actors, is true romance- not in just the idea of love between a man and a woman, but romance in a literary Woodsworthian way.  Ideals, and desires, and love are all one, in the decisions we must finally make in life.<br /><br />The sighs of delight in how events develop can not detract from it's stars, but there are negatives to the movie.  Primarily it's setting.  As a resident of Casablanca, I have to say it has nothing to do with Casablanca or Morocco.  Perhaps it's more appropriate to say it has everything to do with Casablanca- the Western name for the city, and nothing to do with Dar Baida- the native name of the city.  The movie's not even filmed here, but rather in Hollywood.  So you have a triparty attempt to control by the French Resistance, the Vichy government and the Nazis, and Rick, the American.  Occasionally some Moroccans are trotted out to remind us that this takes place in Morocco, but they are stereotypical caricatures.  The most telling scene in this respect is when the Nazi anthem is drowned out by the French anthem, and everyone feels there was a bit of justice done this night- all of the movie protagonists, and all the viewers.  But what is missing is a bit of the history of this time- how the French colonized Morocco, wrested control of the country from it's inhabitants, imposed their values and culture and stripped away the freedom from the Moroccans.  And how the Moroccans had to fight a bloody war of resistance to the French occupation after WWII to win their freedom.<br /><br />So we bear this in mind as we watch.  But then, accepting the lack of reality, it is a wonderful movie of romance, and I will happily dispense with reality for a brief bit of idealism any day.
B00005JKC3|1.0|this is one of THE WORST movies i have ever seen! about fourty minutes of of really bad scientific jargon, and about fourty minutes of horrid looking shrek style action! and the remaining time is a feeble attempt at a romance betweenthe jolly gren giant on steroids and a very roasted Jennifer Connolley, and an attempt to be deep and deal with some disturbing issues about child trauma. I wish i could give it less than one star! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!
B0000DJZA0|3.0|I like Coldplay, I really do.  However, a DVD which showcases them live, in a large venue ruins the experience.  Coldplay is much better in an imtimate setting and watching them play to masses is unsettling .  My biggest problem with the DVD is the choppy editing; the picture can't seem to focus on one moment.  Nine video cameras being used for filming is far too excessive.<br />Another problem is that they are trying to transform their beautiful, simple songs into epics.  Check out the version of &quot;Yellow&quot; in this set and you'll see what I mean.<br />So I guess what I'm trying to convey is to spend your money elsewhere.  If you want to watch Coldplay in person, try to catch them on a club tour(if they still do that).  Their songs just aren't fit for arenas.
B000065V3H|5.0|I first this movie in the theatres when i was child back in the 1980's.  This film is about Ronald Miller, a regular guy from Arizona who mows lawns and goes to High school.  One lawn in particular belongs to Cindy Mancini, the most popular girl in town,who does not even acknowledge Ronald's existence. Well, Cindy goes to a party wearing an expensive outfit that her mother forbade her to wear when she asked her.  One of the jocks gets careless with his red wine and throws it right onto Mancini's outfit.  Now, Cindy is in trouble when she can't get the stains out or a replacement dress.  Then, Ronald offers to pay for the dress if she goes out with him because he is certain that it will instantly make him the most popular guy in school and he is right.  But,when Ronald makes friends with the jocks his somewhat dorky ex-friends resent his ignoring them and Ronald eventually is pressured into throwing crap at his best friend's house on Halloween.  Then the best part of the movie comes, Ronald realizes that they were all friends when they were younger and gives a GREAT speech when one of the jocks get angry that a dork is tutoring one of the hot cheerleader chicks.  The jock says \\"this guy is pulling a Ronald Miller\\" and Ronald smashes a bat and admits that he changed as a person when he became popular.  After that, nobody thinks that Ronald is a Dork for what he did anymore and begin to feel his pain.  He is back to being same old Ronald, who Cindy falls for because she see's him for who he is.<BR>THIS MOVIE IS GREAT.  A TRUE TEEN CHARMER
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I don't get it.  Considering that much of today's music is rubbish, I find it disturbing that &quot;Room On Fire&quot; is getting bashed for sounding too much like &quot;Is This It&quot;.  Should the Strokes be penalized for sticking to a succesful formula?  The Strokes aren't a progressive rock band so cut them some slack.  I think &quot;Room On Fire&quot; is far superior to &quot;Is This It&quot; and proves that the band is here to stay.  Julian and company, keep playing the same stuff and I'll keep buying.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is EXCELLENT in almost every way.  It starts off with a guy on a cell-phone telling somebody on the other line that this truck with Rodgers on the side is coming their way.  Then three or four honda with green lights under the car pull a stunning stagcoach like robbery.  Then, a cut to DODGER stadium and an absolutely gorgeous Green mitsubishi eclipse pulls up with the star Brian O' Conner inside.  He races himself and tops out at about 140 mph.  Brian then goes to a grocery store/restaurant where Dominic(Vin Diesel)works.He fights Dom's best friendVince and gets in hot water.  Brian then goes to race Dom and three other bustas and stupidly enough bets his car and loses it.  But, the cops come out of nowwhere and Brian saves Dom from the police.  They both are then pursued by Johnny Tran, Dom's arch-rival.  Then, Johnny blows up the eclipse and for some reason Dom still think Brian owes him the car.  WHY, itwas your fault he got his car shot up to hell.  Then, Brian earns trust from Dom only to stab him in the heart when he reveals that he is an undercover cop out to crack the case.  This movie is truly MAGICAL.  It might not have the greatest plot, but it blends good actors with beautiful cars well.  Rob Cohen is an awesome director and this movie is much greaterthan ANY OF HIS PREIOUS WORK.  The only bad things about this movie is that Ja-rule has a few lines and there could be more action with cars.  Some of the screenplay is downright dreadful, like the part where Jessie comes to Dom's house at the end and when Vince catches Brian snooping around Hector's garage.  Hector is a hispanic who is a suspect of the truck-hijackings, but is soon ruled out of the picture once Brian learns that Dominic is a troubled man with a past that would mess anybody's head up.  No wonder this movie made so much money!
B00008RH1H|5.0|A great deal has been made of the fact that THRONE OF BLOOD (also known as SPIDER'S WEB CASTLE) is drawn from one of Shakespeare's most celebrated plays.  This is both a blessing and a curse, for while it gives western audiences a point of reference, it also invites all sorts of comparisons that viewers familiar with the Shakespeare play feel honor-bound to make--and that can get in the way of seeing the film as it is rather than what we expect it to be.  And that would be a great pity, because what it is in and of itself is quite fine indeed.<br /><br />The cast is a very strong ensemble, with frequent Kurosawa star Torshiro Mifune leading the film with a remarkably fine performance as the ambitious warrior Taketori Washizu. To my mind, however, the most memorable performance is offered by Isuzu Yamada as Lady Washizu--who plays the role with a demonic stillness that cracks into physical action only when she is completely sure of herself or in utter desperation.  It is one of the most disturbing characterizations I have ever encountered.<br /><br />As usual in any Kurosawa film, the imagery involved is extremely powerful, and the moody tone of the film quickly draws viewers in--and once ensnared there is no escape; the film holds your attention with considerable ease throughout.  Even so, I would not recommend THRONE OF BLOOD to western audiences who have never seen a Kurosawa film, for it is so completely Japanese in aesthetic that some may find it hard to grasp.  It is best seen after you are already familiar with both Kurosawa's work and Japanese cinema in general.<br /><br />The Criterion DVD is quite good, with a nicely restored transfer and bonus features that include the original trailer, a choice of subtitle translations (I prefer the Hoagland translation), and a somewhat awkward but ultimately rewarding commentary track by Michael Jeck.  If you're a Kurosawa fan and you've never seen THRONE OF BLOOD, this is your opportunity; if you're looking to replace an existing video with a DVD, this one is likely as good as it gets.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewern existing video with a DVD, this one is likely as good as it gets.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
0790731002|4.0|THIS TIME, THE CAPED CRUSADER [VAL KILMER] MUST STOP TWO FACE [TOMMY LEE JONES] AND THE RIDDLER [JIM CARREY] FROM DESTROYING GOTHAM WITH A BRAIN DRAINING DEVICE. MEANWHILE, BATMAN STARTS TO FIND A PARTNER IN DICK GRAYSON AKA ROBIN [CHRIS O DONNEL]. THIS WAS THE LAST OF THE GOOD BATMAN MOVIES. VAL KILMER ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT BAD OF A BATMAN AND CHRIS O DONNEL WASN'T THAT BAD OF A ROBIN NEITHER. THE MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING. I'MA SAY THIS RIGHT NOW, THE NEXT BATMAN MOVIE COMPLETELY MURDERED THIS SERIES.
B00009TB5G|5.0|In anticipation for the 3rd and final installment in the trilogy, we purchased The Two Towers to prepare.   We were surprised to find that the extra 45 minutes enriched the plot rather than drew it out.  (We became sleepy in the theatre in the shorter version!)  Although I cannot put my finger on many of the additions, I can say that the movie flowed better and in it's length was more interesting.  A few additions are notable although not glaring.  It's a long movie and understandable why they cut it, it's a shame not to have given it to views in it's entirety as done here.  Also, they have additional included elements in disks 3-4, one of the most interesting was a literary discussion about how Tolkien came to write the story.    We are now prepared for the final adventure!
0790729652|4.0|IN THIS MEGAHIT ADAPTATION OF THE COMIC BOOK SERIES, THE CAPED CRUSADER [MICHAEL KEATON] MUST STOP THE JOKER [JACK NICHOLSON] FROM TAKING OVER GOTHAM CITY. VERY VERY ENTERTAINING. EVEN THOUGH MICHAEL KEATON IS ARGUABLY THE BEST BATMAN TO EVER GRACE THE SCREEN, JACK NICHOLSON STEALS THE SHOW AS THE JOKER. THIS IS THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE OF THEM ALL. A DEFINTE MUST-SEE FOR ALL BATMAN FANS. FOLLOWED BY THREE SEQUELS.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|In my opinion this is definetly a 5 star album. Unlike some other cds I have bought, I actually love listening to almost all the songs on the cd. My favorite tracks has to be &quot;Karma&quot; , &quot;If I Aint Got You&quot; , &quot;Dragon Days&quot; , &quot;If I Was You Woman&quot; and etc... Good lyrics, good beats, well worth the $money$.
0790730960|3.0|THIS TIME, BATMAN [MICHAEL KEATON] RETURNS TO BATTLE THE PENGUIN [DANNY DEVITO] AND THE CATWOMAN [MICHELLE PFEIFER]. NOT AS ENTERTAINING AS THE FIRST, BUT, IT'S STILL A GOOD MOVIE. IT'S A GOOD THING THAT MICHAEL KEATON RETURNED AS BATMAN FOR THIS ONE. CAUSE IF HE DIDN'T, THIS ONE MIGHT NOT HAVE TURNED OUT SO GOOD. IT HAS ENOUGH ACTION AND ENOUGH GOOD SCENES TO MAKE IT WATCHABLE. THIS WAS THE SECOND AND LAST BATMAN MOVIE THAT WOULD EVER FEATURE MICHAEL KEATON AS BATMAN.
089898890X|5.0|I've had this book for about a month now and am reaping increasing benefits from it.  I've been playing jazz for 20+ years, and have studied various books during that period, so I wasn't sure what Mr. Riley's book would bring to the table.  I was not disappointed.<br />The beauty of this book is that there is something here for players of every skill level.  The explanantions are clear and lucid, the play-alongs are superb, and the subtle insights are priceless (great photos and quotes from the masters too).  Well done....and highly recommended.  (I'd also recommend Kim Plainfield's &quot;Advanced Concepts&quot;, to tighten up your funk, fusion, and Latin chops.  If you spend a year seriously studying each of these books your musicianship and chops will thank you.<br />Have fun...and keep swingin' !!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I am not a Johnny Cash fan - but this album is simply astounding by any standard.  There is so much emotion and honesty in the music that you cannot help but glue your ears to it.  The songs touch that part of each us that is dark, afraid, and reflective.  Make a cup of warm tea, grab an old photo album, and play this CD.
B000088E6D|4.0|Wow, amazing stuff, if you like that sorta thing. A true talent indeed. Be sure to pick up his new Christmas album also. You can really tell he's been stuffing his face over the holidays. Three words: Giant Buble Butt!
B00005UW9T|2.0|This movie is not even close to the real story of Anastasia! It is very unlikely that Anastasia would have survived the REAL way she and her family were attacked, but I'm not going to tell you how because it's pretty grosome. I will tell you, however, that Rasputin did not do magic, No one actully stormed the castil, and Anasasia's grandmother was NOT there at the time! Plus, I watched this when I was a little girl, and I got scared to death! I gave this 2 stars because it is a good story(even if it is made up!).
0060926317|2.0|I've enjoyed the mixed reviews on this book at least as much as I enjoyed the book. Most of the reviews are most insightful (into the reviewer if not the book). This book is syrupy sweet new age regurgitation, and it certainly is fiction. If you like that kind of thing (Wayne Dyer approved!), then enjoy. Think of it as 'Spiritualism for Beginners'. Easy to read, easy to put down, easy to dismiss if you don't agree with it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|In the music industry of today, it's always nice to see a good band become a GREAT band. Such is the case with Dream Theater, five veteran musicians whose latest release, Train of Thought, proves that &quot;aging&quot; in the metal industry can still turn out to be a good thing.<br />The 70 minute shredfest combines the DT of yesteryear, as well as more heavy influences, and molds them together to create one of the most powerful song sets of all time. <br />Tracks:<BR>1. As I Am (7:47) A solid opener. Great vocals, heavy riffs, and a mind blowing guitar solo. What else do you need? 9.5/10<BR>                  <BR>2. This Dying Soul (11:27) My personal favorite song on the album. Contains riffs reminiscent of &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; off of the Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence album. Furthermore, Petrucci, Portnoy and Myung show off their precise and accurate sense of timing from start to finish. 10/10<br />3. Endless Sacrifice (11:24) Similiar to Metallica's &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; song, &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; begins with a simplistic guitar rythymn and slowly but surely builds up to a powerhouse of a rock anthem. Excellent work from Jordan Rudess on keyboards/piano. 10/10<br />4. Honor Thy Father (10:14) Another heavy tune. Riffs galore, sound effects, and yes, Labrie's is using vocal enhancements too! WTF? 10/10<br />5. Vacant (2:57) The slow song on the album features Labrie and a piano and a few strings. This songs was probably only put here to give listeners a three minute intermission-type thing to relax their ears. ALBUM FILLER, but nonetheless, a pretty nice one. 7/10<br />6. Stream Of Consciousness (11:16) The instrumental track on the album. Once again, Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung, and Rudess show the world that they indeed are in a class all by themselves. 9/10<br />7. In The Name Of God (14:14) Excellent intro to a powerhouse of an ending (My favorite group of Dream Theater riffs). I don't know what kind of sick places Petrucci and Portnoy's mind visited when writing this album, but they should definitely go back there again! Mind blowing guitar solo by Petrucci. Choir and strings provide an excellent ending to one hell of an album. 10/10<br />In closing, let me reiterate that I've been listening to Dream Theater ever since Images and Words was released, and Train of Thought is by far my favorite DT album. If you are an avid fan of old Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, or any other heavy rock act, I definitely recommend this album be picked up.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|&quot;You speak treason!&quot;<BR>&quot;Fluently.&quot;<BR> - Maid Marion and Robin Hood, respectively<br />Still one of the best lines between love interests in cinema history. I've been watching this movie since I could talk. When the VCR would boot up, I'd put on my blanket/cape, leap on my plastic rocking horse, grab my cardboard sword, and act out the best Robin Hood movie ever made as it played out on the screen.<br />'Course, I don't do that any more (not sober anyway), but when I first saw the DVD edition of the Errol Flynn classic, it truly made me feel like a kid again. And that's something that I can say for a handful of other movies, if that many. Many have tried to recreate the magic of this movie over the past sixty years, but none has been able to come close to being as good.<br />Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood. But this 1938 film told the definitive story of the knight who turned rebel when the evil Prince John and his #1 lackey, Sir Guy of Gisborne (played to perfection by Basil Rathbone) cross the line in villianhood. It's not just Errol Flynn's irrepressable performance as the legendary outlaw that makes the film. Olivia Dehavalen (yes, I KNOW I spelled that wrong) played the slightly unorthadox, for the time, Maid Marion, and the rest of the cast, from Much the Miller to Little John to Friar Tuck were perfectly cast and marvelously performed. It wasn't just the wonderful duels or tense chase scenes, it was the people who populated this world that made you truly BELIEVE, despite the green tights, that this was the true vision of Robin Hood.<br />The DVD was worth the wait. The video looks better than it has. . . well, ever. There have been numerous restorations on this movie (it was made more than 60 years ago), but this is by far the best. The colors leap off of the screen, from the greens of the forest to the pearly white of Flynn's smile. It doesn't look like a contemporary film by any means, but honestly, it doesn't really need to. Like a good wine, this film silmply gets better with age.<br />The audio is equally impressive, from the redone score to the cleaned up audio track. Gone are the muffled and indistinct voices of a dated VHS. Every line comes out crips and clear thanks to the digital sound, and the music makes you want to join in the swashbuckling just for the fun of it.<br />This is a must-have for anyone who enjoys the Robin Hood legend, and especially for anyone who saw Prince of Thieves (ick), just to see what England's greatest archer was really like. They truly just don't make movies like this anymore.
B000003TAR|5.0|What can I say about Nirvana that hasn't already been said?  In my opinion this is their best work.  This is simply a giant middle finger to the world.  Raw and gritty.  Loud and angry.  Sad and weird. Everything that makes a great album.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I STRONGLY recommend sitting down, by yourself, with a copy of Tolkien's novel, and then listening to this soundtrack in full. I had some pretty high hopes for this soundtrack, and this music exceeds them. <br />Some of my favourites include -<br />Track 1 - A Storm is Coming<BR>A surprisingly upbeat and whimsical introduction to the film. Compared to the previous openings (especially the fantastic 'Foundations of Stone' from The Two Towers), it sounds surprisingly subdued. Still, it's an enjoyable listen, and does provide excellent musical accompaniment to seeing Smeagol sans' makeup.<br />Track 10 - Anduril<BR>Finally, after three years of impatiently waiting, we at last see the forging of Anduril - the Sword of the West! And it's about time!!! Howard Shore makes sure that the payoff here is absolutely huge, with a liberal (and beautiful) use of choral arrangements, and the elven themes from both Rivendell and Lothlorien (just to emphasis exactly who is reforging the Sword of the West).<br />Track 11 - Shelob<BR>This track sounds like it belongs more to an Aliens film than an epic fantasy - it is, however, mildly scary (at least to my ears). Howard Shore has often composed music for David Cronenberg (a famous horror film director), so it should be no surprise that he knows how to scare the pants of film audiences. After hearing this music, so goodness only knows what Shelob will actually look like. And I hate spiders!<br />Track 15 - The Black Gate Opens<BR>Despite its bleak title, this is a surprisingly hopeful and optimistic tune. There are a few welcome reprises of tunes from FOTR and TTT, including the Fellowship tune, Hobbiton, and the 'Into the West'.<br />Track 16 - The End of All Things.<BR>It's interesting to note that both 'The Matrix Revolutions' and `Return of the King' use choir music to great effect. I really enjoyed Don Davis excellent work on the Matrix soundtracks. The films may not have lived up to all my expectations, but the music definitely did.<br />Track 17 - Return of the King<BR>It's 10 minutes of pure Howard Shore LOTR music - which is always a major plus in my book. It's the most uplifting and optimistic track in the entire album, and it has Viggo Mortensen in it singing vocals - which really knocked me for a loop! Not to mention an excellent reprise of the Fellowship and Hobbiton themes from FOTR. Oh, and did I mention that James Galway gets to play a solo on flute? At the moment, my number one favourite track from all three films. Mostly because I've been waiting for this emotional payoff for the last three years. Excellent, outstanding stuff!<br />Track 18 - The Grey Havens &amp; Track 19 - Into the West<BR>I know you have mixed feelings about the last track (sung by Annie Lennox). I'm really pleased with it - it reflects exactly how the reader should feel at the end of ROTK. There's a sense of elation, but also a deep sense of sadness when we realise that Frodo and Bilbo are taking the Grey Ships &quot;beyond the circles of the world&quot;. The tunes used here are a radical departure from what we've heard before. There's a sense that the slate has been wiped clean, of new beginnings.<br />This is a stupendous soundtrack - required listening regardless of whether you enjoy the films or not. I wish I could've been part of the orchestra recording this wonderful music - being there for that would've been the experience of a lifetime!
0060934719|5.0|Stardust is a great book.  I have never read anything by this author, but I probably will try to find some more of his works now.  However, I would not recommend this book to younger people, since there are a couple of well-described love scenes.  I don't think that it was his intent for these scenes, that people should be mature and therefore probably for the eleventh grade and up.  This book could become a classic later on because of what it is based on.  People love well-written love stories.  That is why this book will continue to succeed.  I am glad that I had the privilege of reading this book.  If you like a fantasy love story and you don't mind a twist at the end, then you will really like this book.<br /> First, the book opens up in the village of Wall.  Wall is surrounded by different kinds of lands.  The land just beyond Wall is called Fairy.  This is a mystical land that almost anything is possible such as witches, spells, flying ships fishing for lightning bolts, and unicorns.  A man named Dunstan Thorne lives in the village of Wall.  Every nine years people from the land of Fairy come to visit the village of Wall to trade with them.  This year Dunstan was going to go to the fair.  The lat time he went, he was too young to remember.  He was in love with a woman in the village of Wall, but when the fair come he made love to a fairy woman who gave birth to a baby later on.  The woman left the baby at the village to be discovered by guards that guard the children from going into the dangerous lands of fairy.  Dunstan knew it was his, so he naturally took care of the baby boy.  He then married his love back in Wall and they said the kid was theirs.  They named the boy Tristan Thorne.  When he turns seventeen, the fair is going to come around again real soon.  He has fallen in love just like his father.  The book described the girl to be the most beautiful girl in Wall.  Her name was Victoria Forrester.  One day he got up the courage to ask her for a kiss and she said no, so he asked her to marry him instead.  She said no, but then she saw a star falling.  She told him that if he brought that star to her that she would give him his desire.  She didn't believe that he would do it, but he went home and said goodbye to his father and was on his way to find this star.  Since he was part fairy, he could understand things that took place in Fairy better than people in Wall.  When he finds the star though, it is a woman about his age, and not a rock like he had dreamt of.  During his trip in the land of Fairy, he is almost killed, rides a unicorn, talks to trees, saves a star from death, and other adventurous things.  Things happen at the end of the book, but I don't want to give it away for you.  It is very sad and then happy and so on.  The only problem with this book is that some of the things in the middle of the book don't make any sense as to why they are in there, but be patient because the end will glue all of the pieces together.d she said no, so he asked her to marry him instead.

B0000DJZA5|1.0|The original idea behind \\"Let It Be\\" was a live concert with new material.  The Beatles were to be filmed rehearsing the new material in the studio and the film's grand finale was to be the concert itself.  Thanks to the constant and uncomfortable prescence of Yoko Ono in the studio, the project went awry and The Beatles decided to film the concert on the Apple rooftop and finish the film \\"half-assed\\".<br />The album was originally titled \\"Get Back plus Don't Let Me Down and 11 other tracks\\".  It was a deliberate takeoff on the Beatles first album \\"Please Please Me Plus Love Me Do and 12 other tracks\\".  The Beatles even had themselves photographed on the \\"Please Please Me\\" apartment patio in the same postitons \\"today\\" to match the photo on Please Please Me (the photo was later used on the Beatles \\"Blue\\" Album).  \\"Get Back\\" was the Beatles attempt to \\"get back to basics\\", back to the time where the four of them just recorded in the studio \\"au naturel\\".<br />I liked the concept and \\"Let It Be--Naked\\" was a great opportunity to resurrect it. I can't understand why this opportunity was bungled so badly.  Where is \\"Teddy Boy\\"?  Where is the eight minute \\"Dig It?\\". Where is \\"The Walk\\"? What are \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" doing here--tracks Phil Spector added that were not part of the Get Back sessions? Why isn't the album called \\"Get Back\\", its original title?<br />This is just such a travesty.  I refuse to buy it or even listen to it.  It's a shame that the recorded legacy of the greatest act in music history is in the hands of the morons at Capitol Records.  They release this and we STILL can't have the first four Beatles albums in stereo!!!! What an outrage!
B00009W0WM|5.0|Along with Hithcock's Rear Window, Casablanca is extremely effective at using a single memorable set (the apartment for Rear Window and the saloon for Casablanca) for most of the film. The overall pacing of the film strikes a fine balance between character development and suspense, as it is not too long and does not lose its way, thanks to a total lack of extraneous subplots, which often hinders lesser films. Bogart's Rick is the most interesting character as he exhibits a number of traits and transformations that are paralleled in the real world, from his personal loss of a great love to apathy for a higher cause to a metamorphosis resulting in self-sacrifice that spurs others (in this case Louis) to respond in kind against evil. Throw in numerous memorable lines, some fine acting, lots of smoking and drinking that is appropriate for the circumstances rather than overdone, and some hated Nazis, and you have the makings of a timeless, atmospheric film.
B000001IPL|4.0|Smash is definitely a good album, one of the best of the 90's in my opinion. And unfortunately this is where Offspring stopped to be an alternative band, and started to totally sell-out, becoming MTV posers. Rock got cut away from their records, as dreadlocks from Dexter's hair. It's so sad when you listen to great tracks such as \\"Self Esteem\\" and immediately think of the crap they pushed out with the last two albums (in fact they've just made a new one, I couldn't listen to it yet, I'm doing it soon, but I'm really scared of what I'm going to hear...), so that by now they got even worse than Blink 182!!! So if you want to know what they were able to do nearly ten years ago, when along with Green Day they mixed punk with melody, bringing this style into the mainstream (which I think is good, the problem is how this thing has developed afterwards), buy this record without hesitation.
B000063JDE|1.0|This film is a terrible waste of celluloid.  The cinematography is extremely overrated and utterly pretentious.  It splatters colour and various &quot;unique&quot; images in an effort as to appear creative.  Subpar performances all around, except for Dennis Hopper who had some moments.  Isabella Rosellini was laughable as a depraved femme fatale, totally laughable.  It was a film that relied on its &quot;weirdness&quot; as the selling point, and as the vehicle on which to convince the viewer that this piece of garbage is somehow a good film.  The so-called weirdness grew tired and banal, because it was obnoxiously prententious and self-indulgent.  Highest Recommendation to avoid.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|..., the record company's gonna give me a lot of money and everything's gonna be alright.<BR>I keep picturing Dexter coming out from the studio at the end of the recordings singing this well-known Reel Big Fish chorus aloud, and maybe I'm not so far from the truth. It's incredible how this record sucks, but it's far more incredible that the follower is even worse, that's the reason I gave it 2 stars, and not 1. But the most annoying thing is that \\"Americana\\" seems to be nothing but a collection of \\"Smash\\" remakes. Now, I know that Offspring have their own peculiar style, and that variety of tunes is not a common trait among punk-rock bands. But here they really went too far.<BR>\\"Pretty Fly\\" is clearly the dumb version of \\"Come out and Play\\", I think everybody noticed that, so it's useless to even talk about it. But what about \\"She's Got Issues\\"? Isn't it \\"Self Esteem - Radio Edit\\"? Same verse, same chorus, even same identical structure!!!<BR>\\"Why Don't You Get a Job?\\" is nothing but the slow (and bad) version of \\"What Happened to You?\\", and look, even the titles are nearly the same, they're both questions, (maybe asked to the same person, at this point everything is possible...)<BR>The present title track is obviously similar to the former title track, the only little change is that \\"Smash\\" is the last track, \\"Americana\\" is followed by the terrible \\"Pay the Man\\".<BR>The only good track (I said good, but maybe the right word is decent) is \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\". I tried hard to think of a similar song in the previous albums, from which they may have \\"drawn inspiration\\", but I couldn't find it, so for now I'm gonna save it.<BR>The rest of the album is an unbelievable sequence of fillers, and it even features a dreadful cover (\\"Feelings\\"), just after the best track, so that your hopes are immediately destroyed.
0679642382|5.0|A quick survey of my friends who have read A.S. Byatt's novel \\"Possession\\" surprised me.  Some absolutely loved the book; others could not get through it.  This surprised me, because the novel quickly got under my skin and it stayed there.  It read on so many levels that as I was progressing through the novel, I began to plan on how to re-read it.  For example, there would be a re-reading that would concentrate on mythology and the connections of mythic creatures and stories to the worlds of \\"Possession's\\" Victorian and modern-day characters.  Then there would be the reading that sought to understand what Byatt had to say about literary theory and constructs, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism; and how the choice of a \\"romance\\" served to explore (and explode?) these late-twentieth century phenomena.  Or, there would be a reading that sought out all of the possible meanings of the book's title.  <br />Then again, perhaps I will re-read the book just to enjoy it one more time.  I found the plot to be -- excuse the word, but it seems so apt - exquisite.  (\\"...marked by flawless craftsmanship or by beautiful, ingenious, delicate, or elaborate execution...\\" - Webster)  <br />The book follows the literary research of Roland and Maud.  They uncover an unknown love relationship between a colossus, if fictional, Victorian poet, Randolph Henry Ash and a skilled contemporary Christabel LaMotte.  Working through clues and discovered letters, Roland and Maud are able to reconstruct the full depth and breadth of this relationship and begin to understand how this contributed to their poetry.  Indeed, by the time the book concludes and the final bit of evidence is \\"unearthed\\" (pun intended), all of the mysteries - of which there were many - have been settled.  All that is left is to find out what is to become of Roland and Maud.  Byatt calls the book a \\"romance;\\" can you guess?<br />Aside from the juicy plot, what I found intriguing about the book was the centrality of poetry and the rediscovery, for me, of how the poetic vision can transform life.  Life, relationships, and understanding are all heightened by the poetic connections that Ash and LaMotte are able to make as they move through their lives.  Helping to illuminate this particular reading of the book is the philosophy of Giambattista Vico, whose book \\"The New Science\\" was the residence of the initial letters discovered by Roland.  Vico's understanding of history and language and their connection to consciousness provide quite a nice framework from which to interpret Possession.  I point readers to Lynn Wells fine article in the 2002 issue of \\"MFS Modern Fiction Studies\\", in which she indicates: \\"What Vico realized was that language was not just a practical medium of communication, but rather the formative element of a culture's basic concept of reality, its very consciousness.\\" (673)  As we delve deeper and deeper into the life, poetry, letters, and language of Ash and LaMotte, we come closer to understanding the consciousness of a different time.  <br />Do not be fooled by Byatt's use of \\"romance\\" in the title. \\"Possession\\" is much more than a romance.  It is a multi-layered work that demands multiple readings.  Perhaps many books deserve a second reading; \\"Possession\\" will receive one from me because it had a plot that kept me turning pages, at the same time it had meat and substance that kept me thinking. To my great pleasure, it is the first book by Byatt that I have read.  I plan on reading all of the work from this, one of my newly found, but favorite, authors.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Never heard of Blue Grass before O' Brother...now I just can't get enough of it.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I can not say enough about this series. Season one is a MUST have for anyone who loves the show. The extras are worth it alone.

B00005JLK1|4.0|I make it a personal mission to avoid all reviews for movies.  The people who are paid to write them are usually very jaded people, who have seen too many movies, so pretty much every movie is ruined for them.<br />Anyway, I'm glad that I'm like this because if I wasn't, I would have avoided this movie like the plague.  I agree that the movie offers nothing new to the haunted _____ (fill in the blank) genre, but it definitely was worth the ticket price.  Not only was the acting beyond all ghost stories (due to its spectacular actors), but the visuals and soundtrack intensify your viewing pleasure.<br />It's not so much of a \\"scary movie\\" but more of a mystery or gore movie.  If you're into movies that have a lot of gore and blood, this is your movie.  You can instantly tell this when the story begins.  A hand pulls a lever causing a rope to slice dancing couples in half.  Brutal, sharp, painful, and most of all, quick.<br />The scene then goes onto the main characters (Gabriel Byrne, Julianna Margulies, Desmond Harrington, Ron Eldard, Isaiah Washington, Karl Urban, Alex Dimitriades).  They are approached by Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) who recruits them to help him investigate a mysterious vessel he found off the coast of Alaska.  Once the crew is on the ship, they start sensing that there is something wrong afoot.  But since they're in international waters, proclaiming the ship theirs, their love for money keeps them searching through the ship to uncover its mysteries.  Do they all die in equally horrible and brutal fashions as the ship's long deceased passengers?  I know, but no way am I telling you.  Go watch it.
0790742780|5.0|Michael Douglas as a nerd-gone-psychotic...living at home with his totally oblivious mother...flashbacks of his  wife and child who could not stand the &quot;horsey&quot; he made her ride when she was a toddler....<br />Robert Duvall's shrew wife demanding he be home on time for dinner.....and going ballistic when his female partner answers his phone...<br />This film has it's stereotypes, but it was entertaining. I especially liked the fast food restaurant scene, when MD demanded BREAKFAST! Also when he went up on the freeway demanding the DOT workers to answer &quot;why&quot; the road was being torn up.....his bungling of the rocket launcher (and the kid telling him how to fire it) was totally comical!<br />Ahhh, Michael, what a gorgeous NERD you made! ;)
B00009TB5G|1.0|This movie failed to allow me to ignore my lost job, girl friend and empty sense of self. I couldn't relate to any of the characters which kept me from projecting myself onto a character leading a magical, meaningful life that I will never lead.<br />P.S. Star trek rules
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said. (This album is wonderful, 10 times better than the original, etc).  All the songs are great, but no one has given props to my all time favorite A. Keys song (to date) SLOW DOWN.  I love this song, I play it over and over, and when I'm not playing it, (like at work) I'm thinking about when I'm going to play it again.  It is soulful, sexy and sophicticated.  It embodies the struggles one goes through when they want to take it \\"there\\" with a special person, but the timing is not right.  Within the \\"moment\\", you feel like you're down for whatever, but you recall that you've been through this before and you don't want to get hurt again. It like a war between body and mind. You hear that at the end of the song when Alicia whispers \\"you got to slow down\\". She really doesn't want to but she has to. This song maybe \\"simple\\" in comparison to the other great tracks,but you don't need a lot of production to get a message out there. Maybe no one else got it but me, but I can definately relate to this song.
B00006879E|5.0|I liked the band well before they were famous when my brother saw the band at a side stage at some music festival and then talked to them. Now that they are mainstream, I don't feel cool anymore about liking them. However, the cd is good with a nice variety of songs so I give them  5 stars.
B000050FEN|5.0|Wow, I just read a review from a top 1,000 reviewer, and he said nobody should see this movie, he wouldn't recommend it, and he would never watch it again.  What's the matter?  Did ya vomit after every scene?  These top 500 and top 1000 reviewers piss me off.  They don't even get paid to review these movies, and yet they still trash them like they're the caliber of Roger Ebert.  Wake up call.<br />Here we go, if you haven't seen this movie, you either: A. Have a low tolerance for the grotesque, B. You don't like suspense films, or C. you read some retard's review about how no one should see this movie.  If you said C, congrats, your a retard as well.  I can understand A and B, I have no beef with them, but it's the C category that pisses me off.<br />So as not to completely miss the point, I will now review this movie.<br />The best movie EVER and I do mean EVER.  The only movie that comes close is Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, but that's a different review for a different time.<br />Tell me the plot you ask?  No, why give away the plot to the best movie ever?  Does that make sense people?  No, I will tell you though, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give believable and truly stunning performances.  Keven Spacey shows why he is one of the best out there.  Paltrow's role, though small, is well acted and thoroughly believable.<br />Now your asking me, what is the movie about?  No, you won't get it out of me, the plot is too good.  If you seriously know nothing about this movie, perfect, buy it, watch it, love it.  I have this DVD, and I have watched well over 20 times, probably more, it's just that good (also I have a high tolerence for the grotesque, which is why I can watch &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; repeatedly, another great film by genius film maker Oliver Stone).  Stop asking me what the plot is and buy the DVD, well worth your money, trust me, when it comes to good movies, I don't lie.
6304698623|5.0|Our family loves this story. We like this version and the original also. I think this version has better acting and script for the &quot;little princess&quot; and does not concern itself with too many side stories. In this story Sarah must live in a boarding school away from the land she loves (India) and the man she loves (her father). It is difficult enough for a lively girl with a big imagination to thrive in the stifling school, but when Sarah's circumstances change for the worse her imagination, belief in magic and determination serve her well. This movie will pull at your heartstrings and inspire you; I would give it 10 starts if I could.
B000089RVX|5.0|My friend made me listen to this CD while we were waiting in line at 1 in the morning for HP5, and I was blown away with their single, &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; I've been obsessed for a while now!<br />song-by-song review:<BR>Going Under: 7/10 face it-this song is fun to rock to.<br />Bring Me To Life: 4/10 this is my least favorite song on the CD now that I've heard the other music there. it's overplayed, which is part of the reason i don't like it, and I just don't think it compares to some of the others on here.<br />Everybody's Fool: 5/10 it's a fun song, cool lyrics, but it doesn't really stand out.<br />My Immortal: 10/10 there is nothing i can fault about this song-it is absolutely beautiful. Amy's voice is amazing, hitting the high and the low notes perfectly. the score is wonderful too.<br />Haunted: 6/10 this isn't one of my favorites, but it is-fittingly-haunting. <br />Tourniquet: 5/10 It feels like this is one of evenescence's earlier songs-they have lots of DEATH and not very much metaphor, which is part of what makes them unique in their other songs (in my opinion)<br />Imaginary 7/10 the metaphor and imagery I was talking about? it's here. this is a great song, what more can i say?<br />Taking Over Me: 6/10 this is the song I listen to the least on the CD-and now that I think about it, I don't know why...I guess I should go listen to it.<br />Hello-9/10 this song does not get the attention it deserves. it's calm, quiet, and sends chills down your spine.<br />My Last Breath: 8/10 nifty song. <br />Whisper: 5/10 another fun one to just rock your brains out to.<br />lots of people say Evanescence is a poser band. maybe they are- but I don't care! if you love a band's music, why care about their image? that's their problem. I guess I just go for the fake goth rock.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well, anti-Britney fans should listen to this CD! It's the best one yet that Brit has put on the market. I give thumbs up to this girl for being brave enough to tell it like it is and not stick to songs about crushes on boys. Haven't we heard enough of that? She's back and she's hear to stay. JUST GET THE CD!!
B000096I9G|5.0|The three best Cure albums (OK, maybe Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me should be in there) are now on a 2 DVD set and performed live.  The sound quality is excellent and obviously the songs are quite good.  Another positive is that the set makes the Pornography album sound a bit updated-- the original 1982 CD sounds like it was recorded in, well, 1982.  Electronic drums and things like that.<br />It is a lot to take in in one sitting though, and they are not exactly the happiest songs that Smith and Co. perform.  Still, the only problem to me is that the bassline in \\"Strange Day\\" sounds grossly out of tune to my ear, and some of the visual effects on the songs are distracting.  I guess you have to do that to liven up the atmosphere a bit though.<br />Arguably the best part of the DVD is not any of the songs they perform in the main set, but the encore in which they close with \\"The Kiss\\".  You get a whole new appreciation for that song seeing it live.
B00008DDXC|1.0|This movie blows.  Hermione is going to be smokin' when she gets past puberty, but other than thinking about her, this movie (and the first) is a total waste of time.  The characters and ideas are directly ripped off from Neil Gaiman's Books of Magic character Timothy Hunter.  The storytelling is SLOOOW, the dialog is a little ridiculous, and that little Weasley boy is the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar and the Oracle.  Props for getting kids to read and what not, but these ideas aren't that original.  Hurry up and get this fad over with.  Buy something that matters like the original Books of Magic series or the Family Guy DVD's.
B00003CXA2|5.0|When I first saw the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in a theater in 1994, I knew that director Robert Zemeckis had created a heart-warming masterpiece that would more than likely earn it Oscar recognition, and it certainly did.  The endearing film follows the life of an educationally challenged man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) from the time of his childhood (played by Michael Conner Humphreys) until early middle age.  His mother (Sally Field) made sure that he would be treated just like everyone else so that he could take care of himself once she was gone.  In addition to his learning disability, Forrest was required to wear leg braces as a child that made him the target of ridicule from other children, except for one girl named Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall).  However, Forrest quickly discovered that his legs weren't that bad when he found an innate ability to run.  When Forrest decided to join the U.S. Army, he meets his two best friends: a fellow recruit named Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).  Bubba loved to talk about shrimp and Lt. Dan was raised to be a soldier.  Forrest's relationship with Jenny, as well as his relationships with Bubba and Lt. Dan, led Forrest down several unexpected paths that allowed him to meet several pivotal historical figures.<br />Tom Hanks' superb performance as the loveable Forrest Gump earned him his well-deserved second Oscar for Best Actor.  (He had previously won the Oscar for Best Actor for the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and has been nominated three other times.)  Robert Zemeckis also earned the Oscar for Best Director, and the film itself won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing.  Gary Sinise earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, in addition to six other Oscar nominations that included Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Sound.  Part of what &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; so endearing was Zemeckis' use of superimposing actors into actual, historical film footage.  This footage included the late Pres. John F. Kennedy, the late John Lennon, the late Pres. Richard M. Nixon, and the late former Alabama Gov. George Wallace to name a few.  (Robert Zemeckis used this same archival footage technique again in the 1997 film &quot;Contact&quot;.)  Other memorable characters in the film include school bus driver Dorothy Harris (Siobhan Fallon), Bubba's mother (Marlena Smalls), Abbie Hoffman (Richard D'Alessandro) and Forrest Gump Jr. (Haley Joel Osment).<br />Some of the many memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes, running with leg braces, running across the football field during practice, scenes at the University of Alabama, boot camp, Vietnam, D.C., NYC, the shrimping boat, running across America, and the scenes with Jenny (both as child and adult).  I regard &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as one of the best films ever made and rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's the kind of film that draws the viewer into its story and keeps the viewer engaged throughout its 142 minutes.  I highly recommend the DVD version of the film to everyone, and the second DVD is good with its various documentaries and other material.  Tom Hanks went on to star in many more memorable film roles, including his roles in &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cast Away&quot; (2000) to name a few.  Unfortunately, many of Gary Sinise's film roles that followed have been far less memorable.
B000002C1W|5.0|Those who compare Pink Floyd without Roger Waters to the Chicago Bulls without Michael Jordan are way off. Granted that lyrics since his departure were never again what they were before, musically speaking Pink Floyd continued to be very well and alive thereafter, and a proof of it is this album, as well as portions of The Division Bell that followed it a few years after.<br />From the brilliant opening instrumental (&quot;Signs Of Life&quot;), the album moves into the powerful &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; and a string of tracks that prove that David Gilmour's guitar can bring just as much life to the 3+ decade-old band as it did back in their prime time. If you doubt this, the closing &quot;Sorrow&quot; should be helpful. All in all, the album has a very spatial feel to it, deserving to be listened to with headphones in order to disect the layers and layers of sound that it has to offer beyond the casual listening stage.<br />I highly recommend it as the &quot;new&quot; Pink Floyd sound (of the late eighties and early nineties), more focused on the music than the lyrics, yet every bit as brilliant and powerful.
B000089RVX|3.0|I must admit, when I first got this CD I absolutely loved it. I thought it was great, like nothing I had ever heard before. But then again, I rarely used to listen to music. Now, I rarely listen to this CD. It's almost difficult to differentiate between songs, and, I think, the slow songs are painful to listen to. And now Evanescence is way too mainstream. Everyone is going on about how phenomenal this group is and, frankly, I find it very annoying.<br />But, this group is not all bad. Through Amazon.com's reccomendations i was able to find other, *better* bands like Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Nightwish, and Artrosis (which I *highly* recommend, providing you don't mind listening to Polish music, and you can actually get ahold of one of their CDs).<br />That's basically it. If you like mainstream music, go with Evanescence. If you want something more beautiful, meaningful, and overall better, I recommend Nightwish, Artrosis, Tristania, and/or Lacuna Coil. Trust me, you won't regret it.
B00005YUNY|5.0|YES IS ONE OF THE BEST GROUPS FROM THE 70'S AND NOW THEY HAVE ONE OF THE BEST CONCERT DVD TO PROVE IT.THE SOUND AND THE VIDEO ARE GREAT AND THAT ORCHESTRA, THEY ARE HAVING A LOT OF FUN.FEW GROUPS HAVE ACHIEVED SUCH A PERFECT BLEND WITH A SYMPHONIC ORCHESTRA.THE SONG SELECTION IS PERFECT ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ARE FROM YES GOLDEN ERA,(YES ALBUM,FRAGILE,CLOSE TO THE EDGE) AND THE GROUP IS PLAYING WITH THE SKILLS AND FEROCITY OF THE  YESSONGS DAYS.A MUST HAVE DVD.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This ablum is undoubtly a hit... whether or not you liked it.  I am surprised that it evokes such passionate and extreme opinions.  Did you notice that all the ratings are either 5 stars- LOVED IT!!! or 1 star- HATED IT!!!  <br />As an avid Britney fan, the album is a fun one.  It's a good CD when you're getting ready to go out to the bars or clubs.  All the songs have a strong beat and make you want to jump up and dance.  It's v. euro-techno-ish.  <br />I am surprised and a little disappointed that Britney didn't include more pop-style songs that we all loved in her previous albums!!  I adore Every Time, though. :)<br />Get the album.  It's not the best but it will be among the favorites in your collection.
B00005LOUP|1.0|First off, some context: I'm a huge Dr. Seuss fan, as is my daughter.  Do I love How the Grinch Stole Christmas?  Yes.  A lot.  The book and the animated movie.  Will I let my daughter see this live-action version?  No.  To be fair, Jim Carrey does a great job as the Grinch.  The makeup is fantastic, and Carrey's mannerisms really bring life to the Grinch character.  But there's only so much you can do with a brutal script.  As others have mentioned, this film is loud.  Very loud.  And the script completely abandons the whole point of Seuss' tale...in the book, the Grinch is moved by the Who's unselfish attitude and comes to love Christmas.  In the film, it is the Grinch who must set the materialistic Who's back on track.  Also, the back story about the Grinch becoming a loner because he was the subject of classroom ridicule is ridiculous and insulting.  Skip this movie (and The Cat In The Hat which suffers similar problems) and see the original animated feature or better yet, read the book.
B00005JMCW|5.0|One of the best movie of the year. I loved the movie, it dose a really good job of making it look like they were a really family. I fight with my mom all of the time, and see hates the way a dress. It isn't bad, but she says it is not her tasted. At some point in time thou Mothers and daughters reach a under standing of each other. It sends out the measage of even if you don't get along some day you will.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|One of the things I liked best about the song &quot;Let it be&quot; on the original album was the driving guitar solo that made it much more powerful than the 45rpm single.   The version included on LIBN sounds more like the single -- sweet, hymnlike, lots of organ.  The version on the original Let It Be album, I suspect, was one John Lennon would have preferred -- sounds more like a rock band.
B00005JM0B|3.0|Can't put my finger on it, but this movie lacks the magic of previous Terminators. (Maybe it's &quot;character development.&quot;) Maybe I should have watched it in the theater. The special effects are OK. (As with all special effects today, they still look a little cartoonish and rubbery -- a bit too fluid to be fully believable.) Arnold's acting skills have diminished. The female terminator is just not scary enough. John Connor does not come across as much of a leader. (The kid in T2 was a more gutsy character, IMHO.) I didn't watch the deleted scenes because the movie didn't wow me enough to make me want to watch them. And clearly, scenes have been deleted, because characters jump from place to place with little explanation. (Reminds me of &quot;Broken Arrow.&quot;) The movie is still worth watching -- so you'll be able to follow T4, if there is one. You'll get a chuckle here and there. You'll maybe feel a little squirt of adrenaline flow from time to time. And the writers for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; will get plenty of material for future Terminator/Arnold spoofs.
0679428895|5.0|True historical fiction is a rare genre.  Historical fantasy is very common.  But the ability to truly recreate a moment in time as it might have been is rare.  In his previous book, Fatherland, Harris showed his ability to create historical fantasy.  Now, he is warmed-up and wants to show that he can create historical fiction.  And that is exactly what he does.<br />In Pompeii Harris recreates the days before the eruption of 79 AD that destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.  He does this by telling the story of Marcus Attilius Primus, an engineer who takes over the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that brings water to the area around Vesuvius, when the previous engineer disappears.  As he deals with maintaining the aqueduct and learning the politics of leadership, Attilius comes face to face with the earth's--and human's--warning that will lead to the eruption and what follows.<br />There are many things I like about this book.  First, despite the fact that we know exactly what's going to happen big picture here (Vesuvius is going to erupt), Harris is able to keep us interested and excited.  Second, we get a feeling that, although we know this is fiction, this is something that could have happened.  It is not pure fantasy in an historical setting.  Finally, Harris has the ability to create characters that we care about.<br />Admittedly, Harris has chosen a subject in which I am very interested.  The eruption of Vesuvius has long fascinated me and a few years ago I traveled to Italy to tour the ruins of Pompeii.  It was very fun for me to read this book and get a feeling for what that time was like.  This novel hit no false notes with me.  If anything, I wish Harris had been willing to carry the novel past the eruption farther into the aftermath.  That said, I think anyone who enjoys historical fiction will find a lot to like here.
B000063DFW|5.0|All Lp fans should get this CD if they are a true linkin park fan even though u do'nt even have to get this one just get the reg. one. the good thing is that i got this one for 20 bucks ! it's a good CD and here's a weird thing....The reg. one at this store (keepin' it annonymous cuz i want too) was 20 bucks and the special edition one was the SAME PRICE , and i  was shocked by that so  i just grabbed it and bought it <BR>this cd is great!  and if u are looking forward to join LPU <BR>(LInkin park underground) official fan club of linkin park u should ! just go to [...] for more info about the fan club!<br />:)
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Without a doubt this was much better than the original.Better characters are introduced and there is alot of action.The first movie was slow and had characters which were boring and pointless.The plot is good and the acting is really good.I would recommend getting this one because it kicks ass.
B00003CXBK|5.0|There are few films that are really worth owing and this film is one of them. Considered as a cult classic for anime fans worldwide, Princess Mononoke is actually a very accesible, profound and beautiful film that even non anime advocates will enjoy. The animation is simply breathtaking while the storyline is rich and complex, if you really appreciatte good movies then this is one for you.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I hate this cd. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the song &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; is pretty cool. This sounds so much like The White Stripes, but way crappier. This cd sucks!
B000002U82|5.0|This is Probably the best album of all time. I am 14 right now and i didnt grow up listening to this, but I just recently bought it and it has grown on me instantly. Dark side of the moon is just immaculate and perfect on every level of its music. you have to listen to it with headphones on because there is so much going on in this album. <BR>A Magnum Opus for all time.
B00005JM02|5.0|I really loved Finding Nemo. I see there is a lot of fun extra stuff on the DVD so I'm totally convinced that every kid should see this and I'm sure that the parents will enjoy it also. It is a very good present not only for Christmas but for every occasion - it has humor, heart and a lot of excellent computer graphics which alone is a good reason for viewing this animation. And the vivid colourful underwater world was just breathtaking!
B000002J1M|5.0|I'm part of a minority among art rock fanatics, that being the ones that are fifteen years of age.  Over the past few years I've been slowly, then quite quickly, been swimming into this genre of music.  I'd been a King Crimson fan for some time, then became a big fan of ELP, then an older aquaintance of mine told me to listen to a band called Genesis.  I wanted to, but hadn't the source at the time.  <br />My first sample of them was Nursery Cryme's highlight, The Musical Box; I was hooked!   I bought album after album, but this one remains my absolute favorite.  Foxtrot is simply my favorite art rock album, and possibly my favorite album.
B0000028UK|5.0|First,lemme start off saying this album is simply amazing,and by argueably the best PJ album.Every single song,from start to finish is very enjoyable!This is exactly what the crappy rock music of today is missing...In fact so many bands have tried to rip off PJ,(such as Creed,etc.),but it just aint happening.The Seattle Grunge era of the 1990's was grunge/modern rocks time to shine,and right before todays rock evolved into this new kinda of genre,which I cant stand.There is no comparison btwn todays bands and bands such as alice in chains,soundgarden,nirvana,metallica(old)smashing pumpkins,stone temple pilots,etc...there just isnt!Pearl Jam is everything a great rock band should be ...their songs bring out so much emotion,while captivating the body and soul.They work so well together as a team.They have been together for 10 plus years,and at least they didnt sell out like METALLICA did.The best thing about the band is that no album is exactly alike.The band's songwriting skills really start to show,particullary in songs such as &quot;rats&quot;,man what a song!...With one of the world's best vocalists,Vedder and the boys display pure power,and leaves nothing to be desired.Theres no other Pj album like this one,thats what makes it so damn good.Just let the whole cd play and trust me you wont get tired of it,at least I didnt.This album helped me through some very rough times of my life,those I'll never forget,THANK YOU PJ!<BR>If you dont have it go get it right now!What are ya waiting for?GO!<br />Highlights of this album<br />go-animal-daughter-small town-dissident-glorified g-rats
6303160344|5.0|The film can be seen in different levels, beautifully acted by the Juliet Binoche. It has great piece of cinematography, and use of lights to portray emotions and state of mind.<BR>On one level, the film is about a woman, in early 30s, lost her husband (a renowned composer) and her child in an accident. Devastated by the loss, she tried to deny her past and shelved herself in solitary existence. She occasionally tested herself, to test her capacity to feel, with failure, desperate to forget his past, left her family house, instructed her attorney to make arrangement to sell the house, and settled in a small, cozy parisan apartment. She lived in her apartment, away from everybody. Her only contacts to the world was her mother an Alzheimer patient, living in an old age home. A live contrast with her present situation, when she is trying to forget her past, her mother, an Alzheimer patient living with a permanent oblivious memory. She eventually comes back to accept her existence through series of events that unfolds. In another plane the film is about connection. One is living so long he/she can connect to his/her surroundings. In the caf, when she listens to the tune of the flutist, which he claimed to invent alone, the tune which is similar to composition that her husband was working, immediately connects her to her husband, her loss and present state of mind. This was beautifully displayed by niece piece of cinematography, as lights and shades goes warmer and warmer, when she started connecting the tune to herself. There are similar pieces in the story, which again forces her to connect to her world, her associations and so forth. The theme was nicely projects in the last scene, when the images of the different characters, association passed floating on the screen. These connections allowed her to rejuvenate the will to live. Kieslowski's various other movies, like RED, Double Life of Veronica, centered around this theme of strange human connections, not very obvious, but in certain metaphysical plane. In this context his films actually took a flight in a spiritual plane. The meaning of human existence is in connection with the surroundings. It can transcends the life from pain and sufferings.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|i didn't buy her new cd but i've listened to it online because i don't want to waste money on a good for nothing cd. I really don't know what she is trying to express in her music. I really think it's ridiculous on how she got so big. Wow she got big on her first album because someone wrote her songs big deal. Now she has something to do with it now oh please. You know who's great and talented? people like Alicia keys. She has such a god given voice to match the talent that goes with the gift of playing the piano. Everytime I listen to Alicia keys' lyrics, I feel like she knows what i'm going through. So what if she ain't got no music to dance and jam to. At least she ain't fake. Britney is just another marketing idea for dumb teenage girls to be just like her. Besides what kind of girl sends her private jet miles and miles away for a stupid cup of coffee. She should really invested on more singing lessons, more acting lessons, and maybe some education. Hey maybe then she'll come up with good lyrics. Hey I've taken the time to listen to britney now brit fans gotta listen to alicia's lastest album.
B000003S09|5.0|In The Court Of The Crimson KIng is a touchstone of a genre of rock music that has not produced anything as good since. Just the cover alone was bold enough. But the arrangements, instrumentation, concept and lyrics made me at the age of 14 feel like I was really smart and had great taste. &quot;21st Century Schzoid Man&quot; sounds like it should be covered by Marilyn Manson. The title song has brilliant imagery and one of the best outros ever in rock. This record is dark, mythical, and unique and something I thought I outgrew, but no dice. It's in my iPod.
B000002UUH|4.0|Here is a collection of the late great John Lennon's post-Beatles compositions and recordings. However,the first track GIVE PEACE A CHANCE was recorded in 1969 during the Beatles era. Lennon was still in songwriting partnership with fellow Beatle Paul McCartney. So the song's writing credit is listed as Lennon-McCartney although Lennon personally penned it. WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT is from 1974's WALLS AND BRIDGES and has Elton John joining Lennon. From that same album is #9 DREAM. There's a cover of STAND BY ME previously recorded by Ben E. King,whose version was a big hit as well. LOVE is from 1970's PLASTIC ONO BAND. From 1971's IMAGINE is the title track,which would inspire the docuentary motion picture of the same name 17 years later, and JEALOUS GUY. From MIND GAMES is the title track. From 1980's DOUBLE FANTASY are (JUST LIKE)STARTING OVER,I'M LOSING YOU,WOMAN,DEAR YOKO,WATCHING THE WHEELS and BEAUTIFUL BOY. There's also the 1969 hit HAPPY XMAS(WAR IS OVER). How could that be? The Vietnam War had not yet ended. It carried on for another six years. Did Lennon assume in '69 the Vietnam war ended? The legendary entertainer was murdered in December 1980 outside his then-residence,the Dakota Apartments in New York City. He was only 40 years old. Only several hours before the murder,Lennon's killer had requested and autograph from the entertainer. The killer's request was granted. I dedicate this album to Lennon's memory. This was Lennon's first posthumous release(in 1982 and re-issued on CD in '89).
0312263120|4.0|Here's the problem: Digital Fortress has a good plot, but it's filled with weak characters.  I really liked the plot.  A disgruntled NSA employee develops an unbreakable encryption program (the Digital Fortress) and threatens to give both the encryption program and the key (which is buried in the program) away on the Internet. If the bad guys gain access to the key, they will be able to communicate without fear of the NSA decrypting their messages. This throws the NSA into a panic - as it should - so they send David Becker to track down the former employee.  However, David learns that the man has died in suspicious circumstances, so ... well, you know.<br />Pretty good so far, but now consider the main characters.  Susan Fletcher and David Becker are the perfect pair.  She's beautiful, intelligent, sexy and decent to the core.  He's beautiful, intelligent, sexy and - yes - decent to the core.  Although Susan has an IQ of 170, she's mostly eye candy.  The only surprise was that nobody tied her to railroad tracks in front of an oncoming train.  Although that might have improved her characterization.  David, on the other hand turns out to be the greatest daredevil of all time, outwitting a professional assassin, even though the most exciting thing he has done is to thrash an opponent on a squash court (and then treat him to a fruit shake and bagel).  There's another character known only as Jabba ... enough said?<br />Okay, so what's the bottom line?  This clearly isn't a top-level thriller, but if your plans fall through some weekend, this wouldn't be a bad book to pick up.
B00005JMTN|5.0|There is something exhilarating about riding two trains and running 27 blocks down the street to see a movie.  Living 8 or so miles outside New York City has its perks for one of my new jobs.  Going to press screenings of yet to released blockbusters.  It's just to bad I'm at the mercy of the New Jersey Transit rail system.  With delayed trains and lots of snow covering the ground of course I had 10 minutes to get from Madison Square Garden to Union Square.  No small feat if you ask me.<br />But as I settled down in my chair at the Regal Union Square, and as I sipped on the sweet nectar of the drink called COKE, a film unfolded.  A film so good, it made my mad dash to the theater worth every minute and as I reminisce about the filmed triumph that is BIG FISH, I feel a sense of awe and wonder.  Tim Burton has created a film better than EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a film that is worthy of Oscar.<br />William Bloom (Billy Crudup, Waking The Dead) is mad at his father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney,Erin Brockovich).  You see his dad loves to tell stories about his youth.  Except none of them seem true.  Stories of Giants named Karl (Matthew McGrory, Bubble Boy), Circus Freaks, wandering poets, Siamese Twins from Red China, bank robberies, a witch, and a really big fish.  William longs to meet the real man behind all the stories.  But when Edward is stricken with cancer, William comes face to face with the man, both the real one and the legend.<br />BIG FISH is the kind of movie where a new surprise is hiding around every corner.  From babies being spit across the hospital floor to a classic car being submerged underwater.  The frame is jammed with visions both colorful and humorous.  I especially liked the witch whose one eye could tell you how you would die.  What an eerie and yet oddly beautiful old woman she was.<br />I also loved the tender moment that Edward and his wife Sandy (Jessica Lange, Titus) had in the bathtub.  It's a scene full of both raw emotion and sweet reflection.  Here's a woman who's watching the man she loves die right in front of her face.  Every moment counts, and every word and breath sacred.<br />Ewan MacGregor (Star Wars: Attack of the Cloans) does a fine job as young Edward the adventurous youth of all his older counterpoint fantastical stories.  His performance strikes the right cords at the right moments, allowing the audience to take hold of a man who may be the fabrication or the true version of a man who's telling the story.<br />Tim Burton's directing is top notch.  He's proven that he's a master of the visual image, and BIG FISH is the perfect film to allow people to sit up and take notice.  He strikes the right cord between humor and tears, joyous circus's and scary forests.  His deft eye even takes us behind enemy lines.  In a scene that is both inspired and quirky all at the same time.<br />BIG FISH is also a film about heritage.  What's more important in the scheme of things, how we lived or how people remember us? It's a little of both, and this film puts us right in the middle of it all.  Watching a life unfold around us.<br />BIG FISH is the reason I love going to the movies.  Sure sometimes you have to dig through the trash to find a gem and this is a gem of a motion picture.  If you see one film at all this year BIG FISH is worth a trip, even a whirlwind 27-block sprint to your local theater.eflection.

B00005LQ04|3.0|Like many others here, I bought Suspiria solely on the hype it has received as 'one of the greatest horror films of all time'.  I am a huge fan of the genre and do enjoy other films by Argento, but after watching Suspiria I had no sense of it being even remotely close to one of the greatest horror films of all time.<br />The film is beautifully shot, as has been stated by others, the use of color is stunning and consistent throughout.  The score is great as well.  But the plot is fairly thin and the acting is average at best.  Some of the effects were somewhat cheesy also, like the scene with dog attacking the piano player.  Clearly it could be seen that this was a mannequin, and a poorly constructed one at that.  The blood used looked like fingernail polish and nothing like actual blood.<br />With that said, Suspiria is definitely worth a look.  I purchased it and am happy to have it as a part of my collection.  But when you stand this movie next to classics like 'The Exorcist', 'Halloween', 'Black Christmas', or 'Carrie' it simply doesn't measure up.
B00005QDW1|3.0|The songs are great party songs! That's what this album is about.<BR>People keep referencing hip-hop, which is true- it is influenced by it.<BR>But here's the thing:<BR>No Doubt barely touched on the ska sound. They had a punk/ska sound created by the former Operation Ivy. Ska is Jamaican jazz. Did No DOubt ever sound &quot;jazzy&quot;? No.<br />Now they're touching on Jamaican dancehall. The intro, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is certainly the most rock steady song on the disc.<BR>Dancehall is Jamaica's answer to hip-hop.  The MC's there are referred to &quot;DJ's&quot;. Funny.<BR>But of course, hip-hop is influenced by Jamaican &quot;toasting&quot; (think Shaggy).<br />So there's some history for ya'll.<br />It's a good modern party album.

0393307050|1.0|I attempted reading several of his books.  I found them boring and the language stilted. <br />Many authors use the vocabulary of a time and place without making the characters come alive.  It is all just a jumble of words strung together over many pages.  I sensed no excitement or adventure in his books.  To my mind such authors do not really understand what it was like to sail or fight a ship or what motivated people and how they related to one another.<br />On the other hand, Alexander Kent, a British writer, published a series about Richard Bolitho and now writes about his nephew, Adam Bolitho. Mostly during the time of Napoleon.  They are enthralling.  There is a minimum of jargon.  You learn much about sailing ships and the conditions of those who served in them as well as about the society of the day.  They are first of all sea adventure tales. They are both exciting and absorbing. There is some romance but these are mostly about men and their lives at sea together.  This author also writes World War II sea adventure tales under the name Douglas Reeman.  Pick your time period.  I highly recommend both of them.<br />I retired from the public library field after more than thirty years.  I recognize the popularity of Mr. O'Brian.  Tastes in reading differ.  I just found it impossible to read his books.  Especially after reading the Hornblower and Bolitho novels.

6304712944|5.0|In this lavish adaptation of the Broadway musical based on T.H. White's modern classic \\"The Once and Future King,\\" the music of Frederick Loewe and Lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner weave this story into an intricate tapestry of unforgettable heart-stirring emotions. The emotions are quite overpowering and you almost have to watch this movie three times to fully appreciate the texture and detail of the 45 sets and 3,500 costumes.<br /><br />Camelot is a timeless romantic drama that takes us to a medieval world that could only be imagined in your most romantic fantasy. The humor is witty, the music is unforgettable and the world of Camelot has castle scenes that are beyond compare. In fact, if you love castles, you will see scenes from dreamy castles in Spain. The Castle of Camelot is modeled after the Castle of Coca. The architectural details in the design are partly Romanesque, Norman, Viking and Gothic. The decorations have a \\"fantasy\\" medieval flavor.<br /><br />The movie is at first shrouded in mystery as Arthur sits in a dark misty forest. Arthur is about to go into battle and doesn't want to die in a state of confusion. Merlin advises Arthur to think back to the time when he met Guenevere.<br /><br />We are transported into King Arthur's memory, where the entire story takes place in vivid detail. King Arthur sings about his fears of the wedding night and it is all rather cute and humorous. We instantly see King Arthur as an eternal boy and later find out how he became king quite by accident when he draws the sword, Excalibur, out of a stone.<br /><br />Guenevere arrives all wrapped in fur as she travels through the \\"most ferocious, savage, terrifying forest\\" she has ever seen. The branches are laden with snow and icicles. She simply adores the danger and beauty. When she hears the forest is quite dangerous, she wishes to be stolen away. Her heart is quite hungry for adventure and romance as a damsel in distress and all she has to look forward to is an arranged marriage.<br /><br />When she meets \\"Wart\\" she has no idea he is King Arthur and asks him to run away with her. Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris are like two happy children living in a magical dream. King Arthur has a boyish charm, plenty of witty lines and the almost periwinkle eye shadow quite matches his turtleneck sweater and promotes a whimsical mood.<br /><br />The royal marriage is magnificent and the wedding gown flows between two seas of candles. For a time, we truly believe this arranged marriage will succeed. Arthur shares his dreams of uniting the feudal city-states and Guenevere seems intrigued with her husband's leadership qualities. She too seems to be dreaming of a new world filled with chivalrous knights who fight for right.<br /><br />When French knight Sir Lancelot arrives, he destroys the intimacy between Guenevere and King Arthur, although he promises to be the king's defender in this newly civilized world. Guenevere becomes a woman who must make impossible decisions. Lancelot dreams of all the good he can do, all the wrongs he can right and in fact, his desires lead him to a place where a fragile utopia is destroyed.<br /><br />\\"Camelot\\" then becomes a serious study in how three people are almost forced to make irreversible decisions. King Arthur (Richard Harris) seems to quickly go into an extended period of denial and since he deeply loves Guenevere, he forgives her for being human. Lancelot (Franco Nero) lives life intensely and feels deeply about King Arthur's mission. He is filled with a passion for life and makes promises he can hardly keep once he enters Guenevere's world.<br /><br />Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave) is so innocent in her love of both King Arthur and Lancelot. She falls madly in love with Lancelot because he embodies all that she has always dreamed of, despite the fact that their love now destroys Lancelot's chivalrous ideals. He fights for her and his impressive battle skills and depth of emotion after he fights in the joust draws her into his world. Each time they look at one another, the world stands still and in awe of this love they feel for one another. If only she had met Lancelot before she had been promised to King Arthur.<br /><br />I doubt there is a more powerfully erotic and yet angelic scene than the one where Guenevere stands in the doorway with her golden hair flowing behind her in the drafty castle. This scene portrays her in an almost angelic way as \\"If Ever I Would Leave You\\" plays on, drawing us into an intimate circle created by three hearts who are forever woven into this immortal tale.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|I don't know if it's because I just bought it, but it seems I like this album more than \\"Songs in A minor\\". \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" sees a soft songs tracklisting that improves \\"Songs in A minor\\". Though I like R&B, and this is not exactly R&B. This album keeps its tracks on a soft old school soul and an eclectic and dry, old school too, hip-hop. And that's right, AK's debut had more R&B songs, as \\"Girlfriend\\", \\"Mr. Man\\", \\"Jane Doe\\"... The songs that get closer to R&B in this diary are maybe \\"Samsonite man\\", \\"Wake up\\" and \\"So simple\\". And also the other hip-hop ones, as the Timbaland-produced \\"Heartburn\\" and the soulful \\"Karma\\". The review:<br />01.Harlem's nocturne. It could be better if it wasn't an intro. A very strong piano-laced track. (8/10)<br />02.Karma. Also a hard beat, inserted with smooth vocals and piano orgasms. (9/10)<br />03.Heartburn. Timbaland makes here a good beat, though it's not his typical music it's very good. Alicia lays over this old school hip-hop track with her soulful vocals and shouts. (9/10)<br />04.If I was your woman/Walk on by. A genuine soul track, the worse thing here it's its last (only 3.06 min). Good mid-tempo. (9/10)<br />05.You don't know my name. Obviously this is the better track in the whole album. A piano-laced softer and harmonious old-school soul track that sees Alicia puttin in her good vocal abilities. It goes up over the ranking. (11/10)<br />06.If I ain't got you. Well, this is a good soul and simple song. (7/10)<br />07.Diary (feat. Tony! Toni! Toné!). A good and heartfelt track with and hard and slow-mid tempo beat that keeps it up. (9/10)<br />08.Dragon days. Another good soul/hip-hop track, but it could be better. (7/10)<br />09.Wake up. Good song, R&B soft track with soft vocals. (9/10)<br />10.So simple. Good mid-uptempo R&B song. With that highpitched vocals on the chorus. That's OK. (9/10)<br />11.When you really love someone. This is a slow tempo track that keeps it really down. It's good. (6/10)<br />12.Feeling u, feeling me. This is an interlude, I can't really score it.<br />13.Slow down. Well, well, well, good track, maybe sad. (7/10)<br />14.Samsonite man. A shaking R&B track that keeps it really really good. (9/10)<br />15.Nobody not really. This song takes a jazz sound that makes it highly better than the other interlude, this almost isn't an interlude. (8/10)
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I won't write about every single song on this CD, but I can tell you that it's well worth the money. Alicia sings out her heart and soul! The tracks are tight and the vocals are even tighter. This is not some hoochie-mama, &quot;let me pretend I can sing because I have a body&quot; CD. Alicia Keys makes you feel every word she's singing. If you're into great music, lyrics and vocals, BUY THIS CD!
0385508417|4.0|John Grisham presents Skipping Christmas as a season of joy and much celebration, through an entirely different perspective. Skipping Christmas shows us just how insanely chaotic the holiday has become.<br />  Luther, a grumpy accountant, and Nora, his obliging wife, are the Kranks, a wealthy couple who have a beautiful daughter  named Blair off in Peru and a season of restlessness, headaches and mayhem fast approaching. So, Luther, who hates christmas comes up with an idea, to skip the holidays all together; to skip the crowded malls, hectic schedules and enormous bills, $6100, and take a cruise down to the Caribbean, Island Princess. However, there is only one problem, their neighbors. Being that the Kranks' house will be the only one on Hemlock Street without a Frosty on the roof, or even a Christmas tree, the neighbors are horrified and you will laugh out loud as the Kranks go through the pressures to conform and finally conclude in a tense, yet comical ending.<br />  This is not one of the funnniest story i ever read. Skipping Christmas is quick and fun and can be enjoyed by even teenagers like myself. It is a delightfully amusing book for those who understand the chaos and that have become a part of American holiday tradition.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well, after buying the cd, I really am impressed with Britney now rather than her previous cd's. She has grown up in a way. I love it because she grows slowly, not radically which is healthy.<BR>  I think that we should all give Britney a chance. I am not a fan of hers and yes she can't sing like Mariah Carey or hit the tones of Christina Aguilera but in fairness to her shes got the beat and she's doing everything from writing her own music to pushing the limits of sounds against all odds. In short she has what it takes to stay for long and for good.<BR>  The reason why a lot of people think that Britney sucks is that because they compare her with the likes of various artists which belt out high octaves and that is very unfair in her side. I think that we should stop comparing her just listen to her because thats the way she is you can't change everything. So what if you can't find yourself in the song that she sings? Its your problem! Plus I think its good sometimes to be out of ourselves don't you think?<BR> Atleast she tries her best. She gives all her shot and I believe its about time that we give her some credit not just searching for all the flaws that she has. <BR> In the end, Britney is Britney thats the main reason why she's here and we should not forget that. It's her mark. She's good at it. So why try to give insulting reviews when you can just appreciate her like other artists as well. Can you do what she does? I can't. That is why I appreciate her, her music, especially her dancing and her voice. She's got talent we just don't appreciate it coz we get to blinded with her image which over powers her plus we compare her with others which is sick!<BR> A true artist bends and shows all the sides that he isnt and I think Britney is a real one showing all the sides that she isn't. Like in the field of fashion like John Galiano wherein hes called &quot;the fashion terrorist&quot; but he's still an artist, Britney is also a terrorist in a good way  breaking allthe traditions and expectations especially in the field of music.
6305508550|5.0|Sometimes the most simple of words say more than a very long review could.  Think of this movie as you would if &quot;Clerks&quot; and &quot;Dilbert&quot; got together and had a baby.  This is one of my all time top ten favorite funny movies.  <br />Overall-Just plain funny, if you haven't already seen it please do so.
0452282152|4.0|I read this book in one day, which is saying a lot since I am a grad student in the middle of finals.  It is a quick read, written at a reading level middle schoolers could understand, but somehow manages to still be grown up.  Chevalier was very successful at evoking the Netherlands of the 17th century, I could picture myself surrounded by the canals and markets.  The characters in the book were also convincing, if rather flat at times.  This book is highly recommended to someone looking for a light and 100 percent enjoyable read, maybe on an airline flight.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I am a fan of DT. I bought all of their albums ,but  since a few days, i am have totally changed my mind about them. Sorry, but at my sense, &quot;train of thoughts&quot; is a really disapointing album. Probably the worst album they never made... During all the listening of the record, nothing takes off. Perhaps only the first song, &quot;as i am&quot; (John, stop listening to Black Sabbath!!) is good... but all of the other songs are really without any originality! the music is too loud every second the passes, the melodies are so poor!! Here we are, so far away from SFAM!! the lyrics has no sense &quot;train of thoughts&quot;, what does it mean??? And the solos!! Technical difficulties are not originality!! always the same! and Mike! What the hell are you doing there??? You are too good for the way the music of Dream Theater as taken!<BR>Your technic may be 'expoited' in a better way than in that kind of cafarnam! Join Neal, Roine and Pete! Your music could be sooo much better with them.<BR>But anyway, i already bought my tickets for your next concert in Brussels, so, see you there, guys!!!
B00005JM02|1.0|Finding Nemo was way too frightening for my two kids- 3 and 5.  Neither one of my kids are particularly skittish, but a mom and siblings eaten by sharks, a kidnapped kid and very scary sharks chasing the main characters was WAY too much for them.  I don't think they made it past 30 minutes into the movie.  I'm very sorry that I didn't preview it before allowing them to watch it.  The humor was funny to me, but definitely adult in nature, not focused on kids the way Toy Story or A Bug's Life is.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I have never written a review on Amazon... or anywhere else for that matter, but this film compelled me to do just that.<br />Whilst I can appreciate that it will not be everyone in the world's favourite film, I can, with my hand on my heart, say it is definitely mine. There was so much emotion involved, I came out a weak, pathetic excuse for a man!<br />The all-too-widely-banded about term 'Romantic Comedy' fits this film very well, but the term itself is too over-used with lesser deserved films to warrent labelling Love Actually with it too. Unfortunately, 'Romantic Comedy' is all too often a synonym for 'wishy-washy' and 'time-filling'.<br />This film is so much more. This film had me crying with laughter at the funny bits, crying with sadness when relationships weren't working out and crying with happiness with they did.<br />In 21 years of my life, I have never cried watching a film (give or take the odd Disney movie ;-)<br />This film, for me,was perfect. Something that angers me slightly is the number of people on this site critisizing the film for having too many plots and too many characters. Come on, if you're going to see a film like that, you should be an adult - everyone I went with had the brain capacity to watch it, completely understand it and thoroughly enjoy it for being an intelligent film. The number of plots was fantastically easy to understand (more so than a majority of films I've seen in the last few years) which is testament to the ability of Richard Curtis.<br />I also think that Americans are at a slight disadvantage when watching this film - there are so many hidden, inside, English jokes in this film it is unreal. Another reason is because so many of the actors on the film aren't really known to American people (unless they've watched The Office or Teachers etc.). English people between 19 to 35 would find this an incredibly funny, intelligent and heart-warming film - and a refreshing change to the habitual 'Romantic Comedies' out there.<br />Highlights for me where Martine McCucheon meeting Hugh Grant for the first time and swearing - by accident; the acting ability of the step-son; and the simple 'Ant or Dec' line, which literally had me on the floor laughing.<br />It makes you want to grab the person you're with when you leave the cinema - or better still - find the one you fancy, and tell them how much you like them. Because, after all, Christmas is a time for telling the truth...
B0000DD7LB|2.0|A few of the songs on here are a bit racey for younger kids, like &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; although she never admits to doing anything in the song it's pretty obvious what she's talking about although she says &quot;don't even need to touch me, Breathe On Me&quot; please! Oh and Anyone who listened to the 90's song &quot;Legend of A Cowgirl&quot; By Imana Coppola will recognize the verse rip off on &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;. I actually like the techno song &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; and the Madonna release is great.
0345452577|5.0|I also did not know I'd be missing Dr. Delaware in this book.  I was quite happy to embrace a new protagonist.  Jeremy is so very human in all his feelings and responses.  I enjoyed seeing him become interested in Dr. Chess despite his earlier standoffishness.  I think that it is a mistake to expect an author to continue churning out books all using the same protagonist.  I like the fact that Mr. Kellerman has chosen someone new, whether we see him again or not!
B00005AR3G|5.0|Yeah, I know it's a Disney film.  But if the screen credits didn't say so, I'd swear it came from Warner.  It has that great anarchic Warner-style humor that makes Bugs, Daffy, Wile E. and the gang so much fun to watch.  I don't know why this movie wasn't a bigger success in the theaters, but it's a real treat.  Stylish animation, great dialog and voice work ...  a welcome change from the treacly pap that Disney usually churns out.  Five stars all the way!
B0000DJZA0|3.0|I loved both &quot;Parachute&quot; and &quot;Rush of Blood...&quot; and they've seen some heavy rotation in my CD player for the longest time.  Nonetheless, I've never had a chance to catch the band at a concert and I thought that this would be a great way to make up for the lost opportunities.  It was not.<br />To me, the strength of their music is in the tight composition of the songs and achieving the right balance between emotion and virtuosity -- the topics in their songs are always pretty sober, but the reason why they sound beautiful instead of dragging and depressing is because of this.  In live, however, this balance is totally thrown off and the songs do not sound as 'put together' as they do on the albums.  <br />In my opinion, music from bands such as Dave Mathews Band are inducive to improvisations and live concerts; music from Coldplay, however, is not.  Fans will still appreciate this album, but I would not recommend this.
B0000025RI|5.0|I've known Michael Jackson for a long time. Thriller is my fav.. My Fav. song is \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller\\". I now have all his albums. I am a Michael Jackson freak. And I just bought his new \\"Number Ones\\". Michael Jackson is very talented. I hope he has another new album. I'll buy it! This album is the greatist album of all time. All of these songs are still fresh. Each song can get stuck to you. \\"Billie Jean\\" Is the greatest song of all time. Get this album. You won't be sorry.
B00000099Y|5.0|Excellent CD ... thought-full lyrics, great music, amazing voice ...
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I was waiting for a more mature Britney. This woman can't singer and is a good match for the bad singer Madonna. Britney take some music lessons. This CD is bad!!!!
B00005JM4Z|5.0|What can I say? Well, I can say alot, but I'll try to sum up my excitement in less than 1,000 words, which is nearly impossible! Paul Walker has done it again in this action-packed fun-filled sequel which takes you on a wild ride through the streets of Miami in some of the fastest and coolest looking cars ever created! The woman in the movie (Eva Mendes), is possibly one of the hottest creatures ever created by God! Any fan of the first movie will enjoy this one as well. Even though Vin Diesel couldn't make it, the movie still gets by without him. Tyrese delivers and awesome performance as Roman Pierce; the destruction derby bad boy from Barstow! This movie can do no wrong!
B000002KOQ|5.0|I first heard this album when I bought a tape deck (reel-to-reel) from my brother in the early 70's when I was in my early teens. A recording of this was included.  I knew who it was, but didn't know the name of the album for a long time as the box was unlabelled.  I remember being struck with how clean it was, and enjoyed the standards on it (Circle Game, For Free, Big Yellow Taxi), but didnt' think too much about it.  I rediscovered the album as a heartbroken 21 year old, and was stunned at the words that Joni had penned.  They spoke to me so directly and with such insight, she'd been where I was.<br />This album comes in and out of my life, much like some people do, close friends who you may only connect with now and then, the time with them is so intense, you almost can't do it on a regular basis, but they are so valuble to you.  This and most of Ms. Mitchell's other mid-period work are like that with me, when I'm in a time loss or reflection, they come out.<br />Anyway, can't add too much musically to the already written reviews, except that I hope people really listen to the words (and read them to get them all) because she is saying some amazing things here.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's disheartening when one of the best shows ever to hit the small screen suddenly gets cancelled. But that's Fox for ya. How many series have they cancelled now? Far too many.<br />From the day it started I was hooked on this series. I've always like sci-fi but never considered that a space western was even possible. Joss Whedon totally pulls it off. As the summary mentions, It's about a group of rag-tag off in space and around the Outer planet all aboard this one ship, Serenity. Each character is there for a different reason, and each one has a story to trheir character that goes way beyond what was show before the show was cancelled.<br />In terms of plot and character developement, it is the best I've seen in a TV show in quite a while. Most character you see out there are flakes with not much substance to them, but with all of the characters in Firefly, you can tell that there are things that they are just not sharing. Especially Shepard Book. How is it possible that a preacher knows so much and work his way around the Alliance? Besides what was revealed in Ariel, what really happened to River? Such questions will never be answered, unless the movie Joss is working on makes it to the big screen<br />So, for those who have no idea what Firefly is, check it out. And if you do know, then there's no sense in saying it, you'd be buying the DVDs.
B00007L4MJ|3.0|Metropolis is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Furthermore is one of my favorite stories of all time.<br />I was quite exited to see a Restored &quot;Authorized&quot; Edition, but when I saw it I was very dissapointed.<br />The restauration in this one is one of the most uncaring and unloving  works I have seen.  They did not care if the story in the movie was told smoothly or not, they just said &quot;hey we found this footage... lets stick it in!!&quot;, and they did.<br />Some of the the chunks they put in made the story relly on the written letters and less in the image, and some others were just not calibrated at the right speed  (but oh, yeah, we managed to restore this &quot;lost marvels&quot;... right).<br />People  in charge of restaurations, please: before gluing the pieces together, first learn to love the film you are working , wonder if the restauration you are making adds some merit to the film or it is just candy for the depraved  film experts out there... Movies are not meant to be classes of history (although they are) they are supposed to be tales told with lights and shadows and wonder... Do not spoil them with bits and pices that spoil or might spoil the fun.
B000002H33|5.0|Every rock band should be envious of this creation. It is undoubtedly one of the best albums not only of heavy metal but of all of rock.  The first track &quot;Battery&quot; beats us into submission before we get to hear one of Metallica's best, &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot;  Though clocking in at 8:38, it does not have a boring moment in it.  Tied with the title track for the best on the album are &quot;Sanitarium&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Orion&quot;.  &quot;Sanitarium&quot; is a great song that starts of slow but ends with some intense riffing, and the song's tempo, dynamics, and lyrics definitely conjure up the image of an insane guy that's losing it.  &quot;Orion&quot; in my opinion is their best instrumental on any album.  It's the one track on the album I can listen to over and over again in one sitting.  Although I consider &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Sanitarium&quot;, and &quot;Orion&quot; to be the best tracks, 4 of the remaining 8 tracks are also outstanding (I think Damage, Inc. is too thrashy for this album). This album, in my opinion, is the pinnacle of Metallica's work. Although several of their albums come close to this achievement, they still don't quite reach the level of this album again.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|When I heard 'Me Against the Music', i honestly thought that Britney would produce a more mature record, and by that, i mean, i record that was well thought-of, and has many different sounds. It's true, that Britney cannot sing but still, she has the charisma to carry of different styles of music. It was a pain for me to listen to the album from start to finish. I hated to admit that i regretted buying this album. if i had known better, i would have just downloaded the songs on the internet!!<br />Still, as i WAS a fan, i gave Britney a second chance. I listenned to the WHOLE ALBUM two more times,hoping that i would grew to enjoy the tracks, but NO, i still say, it SUCKS!<BR>I personally think that Britney was impatient to get back to  being THE Pop Princess. So, she didn't really choose her material wisely. Most of the songs sound alike and let me just get this off my chest : THE LYRICS SUCK! A ten-year-old could've come up with better lyrics! Is this what you call MATURE? I think not. <br />There are only two songs that i enjoy listenning to over and over again : Me Against the Music and Boom Boom. I was dissapointed. Big Time. I don't think i can give Britney another chance i she comes up with a brand-new album. I guess Hilary will take the throne now, don't ya think?
B000003TAB|5.0|I actually recieved this cd as a birthday gift in 1995. I had never been into Nirvana, and really only knew them for their singles. It took me a while to warm up to \\"Incesticide\\" but after a few listens I was totally hooked. Released after their big album \\"Nevermind\\", \\"Incesticide\\" is an album that returns to the roots of Nirvana. It features b-sides and older Nirvana songs made long before \\"Nevermind\\". In some ways this album is better than Nevermind, it isn't as glossy or polished. Standout tracks are \\"Dive\\", \\"Sliver\\", \\"Stain\\", \\"Been A Son\\", \\"Aero Zeppelin\\" and a harder version of \\"Polly\\" as well as the classic - \\"Aneurysm\\". They also do a great cover of the Vaselines' \\"Molly's Lips\\" and \\"Son of a Gun\\" - not to mention a cover of Devo's \\"Turnaround\\". I also love the bouncy bass on \\"Hairspray Queen\\". And I have to mention Kurt makes psychotic sounding ramblings fun - in songs like \\"Beeswax\\" and \\"Mexican Seafood\\" - I think he's the only man that could pull it off and make it simply rock. Either way, this album is great. Its like Nirvana in the raw, as many of these songs were recorded before Nirvana exploded into the mainstream. Just a great b-sides album with just as great previously unreleased stuff. And if you do one thing, read Kurt's liner notes on the album- they're pretty interesting.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Seek it out.  Buy it.  Not for the squeamish.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|My dad bought this cd for my mother who loves Phil Collins, I picked it out for her birthday,he just bought it. I'm a little familiar with his hits so I started listening to it on my own time,and just loved the cd.My sister and brothers liked it alot too!We all including my mother listened to it so much,it got all scratched up!lol:)All the songs are good on this album.I recommend anybody to get this album if there a Phil Collin's fan,or just want to listen to good,relaxing music.
B0000648WZ|5.0|There is so much going on in this film.  One viewing will not be enough.  This is my absolute favorite science fiction film ever made with Aliens coming in at a close second.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|5 time grammy award winner, Alicia Keys (A.Keys), has done it again with the Diary of Alicia Keys. She has put out a nearly flawless album that, in my opinion, is just as great as her debut album Songs in A minor. With 15 songs on this album Alicia Keys has proved that she isn't going to be placed in the 'sophmore jinx' album. Some of the songs on this album have that 70's soul/funk thang going on....its Hot!!! I give Alicia full props on this CD...she produced a lot of the songs on this album except for a couple 'Heartburn'(Timberland) and 'You Don't Know My Name'(Kayne West). Her talent shines on this album because her piano skills are more evident and the songs are based around the piano. Ya'll should not be without this album in your collectio. If you were diggin' her first CD and you like &quot;you don't Know My Name' than you need to get off the computer and go to wherever u go to get CDs and get this one. ALso make sure ya'll check her out when she goes on tour. Her concert is amazing( I saw her twice last year).
0553212443|5.0|The one question I continually asked myself while reading this was 'why didn't I read this any sooner?!?!'. I won't go into the plot, because I'm sure everybody knows the concept of this book. I've seen so many television and movie versions of A Christmas Carol, that I decided to sit down and read the original, and I'm sure glad I did. Not only does this book have a great lesson to it, but it is also beautifully written. I think everyone should read this book - and not just at Christmas time. Sure, the story takes place at Christmas, but it's a great book to read any time.  I highly recommend it!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|With no standout  singles like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" or \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" and altogether fewer listenable tracks than \\"Britney,\\" \\"In the Zone\\" still manages to stand out as Ms. Spears best album.  Instead of peeking at you from behind her petticoats, Britney finally pushes you up against a wall and whispers \\"sex\\" in your ear on this album.  <br />\\"Me Against the Music\\" may be slightly disappointing, but remains a solid single while \\"Boom Boom\\" and \\"Outrageous\\" provide decent but forced forays into hip-hop, undoubtedly at her label's insistence.  \\"Shadow\\" is a wonderful thief of Avril's \\"I'm WIth You,\\" and \\"Brave New Girl\\" is an homage to the Spice Girls that manages to candy coat sexual naivete.  There are three stand-out tracks:  \\"Toxic,\\" a fantastic Baliwood dance tune crafted by the pop-trusty Swedes; \\"Breathe On Me,\\" which drips sexiness and uses Brit's breathily fragile voice to a degree Kylie never could; and, of course, \\"Everytime,\\" her mature and painfully haunting ballad that classily trumps Justin's \\"Cry Me A River.\\"  <br />After all the hooplah, \\"In the Zone\\" manages to make the listener crave her next album, if only to hear a complete transition away from mainstream of \\"hip-pop\\" and into the artistry hinted at in \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Everytime.\\"
0385504209|4.0|Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist and Sophie Neveu, a  french cryptologist, work together to solve a mystery:  The curator of the Louvre was murdered, Langdon is being accused of the murder, and Neveu works with him to get him out of trouble.  Of course they first have to get out of the museum, only to be led back to the Mona Lisa, inside of the museum.  The cryptic message left by the curator has its' first clue with the painting, and that one message in the Mona Lisa painted an entire novel of  trying to solve the curator's message.<br />The message of course is politically and religious oriented:  The Priory of Sion and the Opus Dei are two organizations - the former was a secret society that historical figures belonged to; the latter was a devout catholic sect of the Vatican. Each clue confounds Langdon and Neveu:  Was the curator a part of one of these groups?  What was he afraid of, who was after him, and what was he trying to tell them?  Most important, did they have to preserve an ancient historical secret ... and how were they going to do it?<br />The two go from the museum, all over France, to England and back to France - all in 24 hours mind you - as one mystery brings upon yet another...<br />This is a page turner until the very end, the surprises are endless and the solution to the code may just be as mysterious as the message itself.  Some codes are never meant to be broken.
0553213105|4.0|The novel Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen merits praise even with the high expectations I contained for it. In the first few paragraphs, I was confronted with flighty gossip and lacy trifles that were rather discouraging considering that I had expected something more profound. Yet as the novel progressed, the flowery language had a zing to it that amuses a person as it pokes fun at those with immense wealth in nineteenth century English society and at the traditions that were upheld. The Bennett family holds the attention of the readers in this novel, especially the women, as they deal with society's regulations regarding entailment. The fact that a male heir does not exist in the Bennett family causes Mrs. Bennett to become anxious to marry her five daughters off to men with fortunes. The aspect of the novel that truly provides the reader with contentment resides in the moral development of two of the main characters. The character flaws that exist within Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are discovered, examined, and steadily coached until both can live more fully. I appreciate this fine piece of literature for the magnificent writing syle that Austen utilized and the clever character development that she employed.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Yeah, right. I can't believe some people think Slipknot is the heaviest band on the planet. There are heavier bands out there that are being ignored and spat upon because people are listening to Slipknot and making them believe it's the only metal band that exists. All Slipknot is doing is making their fans think they're hardcore while the people that are into real metal are laughing at them. Even bands from the 80s make Slipknot look like whiny little wimps(80s metal is better than nu-metal!). Note to people who listen to rap: just because someone listens to heavy metal, it does not mean that person listens to Slipknot. Slipknot is a disgrace to heavy metal. Fans will be reading this and calling me names and all that crap, but that's not going to do a thing. That will just make me hate Slipknot even more. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to listen to real metal.
B0000DD7NL|2.0|IF YOU LIKE THE LAST ALBUM, CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL LIKE THIS TOO. IF YOU ARE INTO BORING PREDICTABLE ARTIST CREATED BY THE MEDIA FOR YOUNG ADULTS TO ADORE AS NEW AND FOR THE OLDER GENERATION ACCEPT AS TALENTED RATHER THAN REALIZING THAT THIS FALSE REPRESENTATION AS A NEW MUSIC HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE AND DONE BEFORE AND DONE BEFORE, EXCUSE ME I AM REPEATING MYSELF JUST AS THIS ALBUM REPEATEDLY USES SOUL SAMPLES FROM THE SEVENTIES. DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS IS A TALENTED ARTIST, TOO BAD THEY DON'T LET IT BE KNOWN THROUGH HER REMAKES AND HER SLIGHT PIANO MELODIES AND RIFFS THAT SHE PLAYS OVER SAMPLE AFTER SAMPLE. THIS WHOLE HIP-HOP R&amp;B THING SUCKS. HIP IS DYING FAST WITHOUT THESE SO CALLED &quot; ARTIST &quot; HELPING OUT.
B000000JO3|5.0|i decided to write this review in response to the unfair review given by the angry parent. The album was called &quot;vulgar and disgusting,&quot; which is outrageous, because Minor Threat is one of the more positive bands (Dayglo Abortions anyone? XD) i have heard. I know of a handful of bands that are straightedge (anti-flag, etc) anymore, she should be glad there are bands her son is interested in that don't use drugs. The repeated use of the &quot;f word,&quot; is at the discretion of the artists, and buying an album because it has a &quot;clever title,&quot; is ridiculous (especially seeing as the title is 'Complete Discography'). Parents, read the lyrics before you buy it. Punks, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This album is AMAZING, POSITIVE, FAST, FUN!and FUN! My favorite track is &quot;In My Eyes,&quot; not sure why...it just rocks. \m/ rock on, keep music free.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|After hearing Howard Shore's stunning conclusion to Perter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, I can only state one thing: Excellent. Excellent doesn't really do justice to the magnificence of Shore's work. Like another classic trilogy score (Williams from Return of the Jedi), Shore presents a much more mature version of work. All our favorite themes are there: The Fellowship theme has now evolved into a wistful yet powerful fanfare for Aragorn. The Shire theme makes a return as does the Hobbit theme, both played magnificently by James Galway. Also returning is the Mordor theme, it's menacing notes now grown into a malevolent force. The Rohan theme also makes a brief reappearance, while the elvish theme comes to a full circle, representing Aragorn as he gets his sword in the track Andruil. The beginning of the cd is much more playful than that of the Two Towers, but it swiftly transforms into a majestic fanfare for Minas Tirith and Gondor which is among the greatest moments on the cd.  Once again Enya does not sing on this cd, but in a suprisingly powerful decision, Billy Boyd aka Pippin does appear, singing briefly for Lord Denethor, capturing the rift between the Steward and Faramir. In track 17, The Return of the King, Shore takes a listener on a journey of all his developed themes for our heroes. Absent from this cd is Sauruman's theme, the reason being because he is defeated in the Two Towers. Also absent is the treeish theme for the Ents and Treebeard, but the absence of these themes is not at all detrimental to the cd. As for the song at the end by Annie Lennox, it is a vast improvement over Gollum's song, but Enya's May It Be from the Fellowship soundtrack is still the best of the three.  Of the limited edition sets, The Two Towers was the only to furnish an extra track from the extended editions.  Unfortunately, this only has a bonus dvd.  Anyway overall great score, great trilogy, great composer.
B000002H8F|5.0|I have played this album literally hundreds of times from start to finish.  A modern day masterpiece from the band that created alternative music.  This band is truly blessed.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary is an excellent potrayal of fantasies and desires and fetishes one can't speak in words. Maggie Glynnenhall does an excellent job as the shy and mildly confused Lee who is taken in as a Secretary. Simple conversations turn into deep truth games, where dark secrets are spilled between Lee and the boss. He helps her cope with an obsession with injection and cutting herself. Soon, this turns into even more when the boss' obsession with  typos turns into a kinky world of spanks, chains, and moist succulent fun. Secretary bring what other movies revolving around this subject cannot; charm, wit, and beautiful grotesque scenes between the boss and Lee. Lee's life to the viewer is alost pathetic, who lives with her parents and dates a poor man. All this is fulfilled by her desires to spell wrong on her typings and this movie thickens the border for the crazy world of kinky fetishes. Excellent movie..but not for the uneasy viewer..
B000099T2L|5.0|I'm not really a Beyonce fan, but i like this CD alot. I like when R&amp;B artists do a lot of slow songs. Good job.

B000068FWC|3.0|I've had &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; in my head for three days.  Why?  They don't play Supertramp on the radio (at least no station I'd listen to), they're safely forgotten, I haven't actually heard this song in at least 10 years, but they haunt me, haunt me.  Get out of my head!  Leave me alone with your peppy pop melodies and English perkiness.  GOOOOO AWAAAAAY!
B0000DD7NL|3.0|Alicia Keys knows soul. With that there is no doubt. She knows how to conjure up deep emotions and evoke great feeling in both lyric and music. But this one question haunts me: &quot;Where is that on this record?!&quot; Make no mistake, Alicia is extremely talented. Her piano playing and writing are usually of the first rate. But it's when she tries to blend her classical influences with neo soul on this record that she fails.<br />&quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;- Grammy worthy. It made me excited to purchase the album. One fo the few true gems on the album, and does it ever shine. &quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot; is another tack on which the artist truly does shine. Gladys Knight would be proud! Wake up and So Simple are also tracks on which her craft is truly revealed. Yet the great songs are few and far between unlike it's beautifully crafted predecessor. One more word: rushed? -DLC
0763621579|5.0|We started reading to our daughter very young, which she always enjoyed, but this was the first book we read where she clearly followed the narrative.  She was in visible suspense when the mother owl was gone and very relieved when she came back.  An amazing moment!  It was a favorite that we read many times thereafter.  She was around 2 years old at the time and I highly recommend this book as a gift for a child that age.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I don't understand what everyone has a problem with. So she grew up? big deal, that's usually what people do. Her sound has grown up with her, she's abandoned the bubble gum pop that go her known and she is exploring other aspects of the music industry. I have purchased all of her cds and her previous efforts were shallow, and worked their way out of my cd player in a matter of days. This one however has found a spot there and plans to stay there. It is grown up, and the lyrics match the vibe, sensual and sophisticated. People need to layoff, just because she isn't doing the same thing over and over doesn't mean she is a glorified dancer. Which she does move very well...but you get my point.
0345452577|2.0|When I saw Kellerman had a new book coming out, I signed up for it at the library without knowing what it was about, just assuming it was another Alex Deleware book.  When I picked it up, I was disappointed that it wasn't, but still optimistic, since I love Kellerman's books.  This book is a disappointment. I was well over 100 pages in, and still was not &quot;into&quot; the story.  The main character, Jeremy, did not draw me in like Alex did in the other books.  I didn't feel a connection with Jeremy, and didn't find myself rooting for him, like I do for Alex and Milo.  The story is very slow moving, no driving suspense like the Deleware books.  I finished the book because I was &quot;curious&quot; about how it would end, not because I had a driving need like I do with really good mysteries.  I hope Kellerman sticks with the Deleware series, it's a much better read in my opinion.

B0000C6E4D|2.0|So after what, 6 years of waiting you get really excited when an artist you love comes out with a new alblum. Well I had heard it was &quot;nothing new&quot; and &quot;the same old Sarah&quot; but to me its not, its nothing near as good as weve heard before. One song sounds like the next and the next. Nothing stands out and its all a blur of a cd. <BR>I wish I could love it since I loved her last cd so much and it has been such a long time but I just cant. <BR>Youll end up buying it anyway if your a Sarah fan and come to your own conclusion but dont get to excited.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has cut DVD that is up on top of the list. It is one that ya'll can live it up to. You want to get down and jam or you want to hold your loved one close or the one you want to love close. This DVD has it all for those who want to live it up or just slow it down. Shania Up Live in Chicago is a dancers and lovers DVD.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Isnt anyone else just sick and tired of her yet? She cant sing, no really SHE CANT SING!!!! All she can successfully do is shake her a$$ but even that is getting old.<BR>Im so tired of all this Britney hype and how anybody can spend money on her cd's is just beyond me. <BR>She reminds me of Paula Abdul, not a good voice, a few catchy tunes and creative videos. But now can I listen to those cd's? Heck no, her voice sounds like Betty Boop. As does Britneys. Im so tired of non talented little girls flaunting around like hookers getting paid to shake their a##. <BR>Please wake up people and stop buying her stuff, lets just let her career die.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a great DVD, perfect for any Shania fan. But even if you're not a fan, you'll become one after watching it. The DVD has hit songs from Shania's previous CD's and from her latest one, UP! Get this DVD, you won't regret it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to say that I have never really been a big fan of Britney Spears. I bought her first c.d. and after listening to it and realizing it was not good at all, I didn't buy any other of her c.d.'s since. However, one of my friends bought this new Brtiney c.d., &quot;In The Zone&quot; and while we were hanging out one night she put the c.d. on for me to listen to. Let me just say, I was shocked! This c.d. is actually very good. It is probably the best Britney Spears c.d. so far. All of the songs make me want to dance, so it would be a great c.d. for a party as well. Do yourself a favor and check this album out- even if, like me, you haven;t really liked Britney's c.d.'s in the past. I'm sure you will be happily surprised at how good it is. My favorite songs are &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Me Against The Music.&quot; Trust me though, I now own this c.d. and almost all of the songs are awesome!
B0000TB03W|5.0|SHANIA'S UP ( Live in Chicago ) DVD is a MUST-HAVE for any SHANIA fan, let alone, your DVD collection! You can't beat SHANIA'S great music and UP-beat energy you get from watching this DVD!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has outdone herself this album.  All the songs are really great to sing along to and the collaborations couldn't be better.  It's an uplifting cd to listen to and I'm glad she took all that time off to work on this cd.  You will not be sorry if you buy this cd.. but if you are... I didn't say a thing!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Earlier in the year, she made a strong comeback with her CD Up! Shania Twain proved to her fans that she is still the top woman in country. This DVD is a must have for all fans. Shania is a great peformer - she brings energy and excitement to her fans and her live singing is among the best. Her songs and well crafted and her performances will have you wanting to see more of Shania
B00003CWTI|1.0|When you see the casting, you just expect a great movie and I guess the acting is the only thing positive in it.When the movie starts in a really cool and interesting way and when you know that you have 3 hours movie to watch, you just think &quot;What a great moment I am ready to enjoy&quot;. The problem is that everything is turning out and you finally get bored after half an hour.The story is about .... Love, Pride, Hope ... and it's completely flat, flat, flat ! It just happens nothing except a frog rain at the end that also means nothing ! It's for sure one of the most boring movies of my life. The one star rate is really for the actors only ! The rest is garbage !
B00003003R|5.0|If you love Guns N Roses you will love this album. All of their best songs played live. It's particularly great if you're like me and never got to see them perform. I have owned this album for about 4 years and some of the songs still give me chills. For example, listening to the crowd singing along during Knockin' On Heaven's Door or Axl Rose's special piano intro that leads into November Rain. I definitely recommend adding this to your Guns N Roses collection.
B00004TJTS|1.0|This movie mad me cry so much it made me mad. If you are a really big dog lover, this is not the movie for you.<BR>Sure, at first it is promising with the cute dog messing around, but then it gets depressing. <BR>No fun at all in this movie.
B000000OSE|5.0|Even though I personally like all of Guns N Roses CDs and could never pick a favorite, this is a really good CD. Many people feel the song selection for UYI1 is very random. To me, it still keeps to the style of music used on Appetite for Dustruction, but at the same time gives you songs like November Rain to start easing you into the more mellow Use Your Illusion II. Depending on which side of GnR you like (the hard or the mellow) just depends on which UYI album you will enjoy. However, you really can't do one without the other.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Do not waste your time or money.  The only reason I continued to watch this movie is because I bought it.  I will not even try to pawn it off on someone else just out of pity for them.  Bad writing and acting; a waste of my time and money.
B000089RVR|3.0|Not bad, but not as good as her last release.  I love Dido, but this disc does not have the same intensity and modern edged feel in my opinion.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|this is the best album ever! it have a clasic vibe and a new flavor all in one its so orriginal yet makes you feel the classic rock and roll of the beatles and other bands of the era. we have alot of rock goups right now but these guys roll it too! this album is great and all the songs surpassed my expectations, which were already high. get it and you wont regret it!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This disc is so lame.  And downright cheesy.  Britney's nasal vocal delivery and Madonna's singing &quot;Hey Britney&quot; is so bad it is almost funny, only I don't think either &quot;performer&quot; (notice I don't say &quot;musician&quot;) has enough of a sense of humor to find themselves as laughable as they truly are.  At least both &quot;performers&quot; have taken enough direction from their recording companies to have hired decent studio musicians, which they desperately need to back their extremely limited vocal abilities.  One would think that the general public would have wised up by now and have realized that Britney Spears (and Madonna) have no real talent, but no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American pubic, which appears to have gone deaf, especially in regard to the public's perception of what makes good music today.  I can only hope that eventually all the Britney's, Madonna's and J-Lo's will step down  from their unworthy public perception pedestals and make way for  performers deserving of admiration for their musical ability, since, after all, they are selling &quot;music&quot;, right?
0156027321|4.0|When I first saw this title advertised by the books page in Amazon I wondered how Pi - the Greek letter for number 3.14 - would be used in that novel. I had to buy this book to find out. What motivated me to buy it was the fact that I soon found out the book was translated in Greek, among tens of other languages. When I read it I thought 'this could make a great film' and I waited it would happen soon. Now I heared at movies.go.com that the film is to be releashed on 2004. By the time writting this I am in page 180 and so far the plot is okay.
B000002H70|5.0|That is really all I have to say about this album - Play Very Loud, and enjoy.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I want to address some people's criticism that the new Terminator was initially a liquid metal, and then became an endoskeleton machine.  You may remember from T2 that Robert Patrick could form knives, axes, etc.  Arnold explains to John Conner that the terminator of T2 can not form chemicals, moving parts.  <br />Ms. Lokken's Terminator had weapons built into her hands, and that required an endoskeleton.  So she was a hybrid of Arnold's type, and Robert Patrick's type.  An endoskeleton with a liquid metal skin.
B000002KO3|5.0|Hands down, this is the best T-Heads album ever made.  The most psychedlic, the most rhythmic, the tightest production, and the most musically sophisticated album they ever put out. When someone tells me they &quot;never liked the Talking Heads&quot;, &quot;David Byrne is too 'whiney'&quot;, or that &quot;the T-Heads are a band for girls&quot; (which I still don't get, Rick Karr from NPR), I slip this disc into the rotation, and, believe me, someone is choking on their words. I'd give it ten stars if possible, but I guess that was not an option.
B00008G9JM|5.0|I was at first reluctant to buy this album knowing that APP divided fans in the past; you either love it or hate it. I finally decided to get this and I'm glad to say that I love it. The concept of life after death and the choices that are made by the main character, Ronnie Pilgrim, is very original. The lyrics are more obscure than Thick As A Brick's but that's what I love about it as well as the complex music that goes perfectly with them. Even The Hare is entertaining though I know some people don't care for it. The Hare is to provide some comedy amongst the dark material like traditional passion plays from the medieval times did. If you're into complex compositions, abstract lyrics and something original then GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!
0385504209|2.0|If you think you've read this book before, you have.  Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; covers much the same ground, is better written, and more sound in its research.<br />The author can't even take the step of having his Parisian characters create puzzles in French (and his own French seems at times in need of assistance).<br />Worst is his annoying habit of ending chapters as the characters view some shocking item - not to be revealed for pages to come.  By mid book, you are juggling so many of these, it's not surprising if you forget a few by the time they are in fact revealed!<br />It is amusing that he takes a legitimate religious organization, Opus Dei, and turns into a cartoon of a James Bond evil spy ring.  One only hopes that too many don't look in this pious group for shadowy albino assassins.  I dare say they won't find any.<br />And by the way, cell phones don't work in airplanes.  You are thousands of feet from the nearest antenna which is pointed down (you know, towards where the cell phones are for the most part!)
B00000JPHG|3.0|this couldve been better if chucky was still chasing after Andy. But because of the kills and humor i give it a 3
0553382179|5.0|To the reviewer who &quot;felt&quot; much of the information presented was taken from Pam and Peggy's SHE system, that's because it is, and this is not a revelation to anyone who has visited the flylady web site. <br />I think the book is fun, inspiring and touching. Marla Cilley is not an author primarily, so I wasn't surprised or disappointed when her style was not Pulitzer prize winning material. Still, it was excellent! Some readers may simply prefer having her system in book form.
B0000TWMMU|5.0|WHAT A GREAT IDEA TO RE_RELEASE THIS ALBUM! this album is the soundtrack of the 80's and i cannot wait to hear it again! dirty dancing was certainly the best movie of the 80's which puts it up for best all time!
B00005Q4CS|2.0|This movie is 5 stars in terms of cinematic devices; the final sequence rivals anything Sergei Eisenstein could offer.  But in terms of story it is nothing; any sensible person knows the message already: DON'T DO DRUGS.  I don't need an incredibly hopeless and depressing film to tell me that, and after seeing it you are no better off than before.  Not worth owning because it would be incredibly difficult to sit through more than once.  If there is a message beyond the drug one, it seems to be that life has no meaning and it is all hopeless.  Not a pleasant film at all, and hardly the incredible breakthrough that so many make it out to be.<BR>Perhaps worth watching once to see a graphic depiction of how drugs can destroy your life.  The people involved are likeable (at times), so your sympathy for them does manifest.  However, I'm not sure I would call this \\"art\\" as so many reviewers here do.  In terms of films, I would say \\"art\\" is something subtle that you gain something from with each successive study.  There is no way to call this film subtle and repeated viewings would induce suicide.  This is the kind of movie you either love or hate, and I in the latter position, sorry folks.
B00006F2TV|2.0|I can't stand this movie. Why? Let me count the ways. (1) First and foremost, Peter Parker's love for Mary Jane comes up WAY too many times. He tells us at the beginning that he loves her. Then he says it again. Then he shows it in his actions. Then Aunt May mentions it. Then Harry Osborn mentions it. Okay, okay. We GET it. One time would have been enough. (2) Why cover up Willem Dafoe's face? Once he has the mask on, it could be anyone under there. And he has a good face for the Green Goblin. (3) The special effects are bad half the time. Yes, that's a CGI Spiderman beating up bad guys in the alley. It's obvious. (4) Macy Gray? Why? (5) Mary Jane's protuberances in the rain are, let's say, out of place. But they ARE memorable.<br />There are a few good things. It's not all bad. (1) The casting is good. Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker. Even Aunt May is well-cast. (2) Randy Macho-Man Savage makes a cameo. Right on! (3) The organic webshooters are a good idea, so is the sequence in which Peter Parker explores his new powers. (4) Finally, the plot sort of made sense, which is rare for superhero movies. This is a solid two-star movie. I didn't want my money back, but I never want to see it again. Hopefully the sequel will have better effects and less love story repetition.
B00005JM02|5.0|If you liked 'Toy Story', 'A Bugs Life' and 'Monsters Inc' then you'll like this movie. It's by the same people, with the same care and detail.<BR>The kids will love it because it's got charming characters who embark on a great underwater adventure full of thrills, spills and laughter. <BR>Adults will love it for the same reason but also because, in true Pixar (the creators) style, the story is wonderfully scripted and interlaced with little subtleties and references that keep the story fresh time after time.<BR>So when your son or daughter wants to watch it for the 14th time this week it's still watchable.<BR>Get this movie, and if you've not done so yet, get everything else Pixar have had a hand in creating.<BR>You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Sorry to say but after watching this movie. The longer the movie went on the more my eyes wanted to shut.
0446530891|2.0|Well, I couldn't put the book down.  Picked it up on a Saturday and finished in on a Monday.  The problem was that I was pissed at myself and even more pissed at Baldacci that I wasted two days reading this tripe.  Most of the reviewers on this site are either on narcotics or on Baldacci's payroll.  What could have been an amazing book, beginning to end, turned into one of the great clunkers of all time.  This book has about the most insultingly inane ending of any suspense/thriller I've ever read.  I'll have to think twice before I read a Baldacci novel again.
B00008A7QK|5.0|If you're looking for the best albums from each genre this is definitely the glam-rock representant(in the same footing with Bowie's &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;)and one of the best 70's albums.<br />Marc Bolan's simple but thrilling guitar playing added to a voice that set the tone for legions of imitators really did make wonders.<br />Every track has some standout feature,still &quot;Motivator&quot;,&quot;Rip Off&quot;,&quot;Get it On&quot;,&quot;Mambo Sun&quot;,&quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot;and &quot;Monolith&quot;are nigh on perfect pop gems that have stood the test of time unflaggingly.<br />This really is one of the key albums in rock history and T-Rex's finest hour.
B000069AUI|3.0|Not a bad album, per se, but certainly not the epic album of the year. While Coldplay have some songistry talent, these tracks -- with the exception of \\"God Put a Smile on Your Face\\", \\"Clocks\\" and \\"A Whisper\\" -- are largely forgettable. And frankly, Chris Martin's over-yearning vocals grate on one's nerves after while. In fact, it was precisely because of \\"Yellow\\" off their debut album that I vowed never to give them a second listen. <br /> <br />But as circumstance would have it, I came into my possession a copy of A Rush of Blood to the Head, and while I've heard much worse albums, I'm glad I didn't pay for it.
B00000JCOV|1.0|...and that's only one. Cannibal Corpse are the only band I can think of that suck more than SlipKnot do. I have heard a lot of reviews saying that this isn't proper metal. But they're wrong. Forget not being metal music, this can't even be classified as music, period. <BR>    All it is is nine talentless neanderthals (I'd just like to point out that no band that size could ever produce something worth listening to), bashing out random beats on drums, doing that thing you used to do when you were a kid on the guitar (you know, strumming the strings up and down, thinking it sounds like music), and one of them seems to be in the middle of a particularly painful hearnia. Or maybe he's a deluded fathead who thinks he's singing? Just like the guitarists. <BR>    They're not as bad as Cannibal Corpse, but that is very, very faint praise in deed. If you want proper metal, go for any of the following:<br />Murderdolls*, Metallica, KoRn, Nine Inch Nails  <br />(*see, if only Slipknots drummer played the guitar when playing with SlipKnot like he does with murderdolls!)
B0000C7PSW|1.0|This is my first Rufus Wainwright CD so I want to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. <br />However, I found this album to be nauseatingly boring. Rufus does not have sufficient modulation to his voice so it sounds like he's holding notes way too long till they actually make your head hurt with the repetition.<br />I'm sorry I bought this CD and wish I could get my money back.
B000067CPX|4.0|all you people saying this album is a sell out album, you sure [as hell] don't know nothing about the band. Why is it that when a band releases a new album that sounds different than there old stuff they are considered sell outs. The fact is that the peppers are not sell outs and they will never sell more albums than with blood sugur sex magic. That is indeed a better album but they have changed alot as people since then. Who, besides the simple minded and short attention spanned people, wants the same ablums over and  over. All of you who call this album sell out have to realize the the band has been through so much since 1991's BSSM.  They have seen monster success, heroin addictions, the near death of one of the greatest guitar players of our time, and an odds defying comeback.  This more emotional album is a reflection of these events that the guys have seen. You hear it in the lyrics and the melodies. Even if it does fit the radio friendly category, it sounds damn good and sounds a hell of a lot better than ANY rock group out there except mars volta (flea plays bass on their new album) and radiohead. All the songwriting and solos and basslines and drumming here is better than anything on the radio. I love there old stuff but i constantly listen to tracks on this album like universally speaking, this is the place, don't forget me, i could die for you, tear, and on mercury. This is truly a standout album. All you bashers of this album should grow up, get off kazza or morpheus or the radio and appreciate good music
B0000E1WKE|2.0|With her last album, the disastrous &quot;Just Whitney&quot;, I thought that I had given up on Whitney. I had had it - the damaged voice, the lukewarm production, the third-rate material, the failed attempts to make contemporary R&amp;B music - enough was enough. I had been a fan through thick (her first two albums, the &quot;Preacher's Wife&quot; soundtrack) and thin (the disastrous &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;), but I was starting to feel quite let down by this former prodigy. When I heard that she was going to release a Christmas album, I changed my mind. I thought, &quot;Christmas music is so good, and Whitney can sing so beautifully when she puts her heart into it&quot;, that it sounded like a can't-miss deal. So I bought it.<br />Sad to say, after a few listens, that Whitney has managed to miss... for the most part. Songs like &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;The First Noel&quot;, &quot;Deck The Halls / Silent Night&quot; and especially &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas&quot; are painful to listen to because of the way Whitney desperately avoids singing the right notes, bending and twisting her way around the real melody of those evergreens, using twelve notes in each word to hide the fact that she really can't hit just one note on the head anymore. Whitney used to possess the most beautiful voice in the world, rich, textured, expressive, emotional. Her singing on those songs is just plain flat, and as a former huge fan of hers, it's heart-wrenching to hear that even the studio wizardry cannot hide the fact that she has lost those magic vocal abilities. The biggest shock is to hear her child sing on &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; and feel that she sings better and more expressively than Mommy does. Ouch. The production itself is just plain lazy, once again pushing Whitney in a direction where she doesn't belong, meaning the diluted form of R&amp;B that pretends to be contemporary black music. <br />So what saves this album from being an epic disaster ?Well, for once, there is an expressive and heartfelt version of &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, featuring a more traditional arrangement, that proves that Whitney could still do it all over again if she really wanted to. Including two songs from the soundtrack of &quot;The Preacher's Wife&quot; is a shameless exploitaton of her fans, but those two songs are beautiful indeed. And the a capella version of &quot;O Come, O Come Emmanuel&quot; (featuring delicious vocal interplay with backup singers) is just sublime. They prove that, given the right material and the right production skills, Whitney can still reach your heart.<br />I wish she had recorded this album ten years ago, when she still had total control of her voice, and when she could still sing a straight melody without retorting to cheap vocal gymnastics. What a  truly wonderful Christmas present it could have been...
B00000JR2A|5.0|This is the &quot;Sgt Pepper's&quot; of the late 1980's, and it even looks similar!  A great CD from an under-rated band.  Thier range of musical styles and talent has been underappreciated because of thier being lumped into the &quot;80's&quot; pop band genre.  Don't be misled by critics, this is outstanding from beginning to end.  Of special note is the work by Oleta Adams, who was discovered by the band, and the singing of Curt Smith.  Curt doesn't have the range of voice that his bandmate Roland does, but adds more soul.  Also, try and get the VCD of &quot;Going to California&quot; which is the live tour from this release.  Takes the music to an even higher level and adds some treats as well.  One of the best recorded works of the 80's, and &quot;timeless&quot;.  The extra tracks are also excellent.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I love jazz and the whole neosoul vibe;so I have to say this is a good album.<br />From other reviews, i've read on here people say &quot;Songs in A minor,&quot; is a better album. Pft, yeah right, what are ya'll smoking?<br />&quot;Diary of Alicia Keyes,&quot; is ten times better. All the songs just flow so well compared to the last album.<br />I think I liked about three songs from &quot;Songs in A Minor,&quot; with this album I like almost all the track.<br />I love the first single, and  &quot;Nobody not really,&quot; *wink*<br />Like the other reviewers said, purchase this album if you love real music.<br />I'm out!
0385504209|5.0|Before I begin I'ld just like to say that just because a book is exciting and keeps you enthralled does not make it poor literature.  I read this book in 48 hours and I still maintain that it was time well spent.  This entire book was filled with surprises and twists.  The protagonist, Robert Lagdon, along with Sophia Neveau find themselves on a wild journey from the Mona Lisa in Paris, to Westminster Abbey in England trying to find the secret to the Holy Grail.  But this is no treasure hunt, the Grail holds a disturbing secret, that if revealed would mean a drastic change in Western religion, thats not very clear but its hard not to give anything away.  The riddles and mysteries that they uncover are brillient, and have sometimes triple or quadruple meanings that all connect in the end.  The book may not end in with a huge bang but I felt it was fitting and beautiful. Everything is wrapped up and concluded nicely.  In conclusion, The DaVinci Code is facinating, suspensful, and completely opens the doors to new ideas about Christianity.  Just thinking about how all the riddles and symbols came together, I can only wonder at how Dan Brown did it.
0380002930|1.0|Everyone says how this book is wonderful and has a greater meaning and the descriptions are wonderful blah blah blah..I had to read this book in english class and write reviews on it and answer questions I have never read anything more boring in my life! And one that loves to read..I couldn't believe what I was reading...When he's trying to explain how Fiver is scared in like 5 pages of details...no wonder i was getting more sleep lately ;) he could've easily cut the book half,if he didn't put so much detail into it... Maybe if I could actually not fall asleep after a page of reading I could describe how utterly flat and repetitive this book is. I hope you never have to go through reading this book....<br />P.S. I recommend you to read Confessions of A Shopaholic (it's hilarious)
B0000DD7NL|5.0|YOU CANNOT COMPARE BRITNEY SPEARS TO ALICIA KEYES!!!!  BRITNEY HAS NO SINGING ABILITY....ALL SHE DOES IS DANCE AND GET NAKED!

0385504209|5.0|This is by far one of the finest books I have ever read.  Those giving it bad reviews fear the truths the book reveals.  Yes, it is a &quot;page-turner&quot; and yes, it moves at breakneck speed, but that is what a good book is supposed to do.  I could not put it down and frankly, didn't want to.  Dan Brown has written a masterpiece that will live throughout the ages.  Are all the ideas original? No, but it took brown to bring them into the mainstream and make it a convincing enjoyable read.  Don't let the zealots keep you from reading this book!!!
B00009UW0N|5.0|Review Edited due to IMDb's word limit.<br />You can thank William Shatner for &quot;Halloween.&quot; It is his face, after all, that the infamous Michael Myers (Nick Castle) wears in the shadows of &quot;Halloween,&quot; spray painted white and its hair frizzled up in all directions. Michael is always in the shadows, an ever-present force with hints of supernatural evil.<br />And that is where the granddaddy of horror film exceeds where all the others fail -- in its suspense, and not in its exploitation of horror. Michael Myers exists in the shadows as a primal fear in &quot;Halloween,&quot; preying on innocent passersby. And although it has been falsely mistaken to be a bloody slasher film over the years since its release, primarily thanks to its many sequels and uncountable rip-offs, the film features virtually no blood whatsoever. No, the film goes for real scares rather than blood and guts. It's the &quot;Psycho&quot; of its generation, and it pays its respects to Hitchcock in more than just the literal sense.<br />Its imitators and sequels (the ninth film coming out next year) all lost sight of this. Over the years, &quot;Halloween&quot; has been slowly but surely regarded with less and less respect, simply because its imitators used its original ideas so much they turned into clich&eacute;s. By today's standards, &quot;Halloween&quot; may look tame and quite routine, but you must understand that back in 1978 it was anything but average and typical.<br />And despite the clich&eacute;s, I still don't consider it average because John Carpenter knows how to use the camera to his advantage. It's the subtle stuff that counts -- such as the fact that we take the first person view of Michael Myers as a child, while he murders his older sister in cold blood. But after his parents unveil him, we never assume his perspective ever again. Sometimes we think we are, but then we see Michael's outline appear by the camera or far away from the camera. (Though this was ruined when the film was chopped for TV and Michael Myers wasn't always viewable off screen due to standard format.)<br />The camera also takes on the eerie presence of a third person  -- when Michael attacks Laurie in that coat closet, you're in there with her. When she runs along the street looking for help, Carpenter uses a dolly shot and makes the effect exist as though we are with her. As Michael drives the stolen car through Haddonfield, we're in the back seat with him. We're always with the characters, which is a very subtle but effective technique that Carpenter uses, separating it from the other slasher films. It is as though we become an unmentioned character ourselves. It almost turns the film into a sort of adventure ride.<br />The film opens on Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, 1963. A young girl named Judith Myers is murdered by her 6-year-old brother, Michael.<br />1978. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) has been following Michael's case since its birth in 1963. He worked for eight years trying to reach the boy, to connect with him. (&quot;He hasn't spoken a word for fifteen years.&quot;) Loomis worked another seven years trying to keep Michael locked up forever, after realizing what existed behind the boy's cold eyes was purely and simply evil. But now, the night of his transportation to a court hearing, Michael has escaped from confinement, and Loomis knows where he's headed: back to Haddonfield.<br />Michael does come back to Haddonfield, and there he preys on innocent virginal schoolgirl Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), left to baby sit two children on Halloween night. Meanwhile, Dr. Sam Loomis walks around town searching for Michael and saying such fun, clich&eacute;d lines as, &quot;It's your funeral!&quot;, &quot;He came home,&quot; and &quot;Evil has come to your small town, Sheriff.&quot;<br />One of the many keys to the film is Michael's hinted supernatural power. Now it's common fodder to feature supernatural bad guys in horror flicks, but back then nothing had made a villain into a supernatural mad man incarnate before -- not even &quot;Psycho.&quot; Michael is the villain who always knows where to hide, where the hero(ine) is hiding, how to position himself in the shadows without being seen, and how to always be a step ahead of everyone else. He can appear to a single person in front of a bush and then disappear behind it, gone from sight forever. The supernatural eeriness of the character was copied in the 1986 thriller &quot;The Hitcher,&quot; where Rutger Hauer played a homicidal hitchhiker trying to prey on a young boy for no reason whatsoever. Hauer was played as a supernatural character but the film failed to make any sense of anything, wandering back and forth between a mortal foe and an immortal one. It also hinted that there was a purpose behind Hauer's killing spree, which was never delved into.<br />&quot;Halloween&quot; is smarter. Myers has not motive for killing. And instead of constantly featuring him on screen, Michael is revealed slowly and slowly, piece by piece. First the shoulders. Then the back of the head. Then the face from a distance. A bit closer. But he never walks around in the daylight, right in front of the camera, because that would completely diminish the film's creepiness.

He is still a dark figure.<br />All the sequels and rip-offs burned the storyline to the ground. In retrospect, &quot;Halloween&quot; is very predictable. But it still has a distinctly subtle style of psychological horror that all the other gratuitously violent slasher cash-ins lost. This is the granddaddy of teen slasher movies, and always will be. And after you get past the fact that it started an entire franchise of unwanted motion pictures, you'll realize that there's a lot more to &quot;Halloween&quot; than meets the eye. It's a cut above the rest, so to speak.g had made a villain into a supernatural mad man incarnate before -- not even &quot;Psycho.&quot; Michael is the villain who always knows where to hide, where the hero(ine) is hiding, how to position himself in the shadows without being seen, and how to always be a step ahead of everyone else. He can appear to a single person in front of a bush and then disappear behind it, gone from sight forever. The supernatural eeriness of the character was copied in the 1986 thriller &quot;The Hitcher,&quot; where Rutger Hauer played a homicidal hitchhiker trying to prey on a young boy for no reason whatsoever. Hauer was played as a supernatural character but the film failed to make any sense of anything, wandering back and forth between a mortal foe and an immortal one. It also hinted that there was a purpose behind Hauer's killing spree, which was never delved into.<br />&quot;Halloween&quot; is smarter. Myers has not motive for killing.

B0000CDLA7|2.0|Since Images and Words, DT has progressively (pun intended) put more and more emphasis on chops and the expense of songs.  What made Images &amp; Words and Awake so great was that they had these incredible instrumental passages *within* great songs.  But no longer.  Now the &quot;songs&quot; are just excuses to go wheedlywheedlywheedly at blazing fast speeds.  Too bad.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I can't believe people are dumb enough to say that Brittney &quot;No Talent&quot; Spears can even try and be on the same level as Ms. Alicia Keys. Alicia Keys won more Grammys for her first CD than Brittney has won all together. This CD is tight and it just excells Ms. Keys Skillz higher and higher this CD is worth bying instead of just downloading.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I had been anticipating her next French album, and when I first heard a piece of the title track Tout L'or Des Hommes, I didn't like it, until I heard the entire album. <BR>Wow!<BR>This album is unlike any other album I've heard.<BR>I'm a devoted Celine Dion fan, and this album makes me even more devoted. Her English album are good, bur her French album are even better. Purchase this CD, and you too will be amazed. Don't let the fact that it's in French deter you, it will make you appreciate her voice even more. Hopefull her next Enlish album will cover such a wide area of styles.<BR>Loved it!
B000089RVR|5.0|I didn't know Dido had come out with a second album and then I heard &quot;White Flag&quot; on the WB show Tarzan and ran out to get a copy.  I think Dido is one of the most passionate vocalists we have today.  Hearing her song fit so perfectly into the romance of the show!  I was blown away by it!  :)
B00005Y7L4|5.0|This is a great movie. The plot: Children are refusing to go to school and disobeying parents, so the government institutes BR(Battle Royale) to put the kids in their place.  Class 3B, 9th graders, are all drugged and shipped to a deserted island where only one student can be the survivor.  Each student is given a bag with supplies for their three day adventure and a miscellaniouse weapon.<BR>I liked this movie soooo much because it made you think and also because the interaction between the students was intriguing. After all how would you behave if you had to kill your friends and class mates?
0452281881|5.0|A refreshing story told totally in e-mail format, unlike the usual tiresome prose.......n funny as hell too.  it's almost impossible to stiffle my laughter n giggling sounds whilst travelling in a crowded public transport.  the characters n the office politics depicted are so true n realistic......even reminded me of some colleagues that i've encountered......<BR>the e-mails r a good format where we r only given an account of a story in pieces n to hv a complete picture, we hv to continue reading the book.<BR>a great read to those who has to endure the long journeys to work or travels.
B00005JM02|5.0|From the dim-witted Dory to the unfunny clownfish Marlin, this epic adventure has a character everyone will love.  Crush and his offspring are totally surfer dudes!  Nemo's friends at the dentist's office are lovable.  The best characters, however, are the gulls.  Pixar has captured the true essence of these annoying &quot;dump ducks.&quot;
B0000DZ3EA|3.0|Peter Gabriel is royalty in the music world. No one has taken the chances he's taken and been this successful. This collection simply cannot get more than 3 stars due to the fact that PG 3 (scratch cover) is not represented at all. DIY should have been automatically included.<br />One good thing however;All his albums are great so just buy the scratch album anyway along with the rest because with Peter Gabriels music you can't go wrong.<br />Buy all the remastered cds
B000021XR5|5.0|STP's No. 4 album, perhaps not as good as Core or Purple but there most diverse one to date. The album just flows from track to track. Its starts out awesome and ends even Better. \\"Down\\" a great Hard Rock track, has a great guitar lick and Wieland matches it with a soundgarden/zeppelin touch. Other tracks tracks like No way Out, Sex and Violence, Heaven and Hot Rods, make the album worth more then just the radio hit Sour Girl. The album ends with one of my favorite STP songs \\"Atlanta,\\" The track has a almost Jim Morrison (the Doors) sound too it, and it is one of the best (vocal wise) Scott Wieland has ever sounded. Check it out....
0060392886|5.0|It just gets better everytime!  I have had this book for about 2 years now.  I read it about every 6 months and each time I find something that I didn't find before.  I have had NUMEROUS friends borrow it and read it to the point that the front cover is all ripped up from it being read so much.  Just an all around great read for a girl like me who lived and loved the 80's and was got kicked off the cheerleading team for wearing a MOTLEY t shirt to school.  My ultimate dream is that one day in the near future that they will put there sh*t together and go on one more kick a** tour...I would be in the front row.  I love Motley and always will..they define the 80's for me which was also the GREATEST time of my life.  Please read it over and over and share it with friends.  It is well worth it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|While her voice seems to be deteriorating, her music and beats just keeps getting better and better.  That goes for her lyrics as well.  True, Britney Spears is no Whitney Houston, but why all the comparisons?  If all artists were equally talented, there wouldn't be any variety or actual \\"favorites\\" because they would all be the same.  So for all those 'critics' out there, enough with comparisons yeah?  How about trying to focus on what each individual is capable of producing. Here's a song-by-song review.<br />1. Me Against The Music- While this song doesn't suck, it obviously isn't good enough to be a 'hit' single.  Perhaps a different single should have been used.  Madonna doesn't offer much to this song, but it does tend to grow on you. 7/10<BR>2. (I Got That) Boom Boom- Personally, The Ying Yang Twins were a horrible choice as artists featured on a Britney Spears album.  The song has an interesting sound with the banjo and all and her voice is heard so it does okay.  I doubt it would make a strong single. 8/10  <BR>3. Showdown- at first I could not stand this song.  It has interesting lyrics that aren't too 'pop' and the music is decent.  Britney shows signs of improvement on her songwriting skills and attempts. 8/10<BR>4. Breathe On Me- This song is amazing.  Notice I said song and not the lyrics or the singer herself.  I really wish that Britney would belt out some more high notes as she did in 'Where Are You Know' on \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\".  She has some great beats and the music gets you moving.  A great song. 10/10<BR>5. Early Mornin'- I would have named this song 'Early Moanin''.  I often wonder why Britney is either afraid of her voice or does not wish to put it to good use.  All this moanin', whisperin', and gigglin' is not singing.  Moby produced this song and I personally don't like Moby. 6/10<BR>6.Toxic- this song, I would consider one of the best songs ever produced onto Britney's album.  This song has great music to it with it's violin sound and it's great.  The lyrics aren't half bad and Miss Spears is actually singing! 10/10<BR>7.Outrageous- it is obvious that R. Kelly helped produce this.  His sound is very distinct and this song is decent.  Although, the word 'outrageous' is over used. 8/10<BR>8.Touch of My Hand- ah yes.  The defining song of the album.  It is sex driven and offers some very intimate lyrics.  However, the song is not bad.  It is influenced by Asian music and is possibly one of the best songs on the album. 10/10<BR>9. The Hook Up- not a great song but has some great beats.  There is one part of the song, somewhere in the middle?  The singing is really fast, and one has to doubt whether it is really Britney singing or not. 7/10<BR>10. Shadow- finally! A vocal song! The lyrics are a bit lame, the music isn't great, but at least she finally proves cynics wrong.  Yeah, she doesn't have Aguilera pipes, but she does pretty well on this song.  For Spears, it's quite good. 9/10<BR>11. Brave New Girl- it contains a choppy chorus with decent rapping, but bad lyrics.  It does have some good beats, but the whole robotic-digitalized-voice-changing thing makes it bad.  Why doesn't she stick to her own voice? 6/10<BR>12. Everytime- Ah...a ballad.  A ballad that isn't horrific, but not exactly \\"Beautiful\\".  She is all-alone on this track, no backups.  Just Britney and her voice.  Soothing no? 10/10<BR>13. Me Against The Music Remix- One of the best remixes I have ever heard.  It isn't too different, and I prefer this over the original.  9/10<br />Overall- 8/10<br />I would have enjoyed this album so much more if Spears' voice were put more to use.  What is she so afraid of?  Is her voice that bad? I honestly think that she would sell more albums and appeal to more people without this entire \\"cleanup\\" in her music.  What is wrong with organic stuff?  I rather hear her voice crack a little while she is belting out high notes, then have the entire songs crisp and clear.  But Britney, you keep doing what youare doing.  You rock!
B000099T2L|2.0|Bought it based on the first cut single- big mistake. rest of albums stinks, trite corny lyrics ala: the signs song, baby boy also corny lyrics, only thing that made it radio-playable is the beat. bottomline:not to buy
0385504209|2.0|If this is an example of a good triller or good fiction I am surprised.  Although the  premise could be interesting the constant chase and riddles detracted from the  possible intiguing story that would change history!  Don't waste your time on this one
B0000C6E4D|2.0|from an objective point of view, this was not a good album by any standard. muscially it was poorly done, - voice hidden under layers of computer-generated music: bad - very bad. content wise it's very short, and lyrically not up to par. 'fallen is not enough to make it a good album. bottom-line: refrain from purchasing.
B000001DYJ|1.0|Another Alive but not really &#34;LIVE&#34; Kiss experience.  Every Alive album is patched and polished prior to release to give it that &#34;authentic&#34; alive Kiss sound.  Sham release.  80's Kiss to more Alive polish......nuff said.
B000063Y8F|2.0|What a disappointment, this was supposed to be the best garlic-press available, yet upon pressing just the second clove of garlic it bent, slightly yes, but now the snap-close feature no longer works so when it is hung on a hook it falls open. If it cost $10-$15 I would probably keep it as it does do a great job of pressing garlic and it is easy to clean but at $35 I expect it to be prefect. So I am returning it. It is truly a shame as if they just made it with slightly thicker steel it probably would be the finest press available. Depressing.
B0000UMD00|1.0|Go get some Rock N ROLL this pop crap from this worthless artist sucks.
B00000JG41|5.0|Mr. Bungle are the musical equivalent of filmmaker Terence Malick. They both have a very small body of work (Bungle with 3 full-length albums and Malick with 3 movies) and both manage to top their previous work with every subsequent effort.<br />California is no different. At first, it almost seems like Bungle has gone mainstream with ballads and harmonies but this album is very deceptive. There is a lot going on, here. The boys follow their usual M.O. of mixing several musical genres together in one song and making it work. &quot;Air Conditioned Nightmare&quot; for example, blends doo-wop singing with metal riffs. Other songs mix rockabilly guitar riffs with traditional orchestration, and, in perhaps the most inspired combo, Gypsy music is mixed with death metal.<br />Mike Patton continues to inspire awe with his incredible vocal range. This man can sing practically anything... and does. One would think that a lot of studio trickery goes into producing this fantastic range but see the man live and find out for yourself what a musical genius he really is.<br />While this album will never be recognized for the masterwork that it truly is by music critics/writers, I daresay it deserves a place up in the pantheon of other classics (Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper, Metaphysical Graffitti, etc.). This is an incredible album for people who like challenging music.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Outstanding movie.  Enjoyed greatly by all in my household, ages 6 - 45.  Intelligent writing, great storytelling and acting, beautiful message and flawless execution.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|A MUST SEE for bodybuilding lovers.<BR>i just can't understand how someone can give less than 5 stars on this movie. I watched 10 years ago! A pirate copy that a friend brought me from USA.<BR>Its not the movie by itself, its the message it gaves, how it was built (there is the making of now!), and WHO was involved on the project.<BR>i loved the Extra Features, i got emotional and happy to see all that caractheres 25 years later, what they did, and what they are doing now. The movie is historical!<br />I believe only bodybuilders, workout lovers, gym lovers.<BR>people who had their own history, built by years and years in a gym, with old friends, or making new ones by the time goes on, getting fun, can really understand the historical and emotional impact of Pumping Iron.<br />I am 200% satisfied, i did my pre-order 3 months ago and i hope to congratulate some of the carachteres personally one day,<BR>it well worth it, it well deserve the DVD 25º aniversary<BR>Congratulations and thanks! thanks a lot!! really!<br />Stealth
0385504209|4.0|This book kept my eyes glued to it!  The plot compiles one conflict on top of another and switches point-of-view frequently.  In doing so, Brown keeps the reader in suspense.  The symbology also give something to think about.  CHRISTIANS BEWARE, I am a staunch believer in Jesus Christ, and at times in the novel some of the conversations made me cringe.  It is not that the story presents Christianity in a bad light(excluding Opus Dei), it is that it makes no distinction between the fact and fiction.  Either way, the book is a great read and was definitely worth my time.
B00008CLOA|2.0|The album will cure your insomnia though.  Five minutes and you'll be out like a light. Given that I despise Pink Floyd, I will say that this is their finest album. See, there's a compliment after all!<br />I don't do drugs.  Maybe I should start taking them if I want to appreciate this band.
0783233477|5.0|A great flick. Really. Subtle and enjoyable, and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard. You know, one could think of fan-fiction to go with this film. What if Death impregnated Susan during their trust? There'd be a little Deathline running around, looking like young Brad Pitt but able to perform supernatural powers, including killing anyone, with a touch. Intersting...
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I am most likely not going to pursuade anyone who has not liked the Matrix sequels to like them.  However, it is interesting to see such polarizing effect from Reloaded and now Revolutions.  I personally enjoyed both.  The films played out the idea of a few humans struggling against a machine dominated world nicely.  It is definitely not a Hollywood happy ending sort of series.  Reloaded can be ponderous at times but if it is at fault being pretentious, it is at least thought provoking---hence such extreme feelings.  I think people who are disappointed with the sequels simply want to have a nice and coherent explaination and resolution of the story.  Reloaded doesn't provide that; in fact, it turns what is learned in the original movie upside down by revealing just how much the machines are in control.  If one can deal with that disappointment and is not expecting a tidy Hollywood ending, it is a very satisfying film.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peter Jackson and his team sure know how to put together a DVD!  As with the 'Fellowship' extended edition, this one is packed with additional footage and behind the scenes extras.  There was a day when &quot;additional footage&quot; meant some unfinished junk that clearly needed to be cut from a movie as it was unwatchable.  But not here.  Every added scene blends flawlessly into the movie and has meaning and enriches the story further. The 'behind-the-scenes' footage is very thorough and entertaining, as well. <BR>A great story, great extras, and well worth the investment.<BR>By the way, for one reviewer, Tolkien wrote LOTR in the Twentieth Century.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|1) The \\"Hey, Jude\\" album, including \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", was released on Apple records (not a bootleg company, boys and girls) as SO-385/SW-385 on February 26, 1970. The original and true \\"Let It Be\\" was released on June 18, 1970 (in the UK on May 8, 1970). <br />2) This is John Lennon's assessment of Phil Spector's work on \\"Let It Be\\": &quot;He [Spector] was given the [scatological expletive]-est load of badly recorded [scatological expletive] with a lousy feeling to it ever, and he made something out of it. He did a great job.&quot;<br />3) This is what Rolling Stone Magazine has to say about Naked: \\"The unfortunate truth is that John Lennon and George Harrison are dead, and, whatever its merits, Naked exists essentially as an excuse for Paul McCartney, after decades of complaining, to finally remove Phil Spector's production effects from 'The Long and Winding Road.' As a result, the song -- a technologically souped-up version of the take in the Let It Be film -- now sounds like a vaguely interesting demo, rather than the lavish (and frankly emotional) epitaph for the Beatles that Spector turned it into.\\"
0609610570|1.0|Execution? How about duplication! This book builds itself as a discipline for getting things done. The leader's seven essential building blocks don't offer anything new or insightful. The idea that you and your organization will be able to better execute because of this book is a laugh.<br />Bravo to the marketing genius that put this together!
B000002513|4.0|I'll say this for Bruce - he can truly write.  His lyrics alone make this album listenable. For years I had this album simply for Rosalita, ignoring the other tracks.  I'm glad I listened to the whole thing, finally.  The use of horns (a tuba?) seems odd at times, but it all seems to work.  <br />Rosalita remains the standout.  A masterpiece of lyrical proportions.
B00000F3KL|5.0|along the lines of Saving Private Ryan, The Longest Day and The Thin Red Line, Black Hawk Down scores threw the streets of Somalia. the cast are excellent. Josh Hartnett(Blow Dry, Hollywood Homicide), Eric Bana(The Hulk, Chopper), Ewan McGregor(Rouge Trader, NightWatch), Sam Shepard(Hamlet2000, SwordFish), Jason Issacs(The Patriot, Event Horizon), Ewen Bremner(Trainspotting, Pearl Harbor), William Fichtner(Heat, Armageddon),Tom Sizemore(Heat, Dreamcatcher), Ron Eldard(The Last Supper, Mystery, Alaska), Ricahrd Tyson(Battlefield Earth, Two Moon Junction), Jeremy Piven(Serendipity, Red Letters),Zeljko Ivanek(Tv's Angel), Tom Guiry(Tigerland, All I Wanna Do), Orlando Bloom(Pirates Of The Carribean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl), Kim Coates(The Last Boy Scout, Battlefield Earth), Brian Van Holt, Brenden Sexton III(Desert Blue, Boys Dont Cry), and Gabriel Casseus(Black Dog). filled with nonstop, pulsepounding action sequences and gruesome war torture and that part where Josh Hartnett has to a vein on the guys cut off hand from stop bleeding is a stomachturned. highlight is when Ewan McGregor is shot at by a missle and theres a big explosion, the other guy comes to him and he asks him if hes ok, Ewan says my ears or ringing..or something like that, it was awesome
B000001DYJ|4.0|I know \\"Alive I & II\\" are incredible, but if you're a fan of 80's Kiss, THIS is the live disc you want. It's got \\"Heaven's On Fire\\", \\"Lick It Up\\", and \\"Forever\\". Then it includes four choice cuts from the \\"Revenge\\" album: \\"I Just Wanna\\", \\"Unholy\\", \\"Domino\\", and \\"God Gave Rock N' Roll To You\\". Plus the classic tracks \\"Deuce\\", \\"Detroit Rock City\\", and of course \\"Rock N' Roll All Night\\", among others. 16 awesome live tracks from Kiss. If you're looking for the studio companion to this, minus the Revenge tracks, check out \\"Smashes, Thrashes, & Hits\\".
B0000CD5I6|1.0|&gt;Next, he says &quot;You've heard these songs before.&quot; Not true. Many of the songs appear on this CD for the first time.<br />Okay, you've heard MOST of these songs before. Happy?<br />&gt;Finally, he labels the band tired and uninspired without providing any evidence to back up his claim. Pretty typical of these types of people to make bogus claims without offering a shred of substantiation to back them up. The fact is the band sounds great, Ian's voice is strong and lyrical, the arrangements are creative and beautiful, and the CD as a whole is a real treat. &quot;A Music Fan,&quot; get your facts straight before making absurd assertions.<br />Look up &quot;fact&quot; in a dictionary. In my opinion, the band sounds tired and uninspired. In your opinion it may not, but your OPINION is not a &quot;fact&quot;. (On the other hand, if you've heard Ian Anderson sing any time in 2003, and you think he hasn't lost his voice, consider having your hearing checked.) <br />Notice how intolerant Jethro Tull fanatics are of dissenting opinions and how abusive they are, and then take all the rave reviews here with several large shakers of salt.
B00009MGQL|1.0|I'm not sure what is worse; the new Jeff Beck CD or all the reviewers giving it 5 stars. Seriously, as I began listening to this CD in my car, my first reaction was to literally throw it out the window.<br />What Jeff has done is taken his beautifully crafted, melodic songs and completely thrown them out in exchange for lifeless, uninspired, beat box-rap-house-hip hop crap. Whatever happened to the great drumming of Simon Phillips or Terry Bozzio? I'm not expecting &quot;Wired 2&quot; or &quot;Blow By Blow Redux.&quot; Just something with some life to it.<br />Sorry Jeff. I'm being generous and giving you 1 star and zero stars to all of the misguided reviewers who have forgotten (or never heard) Jeff Beck's masterpieces from the seventies. Say I'm stuck in the past but brilliant work is brilliant work - no matter how old it is.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Take away the dreadful &quot;Mother,&quot; and you have yourself a perfect album.  It makes you wonder where this band could have gone had they stayed together.  Sting peaked after this with Blue Turtles.
630428540X|4.0|John Travolta stars as a man who one day is struck by a bright light and then the next thing you know he is s super genius in which he knows everything about anything and he spits it out in a split second. Effective drama with John Travolta giving out a beautiful and charming performance. Also starring Forest Whitaker and Robert DuVall in wonderful supporting roles. The end of the movie is the most emotional and sparks the most waterworks, though I didnt cry I really thought it was devastating to see Travolta's character die. This is a sure winner.
B000009ED0|4.0|&quot;Kid Rock&quot; may be feelin' his country roots recently, but this is  his best rap/rock offering. Great lyrics too. You know you're getting into something sweet when the first track &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; kicks in. This whole disc is a great example of what can happen when mixing genres is done the right way. It's overall the best mix of rap/rock since &quot;Fight For Your Right To Party&quot;. Other impressive tracks here are &quot;Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot;. Plus this has one of the best power-ballads since the hair-metal days, &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;. But what I like most about &quot;Kid Rock&quot;, is that besides the skills, he's pretty down to earth, and he's not trying to be too deep, he just wants to have fun. This is a fun album.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The soundtrack for the The Fellowship of the Ring is as perfect as the movie itself. Shore collaborated closely with director Peter Jackson to really have an understanding of the world of Middle Earth and its inhabitants. You can literally listen to the music and close your eyes and have a clear idea of what is happening to Frodo and Sam and their chance encounter with Merry and Pippin. The Prophecy is haunting and plays well to the storied past of what the ring has been through. The music reaches a heroic pitch in The Ring goes South as the Fellowship is completely formed. From there the music becomes quite dark and somber as the Fellowship experiences hardships and terrible loss. It ends with resolve and the will to go on in The Breaking of the Fellowship. Memorable themes are definitely Concerning Hobbit, Treason of Isengard, Flight to the Ford, Anorien, The Bridge of Khaza-dum, Amon Hen, and the Breaking of the Fellowship. Howard Shore deservedly won an Academy Award for this album. If you are a huge Tolkien fan and a big fan of the movie then it is more than likely a guarantee that this album may bring a tear to your eyes. It is beautiful and is what other movie soundtracks should aspire to. It play perfectly to the movie it represents.
B00000DHTF|5.0|What a Christmas gift this was!  While this collection isn't a great idea for the casual fan, for the longtime Springsteen fan it's gold, and the vault still isn't empty!  Available bootlegs of tapes spirited (in the night) out of sessions over the years show an amazing amount of high quality music that still hasn't seen the official light of day.  I'm always up for an album of new original material, but anytime Bruce feels the need to toss out a bone like this one, I'm buying.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Zimmer's new score for the epic canvas of a film is truly a revelation.  This is among Zimmer's finest music, though that is becoming a cliche these days with him.  He just keeps getting better and better, borrowing from his old works, inverting them and turning them into something new and refreshing, but just new enough to know that what you're listening to is the great Hans Zimmer.  This soundtrack brings to mind the vivid imagery of the film (the battlefields, colorful villages perched upon serene mountain tops, many other images reminiscent of Kurosawa's films), but even better, just like of Zimmer's other great works, the music has a life of its own.  You can take this music and apply it to your own life.<br />Every track is fantastic.  Each manages to have the reflective, weepy, and somber strings of &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; mixed in with the dramatic punches of &quot;Pearl Harbor, Crimson Tide, Gladiator&quot; and many of his other works. But those who loved the profound depth of &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; FANS WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.  The non-action music has the same beautiful melodies of his work from that soundtrack, except that it has its own distinct own voice.  Zimmer sprinkles the entire soundtrack with wonderful flavors from Japan, but not too much.  He applies just the right amount, without turning the music into stereotypical international fluff.  He goes beyond the borders of cultures, just as he did in Thin Red Line, and finds that place that is within every person's soul and expresses it with his masterful command of strings.<br />The action cues are amazing.  They are memorable and impossible to forget; very heroic and powerful without being too contrived. the bridge between track 10 and 11 sounds JUST like the bridge in THIN RED LINE tracks 8 and 9. <br />Track 1: &quot;A way of life&quot; has great cues that sound like ponderous Thin Red line and then heroic cues sounding like Gladiator and even a little black hawk down. <br />&quot;Spectres in the fog&quot; starts off with a nice meoldy that is one of the main themes in the soundtrack the turns into a grat action piece<br />&quot;Taken&quot; has an adventure feel reprising the action main theme<br />&quot;a hard teacher&quot; is a lot like &quot;light&quot; from thin red line; thinking melodic music<br />&quot;to know my enemy&quot; is a good dramatic piece and gets very good and dramatic near the end<br />&quot;Idyll's end&quot; is another great one; starts off very subtle and beautifully melodic then turns into a great heroic theme with shades of gladiator<br />&quot;safe passage&quot; is a weepy melancholy tune that has shades of the &quot;attack&quot; from pearl harbor<br />&quot;ronin&quot; is a great short track that starts out sof then jumps to some of the loudest finest percussion beats youll ever hear, slightly echoing the heroism of black hawk down and gladiator.<br />&quot;red warrior&quot; is a great action track that sets the scene for the big battle<br />&quot;the way of the sword&quot; is a great action adrenaline-pumping track with equally great melodies.  the part from 2:45 to 4:50 is truly powerful and when you match it with the specific scene from the film, you'll know what I mean.  a great &quot;dying on the battlefield song&quot;  What follows is similar to the high blissful strings that wrap up &quot;journey to the line&quot; soaring to the highest peaks.<br />&quot;a small measure of peace&quot; is the last track and brings great closure to the CD with beautiful and haunting melodies, a la thin red line once again.  reprises the quiet subtle theme that is present in track 1 and track 6.<br />well thats the lowdown. obviously I can't recommend it enough, fans of Hans Zimmer/ film scores or not.  This is good music for anything; workout, doing work, thinking and reflecting on life. I've already listened to it about 8 times and it truly gets better every tinme I hear it.  Very haunting melodic and beautiful zimmer has outdone himself once again.  I didnt think he could do it after black hawk down, gladiator, and thin red line.  as I said, all of these songs sound like his previous works, except they all have a new refreshing sound and a slight Japanese flavor thrown in there.  A great CD not just for the sake of the film, but for anythin outside of it.
B000002JOH|5.0|Vulgar Display Of Power is one of the most influential metal records of the 90's. Phil Anselmo traded his hairband high pitch yells on Cowboys From Hell for pure screaming metal, Dimebag and Rex turn in some of the most grinding riffs ever, and Vinnie Paul is today's modern metal drummer. Every song on this album totally proves that Pantera is capable of hardcore rocking. Mouth For War, A New Level, Walk, hollow, and every song on this album, Pantera deserves some RE- SPECT!
B00005ARDC|4.0|This is easily one of the best albums I've picked up the past couple years, and despite the recent return of garage rock, \\"B.R.M.C.\\" has filled a void many of those bands couldn't, elements of shoegazing. \\"Whatever Happened To My Rock n' Roll [punk song]\\" may be the single here, but the rest of this, though similar, is less aggressive, and more fluid and dreamy, especially \\"Too Real\\" and \\"Salvation\\". I like the look of these guys too, it matches the music well. As far as originality goes, almost everyone sounds like someone else, and if that's the worst thing about this band, may they rock for many years to come.
0385504209|4.0|I often avoid reading this sort of book. Nothing says blockbuster-film-waiting-to-happen like a John Grisham-like thriller. It won't surprise me if a film version of this novel is in the works. However, praises and hype surrounding Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code are well deserved. This is an excellent, compelling, intelligent thriller -- one that grabs you and doesn't let go until its final page. Robert Langdon is called in for questioning regarding a violent murder at the Lourvre one night. The clues left by the victim, the museum's curator, send Langdon and the victim's granddaughter, Sophie, on a quest to solve both the murder and the various clues the curator has left. The story is smart and well-paced and it will keep you guessing. I also love all of the historical references to art. This is a memorable, thrilling read that lives up to its hype. Highly recommended...
B0000TB014|4.0|This is my second MJ DVD to own, my first purchase was History on Film II, and i loved that one. This one is a great addition to my collection! I especially love the long edition of You Rock My World. And any MJ fan would def. want to pick up this DVD, support MJ and get some of your favorite classic songs!!!!!!
B000002KO3|5.0|One of the best recordings of the period, this one actually appeared at the beginning of the decade.  Talking Heads had entranced listeners with their spare style and clever writing, so this funk-filled collaboration with Brian Eno came as something of a surprise.  <br />The recording is filled with catchy, danceable delights, including the classic &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Crosseyed and Painless.&quot;  The third track, &quot;The Great Curve&quot; could cause dance-floor meltdown with its huge vocal choruses and overlapping melodic lines.  And for what it's worth, as some have mentioned, the energy level seems to mellow out as the recording progresses, finishing with the trance-like &quot;Overload.&quot;<br />The remastered sound is just fine -- a tribute to how well the project was recorded to begin with.  Essential for Talking Heads fans, and possibly one of the top ten recordings of the Eighties.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina really shows her vocal and music boundrys on this cd, and as far as i'm concered, she passed. Xtina's first single was 'Dirrty', and if you liked that, then you'll love the whole album. I do hope that she brings out 'Impossible', as it's a song in which alot of people could relate to. The Voice within is a great song, and is beautifully written by Christina. This is in fact one of my favorite cds of her, and i have changed my feelings towards Xtinas music. Around june last year i was a little embarrased to buy her first debut album, but now i just buy everything by her! You go girl
B000002IGV|4.0|In the case of &quot;Twisted Sister&quot;, I'd take this album over their &quot;Best Of&quot; anyday. Only &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; includes &quot;Burn In Hell&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;, and &quot;S.M.F.&quot;. Of course it also includes &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot;, &quot;The Price&quot;, and their biggest hit &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot;. Plus, only with &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; do you get one of the best album covers of all time. They don't make 'em like that anymore. This is simply one of the great metal albums of the 1980's, with one of the hottest front-women ever.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been listening to DT for a few years and have bought their back catalogue.  A lot of people have rated this lower because it isn't as &quot;progressive&quot; as their former releases and that is true - it isn't.  BUT, it is what they made it to be - a straight ahead rocker with prog twists here and there.  <br />You can really see their Metallica influence shining through and most songs are straight up rock as only DT could write.  John Petrucci's solos are extremely fast and yet his playing doesn't slip into the cliched metal solo.  The solo on &quot;In the name of God&quot; is excellent and is amazing technically.  The songs are well written and, as with most progressive albums, become catchier with each listen.  <br />Give the album a chance and listen to it a few times; you won;t be disappointed.
B00008H2LB|1.0|When Meteora came out, I went crazy. I was obsessed with this album. Linkin Park finally gave us some completely new songs after what -3 years? But over time I realised the truth. What did we get? An album repetative in song style, with teen-anst driven, watered down lyrics, and increddibly simple instumentals (especially the guitar). It's the start of a great band just losing it. Hybrid Theory an HTEP were always and still are some of my favorite albums but Meteora was just sad. It's the start of a once awesome hard rock band going into the MTV-pop genre. And now releasing singles such as Numb and Breaking The Habit is only going to bring more young fans who share their love of Linkin Park alongside their other favorite band; N'Sync.
0385504209|5.0|Robert Langdon, an expert in religious symbology lecturing in Paris, doesn't exactly live a life of danger; he works the lecture circuit, writes scholarly books, and keeps his nose buried in ancient tomes. So it's something of a surprise when the police come banging down his hotel-room door. Jacques Sauniere, a curator at the Louvre, has been shot to death in one of the museum galleries; in his last moments, he used his own blood and a marking pen to arrange his body in a bizarre tableau, complete with a coded message. Langdon has ostensibly been called upon in a professional capacity to help solve the mystery. But Agent Sophie Neveu, a police cryptanalyst, reveals the truth: Sauniere's dying message included Langdon's name, and the police are about to wrongfully arrest him as the killer. Neveu believes in Langdon's innocence, and she has a special reason for wanting to find the real murderer: Sauniere was Neveu's estranged grandfather. On the run from the police, Neveu and Langdon follow a trail of puzzles and clues to find the truth behind Sauniere's murder, and the knowledge he died to protect - information that reaches back through the centuries to a secret society, an artistic genius, and a priceless historical artifact.<br />I've always liked books that invite the reader to solve puzzles along with the characters, and Code has them in spades: anagrams, numerical cyphers, riddles, and secret scripts (at one point, a character offhandedly comments that at least 62 other words can be made using the letters of the word PLANETS, and I had to stop reading and try it out for myself). The puzzles range in difficulty from Instantly Obvious to Unsolvable Without Being Fluent In Greek. There's also plenty of historical information, which is integrated smoothly into the prose; remarkably, even when inserted into dialogue, the explanatory asides don't interrupt the flow. Brown ensures that readers who are unfamiliar with religious iconography and cyphers have all the necessary information to fully enjoy the story, without leaving advanced readers feeling bored or patronized. Even if you know all this stuff already, the author's concise recaps are interesting and, as far as I can tell, well-researched and factually accurate.<br />Brown's writing is clean, precise, and detached, conveying information efficiently and minimizing its narrative presence in the story. The plot is appropriately full of twists and turns, with plenty of cliff-hanging action and a highly satisfying resolution, although some of the inventions seem a bit much (not only must there be a self-mutilating monk/assassin, but he must be an albino self-mutilating monk/assassin to boot). The character development is pretty much what you'd expect from an action-packed thriller - which is to say, minimal, unless it provides an excuse for more ass-kicking adventure. The focus is upon the ingenious puzzles-within-puzzles that Brown has devised, rather than the characters who try to solve them; for this type of story, that's not a problem, although it does limit the book to entertainment rather than literature.<br />A fast-paced, suspenseful, and surprisingly intelligent thriller, The Da Vinci Code deserves its good reputation. It's fascinating, action-packed, and it'll do more to stimulate your mind than an overpriced mocha at the Terminal B coffee cart. If you're ready to let your powers of deduction take flight, give this first-class airport book a try. Another great novel is THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez.ssary information to fully enjoy the story, without leaving advanced readers feeling bored or patronized.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I won't go all out and rant and rave about how this show was the best thing ever to hit the tube. But I will say that it was surely one of the most interesting shows in a while. Having followed Fox's genius idea of playing all the shows in a messed up order starting by the most suckiest, I really haven't seen em all. I most likely have seen about 3/4 of the episodes. And I must say that I was genuinely disapointed that this show wasn't given a fair chance. <br />I do like some science fictions, but not much. And this show to me had the nice balance of not being a geekfest, but having a nice sci fi feel to it none the less. The idea of a western in the future was a clever idea. And it didn't go into the whole alien crap like star trek, so it was a plus.<br />I'm also disapointed that we will not know what does happen to the crew of the serenity. The characters all had a lot of debt that could of been explored in the following seasons, and they were all interesting in there own way. What did happen to the doc's sister, how was there childhood, how did the preacher get all his fighting skills and knowledge? Stuff like that, could of been really elaborated. And the ideas for episodes countless. Maybe if the movie is sucessful it will actually be put back on the air, who knows.<br />So to me, it's a good dvd collection to have and I'm sure I will not be disapointed when I do get it in a few days.
038572179X|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read in years. It tells of a crime in 1935 and how the subsequent cover-up affected each member of a family. All of the characters in Atonement are richly described. No one is entirely good or evil. What is most captivating about the book is its perspective on whether you can ever really take back a mistake. In addition, you get a fantastic portrait of Britain during WWII. My one recommendation is that you do not read the jacket cover of the book before diving in. The jacket gives away a key plot point that you won't discover on your own until you are a third of the way through the book.
B000069CWE|5.0|Let me start of by saying that this CD is not for the excited die hard rock fan, like lets say a KoRn fan..<br />This cd is really REANIMATED. just as the name suggest. True Lp fans would have known that Lp is not the Average Rock Band. but goes thru alot of changes..hence my title metamorphosis..<br />This cd includes BONUS MULTI-MEDIA CONTENT. that's a plus. but now-a-days most cds come with that so...<br />Reanimation has 20 tracks...worth the money..compared to some rock cds that make you pay the same price for just 12 tracks. I'm not calling names *coughEvanescencecough*<br />This cd contains some tracks that were not on hybrid theory such as 'my december' but again is remixed. but not in a bad way.<br />The song 'my december' really shows the skill vocals of chester bennington and really impresses the first time listener.<br />All the tracks to me were great. I appreciated the fact that alot of hip-hop was put into it and remixed great and that i was not just re-purchasing hybrid theory<br />But ****WARNING****. if you despise hip-hop. don't purchase this cd.<br />but if you despise hip-hop then i don't know how you can call yourself an LP fan..but that's just you i guess<br />so all in all<br />the cd is awesome...great anime cartoon art. great production by the one and only MIKE SHINODA.<br />its a must have..
0030514924|5.0|This book not only taught me a lesson in life, it also made me feel great to have a great family that is very caring. The one lesson  this book taught me was to be nice to all people and be a good person. If you aren't ghosts will haunt you. Just kidding on that last sentance, but being a mean person will come back to get you in various ways.
0486266885|4.0|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde challenges the strict social classes of the Victorian era and explores the duality of human nature. Reputation is a prevalent theme in this horror story from a different generation. Readers are taken on an adventure through the eyes of Mr. Utterson as he tries to discover the connection between the prestigious Dr. Jekyll and the curious Mr. Hyde. <BR> <BR>Because of the language during the Victorian period, readers of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tend to be of a more mature audience.  The language used in the book is not hard to understand for the more advanced readers. The book appeals to many audiences because those who have not read it know the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Movies and other books have been based on this novella by Robert Louis Stevenson. Though people of different ages may want to read the book, it is best for more advanced readers. <br /> The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is appealing because of its many different objectives. For those who wish to learn of a different era, namely the Victorian period, this book is perfect. It shows the way reputation was exalted during that time. For those interested in horror stories, this book will appeal to them. If you are interested in the duality of human nature and other psychological type things, this book will interest you. For someone who just wants a good read this book is also a good choice. This book is a classic because of its appeal to many types of people. Even young children know the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Before reading the book, I knew the basic meaning behind it. <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone that has at least a high school reading level. For those younger, the books language may become a bit confusing and cause the overall story to be lost. The meanings behind the book may be hard to catch at the first glance. For those who wish to look deeper at the meaning of Stevenson's words, this book is perfect. Even if the reader doesn't want to read between the lines, the basic horror story in this book is entertaining enough.<br /> I would give this book a rating of 4 stars. It is interesting and informative. At times the book because a little boring because of the in depth information and the stiff language. There is little action in the book and the ending is a bit different than other books, but over all it is an interesting story and a good read.
0156027321|4.0|Will it change your life?  Will it make you believe in God?  I would answer probably not to both of those questions.  And although there is a blurb somewhere on the dust jacket that this book WILL make you believe in God, it's better to simply enjoy Life of Pi as a unique and funny book with some interesting comments on the human condition.  The first third of the book describes the young man's upbringing in India, his life as a zookeeper's son, and his introduction to---and confusion over---the different religious doctrines.  The next two-thirds of the book describes his ordeal when he is trapped on a lifeboat for seven months with only a tiger for company.  Both parts of the book are very enjoyable and well-written.  One reviewer said that the ending was disturbing, but it is also highly ambiguous---intentionally---and this reader may have been disturbed by something that didn't even really happen.  Take the book with a grain of salt and simply enjoy its stylish prose and offbeat humor, then look for the secrets of life elsewhere.
B00008H2LB|4.0|First and formost, we all know Linkin Park does it again time after time. But we cannot say that Meteora is the best CD. Meteora doesn't come close to Hyrbid Theory<br />Flaws &amp; reasons:<br />1) The cd (audio) is quite short compared to reanimation and Hyrbid theory ....but...one has to consider this : why waste 5 mins just repeting when you can pass the message thru the song in 2 mins tops...well that's how i saw it<br />2) The only song i found that sounded like the LP i knew from b4 meaning hybrid theory was &quot;faint&quot;....<BR>however, linkin park is known to change their style around just as we avid LP fans saw in reanimation<br />3) Track Number 12: &quot;session&quot; was not so impressive compared to mr'hahns old intrumental on hybrid theory<br />DVD<br />The Dvd was entertaining...showed backstage stuff like the making of some songs such as &quot;somewhere i belong&quot;.<BR>Advertised LPU on the DVD...for some strange reason..<br />But all in all , the combo is not so disappointing<br />when bought, the CD might seem reallys short, but that has its advantages. its short and to the point.  LP has also showed growth on this cd...this CD also focuses on 'wounds' for some reason. i guess that was the theme of meteora.<BR>but all in all...again<br />amazing..<br />Avid LP fans should purchase the CD if not the combo. but if you want a good laugha nd backstage pass. order the combo..
B0000CDLA7|4.0|If you've never listened to DT, this will open your eyes.  But there are better albums from DT to start with.  This might be a gradual transition if you are already into pretty heavy metal, parts of it sound very, very similar to metallica.  Entertaining, but not quite as amazing as other DT.
B00003CXBH|4.0|&quot;The Mission&quot; occurs during the colonial era in South America in a disputed area between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. The movie focuses on the terrible situation of the indigenous people of the area during this time period. <BR>   The movie follows two men, father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), and an ex-mercenary named Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro). Together the two of them are fighting to protect the missions of the region as well as the souls (and the bodies) of the indigenous people who reside in the missions. <BR>   The central problem of the movie is based on historical fact. At this time, the area is being disputed between Spain and Portugal. The kings of the two countries have decided that the region, which previously belonged to Spain, should now belong to Portugal. The problem comes in that when the land transfers to Portugal, the Portuguese will dissolve all of the missions and make the indians into slaves. However, in order for Portugal to legally own the land, the Catholic Church must o.k. the exchange. The objective of Father Gabriel and Mendoza, then, is to convince the church not to allow the exchange of land. <BR>   The two main characters are well portrayed by Irons and De Niro. The interaction between the two characters also adds an interesting element to their attempt to help the native people. De Niro's character Mendoza is a mercenary who captured and sold indians into slavery for the Portugese until he is convinced by Father Gabriel to help the very people he persecuted and become a Jesuit priest.<BR>   This is a very good movie. It shows the terrible status of the native people of the area during the colonial era quite convincingly. The movie brings into question the best way to protect and help the native people, not only during the time period of the movie, but for today as well. <BR>   The movie is also worth seeing for the incredible natural beauty of the sets. Much of the movie takes plaze above the famous waterfalls at Iguazuin Argentina. The thing I liked best about the movie was the incredible soundtrack, that featured haunting melodies, as well as actual choir music from the Baroque period, which is historically accurate to the time period.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This sequel is a prime example of why most sequels are so horribly bad; take a good, unique idea and make a movie out of it.  Then, if it makes money, make a second movie in which you repeat---and overdo---everything that made the first movie so good.  That's what happened with The Matrix.  First movie, good.  Unique.  Nice plot, good idea.  Interesting.  Second movie, nothing but special effects and a nonexistent plot that will appeal to nobody over the age of 12.  I actually chuckled when I saw one review that said &quot;I expected more special effects.&quot;  This film is nothing BUT special effects!  If you put together all the footage that featured no effects whatsoever, it might make up about five minutes of screen time.  The first film took a sci-fi plot and added an interesting philosphical slant.  This film, however, is about nothing but people who dress up in leather and sunglasses and then fight.  Anybody who says this film is deep and philosophical is either under 12 years of age or else has never read even one sentence of a real philosophy text.  Bottom line?  Two hours of eye candy, interesting to watch one time and then forget about it.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah is awesome once again. Just amazing lyrics and what a voice.  Those that gave Afterglow a low rating clearly have no appreciation for moving, beautiful music.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I'm really shocked, as I read through these reviews, at how many people are whining about anti-copying protection built into this album.  Hey everyone - there's nothing in the Constitution guaranteeing us a right to free music.  I loathe the RIAA and its tactics, but come on.  If your friends want the CD, then tell them to buy it.  Or tape it - remember cassettes?
0385504209|2.0|I found myself thinking of Umberto Eco's book, &quot;Foucaults's Pendulum&quot; as I read The DaVinci Code. The plot is certainly not original, but a variation of Eco's work, at least for me. I am a fan of Da Vinci, and checked out the story for that reason, but Eco had the main idea first.
0440180295|5.0|You may read this book and find it so funny and enjoyable that the underlying message will be missed.  Which is ok bacause the true sign of a classic is a book you can return to and pull something new from it.  That's the beauty of Slaughterhouse-five.  There's no timeline.  There's no strong characters.  There isn't a bad guy.  And the bombing of Dresden (which according to the author is the reason the book was written) lasts about a paragraph.  And in the middle of all of this chaos and nothingness, Vonnegut still gives the reader something grab hold of and savor...again and again. <br />If you haven't read this book, this one is a 'must read'.  Do yourself the favor.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|This set rejuvenated a love for this band that started some 20 years ago, yet had faded in recent years.  I'd heard several knocks that the crowd was too loud, but the hunger of the Brazilian fans for this band was so overwhelmingly electric, that I'm glad it was given a more prominent place in the mix.  It made me feel like I felt during my first Rush show back in '86.  <br />It's a great live set, a nearly exhaustive retrospective of an amazing career.  The &quot;Boys in Brazil&quot; documentary was quite interesting and well-executed, and the easter eggs were fun diversions, as well.  <br />Worth every cent, sez me.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|You can only hope that a band can get better after their first album, but when they don't, it can be very disappointing (see the 2nd releases from Puddle of Mudd, 3 Doors Down, etc.).  Nickleback's &quot;The Long Road&quot; kicks &quot;Silver Side Up's&quot; ass.  To put it plain and simple, its as good of straight ahead hard rock album we've seen in years.  Clean, hard, and in your face.  I love this album.  While not ground breaking (what is now a days, White Stripes?  The Vines? The Strokes?  PUHHHLEEEASE!), it's still excellent rock.  And I don't give a rats ass who thinks poorly of this band.  They rock today as good as any of the early 90's grunge bands... PROBABLY BETTER.
0385504209|1.0|With all the buzz about this book, I was looking forward to a good read.  The book starts quickly and definitely grabs the reader, but it's a quick spiral downward to a truly bad novel.  The writing is amateurish, the characters and their dialogue absurd and the coincidences simply beyond any credibility.  This is a truly bad book.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones<BR>By: Alice Sebold<br />The Lovely Bones works as an odd story as Susie Salmon has to understand and learn to let go of her life on earth as she now has a new life in heaven. She studies her family below her and watches as they try to figure out who has murdered her and how it happened. Her family disintegrates in their grief. Her father becomes determined to find her killer, her mother withdraws, her little brother Buckley attempts to make sense of the new hole in his family, and her younger sister Lindsey moves through the events of her teenage and young adult years with Susie backing her up.<br />Throughout her new home in heaven she realizes that her enemy Ruth whom she did not get along with while she is a live is falling in love with her first kiss. Susie recalls her sole kiss with a boy named Ray on Earth as &quot;like an accident--a beautiful gasoline rainbow.&quot; Susie is the narrator of this book telling the author about her life experiences that happened before her death and showing the events of her family and how they changed.<br />In this novel, Ruth Conors has high beliefs on telling us all about the dead and how they truly talk about us. She states that in the air between the living, spirits bob and weave and laugh with us. They are the oxygen we breathe.&quot; I enjoy this quote because it really gives out the true feelings of human beings. Although it's tough to loose a loved one, there's nothing wrong with having their spirits still with in us.<br />Unfortunately, Susie's family does not take her death as well as she does.  Susie's murderer Mr. Harvey is the perpetrator of many crimes and has been on the loose for years. He is in fact a serial killer, but has yet to be convicted of any of his wrongdoings, including Susie's death. Mr. Harvey is never caught, and her family never knows what happened to her. The other near missed takes place in an odd place when Susie switches places with Ruth and spends a few fleeting hours amongthe living. Instead of taking that opportunity to show Ray, her childhood flame, where her body is buried or spend her last time on earth with her family, she chooses to lose her virginity to Ray.<br />The more time she spends in her Heaven, the more it evolves just as she does, mentally and emotionally as she can not do physically. Susie soon realized that she couldn't enter into the &quot;real Heaven&quot; until she first let's go of her attachments on Earth. It is this journey that is the central focus of the novel and it ultimately holds the story together.<br />The theme of this book clearly shows that people are very different in understanding the loss of a loved one. Susie's family deals with the loss of her in many different ways. Her father doesn't want to believe that she's actually really gone and wants to know who's doing all of this. Her sister moves on and lives into her teenage years, her brother grows up not finding out till later that she's actually gone, and her mother has an affair with the investigation cop and ends up leaving her family behind.<br />The characters in this book fit perfectly. Susie is a hometown girl who doesn't know much but understands her death clearly better than anyone else. Her father enjoyed building bottled ships, and spending his time with Susie and much as he could.  Susie's mother gives all hope up on finding the person who murdered Susie, and her brother and sister move on with the child life not realizing what's actually going on.<br />In my own opinion I loved this book. I wanted to skip pages just to get to the end to see who killed Susie and if they ever find out who did it. Every day I wanted to read and learn more and more about how the life of losing some one really affects a family in real life.<br />If I had to rate this book I would give it a nine. The only flaw about this book is the fact about how it ends. I really thought that they would give out more details and a different ending but they didn't. I figured that maybe the family would get to grow stronger and discover Susie's death. I would strongly advise every one to read The Lovely Bones. It's a very good book and you can learn many things' about life.
B00003W8NM|5.0|A well written script, good direction, and fine performances from all three leads make this a great movie.  You need to watch it more than once to get a better understanding.
B000002B49|5.0|I had never even heard of Deep Forest until a woman I know in Kemerovo, Russian told me about them. Now I listen to this disc at least once a day since my purchase. To truely appreciate the genius of this work, turn down the lights and put the head phones on and get lost in a world of musical magic. I have thousands of music selections but it has been a long time since I have been captured by an entire collection of songs on one album. There simply isn't a bad song on the Boheme Disc!! If you don't like this disc you must be tone deaf. :-}
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Yeah, poor vocals. But she can definately sing. You should listen to her ballads and then announce that she can't sing. Especially the ones in her 1st album.<BR>Fortunately or Unfortunatley Britney's left behind the bubblegum pop with her first 3 albums. This one is very mature comparitively and seems to be attracting a lot of non-britney fans. I'm a big Britney fan and I was disappointed to hear that her new album would have a hip hop flavour. But I bought it anyway and trust me it grows on you fast. <BR>I can't get the CD out of the CD player (no, not because its stuck, becuase I dont want to). It's catchy and something to get in a sort of groove. Great background mixes and stuff. And the two ballads are great!<BR>Ok her voice is not upto Christina's level and the lyrics too but what I would suggest is get both the CDs (c'mon its Christmas season and time to spend some extra cash). After you listen to Christina's Stripped, you'll find a lot of stuff about life and her voice is loud. That's when you should listen to Britney's CD. Her voice and the lyrics set you loose and get you with the beat and her voice is softer than Christina's. <BR>You should get this CD with stripped not instead of stripped.<BR>It's really quite satisfactory and I would give all the songs 10/10 except Early morning - 9/10. Overall, it's a good CD and should be given a chance even if you hate Britney.
B000002G23|5.0|Unfortunately, many artists are only willing to put a handful of quality songs on an album.  The Police are among the notable exceptions.  Many of their lesser know songs are better than a most of what you hear on the radio today.  <br />This box set spans the band's much too brief career.  Okay, its not absolutely everything, but its good enough for 99.9% of Police fans.   From the early, angry young men days to the more mellow reggae and eventual pop stardom, it's all here.  <br />The box includes excellent photos and notes.  Get it and enjoy.
B0000630BT|5.0|To start i would like to say that this is truly one of the best albums i´ve heard.<BR>It has groundbreaking solos, non-stopping drumming, great bass and one of the best voices of metal.<BR>This album has CLASSIC written all over it.<BR>If you´re a metal fan, this album belongs in your collection.<BR>One more thing: Although the lyrics aren´t as good as Maiden I still find them very good, this are the kind of lyrics i would write if I had a heavy metal band. You´ll find yourself singing every single one.<BR>Now to the songs:<br />Painkiller: This one is very fast, and in the beggining we can hear the technique of the new-comer Scott Travis which is excellent. The lyrics and musicianship are great.<BR>The solos are brilliant and Rob sings in a strange style but it works very good.<BR>&quot;He is the Painkiller<BR>This is the Painkiller&quot;<BR>Hell Patrol: One of my personal favourites on the album.<BR>It has everything: stunning vocals, excellent interplay between K.K. and Glen, and powerful drumming.It´s a great slow burner.<BR>Check out the ending of the song when Rob screams and sings this: <BR>&quot;Crome Masters<BR>Steel Warriors<BR>Soul Stealers<BR>Ripping out hearts<BR>They're Devil Dogs<BR>The Hell Patrol&quot;<BR>All Guns Blazing: Although it has a great beggining:&quot;Twisting the strangle grip won't give no mercy,<BR>Feeling those tendons rip torn up and mean!&quot; it´s the weaker song in the album. It´s not bad. Simply it´s not that good.<BR>The chorus is a bit repetitive and doesn´t have great melody.<BR>Leather Rebel: This one is a killer. The chorus is powerful and the drumming is very fast in the bridge.<BR>&quot;Leather Rebel<BR>Lightning in the dark<BR>Leather Rebel<BR>With a burning heart&quot;<BR>Metal Meltdown: Another great song. The chorus on this song reminds me a bit of Halloween. It also reminds me a part on Offspring´s song beheaded.<BR>&quot;Here comes the Metal Meltdown<BR>Run for your lives<BR>Can't stop the Metal Meltdown<BR>No-one survives&quot;<BR>Night Crawler: This is probably my favourite in the whole album.<BR>Great melody, excellent solos and great lyrics. The spoken part by Rob Halford is simply brilliant. This could have been a song in a terror film. This one is truly a classic.<BR>&quot;Straight out of hell<BR>One of a kind<BR>Stalking his victim<BR>Don't look behind you<BR>Nightcrawler<BR>Beware the beast in black<BR>Nightcrawler<BR>You know he's coming back&quot;<BR>Between The Hammer &amp; The Anvil: This one has excellent verses, although the chorus isn´t that powerful.<BR>But it still remains a fantastic song.<BR>&quot;The burning sermons purge their evil words<BR>Between the Hammer and the Anvil&quot;<BR>A Touch Of Evil: this one is almost perfect.It has an absolute incredible chorus and great vocals.<BR>&quot;In the night<BR>Come to me<BR>You know I want your Touch of Evil<BR>In the night<BR>Please set me free<BR>I can't resist a Touch of Evil&quot;<BR>Battle Hymn: short instrumental.<BR>One Shot At Glory: Very good.A solid effort.<br />The Remasters Bonus Tracks:<BR>Living Bad Dreams: A great ballad. Just great.<BR>Leather Rebel (live): It could have been better performed especially the singing, but it´s a classic.
B00005JLD4|5.0|All should see this movie.  The story is shocking, emotional, and inspirational. Freedom and family are priceless.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a good CD and I think you should have it whether you are a Britney fan or not. I mean there are people here who have listened only to the samples or only a few songs who give it one-star reviews because they hate her. Please talk about her music not her! I know she's sort of poppy and sometimes tries to put on an image and also lip-synches but this is a review column not a Britney forum. Reviews about the CD are hard to find in here...<BR>This CD is great and music will get you in the beat so please buy it
B00009TB5G|5.0|If you are a fan of the books and hated this movie, you need to see this Extended Edition.  While I'm sure you can find more stuff to be mad about, the added scenes fix nearly all of my caveats about the movie as it was released to theaters.<br />The biggest thing they fixed was Faramir.  Instead of coming off as some lout who incomprehensibly lets the Ringbearer go in Osgiliath, you find him to be an intelligent, thoughtful man who is grieving for his beloved brother and trying to please a father who seems determined to hate him.  And it was a real pleasure to see Boromir (in a flashback) before the Ring started to eat at him.<br />The orc-cleaving contest between Gimli and Legolas becomes clearer.  There's more Frodo and Sam stuff.  You get to find out Aragorn's true age in an otherwise-uncomfortable scene.<br />The 4 audio tracks are a real joy also. From the writer/director's track, you learn that the movie did indeed suffer from middle-movie-itis; this is when everyone involved was suffering under the heaviest workloads.  You can tell that they're all cringing because they wanted to do it better... yet even what they did is so very good you want to comfort them.<br />My surprise favorite audio track this time was from the production and art people.  These are the folks who built and struck the sets every day, and who painted the backgrounds and made all the props and figured out how to light the sets.  They're the ones who made it all go!  And you can see that they loved this work enough to put in the hours and the labor and the true caring that makes it so wonderful to see.  Now, where can I find that elven furniture on EBay??<br />You'll have to look to another reviewer for the 2 supplimentary disks, I haven't seen them yet.  It will take you WEEKS to view everything on here.  I got the Collector's edition, and the documentary on the Gollum collectible was interesting, though it's also kind of a commercial for all the other collectible figures.  <br />I recommend you buy this DVD.  You won't have enough time if you just rent it!
B000002OZY|5.0|if you like concept albums, you'll enjoy this.  one of my all time favorite albums ever, highly reccomend it.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|The Diary Of Alicia Keys is definitely one of the greatest albums I've heard so far!  Ms Keys is back with a stunning sophomore effort which clearly tops her debut album 'Songs In A Minor'. Her classy way of combining R&B and soul is awesome. Just by listening to the opening intro Harlem's Nocturne can send chills down your spine! No kidding! Wonderful intro.    Soul is the strength of Ms Keys. Songs like the first single You Don't Know My Name, If I Ain't Got You, When You Really Love Someone and Diary are the stand out tracks. Other great sounding cuts include Karma, If I Was Your Woman, Wake Up and Slow Down. However, Heartburn (the weakest track) is a disappointment. This is the only track produced by Timbaland. In my opinion, the latter and Ms Keys just doesn't blend together. Nobody Not Really is a cool number which incoporates soul with jazz and it sounds great! I wonder why Streets Of New York (feat. Nas & Rakim) isn't included. I think its because this is the only track that has rappers and will smear the whole soul/R&B combination.    I'm sure those of you who heard the first single quickly fell in love with Alicia Keys' music. She is one of those rare talents that really shine. Go grab this album if you haven't cos its worth buying and I'm sure it will be one of your favourite albums. Winner of 3 Grammys (Best R&B Song - You Don't Know My Name, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance - If I Ain't Got You and Best R&B Album - The Diary Of Alicia Keys). Excluding the duet R&B performance with Usher. A must have! Nuff said.
B00006RU5B|5.0|First off, before  listening to Audioslave, I had never heard any songs from RATM or Soundgarden. And from what I hear Audioslave has some members from both bands. Well whatever they did it sure worked! I love Cornell's epithic voice. It is beautiful during Like a Stone and I am the Highway. Tom Morella's solid work shows up during Show Me How to Live. This is easily one of the best rock records so far this millenium and I hope these guys stick around for a long time.
B000002L42|3.0|Imagine all the whoops, yells, and yee-hays from Steely Dan fans everywhere when they heard in 1995 that Walter Becker &amp; Donald Fagen were putting out, at long last, a new Dan release. Now imagine all the groans from said fans when the new CD simply turned out to be a live album, not a brand-new studio offering (we would have to wait another five years until 2000's &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;). As it is, 1995's &quot;Alive In America&quot; is certainly a very good live set from Steely Dan, as Walt, Don, and their ace backup band deliver some very strong, faithful renditions of Steely Dan classics such as &quot;Green Earrings,&quot; &quot;Reelin' In The Years,&quot; &quot;Josie,&quot; &quot;Kid Charlemagne,&quot; and &quot;Aja.&quot; The performances ARE great. The problem is, the CD is too darn short. I saw Steely Dan on their '93 reunion tour, from which some of these live tracks come from, and, at only 67 minutes, with just 11 tracks, &quot;Alive In America&quot; only represents about half of the concert. You're totally left hungry for more. Had this live set been a double CD, with the *complete* concert on it, then it would've been something truly special. I sincerely hope that Walt &amp; Don will release a more expansive live set from their recent, outstanding &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; tour. Until then, &quot;Alive In America&quot; certainly makes for a nice little souvenir from Steely Dan's '93-'94 tours, but it could've been so much more.
6304711875|1.0|This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It starts off ok but after Drew Barrymore is killed it quickly goes downhill from there. 38 minutes into the movie I couldn't take any more &amp; turned it off. Don't waste your time on this garbage it's not worth renting.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Ok, I do not own any other UFO albums.  I grew up with AOR Rock, listening to DB, Bob Seger Robin Trower, Pink Floyd and too many others to mention. (Who the heck are UFO?)  I USED to believe Segers' \\"Live Bullet\\" was the ultimate live album, CD whatever.  But there is no \\"ultimate\\"<BR>live recordings.  Each must be taken in the proper context. <br />This CD knocked my socks off, and still does.  What happened here is the same thing that happened with Frampton, Seger and others.  A snapshot was taken during a career peak.  A musical picture of a group of guys that should not be doing anything else but what is laid down on these tracks.  UFO is captured here and the energy recorded and Schenkers' technical and musical ability is amazing.  What a kick-butt guitar player.  Do not buy this album unless you can turn it UP!!!!!  Regardless of who you are and what you listen to, if you like Rock and Roll Baby...start at track 4 and TURN IT UP AND LEAVE IT UP!!!!!!!!
0446677450|5.0|Actually, I wasn't too thrilled by this book at first and actually hated it. Seemed too flowery. Like make believe. Then I was introduced to a businessman in my community who amassed a net worth in excess of a million dollars in real estate and business in less than 2 years and he credited the technques and ideas taught by Kiyosaki for his wealth.<br />I went to work and in my first month made more money than my college professors make in a year.<br />What can I say---It WORKS. IT REALLY WORKS!
6304711875|1.0|This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It starts off well enough but after Drew Barrymore is killed it's all downhill from there. The acting &amp; script are so bad I had to stop the movie after 38 minutes. This is not worth renting much less buying, if I could give it less than one star I would.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Not bad for this group.  &quot;Affirmation&quot; is something for us to believe.  Here's how I rate each track:<br />01 Affirmation.  #1 track of the album. Reminds me of &quot;Top Gun&quot; and wanna dance. 10/10<br />02 Hold Me. That song sounds too romantic, but it's alright. 8/10<br />03 I Knew I Loved You.  The best teen romantic song, but better than &quot;Hold Me.&quot; 9/10<br />04 The Best Thing.  Reminds me of travelling through daytime New York City. 9/10<br />05 Crash And Burn. Sounds like I've been travelling through fire or through sunset Los Angeles. 9/10<br />06 Chained To You. It's like driving in a sports car through any city. 9/10<br />07 The Animal Song. It's like flying through a jungle, but the song takes place flying through the city buildings. 9/10<br />08 The Lover After Me. Just like &quot;Hold Me&quot;, it's also too romantic.  But it should be the final release on the radio station of this album. 9/10<br />09 Two Beds And A Coffee Machine. Too sad to listen, but its alright to relax. 8/10<br />10 You Can Still Be Free.  Reminds me of Sarah Brightman's versions because it sounds like a pure mood atmosphere. 9/10<br />11 Gunning Down Romance. The longest track over 5 minutes.  There is a gigantic fire warfare going on in a deserted area for this song. 9/10<br />12 I Don't Know You Anymore. Like &quot;Two Beds And A Coffee Machine&quot;, it's another sad song to conclude this album. 8/10
0790729970|5.0|not one of Jim Carrey's best, that would be his Ace Ventura movies and Liar Liar. But it's good nonetheless, oh and by the way, Cameron Diaz looks freekin' sexy in this movie!! Ok, she always has in every movie, but ESPECIALLY in this one...mmm...Cameron...tasty...*drools*...
B00005JKCH|5.0|...this was a revelation! Too many comic characters just don't translate well, if at all, to the big screen, but Spidey isn't one of them. Not in this version, anyway. I was talked into going to see it by my best friend, as I wasn't interested at first...and I am SO glad she did!<BR>&quot;In spite of all you've done for them, eventually they will hate you!&quot;...truer words were never spoken. What makes both the original comic and this film so poignant is that this wisdom comes from the VILLAIN. And he's right. The articles in the Bugle are as negative as they are favourable: 'yes, he saved those people...but who put them in danger in the first place?', and the reader (or the audience) can't possibly miss the implication.<BR>Driven by tragedy, first losing his parents, then his beloved uncle (at the hands of a petty thief he, Peter, allowed to escape), eventually coming to hate his powers and the responsibility they force upon him, Spider-Man was and is the most enduring of the Marvel characters because he's not just a hero...he's a very human hero. Flawed, imperfect, always concerned about the consequences of his actions - even in the face of events that seem to spiral out of his control, a theme that never let up in the comic. This made him stand out from all the other Marvel characters, and is the reason he's such an enduring one, especially as he learned the fundamental truth of being a superhero - &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot; - the hard way. Would that today's world leaders understood that as well as Spider-Man does.<BR>I was most impressed as to how closely the plot followed the original storyline, but updated it for a modern audience. The final confrontation with the Goblin, in particular, was spot-on, even to the Goblin discovering Spider-Man's true identity and vice versa, being hoist on his own petard, his last, sane words spoken by Norman and not the Goblin: &quot;Peter...don't tell Harry...&quot;<BR>Casting was superb - especially J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson! I swear, he was BORN to play that role! He couldn't have been closer if they'd scanned him from the comic and used that to create a 3D computer model of him! Tobey - spot-on geek-turned-superhero. Kirsten - rrrowwwwllll! Red hair SO works on her! Willem - Norman and the Goblin both played to perfection.<BR>The DVD itself was superb, with plenty of extras. Well worth the money.<BR>I hear the sequel's been made. I can't wait! Roll on Spider-Man 2!
1586210661|5.0|I listened to this book on tape, read by the author.  I really enjoyed his humor.  Sedaris makes observations about his life and laughs at himself and his family.  He doesn't take anything too seriously and is usually the subject of his own jokes.<br />It was a treat listening to him, because he does accents and imitations quite well, but I think this book would be just as funny if I had read it.<br />A good portion of the book focuses on his time in France.  His tales of trying to learn and speak French are too funny.<br />It is hard to explain why this book is so funny, but it definitely is.
0790731002|5.0|Riddle me this, Riddle me that, whay should you buy a movie about a big black bat?  Well, this is why I think you should buy, listen to me if you try.  The Batman series is a good thrill but Batman Forever will give you a great fill.  Better put on some traction, because this movie has wall to wall action.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Actually, Ive never really liked Britneys music. The first two albums can be define as crapp pop. Later with her third album she improved the quality of her music and I think that \\"In the zone\\" definitly puts her out there as an artsit, and a pretty good one. I take a chance buying this album and I dont regret it for one second. I dont know if it is because of her or the people that worked with her, but he final product is exelent. She doesnt have a great voice but she really does know how to sing. Its a sensual,sexy and prococative album that really moves you, maby not in a sentimental way but definitly moves you in a sexual way and she deserve all the credit for that.I can believe Im saying this but I recomend this Britneys album 100%.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Well I finished all of my collection guys and am extremely pleased. Especially with the extended version of 3 which actually adds to the overall story and makes it much better. Four was better as presented at the theaters in my  opinon.<br /> In regards to packaging Although I really dont mind the unfolding to much afterall how many times are you going to view the films in a year but I do see a problem in the hubs. If even looked at the wrong way the discs come loose. To the serious collector this can be a problem with such a fabulous collection. But the set is done and leaves the obvious flaw for us to get clever with. So its not the product but the quality of the trays that hold the product that is the real bummer. Especially when moving or transporting them around. A more secure hub is needed such as the ones found in the regular keepsake cases. I do love my set though.<br />  In regards to the story, to my horror I finally realized that the reason it skewed to begin with was really Sigourneys fault as pointed out in one of the actress s' interviews, although I worship the ground she walks on:) It was really due to her conditions on coming back to the story that made the producers change the overall concept. She informed them that she would only do 3 if her character could die...she simply said she was just tired of the character. Its no wonder they needed to kill off the various characters in 3. So actually the actress was the one that really changed the whole story by her &quot;Do it or I wont come back&quot; conditions. Woe imagine the producers having to drastically alter the flow of the story to get their main draw to come back.<br /> If she would have lived in 3 then all of the other characters could have continued from 2. It would be safe to say that the script would have been completely different. The overall attitude of the fans would have also been greatly different. 4 would have not needed to be a resurrection but an ongoing story. I personally feel that the whole mistake was having to kill her off and that as I stated already was due to her own conditions on continuing the character. The bottom line is ......Sigourney made the boo boo not the producers writers or directors. But then again if they hadnt altered the story then their main draw would have not come back.  Hmmmat the whole mistake was having to kill her off and that as I stated already was due to her own conditions on continuing the character.

B0000CEB4V|4.0|Remembering these tunes that George contributed... lest we forget where they came from...needed doing.  This does it really well.  Clapton did a fine, fine job selecting, directing the music and playing, as do all of the musicians.  Many fine performances.  Billy Preston is exceptional and even Ringo does two numbers that make you smile.  This concert starts out with just enough sitar to remind (Norah Jones' half-sister and her pop Ravi) and gives us a view of George's varied interests and several musical lives beyond &quot;The Beatles&quot; days.  Disc 1 (full concert) has the feel of a filmed version, not as crisp and DVD-sharp as I expected, but the musical sounds and moods overpower this.  A good couple of hours.  Worth it.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|It sounds like a fifties-style stock plot: stranded in a strange land whose culture baffles the hell out of them, two lost American souls find solace in each other. Their respective spouses don't understand them-natch-and the foreign world around them has better things to do than to coddle their poor alienated selves.<br />But writer and director Sofia Coppola's story goes wonderfully right.<br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray at his leathery best) is a middle-aged actor, lodged at a luxury hotel in Tokyo for a week to shoot commercials (make a trip to japander.com and see if your favorite actors have done the same). Drowning his insomnia and his cultural befuddlement at the hotel bar, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson), a woman so young you can practically feel the peach fuzz on her smooth cheeks. While Bob is jaded at best with his dutiful calls to wife and kids and his nightly whiskey binges, Charlotte is downright unhappy. Spending day after day alone in a luxury suite while her photog hubby John (Giovanni Ribisi) is out shooting rock bands, she is as mystified by her marriage as by the Japanese.<br />The way Bob and Charlotte's tender relationship unfolds is easily one of the most thoughtfully crafted and believable love stories that has flickered across the screen in years. Told in beautifully understated tones, it has the viewer wondering at every turn where this romance can or should rightly go. In the end, we find that the characters knew the answer all along, and it is their ultimate sagacity that allows us to relate to the bittersweet story from start to finish: there is no disbelief to suspend.<br />Still, the movie is not entirely free of problems. No one is going to dispute that modern Japanese pop culture is a riot-Tokyo is William Gibson's muse for good reasons-and it's OK to say so. But as Murray's typically wry comments (verbally and otherwise) on the seeming madness surrounding the foreign traveler pile up, the unpleasant image of the smug American looking down on the rest of the world may take shape in some viewers' eyes. I've heard it argued that it really isn't unjustified to shake one's head at Japanese idiosyncrasies. But the fact that we're even talking about this mars what could otherwise have been an utterly enchanting picture.g down on the rest of the world may take shape in some viewers' eyes.

B00006J3T4|5.0|It's an exceptional collection and really like nothing else.  The talent drips off of this with every tune and begs to be played over again.  Folksy, ethnic, smooooth, sensual and fun.
B00007JVBI|3.0|Chan Marshall's live performances, which frequently entail such events as Marshall (Cat Power to her friends) breaking down in tears and running offstage after two minutes, are the stuff of indie legend, but she's most famous for her voice, a parched Southern drawl that has seen everything and speaks only of the dustiest roads and most lonesome, Faulknerian counties. Unfortunately, when it comes to actual music, Marshall doesn't really know how to play anything all that well. Thus, she writes a lot of one- and two-note songs. Fans of low-fidelity, technically incompetent albums will rejoice, but the rest of us might have a hard time getting past that.<br />But actually, for all its primitivism, the music isn't all that bad. The real problem is that Marshall is a really erratic songwriter. On one hand, \\"I Don't Blame You\\" is a perfect, emotionally complex song, addressed to some nameless angry musician (probably Marshall herself). On the other hand, there's \\"Maybe Not,\\" which explains to us that \\"we can _all_ be free...maybe not in words, maybe not in look, but with your mind.\\" Oh, come on, does she even believe that? Other times, the songs just don't make sense - \\"Fool\\" is supposedly a rumination on the American lifestyle, but is too oblique for one to get any real insight out of it. When the music is as simple as it is, and the focus is on the singing and lyrics, this sort of thing can be a problem. And then there's \\"Names,\\" an extremely, uh, _direct_ narrative about the various mishaps that befell Chan's childhood friends, all involving sexual abuse. On first listen, it's a petrifying tale. Afterwards, the very artlessness and uniformity of the stories kind of lead one to doubt them, mean as that might be. Still, real or not, it certainly gets one's attention.<br />One great talent of Marshall's is interpretation of other people's songs. Once someone else takes care of the words and music, it's all down to Marshall's quite powerful voice. The result is the spookynight-time picture of \\"Werewolf\\" and the bleak, rainy steppe of \\"Keep on Runnin',\\" where the cheeriest sentiment is \\"Goin' to keep on crawlin' till the day I die.\\" These are the best songs on the album. Marshall has a history of doing this to songs, having even released a whole album comprised only of covers, and it works every time. In fact, one might think that Marshall would be best off recording only covers. Why not? After all, music has a rich tradition of great, renowned singers who didn't write any of the songs they sang, and I don't mean to include boy bands in that.<br />As is stands, though, You Are Free is a really inconsistent record, though it shows all of Cat Power's highs and lows. In that regard, it might be her definitive album. Basically, it's really good when it sticks to wasted acoustic guitar, piano, and withdrawn depression. Deviations from this, excepting the unbelievably catchy \\"Speak For Me,\\" generally stumble, despite Dave Grohl's presence on drums. (Eddie Vedder appears here and there, too, but he's barely audible.) Whenever any attempt is made to bring the music to the foreground, its ineptitude becomes obvious. I like Cat Power, and I really like Marshall's voice; furthermore, I think that this album contains a number of genuinely very good songs. Even so, I can't blind myself to its faults.
B00001OH7V|5.0|David Bowie's catalogue is very diverse in terms of styles and personas he's adopted over the years.  Most people familiar with his work are likely to name 'Ziggy Stardust,' 'Station To Station' or even 'Let's Dance' as milestone albums.  But when someone mentions \\"Heroes,\\" one immediately thinks of the monolithic title track, which to this day retains a place in David's live shows.  In my opinion, 'Heroes,' the album, has always been rather overlooked; the spotlight being stolen by it's sister, 'Low.'  And while 'Low' is most definitely a masterpiece, 'Heroes' is an excellent work in it's own right and deserves re-evaluation.<br />'Heroes' takes the listener away to an alternative world filled with chaos (\\"Beauty and the Beast\\"), desperation (\\"Blackout\\"), nostalgia (\\"Sons of the Silent Age\\") and humor (\\"Secret Life of Arabia\\").  David's voice hits startling new heights here, and he's singing as though his life depended on it.  The ambient instrumental tracks range from murky (\\"Sense of Doubt\\") to soothing (\\"Moss Garden\\") to horrific (\\"Neukoln\\").  <br />I find it almost a cathartic experience listening to 'Heroes,' for it's as if David is purging all these raw emotions out of his system and trying to make the best of a difficult situation (relevant to his circumstances during the time the album was recorded).  Depending on my mood, it's not uncommon that I feel either drained or refreshed after listening to the album in one sitting.  <br />'Heroes' evokes a whole gamut of feelings, and is a most provocative listening experience.  It's a wild runaway-train of an album, by an artist who was always far ahead of his time.  Highly recommended to all DB fans (new or old) or anyone who likes music that takes you on an adventure.
B000001DYY|5.0|This is by far the best Tears For Fears album ever made, it's darker and edgier than their previous (jamming)fluff of the 80's. &quot;Elemental&quot; is musically, lyrically, meaningfully, sonically superior  to almost anything the bowel of the 90's polluted us with. It's a shame most people don't like to be challenged a little musically.  Boring, woe is me, all sound the same grunge knocked this brilliant   gem off the airwaves along with (I.Q. of 70 degrees on a warm day) rap. This CD jams! every song! what more could you possibly want?
B00005JMCW|5.0|Wow!  We loved this movie.  This actually happened to us once, but that jolt thing worked so we didn't have to learn any life lessons from the ordeal.  But seriously folks, this movie was absolutely one of our favorites.   We laughted, we cried, life doesn't get much better than that!  The soundtrack is also way cool.<BR>We also really like the Cheetah Girls and that soundtrack.  I think we've seen it every time it's been on the Disney Channel.  I hope we don't start watching Freaky Friday while the Cheetah Girls is on.  Horror!
B00003CXC7|5.0|I love Hitchcock, and his infatuation with Grace Kelly is contagious. He makes you realize what he saw in her that so fascinated him. I always thought she was an especially gifted, classy and beautiful actress and I always had a soft spot for James Stewart. The way these three come together in Rear Window is truly magical. It's one of those movies one can watch over and over throughout the years and never get tired of. It's a movie you grow old with, like a beloved spouse.<br />It's great entertainment, but the questions that are posed by it are eternal, like the meaning of privacy for instance, more valid than ever at this age of big brother and paparazzi; or how you can love someone with all your heart who doesn't fit in your universe and your way of life. Stewart's argument with the nurse (amazingly played by Thelma Ritter in what may very well be the role of her career) upon that very subject is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen on film. The movie would be worth it for that alone.<br />He proves the world over and over again that, just like his movies tend to be about bringing two lovers together and how that is achieved is ultimately unimportant, the eroticism between them is not about how much skin or graphic sex you're shown. Any frame in Rear Window is hotter than everything else you'll ever see in the movies put together. No one can be as erotic or as romantic as him.
B000075BFK|2.0|Look, I'm not one of those idiots that comes on the internet and mocks legends like 2pac, but to be honest I was disappointed with this album. I'm a huge fan of 2pac but this album just didn't feel like the other 2pac albums. I was disappointed with it and don't think it is worth the money. I gave it 2 stars because I might listen to cd 1 the odd time but I never listen to cd 2. So I'm gonna get straight to the point, you WILL be disappointed if u buy this album, even if u are a 2pac fan. I'm just giving my opinion and I hoped I helped.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|this is a great movie but im a fraid to say.....it gets my lowest score...4 stars out of 5. other than that it's a good movie it has great action and fighting scenes
0316666343|4.0|I had read several good reviews of this one, so I decided to read it for myself. Sebold, a rape survivor herself, tells the story of 14 year old Susie watching from heaven as her family tries to come to grips with her rape and murder. It was a beautiful, disturbing and memorable book. Her idea of heaven doesn't correspond with mine, but that's a minor point. The book was well-written--she goes back and forth in time with memories and yet it flows smoothly. If you think you can handle it, you should read this haunting novel.
B000005JPU|5.0|This is the greatest album by WASP... anyone really familiar with their history knows this.  Personal, deep, beautiful, heartwrenching, melodic, catchy, rocking, heavy... TIMELESS.  What else can I say?  Chances are, when you listen to this album, you just might see a bit of your own personality in it -- I know I did.  And, hey, isn't that what makes music great in the first place?
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Many reviewers have written that it took them about a second time through to get the 'jist' of Afterglow.  Sure, some songs will not capture your attention right away, but great art always takes time to be recognized.  Like many forms of art. Artists become much more successful when they have deceased, and when they are gone, it's too late to grant them with such gratitude.  People should not dismiss Afterglow so readily and easily. When VH1.com let the audience preview all Sarah McLachan's I was biased that all the songs were a bit mellow, but still, that did not keep me from purchasing Afterglow.  I'm very happy with Afterglow and the material is extremely well done: lyrical content, music compositions, and the performance.<br />1.Fallen (3:47): is definitely my favorite piece.  The piano and the cello greatly accompany the guitar within this piece.  And as what Sarah had said, the percussion took months to figure, and definitely the percussion empowers this piece with dramatic pose.  This song is about having faltered and the emotional attainment that comes with it. \\"Truth be told, I've tried my best, but somewhere along the way I got caught up in all there was to offer\\"<BR>rating: (6/5) and is GRAMMY NOMINATED<br />2.World on Fire (4:22): is a very haunting piece.  I must admit, this piece took several times to listen to before I had liked it.  The lyrics are great, that deals with isolation as the world within her eyes break down.  The background vocals, which are done by Sarah McLachlan, are perfect as they create a nice texture of tonality.<BR> \\"Stay close to me while the sky is falling. I don't wanna be left alone don't wanna be alone.\\"<BR>(4.5/5)<br />3.Stupid (3:23): is my second piece within the song.  The introduction of the musical content is quite opposite of the entire piece.  Stupid is the edgiest song within this CD.  The instrumentation is very intelligent.  The lyrics are very catchy, dealing with love and how it had made her a fool. \\"How stupid could I be? A simpleton could see...\\"<BR>(5/5)<br />4.Drifting (3:23): The instrumentation and lyrical melodic structure within this song is weak.  It is very simple and simply supports Sarah.  This song is basically about a person who has been \\"drifting\\" and those closest to this person wants them back. \\" I know you don't want to come down...waiting for you, please come home, please come home.\\"<BR>(3.5/5)<br />5.Train Wreck (4:36): One of my other favorite tracks.  This song is one of the few tracks that easily caught my attention on my first listen to Afterglow.  The lyrics are great, as well as the instrumentation.  I really enjoy the piano accompaniment with this piece.  The lyrical melodic structure is great and easy to remember.  \\"Your eyes like midnight fireflies light up the trenches where my heart lies\\".<BR>(5/5)<br />6.Push (3:55): is a piece mainly about love.  This piece was most definitely written for Ash Sood, her husband.  The music within this piece is weak.  The lyrics are good, but the melodic structure is not that appealing.  \\"You're the one true thing I know I can believe in\\"<BR>(3/5)<br />7.Answer (3:56): is another song that took a while to like. I initially did not like this song, but after reading many reviews who liked this song, I listened to this track again and found much likeness to this piece.  This piece reminds me of Angel, except the lyrics is much more different.  This song is very soothing to the soul. \\"Cast me gently, into morning, for the night has been unkind\\".<BR>(4/5)<br />8.Time (4:07): I very much enjoy this piece.  It is very much similar to some of her past pieces.  The instrumentation of this piece is good.  The lyrics and haunting vocals are superb in this piece.  This song is basically about time and how people need their space. \\"I need just a little more silence. I need just a little more time.\\"<BR>(5/5)<br />9.Perfect Girl (4:43): the lyrics and the melodic structure of this song is what <BR>initially caught me.  SarahMcLachlan has always been a great artist as to intertwine past music into her pieces, such as the introduction of this song contains what is similar to psalmody. \\"I own my insecurities, I try to own my destiny, that I can make or break if I choose\\".<BR>(5/5)<br />10.Dirty Little Secret (3:54): one of the other songs that has easily caught my attention.  The music within this piece is very subtle, but only needed to support the story that is unraveled by McLachlan's vocals.  This piece is very intimate, singer and music that is. This song is about a person who experiences much trash talking.  \\"I'm so tired of this town where every tongue is wagging, when every back is turned\\".<BR>(5/5)<br />A great fan of Sarah Mclachlan's ever since I was in the seventh grade, now currently a freshmen in college at UC Davis, I am still captured by the great inspiring music of hers.  The lyrical content is very intelligent as it has always been.  The music though, I have noticed to have changed.  I am happy with this change because it showcases another side of Sarah McLachlan.  As a music listener, I dislike music of artists who cannot be versatile within their music, always focusing on the same genre (like Britney Spears).  Over the past year, I have seen great changes within music artists who have created a great catalyst to show their different range of talent such as Jewel and Christina Aguilera.  Now, back to Sarah McLachlan, this is overall a great CD for avid fans of hers.  First time listeners, I would recommend Surfacing and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.  To end with a great note, Sarah McLachlan's \\"Fallen\\" has been recognized by the Grammy academy and has been nominated for Best Female Pop Performance.  This 3 time Grammy Winner, multi-platinum artist has done it again!
B000002UAF|5.0|The is the best Beatles album. Period.
B000089RVX|5.0|I got this CD specifically for the Bring me to Life song.  After reading the reviews I was doubting I would like it after that.  However, I find the reviews absolutely mind boggling.  I saw mention several times that there were only 2 good songs on the CD.  I love at least 6 of the song and the rest I am on the fence about.  The ones I already love are Bring Me to Life, My Immortal, Tourniquet, My Last Breath, Taking over me and Hello.  The words are moving and with the rock/alternative edge to them they only made me enjoy them more.  I have bought 2 copies of the CD simply because I want one for the house and another for the car changer.  For well thought out verses I think this is a great CD.  It's one of the best I have bought in quite a while.
B000089RV6|5.0|Back in Black is the last great studio album these guys put out.  Overall, I prefer the peak Bon-years (for me: Dirty Deeds, Let There Be Rock and Powerage), but this album is a classic.  As I've mentioned in another review, Brian sings like a supercharged John Fogerty, and there just seems to be magic in the studio.  Angus and Malcolm's guitar interplay during the mid-section of &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; is just incredible (Phil is also superb here).    I think this is far above the other Mutt Lange productions, including Highway to Hell (which is a fall from Powerage).
B000002BSG|5.0|I can't see many people disliking this album, I for one love it. It's one of the best records i've got in a while 5/5 ! It didn't sell bucketloads for no reason.<BR> <BR> Almost every song is good or very good if there's any Jamiroquai song you really like you will almost defenitly enjoy this album.<BR> <BR> Standout SONGS? - &quot;High Times&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot; and &quot;Alright&quot;
B000002UAX|2.0|Overrated.  WAY overrated.   I'll take A Hard Day's Night, any day!
B0000DD7NL|2.0|For those who are previous fans of Ms. Keys and potential buyers: please borrow the CD from a friend or listen to samples online before buying.  The CD got a great review in People magazine, and I rushed to buy it just to find out that it was an &quot;average&quot; work of art.  Even a touch below average.  She may have succeeded in not making a total sophomore slump, but definitely not worth my dinero.  Check it out before buying!
B000002UJQ|5.0|The first couple times I listened to this CD I wasn't as taken with it as I had been with theeir previous album The Bends.  It grew on me very quickly though and has since become my favourite album of the 90s.  At one point the band considered releasing videos for each song on the album (a plan that ended when they were unhappy with the never released Let Down video) and the idea isn't as crazy as it sounds.  With the exception of the spoken word track &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; all of the tracks on the album really are top notch.  My personal favourites are Karma Police, Paranoid Android, Climbing up the Walls and Lucky.  This album is definitely a grower.
0862641438|4.0|In this book, a small boy sets aside his friends' doubts in Santa Claus.  That night, a special train comes to pick him up.  The train travels through the forest and around the world, picking up other lucky children.  The train finally arrives at the North Pole where Santa is waiting to give the children gifts.  Later, the boy returns home with his magical gift from Santa.  This book is quite engaging, it although it may not be appropriate for children who have never been exposed to the idea that Santa does not exist.  The book contains approximately 1000 words.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I was a fan of the Strokes first album Is This It and the first time I heard this album I found it a little samey, but it really grew on me with repeated listens.  Many of the songs sound more aggressive than the songs on the debut.  There is also a little more variety than the debut.  &quot;What Ever Happened&quot; and &quot;Reptilia&quot; are both great rockers.  &quot;12:41&quot; and &quot;The End Has No End&quot; are both catchy pop songs with new wave hooks.  My favourite song on the disc, &quot;Under Control&quot; sounds like an old Motown song.  If you liked the first one but aren't as taken with this one on initial listen give it a few more spins...I'm pretty sure it will grow on you.
B000001FB3|4.0|Rainbow fans are rarely neutral about this album.  Some say it provides a different-but-good bridge from the incomparable Dio years to the Americanised Joe Lynn Turner years.<br />Count me among the former.  Yes, it IS different.  It's not &quot;Rainbow Rising&quot; or &quot;Long Live Rock 'N Roll&quot;.  It IS a bit more commercial (in fact, the one star knocked off is for the terrible hit single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; - but Rainbow didn't write that anyway).  Yes, Graham Bonnett's voice is an acquired taste (suited me just fine with the Michael Schenker Group, too).<br />But there is strong music here.  &quot;Eyes Of The World&quot; is more like older Rainbow than anything else on the disc.  The songs are more concise, and though Ritchie displays less of his amazing solo wizardry, he still does quite well within the song styles here (even sounding a little like Tony Iommi on &quot;Love's No Friend&quot;).  <br />And, of course, there is the incomparable Cozy Powell.  No-one, for my money, has ever topped this British skinbasher (it's odd that Rainbow were generally thought of as a British band, though they never had an all-UK lineup - well, this album lineup comes close since Aussie Graham Bonnett comes from a British Commonwealth country!) and he provides his always rock-solid, no-frills pounding here.  Rest in peace, Cozy.<br />Get this album, plus anything with Dio on it, and that will be all the Rainbow you really need, though there are good tracks here and there on the Joe Lynn Turner albums.
0385504209|1.0|This book came HIGHLY recommended and that's the only reason I read it all the way through.  Otherwise I would've stopped at least half way.  To each their own, but I personally found it a waste of time.
B00005JM02|4.0|The movie is about finding Marlin's son, Nemo, who has been captured and put into a dentist's fishtank in Sydney, Australia.  BUT THE MOVIE IS REALLY ABOUT FINDING MARLIN (voiced by Albert Brooks), the father, a well-meaning but suffocating father who doesn't want his partly disabled son to do anything risky.  In order to save Nemo, Marlin overcomes his fears of life off the reef, facing sharks, whales, and other ocean dangers in order to rescue Nemo.<br />That Marlin is the one who is really rescued is attested by his bravery at the end in letting Nemo, with whom he has been reunited, risk his life to save their new friend, Dory (voiced by Ellen Degeneres).  FINDING NEMO IS AN ENDEARING FATHER-SON STORY ABOUT THE STRUGGLES OF A PARENT TO LET GO AND THE INCREASED INTIMACY THAT RESULTS FROM DOING SO.<br />PLUSES:<br />* Pixar has outdone itself.  The incredible animation makes the Toy Story movies look like Steamboat Willie.<br />* Just as with the Toy Story movies, the pacing of the story is great.  There aren't any dead spots.  Both the comedy and the drama are perfectly placed.<br />PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION:<br />I personally still think the Lion King is the best animated feature Disney has ever put out.  But that's because of the power of the story.  This is the best animation Disney has ever put out, thanks to its partnership with Pixar.<br />I highly recommend it, but with the caution that THERE MAY BE SOME FRIGHTENING PARTS FOR YOUNGER VIEWERS, though my four-year old (who was frightened by Monsters, Inc., wasn't frightened by this.)

Its masts were still strong and intact but the sails were ripped and loose in the wind.  \\"Aarrg!\\" said Captain Jagger of the pirate ship \\"Rolling Stones\\", sending that wench, Yoko, nearly done the trick!\\"  Indeed, Captain Mick had long wanted to rule the seas for himself but Britain's pride, The Beatles, beat the pirate at every turn.  Then the Stones quietly slipped the avant-garde female on board their rival.  For good measure, they sneaked a female photographer on the H.M.S. Beatles as well.<br />Against all the rules of the sea, Lennon took Yoko into his berth and McCartney bonded with Ms. Eastman.  Tempers flew.  Various crewmembers walked out.  Bad days were had.  The result was a badly damaged ship.  The Beatles had almost run aground.

B0000DZTIW|5.0|I bought this soundtrack on the same day that I bought the Return of the King soundtrack and have been listening to both. Call me a bit biased, but Hans Zimmer's music has been something that I have grown up with and the Last Samurai Album packs an emotional wallop. The soundtrack is emotional and moody with tons of atmosphere. True, there are shades of Black Rain, which was also by Hans, but this album stands on its own, with just enough familiarity combined with the new. From Black Rain to A World Apart, to Rain Man, to the Lion King, to Gladiator, to The Last Samurai...Hans Zimmer packs an emotional punch with another soundtrack for our lives. After all...a sign of a good soundtrack is one that can be listened to without referencing the movie. Some soundtracks work that way....and some fall apart without the movie visuals....The Last Samurai has music that can stand apart from the movie....and touch your soul.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the best CD I've bought this year, and that's a lot. Such great songs, such catchy lyrics and music you can't help but love it. My favorite songs are &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;Everbody's Fool,&quot; &quot;Haunted,&quot; &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; and &quot;My last Breath.&quot; I urge you to buy this CD... you won't be sorry.

0375414053|3.0|The book is quick witted and the author can turn a phrase - the kind that makes you enjoy language and this is worth reading - addresses issues people pretend aren't there - i enjoyed it simply for the author's writing but the main character K8 - was not very likable - was very unhappy and really rude to her nice husband -she didn't seem to like any women either - except the crude crass type that are the female equivalent of the males she claims to hate.  She is rude to people in service and lower positions and the sales people who wait on her - she doesn't seem to be all that successful either - evidently makes a pile of cash but is incapable of controlling her assistant - male - and seems willing to let her firm use her as well - oh well the writing was clever in each sentence and this was definatly a book to capture many issues relevent to today - maybe i am a holly hobby but wasn't thrilled with the repeated theme that people who are \\"nice\\" or \\"had happy childhoods\\" will get trounced on in the big bad world of heavy competitors.
0385504209|4.0|Take what you previously thought about the Holy Grail, the Roman Catholic Church, the Crusades, the Mona Lisa, Leonard DaVinci and the role of Mary Magdalene and forget about it.  Set in modern times, The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, uncovers a mystery thousands of years old.  \\"Langdon nodded, unable to imagine a less congruous backdrop for the legend he was about to tell. He wondered where to begin. The brotherhood's history spanned more than a millennium... an astonishing chronicle of secretes, blackmail, betrayal, and even brutal torture at the hands of an angry pope.\\" Infused in a clever story, Dan Brown reveals the real truth of the Holy Grail, which is believed to be the cup of Christ, and the story behind it.<br />Brown takes numerous religious conspiracy theories, some of which question the very beginnings of Christianity, and combines them with a murder mystery to create a readable and fascinating story on two levels. The reader is brought into the fast paced chase of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Langdon, a schoolteacher, is accused of murdering curator Jacques Saunie&Igrave;re, of the French Louvre art museum. Sophie is an agent with the French DCPJ (The French equivalent of the FBI) whose grandfather was Jacques Saunie&Igrave;re.  She believes that Langdon is innocent and that Saunie&Igrave;re left a message for them to protect the Holy Grail. Along with the unveiling of conspiracy's and a secret society that existed for over 2,000 years.  Art, Medieval history and religion are wrapped around the murder mystery that moves the story along at a fast pace, with every chapter ending in a cliffhanger.  It makes a real page-turner.<br />The year is 1099 and the Prieure&igrave;&igrave; de Sion - the Priory of Sion- is created to protect documents of infinite power.  These documents, if revealed, would destroy the Christian faith.  What is contained in these documents is not entirely clear, but for thousands of years the church has been trying prevent them from being released.  The Priory of Sion is a group made up of various people including Leonardo Da Vinci. This secret society is the only group that knows where the documents are and only the leaders, known as se&igrave;ne&igrave;chaux, understand what they contain.  \\"It cannot be! The curators true identity, along with the other three se&igrave;ne&igrave;chaux, was almost as sacred as the ancient secret they protected...\\" This quote in the prologue is one of the ways Dan Brown pulls you into the story by creating a desire to venture deeper into the book in order to understand exactly what is happening.<br /> The book begins with the curator's murder.  Langdon, an American, is in France for a presentation on religious symbolism and was supposed to meet Jacques Saunie&Igrave;re after.  There was enough circumstantial evidence to accuse Langdon of murder, but the curator's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, believes that he is innocent and helps him evade the DCPJ.  Following coded clues that Saunie&Igrave;re left for them, they discover a key to a bank deposit box containing a piece of the puzzle that will help them find the documents.  The pair are led to many other pieces leading them to discover the truth. Along with the French authorities, they are perused by a fanatical sect of the Catholic Church known as Opus Dei who wish to prevent the truth from coming out.<br /> The author uses extensive imagery that places the reader in the world of the story. His description is very useful because he is good at getting the details down. \\"He was staring into the mouth of a long, deep canyon. On either side of the gallery, stark walls rose thirty feet, evaporating into the darkness above.  The reddish glow of the sirvise lighting sifted upwards, casting an unnatural smolder across a staggering collection of Da Vincis, Titians, and Caravaggios that hung suspended from ceiling cables...\\" This imagery continues throughout the book enveloping the reader into the book.<br /> One of thethings I like about the Da Vinci Code is the pace.  In the beginning of the book the pace is slow and methodical. While later in the book the pace is rushed, often only giving a little amount of description.  I think that this is an excellent way to perceive the changing pace of a book.  In real life you wouldn't look stop to look around and describe how a certain object looks while the police are chasing you.<br /> Dan Brown uses his skill in developing the characters to move the story.  His characters are interesting because they are believable; they have traits that are in real people. As a reader, it makes the story seem like it could actually happen.  A perfect example of this characterization is when Silias, who basically is the man doing the dirty work for Opus Dei, is told to find the documents at any costs.  This includes murdering someone if he has to.  There is a moment where this character is in the position where he might have to kill someone but in the end he decides against it.  It was interesting to see a \\"bad guy\\" that was not pure evil and seemed to have morals.<br /> The best-devolved character is Robert Langdon.  As the protagonist, he is the most important character, and Bown did a wonderful job of creating him.  Because Langdon is a schoolteacher he is someone you would not expect him to handle the many perilous situations in which he finds himself.  However, he proves to be courageous and able to think under pressure.<br /> This book is an incredible read.  Dan Brown writes an amazing novel that you will want to read over and over again.pace is slow and methodical.

His characters are interesting because they are believable; they have traits that are in real people. As a reader, it makes the story seem like it could actually happen.  A perfect example of this characterization is when Silias, who basically is the man doing the dirty work for Opus Dei, is told to find the documents at any costs.  This includes murdering someone if he has to.  There is a moment where this character is in the position where he might have to kill someone but in the end he decides against it.  It was interesting to see a \\"bad guy\\" that was not pure evil and seemed to have morals.<BR> The best-devolved character is Robert Langdon.  As the protagonist, he is the most important character, and Bown did a wonderful job of creating him.  Because Langdon is a schoolteacher he is someone you would not expect him to handle the many perilous situations in which he finds himself.  However, he proves to be courageous and able to think under pressure.<BR> This book is an incredible read.  Dan Brown writes an amazing novel that you will want to read over and over again.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Somehow, Radiohead has managed to create an experimental album, with lots of computerized and synthed touches, that still has emotion and beauty.  The technology lays bare the emotion and pure gorgeousness of the production.  <BR>I have been told that this a concept album about the first human clone.  That's interesting, but it's not necessary information to enjoy the album.  <BR>Some highlights:<BR>The album  begins with &quot;Everything in its Right Place,&quot; which begins &quot;Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon,&quot; something that I still don't understand, but that I couldn't get out of my head once I heard it. <BR>&quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; is one of the most beautiful, depressing songs I've heard.  &quot;I'm not here, this isn't happening,&quot; sings Thom Yorke, with such incredible despair.<BR>&quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot; are far more catchy and quick.  Not coincidentally, they are also the only ones to get any radio play.<BR>If you're an &quot;OK Computer&quot; or older Radiohead fan, this may not be the album for you.  For though it is brilliant, it has very little in common with the alternative rock/pop of their previous works.  It also takes a few listens to really understand the artistry of the album and figure out some of its idiosyncracies.  <BR>This is not an easy listen, but it's perfect mood music to zone out to, or to play as a background at a gathering.  It's mellow, but not invasive, and still electronic enough to keep the room moving.<BR>Amazing album.  You have to hear it to believe it.
B000000IW8|5.0|Guns N' Roses has been one of those bands either you take it or leave it, With all of the pluses and minuses that has gone Good and Bad their one the bands i always stick by, More or less the good bad and the ugly. The band's song's have helped be threw lots of good things and bad things, with Use Your Illusion 1 and 2, there concepts and ideas are more right out there then ever before, I can only wonder what he next 25 plus years bring, what we need is an acustic album.
B00008RV1L|5.0|When I walked out of the theatre after seeing this, I was blown away.  Not just by the sex and the violence, but also by the great writing, acting, and overall atmosphere of the movie.  I thought it was astonishingly raw and very good.  My companion felt the complete opposite.  This is typical of the reviews of my friends: some loved it, some hated it.  No one was in between.<br />What I'm trying to get across with my anecdote is that this movie, brilliant though it is, is just not for everyone.  The sex and the violence are so raw that I still find them disturbing.  However, they are nowhere near the book in terms of those (see my review of the book, coming shortly).  This movie manages to capture the important ideas and themes of the book, without the gratuitous violence.  <br />It's still a violent movie, though.  But it has so many redeeming qualities, so don't judge it on that alone.<br />Some standout features:<br />1. The exploration of identity.  <BR>This comes through an amazingly tense scene in which Patrick Bateman, the lead, exchanges business cards with friends/rivals.  This was such a powerful scene that I find myself holding my breath whenever I watch it.  There's also a lot about mistaken identity.  I believe this is to show the utter lack of identity one had in the vile, excessive glamour of the rich in the 80s.  Everyone was interchangable.<br />2. Not knowing whether the killings are real or a part of Bateman's sick fantasies.  <BR>I'm inclined to go with the latter, but there are some great, skillfully ambiguous scenes that allow you to make an argument either way.<br />3. The music/pop culture soliloqueys<BR>These are in the book as well, and they're fantastic.  Bateman has some interesting music tastes.  He treats the lightest pop acts with the same weight as another would treat classical composers.  These pieces are hilarious.  Even if you hate the rest of the movie, you'll love these.<br />This is just a great movie.  Definitely watch it, just not with a weak stomach.  And know that you will either love it or hate it.
B000005J56|5.0|On Monday, December 8, 2003, Ruben Gonzalez died at the unregretful age of 84.  Farewell to an unbelievably charismatic and talented musician!  His death is the sad realistic reminder that as great musicians like him grow old and die, so does a priceless era of music that will never be emulated.
B00002E23E|2.0|I saw this movie for a class and, though I consider myself to be very much a Led Zeppelin fan, I thought the movie was terrible.  Part of the problem was that this is 1/2 very bad, pretty much plotless movie starring Led Zep, and 1/2 pretty darn good concert footage.<br />What this movie does well is show the amazing showmanship and incredible magnetism of the band, something that may not be evident to those of us too young to have seen them perform.  Robert Plant is an amazing frontman and it was fascinating to see the unattractive Englishman with bad teeth (sorry, Mr. Plant) that I saw at the beginning of the movie morph into an amazingly attractive, vibrantly sexual performer by the end.  The raw passion of the band is laid bare. <BR> <BR>A drum solo from John Bonham that lasts (I kid you not) 20 minutes exemplifies my feelings on the movie, because though I found the solo electrifying in short bursts, I was also checking my watch by the end of it.<br />Again, if you're a diehard Led Zep fan, you might like this.  I would still suggest you rent it, rather than buy it offhand.  If not. . .buy the albums.  Enjoy them, because they are phenomenal.
B00005JMFR|4.0|The plot was certainly much better in this movie than in Reloaded, although the mindless psychobabble pretending to be serious philosophy persisted in this film. The action sequences were a little over the top (need I say it...completely unbelievable). Now I realize that what goes on in a movie isn't real, and everyone knows that. It's obvious. But the Matrix series, being sci-fi, are by definition supposed to present possible futures containing possible events, and the sheer logistics of both Zion and the final fight scene with the machines are completely impossible. That struck me immediately, and so profoundly as to prevent my enjoying that part of the movie. It was so ridiculous that I couldn't get into it.<BR>The primary redeeming aspect of this film is, of course, the incredible Hugo Weaving. <BR>The ending was, to put it mildly, incredibly naive. We already know from the first film that the Matrix needs the human \\"slaves\\" in order for the machines to continue to function, so how is it that there can peace without one side completely and finally defeating the other? Even the Oracle hints at that at the end of the film. <BR>As far as the philosophy/theology is concerned, I have to say that it's about 90% gibberish and 10% just plain wrong. As a Christian, I can certainly sympathize with those who want to find a hidden Christian metaphysic in the plots of films, and indeed many films can be pointed to in which such a worldview can be found, albeit sometimes unintentionally (the Shawshank Redemption comes to mind). However, to be completely honest intellectually, I am compelled to say that the Matrix series as a whole, and Revolutions in particular, borrows more from Eastern pantheism (Hinduism in particular) that it does from Christianity. This is most evident in the fact that Neo is not resurrected at the end of the film. There was a little bit of Neo in Agent Smith, and a little bit of Agent Smith in Neo. Neither one is good or evil in the Christian sense, andNeo is not the Messiah while Agent Smith is the devil or some other similar notion. They are avatars: they are beings who are able to control natural forces (i.e., they are not supernatural like the Christian Messiah), and, in the classic dualistic sense, the two of them must \\"cancel each other out,\\" as it were. The Hindu influence is also evident in the whom Karma discussion near the beginning of the film. Revolutions also borrows from Fascist Existentialism in its glorification of the \\"Triumph of the Will\\" (as Hitler put it) and its glorification of violent force. The theme of the movie (along with the others) is the ability to choose (and of course no consideration whatsoever is given to whether the choices being made are the \\"right\\" choices). So, philosophically, I found the movie disappointing, albeit interesting. As a whole, the movie could've been better, but I think it was the natural conclusion to the series. It will definitely be worth buying when it hits the stores.
B00000DREB|5.0|Great classic thrash/death metal. .44 Caliber Brain Surgery has to be one of the best metal songs ever written. Its a shame that these guys didnt get the recognition they deserve. If you see this at a used CD store, go out and get it. Amazon surely isnt going to get it anytime soon.
B00007EBAG|5.0|I was very surprised to find out that Terence Trent D'Arby had<br />changed his name altogether (to Sananda) and made this all new album. It seemed sort of like a disguise to me, or that Terence was trying to avoid being pigeon-holed by his former career. This is a very novel idea-to come back and show everybody that it is his talent , not his name, that takes him places musically. It also shows incredible confidence in his abilities. To me it seemed far-fetched though, since you can not possibly hear him sing and not immediately know who it is. He's got a classic powerhouse voice that will probably always harken back to his former hits, but on Wildcard, he continues to excell in his art. I was not at all sure what this new cd with so many tracks on it would sound like, and I was so blown away by it after just one listen. It appears that this album has been an incredible effort for the artist to make a truly great cd, and I think he has certainly done it. His style shows through in every track ,and the songs take you places you have never been before. Every track is unique and original to me, and once again his voice just couldn't be more amazing in range and texture and maturity. If you at all liked D'Arby's earlier work, this one will be an unexpected treasure. I hope that more people catch on to this album and it becomes as appreciated as it really deserves. This one should have spawned a number of commercial hits if the music scene weren't so fickle.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have been reading the latest reviews for this album...and they are so mixed...and for good reason!  This CD is neither classic material that you will be hearing 20 years from now, nor is it so horrible that you just want to break the CD over your knee.  It's right where Britney intended for it to be: in the middle.  Face it folks, she is still a young adult, caught in between the Max Martin pop days and a more mature sound.  This CD is all about discovery.  Britney is still trying to discover herself.  It is definitely evident with the variances in sounds, production credits, and writers on the album.  I still think it is pretty darn good considering.  The best songs on here are &quot;ME AGAINST THE MUSIC&quot;, &quot;SHADOW&quot;, and &quot;BRAVE NEW GIRL&quot;.  I would highly suggest giving it a chance.  If my cousin can buy it (and he HATES Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera both) and enjoy her songs, then you can to.  Stop trying to compare Britney to the sounds of her past, and just enjoy what she has to offer today and look forward to what her future might bring...for both her as an artist and for us fans!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Man I thought that silver side up was a good album.  I hadn't heard the Long Road.  There literally isn't one song on this album that i don't care for.  Some I like more than others, like Satruday Nights Alright... and Yanking Out My... are amazing songs.  But the list goes on, Flat on the Floor, Someday and Believe It Or Not.  There are so many hits it is astounding.  I love the cool guitar backgrounds and intros.  I don't know what else to say besides go out and buy this album!!!  Don't think twice.
B000063DFP|5.0|I have, over the Last close to 20 years, worn out at least one vinyl and countless cassetts of this metal masterpiece. A must have for anyone who considers themself a metal lover. My 14 year old son heard for the first on vinyl and was hooked. Nikko, drives it home with some of the most solid precussion work ever heard. Great lyrics from Harris and Dickinson especially revelations. If you are new to metal, or just somehow missed out on this monument, this will change your play list.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a beautifully written novel that is carefully, yet perfectly intertwined and pieced together. Its plot is fascinating and captivating; I found it extremely difficult to put the book down. When Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is called to a crime scene to help investigate the murder of an elderly curator of the Louvre, he doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Langdon soon finds himself mixed up in a muddle of puzzles and enigmas with cryptologist, and granddaughter of the curator, Sophie Neveu. But nothing is as it seems after the discovery of this curator's membership in a clandestine brotherhood, the Priory of Sion, is unveiled. This ancient brotherhood holds an ultimately powerful, historical secret which is desired by more than just Neveu and Langdon. In a battle of wits against an unknown powerbroker who hasn't ceased to track them flawlessly, the pair struggle throughout Paris and beyond to uncover some of history's most prestigious riddles. Clearly The Da Vinci Code is a novel in which no one can pass up the opportunity to read. It was one of my personal favorite books that I've read.<br /><br />This particular novel is rich and overflowing with knowledge. I love to read books in which I learn a lot of interesting facts without knowing it. This was certainly one of those books. The Da Vinci Code drew me in as a reader and wouldn't let me back out, which is another quality in books that I love. The main source of this quality comes from the fascinating story plot, as well as the writing style. During the journey throughout the novel, the reader feels a sense of being in the dark constantly. Naturally, one feels that when in the dark, they need to keep reading and reading until they're back in the light. This is precisely what happened to me, and most of my peers who read it. The continuous mysteries, shocking exposures, and baffling riddles keeps the reader drawn in throughout the course of this novel. These are all the reasons why The Da Vinci Code is not only a book I'd recommend to anyone my age or older, but it is also a novel in which I found few flaws.hy The Da Vinci Code is not only a book I'd recommend to anyone my age or older, but it is also a novel in which I found few flaws.
0790729369|5.0|I think this just may be my favorite movie of all time.  With the wonderful electric connection of these two top stars, they pull off the most simple, yet complex set of characters --  come to life -- and leave me wanting more!  I adore Clint Eastwood and have enjoyed his talent for years, but this movie is number one in my book.  Real.  Romantic.  Very well written and excellent performances.  This story will leave you thinking of &quot;what would I have done&quot; at the moment when Francesca sees Robert pull in her driveway to when she places her hand on the knob of the truck door.  Nothing has every been so moving emotionally as seeing Robert standing in the rain with that look of understanding and acceptance of her decision to stay on the farm.  My last thought -- If Clint Eastwood was standing in the rain looking at me that way, I would have opened that door and ran into his arms!  Clint, are you reading this???
B000002UAX|3.0|Does anyone agree? Granted the Beatles wrote some great songs but that's just where it all ends.  They were not particularly great singers.  They were seriuosly over-hyped just like thriller for this album(white album). This album is just pop/rock bunched up together and packaged for your consumption.  Great musicianship is embodied by pink floyd in my opinion.  Nonetheless this is still a descent album and worth buying.
B00012FXB8|4.0|the special edition alien3 makes so much more sense than the theatrical version. having reinstated 30 minutes of footage- the character development end of this version is much more fleshed out and coherent. inexplicable scenes and dialogue now make sense and enhance the plot line of the original release. the beginning of the theatrical release does'nt \\"start\\" untill 15-20 minutes into the special edition, showing us what happened to each deceased character in greater detail than the \\"computer screen\\" image typing \\"cpl. duane hicks...deceased\\" to sum up where newt and hicks are. this scene also makes the prisinors salvage of the EEV more plausable and introduces the planet \\"fury 161\\" much more accurately than the two quick scenes in the theatrical release.<BR>however, some of my favorite scenes were re-cut with different dialogue and or different settings which give more perspective but detract from the momentum of some scenes (\\"dillon's\\" 'last stand' speech for one) and make some transitions seem clunky. other scenes have been completely removed to allow for the special edition's  sub plot lines to adhere (instead of a dog being the host in this version we have an ox birth the alien..(and the dog was a more convincing \\"burst out\\" scene in my opinion...) which in turn deletes the scene between the \\"diced\\" prisoner and his dog \\"spike\\" alltogether...\\"who would do such a thing to a dog?\\") all in all- i enjoyed this version more than the theatrical one (i acually learned more of the characters names and backstory's and cared when they died) but it would be nice to have a \\"hybrid\\" version of the two (kudos to the above reviewer) in which we could have the best (scenes) of both worlds. the special edition manages to fill in all the gaps- despite the jaggedness of the peices.
B0000DDAU9|4.0|I decided I had to buy Remission based on the opinions of two of my favorite reviewers (Wheelchair Assassin and WPA).  The bad news was that I was unable to find the original version of Remission anywhere.  The good news was that I found the 2003 Limited Edition reissue.  It took me about three days to recover from the shock that came from listening to a CD that was so heavy, so intense, and so good.<br />Relapse records has quite a roster of unique bands.  And let me tell you, Mastodon is no exception.  They have achieved something on their first album that few bands do in their entire careers; they have established their own sound.  Nowadays, it seems that a lot of groups are trying to be the next Dillinger Escape Plan or Meshuggah.  And while Mastodon possess a mastery of their instruments that put them in league with both aforementioned bands, they bring in an element that seems to contradict everything math-metal is about.  That element is sludgy stoner rock riffing.  Of course it helps when two of your members (guitarist Bill Kelliher and drummer Brann Dailor) were in the technical metal outfit Lethargy.  But it really isn't their technical skill that impresses me about Mastodon, it's the feeling they put into every riff and drumbeat.  They MEAN every note they play whether it be the unbelievably beautiful intro of &quot;Ol'e Nessie&quot; or the bonecrushing beginning of &quot;March of the Fire Ants&quot;.<br />The DVD, which was filmed in Mastodon's hometown of Atlanta,  really isn't much to write home about.  The sound quality is atrocious.  Bassist Troy Sanders' vocals are entirely too loud (he's actually louder than the instruments).  and guitarist Bill Kelliher's vocals aren't loud enough.  But I give it two stars for two reasons:<br />1.  It was free.  That appeals to cheapskates such as myself.<br />2.  It proves that Mastodon are capable of backing up live what they do on the album.<br />Also included on the LE CD,but not on the original version, is an outstanding cover of Thin Lizzy's &quot;Emerald&quot;.  The vocals actually sound a bit like Phil Lynott.  It's far better than that crummy &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; from a certain little-known band from San Francisco.<br />Overall rating (for both CD and DVD combined): 4.25 starsoutstanding cover of Thin Lizzy's &quot;Emerald&quot;.

B0000039QA|5.0|Notorious BIG only had two albums, both of which are arguably the greatest of all time.  Life After Death was his last statement before his untimely death.  He wasn't even alive to see how much this album was appreciated by the people.  One of the few double albums that have been released in the past years hits on all cylinders and then some.  From deep dark songs like &quot;You're Nobody (till somebody kills you)&quot;, &quot;Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;, &quot;Somebody's Gotta Die&quot;, and &quot;What's Beef&quot; to more uptempo (happy) songs for lack of a better word like &quot;Going back to Cali&quot;, &quot;nasty Boy&quot;, &quot;Mo, Money Mo Problems&quot;, &quot;Hypnotize&quot;.  But whether he is deep and dark or uptempo and proud, Biggie delivers.  His amazing flow really shines on &quot;Notorious Thugs&quot; when he collaborates with the Bone Thugs.  His flow switches to quick and witty just like Bone Thugs always do.  &quot;I Gotta Story to Tell&quot; does exactly what the title says in which biggie tells a story about a woman.  An  amazing laid-back beat accompanies that track.  If you haven't heard this album yet by now, you're missing out on something spectacular.  I recommend this for everyone.
B00005JM02|5.0|This immensely entertaining and highly enjoyable family film is a modern marvel of Pixar's computer animation advancements and is endlessly enjoyable for kids and adults, as proved by it's immense box office success.  When a clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) becomes seperated from his young son Nemo, he travels across the vast ocean to find him.  On his journey he meets a blue tangfish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who suffers from short term memory loss, while having plenty of encounters with sharks on what resemble to be they're version of a twelve step program (&quot;just one bite, just one bite!&quot;), jelly fish, sea turtles, seaguls, and pelicans.  The animation is superb, Pixar has come such a long way since Toy Story all those years ago; and children will find immense enjoyment in the colorful, friendly fish life to be found in Finding Nemo.  The rest of the cast of voices features Allison Janney, Geoffrey Rush, Willem Dafoe, and Eric Bana.  The DVD itself is a modern marvel of DVD technology, and is absolutely a must own for parents and they're children.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed Finding Nemo, believe me give this film a look, you won't forget it.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This is a great movie.  I don't love Daniel Radcliffe as Harry cause I feel he acts to pompous, but its great
B0000TB014|4.0|This is definitley one of those really great MJ moments. The videos are amazing! problem is the way they shortened &quot;Bad&quot;,&quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;,&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;+ &quot;Black Or White&quot;. My favourite on this DVD is by far &quot;Blood On The Dance Floor&quot; I mean, its such a great video, it may not be a classic but damn it its really good. This DVD comes in 4 different covers &quot;Off The Wall&quot;,&quot;Thriller&quot;,&quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Dangerous&quot; They all reflect different songs. Ive Got the &quot;Bad&quot; cover, though I really wanted The &quot;Dangerous&quot; cover. All together....this DVD is great! It would be amazing if they made those videos more longer and used some other ones like &quot;Remember The Time&quot; and god, atleast &quot;Heal The World&quot; its MJ's fave MJ song I was certain they were gonna include that on the DVD. This DVD is great!!!!. You may feel A Bit Odd and I guess ripped off if you own &quot;HIStory Videos Vol I&quot; and &quot;HIStory Videos Vol II&quot; well I did, but it comes with videos I have rarely ever seen like &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, &quot;Blood On The DAnce Floor&quot;,&quot; Man In The Mirror&quot; and even &quot;You Rock My World&quot; so it is value but then its a bit cringey. But I want to collect all Of MJ's works and if you are like me and also want to collect all of his works then this is one DVD you should definitley not miss out on!.

B00004XONN|5.0|Im not making any judgements about people because ultimately music is subjective.  But this music is for a certain type of person.<br />This will sound really snotty but, if you are wondering if you will like this album consider a few things.<br />Do you write music?<BR>Do you try to write music that is original and visionary?<br />Do you listen to music that goes beyond the obvious and into uncharted exciting territories?<br />Are you looking for a new asthetic in music?<br />Are you interested in advancements in other arts?  Visual, Culinary, Poetic, Literary...?<br />If you answered yes to some of these, then buy this.<br />Also remember that this peace of music isnt meant just to play for 3 minutes going to work.  Its meant to be experienced like a large painting.  I recommend laying down in the dark, possibly with headphones and imagining the band writing or playing this. The dull spots/songs are emotionally empty areas put in there for a reason, take advatage of them as a release of tension and as broad soundscapes.  THis band is smart, they meant for this to be an experience, not a radio spot.
0553213105|5.0|The book Pride and Prejudice was a book about love and its consequences. This book tell us about  the life of people on the 19th century in England, how they lived and how they felt.  It also shows a true story of love, how sometimes pride can be stronger that the love that people feel, and marry for love and not for social status which happen to woman very often back then. Elizabeth Bennet is the second oldest child on her family. She is a strong, intelligent, and a beautiful, independent girl, she makes good judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudice. The best chapter was the last one when Mr. Darcy goes to Elizabeth's house and they tell each other about their feelings, and Mr. Bingley and Jane got together too. I would give this book five stars because this is a great book of love.
B00005JM02|5.0|My two-year old loves Finding Nemo and I like watching it with him, too.  What else can you ask for in a family film?  The story has a good message about fatherly devotion and doles out plenty of good one-liners.  Once again the Disney-Pixar combination is gold.

B00009TB5G|3.0|Taken by itself, TTT is a wonderful movie with gorgous scenery and an incredible tale to tell.  It's a cinematic masterpiece by Peter Jackson, cast, and crew.  Unfortunately, it cannot be taken by itself - it must be compared to Tolkein's epic novel.<br />The main failing in this film is the warping of Faramir and the Ents from their depiction in Tokein's LOTR.  Tokein's work was at its core a classic battle of the outnumbered forces of good versus the powerful, merciless forces of evil.  The characters' motives are as important as their actions in showing their inner strength or weakness.  In Jackson's film, the final actions are the same, but the motives behind them are entirely different.  <br />In the novel, Faramir resists the temptation to possess the ring from the beginning.  He doesn't require instruction in its peril to come to the right conclusion, he instinctively knows that seizing it would ruin him.  Jackson, however betrays his inner strength by causing him to initially succumb to a desire for power and approval before finally releasing the ringbearer.<br />In a like manner, the Ents are made to seem self-serving.  Tolkein portrays them as wise ancient beings who are slowly awakened to the treachery of Sauruman and his threat to all of Middle-Earth.  They act against him out of a desire not only to protect themselves and their trees, but also to aid Men, Elves, and Dwarves in the defeat of evil.  Jackson eliminates their desire to help their fellow sentient creatures and shows them as merely grumpy old men who strike out at Sauruman after he messes up their back yard.<br />Both of these changes were unneccessary and betrayed the characters that Tolkein wrote.  This huge departure from Tolkein's vision marred an otherwise wonderful film.

B0000TAZBK|5.0|This is a great way to own all three soundtracks if you haven't bought the individual soundtracks previously.

0316666343|4.0|Yes, this was a unique and wonderfully written book, and it made me think back to my junior high days, with the friendships, sports teams, families etc. But all the way through I thought &quot;Are these police for real?&quot;  Because they seem completely at a loss to solve the crime, and later in the book truly pitiful! Also, the community, though appearing at a memorial service for the ghostly victim in heaven, did not seem as outraged by this atrocity as one might think..(And I grew up and still live in the Philadelphia suburbs locale). Nonetheless there were some wonderful moments and scenes, in the school, hospital, homes and anywhere else you can mention...But the large dump? Were these around in 1973, and could a family run this as a business? Seems unlikely. This pit would probably be condemned as unsafe! ..Some good reveiews here, so I'll keep mine short and simple, but my short criticisms point out some real flaws in what should ahve been a terrific book...Plus one wonders how this got all the PR and hype, when there are hundreds of others out there every year at least as well done as this!

0375703764|3.0|I've never read Pynchon, I've never read Pale Fire, I've never read Ballard, or Wallace, or Dean Koontz or Stephen King or Derrida or any fawqing semiotics. I'm stupid, and uninformed, and the Oulipo, Beckett, Robbe-Grille and Roland Barthes are the extent of my education into post-modernism. I never read scary stories. A pretentious maelstrom of pseudo-intellectualism impresses me. And I really, really like thinking about big empty rooms. Being as I am, I liked the Navidson Record portion of this monstrously expensive hunk of paper. It absorbed me. I got sad when my favourite character died. And hell, I put a picture of a spiral staircase on my wall. The Johnny Truant storyline bored me to tears, though. I just didn't care. But if you're like me (i.e. stupid and easily impressed by kitsch and showy BS) than by all means, knock your dang socks off and impress the waifish hipsters in tiny Bright Eyes t-shirts...but please, if you've got some background, some education, or you're a connosiuer of scary stuff, save your money and spend it on the cool s--t I know you know all about. <br />And Danielewski...um...please...for the good of the written word...quit.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me just start by saying I can't stand TV. I don't really like anything on TV, and with all my homework (college) I don't have much time.<BR><BR><BR>This show was created by Joss Whedon, the maker of Buffy and Angel, two shows that don't click with me at all. So it's weird that this show would spark so true to me. Though Whedon created it, many eposodes are written by different people, and you can tell sometimes, as several of the episodes have different tones. The first aired episode (train) was the worst, but don't get me wrong it was still great and amazing. It was a good example of different tones though.<BR><BR><BR>This show in my opinion, is the best TV has ever had to offer. But I'm hard to please, and my tastes are very unique. I am drawn to failed tv shows like the early 90's Brisco County Jr (with bruce cambell) and the 80's Robin of Sherwood British TV show. For me to say everyone is going to like this would be a lie. Several of my good friends who have similar tastes in movies/tv didn't like this show, but then again, just as many did like it. <BR><BR>So you need to know what to expect with this show. It is a space western. I'm not talkin John Wayne style, I mean in theory. Its a science fiction show about a crew that poilets a ship called serenity between planets. They get money by doing odd jobs, many of which are illegal. This future world has no aliens in it (bout damn time). The clothes, weapons, and worlds have a westerny feel. They explain this by saying that out on the border planets, the riches of the technologically advanced inner planets are lacking. So the people are forced to live in the same manner that people did in the good old west back when. Some people will Hate this feel, I love it however. I think it gives this a step away from the Cyberpunk of Blade Runner and the Shiny cleanlyness of Star Trek. Plus the Blue Gras style music is a definite plus.<BR><BR><BR>This show usually has self contained espisodes(40 mins a peice) with deeper plots that span the series. The characters are well written and easy to get attached to. The special effects are amazing. Brought to you by the same programs that liven up other shows like Smallville etc. They are hollywood quality and actually brought home numerous awards last year, despite the series cancelation.<BR><BR><BR>I can't gaurantee anyone will love this, but what I can gaurantee is taht it is well made. whether or not you like the style, there is no denying that it was carried well. The costumes, characters, storys all relate and fit together perfectly. The cinematography, acting, directing, music/sound are also top notch and fit together perfectly.<BR><BR><BR>One reassuring thing I can say though, is those 3 bonus episodes are great. I was given the opportunity to see them (thank you internet), and I can gaurantee they hold the same quality and continuity of all the other episodes (and don't be expecting crapy footage or missing scenes, they were 100% done and ready to air, just never were). <BR><BR><BR>Give it a try, its 15 episodes (piolot was two parts long) for a great price. Most people will find something to like in this.<BR><BR><BR><BR>-Chase

B0000DD7NL|3.0|This is a really good album. I would not say it is better than her first (which has some really amazing songs on it), but it is certainly worth purchasing. I have to agree with the other reviewer though, on the point that this album focuses mostly on the ups and downs of romantic relationships, not really on the ups and downs of life, which she did on her fist album (to her credit). The two albums are quite different in theme and style. \\"Diary\\" has more of an \\"old school\\" feel to it - \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" track #5 (the best track on the album to me) is the perfect example of the classic old school flow, as are \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" and \\"Wake up\\". This new direction suits Alicia, but this album lacks that certain \\"umph\\" that was so evident in the first. All-in-all, it's good - just not dynamic.
B000002HPT|5.0|This album is so captivating and melodic. John Myung once again  shows his wide range of bass wizardry with his debut with the chapman stick. Derek Sherinian takes the keyboard to a whole world of techno and melody. Mike Portnoy seems as though his one goal is to make sure every drum and cymbal go straight to your eardrum. John Petrucci makes me jealous because I want to play guitar like he does so bad-he makes it look and sound so damn easy. And James Labrie hit notes and sings so well his voice will haunt you in your sleep. In other words these guys seemed all too prepared when they went in the studio for this album.<br />Breakdown:<br />New Millenium- Great opener. Displays melodic aggression. 10/10<br />You Not Me- A little too commercial but still not bad. 10/10<br />Peruvian Skies- Seemingly dark and ends with a bang. Great! 10/10<br />Hollow Years- Definitely a great song. Soft and touching. 10/10<br />Burning My Soul- Oh yeah! The name elaborates. 10/10<br />Hell's Kitchen- Once again JP makes it sound all to easy. 10/10<br />Lines In The Sand- Masterpiece! A 12+ minute masterpiece! 10/10<br />Take Away My Pain- Myung is at it again. Great bass! 10/10<br />Just Let Me Breath- James' voice breaks all boundaries! 10/10<br />Anna Lee- Great job by Derek. The drums kick in just right. 10/10<br />Trial Of Tears- This alone is worth buying this album for! John Myung smoked that paper when he wrote this song. The drums,bass, guitar,keyboard,and even James kicked ass on this song! 10/10<br /> Well,there it is. All you need to know about this album. Buy it and every other album,you won't be sorry!<br /> Cody\\"Dream Theater Maniac\\"Kircher<BR>           SEIZE THE DAY
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead seems to have reached the point where they simply cannot produce a bad record.  While \\"Hail To The Thief\\" does contain their worst song in years (the vile \\"We Suck Young Blood\\"), the rest of the album continues the musical excellence they achieved with \\"The Bends,\\" \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A.\\"<br />\\"Hail To The Thief\\" synthesizes the disparate elements of Radiohead's style into a cohesive work.  The explorations in tone color and meter that marked \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" are here, but reassembled into the rock format Radiohead mastered on their earlier works.  Having deconstructed rock on their last two records, they've in essence reconstructed it here.  Stanley Donwood's cover art, which juxtaposes cultural buzzwords into urban landscapes, becomes an apt metaphor for the music within.<br />The one-two punch of \\"2 + 2 = 5\\" and \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" quickly establishes an aggressive tone, before seguing to the gentler strains of \\"Sail to the Moon\\" (somewhat reminisicient of \\"Pyramid Song,\\" but dreamier).  The rest of the album dynamically shifts between syncopated rockers (\\"Go to Sleep,\\"  \\"Myxamatosis\\"), atmospheric electronic tone poems (\\"Backdrifting,\\" \\"The Gloaming\\") and strategically placed slower songs (particularly \\"Scatterbrain\\").  Phil Selway, the band's unsung hero, holds it all together with brilliant yet understated drumming.  <br />It may be early to say Radiohead has produced yet another classic album.  But the smart money says \\"Hail To The Thief\\" will stand the test of time.
B000002HEM|5.0|This is probably the best CD I own.  I'm not a big fan of this style of music, but everything came together for this masterpiece to be produced.  The quality of the recording, the subtle changes in the songs, the vocals and the emotion that Natalie Merchant shows makes this CD a must own for everyone.<br />Because The Night is a great song, but Jezebel is by far my favorite.  The raw emotion of that song gives me chills everytime.
B000069AUI|5.0|On 2000's &quot;Parachutes,&quot; Coldplay showed they could write great songs (&quot;Shiver,&quot; &quot;Yellow&quot;).  With this record, they prove they can write a great album.  &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; pleases the ears without insulting the intelligence.  <br />If you haven't heard &quot;Clocks,&quot; &quot;In My Place,&quot; or &quot;The Scientist&quot; by now, you're living under a rock.  The rest of the album measures up - and occasionally surpasses - the promise of those fine singles.  Coldplay turns up the tempo and rocks out on tracks like &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Daylight,&quot; providing dynamics sorely missing from their debut.  On &quot;Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;Warning Sign,&quot; they continue to develop their mastery of ballads without ever sounding trite or hackneyed.  Perhaps most impressive are the dramatic opening track, &quot;Politik,&quot; and the slowly building closer, &quot;Amsterdam.&quot;  It's all very radio-friendly, to be sure; but it definitely holds up through repeated listenings.<br />The improvement from &quot;Parachutes&quot; to this record is astonishing and bodes well for Coldplay's future.  Along with The Flaming Lips' &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; and Doves' &quot;Last Broadcast,&quot; this was one of the three best albums of 2002.
B000002KJQ|3.0|To sing the way he did on this album Billy Gibbons swallowed a frog and put a peg on his nose. He then proceeded to boast about all the sex he's paid for out of the corner of his mouth as if it were some great accomplishment.      But this whole nasally fake bluesman facade wears thin by the end of the album. However there's enough good rock music (and nasty guitar playing) on here to justify a pass mark. 2 1/2 is about right, but worth rounding up to 3 if need be.
B000002JKA|5.0|This Dream Theater album was my first from them, and it was enough to get me hooked.  As time progressed, however, I realized that this was not exactly the right album for a beginner such as myself to get into this fabulous band.  It is far darker and heavier than most of their other albums (except for SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE and TRAIN OF THOUGHT, which are exceptionally heavy).  James LaBrie's voice is a rather vicious snarl on many of the songs (namely \\"6:00,\\" \\"Caught in a Web,\\" and \\"The Mirror\\" and \\"Lie\\"), and while he frequently has sung this tone before, it is not his usual, marvelous singing that has become his trademark.  John Petrucci's guitars chug with a well-performed metal sense, and holy COW, Mike Portnoy's drumming is insanely complex, but with frequent bouts of crashing and booming like thunder.  John Myung's bass keeps a steady rumble throughout, and Kevin Moore (on his last DT recording) has rather icy (but frequently warm and beautiful) keyboarding.<br />Songs such as the aforementioned four are especially heavy, and somewhat short by DT's standards.  As well, the first song in the A Mind Beside Itself trilogy, \\"Erotomania,\\" makes an extremely heavy prologue to the other two songs, the far quieter \\"Voices,\\" and the acoustic \\"The Silent Man.\\"  Other songs, such as \\"Innocence Faded\\" and \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" have more of a \\"traditional\\" DT sound (but there really can't be such a thing, because this IS progressive music, after all), and this makes for a very eclectic, but well-organized, album.<br />Lyrically, some of the songs are almost frightening in their contrast to Dream Theater's normally more mystical (but not exactly \\"cheerful\\") writing.  Take, for instance, the lyrics to \\"6:00\\": \\"So many ways to drown a man/ So many ways to drag him down/ Some of them are fast and others take years and years.\\"  Wow.  This is definitely Dream Theater's heavier pinnacle in their earlier years that established them as progressive METAL.<br />Then there are the lighter songs, such as \\"Innocence Faded.\\"  This song is especially marvelous.  It is highly melodic, and carries the listener on a gentle stellar breeze.  Just listen to the keyboard-laden pre-chorus and be taken away.  And just LISTEN to James LaBrie sing those higher notes in the second verse...what notes he hits!  And John Petrucci's outro picking is just fabulous.  Marvelous song.  As well, \\"Voices\\" is epic, sweeping, and yes, fairly heavy.  Definitely one of my favorite DT songs.<br />As I said before, this is not a Dream Theater album for beginners, because of how heavy it is, but even if it is a first, you may might like it in the end.  It was, after all, my first, and now they're one of my favorite bands.  Regardless, this is a must for any Dream Theater fan.  A dark, overlooked masterpiece.
B000060P79|1.0|This is the worst peice of crap ive ever heard....the guy sounds like a whiney little chipmunk which drives me crazy....i love cananda but why did they have to bring these guys here ahhhh....if u want a good canadian actual punk band listen to propaghandi but this is the worst excuse for a punk band ive ever heard...there annoying and there lyrics are even worse...dont buy this unless your an 12 year old who doesnt know better.
B000068GA4|5.0|Danzig's second album features more of the blues-influenced, Sabbath-themed metal that made them popular.  Musically they are a major improvement over the basic sounds of their self-titled debut, and lyrically are just as playfully dark.  John Christ really begins to show his guitar talents here.  Eerie Von's bass is still simple but very effective, and Chuck Biscuits is coming along well as a drummer.  Glenn Danzig himself has also polished his singing abilities and vocal range, and really creates some great songs here.<br />The album starts right off with \\"Long Way Back from Hell,\\" a fast-paced riff piece with great bass and drums present.  It is even with this song that it becomes clear that there is much more musical diversity on this album, as evident in songs such as \\"Devil's Plaything\\" (a great semi-ballad with slow, melodic verses and heavy, powerful choruses).<br />Other songs, such as \\"Killer Wolf\\" and \\"I'm the One\\" really emphasize Danzig's blues influences.  Just listen to them to know what I mean.  The latter song is acoustic-based, and is sometimes just the thing to listen to when you want to feel powerful.  Ooh, I love that song.  Also, \\"777\\" is an acoustic/clean-electric based blues rocker, complete with slide guitar in the chorus!<br />Finally, \\"Blood and Tears\\" is a piano/keyboard-peppered semi-ballad with sort of melancholic choruses and general feel, with mostly clean guitars and a nice, slower beat to it.  Great solo from John Christ, too.  This song is possibly the best on the album.<br />All in all, this album is not nearly as good as DANZIG III: HOW THE GODS KILL (that one is their absolute peak, in my opinion), but it is still quite good.  This is where Danzig really begins to form similarities to the Doors as well as Black Sabbath.
1577311523|4.0|This book is a good introduction to the concept of living in the spacious present.  It is written in a question-and-answer format and essentially says the same thing over and over again throughout the book, which can get old but is on the other hand useful for its continual emphasis.<br />I like some of the new ways in which he presents old ideas, for instance, thinking as an addiction, which helps me to relate it to my many other addictions.<br />I also particularly like the concept of the pain-body.  Tolle describes the pain-body as the accumulated pain from your past, which almost literally forms an invisible entity that feeds on your body and mind, which stimulates you to think and feel painful things.  (This is quite similar to the concept of the Parasite in don Miguel Ruiz's The Four Agreements, a book with a similar quality and style.)  Thus the pain-body is, in a sense, an objective being that feeds off of negative thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and behaviors.  Dealing with the pain-body means not to struggle with it, but instead to pay attention to it and accept it.  Awareness and attention shine like a light in the darkness, dissolving the pain, quickly or slowly but surely.<br />The ideas are of course old ideas, though dressed in interesting contemporary language and addressed to modern readers.  The book repeats the same concept over and over throughout, from different angles, which may appeal to some who need a lot of explanation and may turn others off if they already have a sense of it.<br />I do have some criticisms, which keep me from giving this five stars:<br />First of all, on occasion Tolle makes subtly patronizing statements toward things or people that are not fully &quot;enlightened.&quot;  For instance, on p. 81, he writes, &quot;Because we live in such a mind-dominated culture, most modern art, architecture, music, and literature are devoid of beauty, of inner essence, with very few exceptions.  The reason is that the people who create those things cannot -- even for a moment -- free themselves from their mind.  So they are never in touch with that place within where true creativity and beauty arise.&quot;  Elsewhere he similarly dismisses physicists' search for &quot;dark matter&quot; and critiques our culture as being &quot;almost totally ignorant of anything that truly matters.&quot;  I truly cannot see a reason for vague, inaccurate, and judgmental overgeneralizations in a book about attention and acceptance.<br />I also find his sections on women and homosexuals odd.  He maintains that it is somewhat easier for a woman to become enlightened because women are more in tune with their bodies.  Does that mean athletes have a better chance than couch potatotes?  He also asserts that it may be easier for homosexuals to be enlightened because: &quot;Being an outsider to some extent, someone who does not &quot;fit in&quot; with others or is rejected by them for whatever reason, makes life difficult, but it also places you at an advantage as far as enlightenment is concerned.  It takes you out of unconsciousness almost by force&quot; (p. 144).  So does that mean all social misfits and outcasts are further ahead?  The homeless?  Ethnic minorities?  Disabled people?  Why single out homosexuals?<br />But my main criticism of the book is that he emphasizes &quot;being in the Now&quot; as both the path and the goal, thus neatly avoiding a lot of hairy questions.  His response to every question is simply that you have to let go of the mind and be in the present.  Certainly that is the way things should be in an ideal world, if enlightenment were really easy.  But as another reviewer said, this is like 0 to 100 mph in ten seconds.<br />There are many problems in most people's lives and selves.  Tolle's book doesn't do much in the way of guiding people through their issues.  Although he pays lip service to the proper use of the mind, he does not explain where it or the ego belong.  Nor does he make clear exactlywhat you do when the &quot;pay-attention-and-it-will-go-away&quot; formula doesn't work, i.e. when the issues you are facing are a good bit thornier than that.<br />There are also a number of &quot;mental&quot; questions that aren't really discussed but would have contributed to my overall understanding.  For instance, if you are paying attention to an intense emotion that is occurring right now, you are definitely not paying as much attention to your physical surroundings.  Which one is more in the Now?  A seeming contradiction; never addressed.<br />Indeed, his maddening response to a similar question was: &quot;You haven't yet grasped the essence of what I am saying because you are trying to understand it mentally.  The mind cannot understand this.  Only YOU can.  Please just listen.&quot;  Which was then followed by several paragraphs of repetitive explanation.<br />Overall, I think Tolle is rather simplistic in his presentation.  To a large extent, this simplicity works because the emphasis on living in the present is so important, and everyone could use a large dose of it.  But readers should be aware that his treatment of the topic is incomplete and in some instances very unhelpful.<br />But the message is still extremely valuable.  For the emphasis on the Now alone, I recommend this book.  I would say, read the parts that speak to you.  The core of what he's saying is really just, PAY ATTENTION, and he never stops saying this.<br />For a more thorough and compassionate book about the spiritual path, try &quot;A Path With Heart&quot; by Jack Kornfield.
B00000IP2L|5.0|Take about a keg of beer, a Gibson guitar, and a hick with the talent to play it, and you'll get something resembling SONIC BREW.  This is a hefty slab of \\"suth'n frahd\\" heavy metal, very similar in style to some other bands as Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar, Eyehategod, and some of Phil Anselmo's (Pantera singer, for the uneducated) various bands.<br />Zakk Wylde, long known for his work with Ozzy Osbourne, formed his brief band Pride & Glory (another \\"redneck metal\\" band) back in 1994, but they broke up after their first and only album.  Then in 1996 he released his solo album, BOOK OF SHADOWS, which was mostly acoustic folk and country music.  Then, slightly overlapped by this boozy southern rock-influenced period, he released this album under the moniker Black Label Society in 1998.<br />This album is heavy as SIN.  Just listen to...well, any song.  Almost every song is so damn heavy, with overdubbed, chugging, no doubt downtuned guitars and endless levels of distortion.  The bass rumbles with the sound of the breaks of an 18-wheeler, and the drums (kudos to Phil Ondich, formerly of another southern metal band, Raging Slab) pound away with talented power.<br />No two songs sound the same, yet at the same time, the whole album just trucks on by with it's uber-heavy southern-influenced metal.  All of them, of course, except \\"T.A.Z.,\\" which is a short acoustic instrumental.  Always thought that acoustic guitar was not good for shredding?  Just listen to this and prepare to poop your pants.<br />Zakk's solos dazzle, of course, and he is the king of riffs.  He's a great acoustic guitarist also, as well as pianist, bassist, and of course...SINGER!  So many people tend to neglect how talented he is as a singer.  From deep, growled (but not death metal) snarls to clean, powerful singing, he can do it all.  He has to be one of the most talented musicians out there to this day.<br />By the way, the lyrics are nothing masterful or heartfelt; most of the time, Zakk is singing about drinking, or...well, mostly drinking.  He's a heavy drinker, but he works out a lot to keep his body in shape (hence his bulging muscle-look).  So don't worry about this promoting drinking to kids, but don't expect ultra well-written lyrics, either.<br />The bass in most of the songs is splendidly performed by Zakk himself, and is also monstrously distorted.  Just listen to the intro and verses to \\"Mother Mary\\" and see for yourself!  When Zakk does heavy, he means HEAVY.<br />Phil Ondich's drumming is very good.  He forms fairly complex patterns, is fast, and fits Black Label Society's style with perfection.  I'm very curious to check out his work with Raging Slab now.<br />The songs are all great, but my favorites by far are \\"The Rose Petalled Garden,\\" with it's overdubbed intro, very Alice in Chains-esque in its sludginess, \\"Hey You (Batch of Lies)\\" with its great, catchy chorus, and \\"Peddlers of Death\\" (a heavier cover of one of his own BOOK OF SHADOWS-era songs).  This last one is rather eerie with its synthesizer/piano-peppered verses, and yet it's so heavy, with a wonderful guitar solo. n Also, his cover of \\"No More Tears\\" is phenomenally heavy, with ultra-chugging guitar riffs replacing the classic bass intro.  Finally, I've recently become a fan of \\"World of Trouble.\\"  LISTEN to that riff in the verses and just try to tell me it isn't catchy and worth headbanging to.  Unbelievable.<br />Finally, I'd just like to state that Amazon.com never seems to listen to me when I try to correct the information on this band.  Yes, Zakk Wylde is involved, but the band really is called JUST \\"Black Label Society\\"; not \\"Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society.\\"  Also, the cover is DIFFERENT now, guys...Oh well.<br />Now pop out the beers and turn up the volume, because Black Label Society is here to rock your world with southern-fried heavy metal!  YEE-HAW!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|If you think that you can predict her next move, think again. Alicia Keys can shock you by mixing her street vibes to classic R&amp;B. She tastefully combines the two styles to something sultry and classic. The Diary of Alicia Keys does not sound like Songs in A Minor. The styles are similar and both excellent. Its wonderful to know that she switch up her style and give the fans a new dose of ear candy.
B000002HAF|5.0|The Pixies' music has always been catchy, fuzzy and more than just a little distorted(in sound and in lyrics). This album is a picture perfect example. The cover is a photo of a sultry Spanish woman flashing her [chest] admist decorations and Christmas lights. This is their most fuzzed out release, Steve Albini produced it so you know its not going to be studio polished, and boy does he rough the sound up. The raw sound is not a negative, it actually adds to the overall affect, a good example is \\"Something Against You\\", the grungy, static sounds only add to the psychotic feeling the songs create. All the songs are great, the only slightly weaker tracks would be \\"Toni's Theme\\" and \\"Gigantic\\". Most cite \\"Gigantic\\" as the highlight of the album, but I disagree, to me it sounds like typical commercial MTV drivel(its nothing against Kim;she is an excellent bassist and a great vocalist). This cd and Doolittle are the greatest of the Pixies, and if you dont own these cds and you say your any kind of respectable \\"punk rawker\\" or rocker in general you need to go pick these up.

B0000C7PQK|2.0|After waiting a long, long, long time for another release from Michael Cretu's Enigma, I am bitterly dissapointed. Not only has Enigma turned its back on what made it great, Cretu has totally taken Enigma into the almost unlistenable.<br />I have all Enigma's CD's and listen to the albums frequently, but I will not be listening to Voyageur ever again. There are no notable songs worth listening to. What happened to the Gregorian Chants?<br />Cretu you cannot change the style of Enigma and think that the music will still sound good and the much anticipating fans will love it. In my opinion, Voyageur is not worth buying...I will wait for Enigma 6, and hopefully Cretu will return Enigma to its roots....Love, Sensuality &amp; Devotion.
B000002C4J|5.0|This album will remain a clasic example of Celine Dion's timelessness and brilliance as an artist.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|is she's a musician because she is very skilled and experienced at what she does and is able to produce music. what makes her different from britney, ashanti, beyonce, and etc. is she can CREATE, and WRITE her own music with unlimited boundaries because of her piano artistry. with that kind of background, she can easily whip up anything out of nowhere, ad lib, and that's TALENT. even if she sampled, she has the ability to convey an incredible force of emotion and feeling to a song that speaks to the soul. also, when she samples, ATLEAST she makes it sounds DAYUNG good and as original like the sample in comparison to other remakes i've heard. she will be one of those rare musicians in the music industry in comparison to roberta flack, and stevie wonder.  don't dis on her. maybe she's not using too much of her piano artistry because she is trying to improve on other weaker areas that she needs to work on in her music development. even though she's young, i give my props to her because she IS extremely talented or atleast she has a most definite potential of becoming so. because of her artistic and classic style of musicianship, she will most likely be creatively innovative in all of her records to come. i can't wait to see how she'll turn out in a couple of years because she makes good, worthwhile music.
B000001Y79|5.0|Wow this cd is classic cd of No Doubt that no fan should go without. It includes the single &quot;Don't speak&quot; and a lot of other &quot;sca-like&quot; beats that'll have you groovin right along with Gwen and the band, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! :-0 :-)
B0000DYJM6|4.0|If you've followed Pearl Jam at all, you're well aware of their habit of putting otherwise unreleased songs on singles, soundtracks, compilation/benefit albums, etc. So, someone who doesn't have the time or money to track down all these songs can miss a lot of great music. Plus, who wants to risk getting a soundtrack that sucks otherwise?<br />For those who don't want to spend a small fortune getting all kinds of singles and other albums, Lost Dogs assembles some notables (and unknowns) in a simple, great package. <br />Lost Dogs covers most of their career, with B-sides and from virtually every era (Vitalogy is notably absent). Some have been heard before -- the ubiquitous Yellow Ledbetter and Last Kiss, and some were previously unavailable -- Sad and Fatal, among others.<br />What sets this compilation apart from most is that there are so many songs that you hear and wonder how they decided to cut them. It's not a collection of weak filler material. Several of these songs could have done very well on commercial radio. Most everything is really good.<br />Of course, the double album is difficult to nail perfectly. Usually there are some dogs (pun not intended) among everything else. But the bulk of the album is great and overshadows the occasional misstep.<br />Purists take note: Some of the songs on here may not be the original version you're familiar with. Fans have noted differences in a couple songs, but for the most part, it's nothing bad. <br />While it may not be everyone's dream compilation (I wish they would have included State of Love and Trust), the amount of stuff that is on here is great. And some songs -- Sad, Alone, Undone, Fatal, etc. are worth the price of admission alone. <br />If you're a fan, you owe it to yourself to check it out if you haven't already.
0920668364|5.0|The first time I heard this book was in college, during a Children's Literature class.  The entire class was in tears.<br />It struck me as a beautiful sentiment and a simple way to remember how much you love your child even during the most frustrating times of their life.  This is such an imporant thing to know and remember, especially when there is such abuse in the world.<br />I now buy this book as a gift for each person I know when they are expecting their child.  Again, as a reminder of how imporant children are to our lives.  Each person who has received it is moved and thankful, stating the same \\"this is the best book I've ever read\\"<br />I highly recommend Love You Forever to you and anyone you know with children.
0688172377|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!! A Human Geography teacher recommended this book to me, as well as others in the class.  I was very glad that I took her advice, and read it!! I could not put this book down!  I read it in 3 days!!  It's an incredible story.  I think it's very moving to see how much some people have to go through.  It really makes you appreciate what you have.  Definitely read this book!
B00008XEOI|5.0|I first saw The Lion King in the theater when I was 6 years old, in 1995. And since then, it has always been my favorite Disney movie. And yes, I have seen Finding Nemo, which is also a good Disney movie. And some say Finding Nemo is better then TLK. In my opinion, it's not. I mean, you just don't get that classic feel that makes you sort of \\"fall in love\\" with the characters. Anyway, the Collector's Gift Set is well worth the extra []bucks. Even with the detailed sketches of the characters ALONE are worth it. And in 50 years, I can see them being worth a pretty penny. Though, I should hope there's not one youthful mind who hasn't seen this classic 9 years ago. ;) And to that concerned parent: The word 'kill' was only mentioned two times that I can think of. And I've watched this movie well over two hundred times. It's rated G because there is no harsh language, and there is not really any blood. I am slightly agrivated when \\"concerned parents\\" try to make a good thing bad. I sincerely hope you will let your daughter play great First Person Shooter games, without putting up a fit that it influences violence..
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I picked this album up on the strength of the film -- easily one of my favorites of the year, and I enjoyed most of the music in it. Similarly, I enjoyed most of the music on this disc.<br />Kelly Clarkson and Dido's contributions stood out to me, while Wyclef Jean's seemed terribly out of place. It was nice to hear a mix of conteporary artists with older stuff like the Beach Boys.<br />Fans of the film will be happy to know that this disc does include the two standout musical numbers -- Bill Nighy's deliciously terrible and helplessly catchy &quot;Christmas is All Around,&quot; as well as the version of &quot;All I Want For Christmas is You&quot; performed by Joanna (the character's name, I don't remember the actress) at the end of the film.<br />Throw in one particluarly good instrumental piece and you've got a CD I'll be listening to again and again, only hitting the skip button once.
B000002WYT|5.0|This cd is the greatest of Dave Matthews Band. I have heard his other songs, I have some of his other stuff but this is the cd that I keep returning to. It is perfect for car trips or just relaxing. The song Two Step is amazing, it's absolutely phenomonal. The rest of the songs on the album are great, this album is absolutley a work of art. The album flows together, it is a must have for any collection.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great look at war, it's horrors and the young men trapped in it.  While it does a great job of showing us what war is like, it also does a great job of letting us know the people involved in the war.<br />It's a realistic and accurate depiction, which means it can get extremly bloody at times (and tense).  The acting is top notch, the special effects are excellent (but not over the top) and the scenery is just amazing.<br />If you like Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gate you'll love this.  If you are more of a Pearl Harbor (big effect, big explosions, romance plot beneath the war plot) you may not enjoy this set and I would suggest renting it first.
0375760067|5.0|I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today.  Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion.  Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out.  You feel it, you taste it, you live it.  It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying.  I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add.  I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar.  I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits.  And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism.  In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot;  He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again.  In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease.  A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark.  However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature.  There are so  many themes of the enduring truths  that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on.  Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them.  Hardy is one of those for me.  Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation.
B00007ELEL|4.0|This 1998 comedy was written and directed by the famous Coen Brothers.  I don't usually like comedies and I didn't particularly like this one either.  But I must say that I was engaged in the story and gave it a giggle now and then.  That's saying a lot for me.<br />The setting is Los Angeles.  The star is Jeff Bridges, cast as a what has come to be called &quot;a slacker&quot;.  It's never clear how he makes his living.  It seems to spend his days taking baths and smoking a lot of pot.  His one passion is bowling and his best friend and bowling buddy is John Goodman.<br />One day, some rough guys mistakenly think he is a millionaire with the same name and come to collect a debt incurred by the millionaire's spendthrift wife.  This leads to a series of events that get more and more complicated, involving our slacker hero is a series of escapades including a supposed kidnapping.  The dialog is sharp and funny throughout and includes a lot of colorful language.  The acting, especially by John Goodman, is great.  Jullianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro are also in the cast and add a bit more sparkle to the silly, but yet fast-paced story whose strength lies in its unpredictability.<br />Not bad for a comedy.  And it's fun to relax sometimes.  That's why I give it a modest recommendation.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|As reminscent of the old, &quot;Oh, you love it?  Well, why don't you marry it?&quot; joke, I have been in love with &quot;Want ONE&quot; ever since I got ahold of it.  My first listen through, I could not remember the last time I heard anything so beautiful.  The overabundance of strings and multitude of harmonizing vocals, along with the brilliant lyrics, blew me away.<br />Rufus is not for everyone, but for those people whose hearts he has won over, he is a godsend.  He speaks to the listener with such romantic, Shakespearean melodies.  The first time I heard &quot;14th Street,&quot; I felt a shiver jolt down my neck and was never able to quite recover.  It took me several listens before I was finally able to pinpoint exactly what the song reminded me of-- Queen's &quot;Somebody to Love.&quot;<br />Obviously there are fans of RW's who have followed him since his solo debut and &quot;Poses,&quot; or maybe heard of him from the various soundtrack work he has done.  And within these fanbases, there are bound to be those who do not &quot;get&quot; this CD.  I think it's important to remember the journey Rufus has undergone to get to this point of &quot;Want ONE.&quot;  Only after realizing the personal journeys and reflections that he went through can you truly appreciate this album.
078401213X|5.0|This 1998 film certainly is weird.  It's brilliant too.  And incredibly intense. Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, the Brooklyn-born, Harvard educated twenty-something young filmmaker, it was shot it black and white on a shoestring budget  and has achieved much recognition in the world of independent film.<br />The story is about an obsessed mathematician named Maximillion Cohen who is looking for the secrets of the universe.  Sean Gullette is cast in this role.  He's skinny, balding and manages to make the audience wonder if he is a misunderstood genius or mentally ill nutjob who's constantly popping medications and injecting himself with various substances just to keep sane.  He's a sympathetic character and it is a tribute to his fine acting that it was possible for me to identify with him.<br />The setting is the rundown area of New York's Chinatown, where our hero lives behind triple locked doors.  His computer takes up a whole room and the only resemblance to any computers I've known in my lifetime is the fact that it has a screen and a keyboard.  The one person he trusts is his aging mathematics professor who has long ago given up looking for those patterns in numbers which have been searched for by madmen and scholars from the beginning of time.  A young Orthodox Jewish man befriends him and gets him interested in the secrets of numbers in the Torah.  There's also a high-profile Wall Street firm which wants to use his findings to make millions.  The plot might be strange but it moves with the speed of light and there's no time to stop and think about the logic of it all.  Before I knew it, I was drawn into the story which included some chase scenes through the New York subway system.<br />Certainly, this is not a film for everyone.  But its an inspired showcase for raw talent in writing, directing and acting.  Therefore I give it a high recommendation.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I can't put into words how moving and powerful this soundtrack is. This soundtrack is just bursting with emotion. In the beginning of the second track, &quot;Spectres in the Fog,&quot; it's painlessly easy to feel as if you have been transported to the misty hillsides of the Far East. It's breathtaking. Towards the end of the score, in tracks such as &quot;Ronin,&quot; &quot;Red Warrior,&quot; and &quot;The Way of the Sword,&quot; the sheer force of the battles which take place in this film overtake you. All of the sudden - you can feel the intensity of these battle scenes, even if you have yet to see the film.<br />I highly recommend this recording. I agree with what someone else said - in some of these tracks, including the last three tracks I spoke of, one can hear a bit of the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; soundtrack in this music. This is what I thought in the theaters while watching the movie in the theater. However, this does not detract from the success and splendor of this score. I cannot keep this CD out of my CD player. This film score has moved me beyond words. Emotions swell every time I hear it. I know the same will be for you.
B000060P79|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  I saw them in concert 2 years ago and decided that they were pretty good.  Then &quot;Addicted&quot; came out and I've been hooked ever since.  I bought the album and didn't know what to expect.  I thought they would be something between Blink182 and Greenday.  I was right.  They're Blink 182 without the vulgarities.  It's fun (My Alien) and some of the lyrics are really insightful (Perfect)If you like music that keeps your head nodding with the music, this is the right cd for you.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|On this CD, we hear the Beatles sounding like a BAND--not some manufactured head-trip by someone not in the BAND.  The BEATLES is one of the greatest rock-n-roll bands ever--there is simply no argument about this.  Folks, this CD is not about YOU; it's about the BEATLES.  Quit whining.  Listen.  John Lennon's voice is clear as a bell--it's truthful.  Something you just don't hear in today's garbage-mouthed groups with bad lyrics, bad music and usually bad musicians to boot.  If ya don' like it----don' play it!  Capice??
B0000DJZA5|4.0|&quot;In comes the warmth and the freshness of a live performance&quot; boasted the sleeve of the final Beatles' album, &quot;Let It Be&quot; upon it's original release in 1970. The irony was that Phil Spector's treatment of the album, albeit a job well done to give the man credit where it's due, made the album sound anything like a live performance, what with orchestras and choirs and various other overdubs. 33 years later, &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; finally allows the listener to hear the album the way it was intended and it really does sound great, leading me to wonder just why George Harrison and John Lennon felt it necessary to bring in Spector to work on these recordings in the first place.<br />Some people have accused McCartney of wanting to finally get his own way by presenting this album the way he always saw fit. If that is the case then I, for one, am thankful as &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; offers a new insight into one of the Beatles' last projects and merely acts as an alternative, not a replacement, to the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album. The additional &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; disc provides further insight into the project, but interestingly the conversations selected give no indication that this was in fact a troubled period during the Beatles' career when relationships were strained between all four members. In fact, the only hint of tension or disagreement is George telling everyone he thinks it would be an insane idea to end the project by performing a concert on a boat.<br />The inclusion of &quot;Across The Universe&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; may seem a little odd seeing as these songs were recorded a year before and after the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions respectively, but they did appear on the original album and so I think that justifies their appearance here. However, it does seem a little strange that on an album where Phil Spector's input has been deleted we get the full 2 minutes and 21 seconds' version of &quot;I Me Mine&quot; that Spector lengthened from the original recording of 1 minute and 34 seconds, but that's just a trivial observation.  My only disappointment with this release is the non-inclusion of the complete 8-minute version of &quot;Dig It&quot; when this was such an obvious opportunity to present it in it's entirety and would have made for a wonderful major bonus to the album. &quot;Let It Be&quot; was always one of the Beatles' slightly weaker albums, but as was the case of the Beatles, even their weaker stuff was still great. &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is worth the buy, not just for a chance to listen to some of the Beatles' last songs with a new &quot;stripped down&quot; twist, but also because it proves, as if proof were needed, that even right up to the end the Beatles could still seriously rock together.; that Spector lengthened from the original recording of 1 minute and 34 seconds, but that's just a trivial observation.

0684833395|2.0|Judging from most of the reviews here I'm obviously going against the flow, which is bizzare since one of the reasons i decided to read Heller's book was exactly the fact that most reviewers are raving about it. Oh well, there's a lesson to be learned here somewhere.<br />    &quot;Catch 22&quot; is considered a classic but in my mind &quot;classics&quot; are books of the caliber of &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;The Stand&quot;, books that hold up in time and deliver their message in a way that isnt anachronistic. &quot;Catch 22&quot; does not belong in such an &quot;elite&quot; category. <BR>   It's supposedly &quot;hilarious&quot; but that's a very emphatic statement to make about humour and, hmm, i hardly laughed with it. Sure, humour is (as are many concepts) just a matter of perspective but from my angle of the world this was hardly enough to make you grin. Another paradox is that many readers claim you &quot;have to be well read&quot; to like this or (even stranger) you &quot;have to read this if you want to be well read&quot;.<BR>  This is absolutely untrue. What is actually true is that the more you've read the less the chances become you'll be thrilled by &quot;Catch 22&quot; and if you are not &quot;well read&quot; (which is hard to define anyway) &quot;Catch 22&quot; wont add too much to your thinking arsenal except in my opinion the obvious.<BR>   <BR>    So what is the obvious here?<br />   Heller goes into an overlengthy diatribe to deliver an antiwar message decorated with philosophy bits and some provocative thoughts. While he tries to bring forth the insanity of war he does so by using incredibly underdeveloped characters, a totally ineffective plot (if one can call this a plot) and humour that tries to be subtle sarcasm but fails completely as:<BR>   -if it's subtle i`t's so subtle it's almost invisible, and<BR>   - if it's sarcasm it's so harmless that it causes little concern to its targets.<br />I wont go into the story or the characters as many other reviewers have covered that in 1000s of reviews here. What i will add is this: &quot;Catch 22&quot; is painfully boring to read, it becomes almost a task as you go through the first 50-100 pages and you find the same concepts over and over repeated and what is supposed to be a &quot;storyline&quot; thinnning continuously until it almost dissapears. If all &quot;classics&quot; were like this my take is that literature could easily become mental torture.<br />   What i find even sadder is that Heller fails while actually delivering an important message. This only drives home the fact that you might have the right thoughts but this doesnt mean you can express them in a literary way. Heller would be probably better off had he written a straight philosophical book which would have been way more in his element. As it is he takes a shot at literature and doesnt miss as he hits the target head on and the victim expires.<BR>   All a matter of perspective as i said, but i would advise you to take a good look at both the negative and the positive reviews about &quot;Catch 22&quot; before you decide whether to read it or not. You'll be surprised how completely contradicting they are. Hilarious and boring dont exactly go together. If, however, you do go on and read it dont be surprised if you find that you're forcing yourself through it.
B000002P5W|4.0|In those days, it was hard making a rock album. In 1968, Jimi Hendrix's second album was released. He named it Axis: Bold As Love. By this time, Jimi was experimenting with lots of sounds and instruments. My favorite songs on this album has to be Castles Made Of Sand and the jazzy, Up From The Skies. This album really sounded gentle and if you ever hear Are You Experienced? and Electric Ladyland, you will notice that they had a harsh and loud sound to it. This is maybe one of his weakest albums in the Hendrix catalog, but it is a classic. Axis is as far as you can go for a gentle and kind, Hendrix album (for the exception of that experimental tune, EXP). Buy this if you're starting a Hendrix Experince collection.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|I love the Alien movies as much as the next person,but when is enough,enough.I mean come on do we REALLY need 9 discs to show how good these movies are?Who in the world doesnt have that much of a life to sit and watch hours of worthless extra features?Some outtakes,maybe one featurrete,few deleted scenes fine,leave it at that.I mean do we really care about screenplay's,screentests,commentaries,etc?Geez can we say Greed anyone.Just get the other smaller box set.Don't waste money.
0385504209|5.0|The best book I have ever read.  The only way anyone could write a poor review about this book is if they're a religious zealot.  If you are, do not buy this.  All others will be highly entertained.<br />I have never read a book other than this one that made me rush to the computer to learn more about the subject matter.  In all, I probably was on the internet for 15-20 hours.  I can't wait for the movie that is in the works and also for the next novel.  Thanks Dan.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Excellent album recomended to me by a friend I loved it as soon as I saw the cover. There were only one or two songs that might come under the category of &quot;very good&quot; the others were excellent. I strongly recomend buying this CD if you havn't already. A true Punk Rock album.
6305949980|5.0|One of Hollywood's finest soundtracks, fantastic directing and images, a wonderful script bursting with humor and symbolism, all apropriate for children of any age, coexist in, arguably, Disney's greatest film.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|While the cinematography and sound track are excellent, watching fight after fight where nobody gets hurt (stops fighting) and nobody really wins seems like a waste of time/effort.
B000002JSR|2.0|This doesn't compare to any of the other Zeps. Of course it can't because it is just a bunch of outtakes, though it still has some good songs like &quot;Wearing and Tearing.&quot; This should not be your first Zep album, but if you have all the others, I'd go for it. After all, bad Led Zeppelin is better than most else.

B00007AJF8|5.0|Craig Schwartz ( John Cusack)dreams of being a successful puppeteer, but is struggling to make ends meet. To make some extra money, he takes a job as a filing clerk. One day at work, he accidentally stumbles onto a door, that is really a portal into the brain of John Malkovich. For fifteen minutes, he sees, hears, and experiences everything that Malkovich does. Then he is dumped onto the New Jersey turnpike. Together with his beautiful co-worker Maxine ( Catherine Keener), and pet-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), they come up with a way to make &quot;Being John Malovich&quot; a profitable one, by charging 200 bucks a trip. The only problem, is that Malkovich starts to learn about what's going on... <br />&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is one of the funniest and most original films I have ever seen in my life. The script is amazing with its combination of puppetry, infidelity, and out of body experiences. The love triangle between Keener, Diaz, and Cusak is extremely well done, and fun to watch. It is also extremely funny, because they are only attracted to each other when they are inside Malkovich. The three really offer top notch performances. However, the best performance of all was given by the man himself John Malkovich. John is extremely funny in the role, and gives an accurate portrayal of what one would go through in his situation. Watching him as a puppeteer,will have you in tears from laughing so hard. The camera work on this film is outstanding. The film is actually shot at times, from the inside of John's head, looking out. <br />This extremely funny, and bizare film is truly one of the best films that I have seen in the last couple of years. The plot is extremely interesting and creative, the acting is perfect all the way around, and the camera work is amazing. The DVD is outstanding and offers an interview with director Spike Jonze, a look at the art of puppeteering, and a lot more. Definately a must own for anyone's DVD collection.
0451163540|4.0|I'm usually not big into spy novels...but I'm a big fan of follett so I gave this book a try.  At some times I found it a little hard to follow.  There's several names and factions from different countries going back and forth.  But the ending is as good as any slam bang ending from a spy/action novel as you'll get.  Great action once again.  <br />Follett has a talent for weaving fictional characters and stories around real life events and places.  This book is no exception.  While  not my favorite of Follett's various works, this is definetly a solid read that's worth a look.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Scientist Jeffrey Wigand ( Russel Crow)is fired by one of the largest tobacco companies in America. Wigand feels that it is his duty to blow the whistle, and warn the general public of the danger that the tobacco industry concealed about their products. Despite being under a legal and binding contract for employee confidentiality, Wigand throws caution to the wind risking his family, and his financial future in the process. He puts his trust in Lowell Bergman ( Al Pacino) who is the producer for 60 Minutes. Bergman puts together an expose on the tobacco industry by using Wigand's testimonial. The only problem is that the tobacco industry threatens with a multi billion dollar law suit, which makes the top CBS news executives, want to kill the story. Wigand is subject to numerous lawsuits and a vicious smear campaign, leaving his story in danger of never reaching the American people. Now Bergman and Wigand must work together to save their reputations, and possibly even their own lives... <br />This controversial and unforgettable true story is Michael Mann's best film without a doubt. The film features an amazing script that deals with the issues of journalistic integrity, coporate responsibility, and one's man moral obligation to risk everything, to tell the truth. The film itself is incredibly suspenseful, and you will be kept on the edge of your seat. It involves not only the fight for the truth, but the threatening of Wigand's life and family. Great mix of conspiracy and paranoia thrown in! Al Pacino is always great, and Lowell Bergman is no exception. His pursuit for justice and the truth is amazing. He never gives up, and actually stands by Wigand. He puts a whole new meaning to the phrase &quot; My word is my bond.&quot; Russell Crowe gave the film's best performance however. His portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand is filled with humanity, vulnerability, and selflessness. Crowe also put on some serious weight, to make himself look like the actual Jeffrey Wigand. Greatperformance all the way around. Christopher Plummer gives a nice performance as anchor Mike Wallace, and Gina Gershon is great as well. <br />&quot; The Insider&quot; is a masterpiece. The wonderful script, tons of suspense, and the overall acting are all incredible. While the film is long at 158 minutes, time flies, and it does not seem long at all. The DVD offers a production featurette, and commentary from Al Pacino and Russel Crowe. This film is definately a must own, and I highly recommend it!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is a true talent.  She has an amazing songwriting ability and truly soulful voice.  The songs on this album are well written and meaningfull.  She has definitely grown up since her first album and I see her as having many more tricks up her sleeve for the future
B00009TB5G|5.0|If you are reading this, then you must have at least a passing familiarity with the storyline, so I won't bore you by regurgitating widely known details. But I would like to focus on the extras. Most of the time, I think extras are pretty boring, and don't add much to the movie. But in this case, given the legendary reputation of the J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, a lot was at stake. Peter Jackson and company certainly did not dissapoint, and the extras are a testament to the staggering amount of work that went into this entire series, if you can even call it &quot;work.&quot; The desire to remain truthful to Tolkien's vision is constantly reflected in the extras, especially the featurette on writing the script. I am currently rereading the series, and am often startled how much dialogue is taken directly from the books. <br />Other features include a look at the making of Gollum, as well as a demonstration of the computer programs used to create those massive armies (the program is appropriately titled &quot;Massive&quot;). It's not only a fascinating look at special effects, but an interesting look at AI. There are also numerous other extensive documentaries covering sound, music and so forth. I had no idea that music was so difficult to implement. <br />My only complaint would be that the extras may be too extensive. There are 1000's of pictures, and I can't imagine too many people going through all of them. Also, four commentary tracks is a lot to slog through, especially considering how much information is on the 2 bonus discs. So it's an embarrassment of riches, and is that so bad?

B00008PW2D|1.0|People are a little too emotional about this show.  The first few seasons were pretty good.  The characters have become tired, the dialogue repititious and the story lines predictable.  It is not a matter of how much this DVD costs, or how many shows you are getting.  Put away your accounting visors.  It is about a show that was a fresh idea with ground breaking dialogue that became tired, dull and common.  Do not buy this DVD.  It says much about our culture that we continue to watch and support shows like this long after they become tired.  We are conditioned by what we think is cool.  This show has become so far from cool, it is the Sally Struthers of HBO series.  If you are into HBO and \\"ground breaking\\" comedy, pre-order Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm.  A guy that shouldn't be cool, a total nebbish, will become the coolest cat you know.
B000020617|2.0|Just broke this CD out again as I was bored with all my current music and wanted to take a chance- as I remembered this is the Foo's worst effort- very poor follow-up to the excellent The Colour and the Shape. It's nothing but a bunch of safe, cheesy, boring, pop rock songs that break no new ground or ever go anywhere- even Aurora, which is the best on the CD and a concert fav is average at best. One by One brought back the edge a bit, this one is not worth the time.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I'll admit it. I first heard Gavin DeGraw's song, &quot;I Don't Want To Be&quot; as the theme song for the WB's &quot;One Tree Hill.&quot; The song piqued my curiousity and I decided to investigate who sung the theme song I began to love so much. I came to Amazon.com and began to read and listen to other samples of Gavin's CD. Before I knew it, I was addicted. To add fuel to the fire, I saw Gavin on Sharon Osbourne and fell even more in love with this passionate and talented singer. (Okay, he's pretty cute too...)<BR>When I first listened to the entire CD, I really thought, this guy is going to be big. Not like John Mayer or any of that posse, but big like Billy Joel. The piano moves as well as DeGraw does vocally and lyrically. If you have fifteen dollars, go out and buy this CD. If you don't, borrow fifteen dollars and buy this CD. It's worth the price to listen to the rarity and treasure found in his words, song, and music.
B00006690G|1.0|Okay--hip hop has reached it's all time low.  Dre is NOT the best rap producer of all time, I think we all somehow got used to seeing this guy around, like Steve Urkel.  Hell, after a while, you actually begin to like nerds, and feel sorry for them. <br />That's what Eminem is--a nerd who sits and reads the dictionary all day.  That doesn't make him intelligent, though.  It makes him idiot who trys to step up his game because he really has no talent at all.  That's why he's mad at rappers who talk about popping cris and stuff.  He's mad because they can drop their verses and go have fun, while he has to sit up all night to create songs that will be accepted 90% by White America, who he disgraces on the song with the same title.<br />If you like slap stick rap that trys to send a message, this album is for you.  Me, personally, give me the classic rappers with meaning like Scarface, Ice Cube, 2Pac, Tragedy Khadafi, Nas, AZ, and Seagram.  THOSE ARE YOUR REAL GANGSTERS!! But most of you new school, dumb, foolish, idiotic, soft as grapes, whipper-snappers don't know a thing about that!  <br />Enjoy your little Eminem CDs.  He's not real.  If anybody believes this chump can back up the s--- he spits, that person is a chump himself.  I'm just saying, keep it real.  You don't have to be hard, EM.  You're not a street dude, and you don't know a thing about the struggle.  Wearing wave caps and going on--this cat needs to be shot.  Then rapping lines like...&quot;but I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life.&quot;  Look, dog, stop boring us with your reverse racism garbage, cause in actuality, it hardly exists.  The black race is one of the most accepting races in the world--do your history, and then look around you.  On top of this, you don't wanna be any other color, because in every other song you're mention the color of your skin.  Eminem is the ONLY rapper that makes pointless remarks about race.  <br />I'd listen to Vanilla Ice before I listen to this punk.   There are 6 billion men in America, and each one of them would whip his a-- every day of the week, from the youngest to the oldest.  I'd give the album a half of a star if I could.  <br />Thus far, this EM guy has yet to empress me.  For the white audience of hip hop--if you want to hear true hip hop talent, but don't want to buy black hip hop albums (cause that's the game ya'll playing), then I recommend old school white rappers like MC Serch, or even new school cats like Copywrite.  They have TRUE talent, and keep it real.<br />I'm out

B000075BFK|4.0|Before writing this review, i read a couple that i didn't agree with--like the reviewer from URB magazine.  This album is not Pac's best, but it's not garbage either.  Anybody who can release 6-7 posthumous albums from the grave is a damn genius, and you critics hate it.<br />Pac is probably one of my favorite emcees of all time, but this album doesn't display his raw talent at times.  Maybe because a lot of these songs are remixed to fit our day in age--which shows that everybody--including Ms. Afeni--is in it for money. <br />This isn't a bad reason, but just think about it like this...would the museums in Italy contract a bunch of Disney artists to &quot;remix&quot; Michaelangelo's Cestine Chapel?  Or better yet, would producers hire cats like the Neptunes and other producers to &quot;remix&quot; Elvis songs?  Then don't F--- with Pac's songs.  Just release what you have on analog or what have you, and let people take it for what it is.  True Pac fanz are gonna love it regardless.<br />Over all, Better Days is still solid, cause it's hard to screw up a genius' work.  Best songs are Fair Xchange (Jazze Pha's remix--I believe Pac would have worked with this cat if he were still alive), Street Fame (Hot Track), Better Dayz, Thugz Mansion (with Ant. Hamilton; the one with Nas was a waste of studio time and I'm a Nas fan), Never Call U B---- Again, Military Mindz (Pac and Boot Camp Click--LYRICAL GENIUSES AT WORK), and My Block Remix (A Pac Classic).<br />Still, I would like to hear the originals.  If you got'em on bootleg, holler at ya' boy :)<br />A definite go-getter for all hip hop heads.
B00008S2VG|3.0|A lot of people (including some fans) don't understand or don't want to realize that the commercial &quot;failure&quot; of this album resides on the creator herself &amp; possibly, her record company. This is not a bad album. It's very flawed, but there are some good elements in it &amp; it should be appreciated that Madonna chose a musical direction &amp; approach that went against radio trends by crafting a lyrically introspective acoustic/punk album with electronic sprinklings.<br />But she had a mission when she was about to unveil it. There she is, wrapping the whole look of the album in Patty Hearst meets Che Guevara revolutionary stance complete with beret &amp; machine gun. There she was coming with a video to the eccentric title single to blast everyone away. But at the last minute, she did what she's never done before: She developed &quot;scruples&quot; &amp; withdrew the video. If you thought that didn't have any effect on what eventually happened, you better think again. This act of self-censorship erased any notion of artistic integrity she might've talked about before &amp; thwarted the whole look &amp; intent of her aggresive image just as it was about to be launched. If you're still one of those who think that she did the right thing, all i can say is...look where it lead her: Never before has Madonna been so out of touch or so clearly shunned by radio. The title track needed that video to make it whole. Instead, people just derided it &amp; hated her cleverly ironic attempt at rap. The second single &quot;Hollywood&quot; just wasn't that strong either. In an effort to complete the release requisitions from this album for the record company, it is obvious that all the other planned singles (Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, Love Profusion)have now been released simultaneously on a remix CD- but these are not remixes, these are revamped, fleshed out new versions of the limp album tracks.<br />I say that this is an OK album, but her ethics (or the reasonings of the people that work for her) deflated it. Also, Madonna's latest shenanigans, such as selling childrens books (is she G-rated all of a sudden?) &amp; empty stunts (such as the &quot;lesbian&quot; smooching with Britney &amp; eventual horrid collaboration) just make her look desperate. <br />When you look back at this moment in pop culture, it won't be Madonna who will be shining in flying colors. The Dixie Chicks will. At least they had an opinion &amp; stuck by it. Gosh! Even JLO went to entertain the troops. Where was Madonna? Couldn't she had released her video statement AND gone to entertain the troops too? Instead the stayed safely confined inside her gilded cage (the one she warns us about).<br />Madonna, i will always be a fan (i bought AL) but you have a lot of damage control to do.
0808514121|5.0|Excellent book!!  Much better than in highschool, go figure! Such talent in writing, wish I was there in the time and moment. Truly one of the great writers in literature. A MUST READ in your fourties, you will appreciate it so much more!!!
B000002H92|5.0|All The Doors you need to own, along with &quot;Waiting for the Sun.&quot; This is a remarkable collection of live music, assembled with an ear for the music so that the tracks flow seamlessly together.  it helps that many of the tracks have been assembled into medleys including the fantastic &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; which takes in 7 pieces ranging from &quot;Lions in the Street&quot; to &quot;The Palace of Exile.&quot; This is Morrison at his best, on stage, unfettered, able to draw everything out of his magical songs.  The long, extended &quot;The End&quot; carries with it all the weight it had in &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot; But, it was concert gems like the pairing of &quot;Dead Cats, Dead Rats&quot; with &quot;Break On Through #2&quot; that really make this box set memorable.  There is plenty of music here which will keep you going for a long, long time.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have all of Britney's albums and this is the best.  This time, she does great dance songs.  Some have a Middle Eastern sound to them.  My favorite is SHOWDOWN. That song hypes me up!!
B000127LW2|5.0|This Star Trek towers above the rest! Putting in great storyline instead of boring technobabble every 5 seconds. Steer clear the super trekk geeks though, they try to bash it every chance they get. But don't worry, they are just making up for the lack of lives they have with their ignorance. This is X-Files meets Star Trek. Don't miss it!
B00000DGUY|1.0|This would have been a good cd except for the edited version of Money for Nothing which removed the most memorable line in any Dire Straits song - &quot;The Little F@got wioth the earings and the makeup.....&quot; I guess they got politically correct in their old age. In addition there is some very boring live recordings where the band sounds asleep. Not worth it!!!
0783240236|2.0|I decided to see The Birds for the simple reason that Alfred Hitchcock directed it(and also has a blink and you'll miss it scene outside the pet shop where he is walking two dogs). Melanie Daniels meets Mitch Brenner in a chance encounter at the pet shop downtown where he is looking to purchase some love birds. Later on, after finding out where Mitch lives; a coastal town called Bodega Bay, Melanie(Tippi Hedren) goes down to visit him so they get get aqainted better and she brings two love birds with her for his daughter Lydia. On the way over she is strangely attacked by a seagull which is later dismissed by the town as being an odd accident. The film drags on a bit and features a cool scene (SPOILER) where one of the men in the movie gets his eyes gouged out by a crow.Other than that the movie has no music score which I found incredibly amazing! Usually in movies the music works up when a suspense moment is about to happen and because there is none in the movie everything is so eerie and unexpected.
B000065VI2|5.0|This is some of the most truly moving music i have ever heard (and i've heard alot). Every song on this cd is just sitting there, waiting to toy with your emotions. I love every split second of this cd. Thank you dirty fiona.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I got this cd literally as soon as it hit the stores. Being such a big fan of A Perfect Circle, having being recommended them by a close friend, I just had to get the second installment from them. The band is back with an even more emotional album than their debut, Mer De Noms, and a new member Jeordie White(formerly Twiggy Ramirez from Marilyn Manson) as the bassist. Obviously if you've heard Mer De Noms, you'll agree with me that it would be totally worthwhile buying Thirteenth Step. Favourites include Pet and Crimes.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I initially dismissed this album as a harder, slightly better version of its predecessor. The album seemed to lose steam after a few songs (just like WBC) and Meg's drumming was a little bit too primitive for my taste. <br />Well, my opinion sure has changed. What was I thinking when it came to the songs losing steam? I'll get back to the songs in a little bit but now let me focus on the band itself. Jack White has grown as a frontman tremendously, from one a little unsure of himself and his limitations to a true original who bleeds charisma. Add in his impeccable guitar skills and he just might be the best frontman since Robert Plant in Led Zeppelin's glory days. And Meg's characteristic, and controversial, constant drum thump (no rolls, no nothin', just a constant beat on drums and cymbals) has clicked finally. Listen to the album and imagine it with a more talented (?) drummer, one who does rolls and that stuff. The album would lose its feel, seriously, with this overly-talented and finessed touch. Meg really is the backbeat of the band and you can't just take away her influence. Lastly there's the band's refusal to have a regular bassist, possibly their most alienating move. Yes, it seems like every good band has a great bassist, from Paul McCartney to John Paul Jones to Colin Greenwood. Two things to argue about this: 1. It would lower the chemistry and relationship between Jack and Meg in their music. 2. They actually do use a good deal of bass, or at least an octave guitar on Elephant. Check out the now classic bass thump on 'Seven Nation Army' and accentuating bass line on their new single 'The Hardest Button to Button.'<br />Now for the songs. The best way to describe them is to call them guitar work-outs, a lot harder then the relatively simple-sounding work on WBC. For evidence, look to the songs that really define the album, 'Black Math' and 'Ball and Biscuit.' The former is a great riff worthy of the great Jimmy Page and the latter is one of the best blues-rock riffs of all time with its tremendous improvisational solos between verses. This song is probably the best the album has to offer, as well as the equally wonderful 'Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine.&quot; One thing that I think really proves The White Stripes rightful reverence in our sub-culture is Jack's lyrics. He can go from writing about a desire to be accepted by a girlfriend's mother to singing about acetaminophen. Another great thing about this band is their willingness to churn out just as tender love songs as 'Ball and Biscuit' is raucous. 'Cold Cold Night' is Meg's singing debut and a great lite-jazz ditty, 'I Want to be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart' is a nice Rod Stewart style ballad and 'You've Got Her in Your Pocket' is one of the best acoustic ballads in recent years. Plus, Jack and Meg aren't afraid to partake in a little self-mockery, as witnessed on the closer, 'Well It's True That We Love One Another,' a great little folk parody targeted on the two bandmates' debated past.<br />Altogether, this album can be looked at as a classic in my book. This twosome is destined to do even greater things in years to come, if that's possible. The future of rock depends upon this.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|When I purchased this cd I didn't think it would be all that good.  Don't get me wrong, I love Alicia Keys, but by this being her sophomore album I wasn't sure how strong she would bring it.  I was completely blown away.  This album is great!  This is music for the soul.  This album is great for anyone who is in love, looking for love, fell out of love, or just wants to know love.
6305882592|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was 17 and having it open my eyes from childhood to adult.  Very profound about learning to love the inside and not being afraid of who you are.  I just rented tonight to share with someone and decided I should get my own copy.  Too good to not see!
0790729628|5.0|An amazing film that combines the two genres of sci-fi action and film noir. It even makes up for the inaccuracies toward the book with complete originality in the adapted script, this movie is one of my all time favorites, and I consider David Peoples to have created the best adaptation from a Philip K. Dick novel of all time, true brilliance. Make more Dave!
B000002J09|5.0|first of all, this album is very good, and well worth your money.  second of all, thank you&quot;Fred Durst's Numbah one Fan&quot; (or whatever your name is)for sharing your apparent lack of grammar skills.  I'm suprised you haven't recieved a virus in your e-mail that says&quot;Nirvana was active in the late 80's, early 90's, and Puddle of Mud definitely wasn't active that early&quot; Nirvana had(and still has) more musical talent than that crap you listen to. Once again, thank you for revealing your ignorance to us.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This was a good flick, but I only give it four stars. Because of the less-than-usual slang and no sex scenes, which are irrelevant anyhow, I wanted to give it five stars. But, it was too mediocre in some areas. There were a couple innovative ideas and the cinematography was good. It was also harder considering that a Pink Floyd track, my favorite group, was included (performed by a mix of musicians from non-PF bands). Definitely a safe date-flick.
B000000993|5.0|Tool came into the music world in the 90's when i was young. I first heard Tool and thought the lyrics were terrible. When entering my teen years, the lyrics fit into everyday life. This cd is one of the best if not the best 90's metal cd. Each song includes a complicated musical arragement that no other band compares to. The Undertow cd is a great cd to just sit back and listen to. Adam Jones (guitarist) explores the songs of drop tuning to a B. While the bassist may use simpilier bass lines the fluidity of the bass is amazing. Danny Carey (drummer) is by far the best drummer on the scene, anything from double bass to hi-hat properties are taken care of. While Maynard (lyricist) is hands down the best singer as far as dynamics to his voice all the way to his ability to scream at the top of his lungs and still sound great. OVERALL Undertow is a great Tool Cd, and i suggest all the other Tool cd's as well. None will dissapoint you.
B00005JM02|5.0|You know I got this video because of the kids, but as I watched this video, I realized that there is something in this movie for everyone! Here you got this father who is deathly afraid of going anywhere after watching his wife and tiny eggs get killed right before his eyes,all except Nemo. So, he tries to protect him, and on the very first day of school, he gets taken by this Australian dentist who puts him in his fish tank and wants to give him as a present to his niece. The best thing about this video is Nemo's dad, who wouldn't go far,always stayed close to home, goes out in the deep blue searching for his son, and Dory,who can't remember Jack past a minute, she was hilarious. And the turtles,  you couldn't help but love them. Get this video and enjoy!! I promise there is something for everyone.
B0000AN10R|5.0|Import versions are a little pricey, but always good for collectors. they always throw in a extra song, or a tourbook. Like this one has a Vapor trails minitourbook, I like stuff like that. extra stuff. Now the music is the same no extra tracks. However it would be nice if they threw in ceiling unlimited. But worth it.. great performance and good show...
B00005JMFR|1.0|The first Matrix moview was an incredible, cerebral, mind-blowing experience and hearing of 2 sequels coming out in the same year sounded almost too good to be true.<br />&quot;Reloaded&quot; was an immense dissapointment, and knowing that &quot;Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Revolutions&quot; were filmed at the same time, I must admit I held out very little hope that Revolutions would somehow be better than &quot;Reloaded.&quot;<br />A friend of mine said she and her husband enjoyed it, so I suspended my initial pre-judgments and a friend and I went to see &quot;Revolutions&quot; this past weekend. As many fans know, the lady who played &quot;The Oracle&quot; in the first 2 films died due to complications from Diabetes, so another actress took the role. Because she did look so different, the reason for her different appearance was put into the plot of the film - poorly.<br />Fishburne is back as Morpheus, but his role is minimal. There is a hinted past relationship with Niobi, but  it isn't really explored.<br />As the machines start to penetrate the outer dock of Zion, the volunteer military mans these rediculous human-shaped shooting machines that are so poorly balanced, they easily tip over. These are a total rip-off from the 2nd &quot;Aliens&quot; movie, and they are far from realistic looking. Some of the special effects are extraordinary, but the painted in CGI of these apparati are just poor quality effects... about the same level you'd see in a college film.<br />The wounds are also perposterous and look like they were created with the Halloween make-up kits you see in the holiday aisle at the local supermarket each October. One captain who is manning one of the obsurd walking/shooting machines is torn up by a sentinel (squiddy) in a quick shot that looks like his face was put in a blender. A young volunteer that idolizes the captain runs to his fallen hero. This man has gaping wounds in his forehead that look like they are 4 or 5 inches deep and they move when he talks. The head bleeds a lot when injured - a wound like this would not only knock any human unconcious, but just the blood loss would make him unable to see or talk... yet with these gaping split-loaf-bread type wounds, there is no bleeding and he is able to hang on long enough to give the kid a pep-talk. It is so cheesy, you have to restrain yourself from projectile vomiting.<br />The squiddy swarms are impressive looking, but that's about it. We learned in the first movie that an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) is their only defense against the machines. They are able to power down their ships so their own electronics are unaffected, and turn on the EMP to permanently render the sentinels et al inoperable within a certain radius.<br />With the unbelievable, unrealistic technical advances in Zion,  there isn't a single EMP in existence - only the sparse number of hover-craft ships in their armada are equipped with an EMP.  It's well known for news reports that a terrorist can build a small EMP for about $400... they aren't that hard to make. Even though the humans know that the final attack against Zion is inevitable, they have absolutely no plans for a quick power shut-down and use of an EMP... only a ship that makes it back to Zion can use one. What an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.<br />Some people have given the excuse that &quot;well, it is a sequel - they'd never outdo the first movie,&quot; but I just don't buy it. They literally put years into the preparation of the storyline of the first film, but preparation for the second film was focused more on CGI and choreography than plot. These sequels could have been incredible AND profitable, but are instead just profitable for the filmmakers, who are no doubt laughing all the way to the bank.<br />The sorry plot not-withstanding, the performances of Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) are the only true strong points in the film. While the viewer is spared the endless diatribe ofthe architect that they were subjected to in &quot;Reloaded,&quot; this final edition in the trilogy is - as hard as it is to believe - even worse than the 2nd installment.  During the film, people in the audience were laughing out loud and having conversations about how stupid the scenes were.  If the first Matrix movie had just been about eye-candy, these follow-ups might have been tolerable - since they have about the same substance as &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; but this is such a rip-off to fans who made the first movie such a cult success story.<br />Shame on the Wachowski brothers for rushing to make such drivel. I have seen the first movie at least 30 times and will continue to watch it - but I really don't think I'll go out of my way to see &quot;Reloaded&quot; or &quot;Revolutions&quot; ever again.the architect that they were subjected to in &quot;Reloaded,&quot; this final edition in the trilogy is - as hard as it is to believe - even worse than the 2nd installment.

B00008J2DQ|2.0|Godsmack has become one of those enigmas of the music industry--the band that just can't seem to get over the hump, even after six years.  Listening to Faceless brings to mind the spectres of Herman's Hermits, latter-day Metallica, and a longer-lived Faster Pussycat as examples of such a band.  While rumbling guitars and raspy vocals have become expected staples of Godsmack's sound, so have, unfortunately, Sully Erna's laughable attempts at thoughtfully-composed lyrics.  His brittle grate of a voice does not help elevate the simplistic lyrics beyond their woeful station--Erna's roaring delivers his words (styled on his own experiences) with all the giddiness one would expect from a man who has entirely too much time on his hands and uses none of it to pen something significant, meaningful, or even intelligent.  The worst examples are such disasters as 'I don't know you, so don't freak on me' from \\"Straight Out of Line\\" and nearly any two-line set from \\"I Stand Alone.\\"  While the guitar work continues to improve and solos are becoming more prevalent, Erna's questionable lyrical talent drags Godsmack further into the stagnant quagmire of bands that couldn't build on their potential.  Godsmack remains a band to watch, though preferably from a safe distance.
B00005JL96|5.0|This is clearly the best Disney I have ever watched!And I love life,because it doesn't stop here.There's also a brilliant sequel and an amazing TV series.Whatever it is,I virtually never stop watching Lilo and Stitch.I really disappoints me that Disney could well stop making their movies using traditional animation methods,as some of these are considerably better than the Pixar offerings.Monsters Inc was entertaining but isn't really designed for repeated viewing,and,no offence anyone,but Finding Nemo was awful!However I can recommend Lilo and Stitch to any hard core animated film fan,it's one of those that can really cheer you up when you're down.<BR>I've already been hearing rumours of a third movie release so someone better tell me the rumours are true soon.<br />After going back to check on updated reviews of Stitch The Movie it seems that the rumours of the third film are confirmed to be true now so Mahalo!Now I just wanna know when it's out and if it's going to the theatres or not.I hope so.Compared to Jungle Book 2,it deserves it!
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue is truly amazing. It's really funny that she's not popular here in the U.S., because she's HUGE all over the rest of the world. Just shows what bad taste we have, because this album is the BOMB. Tracks 1-5 and 7&amp;8 are the best, with the best tracks, being, of course, tracks 3 and 8! In Your Eyes is awesome! Yeah so cop this album now - KYLIE IS THE FUTURE
B000099T2L|5.0|This gal can sang. She does her thang solo and with a group. She reveals her sexy side, with Nasty Girl. Also, she reveals her intimate side with The Closer I Get To You. This album deserves to go platinum plus. She is consistent with the vocal and lyrical quality. This album displays hit after hit. Go cop this disk.
014043786X|5.0|This novel is out and away the best work that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did with his famous duo. The dark shadows of the moor, a family ghost, a family with a soiled member bent on homicide (quite ingeniously, by the by), an escaped murderer, and then the hound from hell itself! Great stuff, the stuff of legend. Five solid Sherlock stars from The Blade! Oh, and avoid imitations of this story. How do you improve on perfection? Quoth the Raven.
B000001EXB|5.0|Picture this! In the title track on this album,Elton John tells about a potential career in Hollywood(Do I have a shot at the big part?). Hits from this album are SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT(the first when this album was released in September 1997) and RECOVER YOUR SOUL. This album was finished before Elton's close friend Princess Diana of Wales was killed in a car crash nearly a month before this album was released. Also just before this release and immediately after Diana's death,Elton recorded and released CANDLE IN THE WIND '97 as a single with the same music as the original 1973 version from GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD but with different lyrics. It's also known as &quot;Goodbye,England's Rose&quot;. Great album!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Let me say upfront that I am no fan of fantasy. In fact, I loath it. Hell, I don't even like people that like fantasy. Nymphs and fairies and dragons don't do a damn thing for me. I even hated the Tolkien books. But, boy, did I like this movie. It is just flat-out well done entertainment. The various creatures and landscapes that occupy this movie are just fascinating. Everything is done on a massive scale. The action and battle scenes are worthy of a first class war movie, and the producers and director wisely decided to leave the violence of battle in the film. I plan to buy this DVD, which will be the one and only fantasy entry in my movie collection (I take that back! I did buy &quot;Legend&quot; just to watch tim Curry play the Devil).
B0000DD7NL|5.0|well,alicia,you did it again.all of the talk about a so called sophmore jinx,but i say what sophmore jinx?this album is outstanding.i really like your cover of 1 of my favorite songs ever,if i were your woman.also you don't know my name,and there is a ballad that gives me a chill everytime i listen at it.my favorite song is karma.the whole album is off the chain,and i hope to hear good music from alicia for many years to come.
B000063DHK|4.0|I'm hoping that I can stay as objective as possible with this.  I have not been a long time Maiden fan, but have given them some attention because of the sheer poorness of the current hard rock scene.  Maiden are good in the studio and many of these songs are not improved upon with a song that was done poorly in the studio and has &quot;come alive&quot; on stage.  That is not the case here.  Still, it has pretty good sound quality as far as live albums go.  It's not a good buy for &quot;Trooper&quot;, &quot;Fight of Icarus&quot; or &quot;Aces High&quot;, which Dickenson cannot handle on the vocals live as well as he can in the studio.  But it is great for disc two, which has &quot;Wrathchild&quot;, &quot;22 Acadia Avenue&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;.  I really like disc two and a few of the versions on disc one.  Overall, it's worthwhile but don't think that this is the only sampling of the band that you will want to have.  Also, anything produced by Martin Birch is going to good.  Who's he working with these days?  That's what I'd like to know, because everything new is junk.
B000127LW2|4.0|I have all 40 DVDs of Star Trek (original series), all seven box sets of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and all seven box sets of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...along with all 10 movies on DVD. I'm glad to see that Star Trek: Voyager is now coming out on DVD and is following the other boxed sets with a lot of extras. This is the last series worth getting on DVD. \\"Enterprise\\" is by far the worst sci-fi television show ever devised and is not worthy of the \\"Star Trek\\" name. Anyone who thinks it is \\"excellent\\" or \\"the best of the series\\" is too young, too naive, and too used to CGI effects instead of good stories and characters to understand the true nature of Star Trek. The other four series are great works and worthy of any TRUE Star Trek fan's DVD collection. Spend the money in 2004 to complete your collection and be content with that. When \\"Enterprise\\" comes out on DVD, I won't even waste my time even picking it up to look at the package design.
B000001DVD|5.0|Forget about the new junk like &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Slang&quot;.  What a ridiculous attempt at trying to please thirteen year old girls.  This is where Def Leppard got their reputation of writing hot melodies with an uncompromising kick.  Many great moments on this one.  This, Pyromania and Hysteria are their best albums.  The later stuff is marred by the obvious sappy appeal to the &quot;new&quot; radio listener and his/her nebulous mindset towards &quot;art rock&quot;.  These people are not real fans and will jump ship with the endless eb and flow.  Give me a freakin' break, just make some good rock'n roll music, okay?
B00005JL3A|5.0|Now this movies not really scary at all,but it has a great creepy feel to it,the drama,the action,the eye candy,the special effects,the great acting,the good sound track,and still one reviewer compared the film to Ghost's of Mars,and Terminator 3 when it's a totally different film,and story,and everything,they might have a slightly simular feel,but that's absolutely it.I wouldn't say it's better,but it's sure as heck isn't worse.And I've played the game,they alway's give the control rating a three out of five when it should be a one or less.Come on,when you push foreward you'r character walks backward's,I HATE THAT!Plus the game is boring,the great story line that no screen writer or director can supposedly match,is totally slow,and boring.About a quarter through the game I wished all the good guy's would of been eatin alive.That would of been a heck of alot more interesting than the super duper slow unfolding storyline.<br />            Now the movie on the other hand was the total opposite,it was really intriging,and exciting,from the very beginning,and lasted to the end.Plus it has a rock hard,not slow at all,not boring at all,storyline.In the game they don't explain absolutely nothing  right off,it's all in tiny,tiny incraments.That Sucks!It's like a long dull puzzle that just get's duller as the game progresses,and I don't really care where there going with the storyline in the first place.It goes like this,,,you start off in a mansion,with barely any knowledge of why you're there in the first place,,(you could tell the writers had to rack their brains on that one).Then you kill a zombie,and you think,why are there zombie's to begin with?Well it's because they wanted to put something really outlandish in the mansion that shouldn't be there to remind all the R.E. player's of a really badly written low budget cheesy B horror film,and it worked.<br />        But wait!Can it be?There's a small,very small clue,written on a paper.Once again,there's no explanation atall about much of anything on the paper,I'm falling asleep just thinking about it,now that's extremely unlike the movie.In the movie there's never a dull moment,there's Zombie dogs,a dicapitation,regular zombies that had a very well written reason for becoming zombies,they tell you that in about the middle of the film.I personally can't see how anyone could possably hate this film,unless they have very dry and boring taste.Well anyway's I highly recommend this movie....
B0000DD7NL|3.0|At first listen, I find myself a bit struck at the lack of tracks that articulate and deal with the nuances of life and its travails outside of the realm of amorous relationships. This type of song, for me, is what distinguished Songs in A Minor from the usual &quot;lovey-dovey&quot; dreck of Keys' contemporaries. Keys, in largely confining the topics addressed in Diary to plain love songs (excepting one track, shoved behind the album's 14 other tracks), reveals only her amorous side. Thus, little else of her personality comes across in this collection, and what is a diary if not personal?<br />With respect to her vocal delivery on this album, it seems to fall short of the preceding album wherein Keys utilized all sorts of textures of her voice, and varied her singing style from track to track. In Diary, however, the vocals are much less adventurous, and almost every track is sung in more or less the same tone and voice, belying Keys' ability and range as a vocalist.<br />Aside from these two gripes, Diary is a solidly good album. If it had been her debut (i.e. if I didn't know she could do better), it would have earned five stars from this amateur reviewer. It's musically adventurous with its paeans to funk, disco, and classic 70's soul. Keys' frank, smart, and contemporarily flavored (i.e. 2003 street) lyrics lend a freshness to the album that elevates it from the retro-land in which it might have otherwise resided. I love Miss Keys, and that's why I'm kinda' disappointed with this album. I want to know more about her, not about her man.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I found what I've been looking for in this album- hard, dark, fast, heavy, well balanced, and crazy talented.  With all the jerks out there singing like crap in what could be killer metal bands, I've grown accustomed to tuning-out the vocals and spending 15 bucks on a disc for 2, maybe 3 good songs,... tops.  They're bringing it on every song- there's no crap or lazyness.  Some bands have good first albums, but when it's time to develop some new material, the passion fades- more and more water in the whisky.  These guys really grew from their first offering (also pretty sik) and the live show is as impressive as Fear Factory ever was.  If you're from the FF, V.O.D., Sepultura days & don't dig the nu-metal weenies or wanna wade into the truly death metal side of the pool- try this out
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I have listened DT since IAW came out, and I have all album they've made. ToT is just a bunch of guys showing off their skills. Compared to IAW &amp; SFAM, they are losing their sense of art.
B0000TB03W|5.0|We all were glad to hear Shania was coming back but what we did not expect was the biggest loudest bang one could hear when she came back. Shania caught us all unaware I think with the quailty of this DVD. The sharpness and clear full voice to the beauty of Shania is all on this DVD. It is a DVD that we all need to have in our collection if we call ourselves Shania fans. She has come back and at least I say Welcome back and thanks for such a great DVD with the best music I have heard in sometime.
0679735259|5.0|I used to tell people that this was the best book I've ever read. Period. And I think it still is. Michael Herr writes fast-paced, razor sharp prose; his writing style has had an enormous influence on my poetry, believe it or not. Herr is THAT good. His book about Stanley kubrick is just as good as this one.
B00006879E|5.0|This is what a band should sound like, this is the backstreet boys with talet as opposed to marketing. I found that every track was good and had it's own sound, not that Boy band rubber stamp that 16 year old girl seem to like. I am a 46 year old male music lover from Pachebel to Elvis to Nat &quot;king&quot; Cole to Telonius Monk, and I give this CD a hardy endorsement. Bravo<BR>   Chasby Jones
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I have to confess, I wasn't sure if Mrs. Keys could match Songs In A Minor as most have failed to repeat such success with their 2nd album. BOY DID SHE PROVE ME WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is definately a lot of growth on this album. This is not your typical R&amp;B record, each song actually has meaning and not just a beat to dance to. It is very intimate, if you take away the music and listen to the words this album will definately touch your heart (That is if you are human :-). Although I love all of the songs, my favorites would have to be 'Diary', 'If I Ain't Got U', and 'When U Really Love Someone'. The lyrics are absolutely amazing and heartfelt.
0425170349|3.0|a reasonably written book, it certainly had me turning the pages. unfortunately, it closed off quite poorly.<BR>*slight spoiler*<BR>i just can't believe the ending - the &quot;bad guys&quot; (actually, i have far more sympathy for them than for the rainbow crew) just gave up. just like that. ten years, billions of dollars, and they just threw it all in the incinerator. no plan &quot;b&quot;. no recovery attempt. nothing.<BR>no - that is quite unrealistic...

B000089A07|4.0|Okay, I'm a huge fan of Thomas Harris, and I loved the movie Silence of the Lambs.  Any film following that is going to have big shoes to fill.  That being said, the Red Dragon does a reasonably good job.<br />A couple points.  Yes... I have read several reviews saying that this is very similar to Manhunter (which I have not seen).  But, since this movie is based upon the same book that Manhunter was, should it be any surprise that it is similar?  It's the same story people!  If you are looking for a surprise twist, maybe you should rent another movie!  <br />I will agree, however, that Ed Norton is probably not the man to play Will Graham.  I think Norton is a fantastic actor as seen in his potrayal in American History X and Primal Fear; but, as a man who is supposed to be an older experienced cop, who loves to hate investigating serial killers, Norton falls short.  Also, while I enjoy seeing Anthony Hopkins play Hannibal Lector, his part in the book is minimal, and it is overdone in the movie to please the Silence fans. <br />All in all, it is a good adaptation of the book.  Could it have been done better?  Probably.  If your looking to be entertained on a Friday night, will it do?  Yes.  As long as you aren't looking to be blown away, you'll be pleased with the Red Dragon.  It's a psychological thriller, but keep in mind, it was Harris' first book.  If you don't try to make it live up to Silence you shouldn't be disappointed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|What a brilliant voice! I never was into pop music. I'm more of a goth/rock/metal kind of chick, but when I heard \\"Fighter\\" and \\"beautiful\\" on Launch, I fell in love and decided to buy the album. One of the best CD's I bought this year. Better then Marilyn Manson Golden age of Grotesque, which was a waste of my money.<br />Christina Aguilera's raunchy, sexy, dark and over-the-top look has turned many older fans away, while turning on the younger generation. But her new album, \\"Stripped,\\" is nothing short of spectacular. While attracting much media attention with her new style and lack of clothing, Aguilera is still able to showcase her true talent in this CD that was three years in the making. With this, her sophomore record, she throws aside the innocent teenybop-princess act and goes for the real thing, adding a sexy twist while making genuine music.<br />Each song shines light on her personality, including her rocky past, by focusing on some touchy subjects (her abusive father and failed relationships). The songs range from upbeat dance tracks (the girl-power anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\") to the sad and revealing \\"I'm OK.\\" But \\"Stripped\\" has received much criticism for displaying a pessimistic outlook.<br />Aguilera is really singing to teach people what she has learned the hard way, which is evident in the \\"Soar\\" lyrics: \\"Don't be scared/To fly alone/-Find a path that is your own/ Love will open every door.\\" Aguilera also warns her audience to \\"trust the voice within.\\" This same feeling comes through in \\"Fighter\\" with the chorus \\"'Cause it makes me that much stronger/Makes me work a little bit harder ... So thanks for making me a fighter.\\" Critics see these lyrics as angry and revengeful, but really, she is revealing her true emotions which allows other teenagers to identify with her, something that was nearly impossible with the old squeaky-clean Christina.<br />With \\"Stripped,\\" Aguilera does break the mold, both musically and stylistically, making people almost afraid to like (or buy) her music, which results in critics dumping on her, creating an endless circle of hate, negative media attention, and often awkwardness toward the new \\"XXXtina\\" Aguilera.<br />If one can step away from the vulgar new image, defending her is quite simple, for critics are interpreting songs to mean things they do not, and completely twisting them around. A closer, more accurate examination reveals that the variety of themes here should keep the audience intrigued, if nothing else. \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Infatuation\\" are not meant to be serious tracks- they are dance songs. \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Singin' My Song\\" should not be criticized for their lack of vocal power. These tracks are inspirational, and uplifting.<br />Aguilera's powerful range of music motivates, teaches, and most important, entertains. For these reasons alone, \\"Stripped\\" should be praised.<br />Christina has a new fan with me!most afraid to like (or buy) her music, which results in critics dumping on her, creating an endless circle of hate, negative media attention, and often awkwardness toward the new \\"XXXtina\\" Aguilera. <br />If one can step away from the vulgar new image, defending her is quite simple, for critics are interpreting songs to mean things they do not, and completely twisting them around.

0792165020|1.0|I'm reading through these reviews, and wondering if I watched the same movie as the others.  I HATED this movie!  It was terribly slow, and at the end I looked up and said, &quot;oh, it's over?&quot;  I couldn't believe it ended the way it did.  The movie is ridiculous.  Totally pointless.  Yes, the cinematography was amazing.  Wonderful.  The acting was decent.  There just wasn't much there.  I love Matt Damon, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman.  I just hated this movie.  It was painful to watch.  It is probably the worst movie I have seen since &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot;  I'd recommend you not waste your time.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain's star still shines bright with her new DVD released last month. The concert is basically the one shown on NBC but with a few extras. I enjoyed it and continue to.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This movie is truly beautiful.  Yes, I love Shakespeare anyway; so, perhaps I am biased in that regard.  But, the story intertwines Will Shakespeare's personal life (falling in and out of love continuously, and then eventually falling in love with Viola - aka Gwyneth Paltrow) and his writing (and directing) Romeo and Juliet.  The movie is truly breathtaking, as you watch the unfolding of Viola and Will's relationship.  I didn't want the movie to end.  I highly recommend &quot;Shakespeare in Love.&quot;  It was a lovely change of pace from the typical hollywood &quot;shoot 'em up&quot; movie.  Just fabulous!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania truly is an artist. You will be happy with this dvd purchase!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've had Stripped for more than a year now and i've listenned to it a BILLION times already! Still, the record sounds amazing everytime i play it on my stereo!<BR>When i first bought her sophomore album, i was expecting the same bubblegum pop maybe with a little edge to it. I was 15 at the time, and was still very much into the whole 'POP' scene. I honestly did not expect such a different sound from Ms. Aguilera. When i listenned to it for the first time, i was quite dissapointed. I couldn't relate to the lyrics of course, because it was sexually explicit and most of them are personal to Christina. It really has nothing to do with the normal things that teenagers are facing in their daily lives. But, what i did like about the album at first was the fact that it was so easy for me to differentshade the songs. That made me realize that this album was clearly well thought-of. <BR>So, i gave it another go and another and another one, until i became literally obsessed with the album. Honestly, i listenned to it all the time!!!I didn't play any of the albums that i had of her and other singers, because i just couldn't get enough of 'Stripped'. <BR>I loved 'Can't Hold Us Down' at first listen. It makes me feel very strong and powerful about myself, and believing that i can be on the same level as men. 'Get Mine,Get Yours' is another favourite of mine, though i wouldn't mine singing along to it, if it hadn't been for the very sexual lyrics. <BR>'Impossible' opened me up to Alicia Keys, and now, i would call myself a fan of Ms.Keys too, all thanks to XTina. <BR>The songs which i am not so keen on are 'Walk Away'(too slow), 'Beautiful' (too draggy), 'Make Me Over'(hate the screaming!) and 'Keep On Singing My Song' (too long)<BR>'The Voice Within' is great song, but i think Christina oversang. Her ad-lib was TOO MUCH! Her ad-lib was supposed to compliment the song, but everyone knows that Too Much of Anything is Always Bad.<BR>Christina didn't lose her fans, infact she gainedmore. Creativity and Originality are what appeal to people.
B0000TB03W|5.0|After a brief hiatus of creating a family and working on new songs with her ellusive husband, Mutt, Shania has come back strong,both vocally and lyrically. And she hasn't skimped on the entertainment factor either. In fact, Shania seems to be almost basking in her newfound live show lights on this DVD, titled, UP! Respectively so titled UP! with it's upbeat attitude it certainly reflects on the listener/viewer as well. Watch and your attitude will be uplifted too. Enjoy!!
B00005N91B|5.0|I realized that I had in fact not actually seen this film when I watched it early last night.  I think I must have just seen scenes when I was younger and assumed I had seen the whole thing.  There a great deal of gratuitous sex in this film, but there is also a quite a good deal of suspense and old school tension that used to be found in the noir thrillers of the 30's and 40's.  I loved Sharon Stone in this.  I can now see why she became a star so quickly.  Michael Douglas is always good so his brilliant performance wasn't a surprise to me.  But the real standout for me was actually Jeanne Tripplehorn.  She was incredible.  Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite filmmakers at the moment.  He has made so versatile films everything from medieval (i.e. Flesh and Blood) to science fiction (i.e. Starship Troopers, Robocop and Total Recall), sexual thrillers (The 4th Man, Basic Instinct and Showgirls), horror films (i.e. Hollow Man), and war films (i.e. Soldier of Orange).  He is a brilliant filmmaker who deserves much more attention.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This new DVD, UP! is one you will watch again and again. Shania's stage presence and vocal skills make this DVD one you will watch again and again. Worth the money.

B00006ZCFH|3.0|Erykah Badu has always been at the forefront of the &quot;neo-soul&quot; music movement and I have been an avid fan since On and On.  She has always had the ability to mix the organic with the spiritual and the ethereal, creating a unique yet relatable sound that seems timeless.  Even today I still listen to the first, second, and live cd back to back with each time I discover something new and profound. Her new cd however, does nothing for me.  The initial track is classic Badu and I thought it would set a tone for her metamorphosis.  The songs that follow save for maybe two or three are a waste of space.  The intros are to long and lyrics are rather repetitive and simplistic.  Usually that can me that there is some deep significance but in this case there isn't.  It's as if she couldn't think of something else to say which I'm shocked since previous albums were chocked full of knowledge.  Not only do you just want to fast forward the track to the point of the song but you tend to think &quot;now where have I heard this before.&quot;  In my opinion the cd itself has too much of a Common influence and although he's bad in his own right, the two should not meet/collaborate. I'm just hoping this is an intermission album that will eventually yield a cd that fans are use to and expect from such an amazing artist.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania ROCKS witht the best of them on her new DVD UP!!! A must for the Shania fan on your XMAS list.
1401200524|5.0|I wanted to give some information about the &quot;Absolute Edition&quot; of this book, because the listing here doesn't really tell you anything about it.  The &quot;Absolute Edition&quot; is the one with the $75 list price.  It features two oversized books in a sturdy slipcase.  The first book is the acclaimed League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Vol. 1 comic book series that has been printed in a few other forms, although this version is printed much larger.  The second book contains Alan Moore's scripts for the comic book series.  If you enjoyed the comic book series and can't get enough of it, this book is for you.  I was amazed at how detailed the scripts were.  He gives camera angles and everything for virtually every panel in the comic.  This is the ultimate version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

0793518326|5.0|Finally!!! The Holy Grail of rock music arrived on my doorstep, unlocking many of the musical and lyrical mysteries of The Beatles' music that had kept me guessing for the past 30 years!!<br />All of the songs are here and are arranged in alphabetical order -- a much more user-friendly arrangement than publications that group songs by album or release date. The ONLY complaint I have with this particular publication is with the SIZE of the book.<br />I wish the publisher would've used a LARGER page size, one more in keeping with the standard size of most printed sheet music.  Due to the fact that a smaller page size was used, each song requires multiple pages for transcription, causing the book to be quite THICK.  It is SO thick, in fact, that trying to use this book atop a music stand is a difficult task, indeed!<br />Perhaps the publishers might consider printing a 2nd edition, with larger pages next time around.  Larger type would also be welcomed.<br />Put this book at the top of your &quot;must have&quot; list!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Two thumbs up for up, shania's new released dvd recorded live in Chicago. You will like it.
B000002GC2|5.0|The title of the first track \\"Ai no corrida\\" is the title of a Japanese (sort-of-XXX) movie also known as \\"Realm of Senses\\" in english. This movie tells the story of a growing sex obsession between a woman and her lover. It seems that the atmosphere that the film describes was the inspiration for the song.
B00000JTB2|5.0|I'll keep it short and simple.  This is one of the best discs I've ever heard; definitely in my top 5.  The vocal exchanges between the two is both humorous and insightful.  These men played out of passion for the music and that comes out of every song.  This disc never gets tiring and it's especially fun to listen to while I'm working out.  This is music at it's most emotional and heartfelt finest.  It doesn't get any better than this!
B000002UJQ|5.0|When i bought this album in 1999, it was only because i liked the song 'karma police'. So i listened to that one and it sat in my cd rack *literally* *unheard* for three years... until the start of 2003.. when i decided to give it a try.<br />how stupid was i to not listen to it before now?! I really can't reccomend this album enough. it is simply excellent. with all my other albums, maybe i will like a few of the songs on it and it will get boring after a while, but this! i love ALL of the songs on here, althoug a few take a while to get used to (the tourist, climbing up the walls.. but theyre great anyway!) and its about all i listen to atm. <br />the sheer depth of this album makes everything else pale into insignificance. The songs are well balanced and emotional, listening to the whole album all the way through will certainly make your mood change. The unconventional approach they take is also excellent, tending to stray away from other more 'me too' bands.<br />Honestly cant reccomend it enough.
0156029065|5.0|This is my first exposure to Eco's work, but definately not my last. I found Baudolino to be hugely entertaining. Eco is a master storyteller with an attention to detail that brings his characters alive. His humor is subtle, to be sure, but it is ever-present nonetheless. Eco has a unique feel for the times which is another gift he has for making this book come to life for the reader. <br />Highly recommended. 5+stars!
B0000C8AVR|4.0|yeah thats me somewhere on Desolation Row, this song alone makes this a great Album. I think desolation row is a place I think we are all in tune with sometimes. Dylan is trying to let us know that we are all part of the same heap of rubbish lining the sidewalks of desolation row. Or no matter how much you think you got it made , you will still end up licking your wounds like a dejected dog down some lonely dark stank alleyway.<BR>This Dylan guy goes really deep with his music. I would love to sit down with him and find out whats going on inside his head when he comes up with all this stuff! Highway 61 revisited is a good album.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This CD needed a few rotations in my player in order for me to really start to like it. I've been a fan since her first album and it's been nice to see her progression. I'm not sure if this album is too much of an attempt for her to try to discard her teen idol image because nearly every song is about sex or partying. It's no mystery that she has a terrible voice but she's an all-around performer and she usually chooses songs that suit her vocal abilities. However, this CD is very breathy and she speaks on most of the tracks and truth be told, her voice is quite annoying, so the conclusion is that this probably needs to be one of her last CDs if not the last. She sounds too much like Madonna, Kylie Minogue, and even Hilary Duff on this album.  If you want a fun CD, buy it, but if you're looking for this phenomenal album with amazing lyrical content and exceptional vocal skills, go buy Christina's \\"Stripped.\\" Here's a song by song review (1-lowest, 5 highest):<BR> <BR>Me Against The Music: 4, I LOATHED this song when I first heard it, but it grew on me like a bad fungus and I can't stop singing it.<BR> <BR>I Got That (Boom Boom): 3.5, it's a guilty pleasure. I'm a big hip hop/rap fan and I can't help but love the Ying Yang Twins. A huge surprise track, never expected them to hook up. It's too sugary pop for them and it's too rough for her. But I sing it every time.<BR> <BR>Showdown: 4, very sexual, the lyrics are hot, interesting production.<BR> <BR>Breathe on Me: 4, Sounds like something Kylie Minogue would sing. But Kylie's cool, so. <br />Early Mornin: 4, a party girl's anthem about being a nightcrawler and hooking up with a guy. Moby produced the song and I enjoy it.<br />Toxic: 5, this is a song that you'd expect from Britney all grown up. One of the more \\"pop\\" songs on the album, wh/is not why I like it, because I prefer the more RnB Britney. You can't help but dance around and belt out the lyrics.<br />Outrageous: 5, R. Kelly's production, a masterpiece as usual. Lyrics are very superficial, about how everything in her life (clothes, car, body) is outrageous. Feel good song.<br />Touch of My Hand: 3, the \\"self love\\" song. For a song about playing with yourself, it's so melodic that you almost forget about the lyrical content. I usually stop listening to the CD after Outrageous, but once in a while I listen to this song. And then I officially stop.<br />The Hook Up: 2, her attempt to capitalize on the new dancehall reggae trend. She needs to try again.<br />Shadow: 2, sounds like a song Kelly Clarkson passed up. Britney should've too.<br />Brave New Girl: 2, sounds like an old Madonna song meets Lizzie McGuire. She need not ever do a song like this.<br />Everytime: 2.5, the song dedicated to Justin. Slow, melodic, very nice if you're in the mood. Which I'm usually not. <br />Me Against The Music Remix: 3, at first I liked this song more than the original, but now it's almost annoying. I prefer the original.<br />Anyway, I hope this helped you in your decision to buy the album!
B00005MP58|5.0|Fabulous if you loved it on tv owning the dvd is even better!  Great quality.
B0000TB03W|5.0|WOMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD NEED TO SEE THIS DVD,BECAUSE IT IS SO UPLIFTING TO ALL WOMEN. MEN NEED TO SEE THIS TOO. THIS IS THE BEST I'VE SEE IN ALONG TOME.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I just wanted to point out to fans of &quot;Star Trek, The Next Generation&quot; that there's an interesting surprise in the behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD.  Hint:  The Dancing Doctor.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|i think that songs #4 and 5 are the best-after that theyre all good
B000002H33|5.0|What can I say? This is an *EXCELLENT* album. If you're just getting into Metallica, I highly recommend getting this as their first album, like I did. There is not one bad song on here.<br />Battery - starts out soft and acoustic, but don't be fooled, thirty seconds in it gets heavy, and then about a minute into the song it starts getting really fast. Excellent song. 5/5<br />Master of Puppets - Long, but still great. Has two awesome guitar solos. 5/5<br />The Thing That Should Not Be - Based on the H.P. Lovecraft story &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot;. A bit slow, but still great nonetheless. 5/5<br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - Excellent song. I love the solos in this one. 5/5<br />Disposable Heroes - Another long song. This one's based on war. Very fast and very heavy. 5/5<br />Leper Messiah - Slower than Disposable Heroes, but still very heavy. 5/5<br />Orion - Excellent instrumental. Beautiful piece of music! 5/5<br />Damage Inc. - The shortest song on the album, but probably the heaviest and fastest. The solo in this one is INSANE! 5/5<br />This is definitely one of the best thrash albums of all time, and probably Metallica's best. If you're a fan of metal and you don't have this one yet, GET IT!
B00007E8V4|5.0|GREAT ALBUM!<br />But they werent all rejects. Half of them were internet leaks. They wanted money from the leaks without sueing so they pieced it together.
0030514924|5.0|This is a great book by Charles DIckens. It shows you that no matter how people are to you be nice to them. One day htey might turn around if u just keep encouraging them. Just because there a bad person dont mean u have to be. So if u wanna be like scrooge go ahead, but i wouldnt reccomend it.
B00000064G|5.0|I flinch as I glance at the &quot;related artists&quot; category.  All dead young men.  While the music of Elliot Smith, Jeff Buckley, and Nick Drake are deservedly hailed posthumously, they are hardly related.  Perhpas it is the mystery of their lives and deaths that lend a certain mystique to their work.  <BR>And it would be hard to listen to Pink Moon and not feel some of that vibe working through it.  Pink Moon is one of the moodiest and subdued albums you could ever hear, but it is also one of the richest and most beautiful.  For all intents and purposes, it is a solo album of just acoustic guitar and vocals.  Yet being so stripped down instrumentally and emotionally naked, Drake is able to do more with this sparse setup than many have done with a wall of sound.  Like the greates jazz recordings, Pink Moon is done with nothing more than the performer and the vibe in the room.  What comes out is a piece of pure truth.<BR>Drake's guitar lines borrow from classical melodies and folk stylings spliced with his experimental tunings, lending to the unique sound.  His voice is high and soft at the same time, breathing the words across the deep tones of his guitar lines.  The simplicity of the melodies provide the perfect carrier of Drakes lines of sadness; taking on a world that does not seem real, contemplating loneliness, happiness, love, and melancholy moods.  <BR>One cannot thank Drake enough for his gift, and one way to do that is to go out and discover those artists who still live and can still create their music.
B00006V9A0|5.0|i love nirvana it`s was the first time i herd them and i fell in love my favorite song of the album unplugged in new york is the man who sold the world i think that nirvana is very rexlaing!
B000003489|4.0|I consider this the first truly essential John Coltrane album, along with his work alongside Miles Davis on the seminal Kind of Blue.  It is here that John Coltrane establishes himself as the unprecedent artist that he was.  It is on Giant Steps that we find the first essential statement of Coltrane's musical personality.  <BR>This recording starts at a breakneck jazz tempo, and hardly lets up throughout the course of its seven tracks.  Coltrane's saxaphone explodes through the speakers, in a barrage of notes and bright tones that convey the sheer electricity of all that is possible in jazz music.  <BR>This blizzard of sound would quickly grow tiresome, if it weren't for the subtle variations in composition.  After the intensity of Giant Steps, Cousin Mary steps up and bounces a little more emphatically, letting Coltrane loosen up and take the groove to incredible heights.  <BR>Syeeda's Song Flute similarly finds a way to groove, with more moodiness and cool.  The track Naima is the albums only quiet moment, letting Coltrane float his melody into the far reaches of a saxaphone's range, without flash, and with pure feeling.  The album ends emphatically with Mr. P.C., showcasing the session musicians in its incredible bursts of drum solos and driving instrumentation.  <BR>You don't have to know the details of jazz to get this recording.  What makes John Coltrane so special is his ability to communicate through sound, rendering reviews such as this useless.  This is a great place to start building a Coltrane collection, or any jazz collection.
B00006G8G4|5.0|One of the most important things for taken a comic book to the big screen is that the director.  It's shows by this movie.  There are a couple &quot;creative licenses&quot; but not enough for the die hard fans to scream.  Toby is a great Peter Parker.  I didn't care for Kirstin Dunst.  Willem Dafoe did a great job as the Green Goblin.  Could be over the top but the scene with the mirror defined the character!  Surprising fun was<br />J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.  He was everything you would imagine about the character!<br />If you are a big fan then this set is great for the extras.<br />A great film and you won't tire watching it!
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is a mix of Drama and action, all mixed up together alright, this is a very good
B0000E1WKE|3.0|I'm not going to say this is a fabulous CD like many reviewers have already said.  This CD is GOOD, nothing more and nothing less.  Yeah, she DID over-sing the classic Christmas songs, and that's kind of disappointing.  I love listening to new versions of classics, but her versions were a little over the top.  BUT I will say that I do enjoy listening to this album.  The songs are well-produced and her voice, although not at the top of her game, is still very beautiful.<br />If you want another Christmas CD to play at parties or just in the car for a little while, this one is good, but if you are looking for a Christmas CD that you will continue to pull out in years to come, KEEP LOOKING!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|THIS CD IS GREAT!    I LIKE EVERY SONG BEGINNING TO END .EVERYONE SHOULD CONSIDER PURCHASING THIS CD.
B000002572|5.0|In the 1970's, their where many hard rock/heavy metal albums that defined the genre during that decade. This was one of the best. This album's quality is the only real reason Boston is remembered so well today, as they have had a spotty career.<br />The band put together clean, fresh melodies and created some of the best sounding hard rock in history. Most bands had one or two hits per album, and then a few album track gems. Boston's entire debut was exciting and fresh. It was the best hard rock album of 1976, and there was some stiff competition. Aeromsmith released &quot;Rocks&quot; that year, often seen as their best album. Kiss put out &quot;Destroyer&quot;, which has also been hailed as their greatest piece of work. Boston however, beat them all out this year. Every song on this record was a radio hit, and is still on classic rock radio today.<br />If you love hard rock and heavy metal from the 1970's, you will worship this album. It is not overrated in the least. This is a fine album, and Boston, while they would have a decent following album, would never reach this status again.
B00000269G|4.0|This is the album that sparked my love for Erroll Garner's piano playing. Even at age 12, when I first bought this classic CD, I knew the sound quality could have been 10 times better. Yet Garner's performance was so amazing that I found myself playing it over and over again always finding something new and fresh particularly in his almost miraculous performances of &quot;I'll Remember April&quot;, his own spur-of-the-moment fast-paced, Latin jazz inspired &quot;Mambo Carmel&quot;, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and &quot;April in Paris&quot;. Although these happen to be the most transcending and uplifting moments of the program, there are other great swinging versions of Cole Porter's &quot;It's All Right With Me&quot; and Rodgers and Hart's &quot;Where or When&quot;.  What one will discover immediately in this classic performance is Garner's seemingly inexhaustible inspiration filled to the brim with an infectious joie de vivre that was all his own. A must have in spite of the terribly mediocre remastering it received. 4 and a half stars.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Now i have listened to a lot of music.  But as far as death metal goes, this is probably as good as your going to get.  Some people don't give this group enough credit.  They have come up with newer styles each time, considering the fans don't give them much leway in what they write.
B000002KDB|5.0|Emmylou was a delightful discovery nearly 30 years ago, and her first album remains a joy. Before she started experimenting with different genres several albums down the road, before age took a toll on her voice and she adapted with grace, producing masterpieces like &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;, there was this pure clean gorgeous voice like no other. And there was a unique sound that hit the ground running here, with a perfect album in which every song was a solid winner.<br />This isn't today's &quot;alt-country&quot;, and indeed it may well be more country than some of Emmylou's 21st-century fans are comfortable with. Back in the day, we hippie sorts had nothing to do with official country music, and the official world of country music would have nothing to do with Emmylou. She was nowhere near to moving to Nashville yet, and was played on the same FM stations that played rock music.  Her music was a continuation of music we then put in the country-rock genre, which was considered every bit as cool as any other sort of rock in the early 70's.  In a rock historian's book, maybe the driving force was Gram Parsons joining the Byrds and helping create their &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album. But out in the real world, no one had heard of Gram Parsons, was unlikely to have heard more than a song or two from that album, and what brought country-rock into our worlds were later incarnations of the Byrds, Bob Dylan doing &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, and lesser bands like New Riders of the Purple Sage or Commander Cody. Those are the sounds that primed us for the far more enduring music of Emmylou Harris.<br />Without denying Gram Parsons his due, he is known today largely because of the work Emmylou Harris started so brilliantly here. Some have said below that her covers of other people's songs were often superior to the originals, and I agree. I'll go a step farther and say that it's her covers of music that Parsons wrote or loved that not only put it on the map,but that made it sound good enough for it to acquire what eventually became a huge audience. I don't think that detracts from his talents, but it speaks to the beauty of her voice and the arrangements and production on this album and those that followed.<br />Listening to this CD decades later, it is striking how country it is, and hard to remember how easily we accepted this music in the rock world way back when. It's nearly as hard to imagine why her work wasn't accepted at the time by the country audience. And nowadays, when her voice is an entirely different sort of instrument, it's impossible to imagine why reviewers at the time thought her voice wasn't strong enough for a solo artist, and that she was better suited to being a backup singer. Though I was a huge fan, I felt there was some truth to the criticisms, and what drew me in were her soft, unspeakably sweet, angelic interpretations of slower songs. Tastes were just so different then. Compared to all the lovely and popular, but much-weaker, girlish voices of today's alt-country world, the Emmylou of the 70's belted songs out with a voice whose strength I had nearly forgotten. It is stunning to listen to today, after years of spending much more time with Wrecking Ball. Emmylou really rocked country long before &quot;crossover&quot; was invented.<br />This is probably an essential Emmylou album for anyone who is a fan of her 70's and 80's work. If you're browsing because you have a love affair with Wrecking Ball or later work, this may not be your cup of tea. To those of us who were there, this is the voice we loved doing the music we loved, and represents Emmylou at her peak - or, rather, one of her many peaks.
6302237998|1.0|although i do agree with all the reviews below mine, i would have to say this movie freaking sucked. It is the abomination of the movie world. It should have never been created, I got this in my cereal box, yep i was pouring my fruity lucks when this dvd popped into my cerial bowl. I tryed biting it to see if it was candy, but to no avail it was actually the dvd. I was so disappointed i decide to watch it, I thought i might get a good laugh out of how corny and cheesey... mmm. cheese... I want popcorn. THe movie actually scared me, and i had to go to the store to buy beer, and asprin. I then went to a party and talked about how bad this movie was. then i talked to alpha571 about it. I couldn't believe that there was a movie with russel crowe in it, where he wasn't yelling. Anyway, i liked the part in the movie where they died. that was the only funny part and they should have ended it there. good night everybody!
B00003CXRM|5.0|After The Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers refined their approach to movie-making. They stuck with the idea of including any idea that was funny and slightly strange, but this time they imposed a plot that made sense. Like Fargo --- which was supposed to be based on a true story but really wasn't --- Oh Brother Where Art Thou is based on the Odyssey (a seemingly true story that they could use when it served them, or dump when it didn't). Then they  added the Depression, southern politics, and lots of music.<br />If this had been written and directed by anyone else, it would have been a mess. But with the Coen brothers, it's a musical comedy disguised as a screwball period piece. It helps that the casting is perfect. From the three principal actors to the major secondary characters (like John Goodman's Big Dan Teague/Cyclops) to the smaller parts (like the governor's two dim-bulb campaign managers and the radio station owner) every actor is funny and perfectly in sync with the tone of the film.<br />The Coens added quite a bit of computer effects and all of it works. The obvious example is the color-grading. The short documentary on the DVD shows how computers were used to wash out colors and tint different scenes. Then there are small parts, such as the underwater shot of Dapper Dan cans and a dog floating  by. Those cans are computer-generated, and the dog was composited into the shot. You don't notice this stuff until the third or fourth time you see it. Once you notice, it makes the movie even better.<br />This is one of the best Coen brothers movies, and one of the best movies of the last 10 years. The music is so good, you'll be humming every tune the day after you see it. It's very funny and beautifully designed, as well.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I saw Pink before she made it big, years ago. She was opening for the band we were there to see.  I remember turning to my friends and we all laughed at how bad she was....  And what was with the pink hair?  Prancing around the stage, acting like a fool.....<br />Well, it is maybe four years later, and all I can say is that Pink ROCKS!  I like this one much better than Mizunderstood.  It is more adult and polished and her vocal stylings are more varied and interesting.<br />And, I normally don't like pop music, being much more of a rocker-type person, who listens to Pantera, Chevelle, Black Label Society, Spike1000, Linkin Park, Stepa, Blindside and others of that ilk.  <br />All I can say is that I really love this CD.  It makes me smile and I like to sing along.  I can't wait until she tours in San Francisco.  I would definitely see her live.  And not make fun of her.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This DVD is an amazing piece of work, if you weren't one of the 80,00+ people in the crowd this DVD will make if feel like you were there.  I don't think I have ever seen the Chilis live like this, nor have I ever seen a live music DVD like this.  It's just an amazing video, and it is ESSENTIAL for any Chili Pepper fan.  If you don't have this BUY IT!
B00006690G|4.0|I liked Eminem when he first came out. I liked the radio dub of &quot;My Name Is&quot;. I thought it was one of the funniest raps ever to come out. ... Then, not withstanding that Eminem had some harsh/violent things to say lyrically, I continued to enjoy his skills and sense of humor into Marshal Mathers. MMLP is a very great album (lyrically and musically), minus the crazed-insanity type raps in a couple songs. Basically I regard Eminem as a greatly skilled rapper who is a touch too negative at times. I listened to the EminemShow in the music store when it came out. I wasn't very impressed. I liked the popular songs, and that's it. The other tracks seemed boring to me. Then (after a couple months), because my wife is a big Eminem fan too, we bought the cd anyway. Mostly only my wife listened to it. Now I've started to listen to it because I completely love Square Dance! <BR>And now I've heard what I think is one of the funniest rap lines of all time! In the song &quot;My Dad's Gone Crazy&quot;. It's the line that begins &quot;It's like my mother always told me...&quot;. Cute song.<br />Nice album.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Yes, I have to admit it. I can see why some of Sarah Mclachlan's die hard fans were disappointed by this album. This is not the same Sarah of Solace or of Surfacing. But it is still Sarah none the less. Her tenure as an artist has given her a new sense of self leaving her bold enough to try some new things. While the lyrically simple and overly pop-sounding Train Wreck and Stupid leave something to be desired, her bold new sound does provides amazing songs such as Fallen, World on Fire, and Time. When you try something new there are usually hits and misses, as there are in this album. And when you are overly comfortable with an artist, it can be difficult to adapt to their changes. Some of the tracks do take some listening to get used to, but like I said before, this is still Sarah. And anyone who enjoys her distinctive voice and beautiful lyrics will be able to find more than enough on this album to keep them listening for more.
0767811070|5.0|When I think of so called &quot;hood&quot; movies, Menace II Society and this come up in my mind. But unlike Menace, I was really moved by this. A big reason is because you come to care for the characters. It has Characters that reflect on life in general. It has Characters that seek a better life. It has Characters that lose a loved one in a really tragic and ironic way. This movie was nominated for Best Orig. Screenplay and Director at the Oscars. But I think they should have went all out and nominated it for Best Picture because it was really one of the best films of the early nineties.

0393057658|4.0|This book was billed as some major expose on the inner workings and mind of Billy Beane - General Manager of the Oakland A's, and how he continues to make things work with no money against teams (mostly the Yankees) with significantly larger budgets.  And for the most part, that's what it did.<br />Did I enjoy this?  Absolutely yes - I totally enjoyed parts of it (the draft day stuff, Beane's behaviour in the park).  But other parts bored me.  For some reason we got an entire chapter on how A's pitcher Chad Bradford grew up as a kid.  That's fine and all, but I don't see how that was germaine to the book.  I also was a bit bored about Beane's time in the minors and what his life was like as a player.  Yeah, I understand it's background to why he does what he does now, but quite frankly, it bored me.<br />But once the book got out of that, it was wonderful!  Lots of insight into how a major league general manager's mind works - or at least Beane's.  I agree there's something to sabremetrics (sp?) and it certainly seems to work for him.  What I took away from this is that he seemed a bit naieve to think his way is the only way to do things, though.  Running has it's uses.  I get the impression that if he could, Beane would have every run scored on a bases loaded walk.  :)<br />However, that's a lot of nitpicking on my part - the book is an enjoyable read.  Provided you enjoy the &quot;business&quot; of baseball.  If you don't enjoy the biz side of the sport, you probably wouldn't enjoy this book.
B000000H66|5.0|I'm a fan of all types of rock/metal music, and let me say, Death's Symbolic is quite possibly one of the most amazing, beautiful, technical and intellegent albums ever recorded. First of all, Chuck's lyrics are nothing short of amazing. This guy is not only a poet, but a thinker. His lyrics are very thoughtful, and are pure emotion of general issues. The guitar playing is jaw dropping as well. Not only the sheer speed of them, but Chuck's solos are just so melodic and perfect. Next, we have the drums. Gene Holgan is inhuman, as he pounds the double bass at the perfect times and hits the skins. <br />Simply put, this album is perfect. It desevers all the stars in the world, because this is THE Death album to own. It gives me chills listening to it, and I listen to it a few times a week, and I've had it for a long while. This is essential. Chuck Shuldiner may be gone but never forgotten.
B0000TB03W|5.0|We all were glad to hear Shania was coming back but what we did not expect was the biggest loudest bang one could hear when she came back. Shania caught us all unaware I think with the quailty of this DVD. The sharpness and clear full voice to the beauty of Shania is all on this DVD. It is a DVD that we all need to have in our collection if we call ourselves Shania fans. She has come back and at least I say Welcome back and thanks for such a great DVD with the best music I have heard in sometime
6305665753|5.0|Hello, why isn't this on dvd yet?!! Amazon should have poll to tell the studios we're interested in this.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have been not been to any Shania concerts yet but the Chicago concert makes me wish I could have attended this one. Shania is SO full of energy, constantly moving, interacting with the crowd...it is fantastic to watch! And the audience! Wow are they hyper or what? Everyone on the dvd is extremely excited to see Shania's first concert in the US since 1999! The band is fabulous too! This concert just had so much energy and anyone that passes up this DVD doesn't know what they're missing! And yes, there are extra songs that Shania performed at Chicago that were not shown on the TV special 6 of them! So you're in for a real treat! I'm telling you, anyone would love this for a present and if there's no one to buy it for, then buy it for yourself because this is one awesome energy filled concert! Shania definitely rocks this country as will this dvd!
047158651X|1.0|This book is complete garbage, especially considering the price.  Explanations of relatively simple ideas are often made unnecessarily complicated.  A good deal of the writing is unnecessarily flowery, and sentence structure is quite often more complex than is necessary or desireable for a book of this sort.  I wasted an enormous amount of time rereading sections that turned out to be extremely confusing ways of explaining relatively uncomplicated concepts.  In my view, potentially confusing scientific concepts should be explained in the simplest possible way.  There's enough substance in the actual material that decorative language is definitely not necessary.  For the price, I would have expected better editing as well, quite a few noticeable typos (3rd edition Vol. 1).  I haven't read any biochem textbooks besides this one, but I'd recommend avoiding this one at all costs.
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you watched the special on NBC, you're gonna love the live DVD! It's got some songs not shown on TV and being able to watch Shania sing your favorite song over and over is a plus! this DVD a must-have for all Shania Twain fans
015626224X|4.0|Great Read! This book follows the aimless journeys of an unemployed journalist in Paris and London. Orwell presents a clear and honest view into the 'underworld' of these great metropolises. <BR>In traditional Orwellian style, this book flows; the writing style makes reading the book effortless. The anecdotes are entertaining and keep you reading for more. I think some of his longer expostulations into the evils of urban poverty were a bit overwrought, but it wouldn't have been Orwell without them. This book is heartily recommended.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has cut DVD that is up on top of the list. It is one that ya'll can live it up to. You want to get down and jam or you want to hold your loved one close or the one you want to love close. This DVD has it all for those who want to live it up or just slow it down. Shania Up Live in Chicago is a dancers and lovers DVD.
0316926345|4.0|This book is worth a read for one reason: Waugh skillfully portrays the dysfunctions and excesses of aristocratic British life. The evident futility of their lives is very poignantly expressed - Waugh's literary style seems to just ooze 'futility' and a sense of 'an end of an era'. <BR>That being said, I did not find the prose very fluid (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). I also do not generally like books where I'm left with a sense of loss and hopelessness. However, if you do like those types of books, then Waugh's poignancy is definitely not to be missed.
B0000TB03W|5.0|After a brief hiatus of creating a family and working on new songs with her ellusive husband, Mutt, Shania has come back strong,both vocally and lyrically. And she hasn't skimped on the entertainment factor either. In fact, Shania seems to be almost basking in her newfound live show lights on this DVD, titled, UP! Respectively so titled UP! with it's upbeat attitude it certainly reflects on the listener/viewer as well. Watch and your attitude will be uplifted too. Enjoy!!
B00000K19E|5.0|&quot;The Matrix&quot; was a real sleeper hit of 1999.  It is one of the few movies which incorporate a large amount of computer generated special effects and have them play a major role in the plot.  Most movies with lots of computer help just have the special effects in the movie, but they are unnecessary.  This film needs all the effects it has to make the story believeable.<br />The movie tells us of a man named Neo(Keanu Reeves) who works at a software company (when he gets up on time), and does lots of illicit computer hacking work off the clock.  He has been searching for a seemingly mythical figure named Morpheus.  Through a series of strange events, Morpheus(Lawrence Fishburne) contacts Neo and brings him to a meeting with the help of the leather clad Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss).  At this meeting, Morpheus drops a complete bomb on Neo- that his life as he has known it means nothing.<br />The world is actually controlled by machines who use human infants like batteries, absorbing the body heat for power.  The computers invented an imaginary &quot;Matrix&quot; for the humans to live in, which is the world we now inhabit.  Because we are so comfortable here, we don't try to break out and get away from the control of these machines.  Morpheus and his select crew of assistants on his ship are fighting against the machines in the real world, which has no sunlight and has suffered mass destruction from the numerous battles over the years.  Neo has to make a decision whether to join the battle or to go back to the blissful ignorance of the Matrix.<br />The special effects in the movie are great and are well used.  The fighting sequences and the jump sequences when the camera spins 360 degrees around the person are really cool.  There is a scene where someone in the group has to be rescued from the Agents(machines in human form in the Matrix) and the effects of the gunfire and destruction are some of the best you will see.  The film would suffer without the fantasticcomputer visual effects it has.<br />Interesting, how much this movie references Christianity and the Bible.  The last human city is called Zion, the character Trinity is a reference to the holy trinity, the character Neo is obviously patterned after Jesus Christ, as the one saviour of the world.  How about Morpheus's ship being called the Nebukadnezzar, after the king in the bible?  There is even a Judas type figure who betrays the whole group.<br />In general, the Matrix is a very slick sci-fi thriller with lots of action, a cool storyline, and lots of effects which are real fun.  The sequels (one of which I have seen and one I have not) simply can't match up to this.  I recommend this film for any action fan's shelf.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania ROCKS witht the best of them on her new DVD UP!!! A must for the Shania fan on your XMAS list.
B00005JM02|4.0|This is a charming story about a son fish who gets kidnapped by some scuba divers right in front of his father. His fathers quest while he stops at nothing including fish, and being out of the water, to find his son Nemo. Will he make it on time to save is son from being a birthday presant? Watch to find out.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain's star still shines bright with her new DVD released last month. The concert is basically the one shown on NBC but with a few extras. I enjoyed it and continue to.
B000002IJA|2.0|This album is supposed to be a soundtrack/greatest hits. But, look at it this way. If it was a greatest hits, it should have Back in Black, Shoot to Thrill, and many other very obvious ones. If it is supposed to be best of,I mean comon. It may have been just a compilation of Brian Johnson, so why is Ride on on here. Take my advise, this is a waste of time.
B00005JL78|4.0|Dude this is the coolest movie ever Tom Cruse is great in it and dude this is one dark ass film I mean it doesnt really even have a happy ending but the action and plot is good. So Rent it see if it's good for the kids my opinion is 14 or 15 and up condiderng it has a grousome for a PG13 eye removal and more violent than much and a theem of Rape of a small child
B000002J1U|5.0|Lets face it. If you've heard zeppelin before than you probably have listened to them so many times that you'd rather die than ever hear stairway again (like me) or at least your in the process of this.For me though this album is still listenable. it keeps the suedo blues showboating to a minimum and instead displays pages keen folk sensibilities. Just listen to the song friends in your car on a snowy night, its one of the most haunting songs i've ever heard. Contrasting this is thats the way which is stunningly beautiful with its acoustic folk strumming using an open tuning (c i think). there are still rockers to like immigrant song. Only zeppelin can make a hard rock anthem about vikings that isnt cheesy at all. Basically the point I failed to make at the start of the review is that if your new to zeppellin pick this up first because it will stay with you the longest. Pick up their first 2 later because although they are beyond amazing youll grow tired of them faster. P.S. I am not putting down zep in any way.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania sings all her hits in this explosive dvd that would be a great gift for the holidays. she is a very interactive performer, and you feel like you are performing with her she is so crowd oriented.  only 3 songs from her woman in me album though, but come on over and up she sings most all of the singles and more.
B00009RDG9|4.0|I only take a star away from this movie because the end of it is foreseeable very early.  The rest is perfect.  The acting is incredible, the plot is quite layered, and the fight scenes are in a league by themselves in terms of movie fights.  Most fights in movies are standard standing-waiting-to-be-hit affairs, where the characters show no pain after taking blows that, in the real world, would have sent them crumbling to the ground.  Granted, after taking a stake through the thigh Tommy Lee Jones' character would never have been able to stand and fight on it, but the scenes are impeccably choreographed and very real, with the martial arts angle adding further realism.  It was an especially nice touch that Jones didn't hook up with the FBI agent at all during the movie; it was all about him and Del Toro, and their story together, which made it all the more realistic.  At the end he goes back to being a lone wolf, and is perfectly satisfied, as is the audience.  This film is definitely worth seeing, and if you like this kind of film worth buying.  Be warned, though, the violence (especially the opening scene) is excessively graphic and bloody; in other words, real.
0553296981|5.0|The book Anne Frank, \\" The Diary of a young Girl\\" to me was very outstanding! It had interested me a lot. I couldn't even imagine having to go through such a harsh life as Anne Frank. At such a young age, Anne had experienced being in a concentration camp where she was then treated very badly and kept hidden. She began writing in her diary about everything that happened to her and many other people. It was such a terrible life that it was like a real-live nightmare. Thousands had died through this cruel and ruthless treatment, just for being a Jew.  Just to think that all this time Hitler had been behind all of this and nobody said anything, it's hard to believe that people where actually behind him with his decision. He was a very selfish person and he didn't care about anything but him self. Author B.M. Mooyaart; gave so much information about Anne's experiences. I have never read an Anne Frank book before, and as a first time reader I felt like I've known about an Anne Frank forever. I hope all will enjoy this version, just like I did. Everyone needs to learn there history, Jewish or not. The whole thing about the Nazi's and the Holocaust was an epidemic of hatred. Just by reading all of this made me fill up in tears. Anne Frank gave us all a message saying, livelong, if not in age but in people's heart. and she'll stay in mine.
B0000VCZK2|2.0|A DTS track on Aliens and Alien 3 for starters.  The DTS tracks were one of the most important things I was hoping enjoy with this set.  Without them is a major disappointment and knocks this title off my reference list.
0385504209|2.0|From what I surmise, Dan Brown has an intense interest in the early roots of Christianity.  I guess that he had a number of interesting theories supported by specious but tantalizing evidence that couldn't stand up to the scrutiny of non-fiction writing.  Instead, he turns his theories into the background for a rather pedestrian murder mystery that Agatha Christie could have churned out between lunch and tea.<br />The plot twists are outrageous, the settings are your typical tourist site backdrops, with standard conspiracy theory thrown in for flavoring.  The puzzles for which the book has become famous are far too easy.  On the one hand, the two-dimensional characters are incredibly knowledgeable, but on the other it takes them forever to solve puzzles that any one who paid attention in high school world history could solve.  The popularity of this novel will inevitably lead to a screenplay, which is well suited for canned Hollywood blockbusters.<br />I gave this book two stars because it is a fairly pleasant read, despite the poor plot and character development.  The historical theorizing are also interesting.  If Dan Brown had been able to write an entire book just on the anti-feminism of the early church, he would have had a great work. However, it seems that he recognized his scholarship was too shallow for academic scrutiny, so he tried to convey his ideas through rather trite pulp fiction.<br />I sugggest he take all the money he's made from this book and devote his career to plumbing the depths of his theories.  He may have something to write about some day.
6304712936|5.0|i've always been intrested in classical music. this movie has always been one of my favorites. it is wonderful.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have never been a Britney fan but after giving this cd a chance, WOW!!  Has she ever matured!!<br />Some of you complain that she can't sing, you know what, half the artists out there can't sing either but at least she admits it.  She is not just a singer, she is a performer!!<br />If you don't like it, change the freakin' channel!!
B000021YQV|2.0|With the exception of Chop Suey and Forest, this album is nothing but screaming over intense power chords....and to me that is not music. How can everyone say that this is such a masterpiece? You want a masterpiece that rocks? Check out Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; or &quot;Black Album&quot; or Cigar's &quot;Speed is Relative&quot; or any of the earlier stuff by Led Zeppelin. This album has a few nice moments, but those moments are more than offset by moments of crap. Yes, sometimes Serj Tankian hits a pretty note or sometimes they play a cool guitar riff or drum fill, but there is too much incoherent screaming and angry, cliched death metal nonsense. Too many bands think that in order to rock they have to scream and play their guitars as loudly as possible. Jimmy Page didnt play super loud and intense power chords, and he was one of the best guitarists of all time! You dont have to be loud simply for the sake of being loud to rock, and these guys do not rock.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I've read with a bit of puzzlement many of these reviews which have criticized Sarah for the &quot;trite&quot; lyrics contained on Afterglow. It seems to me that many Sarah fans have expected her to write ad infinitum about the same types of emotions and sentimients on each of her albums. Complexity, burning and suffering are all good and well, as they are what drew me to Sarah (in the form of Solace and FTE) in the first place as an angst-ridden youth who had no desire to listen to the grungy creations that were Nirvana. <br />Both of those albums, however, were written at least a decade ago. How many of you would write the same songs today that you were writing ten years ago? If the lyrics to &quot;Push&quot; seem especially banal and unremarkable to those of you who compare it to &quot;Possession,&quot; or &quot;Ice&quot; or &quot;Elsewhere&quot; or &quot;Fear&quot; or whatever song off of Fumbling it is that speaks to you, then you are forgetting the context in which the newer songs were written. Sarah is a wife and mother now, two things which can tend to bring out one's simpler side, and lead one to contemplate *gasp* pure, uncomplicated love.  <br />The bottom line is that, yes...the lyrics to this album do not have the same intensity and punch that her previous efforts have. But I expected that. But her voice and musicality is just as flawless as ever. And at least for me, the biggest attraction to Sarah has always been her consistent ability to disregard whatever &quot;hip&quot; rap/bubble-gum/hip-hop forms are dominating at the moment, and stick to her true form. Afterglow may not be as edgy and mind-blowing as her earlier work, true. But it is still Sarah...and well worth a listen.
1570429596|5.0|Most of the other books out there spew out the same information, have a lot of writing and still say absolutely nothing. Rich Dad Poor Dad is different and does offer a fresh approach and one that actually works.<br />Another thing I like is the multiple learning systems available via audio or book or both. I enjoyed the book and the audio program as well. <br />Good stuff. Highly recommended. On the other hand, you can always buy one of those other books and go nowhere.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This was Jethro Tull's response to everybody who thought Aqualung was a concept album. Yes, Aqualung has songs that run on similiar themes but that's as far as it went. Here, Ian and co. decided to give everyone a concept that pushed the envelope of rock. The story is on the front cover about a fictional elementary schoolboy named Gerald Bostock who writes a poem that causes great controversy and is disqualified because of threats from the public. Thick As A Brick is the first rock album to have one song taking up the whole album. The lyrics are full of wit and commentary on society which goes with the articles on the cover. The music is complex and certain musical themes are reprised throughout. This is Monty Python put to music! There's never a dull moment on this album. Get this album!
B0000B1OE7|5.0|Everything about this movie is excellent. From, the story, characters and the animation. Jam packed with action. In my opinion this has the best anime style. Those who rated it poorly are idiots, i agree. The back of the dvd says its for a mature audience and says what kinda material is in it. This isnt no Pokemon or yugio. This movie has some sex and of course violence, and the leading female doesnt get raped every 20 minutes. Whoever said that is prolly some fat ugly lady jealous of a female Anime character. Of course there is gonna be violence its called Ninja Scroll, about a Ninja with a sword and of course he's gonna use that sword in the movie,Duh! <BR>Expect slicing of limbs and other parts. A good review should be based on the genre of the movie.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Elegant, intricate, soaring, magical, and sometimes heavy.  The Christmas spirit dances in this amazing work.<br />It comes at a much needed time, as all brilliant albums seem to do.  Personally, I haven't been in tune with Tull since the Heavy Horses days - but ahhhhh, what times those were!  <br />This recording is the culmination of everything great about Jethro Tull.  Ian Anderson sounds 30 years younger.  It's truly amazing.  The production is mind-blowing, and the re-recordings of some of the old stuff (ie. Weathercock, Soltice Bells) sparkle with new energy and crispness.<br />I can't begin to explain the incredible musical experiences this album has invoked in me.  And that Christmas feeling!  This is dripping with the sounds and images of classic yuletide.  Though I'm a lover of Tull (and currently rediscovering this incredible band) I think this album trancends being a &quot;fan&quot; and reaches to a magical place that's in us all... A place of castles, wonder, enchantment, and bells...  Lot's of beautiful bells.<br />If you haven't seen the album cover yet, it ranks up there as one of the best.  It so wonderfully represents the texture and feel of the music.  And by the way, there's a great little read inside the enclosed book by Ian. <br />Do yourself a favor - pick this album up today.<br />Merry Christmas!
B0000B1OE7|5.0|Excellent Movie,Characters, Art.  The Anniversary Edition has an actual interview with the director and an interview with the English voice cast of two of the main characters. Really cool. Full and Widescreen, Wow. The full screen is the Original movie. Its a lil different from the regular Ninja Scroll DVD. The only difference i noticed was around the beginning when it shows the title of Ninja Scroll. It Shows it in Japanese writing. There may be other differences, i dunno. Another difference from the dvds is that this one's got More dubbed languages, Spanish and French. Its kinda cool listening to it in other languages. The some sound effects are different and a bit of the music is different in the Spanish version. What the Anniversary Edition doesnt have that the regular dvd has is the Story synopsis and original theatrical trail. I was a lil shocked but its ok, i got both. If u got the original and ur a big fan, get this. The casing is cool and u get a lil two sided poster. Oh yeah in the interview I found out that there's a Ninja Scroll 2 coming out schedualed for 2005!! This Movies for mature people, u can be young and mature. Some of these critics down here don't know what they are talkin about. I dont got no pixelation problems on my disc, the widescreen is fine, and yes there is sex and violence (hello its an anime movie) be a lil more mature, and this movie has an excellent plot.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam has been one of my favourites and by far one of the best bands ever.  With a lineup of members that have talent beyond description, lyrical ability to make you think, feel, love, hate, etc and music to fit your any mood, Pearl Jam definitely deserves all the stars in the world.<BR>LOST DOGS, a collection of rarities and bsides from their expanding career is one of the best collection I've seen in years.  The vocals surpass (by a longshot) what we've been hearing on the radio stations and music channels recently, the music is complete and bold and every song has it's own style and feel.<BR>Here's a review of all the songs:<br />1. All Night - a great song to open the brilliant cd with, a great music song 4/5<BR>2. Sad - one of the best on the CDs, lyrically intelligent and vocally beautiful - 5/5<BR>3. Down - the lyrics are fun, 5/5<BR>4. Hitchhiker - one of my personal favs, it's such a great song especially with the brilliant opening line 'YOU FOOL' - 5/5<BR>5. Don't Gimme No Lip - one of the songs that Ed doesn't sing, I'm not a fan of the songs without the master of vocals, but this one is OK - 3/5<BR>6. Alone - I've known this song for a long time now, it's a little different than the version I'm used to but I think that's a good thing since it's more focused on the vocals - 4.5/5<BR>7. In the Moonlight - an all around good song - 4/5<BR>8. Education - a song that WILL get stuck in your head, great lyrics and music - 5/5<BR>9. Black, Red, Yellow - again, a song I've known, brilliant - 5/5<BR>10. U - as Ed says, it is a simple song - 4/5<BR>11. Leavin' Here - a cover song, I really like it though - 5/5<BR>12. Gremmie Out of Control - feels like a surfing song, always fun to listen to - 4.5/5<BR>13. Whale Song - I'm not a fan of this one (maybe because Ed doesn't sing it?) the vocals are OK and the music is drained - 3/5<BR>14. Undone - one of the best songs, again.  Beautifully written - 5/5<BR>15. Hold On - another outrageous track, one of the best - 5/5<BR>16. Yellow Ledbetter - they saved the best 3 tracks for last I guess...everyone knows this one.  The live version is better but this one still has it - 5/5<BR>***<BR>1. Fatal - my favourite song, brilliant, amazing, beatiful - 5/5<BR>2. Other Side - another one of my favs!  The music is different, I love it - 5/5<BR>3. Hard to Imagine - A nice song to listen to - 5/5<BR>4. Footsteps - 'I've got scratches all over my arms, one for each day since I fell apart' that says it all - 5/5<BR>5. Wash - Odd lyrics, mellow music - 4/5<BR>6. Dead Man - Beauty at its best - 5/5<BR>7. Strangest Tribe - If you need another reason to buy the album, this song is it - 5/5<BR>8. Drifting - A nice song, seems short - 4/5<BR>9. Let Me Sleep - Beautiful lyrics and a nice message - 5/5<BR>10. Last Kiss - At first I didn't see the fascination about this song but I know it know - it's pure brilliant - 5/5<BR>11. Sweet Lew - First vocals we've heard from Jeff, he should stick to playing bass - 3/5<BR>12. Dirty Frank - not my favourite song but funny - 3.5/5<BR>13. Brother - no vocals here, a great guitar song but it probably would have been better if Ed had some vocals - 4/5<BR>14. Bee Girl - Has a folk feel to it, a calming song - 4/5<BR>15. 4/20/02 - to Layne Staley, a nice song from Ed - 4/5<br />In all, BUY THIS ALBUM, you will not regret it!
0385504209|4.0|This book is perfect for anyone that wants to get into reading.  It is a sure page-turner that grabs you from the start.  No patience is needed for reading it.  There is constantly something exciting going on, which Brown accomplishes with his short chapters that end right after a small \\"bomb\\" is dropped on the reader.<br />Most people will be pleased reading this book.  There are many fascinating things and lessons to be learned from The Da Vinci Code.  One is that there are many sides to a single story, and to never take history's word for what has really happened.<br />I felt a bit of emptiness as I began to finish this book, I think mainly because I didn't know what to take as fact or fiction from what I had just read.  However, there are many, many positives to this book, and if you can weed out everything else, you will walk away a happy, enlightened customer.
B00005NKW3|5.0|I have owned and watched MIRACLE ON 34th STREET every Christmas for as long as I can remember.  It is so much more than a story about &quot;a guy who thinks he's Santa Claus&quot;; it is a fable about the power of kindness and of faith in a materialistic world.  The screenplay, based on the novel by Valentine Davies, is extraordinarily clever and subtle in its use of these themes; the entire cast, from Maureen O'Hara as &quot;self-made woman&quot; Doris Walker, to little Natalie Wood as her precocious young daughter, Susan, to Porter Hall as a loathsome &quot;department store psychiatrist,&quot; to Edmund Gwenn (with his English accent and grandfatherly appearance) as Kris Kringle himself.   For me the holiday season would be incomplete without MIRACLE.
0676973779|5.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; is by far the most beautifully written book of the year. You can't help but get emotionnally involved and putting it down is simply not an option. The fact that it is a true story makes the whole book even more mesmorizing. Martel has done a wonderful job of turning Pi Patel's story of heartache,courage and pure will to survive into an emotionnal rollercoster that will take you from overwhelming joy to furious anger only to leave you with tears in your eyes and an undiscribable feeling in your heart. It is the kind of book that keeps you thinking long after you have finished reading it. I suggest this book to anyone who is sick of reading &quot;average jo&quot; books that leave you empty and board. You will not regret it. Enjoy!
0671027344|5.0|This book, has so many lessons about life, throughout its' pages.  There is no one who can say they don't relate to Charlie, and the things he does.  His thoughts make you question many things in your own life, and you find yourself comparing your life to his.  The story is very well written, and is probably one of the best books you will ever read.  You will never forget the lessons you learned from this book.  AFter reading this book, I felt as if Charlie was my closest friend.  I found myself wanting to read more about his life, and his thoughts. You are doing yourself a HUGE favor, by buying this book! It's amazing, how from just one book, you can carry away so much.
0689835604|3.0|I purchased this book online due to the excellent reviews it received, but when I got it in the mail I was disappointed by its simplicity.  My 20 month old son has been \\"reading\\" since he was 4 months old and I thought this book would be fun for him as he learned more body parts such as his, elbows, chin, knees, etc., but it is very basic.  It teaches hands, eyes, belly button, mouth, and feet.  One positive feautre of this book that I did not expect to find was the ethnic diversity of the children illustrated in the book.  Overall, this book may be best suited for 18 months and younger although if my son read it when he was younger he may still enjoy it at 20 months.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This is the first time i ever felt moved enough to write a review. George's music is timeless. Even Frank Sinatra called Something the most beautiful love song ever written. That said, seeing the respectful gathering to honor George is something truly moving. The music is wonderful, the performances are stellar...Eric Clapton did a wonderful job planning, producing and performing. Buy it, watch the DVD, enjoy it, love it. I still can't help but be moved to tears when i watch it. We will always love and apprecitae how George touched all our lives. Not as a star, or a celebrity, but with his soul and his music. God bless!

B0000C8AUO|5.0|I have been a Bowie fan since the early 70's. I have to say this is to date his best. The sound is tight and stripped down. The songs are beautiful. He has reached back to pull echos of his past work, yet it is so reflective of his maturity and skill as an artist.  I love this album.  I HIGHLY recommend it
B000001Y2U|5.0|I have a turmoil inside me. I'm trying to decide which album I like more, this or Golden Age of Grotesque (don't know why everyone hates that one). Compared to their later releases, this one sounds very raw and gothic, and the lyrics contain a lot more screaming a hissing than before, and the subject matter for the songs is far darker than anything to come before or after (even Holy Wood, which I see more as a polished clone of Antichrist Superstar, wasn't THIS dark).<br />1. Irresponsible Hate Anthem: This song dosen't do that much for me, I don't know why. Great, heavy start to the album though. 4/5<br />2. The Beautiful People: Brilliant. Heavy and well thought out. Has one of the best introductions in history! 5/5<br />3. Dried Up, Tied And Dead to the World: A little downbeat compared to the previous two, and a great song as a result! 4/5<br />4. Another one I don't really like that much. The singing gets on my nerves a little. 3/5<br />5. Little Horn: Why does everyone hate this? IT'S F**KING BRILLIANT! 5/5<br />6. Cryptorchild: Weird. 3/5<br />7. Deformography: Less weird, better for it. 4/5<br />8. Wormboy: Weird, not fantastic, but I like it. 4/5<br />9. Mister Superstar: Ths song is perverted. Like the instruments, the lyrics are really disturbing. 4/5<br />10. Angel With Scabbed Wings: Great rock anthem. One of my faves. 5/5<br />11. Kinderfield: A bit of a turnaround. Very, very spooky! 3/5<br />12. Antichrist Superstar: Another weird one, but catchy chorus. 4/5<br />13. 1996: This song rocks my world. Fast, catchy and the best song on the album. Curiously, it's the only song where he so much as mentions \\"Antichrist Superstar\\". Maybe Marilyn got the titles the wrong way round. 6/5<br />14. Minute of Decay: Another spooky one, but better than Kinderfield. 4/5<br />15. The Reflecting God: another superb song, my second favourite. 5/5<br />16. Man That You Fear: Brillant. A fantastic, gothic way to end the album that really moves you the first few times youhear it. 5/5
B000069HK2|4.0|These guys will knock your socks off from the first note of &quot;Maybe Memories&quot;. They have a way with their music that makes it incredibly unique, while not really doing anything new. All i can say is that youy'd better pick it up if you're into emo-core.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|<BR>I can't believe Fox have cancelled this series, we all sci-fi fans thought that Star Trek was underrated but it survived more seasons than Firefly. This a new and fresh approach to the genre, isn't for brainy hard-core sci-fi followers, just light and simple piece of entertainment.<br />The conception of other worlds portayed as an old-western may not be new and had nothing spectacular about it, but the writers and creator did a fine job changing some concepts in it, such as prostitution seen as some well-respected social status that hardly few people dare to touch even in a movie (BTW, Morena Baccarin was so gorgeous).<br />Emmy awarded visual FX are out of discussion and the cast, if not so well known, were pretty convincing at their roles (well, maybe Nathan Fillion seemed a little too good person for an outlaw and smuggler).<br />All in all the characters were well defined and the nice side stories and main plot could have had a good chance to evolve into an epic classic (just look at Whedon's Buffy).<BR>Can't wait to buy this DVD. Sry for my english.
B000099T2L|5.0|This was a really good CD.  Beyonce should really consider continuing on with her solo career!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Neo is as stiff as cardboard, some of the other characters were ---- ridiculously cast as people from the future.  Too much pointless babble, French guy and the Twins were great, but the other characters were exceptionall weak.  Don't even get me started on Zion.....what a joke.
B0000TB03W|5.0|You either love Shania or are completely apathetic. No? Of course this is not high art but it is populist entertainment of the highest calibre. The reason this will sell so well is that her fans obviously connect with her songs, the crack band seemingly enjoys playing them and Shania is both lovely and personable. For example, Shania allows a guy to propose to his girl on stage (she accepts!) as well as going out into the crowd (at one point allowing a young lady to sing the next line, which she nails on key, no less!) Not many artists work as hard to break down the barrier that usually exists between fan and artist. The setlist is exactly what you would expect of a two hour show drawn from a catalogue of four albums. All the hits, in other words, and a few choice album cuts. <BR>Production wise, not many artists have a show filmed for a national network with all the expertise that goes with that. All of the NBC special is here plus more of what wasn't aired. The camera work and editing is as good as I have seen in the DVD format. I'm somewhat surprised that this wasn't mixed down to DTS 5.1 but the Dolby 5.1 is fine and clear. All in all, a great package for the Shania lover in your life at a fair price. Enjoy !
B000002GA8|5.0|This Master Piece is incredible and I extremely recomend to buy Journey To The Centre Of The Earth(live)by Rick Wakeman, because is music and music in simply words is magnific.
B00008H2LB|5.0|No, I'm not labeling this as bubblegum pop-this album is far from it!!  I just recently got into Meteora as a result of liking Linkin Park's current singles.  I love how LP fuses mellow rap with hard rock!  Finally, something original in new music!!  I hate most rap, but with Linkin Park, you can actually understand what they're saying.  They also rap and sing about  problems that the average person can relate to-just listen to \\"Numb\\" and \\"Hit The Foor\\"!  It's more than just hoes, bling-bling, drugs, and 24-inch rims!  But at the same time the hard rock part isn't about blood, guts, and suicide either.  Unintelligible scream fests are also kept to a minimum here as well.  Plus, unlike other major hard rock acts, Linkin Park doesn't need to say F*** 30 times per song to get their point across!  All in all, an excellent alternative rock album with VARIETY-which is something I don't find too often with new albums!  I don't even need to skip over tracks!  Give it a try!  I'm a major Britney and 'N Sync fan, and this album even made ME take a second glance!  No, I'm not some teenybopper trying to fit in with the cool crowd at the local Hot Topic store.  I couldn't care less what the latest \\"goth\\" fashion is.  I'm a twenty-year old college student with no one that I care to impress!  I also don't feel the need to attach a music genre label to myself, such as the term \\"punk\\".  Sorry for dragging on like this, but I am so sick and tired of close minded people! By that, I mean people who think I am only entitled to listen to pop music just because I have the Backstreet Boys in my CD collection!  I figure no one is in the same mood all the time, so why listen to only one type of music?
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The listener must understand the subtext of the songs in order to appreciate the album. The breakup of the band is clearly and sadly documented in songs such as Two of Us, Let It Be, the Long and Winding Road, I Me Mine, etc. The album now holds together, as it was intended to. This is the first time I can say a remix brought an album up from 2 stars to 4 stars, out of 5, or 3-1/2 out of 4. As Paul said about complaits that the Beatles double album had some bad cuts, \\"Sod it, it's the Beatles!\\" Enjoy!
055350259X|5.0|I love to hear Bill Bryson read his books aloud.  His 10 disc monologue on Australia was, by turns, fascinating, LOL amusing, astonishing, informative, good natured and good company.  I won't describe the book's content here - others have done a fine job in their reviews.  My focus is, instead, on the experience of LISTENING to Bill Bryson.  I regularly listen to books on CD as I drive around Upstate New York for work. After spending many hundreds of hours hearing recordings of books, I fancy myself an experienced and discriminating listener.  IMHO, Bryson is an engaging and sociable reader as well as a superb (virtual) travelling companion.  I believe he genuinely enjoys the act of reading aloud for others.  After hearing this generous yet informal treatment, I am reluctant to read the print verion.  I fear that the inevitable change in my experience of Bryson's Voice, caused by experiencing him visually instead of with my ears, would strike me as a loss.  Listening to the CD version of In a Sunburned Country, it was my happy experience to feel that Bryson was sharing his stories of Australia directly with me.
0395177111|5.0|First let me say that I have read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; six times, the first time being thirty six years ago when I was twenty-one.  Each time I have read it I haven't tired of Tolkein's marvelous storytelling abilities and the depth and staying power that this tale has.<br />Called &quot;The Enchanting Prelude to the Lord of the Rings,&quot; one might come away with the erroneous perception that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a preface of sorts that can be easily skipped.  Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.<br />&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo.  The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli.  In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.<br />This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.<br />If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late.  &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.<br />Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.<br />Douglas McAllister
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I want to say that we all know Britneys voice is not supreme or anything but she does have some talent and DONT hate just because your not her. She can be a great performer also, although frankly I am getting extremely tired of seeing her LIPSYNC her way through 99% of her performances. She was at the KISSFM Jingle ball and she was the only one who lipsynched practically her whole act. WHY DO YOU DO THIS BRITNEY? I have seen you sing before and you can do it, so why dont you? If you have to tone down the dancing, than do it. All in all, this album is very good with the exception of a few bad hip hop songs. It is also very sexual which I think is good, some may disagree. Personally I like Me against the music, Shadow, Everytime, Brave new Girl, Breathe, and Touch of my hand. This is definitely a different sound for her which is fine but from what I hear most people prefer the Baby one more time Britney over the Boom Boom Britney.
B00006GFAB|4.0|Ok, I agree - there have been loads of KISS compilation albums.  But what makes this one special is that it includes the original recordings that most prefer.  While the track &quot;Rock and Roll All Night&quot; may be the live version here, it's important to remember that this version was the hit, not the studio version.  Therefore its inclusion on this album is appropriate. <br />KISS first compilation was &quot;Double Plantinum&quot; in 1978.  The problem with it was that it contained remixes.  I am not a fan of remixes!<br />What I particularly like about this compilation is that it includes lots of early tracks like &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; and &quot;Strutter&quot;.  Naturally there are some missing later hits such as &quot;Sure Know Something&quot; and &quot;Shandi&quot;, but this is understandable particularly the latter which comes from their dismal album &quot;Uncovered&quot;.  I don't think any KISS compilations include tracks from &quot;Uncovered&quot; because it was their most disappointing period - a time when the KISS sound became too commercial and most international countries dismissed them.  Except for Australia where KISS became such a phenomenon in 1980 that it was scary.  It was more the paraphernalia that people wanted, the t-shirts, the posters (the music was second).<br />This compilation is PERFECT for people who do not own any KISS albums, but want to own at least one.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Great cover too!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|It's been 5 whole years since her last album and I couldn't wait for her new album.  Now that I've heard it (over and over again) I can say that I like it but not as much as Fumbling Towards Ecstacy.  There are only 9 songs on the album which is a little dissapointing, but I like five of 'em...Fallen, Stupid, World on Fire, Train Wreck (kinda reminds me of a Seal song), and Push.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I thought the The Fellowship was a better movie overall, but even so, I can't help but watch this Two Towers repeatedly just because it's so well done.
B00008RH3L|5.0|It is hard to find DVDs treated with such reverence by their makers.<br />The quality of the transfer, color saturation, and the extras are all some of the best seen in release.<br />Add to that, one of the better bits of story-telling in many years.<br />Hard to believe this was only the Coen Brother's second outing in film, just after the auspicious debut, \\"Blood Simple\\".<br />For those who didn't pick up on their work until the success of \\"Raising Arizona\\", it is very much worth going back & picking up this DVD. It's recreation of the 1920s, and the dissection of gangland rivalries, is exceptional.<br />Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Tuturro, Marcia Gay Harden are all exceptional. But there are many more actors in smaller but pivital rolls who will also catch your eye.<br />And in the annals of cinema, the sequence where Albert Finney's character has a shoot-out with opposing gang hit-men, will be studied for years. Terrific storytelling, with nary a word spoken. It ranks up there with the opening scene of \\"Touch of Evil\\".<br />For those of you who love great moviemaking, this is for you.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|Alicia Keys is an amazing talent. No doubts there. <br />However, I feel that neither of her albums have yet to fully grasp all of her potential. On this latest work as well as the last, the entire album's supported on two to three solid tracks. The rest still seems to be filler, a la flavor of the month pop. Alicia Keys is more than this and that is why I only give her latest three stars.<br />Until Keys develops an entire album that is dymanic and exciting from start to finish, she's yet to show her stuff. See Outkast, for example. That's potential that's tapped.<br />I would also like to see more piano infusion. She prides herself as a piano prodigy, but many of the tracks are void of or lacking enough of the instrument.
B00005JL78|1.0|one of the most stupid movies i have ever seen and i used to work for blockbuster INC.....
078681859X|5.0|Parents should know that the book contains quite a bit of violence: murders of characters occur throughout the book, children possibly commit violent crimes, and brutalities against people and magical beings are detailed.<br />I'm not complaining! The darker passages are not gratuitous but contribute to the story's progress and fill out a captivating, believable world. If I were 12, I'd be grateful for someone not sugar-coating a good story.<br />\\"The Amulet\\" is more tautly woven than the Harry Potter stories, and Stroud's writing is better and more disciplined than J. K. Rowling's. Then again, Rowling's characters are more vivid, and she creates more Atmosphere around them.<br />I think bright young readers will appreciate the publisher's decision to leave in the British jargon for U.S. sales and not (as with the Harry Potter books) make an Americanized version. A boy wears trainers (not sneakers), a car has a bonnet (not a hood), a teen has spots (not pimples), etc.
0385504209|5.0|This was a page turner, a murder mystery with an historic plot that will keep your attention throughout. The only fault was the end seemed a little hastily written, like the author ran out of time and had to feed you a condensed version to get it to his publisher on time! I still give it 5 stars!
B00005RRG9|5.0|This movie is so endearing when you first watch it.  I was in my pre-teens when I first watched The Parent Trap and for awhile I couldn't get enough of it.  Finally, when I turned 19, my parents bought it on DVD for me as a birthday present.  I do not get to watch my movies much, but I love this one.  It is one I never did grow out of yet and I don't think I ever will.  It is the story about two twin daughters, Susan and Sharon, who meet at a summer camp and find out that they are twins.  They then come up with a plan to switch places to bring their separated parents, Mitch and Maggie, back together.  Susan goes to Boston and tries act like a refined young lady while Sharon goes out west to be a tom-boy girl.  They run into some problems, but they are able to bring their parents back together in the end.  This is a funny, loving, and a wonderful movie to watch, especially for young teenage girls.  It may be some-what out-dated, but it is still a great and touching movie.  Please, parents, if you are shopping for your young girl, buy this movie for them.  I enjoyed it.
B00008EY9G|4.0|I did not expect the twist in the middle. (Of course, I knew nothing about the movie going into it.)<br />The twist in the middle threw me, I felt a bit put out by it. I never got completely back into the movie, but by the end I was mostly back in, and liked it well enough.<br />John Cussack is perfect; and a couple of the most violent bits become situationally expremely funny. The rest of the cast are also fairly perfect, but I am a Cussack fan at heart, and I liked his performance.<br />So... all in all? It was ok. I like it.
0061020710|4.0|In general Terry Pratchett's Discworld is the lastest series I have found that is one of my favorite series. This is the first Discworld book but is not the best. (Personally, just so you know I think the best ones take place in Anhk-Morpok). It is good for understanding Discworld. If you don't like this one, give Discworld a second chance.<br />I seem to be saying what is bad about it but I still think it is great.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As a devout freak fan of the book, movie, and score, I felt that although Annie Lennox' &quot;Into the West&quot; was a respectable song sung with a beautiful voice, it just doesn't fit in with the rest of this score.  If anyone has seen the cartoon version of The Lord of the Rings, I believe that it would have fit well at the end of that movie, because the style would have been more appropriate.  That being said, I still give the CD 5 stars because the rest of the work is just brilliant and I love Billy Boyd's singing.
0385504209|4.0|This is definitely one of the greatest books I've ever read. It was so hard to put it down after starting it. But when I got about half-way thru it, I decided it was time for me to stop. Dan Brown is a brilliant man, but he needs to check his sources if he wants to slag the Catholic church like that. I've been a Caholic since I was a week old and it's a huge part of who I am. Most of the historical information presented in the book is false, but he seems to clearly state otherwise in the introduction. Opus Dei is real, but nothing like what happened in the book would ever happen in real life. I just find it deeply offensive that Dan Brown writes about another instance where the Catholic church is being humiliated, even though it is ficticious, in the midst of the sex-abuse scandal wew are facing right now. So overall, enjoy the story, but ignore the historical info.
B00000J6AG|1.0|Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold, synthetic, superficial beats, create an unsettling tension that sounds unintended. He should be made to leave his room and go out and get some exercise.
0743216458|5.0|Being a Baby Boomer this book help me to understand the people that have helped shape my world view.

0441003257|5.0|People who like the Hitchhiker's trilogy will enjoy this. That doesn't mean all people who like one must like the other, but both are very funny. <br />As you probably already know, this is a story of the apocholapse (spelling?) but with charactors such as the angel who not so much feel as sauntered vaguely downward. <br />This is a funny story that diserves to be reread multiple times. At least for those who read books multiple times. I am surprised I hadn't read it before I did and wish I was told how good it was.<br />Just so you know, &quot;The trouble with trying to find a brown-covered book among brown leaves and brown water at the bottom of a ditch of brown earth in the brown, well grayish, light of dawn, was that you couldn't&quot;
0440229081|4.0|Skellig is about a boy, his family and the people who help him grow.  Michael, an athletic boy (especially in football, or soccer in the U.S.), moves to a new house with his parents.  Soon after the move his mother gives birth to a premature baby who has many problems.  While cleaning the house and property, preparing for the baby's home coming, Michael stumbles upon something in the garage.  He finds Skellig, a man who has been staying in there since before the previous owner of the house died.  Michael starts bringing him things like Chinese food and aspirin, and chats with him.  Michael soon meets Mina, a very clever girl, and takes her to see Skellig.  They take Skellig to an abandoned house where he gains strength and shows them that he has wings.  They join hands in a circle and float around the room and transparent wings form on their backs.  While the adventure with Skellig is going on, Michaels gets worse.  The doctors want to operate on her and the night before surgery, Skellig goes to her and somehow gives her the strength to make it through.  Later, Skellig says good-bye to Michael and Mina and heads out to find others in need of an angel.<BR> I very much enjoyed reading this book.  Usually when I read a book, I pick a stopping point but the only good point for this book was the end.  I could tell that the story takes place somewhere in Europe, primarily Great Britain or England, because of the dialogue Almond uses.  It is set sometime in the present or near past because the technology is about the same because they do heart surgery on an infant and they order Chinese food in Europe.  The characters seem real but only Skellig's personality, intellect, and weakness seems real.  The fact that he has wing is entertaining but it just isn't realistic.  His bitterness toward everything is evidence of his pain and because he has wings, he doesn't want to be seen by anyone for fear of being discovered.  Mina is a kind-hearted person who, probably because of being home schooled, is very intelligent.  She knows every thing about birds and the fact that Skellig has wings is no coincidence made by Almond.  Michael's parents seem to pour all their love and attention into the sick baby but also find time to spend with him.  Their fear and fear for the baby is covered by their courage and will to not give up hope.  Michael seems to care a little too much for Skellig.  If he were a normal kid, he probably would have told his parents about a strange man in the garage.  But, perhaps he didn't tell because Skellig was just the person whom he could confide in and talk about all his problems.  The book entertained me but also sent me messages, one being:  Love conquers all.  The book was written for juveniles and I gave it four stars for being an excellent book for young adults but an entirely intelligent, historic, life-changing novel.  The book moved me, it flowed smoothly, and had a very good plot with important messages, but the characters are very young and I couldn't really relate to them.  The thing I liked most about the book is the mood Almond creates.  He can make you feel very happy and joyous and also very sad.  Every time I would read it I would want to go out and get some Chinese food.  I think he has ties with a Chinese restaurant.  You think?  I would recommend this book to anyone from age nine to fifteen.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't believe Firefly was cancelled! I am the first to dislike Westerns, but this gem caught my attention and never let go.<br />I fell intrigued and in love with the characters and developments.  I wish it could come to some kind of conclusion... Perhaps a movie... Oh wait... One's on it's way! I can't wait. For now, pick this DVD set up.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This naked version is quite interesting. Like it or not is a more natural sounding recording than the original album from 1970. Nevertheless, is just a possible approach to the final result. After all, We could have had every one of the Beatles remix the album and we would have end up with four different versions that could, very well, be diferent one from the other.<br />This version tries to present a more true approach to the band's original intention in terms of sound. Less studio and more live playing. The results are, in my opinion, a window that lets you appreciate the past and its influence on the present. The Beatles actually sound like a modern alternative rock band. This approach lets you, once again, marvel at the deepth of the Beatles influence in rock and how they were able to influence and inspire so many musicians even today as I write this note.<br />I have not had a chance to listen to the extra material CD but I really does not considered to be anything special. I guess only the Let it Be music is worth the buy.
0316666343|4.0|This was a well written book. It makes you notice how important family is and what coping with death or murder is like for family members. Alice Sebold does a great job setting up the storyline and her descriptions of character and events throughout the story made it easier for me to visualize them.  The storyline was good but I didn't like her descriptions of how life in heaven was. She described heaven as like living in the dorms in college. This book would have been better if Sebold focused more on the mystery of Susie's death. If you're a reader who enjoys reading about mysteries and drama, I would recommend this book to you.
B00008G9JM|5.0|A Passion Play is a muiscal masterpiece, equal to its counterpart concept album &quot;Thick AS A Brick&quot;.  Although I may think its great others may not because its very UNIQUE style, Ian shows us how extremely diverse and yet exceptional his song writing can be. The Story of &quot;The Hare who lost his Spectacles&quot; is amusing and is supposed be, so don't whine about it. The album is not for everyone, so if you don't like twenty minute long songs, or didn't like the other Tull concept album &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; than don't buy this one.  However if you already own this album and do enjoy it, you may also enjoy &quot;NightCap&quot; which includes the first failed attempt of this album and a sseperate disc of rare Tull tracks.
079284131X|4.0|I would say on many levels Child's Play works and for good measure since it all takes something from are childhood and turns it into a nightmare. Some say this is not scary aand to tell you truth if you just look at it it is not however (since I tend to think about movies)the idea of something trying to kill me and is hiding and im in a dark small apartment in chicago does. Thats how the movie works it dives into fears that we all have been through.However what does not work is something I ponder for a long time I feal that the writers at one point clearly wanted us to think it was andy doing all these killings and if they did they failed big time also if you are trying to do that dont put a doll waving a knife in the air(in other countrys specially europe they had just a case of the good guy doll)
B000002UAR|5.0|As a young Beatle fan in 1966 living in the U.S.  I naturally bought all their records.  However, the vinyl REVOLVER album I bought in '66 (I still have it) was great, but this U.K. version of the REVOLVER now available on CD is REALLY great.  What's different?   The addition of 3 Lennon songs (&quot;And Your Bird Can Sing,&quot; &quot;I'm Only Sleeping,&quot; and &quot;Doctor Robert&quot;) that were NOT included on the REVOLVER album that was originally released in America back then.  They were included on the basterized Capitol album released in spring 1966 (and as I can see, no longer available on Amazon as a CD) called YESTERDAY, AND TODAY.  It was supposed to have that famous photo of the boys in their butcher suits holding carved up dolls, but instead they released another photo, because that was so controversial.  The YESTERDAY, AND TODAY album (obviously never approved of by the Beatles, and maybe contributing to their disgust with the music industry) also contained &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; another great Lennon single that was NEVER included on RUBBER SOUL in America.  So the CD versions of both REVOLVER and RUBBER SOUL available on Amazon are quite superior to the original vinyl albums that were released in America, and which left off important Lennon tracks.
0393057658|4.0|As an avid fan of Bill James in the 1970s and 1980s, I have been constantly dismayed by the lack of respect given to his skilled analysis and observation of the game of baseball in his various writings over the years, including the now highly acclaimed Baseball Abstract.  An interesting parallel can be drawn to another book, written on another subject almost 40 years ago, a book called Beat The Dealer by Dr. Edward Thorpe.  <br />Dr. Thorpe, after many years of study and computer analysis, wrote his book in 1966 which factually explained how proper play and the use of card counting could defeat the casinos in the game of blackjack.  It demythologized the long-held beliefs that only luck and money systems like the truly stupid Martingale could win at blackjack.<br />The book, which is completely and totally based in pure mathematical fact, was ignored by the &quot;old men&quot; of the casino business who &quot;knew&quot; that the house always had the edge.  It took many years (and many card counters winning lots of money) for the casinos to wise up and start to fight back, often by having their own people finally read Thorpe's (and his later followers) books.  <br />Once again, it is surprising it has taken so long for anyone in baseball to sit up and take notice of what those of us who followed sabremetrics and Bill James' analyses for many years always understood.<br />I agree with many of the reviews that Billy Beane is not portrayed as a particularly endearing person.  However, he seems to clearly understand what the facts are here, and acts on them.  This is the sign of a good manager and I expect his approach will win out in the long run.  And yes, he is right, just like in blackjack, the math will win in the long run (the full season), but it is hell in the short run.  Some reviewers have said that in the short run, you need to ignore what got you there and play a different game.  However, my experiences in blackjack suggest the opposite, that you have to accept that the short run involves a lot of luck and hope that over the long run (even in the long run of a series of short run playoffs), that the luck will eventually even out and that playing the solid game you always do will finally bear fruit.  But as someone who always played blackjack with a small bankroll, I know the variance sure plays havoc with your mind and can tempt you to go the wrong way.<br />One more point.  Someone said they hoped that every manager in baseball is made to read this book.  For the Oakland A's sake, I hope not, but even if they are, I doubt it will make much difference.  Thorpe's book was widely available to read by anyone for many years, and even the casino bosses I talked to who read it would simply tell you that it was wrong.  I expect that if every &quot;old man&quot; in baseball read this book, most would say it was something to be laughed at.  It will take a generation to change this and in the meantime, I hope Oakland (and others) can  ride the results to the bank (and the World Series).
B00006JKOM|5.0|This Album has been overly critizised and overlooked.  You just can't go wrong with &quot;Taxi Grab&quot;, &quot;Big Dipper&quot; and &quot;The Chequered Flag&quot;.  The title track is exceptional, and the two bonus tracks are great, especially &quot;A Small Cigar&quot;.  This is a VERY TULL sounding album, a fusion of the musical styles of WarChild and Minstrel in the Gallery. If you already own this album then listen to it again, and if you don't you should purchase it.
B000002J1I|3.0|It takes something going on, musically, to put out an album in 1978 about which 75 + people have different opinions and debates during the years!  That said, here's my take on it...<br />If you pretend this CD is a great single of \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" w/ \\"Release, Release\\" by the '70's bass-&-drum duo of Squire & White, with some bonus tracks, you'll really enjoy it.  <br />But I was one of the first people in my city to buy 1976/77's Going For the One, and have been head over heels in love with that album (CD) ever since.  Back in the day, I was eagerly awaiting the next dew drops from my music gods.  Tormato came out after about a year-and-a-half....and...well....I almost cried from disappointment.  The album opens with an...um...interesting...song(s), then somehow, even with two years to write & record, Jon & Co. seemed to be running away from the best they can be.  The production & keyboards are rather tinny; the album art is bizarre, but not in a good way; the majority of the songs sound hurriedly-written & produced; and what the heck was Jon thinking with the goofy, cartoonish \\"Circus of Heaven\\" & \\"Arriving UFO\\"?  Comedy relief?  \\"Onward\\" is an essentially beautiful song, but it wasn't recorded at its best until the \\"Keys to Ascension\\" live collection almost 20 years later.  <BR>But I digress.  Back to the imagined single...\\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\", which beautifully showcases the jaw-dropping musicianship & connectedness between Chris Sqire & Alan White, is alone worth the price of the CD; and \\"Release, Release\\" makes a great B-side - if you can get past the AOR wannabe lyrics (soul-cleansing words like \\"Master of Images/ Songs cast a light on you\\" from Going For the One's \\"Awaken\\" have given way to bubblegum-chomping \\"Rock is the medium of our generation\\") & focus on the killer drum & bass lines.  I give each of these two songs a star, plus one more star just because it's Yes & I got over my disappointment years ago.  Pretty much ;))  Like I said....it's really a great single with bonus tracks.
B000000WFF|5.0|i used to listen to them all the time and then they didnt play them on tv or radio anymore so i bought the cds again because someone stoled mine i still dont know why the group split up i love there music
B0000DD7NL|3.0|Ok, now I am a fan of Ms. Keys and I love the fact that she is trying to do real music. However I was not very impressed by this CD. There are too many songs on here that sound exactly like her last CD. Same chords, there is one song that is the same exact beat. I expected so much more from someone with her talent. I am not sure if this is a sign of her being held back by company people not willing to give her full artistic control.I was glad to see that she enlisted Kanye West for production, he mos def gives that old school feel that you hear on \\"you dont know my name\\". Sad to say but that is one of the best songs on the album. The titel track with the tonies is nice as well. A decent CD all the more, but not a 5 star by far
B00005NTJK|5.0|Benefit is one of the finest albums I have ever heard. If you enjoy the creative sounds of Jethro Tull, then you MUST BUY THIS ALBUM. Its that good!
B000088E6D|5.0|How anyone can say that this CD is not up to much is beyond me!<BR>OK so a couple of the songs have been covered by a few too many poor singers, but this chap does not fit that description. He may be only 25, but so what? He can sing, and this collection proves it!<BR>I would recommend it to anyone that needs an injection of quality music!
B000053VAF|2.0|After hearing that this film had offended many Christians, I decided to see it and find out. Being Christian myself, (protestant) I was curious.<br />I heard that this film was offensive particularly to Catholics. Not being Catholic, I wasn't sure of everything that would be offensive to them, but I can see why so many Catholics were offended.<br />It does have a few scenes that offended me, but there are plenty of other films which were far more offensive.<br />If you are devout Catholic, this movie will offend you. If you are a Protestant, this movie might offend you. If you are secular and like off-color humor, you will probably like this film.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is a great CD,1 of my favorie rappers. 2001 is 1 of my favorite CD's.The best songs are Big egos,still D.R.E.,the next episode,forgot about dre,the watcher,and whats the difference. Reccomended to any rap fan.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I watched this film with low expectations since so many sequels are disappointing, but was pleasantly surprised by exciting action sequences, a strong cast and interesting plot.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger reprises the role he was born to play, and he doesn't ham it up as much as he did in T2; Kristanna Loken looks great as the Terminatrix (though she shows too much emotion, I assume this was a directorial decision); Nick Stahl plays 22-year old John Connor as an angst-ridden anti-hero; Claire Danes is very good as Katherine Brewster, future resistance fighter (though she is made to scream and react a lot), particularly considering that she accepted the role a few days before shooting started!  Everyone is great, though Linda Hamilton is missed; to me she's as integral to the Terminator-mythos as Arnold. The script is fine -- with a plot consistent with the previous films, not as much mining for catchy one-liners, but too little on the time paradox aspect of the story.<br /><br />DVD extras include two commentary tracks -- one with director Mostow alone, the other with Mostow, Arnold, Loken, Daines and Stahl. Arnold's  intelligence (and his out-of-control ego) shine through in his lengthy monologues -- though who was going to tell him to take it down a notch?<br /><br />The best extra is an hysterical deleted scene, The Sargeant Candy scene, about the origins of the  T-1. There's also a trailer, a storyboard comparison, a Terminator timeline, a visual effects featurette, a video game trailer and making-of featurette, gag reel, featurettes on costumes and action figures, and a 13-minute eye-candy making-of documentary. The film can be heard in English or French and subtitled in English, French or Spanish.<br /><br />Enjoyable continuation of the Terminator franchise.
B00000263T|5.0|The surprise success of the song Balls to the Wall in 1984, brought into the spotlight, if only briefly, the German heavy metal band Accept.  Their sound was hard, crushing, uncompromising Euro style metal.  Fronted by camo-garbed vocalist Udo Dirkschnieder, the band featured the twin guitar talents of Wolf Hoffmann and Jorg Fischer.<br />Accept's 1985 follow up Metal Heart, features the band well within their established musical realm, but also branching out and exploring new territory.  The result, is one of the best heavy metal albums of the 80's.  The production is fantastic, yielding a sound is truly \\"heavy\\".  The recording offers musical variety, and some outstanding songs.  Vocalist Dirkschneider is effective either screeching out lyrics, or delivering them in a strained menacing growl.  The guitar work is powerful, as lead guitarist Hoffmann brings virtuosity and emotion to his solos.<br />The music hits hard, perhaps none more so than Midnight Mover.  The pattern of the main riff is unique, and catchy.  Hoffmann's solo is a memorable, ascending thing of beauty.  Teach Us to Survive, is another great song with an unusual structure, and haunting minor tones, that shows what this band is capable of.  \\"Finger snapping\\" in an Accept song?  Yes, and more thrills from Wolf on his brilliant solo.  Udo's snarling vocals punctuate this dark, brooding number.<br />Living for Tonight has some elements reminiscent of another German band, the Scorpions, with its powerful straight-ahead approach.  The midsong interlude with Udo's plaintive moans, is a prelude to another killer guitar solo and pounding outro, that should leave most headbangers satisfied.  Screaming for a Love-Bite features some perky chords, taking the band into unfamiliar territory, sounding almost (gasp!) \\"happy\\".  Once again, Wolf's twisting solo is another gem.<br />The title track, Metal Heart borrows from Beethoven, and is a pounding metal juggernaut.  Somewhat in the style of Balls to the Wall, Dogs on Leads is a menacing heavy number with more Dirkschneider growls and wails.  Want to rock out to a stomping groove?  Then Too High to Get It Right, and Up to the Limit should fit the bill nicely.<br />The music on Metal Heart is some of the finest, and most progressive, produced by the band.  Accept's music from the mid 80's period, is among the best examples of heavy Euro style metal.  With Udo Dirkschneider, Accept's music was delivered with an attitude.  Besides Accept, aficionados are also encouraged to check out the music of Dirkschneider's group U.D.O., and Running Wild, another German heavy metal band.gs on Leads is a menacing heavy number with more Dirkschneider growls and wails.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Brilliant. Captures a few days in the lives of a middle-aged actor and a beautiful young philosophy student who connect in Japan. The stream-of-life direction, the subtle and natural dialogue, the beautiful and haunting cinematography of Japan and the wonderful music make this like watching a dream. The movie, it's sweetness, bittersweet joy and subtle characters, stayed with me for days like a great novel.<br />Bill Murray gives maybe his best performance ever, nuanced, expressed, understated. Joyous, uplifting, honest. Makes you glad to be alive.
B00005A46T|5.0|I have already wrote 1 review on this CD,but I am going to write another one.This is great.Its better than thier 1st CD.The best nu-metal band. I hope they go on tour with Mushroomhead,I would buy tickets.The best songs are people = sh*t,everything ends,disasterpiece, and I am hated,but all the songs are great.So if you are into the nu-metal genre,than I strongly reccomend checking these guys out.
B00006LLNU|5.0|With their 2002 release...let's call it \\"Parentheses,\\" Sigur Ros has taken a massive step forward as the next Radiohead. I'm sure Sigur Ros would be appalled by that statement, but nonetheless it's exactly where they are headed despite their extreme efforts to be anti-pop. <br />Putting all self-servicing art-for-sake-of-itself nonsense aside, this is perhaps one of the finest records I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. On their previous offerings I felt the \\"songs\\" were too ambient and were never really developed as complete ideas. It was hard to find a discernible motif anywhere and you had the impression they were making it up as they went along.<br />On ( ) they develop their brilliant ideas more fully, and often entire songs are based around a simple repeating piano motif, which they build from a whisper to a scream, and back to a whisper over the course of seven minutes. The production is always bordering on the outer threshold of experimentation; you are sure to hear things you've never heard before. However, they present these unique sounds in a completely accessible way, so although it's new it is also intimately familiar. That, in a statement, is the definition of musical genius. <br />The highlights on the record are tracks 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8. I guess it would've been easier to say what *isn't* a highlight, but that's just how this record is. To me, the far and away best song is track 4 (I'm not giving song names because each track is \\"Untitled\\"), which in seven and a half minutes embodies everything that is spectacular about this record and this band.<br />Some other interesting tidbits...<br />- There are no lyrics on this record. Some listeners have mistakenly reported that Jónsi, the lead singer, sings in Icelandic. He is actually singing in a language he calls \\"Hopelandic\\" which is nothing more than an academic name for random syllables. Many times songs are written this way, with the singer just letting whatever comes out come out, and then replacing the meaningless syllables with actual words. Jónsi has forgone this last step and instead considers his soaring Thom Yorke-ish falsetto to be more of an instrument than lead vocal.<br />- Allegedly, the songs on this record were inspired by ancient Viking poetry.<br />- Jónsi, who is also the lead guitarist, uses a cello bow on his guitar to achieve the ambient, floating overtones. <br />- There is a thirty-second gap of silence after track 4. This is to separate the album from its \\"sweet\\" half into its \\"heavy\\" half.<br />I haven't mentioned being annoyed with the overt self-importance of the record - not including song titles, not including an album title, separating the album into halves, etc. - and I won't go into too much musing about it. I will say this - Sigur Ros isn't exactly helping an anti-pop image by doing this. At first it will be appreciated only by the \\"alternative\\" folk, and then the college kids will discover it and it will become pop, thus considered \\"uncool\\" by those that originally lauded it although nothing about it has changed. This is the typical pattern of genius. <br />Sigur Ros should just accept the inevitable. They are far too talented and ingenious to not eventually be recognized as superstars.
B000003S5H|5.0|If music, i mean in a broad term, no matter what style, epoch, should be represented by one song, La Femme d'Argent would be the one. Perfection.
0393057658|4.0|Some people seem to think Moneyball is mostly about Billy Beane being a genius, and as such there has been some backlash from those who don't see him that way. I don't think that's what the book is really about - it's about how a smart guy (Beane) figured out how to stay competitive with less money to spend than the competition. Essentially, Beane figured out what types of players are undervalued and spent his money there. It's hard to argue with the results in the regular season, although the team hasn't won in the playoffs.<br />Moneyball also talks about Bill James, my favorite baseball writer. James labored for years developing theories that were mostly ignored by the baseball establishment. Now many of James' ideas (and those of other sabermetricians) are being accepted by sportwriters, broadcasters and general managers.<br />Moneyball isn't just about baseball. It's about business, about using new knowledge rather than discounting it, and about evaluating risk. Some of the ideas in Moneyball could be applied to other endeavors.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is 1 of my favorite nu-metal bands.This CD is great.I think Iowa is better but still this is a great CD.The best songs are Surfacing,Me inside,and wait and bleed.This is the heaviest band Ive ever heard.I wish they would go on tour with Mushroomhead.I would pick up tickets.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|The reason: \\"The Christmas Song\\" (track 2)<br />People can argue that her voice is messed up, that her life is a wreck, etc.  But when you get older and do things that damage your voice, your vocal chords are not the same as they were when you were a teenager.  So, if she can't hit the high notes like she used to, it's not really that much of a surprise.<br />But what is a surprise is how she makes up and seems to mispronounce words.  \\"Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow... will find is hard to SLEEVE tonight.  Yaba Daba Laba Raba\\"  This is where the song gets good.  Then, she goes on to sing, \\"To see if REINDEERS really know how to fly.\\"  Then the ending is just a little creepy as she whispers merry Christmas.<br />Similar amusing vocal effects happen on the next track \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" and probably on the rest of the cd, I just can't get through it all.<br />This cd ends up being a caricature of Whitney and gives MadTv an overabundance of material to amuse us with.  When she needed something to prove that she's a functional member of society and still a vocal powerhouse, a nonsensical woman has delivered a musical joke.
B00005JM02|5.0|There are those reviews before this which tell parents of young children to avoid this film because of some 'violent' aspects to the movie that may me too much to handle. However Bambi, a legendary Disney movie, shows a mother deer being killed by a hunter, an aspect that, for me, is far more violent than a fish being eaten. I believe Finding Nemo belongs in the ranks of Bambi and Lion King as one of Disney's masterpieces. The best Disney movies are those involving 90-100% animal casts with little human intervention. From start to finish this film is brilliant. The animation is unrivaled in any film to date, and the storyline stands on its own. Far from being flimsy, this is a story of loss, strife, finding one self, independence, responsibility, and family. The story is beautiful and can move you and then humor you at the drop of a dime. The story is swift, but moves at a comfortable pace for its audience. This is a captivating film in every aspect; continuing the success of Pixar/Disneyp partnership, but also proving that Disney is able to craft a film which explores the depths of human emotion and places it in a context in which young and old can allow their imaginations to be freed and can embrace a film that will be treasured by generations to come for its awesome animation and the touching and humorous tale it weaves from beginning to end. Pick this up NOW!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm glad there's the DVD's and the episodes in the DVD's that never aired- looking forward to watching them all!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I liked this show so much that I wanted to in this case. The characters are interesting and well developed, the world is creative and interesting, and the plots were intense. I wish the show had been given a chance to catch on because it was killed way too early.
B000000W5P|5.0|this is the fourth &quot;some girls&quot; recording i purchased because it's a &quot;must have&quot; cd. i purchased the tape in 1980 and played it to death, bought another and had it stolen from my car. when the cd came out i purchased it only to have it stolen from my home. this is the fourth purchase and i never get tired of listening to it.<br />aside from &quot;miss you&quot;, i love every song and consider this collection a total &quot;sing-along&quot; type of recording. each song feels like a group of guys could be singing in the background and having a great time.<br />it's an uplifting, energetic cd that will amaze. i was never a hardcore stones fan, although i respected them, but this album is awesome.
B000000NN1|5.0|I'll begin with saying that Vangelis has brought the most beautiful melodies out synthesizers that I've ever dreamt of.  Jon Anderson's angelic voice and his touching lyrics only add to the beauty and the overwhelming integrity of this album.  The song 'So Long Ago, So Clear' is easily one of the best pieces I've ever heard.  This is the only song on this album that features Jon Anderson.  I think that this song fits in with the rest of the album very well.  After years and years of listening to this album on my dad's turntable, I decided to purchase it on CD.  The quality of the recording is good, and the cover of the album is very nice as well.  If you like this album and this style of music, then I'd definitely recommend other albums by Vangelis such as &quot;Private Collection&quot; and &quot;The Friends of Mr. Cairo&quot;.  Both of these feature Jon Anderson.  Absolutely amazing....
6305364613|1.0|I can't give much of a review for this movie.  I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes and turned it off after 20 min.  It was chaotic and trying to hard to be hip and up to date.  I can appreciate chaotic movies, Nowhere was one of my personal favs.  but when applied to something with a solid storyline, it just makes the story tertiary to what is going on visually.  admittedly I had a bias to begin with, not necessarily with leo, but with the story, romeo and juliet was never my fav shakesperean story.  but I think it could have been so much better.  That and drop the LA gangbanger thing, that was just too MTV.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I've been a Sci-Fi fan since I first learned to read.  My wife, on the other hand, hates the genre.  She wouldn't watch television with me if she saw &quot;that little planet in the corner of the screen&quot; (Sci-Fi Channel), refused to watch any of the Star Trek or Star Wars or Star Anything films.<br />And then came Firefly.<br />She started watching it with me, from the the series premier.  At first, it was to humor me.  Then she got into it.  Then she got royally angry when the show was cancelled.  Even she was surprised at how much she enjoyed the series.  It should say something about how well the show was written if a person who clames to despise Science Fiction can be drawn in.<br />The characters were well-developed, and unique.  Even if you describe them as a cliche &quot;gunfighter&quot;, &quot;doc&quot;, &quot;preacher&quot;, they were all so much more.  And the show was somehow able to develope those character profiles without beating you over the head in the process.  Each flashback or insight into their thoughts was done so flawlessly that you couldn't help but be impressed.<br />I had no idea that this complete set was going to be released, but I know where my wife and I will be when our copy arrives:  Curled up on the couch and completely entranced.<br />Trust me on this.  Buy it.  Just buy it.
B000002BE9|4.0|Whenever I think of this album, besides thinking that it's amazing, I think how of how deep &quot;Fiona Apple&quot; is beyond her years. She was 18 when this came out! The smoothness of this album, the musicianship, and of course that voice, all simply stunning. The first track &quot;Sleep To Dream&quot; has one of my favorite lyrics: &quot;You say love is a hell and you cannot bare, and I say give me mine back, and then go there for all I care&quot;. The hit here is &quot;Criminal&quot;, but other songs like &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; and &quot;Never Is A Promise&quot; are just as good. I highly suggest getting this album. It'll go great with your &quot;Tori Amos&quot; and &quot;Maxwell&quot; cd's.
0316096199|5.0|This memoir rang true to me. In no way is it a self help book, it probably won't help anybody 'get over it'. It reflects so closely my own experience of the detachement and the impact on my close familly that it was scary. I must say it was compelling for me to hear her story. Some readers have commented on the lack of advice on how to get over it, well, is she really over it? Are you?
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I give this two stars for some of the cinematography and the costumes.  But in every other way this movie is a mess.  Grossly overdone in the tradition of Natural Born Killers, a movie that gave new meaning to the cliche&quot;sometimes less is more&quot;.  I did want to like this movie, but it was far too chaotic and bloated.  Makes me wonder what the director is like in person.  plus I was dissapointed that this was supposed to be a musical and very little of the music was original, mostly covers of pop music.  The visuals though interesting at times jumped from one idea to another too quickly making me dizzy.  The main characters were also a bit vapid, even for protagonists in a love story.
B000000OAA|5.0|Queen's third album continues the grandiosity they started and continued with the first two albums. Although, we can smell a bit of a departure from the conceptual rock-opera scenario towards the more straightforward songs that Queen had become so famous for. The album opens with Brighton Rock, the song that eventually gave way to Brian May's unique guitar solo for years to come. Killer Queen follows as the album's first single, and the band's first US hit. Tenement Funster, a GREAT rock tune sung by drummer Roger Taylor, is simply amazing, and one of those songs that Queen never played live. What a shame. Flick of the Wrist is a hard rocker with some more frenetic guitar work. Lily of the Valley is a simply gorgeous ballad from Freddie, and then we launch into Now I'm Here, one of Queen's biggest hits that lived in their live sets till the end of their great span.<br />Side two punches you in the face with the opera-vocals of Lap Of The Gods. Stone Cold Crazy is next, a HUGE heavy-metal number that has been covered by many bands over the years, including Metallica. Dear Friends is a beautiful little piano ballad. Misfire is the first offering from Bassist John Deacon, who shows that he too can write wonderful songs. Bring Back That Leroy Brown is the first 'silly' song from Queen (but no less amazing), that paved the way for many of the wonderful songs found on Night At The Opera. The album closes out with She Makes Me, anothe rgorgeous Brian May song that never made it to the live set, and In The Lap Of The Gods...revisited, that closed out all Queen shows until We Are The Champions came around.<br />A classic release from one of the world's greatest bands.
B00008NRLX|4.0|It's one of those times when you feel like an album was custom made just for you. The style, the lyrics, the &quot;autumn day&quot; feel of the whole thing. Each song is so well crafted, with a voice to match. I can easily say that 10 of these 14 songs are excellent, so I won't start naming them. If you're an old fan of the &quot;Byrds&quot;, or &quot;C.S.N.Y.&quot;, and feel like bands don't make music the way they used to, pick this one up. Fans of &quot;Wilco&quot; and &quot;Ryan Adams&quot; should dig it too.

B0000B1OFL|3.0|The casting is decent, although I admit that I was worried when I saw the list. Edward Norton may be the best actor of the last century, and Charlize Theron has given some solid performances. But I was skeptical about Seth Green and Jason Statham, neither have had a stellar movie career. They were however fantastic, in fact they were highlights to the film.<br />The only slight blemish was a few gaping plot holes (nothing new these days from any movie) and the performance by Mark Wahlberg. Marky Mark showed very few emotional responses and did little to impress me, I know he can do better. Boogie Nights is a classic and I really liked him in the Corruptor. But he seemed quite reserved in his role as the leader of the group of thieves.<br /><br />The car chase scene is phenomenal, don't skip it. In fact this movie is worth watching for that scene alone.
B00013RC8O|5.0|The story begins at the end, where we are shown a roadblock of monstrous proportions, and a white 1970 Dodge Challenger rocketing toward it.  From there the tale begins, backing up two days to give the rest of the story.  An interstate chase is on for the driver of the Challenger, whom we know nothing at all about.  As the story unfolds, the identity of the driver is rationed out in flashbacks and news reports, slowly bringing into focus the nature of the character.  At first, we naturally assume the driver to be a simple car thief, as does law enforcement.  Gradually, we learn that the driver is not a thief at all, he is simply delivering the car. He is a decorated Vietnam veteran who joined the police department after his honorable discharge, married a beautiful girl, and then lost her in a surfing accident.  Not long after, he stopped a senior officer from beating and raping a young hippie girl, and was dishonorably discharged from the force.  We also learn that his high-octane burn across the desert is to satisfy a simple wager: if he makes it from Denver to San Francisco in less than 15 hours, he doesn't have to pay for the amphetamines he bought to keep him awake for the trip.  He is guided along the way by blind disc jockey \\"Supersoul\\" (Cleavon Little), who speaks to the driver (whose name is we learn is Kowalski (no last name given, via the AM radio in the Challenger.  Supersoul is Kowalski's invisible guardian angel, advising him of the cop's attempts to stop him, at least until some local rednecks bust into the radio station with a storm of rocks and racial epithets and beat Super Soul and his engineer into submission.  As Kowalski rockets across the blasted desert landscape, he encounters numerous crackpots and visionaries, all of whom seem to offer another piece to the puzzle that Kowalski's life has become.  From prospectors to faith healers, outlaws to newlywed hijackers, we are given a glimpse into a world that exists far from the beaten track we alltravel each day.  As Kowalski hurtles toward his date with the destiny that was mapped out for us at the very beginning of the film, each rumor and news report seems to contradict the image of him that is being played out by the police of several states, elevating him to something of a folk hero among a growing legion of fans and supporters.    This movie knocked me out from the very beginning.  For those die-hards, yes, there are plenty of car chases and stunts to satisfy most fans of car/action films.  But that's not the whole story, by any measure.  For this is the story of one man, not a mythic legend, or even a regional folk hero.  Why does he do what he does?  He simply has nothing left to lose or gain.  How many men returned from Vietnam at least a little disillusioned by the world they came home to?  How many have had their lives mapped out neat and pretty, only to have the blind monkey wrench of fate turn their worlds upside down?  Here is a man who is perfectly willing to sacrifice his freedom, his safety, and possibly even his life to win what amounts to a ten-dollar bet, at best.  When Kowalski finally arrives at the roadblock, the inevitable conclusion to his odyssey, he takes the only road he knows, a path which had been set for him ever since the beginning.    On a cinematic level, the influence of Vanishing Point is far reaching, indeed.  The story of a jaded ex-cop who has lost his wife, his hope and, to a degree, his humanity, was taken and nitro-injected in George Miller's Mad Max (1979) and the Road Warrior (1982), as Max Rockatansky (not too far a reach from Kowalski) has his life violently ripped out from under him, and thus turns to the open road. At first for revenge, but then because it is the only world he can exist in, a place where jungle law prevails.  By then, Max is nothing more than a shell, a ghost of a human who haunts the blighted landscape propelled by a hunger not even he can understand.  One of the most effective plot devices isthat of not giving the protagonist a name until well into the film.  Joel Schumaker used this technique very well in his good movie Falling Down (1993), not giving Michael Douglas' character a name until the final act of the film's story.  By doing this, we are allowed to see the character as a sort of everyman, someone whom we may know, or may even be.  We are then free to observe the goings-on at a much more personal level, knowing all too well that the story being played out upon the screen could, given the right circumstances, be any of us, and to that end, possibly even all of us.  By the time we learn that the character is someone, it's too late.  They are already a part of us, bound by destiny and experience.  Also of note is the using of a disc jockey to provide a running commentary on the nature and exploits of the protagonist (as well as provide a reasonable source for the music in the film), a device used, to lesser effect, in Walter Hill's The Warriors (1979).  Lastly, although film characters have been bumping into oddballs in the desert for years, Abbe Wool's wonderful Roadside Prophets (1992) stands out as the protagonists wander through the desert, encountering numerous wisdom-dispensing desert dwellers, each contributing their ideas, ideals, and experiences in a way that lends toward a larger collective ideology wherein a greater truth resides.     This is a masterpiece of filmmaking.  Do yourself a huge favor and check it out.
B00001ZULV|4.0|Yes, this is missing alot, but if you're a casual fan of the bands &quot;Phil Collins&quot; years, this will give you your &quot;Phil&quot;. All the obvious hits are here, but my favorites are &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;, &quot;Misunderstanding&quot;, and &quot;Throwing It All Away&quot;. So while this may not be the &quot;Best Of Genesis&quot;, it should please the 1980's and top 40 fans. Plus it's 18 tracks, which makes it kind of hard to complain. If you still need more &quot;Phil Collins&quot;, check out his own solo collection, also brilliantly titled &quot;Hits&quot;.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This film is not merely a &quot;bad&quot; movie.  There are plenty of them around.  What makes &quot;Hulk&quot; so remarkable is the phenomenal amount of effort (and money) that went into making this movie so incredibly terrible.  Making a film is a collaborative effort, and as someone who works in the industry, I was amazed at just how awful every aspect of that collaboration was.  It is truly rare to collect horrendous writing, acting, set design, direction, editing, makeup, effects, and all other aspects of production in one picture.<br />Everyone who wisely skipped this in the theatre should not make the mistake of purchasing this DVD.  Luckily I rented it, and more luckily, I have a fast forward button on my remote control.  Other than providing yourself with a new, mind-blowing bench-mark for how terrible a film can be (there are several moments when I had to rewatch shots because I was in utter disbelief that anyone had let such an awful thing make it to the finished product), this film serves no purpose and you will be wasting valuable time that would be better spent spinning in a circle while staring at the floor.<br />As for all the compliments about the visual style, as someone who makes a living in the business, I instantly go on alert any time someone starts talking about the craft of movie-making.  As in any art form, for the product to be successful, no lay-person should notice the craft.  When critics start talking about the music or the editing, you can be sure that the composer or the editor screwed up, because they drew attention to their work instead of supporting the story in an invisible fashion.  All the talk about the brilliant visual style of &quot;Hulk&quot; is very much in that vein.  Yes, the director and editor desperately cry &quot;look at me&quot; with an endless barrage of wildly inane and infantile shots (a cardboard cutout villain surrounded by flames is a truly amazing moment in movie history, for all the wrong reasons), but the mere fact that you have no choice but to be distracted and &quot;look at them&quot; marks a massive failure in story-telling.  Not that the story, as cliched, boring, and (above all) incoherent as it is, was worth telling.  Stay far, far away from this horendous turkey.
0385504209|2.0|Three people recommended this book to me so with anticipation I read it over the course of a few days. It is an acceptable mystery that moves along although some of the dialog is amateurish or maybe just aimed at the poorly educated reader. There is quite a bit of repetition so that at points in the novel where I would normally have read very carefully I was able to quickly breeze through because I knew the same idea would be repeated several times in the next few pages.<br />The symbolism uses such loose associations that it is difficult to believe if not downright scary that people buy into it so thoroughly. Finally as only a wedding, funeral, and holiday churchgoer the ideas about the early days of Christianity were of little interest. When the movie is released, I will be sitting at home reading something more thought provoking.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I know &quot;Incubus&quot; has been around a few albums, and that they were a bit heavier before, but I never cared until I heard &quot;Morning View&quot;. Im really impressed with the talent, and ability to craft a moving song, as well as rock. The hits &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, and &quot;Warning&quot; are all on this, as well as the mellow &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, and my favorite &quot;Are You In?&quot;. Then it ends with the beautiful &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;, I'm really glad they had the guts to make this song. This album definitely won me over, and it shows a growth and maturity that most of us would consider to be better. Nice cover too.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have been a fan of Britney Since I was in the 6th grade. I own each of her cds and they keep getting better. I really like the song \\"Everytime\\". If you are a britney fan, get this cd! You wont be disapointed! It has a bit of everything from Pop to dance!!
1577311523|5.0|I've read many books on spirituality but Eckhart's books had the biggest impact on me.<BR>So far I've recommended The Power of Now to two of my friends and they were very thankful.<BR>This book is loaded with many 'Aha' moments.
B0000AFX64|3.0|First, some comments,<br />In a nutshell, the powers that be at Universal clearly don't respect BG.  It shows in the way thay have tried to draw more money into their coffers by marketing sub-standard DVDs (no extra secenes, no interviews, no trailers, mono sound when it would be easy to convert to Dolby Stereo, REAL WIDESCREEN, etc.)<BR>I was in college when the TV movie was shown, and it was excellent!  I know I felt that if a series like this could be made, there would not be any problem in getting Star Trek back on the small screen.  <BR>The story was great; references to American history (13 original colonies), Greek Mythology (Appolo, Athena, warrior helmets, etc.), The Bible (Adama, Baltar's co-conspiritor Chrybdis (spelled with a &quot;K&quot;), the Exodus from the colonies, Commander Cain), the Horoscope (Caprica, Taurus, Saggitara, etc.) was a stroke of genius!  <BR>The inclusion of a black man a Executive Officer and trusted friend and frearless warrior (Tighe and Boomer) was a true first in sci-fi.  Having an officer who was a Big and Tall person contribute with equal skill (Tony Swartz as Jolly-PC alert!) made me feel that talent and skill can supercede apparances.  <BR>The family values shown will inspire me to be a better person, especially now in these times.  The Late Lorne Greene was born to be Adama, a Ben Cartwright for the end of the millenia.  The Late John Colicos, as well, was the perfect villian-the traitor of mankind (notice how soft his voice is in the movie while in the presence of the Quarum of the Twelve, then the sharpness when looking out upon the destroyed colony, in conversation with a Cylon).<BR>I'm not going to mention the speciall effects; there has been enough said about the great quality, and it is true.  I just wish that Universal will stop disrespecting the fans of BG and give us a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; on the level of a Star Trek DVD that will have them treat us as something more than the bottom line in a ledger.Buy the VHS.  It has the best sound, a picture that holds up well and with lowering prices, a bargain, to boot!
B00007KMP1|5.0|this is one of the best albums ever recorded.  it is flawless.  gorgeous composition, poignant lyrics.  love it.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|There's a LOT of stuff in this box set.  Almost too much, really.  You could spend a couple of weeks watching and reading all the extras, commentaries, script drafts, etc.  But by then you would have deconstructed the films so much that you have robbed them of whatever &quot;innocent viewing pleasure&quot; you enjoyed before you delved into the minutiae of the extra features.<br />So it is a double-edged sword:  Learn more than you ever thought you would about the 4 &quot;Alien&quot; films, but suffer having to watch them from then on and forever more through the filter of &quot;knowing too much behind-the-scenes info&quot; &amp; &quot;curtain-pulled-back-on-the-Wizard&quot; insider perspective.<br /><br />That said, it is a real treat to have this collection, even though the fourth film was abominably disappointing.  The packaging, which opens to a nearly five foot long foldout, is kind of neat but soon grows cumbersome and irritating.  When you unfold it the first time, it is like &quot;Hey, look what THIS thing does!&quot;.  But after a while, when you just want to retrieve a single disc for some occasion, it has evolved to &quot;Okay, okay, I get it - it's long.  Just gimme the stupid disc already!&quot;<br />For &quot;Alien&quot; fanatics, this is a must-have.  I don't own the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot; set, so I can't compare them.<br />I especially like the DTS sound on two of the films.  DTS always brings a new dimension to the listening experience that the still-great Dolby 5.1 doesn't.<br />Don't complain about the price, either.  You get your money's worth in spades, and you save on tax and get free shipping if you order it online (from the right vendor).  Besides, even if the price is a bit too steep for you, that amount of your money would have been lost to the sands of time soon enough anyway.  Might as well spend the money and have something cool to show for it.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|ybooby (steve myers) is a heavy metal IDIOT!  He no have ze right to rate this cd!  it is verr good.  I give 4/5
B00009V7T2|3.0|I heard about this CD from a friend with whom I share similar musical interests.  I'm not familiar with At the Drive in or any other bands like them, so I'm not approaching this CD with any preconceptions of what &quot;it should be.&quot;  While my friend loves the CD, I'm much less impressed with it.<br />My main problem is that the CD is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too over-produced.  I don't have a problem with fancy, spacey production, but when your producer is making 2/3rds of the sound on your CD it's just overkill.<br />The playing itself is very good, the drumming especially stands out as being particularly good.<br />The guitar doesen't impress me as much, but the use of constantly shifting time scales keeps it interesting.  I just wish they'd go more places with the actual chord progression.<br />I don't mind the singing unlike alot of people I know that have heard this CD, but I think the lyrics are crap.  They make 1980's King Crimson lyrics seem like Shakespeare.<br />I think this band really has the potential to be a top-notch prog act, as they truly are progressive rock, unlike most of the current bands taking up the label.  I just think they need to let the music stand on it's own more, without production making the sound seem fuller and more dynamic than it actually is.
B0000669JL|5.0|I think no music collection can be complete without a little Bob Marley and this c.d. offers all of his best work.
0441009425|3.0|I have been waiting to discover an heir to Arthur C. Clarke's mantle for some time.  Reynolds almost made it.  The problem is, his book is just way too long.  It would have been an outstanding read at about 200 pages.  At almost 500 pages you have plenty of time to get bogged down and to become disenchanted.  There was too much unneeded detail, detail that demonstrated a vivid imagination but did not contribue to the entertainment value of the novel.  What happened to the 160 page gems that Clarke used to write.  Is this a lost art.  Two trends I deplore in modern science fiction writing: the tendency toward ponderous, verbose novels and the pre-occupation in their pages with political intrigue and factional infighting.  This novel is touched by both of these to varying degrees.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|While I love Michael Caine, the original Italian Job was just overall goofy, for today's standards, and the heist wasn't believable, as he had poor technology, a fat blubbering professor, an inept Mafia at his tail, too little money to divvy up amongst a bus full of incompetent nincompoops, and a brain-dead girlfriend. All of which would have better made a Brit Com series than an action movie.<BR> I was reluctant to see this movie when I heard it was coming out... Until my Original Italian Job-loving (and MINI loving, to boot) Dad bought it. I watched it and it was brilliant!<BR> Suspend disbelief for a while and just enjoy the possibility of mastermind thieves and safe-crackers pulling one over the ever-sleezeball-portraying Norton, and getting away with MINI loads of gold bars.<BR> Mark Wahlberg plays well the cunning master-thief Charlie Croker and Donald Sutherland gets an all-too-short, but very well-acted role as the surrogate dad for Charlie, sometimes better than his role as dad for his daughter Stella.<BR> I enjoyed the mix of characters and thought Charlize Theron does a good job as grieving daughter Stella trying to keep away from everything that reminds her of her father, including Charlie. The writers did a good job holding off on cheezy love scenes that so easily could have been inserted in tender, vulnerable moments between the Stella and Charlie.<BR>The others play well with and off each other, from the goofy Seth Green as the resentful ex-Napster Lyle, to a half-deaf loveable Left Ear, and a swaggering smooth-talker of a Brit in Handsome Rob. This small group of characters, as opposed to the large posse Michael Caine had around him, would more believably go along with the heist for a large chunk of the more abundant millions.<BR> While the only resemblance to the original is the three red, white and blue MINIs (originally a nod to the Union Jack), and the heist through a traffic jam (a traffic jam in LA is much more believable than the one in the original, and I thought the writers did a good job reworking that), and a wee bit of Italy in the beginning, this movie holds its own as an original, fun, fast-paced joy ride.<BR>Don't be too hard on the advertisers! It wasn't their idea to incorporate MINIs into the mix. It was from the original movie, after all. But hey, if it encourages you to buy a MINI and do some stunt driving in your own neck of the woods, please do! MINIs rock! And so did this movie. It's worth buying.
B000002A46|5.0|I bought Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas CD the second it came out in 1994.  I have listened to many Christmas CD's before this one and many after it.  But Mariah's Christmas CD has remained my favorite for almost a decade now.  I love the whole CD, but my top 3 are:<BR>1. All I Want For Christmas Is You <BR>2. O Holy Night <BR>3. Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)<BR>Mariah wrote 3 of the 10 tracks.  They are All I Want For Christmas Is You, Miss You Most At Christmas Time, and Jesus Born On This Day.  Mariah is an amazing singer and a gifted song writer and this CD reflects all of her creativity.  This CD is a must have for anyone's Christmas music collection.
B000059QY3|5.0|This opera comes at the height of Gheorghiu-madness, when she was a budding opera star coming full force onto the scene!<BR>This is the BEST sung La Traviata, at least on the female side. The often-painfully sung &quot;Follie... Sempre Libera&quot; is PERFECTION in beautiful Gheorghiu's hands, sung powerfully without strain or painful-sounding noises, er notes. =)<BR>The only weakness is a somewhat weak, nasally Alfredo. But Frank Lopardo is a great tenor despite this tendency.<BR>The elf-like late Sir Solti was a brilliant masterful conductor. <BR>Sets are minimal, acting is fantastic (as it happens, some of the best actors, like Pavarotti, are poor as actors), the singing is superb.<BR> Highly recommended!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|To Whittijim, <BR>First off, this is not metal, there is no rap, there is no thrash.  I don't know what you are listening to, but it certainly is not this cd.  <BR>Second this is a very deep emotional, and feeling cd.  You can feel the feelings and the lyrics flow through the music and Maynards voice.  I would call this cd beautiful, yet powerful.
B00008WG3U|4.0|The War on Errorism is definitely one of my favorite cds and if you buy it, it'll be one of yours as well. The band is very talented and no longer plays about random topics, they have entered the arena of politics. They take stabs at George Bush and his administration but still staying loyal to there roots with songs like shes stubs. The only thing I don't like is the drumming. There drummer should be alot better better if he has been playing for 20 years.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say about this show.  It is unbelievable.  I tend to be drawn to realistic dialogue and believable characters, and this show has them in abundance.  <br />The setting is 500 years in the future and 200 years in the past.  Sure there are times when there is a little cheese in this show, but it adds to the enjoyment.  That being said, if you are someone who must nit-pick at every technical detail and think that every television show should be derived from an anthropology textbook, then you might have trouble with the setting.<br />What is believable are the people.  Unlike most Sci-fi shows, this one has characters, who didn't finish at the top of their class, or do impossible things.  They are real people trying to make their way in the world and not always succeeding, and it makes for far more interesting television.<br />Technically it is brilliant, using old style camera techniques, to give it a &quot;retro&quot; feel, the lighting is some of the best put onto the small screen in a long while.  I has Emmy award winning special effects, are blended perfectly and by imitating camera zooms, rapid pans and even camera shudder the cg guys make you believe that real cameras are filming real ships.<br />If you are looking for the &quot;perfect future&quot; of Star Trek with it's sterile ships, steady cams shots and phasers, well you will be disappointed with this show. If you think that a show that combines Bladerunner, with a little bit of the Duke and a bit of the famous Joss Whedon wit, sounds interesting, this show won't disappoint.
B000001FKY|5.0|&quot;Hysteria&quot;, along with &quot;Pyromania&quot;, &quot;Retro Active&quot;, and &quot;High N' Dry&quot;, and &quot;Adrenalize&quot; are my favorite Def Leppard albums. They are the best band of all time, and I have all 10 of their albums, plus two imports. They are such a great band, no one can even hold a candle to Def Leppard. This was their biggest selling album, selling 17 million world wide, becoming the 29th best selling album of all time world wide, and 39th in America alone.Of course it was #1 on the charts for a couple of  months, and had seven hit singles. That's more than some people get in their whole career, and Def Leppard did it with one terrific album.No wonder they sold over 50 million albums world wide.Because they are the best.
B000088E6P|1.0|granted 50's been through a lot, but would he be where he is with out Dre's beats and guest appearances by Em? I most definately think not...bottle full of bub, come give me a hug? get serious! how many times have we had to &quot;party like its yo birfday&quot;...he's definately not one for originality...i been listening to REAL hip hop since i first saw RunDMC back in '85 and this is almost a disgrace...even for &quot;gangsta&quot; sh*t this is crappy...remember NWA and CMW? obviously 50 doesnt...and also, anyone who feels the necessity to type &quot;da&quot; instead of &quot;the&quot; in a review can hop on &quot;da&quot; bus with 50 and take a nice trip out of town...oh, and if y'all(?) think im a hater you're wrong, i dont hate any artist...i just think 50 would be better suited tearing tickets on the train or carrying my bags to my room at the Motel 6...give it a rest playa' fakers, 50 sucks...
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Okay...first off...I thought this was a great cd. One of her best. Some of her songs have been better though. Secondly, to everyone who said she's a bad artist, and her music sucks...get a life. I'm sure you have better things to do than making up reviews to post on the net about some singer you hate. I'd like to hear some of you make a hit record...but anyway...I liked the album.
B00000JSJC|5.0|It's a great movie about a guy who sells illusions through some kind of a headset to people who want to feel a variety of different feelings.

0385504209|5.0|A fantastic book, an easy read, and certainly thought-provoking. However, people should not make the mistake and take it as absolute truth, but do their own research. An interesting article is [...]<br />Nevertheless, a highly entertaining and interesting book.
B000067J24|1.0|Stupid scenario, bad production, medium performance.
0385504209|5.0|I kept putting off reading this book, even though I had heard all the hype.  Finally, my husband read it and loved it, so I decided I'd give it a try.  Wow.  I picked it up and didn't put it down until 5 hours later.  I didn't want to go to work the next day because I wanted to finish reading!!  I won't go over the plot line again - that has already been done.  This was just so well written - fresh material, fast moving plot, the various threads all get tied up in the end, but not in a pat, disappointing way, but in a way that still satisfies the reader.  I can't wait to read &quot;Deception Point&quot; and &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;!

B0000DJZA5|4.0|it Be&quot; was not their best &quot;album&quot; or even second best. In the film version  of the sessions they looked like a group on the verge of destruction. Listened to this with another old Beatlephile &amp; immediately started kibitzing, critiquing &amp; reminiscing. Just a bit mystical, listening in over 30 years later, two of the principals dead. It may take further listening in a  quiet atmosphere to make a more cogent review.<BR> While &quot;Let it Be&quot; sounds like the end, it wasn't.  It was merely the last released. It was Phil Specter's creation &amp; Paul for one didn't like it. &quot;Naked' is the Beatles chance to redo, more their vision &amp; better. The last, &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, is in my opinion, fresher, cleaner &amp; better than the original &quot;Let it Be&quot;,  The coolest bit in that version being John's comment at the end, up on the roof (you know it). You love the Beatles- dig it.
B00003CWTI|3.0|Seriously,this film's viewers are divided into two camps-the first camp finds the movie absolutely brilliant, and the second claims that its too confusing and drawn out. I disagree with both.First of all, this movie had a lot of potential to be brilliant and original, but there's a lot that stopped it, and we'll get to that. Secondly, I don't see what was so confusing or drawn out about the film.Sure the movie was long, but I found it surprisingly engrossing, and even easily entertaining.The movie didn't feel long. I thought everything about the movie worked.The script was fresh, and heartfelt, and really made you listen, and there were some pretty unique approaches to things.The problem with this film was the acting.Some of the performances were flat out incredible.Phillip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reily stole the show completely with genuinely emotional and real yet understated performances.Their performances are truly what save this movie.If only every performance had been on this caliber, I would've given this film 5 stars off the bat. Unfortunately, that is not so.Particularly what ruins this film are two actors, who ironically are the ones getting praised.Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore.Tom starts out strong enough, but as the movie calls for him to be more dramatic, he goes into overwrought territory with very little depth but a whole lot of shaking and screaming that may pass of as genuine emotion for some movie-goers, but does not cut it for me.Another problem, is Julianna Moore. Now, I literally wanted to jump in during the film and smack her across the face.She was playing the young trophy wife of a sick man on his deathbed.She was popping pills, and was feeling a lot of regret for marrying this man at the time for his money.Why did I not feel any of that?All I felt was Julianne Moore, \\"THE ACTRESS\\" trying to show off how good she was, walking around screaming and throwing around the f-word more times than does happen on a Jerry Springer show.I'm sorry, but does she think that because she screams and uses dramatic physical gestures that that kind of stuff actually passess for emotion??Also, Melora Walters(as Claudia, a young woman addicted to cocaine), gave a patchy performance.While she was better than Moore, I also got a little annoyed with all her screaming.When will some of these actors learn that you can't just scream in a movie and expect emotion to transcend the screen.I'm sorry, but that kind of cheap approach does not pass as true feelin.The rest of the performances were solid enough, and would've been fine, if there hadn't been such downers from the aformentioned actors. I mean it just pained me to see some actors give heart and soul, whose performances had me admiring their craft every step of the way, while some actors had me wondering how the director stood there and allowed that kind of \\"acting\\" to be filmed.<br />That is the main problem with the film.The second problem with the film is that there was too much screaming, too much excessive drama.Paul Thomas Anderson is immensely talented, but he needs to learn about subtlety, and that its not neccesary to have every single moment of the film be a dramatic revelation/realization/confrontation.<br />All in all, I like watching this movie, but I find that it could've reached its potential had it not been so overwrought and overly dramatic, and imbalanced by devastatingly great performnaces, and cringe-worthy bad ones.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok, I'm not going to deny it, I'm a huge DMB fan. So, it was almost a big &quot;duh&quot; to everyone I knew when I confessed I was really digging John Mayer's music. &quot;Of course you like John Mayer,&quot; they said... &quot;He's a Dave Matthews ripoff.&quot;<BR>But is that true? I have to admit, there are distinct similarities in the sound, but by far John Mayer has managed to carve his own niche in this style/genre of music. His music isn't a hybrid or clone, but still is something that DMB fans such as myself can enjoy in its own right frm a truly talented songwriter and musician.<BR>Room For Squares is an incredible offering at that. From &quot;No Such Thing&quot; to &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, &quot;City Love&quot; to &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot;, and, of course, &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;, I continue to play this CD over and over, along with his other disc &quot;Heavier Things&quot;.... and sometimes John's on my playlist even when Dave isn't. :-) I truly think John has his own style to appreciate and hope others give him a listen before writing him off. <BR>This is no wanna be, folks. John Mayer is John Mayer, and he's an awesome musician.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|Kate Beckinsale was great, action from beginning to ending of the movie.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Every so once in awhile a band will release an album that you can never forget and you will always remember forever.  I have been an Opeth fan since Blackwater Park and was ever so shocked to hear them do an ablum of such emotion, darkness and hope at the same time without the screams and grawls which has it's place and time.  It took me awhile to adjust to the mellow and yet dark theme of this album and once I did I could not stop playing it over and over again.  It's too bad the music scene in the states is so pathetic and it's not about talent anymore but rather the $dollar sign$.   I am so thank for the Sweedish and the talent that continues to come out of Sweeden.  Buy this album not because of the other Opeth albums that are Death/Black metal but rather for the mellow, dark, and emotion behind it.  Listen and let your many emotions flow.  I hope they do another album like it.
B00005JMCT|4.0|Since 1999, we've all gotten a chance to know and love the \\"American Pie\\" gang, with all their true to life gaffes and foibles and the genuine goodness of their efforts.  Now, four years after the `fab four' from East Great Falls cemented their pact to lose their virginities by prom night, one of their number, Jim (who also did unspeakable things to apple pie in that first film), is getting married to his infamous `band camp' girlfriend, Michelle (Alyson Hanningan).  After two films of watching poor Jim (Jason Biggs) have every bad thing possible happen to him in his quest to gain sexual experience, it's nice to finally have Jim get it right and make the big trip down the aisle (though, the path there is no less hilarious).<BR><BR>\\"American Wedding\\" brings about half of the original cast back for one last go as Jim and Michelle take the final plunge.  It's good to see Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and, yes, even Stiffler (Sean William Scott), again.  Though, the absence of the others ranges from understandable to downright mystifying.  Kevin's ex-girlfriend, Vicki (formerly played by Tara Reid), really would have no place in this movie.  They broke up at the end of the first film and made peace with their respective directions in life at the end of the second.  So, her absence makes sense; as does the lack of the famous foreign exchange student, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth); although we do miss her.  The glaring omissions from this film are supercouple Oz and Heather (played by Chris Klein and Mena Suvari).  Their relationship was still going strong at the end of \\"American Pie 2\\" and they both were still integral parts of this group of friends.  One can only surmise that Klein and Suvari both felt that a third film was beneath them.  Hopefully, there's a better explanation than this because that would be disappointing.  <BR><BR>Issues with the casting aside, \\"American Wedding\\" still manages to embrace the heart of this series while losing verylittle of the humor.  At the very beginning of the movie, when Jim is preparing to propose to Michelle in a romantic restaurant, they end up in the kind of compromising situation that could only happen to Jim.  Once they are engaged, the challenge becomes planning the perfect wedding, Jim learning how to dance, and Jim meeting and trying to win the approval of Michelle's parents (played by Deborah Rush and the always amusing Fred Willard).  Separately, these are very daunting tasks. Together, they are even more taxing.  When you add the unwelcome presence of Steve Stiffler forcefully inviting himself to the wedding, it has reached a critical mass where nothing but bad things can happen.  Of course, this is Jim's wedding, so things will definitely go wrong.  He can't seem to do anything right to impressing Michelle's parents; he is having a difficult time getting Michelle her dream wedding dress; and, now that Stiffler has wormed his way into the wedding by promising to give Jim the dance lessons he needs, Jim has to keep the `Stiff-meister' reigned in.  Suffice to say, as things get more out of control, the movie gets funnier and funnier.  There is even a scene where Stiffler gets his comeuppance by having a markedly worse experience with a `brownie' than Jim had with a pie.  I believe that when all three movies are looked at, one will see that Stiffler has ended up having bad experiences with every conceivable bodily excretion.  <BR><BR>Stiffler was a totally obnoxious bore in the first two films and, if he had continued to be one here, \\"American Wedding\\" would have bombed.  Fortunately, Sean William Scott does a marvelous job at playing Stiffler as an obnoxious oaf who still has a heart.  Stiffler wants to right and be a better person, he just can't seem to get out of his own cocky way.  His maturity over the course of the film is one of its shining aspects.  He never loses that `Stiff-meister' quality, but he manages to balance with a little more heart.  The roles of Kevin and Finch are essentially window dressing in this film, brought back so that Jim could have his buddies to share in his experience.  However, there is a funny subplot where Finch and Stiffler compete for the affections of Michelle's sister, Cadence (January Jones).  Of course, no \\"American Pie\\" film would be complete without Jim's dad (the winning Eugene Levy) providing his `unique' brand of advice to help Jim through one of the biggest moments of his life.  <BR><br />\\"American Wedding\\" brings the `saga' of the \\"American Pie\\" guys full circle and provides a satisfying conclusion to their stories.  Seeing Jim and Michelle on their wedding day makes you feel good for them as you know they will have a sparkling (and very wild) future together.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys new album is off the chain! I can't stop listening to it, it's distracting me. haha The best song is the title track Diary. Timbaland produced Heartburn, but if you never looked at the credits you wouldn't be able to tell. Kanye West produced You Don't Know My Name. When You Really Love Someone reminds me of A Woman's Worth. I don't feel like I know any more about Alicia, but that's her business. I got what I intended to get and that was good quality music.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|this is the definition of uplifting! it's music to warm your soul and is the first true advance in music for years. we've been wallowing in silly electronic pop for so long without noticing that the world's languages, cultures and politics are all mixing up more and more. what was needed was someone to sum that up in a joyful uplifting album, that doesn't ignore the seriousness of what's going on around the globe (so the wonderful love song me gustas tu is followed shortly afterwards by denia and its look at algeria's woes). manu chao not only does all this but spoils us with his multilinguism and his playful use of sound bites and backup musicians, while each song flows into the next like a radio show. there's so much to listen to, think about and move to that your mind and body come alive. can't wait for his next.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|This was the first CD I ever bought, before I really got into rock. I didn't really appreciate it until after I bought some more hard rock and heavy metal CDs, but once I did...all I can say is, whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer, this album will shake you up. Personally, I think \\"Calm Like A Bomb,\\" \\"Mic Check,\\" and \\"Born of a Broken Man\\" are the best tracks on the album, although there is not a single song on here worth skipping. \\"Calm Like a Bomb\\" kicks off with an awesome bass solo that leads into a great fist-pumping rocker. \\"Mic Check\\" (and Rage in general) has some of the most impressive guitar-vocal coupling since the early Grunge era. \\"Born of a Broken Man\\" starts out with a very poetic almost ballad-like verse, then screams out with a heavy chorus (backed, of course, by Tom Morello's unmistakable guitar drive). The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that it lacks variety. Some of the later songs tend to run together a bit. (For a lot of people though, that's a good thing...)
B00005JLEU|1.0|I'd just as soon have given this no stars at all!  I read all the great reviews and I was SO looking forward to watching this DVD but, oh my, even making allowances for cultural differences, this was a total drag.  I found many of the characters irritating, the plot (?was there a plot) went every which way, and I didn't think the animation was so very spectacular.  (No I wasn't expecting Disney or even Don Bluth - but I thought it would be better that it was somehow.)  Well.... you can't please everybody.  I'm just not that hard to entertain as a rule.  (Please know that the last movie I absolutely hated was in 1971!!!)  I'm glad that so many people seem to have gleaned so much pleasure from this flick.  I'm only sorry I wansn't one of them!
6305399212|5.0|No matter how many times you see ALIENS, you can never really appreciate James Cameron's thrille, which is certainly the best of the Aliens trilogy and one hell of a movie in its own right.  This time around, just catch the nuances of Sigourney Weaver's Oscar-nominated performance as Ellen Ripley.  Weaver shares her fear, her anger, her helplessness, her love for Newt, her unflinching courage in facing the queen Alien!  It's a performance you don't usually find in a sci-fi film.  Weaver is magnificent!  Catch Michael Biehn's low-key performance as the kind marine, Hicks.  Biehn who starred in the first TERMINATOR plays his role with quiet strength and he elicits the few smiles Ripley manages.  And of course the horrifying beauty of Stan Winston's aliens, probably the most frightening &quot;creature&quot; ever committed to celluloid.  Considering this movie was done before the advent of CGI, the special effects are awesome, and Cameron's tense pacing brilliant.<br />A True classic!
630157401X|5.0|By far, \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" is my favorite film of the trilogy.  This movie is just absolutely enjoyable to watch from start to finish.  Indy is back chasing a religious artifact that a widespread audience can appreciate, battling the Nazis across the skies and desert, and the woman is not the annoying, scream fest of \\"The Temple of Doom.\\"  In particular, I enjoyed two aspects of this film. First, it provides an explanation for many aspects of Indiana Jones's character.  For example, we receive background information of Indy's youth, providing an explanation for why he chose the field of archaeology to begin with.  Why does Indiana Jones have Harrison Ford's famous chin scar?  Why is he named \\"Indiana?\\"  Where did he get his hat and bullwhip?  All of these questions are answered and fleshed out in this film.  Secondly, and more importantly, I enjoyed seeing the interaction between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.  It was very nice to see the father/son relationship and development throughout the movie.  In the first two movies, Indy's character is rather flat and uninteresting.  In \\"Last Crusade,\\" however, we finally get to see his character come alive and develop.<br />On top of all the action in this film, the music score is fantastic and really adds depth to the film.  The comedy in this film is also immense; \\"Last Crusade\\" definitely has a lot of fun.  The scene in which Indiana fends off the Nazis on a motorbike, while his father does nothing but frown is classic and cannot be missed.  If you haven't seen this film, just go see it.  It's that simple.

0553208845|4.0|I have not slept craving companionship or security from an inanimate object for years. The stuffed teddy bear of my childhood has long since been thrown away and I don't recall ever owning a blanky, &agrave; la Linus Van Pelt. I grew out of these sorts of things long ago. However, after unintentionally falling asleep while slowly reading Siddhartha in the dim light of my bed lamp, I woke to find myself clinging tightly to the book, as a child does a safety blanket. I admit that a paperback could hardly be considered soft or cuddly, but take my word on it, Siddhartha warms your heart all the same.<br />Here is a timeless story of self discovery told in a manner which is at once both simple and profound. Presented as the tale of a young boy experiencing the various trials and splendors of life while exploring eastern philosophy and learning about himself, the novel is actually a very easy read with everything presented in a straight forward fashion. Despite this, I continually found myself re-reading the same paragraphs and passages over and over again while slowing my pace to take everything in more gradually. As I did so, I wondered silently to myself what I was attempting to accomplish. Was I trying to find some hidden meaning amid the subtle words and simplistic messages? Could it be that I was merely attempting to absorb every drop of beauty and depth that I possibly could from the story and its plot? Is the answer both? Is it personal and dependant on myself (or my 'self')...?<br />This is one of the magical things which Siddhartha does, it makes you think. Repeatedly, the story of Siddhartha and his evolving perspective makes you ponder deeply about concepts which are, on the surface, very simple, but which all of us have made complex. Then all at once the book makes even the complexity beautiful... and for fleeting moments scatterred throughout the story everything becomes perfect, till as all things do, the moment passes and fades, so that you may read on.<br />Siddhartha is the first novel from this author that I have read. Hesse came to me highly recommended by many people and this book did not let me down in the slightest. On the contrary, I am rushing off to the bookstore now to search for more material that I might hope to delve a little deeper.dhartha is the first novel from this author that I have read.

B00009TB5G|5.0|For fans of the books, this extended edition is the definitive version of the film, and well worth the 4 hours it takes to get through it.  The 43 minutes of extra footage is relevant and, often times, critical to the telling of the story-- especially in terms of explaining the departures Peter Jackson made from the books with the character of Faramir.  <br />The cast commentary is good-- if it was possible to remove Sean Astin's film-school-freshman-pseudo-philosophical cranked up rambling, the cast commentary would be excellent.  Billy Boyd and Dom Monaghan had me rolling with laughter during the commentary, bringing of fond memories of Mystery Science Theater... which more than made up for Astin.  I'd give a small fortune to see a Dom-and-Billy-only commentary on these films.  These guys are really, really funny.<br />The Director's commentary and the 2 disks of additional &quot;making of&quot; features are A+, and have provided hours of entertainment.  Without a doubt, these films have redefined what is possible in terms of film making-- made all the more apparent when the viewer is shown the level of detail the film makers went to in the making.  I am a fan of the books who is also, now, a fan of the films.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have absolutely no regrets purchasing this cd.  In fact, even better is the Limited Edition where you get two extra songs and a DVD (the making of this cd).  One of the extra songs is &quot;She's out of my life&quot; previously sung by Michael Jackson.  Josh sings this song so much better and with so much soul.  &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; is another fantastic song.  All in all, Josh has not disappointed his fans again.  This is one fantastic cd and it is so worth the buy!
B0000C1733|2.0|How in the world can you make a greatest hits and not include your greatest hits??? WHere is KNOCK ME DOWN, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, THE ZEPHRSONG, DONT STOP?????  THis Greatest hits has songs on the cd such as UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING that wasn't even released as a single... OTHer than that the songs are great and the new single fortune's faded is classic peppers... BUT if you are really picky about your greatest hits and already have blood,sugar,sex,magic and californication then dont waste your money..
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|If you're looking for a profoundly moving deeply written and produced album, then pick up your bags and take a hike. That's not what this album is and it's not what it's trying to be. It is, however, a great rock album to throw on in the car shower or anywhere and with it's catchy lyrics and melodies you can't go wrong. I love this album for what it is and if you like that then buy this puppy.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I love this CD. It is true some tracks sound a little familiar to her other album. But there are also some differences. I love the way she touched new beats. Her lyrics, for me are sweet and close to the heart. I also enjoyed the DVD. I had seen Ms. Keys a few months ago here in PR, she is aways a breath of fresh air.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|This presentation is very basic and simple as the advertising stated.  It is what you would hear from a live stage performance in a small club.  It is sort of like the difference between the acoustic Dylan and the electric Dylan.  Whether you think this version is better depends on your taste in musical styles.
B0000CDL93|5.0|No matter which side of the fence you're on regarding the JFK assassination, Oliver Stone's JFK is a provocative and frightening film which, as critic David Denby said, \\"would scare God.\\" Critics have said that the film ought to be dismissed because it manipulates facts and history. Well, okay, but the same could be said about TORA! TORA! TORA!, THE LONGEST DAY, and PATTON, but the critics were strangely silent about the liberties those filmmakers took with history. And although there is no mistaking what Stone thinks happened on 11/22/63, Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, repeats countless times, \\"Let us speculate...\\", \\"We can assume...\\", \\"What if...\\". This is a movie about speculating, and about the frightful implications of the possible results.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, most of the casting and the performances are perfect. For my money, though, nothing beats British-born Gary Oldman's convincing portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald. I was stunned by his brilliance. Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Cissy Spacek, and the dozens of other cameos were equally beyond amazing (although, at times, Joe Pesci sounded more like he was from New Jersey than New Orleans). In this edition of the film are scenes that were edited out from the version released in theatres, and you'll easily understand why. They aren't bad scenes at all (the scene of John LaRoquette and Mort Sahl as thinly disguised Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon is very good) but they don't add much to the story. The accompanying documentary \\"Beyond JFK\\" is interesting but flat when compared with Stone's film. Still it's worth a view.<br /><br />The real stars of this show, however, are Oliver Stone's meticulous direction, Robert Richardson's eerie and engaging cinematography (for which he won an Oscar), and the frenetic editing job by Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia (also Oscar winners). This team flawlessly paces this three-hour film: rushing it up at the dramatic moments, cooling it down when the audience needs to digest the data. Like Scorsese's RAGING BULL, the filmmakers employ several types of cameras and films, moving from dolly shots to hand-held, color to black-and-white, grainy to clean. The effect is a dazzling and haunting recreation of what may have happened in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 and what that day did to those, like Jim Garrison, who attempted to find the truth.
0780021967|2.0|Alfred Hitchcock's British film making period hints at the brilliant foray of creative genius that was to follow during his Hollywood tenure. In &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; Hitch' perfectly captures the aura of swinging London and its music halls - except that this time they have become the scenes for murder, mayhem and, one of Hitchcock's classic touches, the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. Robert Donat stars as that wrong man, playing out a series of parts as Richard Hannay, Mr. Hammond, Capt. Frazer and Henry Hopkins. A Canadian tourist, Hannay is forced to flee police across the countryside and Scottish moors after he is suspected as part of a deadly conspiracy that resulted in the murder of a mysterious spy in his London flat. Hannay is accompanied, for the most part, by the abstinent Pamela (Madeleine Carroll). Determined to prove his own innocence and find the criminal mastermind with the missing fingers, Hannay eventually winds up in a showdown and a race against time. Hitchcock populates his landscape with a series of eccentrics, villains and downright kooks in an effortless blend or romance and adventure. <br />?The 39 Steps? is made available in a slew of bootlegged DVD transfers ? none of which are satisfactory, including the legitimate and expensive Criterion Edition. Granted &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; was a film in genuinely bad shape, before Criterion came along. But this DVD is not &quot;pristine&quot; or &quot;sparkling&quot; as Criterion?s packaging suggests. Contrast levels are still too low. There's an incredible amount of camera flicker in almost all of the scenes. Fine details are lost in darker scenes and only marginally visible during the brighter ones. There's also a limited amount of edge enhancement and shimmering of fine detail. This is not an outstanding restoration or even a mediocre one. When I think of &quot;pristine&quot; and &quot;sparkling&quot; Warner Brothers' &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; comes to mind. &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; is no Millie!!!<BR>Extras include the usual fluff stuff - a bunch of written essays that are really, really boring. Honestly, how many DVD?s have you read lately?!? A documentary on Hitchcock's British period is also included but is not comprehensive and appears as though the source material being used were found under a hay stack in Sussex. And this is what Criterion wants consumers to pay upwards of $40-$60 bucks for? FORGET IT!
B00005JM02|5.0|To tell the truth, I've been meaning to see &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; since it came out, but just never got around to doing it. So last Saturday, I caved in, took a trip to Blockbuster's and watched it. I don't regret a second of it.<br />My friend Robert was initially reluctant to go see this movie because he believed it would be a &quot;silly children's movie.&quot; Naturally, I argued with him. Several months after this, he came up to me one day and admitted that he'd just seen &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and had been totally wrong about it. He absolutely loved it. Actually, I think it would be hard not to.<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is simply the best animated movie I've seen in a very long time (probably since &quot;The Lion King&quot;). From the very menu screen on (just trust me), it's wonderful. It's simply hilarious and it's very, very cute. It starts out with a beginning worthy of &quot;Bambi&quot; and proceeds to tell the tale of a father and his son, two clownfish who live on the reef. It's very rare to see such an endearing father-son film as this one - &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is terrifically special in that sense.<br />The story itself involves Marlin (Nemo's dad) trying to find his lost son and Nemo himself trying to escape from the aquarium he has been trapped in. In his journey, Marlin encounters Dory, who is personally my favorite character in the film. Dory has some problems with her short term memory. Ellen DeGeneres does a beautiful, funny job as Dory's voice. My very favorite scene is about two seconds long, but I'd watch the whole movie just for it: it involves Dory's &quot;squishy&quot; (a little jellyfish), but beyond that, you'll just have to see it for yourself. Yes, it's really that good!<br />The story and characters are certainly memorable in themselves. Yet, the visual imagery in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is simply breathtaking. It looks *real*, truly underwater, right down to the shafts of sunlight and the rippling pattern of the lighton the reef. The DVD even has an &quot;aquarium&quot; feature so you can just relax and stare at scenes from the reef. I really don't know how to describe with it, but my response was sheer amazement. I didn't know we could do stuff like that!<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; has definitely worked its way into being one of my favorite movies. I bet in ten or twenty years from now it will be as much a classic as &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; are now.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|This maybe one of those cd's that will be great after a couple of times of playing it. But right now it's just ok. It's a well to do album, but it doesn't come close to her first cd. If you are comparing it to the other choices out there right now, it is excellent.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This is clearly the best comic book book movie of all time (well I have to put it up there with Spiderman because that was also a classic) and the way the director introduced nightcrawler was truly astonishing.  I can't wait for the next X and the introduction of phoenix.  Thank you for the X series because the Matrix 2 and 3 was a total disappoinment. Everyone pick up this dvd its the best buy by far.<BR>SimmSation<BR>scannon@sprintpcs.com

B000066NW0|5.0|This is an amazing CD,filled with the true version of what really occurs within the brain of a teenage girl. From the moment 'Losing Grip' begins to the last moments of 'Naked', the listener is captured within the powerful grasp of the music and strong, female voice which tells of events from the eyes of a seventeen-year-old girl who truly loves what she does.
B0000648WZ|3.0|Something must have happened to the film between the editing room and the theaters.  I watched the DVD with commentary as was fairly well stunned to hear that this was some sort of anti-fascist film.  Sure, you can draw parallels loosely in the uniforms worn or the way the society is structured, but c'mon Paul, you failed miserably if we're supposed to leave the theater thinking about the evils of war, class differences etc.<br />It was a fun, mindless action film that you can sit down and watch for a little fun.  Try to tell me there's deep anti or pro this or that messages underneath it all and you're just saying that to think you're smarter than the next guy.  What exactly is evil after all?  You have to serve your society in order to earn full citizenship.  Well maybe not in the military, but would it be so bad for every 18 year old to take a year and do some volunteer work?  I just completely miss how this film supposedly makes some case against facism.  The soldiers completed their task, doogie howser was friendly with them at the end and they'd go on protecting themselves from an alien threat.  Fascism sounds good to me if that's what it's about (I know it isn't okay?).  Socialism, now THERE is true evil! :-)
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is the BEST CD I've bought this year!!   I hope this gets more airplay than around where I live.  I LOVE all of the songs!  I give all the songs a 10/10!!!  I hope there's more where these came from! LOL!    *~*Laters!*~*
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This film is a fine sequel, and lays obvious foundations for future X-men films.  Wolverine is back at the epicenter of what has become nearly all-out war between mutants and normals, a struggle that sorely tests the resolve of the titular heroes to remain conciliatory towards humanity.  Much of the tension in the film comes in odd and almost touching places.. while there are many of the requisite fights and displays of super powers (all of which are handled expertly), the real traction comes from the interplay between the characters.  From one brother calling the cops on his mutant sibling to the devout prayers of a mutant with more than a passing resemblance to a devil, to the interaction of a father with his mutant son, the real interplay of mutants with humanity is addressed with determination.<br />The plot itself is on par with the earlier film and is just plausible enough to hold interest, although it does slip a bit too easily into the 'entire world at stake' mode that eventually doomed other series such as Superman.  Nonetheless those that enjoyed the first film will relish the expansion of familiar characters as well as the addition of new ones.  I think the best compliment that can be paid to these films so far is that not only are they good superhero films, they are good films period.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends, though not as experiemental as later RH works, remains the best album of the 90s. There's plenty of angst...\\"I wish it was the 60s, I wish we could be happy, I wish that something would happen\\", there's great guitar work, there's somber moments (Bulletproof, with beautiful acoustic and falsetto) and it all melds together beautifully.<br />Perhaps the most undercredited aspect of The Bends is the production work of John Leckie, who's worked with many groundbreaking bands over the past 30 years, including Floyd, the individual Beatles, the Posies, Human League, Stone Roses, the Verve, Robin Hitchcock, Kula Shaker, XTC - even Wizzard's \\"See My Baby Jive\\".  <br />Most interestingly - and perhaps parallel to RH - was Leckie's work transitioning the critically acclaimed but publically overlooked BeBop Deluxe from a guitar band to an 'art band' and to a punk band (Red Noise) within the span of four albums in the 70s.  You can tell from Pablo Honey that Radiohead had some potential, but needed a lot of finetuning to get over the hump.  <br />It will be very interesting several years from now, if RH releases outtakes from this session, so we can compare the different takes with what Leckie ended up releasing and truly appreciate the leap the band made from Pablo Honey to The Bends.<br />It may not quite be the Revolver of its decade, but it was certainly better than Nevermind.
B0000028WD|4.0|&quot;Archie M&quot; seems to have rather missed the point of this album, when he complains that many of the song versions here &quot;have no resemblence to the original&quot;. That's the WHOLE IDEA OF INTERPRETATIONS! He seems to like McGuinn's &quot;Tambourine Man&quot; because it sounds just like the record. What's the point of that? <br />Sure, nobody is going to like *everything* here (I could do without Mellencamp for example), but there are a few absolute stormers - Lou Reed, Richie Havens, Tracy Chapman, and - especially - Eric Clapton. I'd go so far as to say that EC's performance of &quot;Don't Think Twice&quot; is not only the high point of this show, it's the high point of his *career*. If you're a fan of the &quot;Layla&quot; album, and have been disappointed with the mostly soporific stuff he's done since then, listen to this - it's *blistering* - right up there with &quot;Have You Ever Loved A Woman&quot;. Great, great music.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Two pages ago someone actually called the Beatles &quot;the NSync of the 60s&quot;.  Someone else noted that the only reason Zep, Floyd, et.al. were famous was because &quot;there wasn't much rock in the 60s&quot;. This is the price of free speech...<br />As number 1200-whatever, I may be the oldest (47) reviewer of OKC.  I did buy it on original release. I rounded up to 5 stars but believe Bends was the better 'album'. There is nothing unlistenable on Bends, while OKC has &quot;Fitter Better&quot; and more weaker moments in general.  Of course, I might also be the only one who skips over the first 8 cuts to Electioneering - my favorite on the CD.  <br />I am having a difficult time believing they routinely include &quot;Creep&quot; on their set list, but only &quot;Airbag&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot; from OKC and generally only &quot;Green Plastic Trees&quot; from Bends... it's tough for old guys like me to sit through live Kid A and Amenesiac when they're perfectly capable of rocking the house.
B00008438V|2.0|first let me start by saying, i own this movie.  i hadn't seen it in years.  YEARS.  but i remembered it being so funny when i was younger.  so i went and bought it.  i must be getting older, though, because this movie is just not as great as i remembered.  although, one of my favorite lines of all time is, &quot;i don't know what the hell you're talking about and i wish you'd shut up.&quot;  now that is classic.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|If you think Brittney Spears CD is better than Alicia Keys you must be on some strong drugs!!   It's nonsense.    Brittney CAN NOT SING!!!!!!!!!!!

I thought singers are supposed to sing.<br />Anyway buy Alicia's CD, I promise you will not be disappointed!
0385504209|4.0|My wife read this book first and enjoyed its mysteries, revelations and pacing, but was uncomforable with its portrayal of Christianity. I share her feelings, but we both agree the novel is worthwhile as a guilty pleasure. The book is cleverly and expertly done. The use of real historical organizations, such as the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, and Knights Templar give it a serious, true-life sense. The fact that larger-than-life historical figures like da Vinci were involved with -- and even led -- The Priory of Sion gives it wonder. And author Dan Brown has cooked up a clever premise in which the foundation of Christianity would be shaken if the \\"truth\\" were known. And so the chase is on, with a symbologist, a cryptologist, and eventually a Royal historian solving riddles and rhymes in their search for the Holy Grail, with the French and eventually English authorities nipping at their heels as they are blamed for an increasing number of murders.<br />But what starts out as a fascinating cerebral adventure with a near literary tone can't quite hold that highminded course. What commences as wine and filet mignon dwindles to cola and hamburger. Maybe that's what happens when you cross the channel. The richest parts of the book come when we are in the head of the protagonist, Robert Langdon -- especially at the beginning, when he sees a historical, even ancient, symbolism in practically every object that meets his eye. These roots of our now familiar symbols are fascinating. But when the chase is on and ongoing puzzles need to be solved, they become tedious and even simplistic. The \\"difficult\\" clue concerning Sir Isacc Newton and an orb? Duh! And the \\"unseen\\" bad guy was all too obvious. Plus, I don't really think the French and English police are as dumb, naive and comical as this book would lead you to believe. However, when Ron Howard and his \\"Brilliant Mind\\" team produce the movie, as I've read they will do, I'm sure a lot of these discrepancies will be ironed out. Hopefully, the movie will hold to that rich Mona Lisa atmosphere the book so promisingly begins with. I have faith.<br />As for the attack on Christianity, when He was arrested Jesus told Peter to put up his sword. Because, if He needed to, He'd bring down legions of angels to kick butts. That's good enough for me. Meanwhile, everyone should enjoy The Da Vinci Code and take it for what it is -- a work of fiction built from elastic facts, like looking at clouds and seeing myriads of differing visions. Anyway, Langdon's true insights on symbols are worth the price of admission.pefully, the movie will hold to that rich Mona Lisa atmosphere the book so promisingly begins with.

B0000TB03W|5.0|What could be better than rushing downstairs on Xmas morning and unwrapping your very own copy of Shania Twain's Up Live in Chicago DVD?  This is the best gift anyone could hope to receive.  So for those of you who have a Shania fan to shop for, don't disappoint, get them this DVD.
B000063K2W|5.0|Mary Haines believes she has the perfect life with a wonderful husband and loving daughter.  Perfect, that is, until she hears the idle gossip from the woman at the spa about how Mr. Haines has taken up with Crystal Allen, a shopgirl who sells perfume.  Listening to her friends Sylvia Fowler, Edith Potter, and Peggy Day, Mary does all she can to win back her husband from the scheming arms of Crystal.<br />This Geroge Cukor film has one of the sharpest scripts written for the screen, and features many of the Golden Era's best actresses: Norma Shearer as Mary Haines; Joan Crawford as the conniving shopgirl Crystal; Joan Fontaine as the innocent Peggy Day; and in one of the best performances, Rosalind Russell as the fast-talking Syliva Folwer.  Her rapid-fire delivery of some of the most sarcastic lines is amazing to watch, and she gives the character much comic flair.  Marjorie Main pops in for a while as Lucy, who runs a ranch in Reno for women going through divorces.  In a short but fantastic scene, Virginia Grey plays Pat, another shopgirl working with Crystal who can't help but try to unnerve Crystal while she's on the phone with Mr. Haines.  Even columnist Hedda Hopper makes a brief appearance toward the end of the film.<br />Two other remarkable notes about this film:  of the 135-member cast, there is not one man present in the film.  And two: the film is black and white, with the exception of a fashion show sequence toward the middle of the film which is shown in glorious technicolor.  It's a bit lengthy but marvelous to look at all those fashions designed by Adrian (who has quite a long list of memorable films to his design credits).<br />The DVD is a restored version of the film.  (The difference can be seen in the alternate version of the fshion show sequence included as a bonus.)  Also, there are two short films: one about the romance of the cinemal the other about using the movies to influence the fashion trends around the world.  Wonderful bits of movie history.  This is a great film, full of smart dialogue and great acting.  A true cinema classic.istory.  This is a great film, full of smart dialogue and great acting.  A true cinema classic.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Afterglow is a collection of soothing melodies with often anguished, tense lyrics.  No, this isn't the CD full of hits some have been waiting for but I'm fine with that.  It's good music -- even if most selections aren't made for radio.<br />I have two beefs:  First, the CD is only 40 minutes.  That's 20-30 minutes less music than law-abiding consumers are accustomed to paying full price for.  Not that quantity is more important than quality; I'll take a few great tunes over a library of bad ones in a heartbeat, but I have to believe that Sarah McLachlan is talented enough to be more prolific than this over the five years since Surfacing.<br />And second, what's this \\"Bandlink\\" music-player nonsense? Caveat emptor: if you buy the cd and, like me, are a Windows Media Player user (and I assume the same goes for RealPlayer and other popular media players) you can forget about playing the music on your computer using the media player of your choice.  No, when you put the cd in your computer's cd or dvd drive, it forces you to install a dedicated (and extremely mediocre) media player from \\"Bandlink.\\"  So, even if you are a law-abiding music listener who paid retail, not only can you not make a single legal copy of Afterglow for your computer, media center or portable device, you can't even listen to it on the media player of your choice.<br />I'm all for protecting intellectual property.  But I do believe that the packaging should warn the prospective buyer of this limitation.  I might have purchased and downloaded a protected digital version of Afterglow so I could listen to it on my computer using the player of my choice, which is how I listen to most of my music.  With the cd, I'm forced to tote the music between work and home and use a third-rate media player.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|This is by far the best album I've purchased in the last ten years. It's a breath of fresh air to hear REAL instruments, REAL vocallists, NO profanity, and to hear an album that sounds great from track one to the end. Simply Red has brought back a sound that has been missing in popular music for a couple of years. You Make Me Feel Brand New is a beautiful remake of the original. Sunrise is also excellent. Lost Weekend has a nice laid back groove to it. One of my favorite tunes on the album is &quot;It's You&quot;. Has a very nice vintage touch to it, and it always puts me in a good mood when I listen to it. I'd give it 100 stars if I could.
B0000AWEL8|5.0|There is no track called \\"Kling Klang\\" The extra track is a quicktime video of \\"Tour De France 03 Version 2\\". Amazon retains CDNow's bad habit of getting the track listing wrong.  The video is great, but I can't understand why the domestic release did not include it. I hate having to buy an album more than once!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a big fan of science fiction.  Have been as long as I can remember.  As has my wife.  I can safely say without hesitation that Farscape and Firefly are two of the finest shows to grace our screens.  <br />Some folks may be uncomfortable with the idea of mixing a western with a space faring show.  (Not to disregard the point that the original Star Trek was marketed as Wagon Train in space.)  But within that context the show was superb.  I hope that with enough attention, Fox may reconsider picking the show up again.  Or perhaps another network will get wise to it.<br />The writing, directing, special effects, sound, and especially acting in this show were of the utmost caliber.  The characters all had charisma and, most importantly, chemistry.  It was a joy to watch.<br />My wife hasn't let me delete the episodes off of Tivo until the DVDs came out.  I would have paid much more for this collection.  Hopefully with this low a price, more people will pick it up and experience this fantastic show.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Being 40 something and really not into newer artists / music, I was very pleasantly surprised when I recieved this CD as a gift. This young woman has a passion in her singing matched only by the Diva's of old. I would love to see this young artist record a tribute album of Janis Joplin songs...Pink has that rough, throaty vocal style similar to Janis' trademark voice. The lyrics on this CD are honest and the music is catchy and varied. Outside of two uses of the \\"F\\" word and one use of the \\"S\\" word...the explicit lyrics warning really would most aptly apply to the hidden track, \\"Hooker\\" which is not included in the clean version. If your youngster is looking for Santa to drop this CD in the stocking this season...the clean version is just fine. Adults and older teens, I don't think would find the regular version any more offensive than anything they would hear outside of a bubble. Although this artist is popular with a younger crowd...the depths of her lyrics are way too real for someone only 24 years old. If you like Janis Joplin, Joan Jett, Etta James and the like...you might want to give this gal a listen. If she stays true to her talent instead of pandering to the pop culture...she'll be around for a long time. There's a lot of great oldies looking for a voice like hers to resurrect and present them to a newer, younger audience.
6304698798|5.0|On of the most impressive things about &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (&quot;Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo&quot;) is that it is not director Sergio Leone's best film, which would be his next one, 1968's &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (&quot;C'era una volta il West&quot;).  But this 1966 film has is where Leone moves from his first two spaghetti westerns, the Akira Kurosawa inspired &quot;For a Fistful of Dollars&quot; (&quot;Per un pugno di dollari&quot;) and &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (&quot;Per qualche dollaro in pi&ugrave;&quot;), and starts playing on a grander scale.<br />In listening to the commentary on the DVD version of &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; I learned that all of the actors in his films were dubbed because Leone did not bother with sound when he went out to shoot his movies.  If you remember how the invention of sound destroyed the more cinematic aspects of the movies by restricting movement so that actors could be near microphones, then you can appreciate the sense of freedom this gave Leone.  The result is a distinctive style that goes well beyond Leone's signature juxtaposition of wide vistas and extreme close ups (often in a single shot, without a cut).  Leone also likes to take his time, as evidenced by the final three scenes of the film, where Tuco searches for the grave with the gold, the three-way gunfight, and the parting of the two survivors.  His films ran long and were routinely shortened (read: &quot;butchered&quot;) for their American releases.  But even so, there is a clearly boldness and a flavor to Leone's cinematic vision of the west that is as distinct as that of John Ford or any other classic Hollywood director of westerns you want to name.<br />In the final film of Leone's &quot;Man With No Name&quot; triology, Clint Eastwood (now called Blondie instead of Joe and Manco but obvious the &quot;Good&quot; guy) has a new scam going as a bounty hunter who saves his captures from the rope so that the reward goes up and he can move on to the new town and do the same thing all over again.  His pigeon, the &quot;Ugly&quot; Tuco (Eli Wallach), is not exactly happy with the arrangement and finally has the opportunity to reverse their situation.  However the former partners find a new unity of purpose when a dying man tells each of them part of the secret location of $200,000 in captured Union cold.  Our story takes place in the New Mexico territory (that is where the two particular generals mentioned had minor skirmishes during the Civil War), and the Yankees and Rebels are between the two and the gold.  Then, there is the &quot;Bad&quot; Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), called Angel Eyes, who has also been on the trail of the gold.<br />From an acting perspective the most impressive performance is that of Wallach, although this is partly by default.  Tuco never stops talking while Blondie is a man of very few words (but great timing) and Angel Eyes communicates best when he narrows his eyes and glares at people.  In the hands of another actor Tuco might have been more of a buffoon, but Wallach develops one of the most multi-dimension characterizations in the history of Westerns.  In those brief moments when Tuco stops talking you can see his mind turning over what to do next before heading off full throttle in a new direction.<br />&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; does stand on its own, even though it is the final film of a triology.  I originally saw the film in a movie theater and did not see the previous two Leone-Eastwood collaborations until decades later on late night television.  But while the order in watching Leone's films is of little consequence to the appreciation of any particular one of them, at some point you should enjoy going through them in chronological order to see exactly how within a five year period he went from ripping off Kurosawa to creating what remains my favorite western of all time.the reward goes up and he can move on to the new town and do the same thing all over again.

B0000C7GG2|4.0|I of course haven't heard of this album in the States like on radio stations or whatever - but was surprised at how much Matt Bellamy sounds just like Thom Yorke.. which made me pretty happy.  The music is different even though their voices are similar.  <br />If you really know nothing about the band (which I didn't prior to buying this cd) then something decent to go by is this: if you like Thom Yorke's voice (from Radiohead) and the moody tunes that Radiohead puts out... add a little more rock to that and you have Muse.  At least on this cd.  Songs 1-5 on this cd blew my mind, mostly because they're dreamy and intense and make me want to jam out and just sit in a chair and sway.  #6 sounds kind of Beatles inspired and then the rest of the cd has all these string arrangements and more raw guitar progressions.  Really interesting. <br />But if you're not in the mood for the &quot;moodiness&quot; and dreaminess of this album, it's something you almost want to make fun of.  Or how towards the end of the album is gets kind of poppy on track 11.  I think it's lyrically quite good though.  And not a good after-breaking-up cd either... with all this talk of &quot;this is the last time i'll abandon you&quot; &quot;time is running out.. i won't let you smother it&quot;.... etc.  Good album though.. give it a try.
B00003CXXP|4.0|One can see a virtual tug of war between the philosophies of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg play out in this film.  This movie questions some of our basic assumptions such as 1) humans have feelings whereas robots are unable to ever cross that path; 2) that robots can start out being mechanical, unthinking decides and evolve, somehow, to intelligent, reactive life forms; and 3) that when humans are gone, some higher form of robotic life will remain.<br />At the same time, some religious individuals may question how the robots -- the modern form of civilization in the future -- arose?  That is never explained.  Moralists may question what the real message behind the movie is.  Do robots demand our respect?  The movie gives the impression that they do, IF certain conditions are met, such as their exhibiting superior intellectual skills, which is not present at this time.<br />What if the robots in the film are just programmed to be spontaneous and random, to show human emotions, yet do not actually experience them the same way humans do?  Then what?<br />Michael Gordon
B000092ZYX|5.0|I bought this cd the day that it was released, went home and listened to it, and was not dissapointed.  I had heard there there on the radio and was not overly impressed with it, but i found with Hail to the Thief, that the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you.  After hearing it many many many more times there there became a favorite song of mine (also after seeing the video numerous time) along with the songs Wolf at the Door, Stand Up Sit Down, 2+2=5, and the Gloaming.  Those are just some of my favorites though, because the whole CD is outstanding.  I've heard people call this OK computer II, which is remotly true, as it starts up from where OK Computer left off.  Truly a good Radiohead album.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This is a fantastic film with incredible cinematography.  This would be your standard &quot;thriller&quot; with unexpected deaths, destruction of property, and unseen killers enganging in destruction, one by one, of its prey.<br />The location, a motel, in a deserted, rain-drenched location, is fairly creepy.  Fate has had it so that many different individuals, through partially related circumstances, have to spend the night in one creepy motel.  One by one, they start dying, and one by one, the story appears more odd.  Who is doing the killing?  It turns out that the principal suspect--the convicted convict--is not the killer.  I will not spoil the ending, but it does have an incredible twist by presenting a plot that would not be expected.<br />The writers of this screen play thought very deeply about dreams, thoughts, schitophrenia, and multiple personalities.<br />WELL DONE.<br />Michael
B00004Z400|5.0|I picked up this CD having friends tell me that this was a great CD and liking the songs passenger and digital bath.  I listened to the rest of the CD and couldn't believe the number of great songs.  I am not a huge fan of Chino's voice and though i do like it, i get a bit tired of it after a while, but for some reason on white pony i can listen to it over and over again.  With tracks such as Change (in the house of flies), Knife Party, and Back To School, this gets a definate 5 star rating in my books.
0792843835|5.0|This movie is just perfect. It deserves all the oscars in the world. After watching this movie, you feel good about life....
B000024D4R|5.0|I love Pink Floyd, and this has to be my favorite album from them.  With only 3 main songs clocking in at 17, 11 and 10 minutes respectivly, there is still tons of music on this CD, and every minute is excellent.  It's impossible to pick a favorite out of pigs, sheep, and dogs, each having its positive notes.  With each song being so long they are very in depth and a person can get very into each song.  I can throw on this cd press play, and the next minute i know its already over, so i play it again.  Its very relaxing music but provocative with its ideas.  If you liked Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here, don't hesitate to pick up this album, you won't regret it.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Never been so surprised with a movie.  I had zero expectations for it (old Arnie, original cast largely gone, new director, female terminator seemed to be a grasp for something exciting).  But the movie was great.  Very enjoyable action film in which characters change, there's humor, and great thrills.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Awesome. Alien films are one of the most influential and awesome, not only science fiction flims, but in flims in general.  I only wish the Predator had a duel film legacy of its two films as Aliens had with its 4 movies. But we only have the first predator to satisfy our thirsts. The DVD set is just full of goodies any sci fi fan will love.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This is definitely better than SIAM. I've read some of the negative reviews and they're way off. Her voice sounds terrific. If you're really an R&amp;B fan, then you'll like this CD. The album is more mature and showcases her talent more than SIAM did. It just doesn't get much better. This is an impressive second effort. And really, I can't playing this CD!!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Into the West is the PERFECT ending to the trilogy and will set the mood beautifully as they sail &quot;into the west&quot; on the ships. Annie Lennox belts the ballad with emotional strains that will bring tears to your eyes. Don't believe the others that say this song doesn't fit. It is PERFECT for LOTR and a great ending.<br />Howard Shore has done it again - he has outdone it again. This is the best score of the 3 from the LOTR trilogy to a film that will undoubtably be the best film of the 3. The opening music to the movie is PERFECT and will go perfectly with Smeagol/Deagol.<br />Billy Boyd's voice work is breathtaking. Viggo, as always, is excellent with his vocal stylings on &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.<br />And &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot; is awesome.<br />Buy this soundtrack today. Even if you remotely enjoyed the scores to the previous 2 films, this will make you happy.<br />Thanks Howard! This is every film score fan's dream come true!!
0316921173|5.0|some people don't like wallace.  some facts: his vocabulary most likely exceeds our collective vocab.  his tendency to use footnotes probably exceeds our collective tendency in this direction.  his talents as a writer most likely exceed our abilities (as, i might point out, exemplified by this review).  the vocabulary seems to incline some to call dfw pretentious.  the footnotes seem to incline others to call him rediculously academic.  the talent inclines most of us to thoroughly enjoy his work.<br />the parallel stories of the jest are, in and of themselves, interesting to follow.  the happenings at an elite tennis academy on a hill, and the lives in a half-way house at the bottom of said hill.  the way in which these are interspersed is remarkable.  the further inclusion of secret agents and assassins, as you might imagine, makes the book that much better.<br />wallace is quite the nice writer, inasmuch as he is nice to the reader.  there are various &quot;puzzles&quot; that one can play with and try to figure out, but eventually he simply explains what is happening.  thus, for anyone that enjoys joyce's writings but want something a bit more modern, the jest is an excellent choice.  for anyone that likes logic/word games, this is truly a treasure trove.<br />as for range: wallace's telling of a.a. stories can be surrealy depressing, his &quot;recounting&quot; of a game called eschaton (i appologize if i have mispelt that, i don't have the book handy) is disastrously hilarious, and his explanation of the mean-value theorem for integrals is witty and accessible, even for people lacking second semester/real analysis.  if you want it, it's in here.<br />quite frankly, if you're looking for an exceptional literary experience on par with pynchon or delillo but were hoping for a self-contained package, this is it.  the jest is just that and so much more.  besides, how couldn't you love a book with a main character brighter than your average physicist that pulls his friend's frozen-to-the-window head away without running some cool water over the point of contact first?  see?  i can feel your love for the book already.
B00003CXA2|1.0|How do I get a Forrest Gump movie on DVD, without the wide screen format?
0743244249|3.0|cosmopolis is wanting in many ways.  if you have come to appreciate the remarkable humour in an average delillo book, this will, no doubt, disappoint.  certain touches are fantastic: delillo's exploration of the car itself (yes, in some sense, the one on the cover) is quite good, and the way in which the relationship between the protagonist and his wife plays out is also something to hold on to, but otherwise the book was, for me, non-engaging.  the alternate naratives were, i thought, poorly executed and served little purpose in the end.  one would have expected a brilliantly sharp moment of insight, an epiphany of sorts, yet instead the story ends up (essentially) fizzeling (fizzing?  fizzle-ing? fizzling?) out with the end result nearly forcing the query: where's the ingenuity?<br />instead try on underworld, white noise, ratner's star, or mao II.  they all do an excellent job of showcasing delillo's writing style and his true talent, talent you might not notice if you restrict yourself to cosmopolis.
B000002LAB|3.0|The best song on this album is the title song, Tutu.  This album was published in the 1980s, which should tell you that the music is going to have a 1980s sound.  What kind of sound is that?  Well, except for the grandmaster's trumpet playing, the accompanying music sounds very synthethized.  Synthesizers were popular in 1980s music, so that's how 99% of this album sounds, save Tutu.  It just doesn't have that cool jazz sound that we are used to hearing from Miles.  I highly recommend Kind of Blue instead of this album.
0385474547|3.0|If I was looking for a book to read and saw this one I probably would not have picked it up to read. I was assigned Things Fall Apart as a reading assignment in my English/Social Studies class. In the begining of Things Fall Apart it starts off slow and talks about culture and nothing really happens. It also talks about the main characters. Towards the end of Things Fall Apart most interesting aspects of the story start to happen. Though I would have not chosen Things Fall Apart to read, it ended up being educational and interesting. You learn about African Culture and certain ways of living. How you work, what you eat, and even what you belive. I would definitly recomend Things Fall Apart to anyone that is interested in learning about a different culture than their own.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|The film \\"About a boy\\" is basing on the novel \\"About a boy\\", written by Nick Hornby, and takes place in the modern England.<br />The 12-years-old boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) lives with his mother Fiona (Toni Collette) in London and he has a life full of problems with his mother, his schoolmates, the first love, etc. And one day he met the 36-years-old Will (Hugh Grant). Will doesn't have a job and earns his money with the copyright of a Christmas song, his father had written, but he's exactly the one who Marcus needs to become more like a teenager than an adult. In the film begins now a special relationship between these two different characters and they become more and more friends. <br />The directors Chris and Paul Weitz developed a amusing story with a few melodramatic and portrays their characters very good. Furthermore they don't repeat the whole book and the \\"boring\\" scenes are cut out. The actors are chosen very well. Hugh Grant plays his typical role of a British guy with his own mistakes and the young Nicholas Hoult is support him perfectly. The choice of the other actors is well chosen too because they are performing the characters of the book great.<br />In conclusion I can say that \\"About a boy\\" is an entertaining movie for the whole family, with some critical statements against ignoring teenagers and force them to do things they don't want to do.
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci Code is a mystery/suspense/thriller that seems to have been deemed \\"intellectual.\\"  While it is the former, it is not the latter and it ultimately fails to be much more than an intriguing idea.  Still, like most books of this genre, it is an entertaining, easy to read page turner.<br />This is the story of Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor, and Sophie Neveu, agent of the French version of the FBI, as they seek to explain the murder of Neveu's grandfather and discover the secrets that he protected.  The mystery revolves around the history of Christianity, secret organizations and complex riddles.<br />Although the idea behind the story is fascinating, there is not much to the book other than watching the characters gradually solve the mystery by solving a series of riddles.  While the riddles they solve are interesting, it quickly begins to feel like you are watching some one do a crossword puzzle - you, the reader, are stumped by the clues, impressed by the solutions, but eventually bored as the characters fret over finding the answer before shouting, \\"I've got it!\\" over and over again.<br />There are other faults too.  The protagonists are pursued throughout by police and enemies, but the police are more like Keystone Kops and the enemies too vague in purpose to be necessary.  In fact without either there really is no conflict in the plot at all and it really is just two people trying to solve a riddle.<br />The strength of the book is the underlying premise - that there is more to the story of the history of Christianity than we know.  However, even in this there are problems: once the subject of the mystery is revealed, the rest of the book no longer matters.  Also, Brown mixes actual history with his own fiction. By not telling us where the dividing line is, we are robbed of learning any new, interesting historical theories.  Certainly, much of intriguing history described is true, but which parts?  Without knowing you have to dismiss most of it as fiction.<br />If you are interested in this genre, there are better books: Up Country, by Nelson DeMille, is a very good mystery being solved by a man and a woman thrown together in a foreign country, or some of David Morrell's books (Brotherhood of the Rose or Fraternity of the Stone) for religious thrillers.  If you do decide to read this, borrow it or wait for paperback.s fiction.<br />If you are interested in this genre, there are better books: Up Country, by Nelson DeMille, is a very good mystery being solved by a man and a woman thrown together in a foreign country, or some of David Morrell's books (Brotherhood of the Rose or Fraternity of the Stone) for religious thrillers.

0140386335|1.0|I read the first half of this book in under a week.  I continued to read and found the same events to be occuring over and over.  This book is horribly repetative and boring.  The writing is atrocious.  Do not read this book!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is simply amazing. I will admit that it took me some time to get into. I found &quot;The Bends&quot; to be more accessible, so I kind of disregarded &quot;OK Computer&quot; as inferior, but I was very wrong. Both albums are simply amazing, and Radiohead is my favorite contemporary band. Bar none. Throw all the Coldplays, White Stripes, Oasis, etc. stuff at me...I really don't care. Those are exceptional groups as well (at least the first two), but Radiohead is beyond exceptional. I can not describe how brilliant this band is. THIS is creating music. This is like what the Beatles were doing back in the 60s with stuff like &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; and that &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; stuff...even things like &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; and &quot;I'm so Tired&quot;...I just get flashbacks to the greatness of the Great Band when I listen to Radiohead. It could be the beauty of the music, but I also have to put, on an equal par, the beauty of Thom Yorke's voice- which has to be an instrument directly from heaven.<br /> Anyway, the songs on this album are really magnificent. They gell together so well, obviously, this beinga concept album. My favorite song is probably &quot;Exit Music (From a Film).&quot; Very dark and depressing, but the lyrics are so moving. I absolutely love &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; as well. The music and the chorus is haunting.  &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; is another favorite. I think the words gravitate towards a reflection of the times in which this album was created. In fact, this whole album is a statement of the 90s generation- the reliance on technology to replace practically everything: the way you think, the way you feel, the actions you take, etc. This is a very deep band.<br />  Really, all the songs on here are perfect. In the context of this album, everything fits. &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; HAS to be there, becuse it is sort of the apex of where the whole thing is going to end up. I must mention again that Thom Yorke has one of the most haunting, breathtaking voices I have ever heard. Ever. I really, really recommend this album. i can go back to it every time with wide-eyed wonder at how incredible this band is. Every single time.going to end up.

B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar's newest film is nothing short of excellence.  Ironically, I would not consider myself in the main age group at all.  I'm sixteen, and to make matters stranger, a guy. (A straight guy for you skeptical bastards out there)  Anyhow, even someone such as myself can appreciate the superior animation and the simply unbelievable cast of characters.  This movie has a little something for everyone.  <br />Let's begin with the plot.  At first, it's nothing special.  Marlin and Coral, two clownfish, find a new home on the reef and prepare for their eggs to hatch.  However, a barracuda attack leaves Coral and almost all the eggs dead.  Only one sole egg escapes, and Marlin names it Nemo since his wife had that particular name in mind prior to her death.  Relax, you don't actually see anything violent.  Marlin is simply knocked unconscious in the skirmish and awakes to find Coral and the eggs gone. <br />In the future, Nemo wants to attend school, and MArlin has become rather over protective of him.  He reluctantly lets Nemo go, only to chase after him when he learns his teacher, a clever manta ray, is taking the kids to a dropoff point where the ocean stretches and gets deeper.  He eventually catches up to his own and is infuriated even though Nemo had not yet done anything wrong.  Out of frustration, Nemo takes on the challenge of his peers and swims out to a nearby boat to prove to his father he is not so helpless.  Then a returning scuba diver appears and captures him.  The remainder of the story is all about Marlin's frantic and desperate search to find his only son.  Along the way, he encounters sharks, sea turtles, pelicans, and many more unique characters.  There are also some other scenes involving Nemo's adventures in the fish tank.  The story is a basic scenario where one character takes it upon himself to resolve a situation against all odds.<br />The characters are the highlight of the film.  There has to be at least one character anyone can relate to in thiscast.  The voice acting is certainly superior, and the emotion cannot be denied.  It is extremely impressive to believe that such feeling could be generated by characters with no arms or legs.  It is almost all in the voice and facial expression.  Although some characters are certainly more liked than others, the variety makes every turn a new experience.  <br />The final aspect that I enjoyed about this film were the simple hidden messages.  One particular insightful quote was Gill's, &quot;Never stopped me.  Now, just focus on what you have to do.&quot;  Intriguing; a fish explaining the most basic way to overcome any obstacle.  Although annoying, there is also Dory's true mtto, &quot;Just keep swimming.&quot;  Isn't that the truth?  No matter what life throws at you, you've gotta find a way to get through it.  The movie is loaded with hidden meanings and profound lessons.  <br />To conclude briefly, Finding Nemo is not a movie designed for my viewing audience, and it is impossible for me to say there aren't moments when that problem arises.  However, it is equally impossible for me to say I wasn't entertained throughout the movie.  I recommend Finding Nemo to all ages.  It is surely at least worth one view.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard him on the WB's new show One Tree Hill, and that's why I went out and bought the cd. I wouldn't recommend ordering it online though because its like 4 dollars less at Best Buy and there's no shipping to wait for.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show, cast and crew deserved so much better than FOX. What really struck me about this show was that it had no growing pains. Most shows take a while for the actors to find and grow into their characters but the cast of this show immediately fell into their roles. That only happens rarely and only when the casting and stories are of the highest calibre.<br />It always amazes me that FOX comes up with absolute gems of shows and then throws them away to churn out yet another boring, unimaginative reality TV show. Whoever is responsible for picking the shows at FOX needs to be fired because they clearly don't understand what has lasting power. No one will buy a DVD set of any of the rubbish reality shows they create (over... and over... and over again) but this DVD box set has already shot into 12th place on the first day.<br />Then again, perhaps I give FOX too much credit... they've made these kinds of idiotic decisions in the past (anyone remember SAAB?).<br />BUY THIS DVD SET - you'll be treating yourself to a show unlike any other - it's got everything in one box; sci-fi, western, drama, humour.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Being a huge Radiohead fan, I pretty much follow them blindly.  Even their bad songs are 90 percent better than the majority of today's music.  However, as the title alludes to, this album has a political tone to it and is very disconcerting.  Being a political conservative, I have a problem with some of the overtly political songs like &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;2+2=5&quot;.  There are some beautiful songs here, like &quot;There, There&quot;, &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Myxamatosis&quot;, but they don't compensate for the band's political views.  I just wish music and politics would stay separate, like the church and state.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Personally, I don't care if people think Radiohead are too popular or are overrated.  I am glad they are successful because they get the financial backing to make brilliant records like Hail To The Thief.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is a great spin off the old Arthurean legend.  Even through a womens point of view, the story takes you 3 generations and how Arthur came to the throne and how he was removed.  The main conflict was not of the battles between the saxons and the britons but of the &quot;Old Religon&quot; and the rise of Christianity.  Although the novel is 876 pages long many readers can tackle the book in a few days to a few weeks depending on how much time you dedicate to the book.  Overall the Novel is outstanding in the retelling of the Legend that is long since due of a revision.
0679720200|1.0|::yawn:: Here is your plot. The main character doesn't care about anything, about himself the world or other people. And in the end and instead of defending himself (and he is 100% innocent) he chooses to die instead. Wow what a real hero, a true life that we should all imitate. I'll put it in simple words, IT'S STUPID. Don't buy this piece of junk, I had to read it for High School and I think it's garbage. The main character is simply, a moron. Wow how philsophical and interesting. Not to mention it's translated poorly from the French language.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Anyone who has heard this cd and comments that it is not just as wonderful as Sarah's last cd, must not know what beautiful and moving music is. In comparison to &quot;Surfacing&quot;, Sarah creates the same feeling of frusteration, and yet, can still acheive the calm afterward. With her amazing voice and vivid lyrics, this cd is sure to be one that will rise to the top of the charts.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|A Merry Whitney Christmas<BR> <BR>Let me start off by saying, nothing is wrong with change. Everyone is commenting on the fact she sounds so different, but her voice is like fine wine. as years go on she is only going to get better, that is strenght you are hearing in voice. Her personal life has nothing do with her talent. we all know she is talented, Whitney Houston is nasty! people can say what they want, there is no one that can come out and say they can sing anything better then whitney. she has made these Christmas Carol's her own. just like everything she has ever sung. when you buy this album, you would see it was worth it. Get it, love it and stop judging people for the inperfection. o holy night is off the hook..Go get &quot;One Wish&quot;, and if you don't have &quot;Just Whitney&quot; grab that too. you will have a Merry Christmas, with Whitney on track.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|First of all. Anyone complaining that there is no such word as &quot;Quadriology&quot; should just shut-up. Anyone ever hear of the phrase &quot;creative license&quot;? Movies and books are always coming up with new words or mis-spelling them on purpose (Pet Semetary, anyone?).<br />This is by far the best boxed set I've seen. And well worth the money ($74.95 at Target). Anyone who is not a &quot;collector&quot; and just a casual fan might baulk at the size, scope and price of this fantastic set, but if you're truly a fan, display this one proudly.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|1.) The First Noel- What can I say this is Whitney Houston first track listening on her amazing album \\"One Wish\\"...The arrangements her voice is just great on this song!

B0000BWVCM|5.0|After futile attempts such as Spawn and Batman and Robin years back, I felt comic book movies shouldn't even bother.  They have appeared on the big screen with little or no success.  The idea of an X-Men appearance would have been ruinous.  However, such grave thinking is history.  After the blockbuster entry of Spider-Man and the first X-Men film, comic books voyaging onto the theaters are no longer a laughing matter.  X2 is a true achievement which implies that in the long run, comic book films are here to stay.<br />Let me get this out of the way and say it, X2 is the best comic book adaptation.  Unlike several movies that fit in the Sci-Fi category, such as the Matrix, X2 can stand on its two feet without bombarding the audience with an excess of computer animation or action sequences that easily become  monotonous or tiring.  Right at the beginning, we are introduced to a mysterious character, Nightcrawler, and the action isn't dreadfully lengthy nor does it impede the plotline.  Its to the point and it enhances the story in everyway.  Some bullet time is thrown in but its done tactfully.  Since the first X-Men movie explained the essence of the characters, X2 makes for a smoother and gratifying movie.<br />What makes the movie so great, despite the considerable cast, are the characters themselves.  The focal plotline gets the job done in the Hollywood aspect, but the characters brought to life from the pages of the comic books is an utter spectacle.  We don't think the mutants are totally fictitious as a parent might from glimpsing at a comic book cover.  The execution, human performance, and the action drive the story without slowing down.  From Rouge's inability to make the affectionate moves on Iceman,  to Wolverine's shady past, the movie has so much story clocked in so little time.  Although, knowing a little history behind the X-Men can really suspend you in anticipation with the hints of Jean Grey altering into the Phoenix.  Surely, this paves the way for a rewarding setup in the next installment.  Comic book enthusiasts should be proud, and those unfamiliar to the X-Men universe really get an abundance of something refreshingly new.<br />I'm sick of the comic, novel, and videogame zealots wailing that the original medium had this and that, and the film itself failed to explain this or showcase that.  I once fit those nonsensical shoes, as I age I begin to understand.  What I have learned from the Lord of the Kings and other comic book adaptations, is that their original mediums can't possibly be covered in a two-hour movie.  To extract every detail form the pages of the Uncanny X-Men is unworkable, if not ludicrous.  Besides, who really desires to see a movie if they know how its going to end?  Do you really want to see how character X transforms into what he is, when you know all the details already?  Adaptations to films, in my view, are about seeing the characters in action and being defined by real, human performance.<br />As a DVD, X2 is bundled with a ton of extras, but the movie itself warrants a recommended purchase alone.  One of the best movies of this year, X2 heightens the wait for other comic book tie-ins such as Spider-Man's sequel, the upcoming Batman, and the Fantastic Four.  There is a new genre in movies and this time it ain't no joke.way for a rewarding setup in the next installment.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; album is without a doubt the best holiday album out. All the songs get you in the christmas mood. &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; is one of my personal favorites. Whitney does a amazing job with her vocals were great! (A+) For &quot;One Wish&quot; The Holiday album...Next time Whitney add &quot;Jingle Bell&quot;.
B000127LW2|1.0|I would seriously stay away from this show if I were you.  It started out promising, but the writers just didn't know how to take it to the next level, and so it stayed just a mediocre show.  I have to admit, I just stopped watching around 4th season or so, it just got so boring...and I'm a complete Trek fan, I grew up on Star Trek, but Voyager just bored me to tears.  I would still catch it every now and then, if I just happened to be flipping through channels and there was nothing better on, but I wouldn't make it a point to watch every single episode like I did with TNG or DS9.  But anyways, that's my opinion, is that it is not worth your money.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Her holiday album is here. Whitney comes back to her choir girl roots, and the result is pleasing. Not unbelievably good, but very good. She may have been through a lot personally, but her voice sounds rich and strong. <br />The song featuring her daughter is a special gift and mothers will find it touching.<br />It is a traditional album which would be good for playing during tree-decorating, cookie-baking days. Also nice for the car ride at night to look at lights. A little less of a party background CD, because people would listen to the CD instead of talk. Overall, enjoyable Christmas music from a Whitney we have missed. She can still sing. Welcome back.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I bought her 1st album after the hoopla and the grammy...I bought this one last week to see if the &quot;sophmore jinx&quot; was in effect. I previewed it at a local music store last Tuesday when it was released; after hearing the 1st 8 cuts, I was sold. This is a GREAT work compared to everything else that is out today. I listen to ALL types of music; Alicia's diary is an oasis in the desert of all of today's offerings. This is music you can just PLAY around the house...it's a 'chillin' groove; you can be working, making love, reading, on the phone, WHATEVER...this is some MUSIC FOR ALL OCASSIONS! If I was uncertain before, I'm sold on her now...DIARY (track 7) is probably the best cut, but the whole thing is RIGHTEOUS...what's the area code, girl???

1573225517|5.0|Hornby is so readable. Also plenty of music in jokes for people born in the 50s or 60s. I relate to the anatomy of a dying relationship - the ugly mess that you may have decided to break up, but there are still all these ties. And even though you don't want to get back together, this pathetic part of you wants them to feel like it's still costing them something not to be with you.<br /> <br />There's also the thing about the loss of magic once you move in with someone: before every meeting was an exciting assignation - now they're just there because they're not somewhere else. Indeed, somewhere else is where there's some preparations made. It still seems a shame that nakedness can become so casual and non-sexual, but to make a big deal of it would be too inconvenient and after a while, farcical.<br /> <br />The central character's deep closing insight (although there are insights right along the journey. Hornby comes across as someone able to be honest with himself, even some ugly bits, but he still basically likes himself, so it doesn't turn into a jaded piece) is talking about the long-term partner he's finally decided he wants to marry:<br />\\"I know what's wrong with Laura. What's wrong with Laura is I'll never see her for the first or second or third time again. I'll never spend two or three days in a sweat trying to remember what she looks like, never again will I get to a pub half an hour early to meet her, staring at the same article in a magazine and looking at my watch every thirty seconds, never again will thinking about her set something off in me like `Let's get it on' sets something off in me.\\"<br /> <br />Yet novelty is so pathetic compared to commitment - as Hornby continues:<br />\\"And sure, I love her and like her and have good conversations, nice sex and intense rows with her, and she looks after me and worries about me ...., but what does that all count for, when someone with bare arms, a nice smile and a pair of Doc Martins comes into the shop and says she wants to interview me? Nothing, that's what, but maybe it should count for a bit more.\\"<br /> <br /> In How Far Can You Go, David Lodge goes further by describing a guy who's been married for twenty years acting on an infatuation with a secretary. Far from the usual Hollywood `a love too deep to be denied, a forbidden love' as being grand and passionate, Lodge shows how stupidly out of sync the indiscretion is with the whole rest of his life - he hasn't begun to think about the implications, of what this could cost him, and how little in effect it's really offering. Likewise the girl doesn't really know what to do with him now.<br /> <br />Earlier in the book Laura remonstrates with Rob (1st person narrator) about how, of course, in trying to always keep doors open he's actually closing at least as many more.<br /> <br />There's some other interesting stuff touching on class, and even more basic proofs that just because someone doesn't know the difference between Miles Davis and Acker Bilk (an example from my own experience, not Hornby's) they still may be worth talking to. Some people (especially in this society that lets you string out your teenage lifestyle and, in some cases, ignorance, well into your thirties) may spend decades in a proudly pretentious sub-culture, foolishly only allowing friendships with a the few who share their prejudices.<br />And, dammit, it is a very satisfying book. With his wit, honesty and readability Hornby could, like so many others, have got by without much of a plot. But plotwise this book hinges on a funeral, which, true to life, comes out of the blue. We're just cruising along in this generally feel good novel (although it does touch on some ugly stuff, and in his `four awful things I've done' slap you right in the face), and experiencing most of the big emotional things in past tense detachment. Plotwise we may vaguely expect Rob to come to terms with Laura's departure and to maybe hook up with someone else. Then Laura's dad dies, somehow we get this full on climactic scene where Rob's at the funeral, and Laura ends up saying to him, \\"I'm too tired not to go out with you.\\" Later she explains:<br />\\"I thought that we were bound by one simple little cord, our relationship, and if I cut it, then that would be that. So I cut it, but that wasn't that. There wasn't just one cord, but hundreds, thousands, everywhere I turned ... and then on the day of the funeral, it was me that wanted you to be there, not my mum. I mean, she was quite pleased, I think, but it never occurred to me to ask Ray, and that's when I felt tired. I wasn't prepared to do all that work. It wasn't worth it, just to be shot of you.\\"<br /> <br />Hornby managed to throw this into a really powerful context.<br /> <br />The sub-plot about Rob taking up DJing again is a bit cheesy, but everyone wants a happy ending.<br /> <br />Strewth, quite a diarising type review - but that's one of the things I enjoy about Hornby - he relates to me. Whereas when I leant a About a Boy to nearing retirement A.  (who's given me Stone Diaries and The Idea of Perfection), she couldn't relate - much as I couldn't to these undeniably well written books. Maybe it's a generational thing: not just the pop-culture references, but the whole `vibe', man, that two similarly aged people may unconsciously share.omehow we get this full on climactic scene where Rob's at the funeral, and Laura ends up saying to him, \\"I'm too tired not to go out with you.\\" Later she explains: <BR>\\"I thought that we were bound by one simple little cord, our relationship, and if I cut it, then that would be that.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|The final track on this album, entitled 'Into the West,' is one of the most moving songs I have ever encountered. Perhaps I might be a little biased because the references to the Grey Havens were among my favorite parts of the book. Like many others, I equate the Grey Havens to Heaven or some sort of Otherworldly existence that lies beyond what we know in this life. I never cry during songs unless they have strong sentimental value connected to a family member and/or loved one, but this last song broke this mold. When you think of Annie Lennox singing lyrics about the &quot;ones that came before&quot; and the heroes traveling &quot;out of space and time,&quot; you'll realize what I'm talking about.
B00008K9Z5|5.0|Simpley put, Meteora is a great CD and is worth buying. This CD, is more metal then Hybird Theory, but still not as good as Hybird Theory. Heres how I rated the tracks<BR>Foreward- Its not a song, just a lead to the next track<BR>Don't Stay-9/10-Its a great song but the courus sorta gets anoying<BR>Somewhere I Belong-10/10-The first single is great. <BR>Lying From You-9/10- The yelling part is great and so is the hip-hop part but the courus isn't that great.<BR>Hit The Floor-7/10- Its gets annoying real quick(the courus does)<BR>Easier Tor Run-10/10- Great Song, Should be next single.<BR>Faint-10/10- Best Song On CD.<BR>Figure 0.9-10/10- I Never get tired of it. This or Easier To Run should be next single.<BR>Breaking The Habbit-6/10- Too slow for me. Not enough noise.<BR>From The Inside-10/10- Courus is great, Yelling part is great, the song is great.<BR>Nobody's Listening-9/10-The song is great, it just could have used a bit more noise.<BR>Session-8/10- No singing, A good spot for Mr. Hanh to show off his skill and Rob to do some good drumming.<BR>Numb-10/10- This and faint are the best songs on the CD

B0000CAQ27|2.0|I don't need to type a 1,000-word review to describe this so-called album. I've never liked P!nk's voice. She just shouldn't have ever been a singer at all! Whoever made her a singer or hired her should be fired from his or her job. Of all of the P!nk songs I heard, I only liked &quot;There you go,&quot; and &quot;You make me sick&quot;... and those are from the first album! I listened to this CD @ the leak @ mtv.com and I hated it. It's just a waste of money. Buy Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper instead.
6305079811|5.0|To be honest, I hedge at telling friends I actually like this movie sometimes. However, I just cannot hide my fancy for this totally fun loving movie.<BR>If you are a total fussbudget about special effects, you will not appreciate the creativity involved in the old school (non computer generated)type special effects in this movie.<BR>It will never be an Oscar winner in any sense of the word. But it brings it's own sense of yesteryear serial that is just too much fun. It's actually silly in some instances. I truly think that sense of not taking itself so seriously is one of the most hypnotic wonders of this movie. It will actually draw you in and capture your imagination.<BR>I would love to see a special edition that would have some interviews with Flash, Ming, Voltan, Baron, Dale and especially Princess Aura. <BR>Long live Flash..!
B000002UJQ|5.0|It is very difficult for me to articulate what an amazing album this is. It has this amazing capacity to sweep the listener into another world of ranging emotions from being rocked so hard by musical superiority and versatility (Paranoid Android) to the sensation of levatating on open air(Exit Music for a Film). Absolutely a fantastic album that I wish I had come across much sooner. BUY! BUY! BUY!
B000002UAU|4.0|I suppose Rolling Stone can't admit that Sgt. Pepper is less than stellar some 35 years after its debut (after all, the magazine is as old as the album), but when I saw it listed as the BEST album of all time, I couldn't take it anymore. Truth be told, I wonder who in the hell keeps perpetuating this myth that Sgt. Pepper is the Beatles' best. I could easily think of albums much better, either by the Beatles themselves (Revolver, Abbey Road, and the White Album, in that order) or others (Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot;, Joy Division's &quot;Closer&quot;, etc). Face the facts, folks: Sgt. Pepper is a product of its time, and one that hasn't hold out well. Granted, there are psychedelic relics that hold up less well than Pepper, but none of them have ever been mistaken for &quot;the BEST album ever&quot;. I have each of the Beatles' albums, I am not one of these &quot;Beatles #1&quot; fans (owning only a copy of the &quot;best of&quot; that came out a few years ago, to line Messers. McCartney and Jackson's pockets), I know what I'm talking about when I say that (while this is a good album in its own right) it's not the BEST album ever.<br />I must confess, I got this album free on CD after having it on tape for years beforehand, so I can't complain about &quot;wasting my money&quot; even if I hated it (see my &quot;Let it Be...Naked&quot; review). But as good as this album is (and I can't stress this enough) it is not the BEST album ever...that honor belongs to Revolver. Rolling Stone needs to pull their heads out of their collective asses and admit as much.
B00005JM02|4.0|I was expecting more from this movie after hearing such wonderful things about it. Toy Story this is not. It is a beautiful movie with a good story though. Most of the jokes fall flat. I chuckled a few times. No laugh out loud moments. Ellen's part saves the movie from being completely boring. I'd rather see a movie based on her character alone. I liked Finding Nemo but it made me sleepy.
0446677450|4.0|This is a book that makes you think about how you have wasted your money on simple things like having credit cards and things that only put you in debt. Advice that your parents have told you over and over again may not be the best advice to give. Having good grades and continuing school may help you but if you don't have the financial skills to manage your money then you will be working for the money instead of making the money work for you. I enjoyed this book because it makes you think in your future and what advice to give to my daughter when she grows up.
B000065V41|5.0|A few years ago I forced my family to watch this movie.  They all thought I was out of my mind, and being ridiculous, ...none of us were under 30 years old!  Everyone enjoyed it so much and laughed so hard, they all thanked me for making them sit in front of the TV to see it.  The Rat is hysterical, and Michael Caine is wonderful amongst the muppet cast.  Highly recommended!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Please do not listen to half of the reviews you see posted here. This is an excellent album that keeps your attention. The first album for the most part put me to sleep. Not to knock that album, but those who have a wide musical taste would definetly enjoy this album. To sum it up, it's better than the first album..anyone who disagrees apparently got caught up in the hype of her first effort.
B00004W510|5.0|&quot;The Brown Album&quot; is no &quot;Music From Big Pink.&quot; But then again, &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; is no Brown Album. The Band followed their brilliant, acclaimed debut without missing a beat in the heart of their flowing creativity. The sound of &quot;Big Pink&quot; had been so unique that it was impossible to attach it to a specific era, while &quot;The Brown Album&quot; is a distinct musical vision of an electrified &quot;old days&quot; matched with an acoustic backwoods accent. Each of the original twelve songs on the album seem as if they originated from an innocent jam session from the 1800's era Appalachian Mountains, and whisked away into a modern studio in 1969.<br />&quot;The Brown Album&quot; was officially titled simply &quot;The Band&quot; (like the Beatles' &quot;White Album&quot; is also called &quot;The Beatles&quot; and Metallica's &quot;Black Album&quot; is also called &quot;Metallica&quot;; but neither of those albums deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as this accomplishment). From the moment they cross the Great Divide, The Band harps from their own land of Americana, but the feelings they proclaim on the album are still applicable to the times, as genuine as a bottle of moonshine that could have been brewed in 1969 or 1869. Rick Danko's fiddle on 'Rag Mama Rag' sounds as if he travelled back in time with a tape recorder, while Levon Helm's distinctly Southern voice punctuates this song and several others. 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down' is an emotion-stirring portrait from the Civil War, while the &quot;drunkard's dream&quot; 'Up On Cripple Creek' portrays a funky Delta epoch, with Garth Hudson taking a turn at the clavinette, with brilliantly quirky results. Richard Manuel meanwhile gives a typically astounding vocal on 'King Harvest,' a character study of determination and hardship, capped off by a sonic &quot;minimalism&quot; guitar solo from Robbie Robertson. It's nothing short of amazing that a group could make such a solid, believable statement during the swinging 60s with songs like 'Jemima Surrender,' 'Whispering Pines,' or 'Rockin' Chair.'<br />Aside from becoming one of The Band's most acclaimed pieces of work, &quot;The Brown Album&quot; also proved the group was strong and creative even without former employer Bob Dylan in front of them (though &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; had already done much to prove that fact). No other band in history has painted such a stirring vision of the past to contradict an overbearing modern grain.such a solid, believable statement during the swinging 60s with songs like 'Jemima Surrender,' 'Whispering Pines,' or 'Rockin' Chair.' <BR>Aside from becoming one of The Band's most acclaimed pieces of work, &quot;The Brown Album&quot; also proved the group was strong and creative even without former employer Bob Dylan in front of them (though &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; had already done much to prove that fact).

B00005JLK1|4.0|I was actually surprised at this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented it but I was pleasantly surprised.  The actors are well known and the special effects are really good.  A little gory, but well shot.  The ending really surprised me, but I liked the journey.  This movie is well worth the money if you like a good mystery.
B0000TB05A|5.0|I've been to a U2 show.  It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  U2 are easily the best live band in existance today and also probably one of the best live bands in history.  The Boston DVD was great, but the band didn't seem at ease during that show.  In this show, the band looks like it's having delerious fun from Bono's first howls at the beginning of Elevation all the way to the last Hallelujah and last chord of Walk On.  Also, on this DVD you get several songs(New Year's Day, Out Of Control, Angel Of Harlem, Staring At The Sun, All I Want Is You, One, Mysterious Ways) that weren't on the Boston DVD.  And as an added bonus, you get to see Bono's most-adorable-kid-in-the-world daughter dance during Mysterious Ways.  Bottom line, if you're a U2 fan, you can't go witout this.  This is a great band in a great mood playing great performances of great songs, in their element, to a great crowd.  You can't go wrong.  Please get this.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I think Amazon need to change their rating system to include a &quot;Diamond 5 Star&quot; rating because the regular 5 Star is simply NOT enough for this DVD Experience.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Regardless of whether you're liberal or conservative, just don't pay attention to the band's overtly liberal points of view that are in some of the songs as well as the album title.  If you can separate the music from the lyrics and and appreciate the music without they lyrics, using the lyrics as merely a medium with which to enhance the music, this is a great album.  Radiohead is one of the best bands of the last ten years, and if you listen to loud thrashers like  '2+2=5', 'There There', hauntingly beautiful ballads like 'I Will' or 'Scatterbrain', or experimental songs somewhere between RH-eccentro-rock-style and RH-ballad-style, like 'Backdrifts', 'Where I End You Begin', and 'Punchup At A Wedding' you'll know why.  A combination of the other-worldly guitar-rock of 'The Bends' and 'Ok Computer' and the acutely experimental work of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac', this is yet another great offering from Radiohead.  Best heard through a good pair of stereo headphones(as is most music).  I have a vivid memory of listening to it like that aboard a transatlantic flight I was on, while everybody else was sleeping.  That was an amazing experience.  Please don't put it down just because of the political views it represents.
0140277447|4.0|I was suprised to see the number of reviewers who slighted the history of this book--once again, many people would rather ignore real history and take a glamorized fairy tale view instead.  Chang has done a marvelous job in bringing the atrocities of the Sino-Japanese war to light.  As hard as this book is to read, it is good history which does not try to erase the ugly past of our world, but challenges us to become better.  Until the people of the world begin to face up to atrocities of the past, we will not be able to move forward and create a lasting peace. I applaud Ms. Chang for doing her part to put accuracy first, no matter how ugly the truth is.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer really is a pheonominal album.  In a time when Nsync and Briteny Spears dominate the airwaves, and when for rock music the airwaves are much dominated by the crap known as nu-metal or unoriginal and uninspired bands like Creed or Nickelback, this album stands out as a work of art, REAL rock music, the way it should be.  The only bands capable of putting out an album of this qualtiy that are still together other than Radiohead are Coldplay, perhaps Tori Amos, and the one and only, the legendary, U2.  To listen to this album on a discman through stereo headphones, in bed, on a night when a storm had knocked all the power out, was a surreal experience.  Equally surreal was listening to it on a discman through stereo headphones aboard a 747 crossing the Atlantic in the middle of the night.   It really is a great album.<br />But for these RH-Heads, that want to delude themselves into believeing that this is the best album of all time, that just isn't so.  Think about it.  That would be saying that Beatles albums such as Revolver, Sgt Pepper's Lonley Hearts Club Band, The White Album, and Abbey Road, albums that literally changed rock music forever, are below Radiohead's magnum opus.  It would be aside such albums as War, The Joshua Tree, or Achtung Baby of Irish Legends U2.  For those ignorant enough to say there wasn't much rock back in the 60s or that the Beatles were the nsync of the 60s, the Beatles were around in a time when Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Pink Floyd, The Beach Boys, some of THE greatest rock bands of all time, and they still were almost unanimously considered the best.  That dispells both inane comments right there.  The Beatles changed not only rock music, but pop culture, forever, period, end of story.  And that was in compition with other legends of the rock world.  Ok, rant over.<br />The point is, you just can't put OKC, however pheonominal it is, above previous works.  You just can't.<br />OKC still gets five stars though.

B000069AUI|5.0|Radiohead and Coldplay are two different bands.  Get that through your heads.  Radiohead makes dark, looming, intimidating music.  Not that that's bad, hey, I love Radiohead, they're one of the best bands of the last ten years.  But so are Coldplay.  Coldplay, however, makes less-intimidating, slightly more radio-friendly music.  Just because they sound a *little* similar does not mean that they have anything to do with each other.  Rush of Blood To The Head is a GREAT album.  Politik is imo its best track, followed by The Scientist, the title track, and Amsterdam.  In My Place and God Put A Smile Upon Your Face are great as well imo.  These are great pop songs.  They all have very much a feeling of euphoria to them.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album, along with Parachutes and the new live CD/DVD combo.  <br />P.S.Chris Martin is a lucky man, he's married Gweneth Paltrow.
B00003CX7L|1.0|I bought this movie for my kids last Christmas and now look whats happening? Well let me tell you the story, when i first got this for my two boys, they watched it atleast 2 times a day. Soon, they started believing that toys are really alive. Now, they try to talk to theyre toys, and when the toys dont say anything back, they try to kill them! I have found about 6 toys, totally ripped apart in their rooms, and they are still watching the movie 2 times a day! Its been a year, and theyre at it again! So i suggest, DONT BUY THIS for your kids!

0156027321|5.0|I'll admit it: I normally avoid the highly-touted, Sunday suplement reviewed, novels of &quot;literature.&quot; I happened across a radio interview with Author Yann Martel as he answered questions about LIFE OF PI, became intriqued, and decided to read it.<br />I was quite pleased. Okay, more than pleased. This is one of those books that is so well crafted, so intricately plotted, so challenging in it's theme and tone, that by the time you're done reading it, all you can say is, &quot;Wow!&quot;<br />Early in the book, the main character claims that this story will prove the existence of God... I don't know about that, but it's a story that accomplishes what great art of any type does: it sneeks up on you with its beauty and form, and then it gets you thinking.<br />A true masterpiece, LIFE OF PI will stir up your mind and never let you forget that you read it.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Many have already written glowing reviews of this DVD, and rightfully so - it is truly a captivating concert, captured beautifully on film.  (It sounds incredible as well.)  All the musicians and performers are in top form (save Tom Petty, whose voice seems unusually whiny even for him and who looks like the Scarecrow from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; with bleached blond hair), and seem to genuinely be enjoying both the experience and the music of George Harrison.  The two comments I would like to add are that it's nice to see Jeff Lynne featured so prominently, as it seems he gets little respect as a performer despite the great music he's made both with ELO and with others, and that I think it's sad that so many reviewers seem determined to assault Paul McCartney.  Whatever Paul might have said to Eric Clapton that was edited out is inconsequential - he was probably just attempting to be humorous, and I would imagine wasn't meant to be insulting.  (Even rock icons can get it wrong occasionally - that doesn't make them mean-spirited or vindictive, just human.)  It just seems that so many people enjoy bashing McCartney, and, while his boundless energy and constant rah-rah kind of behavior can be grating at times, he truly seemed touched and honored to be part of the show.  Certainly, his performances of &quot;For You Blue&quot;, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, and &quot;Something&quot; are among the highlights of the concert - and, for those who want to call his late arrival onstage as &quot;grandstanding&quot;, remember that Ringo had appeared only two songs earlier.  In any case, the way they both participated was perfectly suited to the occasion - since I'd imagine George wouldn't have wanted his tribute to be primarily about the two surviving Beatles being onstage together again.<br />Just buy the bloody thing.
B000035Z3K|4.0|An Englishman named Renfield travels to the remote castle of Count Dracula in Transylvania to secure the Count's signature on the lease of an Abbey in London. Shortly after Count Dracula installs himself in the Abbey, London experiences a rash of mysterious deaths due to exsanguination. Meanwhile, Renfield has returned from his trip in a state of seeming insanity. And the doctor who runs the sanatarium next door to the Abbey is concerned about his daughter Mina's harrowing nightmares and unusual behavior. A friend and colleague of the doctor's, Professor Van Helsing, believes he has solved the mystery of the deaths and peculiar behavior that have beset the city and has a plan to combat them.<br /><br />&#34;Dracula&#34; was the first Hollywood production of a film based on Bram Stoker's great novel of the same name. The film is only loosely based on the novel, although its story is closer to Bram Stoker's than the novel's first film adaptation, F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent expressionist masterpiece  &#34;Nosferatu&#34;. 1931's &#34;Dracula&#34; is not as gripping or as thematically complex as &#34;Nosferatu&#34;. And I didn't find it as alluring as Francis Coppola's more faithful 1992 adaptation &#34;Bram Stoker's Dracula&#34;. But this version of &#34;Dracula&#34; is memorable, and it established the image that Count Dracula and vampires in general would have in Hollywood and in our popular culture for decades to come: that of a suave, well-dressed, Old World aristocrat. This DVD contains two versions of the film: The famous English version starring Bela Lugosi and a Spanish version that was filmed on the same sets with a different cast, director, and crew. The English version was filmed during the day, while the Spanish version filmed in the evening. I have to agree with the critical consensus that the Spanish version of &#34;Dracula&#34; is somewhat better than the English version. But it isn't better in every way. I recommend watching both versions. It is interesting to note the differences between the two and compare their failures and successes. English and French subtitles are available for both versions.<br /><br />Most notable about director Todd Browning's English &#34;Dracula&#34; is Bela Lugosi's performance. This movie destroyed Bela Lugosi's career. He was an accomplished character actor before he was Count Dracula. But his performance here forever changed the way cinema saw vampires. They would no longer be the grotesque creatures brought brilliantly to life by Max Schreck and F.W. Murnau in &#34;Nosferatu&#34;. Bela Lugosi's Dracula is as suave as he could be, the embodiment of tall, dark, and handsome. His seduction isn't subconscious or covert. It's obvious. He is at home in polite society and charming to young ladies. His Eastern European accent completes the picture of the mysterious and exotic stranger. Bela Lugosi was a perfect choice for the role since he was Austro-Hungarian himself, a native of what is now Romania.<br /><br />The Spanish version of &#34;Dracula&#34; was directed by George Melford, who did not speak Spanish. Although it was filmed on the same sets at the same time with a very similar script, it is considerably longer than the English version at 104 minutes. The English &#34;Dracula&#34; is 75 minutes long. Carlos Villarias plays Count Dracula in this version. He isn't as good as Bela Lugosi, and this film's opening act in Transylvania doesn't compare with the English version either. There are some interesting differences in the script, the blocking, and the camera work between the two versions. And the Spanish version is more overtly sexual that the English one, as might be expected. But a longer film with a lesser leading man wouldn't seem to make for a better movie. Oddly, it does. The supporting cast deserves the credit for more passionate and interesting performances. And director George Melford wisely gave them the screen time to develop their characters, as well as time for the filmto build some suspense. Eva (Lupita Tovar), who is the &#34;Mina&#34; character, and Van Helsing (Eduardo Arozamena) are simply better-drawn characters than their English counterparts. But the real stand-out performance is by Pablo Alvarez Rubio, who plays Renfield. I was never quite convinced by Renfield's cravings in the English film. But Rubio is entirely convincing: He is mad, but he has great insight. He is racked with guilt at the same time he craves blood. He simultaneously wants to be damned and redeemed. Rubio makes Renfield complex, crazy, entertaining and sympathetic. It is worth watching the film for his performance.upita Tovar), who is the &#34;Mina&#34; character, and Van Helsing (Eduardo Arozamena) are simply better-drawn characters than their English counterparts.

0385504209|5.0|I loved this book! When I read, I want to be totally involved with the story and the characters, and in this book, I was. It reminded me of James Patterson's book- The Jester, which was also very good. I only have time to read at night and want to be relaxed and entertained.I was also captured as I became more involved in this wonderful mystery. I thought it was a great read. I think you will enjoy it too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great show.... FOX always has a problem canceling all the good shows. But I am glad that they released the DVDs.... I hope they bring it back (very unlikely but I still have hope)
055357342X|5.0|If you have ever read a fantasy book and enjoyed it, heres one that should be next on your must reads list if not already on it. The series (A song of ice and fire) is amazing with all it's plots and schemes and tricks and turns.
B000002VMH|4.0|There was no question that Annie Lennox was going to make it solo.  Face it, she was the prominent and more visible part of Eurythmics, while her cohort Dave Stewart did...uh...let's see...  Seriously though, Lennox's first solo effort Diva has her more the queen of bad love and doom, and that deep timbre of a melodic voice of hers rings truly here.  The music here lacks the hooks of Eurythmics songs such as \\"Thorn In My Side\\" or \\"Sweet Dreams.\\"  No, this is a more serious affair.  The bitterness of songs like \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\" are there, though.<br />Synths and high octave piano form a lush but poignant backing on \\"Why\\", on words and thoughts on a life that have never come out into the open, and the life that will be lead instead.  The list of things she describes after the last verse comprises that, \\"the book I never read\\", \\"the words I never said\\", \\"the path I'll never tread\\", etc.  Her whispering \\"I don't think you know how I feel\\" addresses this lack of communication.<br />A kind of brisk tempo highlights the strings-laden \\"Walking On Broken Glass.\\"  The title is in reference to her life, which has been shattered, and hence she feels like she's... well...  A very Buddhist outlook on life is shown when she sings \\"now everyone one of us was made to suffer/everyone of us was made to weep.\\"<br />A slow but steady drum machine sets the tempo for \\"Precious\\", punctuated by bass and airy synths, rejoicing on the arrival of a special one who's a breath of fresh air after being \\"covered up with sadness\\" and being cynical and twisted all the years.  The repeated refrain \\"Well I was lost until you came\\" enhances that message as well.<br />The bitter disappointment of dreams sunken by reality leading to a hard life on a dead end street is what \\"Legend In My Living Room\\" portrays.  With lines as \\"I've shed my tears in bitter drops until the thorn trees bloomed/to take the spiky fruit to crown myself the Queen of doom\\", this is obviously not a happy song.<br />\\"Cold\\" features the same airy synths and pianos as \\"Why,\\" a languid tempo, and Annie's gospel-like soul backing vocals.  Cold is what Annie wants to feel less of lest she be frozen over due to a lack of reciprocated love.  The line that really struck me was \\"Dying is easy, it's living that scares me to death.\\"<br />In \\"Money Can't Buy It\\", Annie sings against materialism and to drive that point home, does a rap where she briefly takes on the persona of a rich white girl whose got so many diamonds she can't close her safe, showing how this girl is \\"lying awake in a sick dream.\\"  Instead, she sings \\"I believe in the power of creation\\" and \\"in love alone.\\"<br />The closest to a Eurythmics song here is \\"Little Bird\\", with its insistent tempo and keyboards.  Shown here is the contrast between a free, flying bird in the sky with a troubled soul weighted to the ground, feeling \\"so dark with rage and fear\\" and wanting the strength to emulate that bird.<br />\\"Primitive\\" is another melodic synth ballad on hopes and prayers to make on strong during the brief life in the ephemeral world.<br />\\"The Gift\\" has Annie at her most desolate, giving a tired disillusioned face on a stifling relationship, and the need to stop \\"living in this same sick joke.\\"<br />The final song \\"Keep Young And Beautiful\\" is a send-up of an upbeat 1920's-style piano ditty extolling the virtues of cuteness and looks and figure for the good life, and never mind about brains.  It even sports scratches from an old LP for effect.<br />More melodic and wistful than anything Eurythmics has done, Diva shows Annie Lennox as a capable solo artist, though a few more uptempo songs could've helped.s the same airy synths and pianos as \\"Why,\\" a languid tempo, and Annie's gospel-like soul backing vocals.

B00005JMF6|2.0|This movie had a few scenes that really made me jump, but then abot 2/3 of the way through, the mood totally changed, and the frightening parts suddenly came to and end. The movie had potential, but was ruined by a weak screenplay.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack summarizes what has become one of the most popular trilogies of all times. It takes us through the final events of Tolkien's masterpiece in a fascinating way, combining sounds that we have come to associate with the characters, the places and events, and narrates musically the story of the final installment of Lord Of The Rings. It is a true masterpiece of music, composed and directed by one of the greatest composers of our times.
B0000C1HLF|2.0|This feature is a far cry from the funny, action-filled, successful first installment in this series.  It's been nearly two days since I've seen it, and I am having a difficult time remembering the plot.  That should give you some kind of idea of what this movie is all about.  What it does best, it does really well.  That would be the action scenes involving our three heroines.  Of course, the fighting and chasing scenes are incredibly unrealistic, but this movie is definitely not about realism.  Rent it if you'd like to see some incredible, albeit computer-generated, action sequences.  However, to those discriminating movie viewers, rent something else.
0375760067|4.0|I greatly enjoyed The Mayor of Casterbridge, not only for its clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy, but also for its themes.  The loss of a wife, mother, daughter, love, husband, father and mentor are all carried off extremely well.  I chose to read this book for a project I'm doing in my English class and although it was not my first choice, I do recommend it to anyone who loves English literature.  I'm a big fan of Dickens and Hardy and truly loved this magnificent piece of work.
B000003TAR|4.0|If Nevermind was the album which brought Nirvana to the masses, In Utero was the one in which the band truly found their voice for the first time. This time around, Kurt Cobain's lyrics have taken a turn for the dark and confessional, and the raw guitar distortion compliments his musical ideas perfectly. <br />At first listen, this album will scare you off due to its sheer abrasion. You will probably wonder why the sudden change in direction? Keep in mind all of the things that happened to Kurt and Nirvana during the time in between Nevermind and In Utero. Nirvana was suddenly catapulted to the forefront of the music world thanks to the success of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; and Kurt was hailed as a John Lennon-esque figure for Generation X, a role which he publicly despised. Also of note was the fact that after his marriage, Kurt and his wife Courtney Love reluctantly became the reigning king and queen of the tabloid gossip columns. All of this plus Kurt's desire to shed his mainstream audience resulted in what eventually became In Utero. <br />Something that is immediately noticeable about this album is the fact that Kurt has changed directions lyrically. There are no slacker Gen-X anthems a la &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; or &quot;Lithium.&quot; Here, within each song Kurt seems to have something to say; he is really laying his heart down on his sleeve in some of these songs. &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; in particular bottles up Kurt's feelings about his childhood and his fame. &quot;Frances Farmer&quot; deals with the stroy of a famed actress from Seattle who was persecuted and put in an insane asylum. Cobain was quite fascinated by her story and through her he relates his own tale of persecution. The sad &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; is one Kurt's most mature and direct songs. The lines &quot;I'm on my time with everyone&quot; and &quot;distill the life that's inside of me&quot; directly communicate the pressure he was feeling and that he just wanted to be left alone for a while. The beautiful, cello-laced &quot;All Apologies&quot; is demonstrative of Kurt's true abilities as a songwriter and also what a great band Nirvana (including Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic) were capable of becoming. The lyrics read as though Kurt is confessing his sins to the world for all to hear. This is beautiful. These few songs prove that Nirvana was coming a long way since Nevermind, and had Nirvana continued, they would have made an even greater album that would have blown this one out of the water. The Unplugged session would go even farther in proving this. As it is, their true potential is only hinted at here, as it will continue to do so for all time.<br />As bold a move as In Utero was, I could not quite give it five stars because there are some flaws present. &quot;Very Ape&quot; is a bit inconsequential, and &quot;Milk It,&quot; although it has some good guitar riffs, really isn't all that good of a song. Plus &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot; didn't really do it for me, although I must say all three of these songs contain some chilling lyrics. However, I think the first half of the album is absoultely flawess in every way; everything from &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; to &quot;Dumb&quot; flows together really well and all are perfect blends of distortion and melody. Also, the song &quot;Tourette's,&quot; while considered filler by some, is really funny if you think about it. The title refers to a mental condition called Tourette's Syndrome, which basically causes people to spew out strings of curse words uncontrollably at random times. This song has no official lyrics, basically Kurt just spews out random noises for the full minute-and-a-half duration. Anyway, bearing the title in mind, it's hilarious to listen to.<br />Like I said, this was the album in which Kurt was beginning to find his voice as a songwriter, and it is just plain impossible to listen to without feeling a slight twinge of sadness knowing that he would never quite fulfill his full potential. For a brief time, Kurt proved to be a guiding light at a time when the music world needed it most, and, unwilling to continue playing the rock and roll game, he foolishly took his own life, which left a gaping hole in the world of '90s alternative rock which to this day has not been completely filled. So wherever you are, Kurt Cobain, I hope you are resting in peace. You wore your heart on your sleeve for the sake of making great music, and you will be missed eternally.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I bought this album on a whim. Glad I did! A truely remarkable album. The voice of Josh Groban does lack in base, but it does not detract from a stunningly beautiful album. He sings in French and English, but you hardly even notice. His voice is remarkable powerful and moving. A MUST HAVE for anyone's CD collection!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I know a lot of people don't like this album because they think it's about money, or some other controversy. Don't listen to them! Most who criticize haven't even heard the album. I don't care who is making money on this album, who isn't, or if its wrong to make it. All I know is that the music on it is absolutely awesome, and that's what its really all about.
B00008PW2D|2.0|I own Seasons 1-4, and had Season 5 been under $20, I would have purchased it just to be complete.  But, and let's face it, Season 5 was terrible anyway!  The writing was WAY OFF and SJP wasn't even likeable, which is hard to believe!  The episode where they took the train and the zit humor was incredibly lame, as so many of the episodes (gee, all 8? ha!) were.  I need to read a synopsis of each episode just to remind myself why I'm glad I'm NOT buying Season 5!
B000002LOE|5.0|Only Automatic For The People can compete.  This is a great rock album.  I wouldn't call it an all-time great, it's not quite of that caliber imo, but nontheless it's a great album.  Buy it for 'Losing My Religion' and 'Endgame' if for nothing else.  Extremely enjoyable listen.
0385504209|2.0|There is no question Dan Brown does his homework when researching a book. I checked much of his data in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and found it solid. The groundwork is compelling and thought-provoking.<br />What is less compelling is a plot that dodges and weaves incoherently. It covers enough ground to span a year but purports to be a day in the life of shallow, unbelievable characters. Brown's cliche-ridden writing is tedious and predictable.<br />As the plot begins to unravel--and &quot;unravel&quot; is the right word--it becomes apparent there will be no satisfactory resolution in this feeble struggle to retell the Grail quest. In the final chapters, the pace quickens in a frantic attempt to tie up all the loose ends. Brown seems to have decided that he had filled his obligatory 400 pages and needed to put an abrupt end to the unsatisfying foolishness he had set up.<br />As a starting point for investigating the many puzzles of history, the Church and its machinations, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a good primer. As literature, it is an abysmal flop.
B00004IC9G|5.0|and one of the best Metal albums ever. Not a bad track on this one . . .
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has changed and this CD makes it apparent. This CD is ten steps up from any of her previous work. Experimenting with many musical and vocal styles, &quot;In The Zone&quot; is a masterpiece, and it should be since she spent two years creating it. Every song is different and has something different to offer. The best female CD to come out this year, Britney has done it again. You don't have to be a previoius fan to enjoy this one. She took some bold new steps, and it was worth it. Congrats to Britney for creating an awesome album. The best song is &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot;. It's very organic with asian influenced sounds. Beautiful song. Keep it up, Ms. Spears. We can expect more great things from you in the future.
B0000D96NX|5.0|Even though i bought MH's last 2 albums.. 1999's 'The Burning Red' and 2001's 'Supercharger', and liked them... I felt that something was missing from those albums that the first 2 albums had. And that was that mischievious edge to MH's sound. Somehow it comes back on this album (prob due to a new guitarist? :P)<BR> <BR> At first listen i didn't know if i liked this album too much, but after a few more listens.. more of the songs were sounding better and better. I've gotten to the point now where i love 5 of the songs and the others are still growing on me. And that is absolutely what i love about music, that it sneaks up on you and takes more than a couple listens for you to get into it. Music like that is the music that will leave an imprint in your mind and that's the kind of music that has integrity through and through and will sound good years and years down the road.<br /> Each time i put 'Through the Ashes of Empires' on i hear something new that i hadnt heard before.. and i smile about it.<BR> On this cd they have some explosive tracks and some mellow ones, like the way MH has been writing in the past few years b/c it is where they're minds are at and you can't blame a band for that. All good bands' styles change eventually and all people in general's taste changes in life. Most tend to mellow out and look at life perspectively and MH seems to be doing that.. all while keeping that harshness intact.. making the whole thing a beauty to behold. Plenty of angst still slices its way thru the 10 tracks and at the right moments the subtle sounds come in.<br /> If you're a first timer of MH you might not 'get' this cd, but then again i don't want to pre-judge anyone's taste in music. So take a risk, you might be pleasantly surprised. And for all real MH fans, you don't wanna pass this one up.<br />LOVE the cover art btw! &gt;:)
B0000CFW87|4.0|The song in the title above is worth the cost of this CD alone.  It restores my faith that actual talent can be &quot;raised up&quot; and acknowledged by the masses.
B00011ZBXO|5.0|This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen.  I live in Indiana so you know they aren't going to show it here regardless of the fact that Michael Alig is from South Bend.  I went to California and on the top of my agenda was to find out where this was playing and I was lucky enough to actually see it.  Believe me, I was not disappointed!<br />McCauley Culkin did an awesome job and made a tremendous choice for a comeback.  (I like anyone who is willing to take a risk.)  And Seth Green was a riot.  Two of my favorite actors in the same film.  The rest of the cast was great too and whoever did the casting was either a genious or really lucky.<br />I wanted to make a comment regarding the fact that alot of people are upset that there were no \\"gay\\" scenes in the movie.  I didn't feel that this movie was about a gay relationship.  It was a movie about a murder.  A cold-blooded murder that was committed by someone that everyone still wants to meet and be friends with.  I think the directors did a magnificent job in getting that feel out and getting that message across to everyone.<br />I am looking forward to owning my own personal copy in February.<br />PS.  I already own the book, the soundtrack and the documentary.  I suggest getting them all.
B00006879E|5.0|this cd is amazing.  i bought the cd for harder to breathe, but found it's actually the weakest track on the cd.  you get the impression that these guys have a bit of jazz flowing through their viens.  buy this cd and i promise you'll enjoy it for a very long time.  everyone within ears distance will ask who it is...tell them it's your next cd buy.
078322737X|4.0|American Graffiti tracks the lives of several kids in a small California town on a late-summer night in 1962, accompanied by a pre-Beatles soundtrack and the famous, stylized DJ Wolfman Jack.  (\\"Now you understand this is a WHITE T-Bird.\\")  Most of them have recently graduated from the local high school.  When it came out in 1973 I saw this movie with a guy born in 1950, a year younger than me (my HS class is 1967), and his girlfriend, who was four years younger than him.  Bernie and I were in stitches from beginning to end.  Barb liked it a lot, too, but she was a little removed from this whole scene of cruising around in cars.  I could say the same of my kids, whose high school classes are 1994 and 1997.  So if you were born, say, in the forties, you may be able to place yourself right inside these characters' lives; whereas if you were not, you won't.  But it's still a very funny movie, and as much a period piece as Sense and Sensibility.<br />It's also a landmark in several ways.  George Lucas directed and co-wrote this film.  (Star Wars would come out four years later.)  Francis Ford Coppola produced it.  It's Harrison Ford's first movie (in a small, very effective role as a drag-racer new to town).  Richard Dreyfuss and \\"Ronny\\" (that's what the DVD box says) Howard appear in very early roles.  The third key player is Paul Le Mat, who is outstanding as the reigning drag-race king and a sort of hero, rock of Gibraltar, to the uncertain, hormone-crazed, misdirected, college-bound characters around him.<br />Together with all the hijinks there is a very winning wistfulness to this movie.  The cruising life isn't what it used to be.  Get out, grow up and pursue those dreams.
B000099T2L|1.0|dangerously in love is honestly the only good song on the cd.  i was very disappointed.  let this be an example to the music industry of why people pirate music.  beyonce' has talent, i just hope she shows it in her next cd.  download dangerously in love off of ITUNES for .99 and pretend the rest of the cd is one of those AOL disc you get in the mail....stay away.
B00005NTNU|5.0|The original Dirty Harry is one of my all time favorite movies...one that i have seen so many times that i almost know the script word for word.  Clint Eastwood was \\"marvelous\\" in the role of Harry Callahan...surpassed only be the various characters he has portrayed in westerns.  However, not to take anything away from Mr. Eastwood, it was Andy Robinson (\\"Scorpio\\") who made the original Dirty Harry movie the best in the series.  In my opinion, Mr. Robinson played the PERFECT madman...better than i have seen in any movie employing such a character.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|check out the local clubs and you'll hear Toxic and Breathe on Me playing.  those two songs along with Me Against The Music are great.  the other songs take time to get use to, but once you do i think you'll like it.  if you really don't wanna buy the cd for 15 or so, go on ITUNES and buy it for 9.99.  have fun and hopefully you'll like the cd.  if not don't call me :)
6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton (Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands, Planet of The Apes, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) came up with the orginal story for this clever film. His imagination is amazing.<br />This film was actually directed by Henry Selick (James and The Giant Peach, Monkeybone)who gave the agles and sequences a great deal of life, charm and magnetism.<br />The story is about the man in charge of Halloween Jack Skellington (Voiced by Chris Sarandon - Fright Night, The Princess Bride) who decides to want to try and take over the Christmas Holiday.<br />Once he realizes what Christmas is all about he discovers that he got it all wrong. With the help of his friend Sally ( Voiced by the talented Cathrine O'Hara - Best In Show, Dick Tracey, Home Alone), he realizes his mistake just when Oogie Boogie (Voiced by Ken Page - All Dogs Go To Heaven, Torch Song Trilogy) threatens to get rid of Sally and Santa Clause himself (Voiced by Ed Ivory - Eye on the Sparrow - and he is also the SINGING voice for Oogie Boogie))<br />You can also hear the talents of Paul Rubens (Pee Wee Herman) as well as William Hickey and Glenn Shadix (Planet of the Apes, Multiplicity).<br />The music is by the incredible Danny Elfman (Chicago, Men In Black, Edward Scissorhands, Hulk, Spider-Man, Planet Of The Apes) who also does the SINGING voice for Jack Skelington. Incredible writing, lyrics and performance by him. He really is a true talent. My favorite is \\"What's This?\\"<br />The DVD extra's are incredible. Making the movie and watching the detail of how each character and scene is produced. Taking three years of photography alone. The Special Edition has many features, graphics and illustrations. Every home should have this one! (12-11-03)
B00005JL78|4.0|Almost. It's got flaws, like any other film, but it's still fun to watch. In fact, it's fun to watch more than once. More importantly: the screenplay is intelligent and all the filmmakers involved contributed to a massive effort to keep the cheese factor to a minimum. Even the special features are good, especially the 30 minute documentary including a good sit down interview with Speilberg and Cruise together. The truth is great SF films are so tortuously rare that any SF enthusiast is happy when even a mildly good one comes along. Speilberg has been chasing an elusive accomplishment for most of his career: a truely great contribution to SF cinema that will still be admired generations from now alongside Kubrick's '2001: A SPace Oddyssey'. Has he finally done it with Minority Report? Not quite. But I'm grateful beyond words that he keeps trying.<br />For more films based on stories by Philip K. Dick see Blade Runner, Imposter, Total Recall, and the upcoming Paycheck. Better yet: just buy some of his books and enjoy. Start with his short fiction. His novels may be a bit much for the uninitiated.
B00005JLSE|4.0|To disagree with another reviewer, I enjoy musicals.  I love the creativity in the lyrics and anytime a movie entertains and puts you in a different time and place is cause for celebration, at least to me.  This movie is All that Jazz and then some and it's probably the next best thing to actually being inside a Broadway theater.   It's music isn't as catchy as those in the recent Disney musicals.  In fact &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot; is the only song I remebered after finishing the movie.  But for the most part it's well made with the sequences of song and dance coming from the main character's (Roxie) imagination rather than bursting out into song after speaking some lines.   Rene Zellwegger plays Roxie Hart, an alduterous murderess, Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelley, imprisoned for killing the other half of her sister act and her boyrfiend.  Normally I don't care for brand name Hollywood stars, but Zellwegger and Zeta-Jones actually are very impressive in this tale and both deserved their Oscar nods.  Rapper Queen Latifah as a corrupt jail warden, shows she can sing too! and John C. Reilly who has the best vocal chords of the lot is terrific in &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;.  The well known Buddhist Richard Gere is slick lawyer Billy Flynn.  I can't remeber if he got an Oscar nomination or not but he was definitely the best actor in the movie, and though he did a credible job of singing, it's his tap dancing that is more memorable.   Also in this film are Broadway's Christine Baranski as Mary Sunshine and Taye Diggs who narrates the film as a jazz club emcee.  Chicago is not the best movie you'll ever see, but as far as entertainment it ranks among the top.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This DVD is everything I expected and more. I never had a chance to watch the VHS but my friend told me that the picture is much crisper and the sound is a lot better on the DVD. The original concert film in the special features section lets you watch them perform all the songs continuously (the best part of the DVD, in my opinion). I've watch this almost everyday after a hard day at work and it just helps me wind down and zone out. I love the fact that the band is performing to an empty amphitheater that is old and weathered. It set the perfect atmosphere for PF's experimental music from that time. I think they wrote their greatest music during this time and the DVD definitely succeeds in capturing that. There is not one performance that I did not like or that I felt needed a little more oomph to it. \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\" is one of my favorite songs and the performance was absolutely amazing. For a moment, I forgot I was watching a DVD. The editing throughout the concert was simple but still effective and impressive to me considering it was filmed in the early 70s. The director's cut adds some interesting and comical clips of the band eating and talking and footage of them recording Dark Side of the Moon in the studio. I think anyone who has good taste and an appreciation for good music will enjoy this DVD.
0385508417|4.0|When I started to read this book, I didn't like it. I think it's because of the stubbornness of Luther Krank. Luther and Nora Krank are skipping Christmas, for their daughter, Blair, is away from home for helping other people in Peru with the Peace Corps. Luther decides to take the Caribbean cruise instead of doing Christmas. The way Luther determines not to celebrate Christmas bored me. I was like tired of reading how he acts. But as I continued with the book, I found it interesting to see how Luther has done to show he won't do Christmas this year, and they are going to the luxury Island Princess, then everything is like &quot;....bboooommmm....&quot; Blair is calling from Miami airport that she is going to take her fianc&eacute;e, Enrique, a Peruvian doctor, home for &quot;American Christmas.&quot; When I read that, I was like &quot; Yeahhh! &quot; Everything is changed since that call, for Nora does not tell Blair the truth. Poor Luther, who was so eager with his cruise, now has to do what he determined not to do several days earlier. I was really laughing when I read Chapter 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. I won't tell what happens. You check it out yourself so that you could enjoy the book... And I don't know why, but when I read through chapter 18, I felt the warmth and kind of neighbors. I felt like I wanted to be there, in Hemlock Street.<br /><br />  Now, I have just finished the book. I can say I love it. I just could not stop reading since the call of Blair in chapter 12. I usually love to read books having contents with a lot of thinkings or books that make you think about life, about facts, or books that you could end up with something meaningful. But this book is different. You don't have to think a lot or go deeper into the ideas of the author to find another meanings or whatever... But..Yes, this's a good book. You'll enjoy it.

B00008PW2D|1.0|This is the weakest season of the series. It was a real disappointment.  I felt that some of the stories were unbelievable and didn't keep with the characters that had been developed in previous seasons.  It's sad to see a series decline like this.
B00004RFFS|2.0|I very much looked forward to this movies release. Having read the famous book upon its publication, I, like many, had my own vision about who should play whom, and how it should unfold. Such obsession can only bring disappointment, and this movie certainly did that, for me. Though the production values are lavish, I found it was totally mis-cast. Tom Cruise is, I'm sure, a nice person, as his constant gleeful grimace would suggest. But, in my opinion, he is just not that good of an  actor. He has done some decent roles, and says all of his lines with all the conviction he can muster. But his casting as &quot;Lestat&quot; totally ruined this movie for me. You are never not aware that this is Tom Cruise you are watching. I also found Brad Pitt awful as &quot;Louis&quot;. He says his lines as if he's very uncomfortable with the words coming from his mouth, as if he's reading them from a monitor. I really don't blame these stud-muffins for being cast, as this is what sells movies to the general public. But I would much rather have seen two excellent unknowns, of which there are many, play these roles. Antonio Banderas is laughable as &quot;Armand&quot;, not only mis-cast, but he says his lines as if his mouth is full of marbles. Stephen Rey, cast hot off the heels of his role in &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, acts insane. There are also several roles, such as one of the female vampires in &quot;The Theatre de Vampires&quot;, which could have been beautifully developed into a brief but memorable, sensual, horrifying role. Instead, we get some blousy redhead who cavorts like Joan Rivers. This movie needed to be crafted with skill and depth, and it just wasn't. It has all the mystique of almost any rock video, glossy, glamorous, and disposable. It should have had the atmosphere of a film such as, say,  the original &quot;Cat People&quot;, a film made with a small budget, before special effects, but which still weaves such dark suspense and horror with its skill and subtlety. Again, when a movie is made from a hugely popular book such as this one, it's almost always bound to be a disappointment, and, for me, this movie is no exception. I really wanted to like it, and went into its viewing with the upmost of anticipation and optimism, despite the casting. But, as it progressed I slowly had to concede that this film had no &quot;soul&quot;, it was made to please the masses, most of whom  have no taste. A lousy movie, made to be cast into video oblivion, where it now lies..

B000069HK2|5.0|The Used is the best cd I have heard in awhile. I have had this album in my cd player since it came out... The first track I heard was box full of sharp objects, on one of the used old videos back in early 2002. Since then I have been a fan. I hope they come play Seattle again soon!!!! BUY THIS ALBUM! <BR>favorite track: On my own(It just goes deep for me)
B00005JKCH|1.0|If the comic book were as bad as this movie, the movie would have never been made.  The only thing in this movie that I can remember is that the Green Goblin looks like Donald Rumsfeld.  Other than that, its a yawner.
B00009KO09|2.0|The movie was great, I enjoyed it so much in the theaters that I bought it when the DVD came out.  But I was so disappointed to find out that there is NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES in this DVD (3-disc special edition, Canada), only French subtitles.  It may be trivial to others, but it's something that I want and think should be standard in the DVD.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I felt that this was the weakest film of the series because it concentrated too much on characters that I did not really want to identify with. I think it did not spend enough time on the principle characters and Morpheus does very little in this film. Although the ending is not bad, the Zion attack scene was not what I really wanted to see and the dialogue is pretty corny at times. I think this is a flawed movie and not a very good addition to the Matrix series. Reloaded was better but the original is still the best.
B00000IO4J|4.0|Ok, number one it was Elijah Wood in it. Admittidly this was the only reason I wanted to see it, but then when I did see it I liked it, and not just for Elijah.<BR>This film consists of a group of main characters who are all outsiders in some way at their school. Elijah plays Casey who is the geek, Jordana Brewer plays the object of fancy, Delilah and Josh Hartnett (Peaal Harbour) plays Zeke the dropout who's back etc<BR>Although classified as a horror, the main shock is right at the beginning of the film!! Little shocks throughout, but personally not many by my standards.<BR>The plot is that aliens have landed and are taking over the school, this group of outsiders are the last ones left and have to stop it before it gets out of control. Yet, the twist is that one of the group IS the alien, but who? I good film and I enjoyed it
B00005JMC6|5.0|This was the heart-warming tale of a young Maori girl trying desperately to gain the acceptance of an old-fashioned grandfather and to prove herself worthy to lead her people back to their roots.  <br />It is a classic tale that crosses cultural boundaries;  it shares age-old views on the clash between traditional and modern.  Bolstered by wondeful acting, especially by the young Keisha Castle-Huges, this movie is one that will truly inspire you! <br />It's one to watch again and again.  Highly recommended!
B000089RVX|3.0|This is an entertaining album... I just always thought that Lacuna Coil was a band that deserved more attention and now it seems that these guys are getting it instead. So if you like this, do yourself a favor and check out LC too.
0345452577|1.0|I could not get into this book. I have the audio version. My mind kept wondering off. I had to stop listening to it half way trough it. I love all the Alex and Milo book. Please keep writing them instead.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is a phenominal singer, songwriter, producer, performer, musician, and 5 time Grammy winner! At the age of 21, she has already captured all the accolades that can be bestowed upon a musical artist. She's a rare talent that comes along once in a decade. She has only touched the surface of her enormous musical ability.<br />As I carefully listened to her new CD \\"The Diary of Alicia Keyes\\", I was blown away! She takes \\"Neo-Soul\\" to the next level with this collection of geat songs. Every song on the CD is either very good or great! If you are a lover of R&B, Jazz, Soul, Hip-Hop, or appreciate very good music, you'll love this CD.<br />My favorites are:<br />1)\\"You don't know my name\\" --- A classic. . . the best song on the CD. I really love when Alicia croons the chorus \\"OOOOH,OOOOH, You don't know my name\\"!<br />2)\\"If I ain't got you\\" --- This is a sweet, sweet song with a lot of emotion and a good message.<br />3)\\"Diary\\" --- Beautiful song of having total trust and confidence in your lover to keep your secrets.<br />4)\\"If I were your woman/ Walk on by\\" --- I'm sure Gladys Knight is proud of Alicia's rendition of her classic song.<br />5)\\"Karma\\" --- Haunting hook, nice beats and great production.<br />6)\\"When you really love someone\\" --- This song sounds like \\"Fallin\\" and \\"A woman's worth\\".<br />7)\\"Slow Down\\" --- Alicia's vocals are so sweet and seductive on this track.<br />8)\\"Wake up\\" --- This song sounds a little like \\"Lovin U\\".<br />Alicia Keys is truly blessed with remarkable musical talent and it's scary that at - 21 - she will only get better with every CD she releases. The sky's the limit for this beautiful songstress!
B0000AMJEH|1.0|This movie showed us a whole new level of bad movies.  From the unrealistic car scenes, to the abundant plot holes this movie has you falling asleep from the beginning.  The first movie showed us that nitrous can make a car slightly faster, but the second movie showed us that nitrous will allow you to reach light speed somehow.  When the cars in this movie use nitrous it somehow has the same effect as the space ships do in Star Wars when they travel through light speed.  When anyone seems to use nitrous everything gets kind of burry and all you see are streaking lights like Star Wars uses. All the car scenes in this movie are totally unrealistic.  The fact that we are supposed to believe that an EVO and an Eclipse are going to stand a prayer next to a Saleen Mustang, a Dodge Viper, and a Corvette Z06 is very insulting to anyone in the automotive world. The plot in this movie leaves nothing to the imagination as we are supposed to believe that this Paul Walker guy turns up missing and the police are after him, but then the next thing we know he is working for the police with his buddy who was also running from the law at one point.  This is a movie that you want to miss!
0385504209|4.0|A couple of years ago, a friend recommended Dan Brown's 'Angels &amp; Demons' to me, which I read and thoroughly enjoyed.  Because of that, 'Da Vinci Code' was a must read for me.<br />The story really gets started in the Louvre, with the mysterious and gruesome death of a curator, along with a secret post mortem message delivered via Mona Lisa. From here the adventure begins, and the reader is whisked on a whirlwind tour of Europe in an exciting quest to solve a mystery that has haunted generations.<br />I enjoyed the first half of the book tremendously.  The plot moves quickly, keeping the reader engaged, and the characters are fairly well developed.  The story line was, at times, a little over the top.  But, hey, this is fiction, so why not?<br />In the second half of the book, Dan Brown seemed to lose the momentum he had built up.  I didn't lose interest completely, but had definite moments of ennui.  He wrapped up the story just in the nick of time.  Overall, I really enjoyed the story, and definitely had developed a very strong interest in the history  and myster of Mary Magdalene.<br />On a fun little side note, some time after finishing the book, I found this website ([...]) which provided a great afternoon's entertainment of mystery solving.

B00005221L|1.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about with this one.  Alien and Aliens are so much better.  I liked the score and cinematography and there is occasionally some decent gore thrown in here and there.  Otherwise this is a pretty lame movie.  See Die Hard 1&amp;3, Hunt For Red October or Last Action Hero for a good John Mctiernan film.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is one of those cd's where EVERY song is good, not just half the cd or a few songs, but all of them. There are good beats and fun to listen to at home to wake me up in the morning or in the car going where ever. This is one of my all time favorites, definetly her best cd!
0385504209|5.0|This thriller starts off fast from the beginning and never slows. From the opening pages this suspense filled novel makes you grip your seat tensely awaiting the next encapsulating event. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon has no idea what he has gotten himself into when he submits a rough copy of a book to his editor for review. The book, holding many links to ancient pagan religions and references catches the eye of one Jacques Sauniere, renowned for his position as curator of the Louvre museum in Paris. When Robert is aroused out of bed by the French police to investigate the murder of Jacques Sauniere, he ends up in a precarious situation. Wanted for a murder that he did not commit, Robert, with the help of French symbologist Sophie Neveu, eludes the French police while helping to discover a secret in danger of being lost forever. Taking many different perilous and deceiving paths and solving riddle after riddle throughout the book, this duo inches closer every moment to discovering something capable of changing history. This book keeps you guessing until the final pages, leaving you stunned with its amazing ideas and raw brilliance.<br /> This book holds so much for every reader to be amazed by that it is hard to pick certain points that you liked about it. One of the best things about this novel is the ingenious riddles that fill the pages. The mind games located throughout The Da Vinci Code consume you and keep you guessing with every new puzzle. Also, suspense is present from the very first paragraphs, making the book that much more unbearable to put down. Geography buffs and people familiar with certain parts of England as well as France can get an extra dimension out to this book because of the real life places the story takes place in. It is hard to name all the pros regarding this novel, this is sure to be a classic in years to come.<br /> Though The Da Vinci Code is seeping with good moments all the way through, it is not impervious to several minute flaws. One small problem with a character in this novel name Bezu Fache near the end of his role causes the reader to have to change their view of the person entirely. This sudden character change effects how you think of the start of the story and takes a slight edge, if possible, off of a part in the novel. Also, the description regarding another person's motions and positions towards the end of the novel lacks fluency. More detail is needed to totally convince the book's audience of several events that occur near the end of the book. With these two minor book foibles perfected, this novel would have been near perfect.<br /> It is clear after reading The Da Vinci Code that this book should be broadly recommended everywhere. Though known as fiction, the story makes you think what the world would have been like if history had been recorded differently or through different opinions. With very few errors, it is hard to put down this novel in any way. You will be on the edge of your seat for the majority of the story and will be amazed by the riddles and supposed ancient secrets that you discover. In conclusion, this thrilling mystery is a must read for all, grasping the minds of thousands with its secrets, twists, and turns..

B00001OH7U|5.0|Station to Station by all standards is a masterpiece of late 70's progressive (and so-called art rock). This was (at the time) an unconscious-transitional effort where David Bowie was pondering in the funk and disco sounds of 1975's Young American's but also sinking into the despair of his heroin addiction and gender-based insecurties amidst his work with Iggy Pop and Brian Eno in the late 70's.<br />Station T.S. would mark an immediate end to David (Jones') Bowie's obsession with all things needing to being American. Definately the first very impressive / creative rock n' roll step Bowie has accomplished. It's a marvel of roboticized, snythesized, polished, dissonance. Not easy to warm to. It serves as it's own distinct album, and yet, a great leap forward lyrically and sonically in comparison to it's predacessor, 1975's Young Americans. <br />Bowie instantly dubbed himself \\"The Thin White Duke\\" which brought him much unwanted publicity. An example was when he admitted that his Thin White Duke outfit was a product of Sears Robuck. Bowie became an instant legend with the incredible \\"Golden Years\\". \\"Stay\\" is a 6 minute plus funk-rocker that never gets old. \\"TVC-15\\" most explicity displays Bowie's emerging robotic behavior that would be prominent throughout \\"Heroes\\".<br />After the albums completion, David gave a controversial Nazi salute to Britain just prior to flying off on a plane to Berlin. At the time, Berlin was as Bowie put it, \\"The Heroin capital of Europe.\\" It seems strange to me that a man in such emotional / physical hurt and despair would be at the height of his creativity but apparently he was and it served him handsomely.
B0000B1OGD|5.0|This 1969 release by Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer was a flop upon it's initial release.  A change of studio heads at Warner Bros. caused the film to be ignored in terms of advertising and publicity. Now you can see it in all it's glory. Widescreen, digitally remastered, with a documentary featuring praise by the ILM team.  The stop motion animation is superb. Over the years, the film has gained a cult following due to video and cable.  It's strange mix of cowboys and dinosaurs (with a stronger emphasis on the dinosaurs) is charming, and the film can be viewed by all ages. A must for Harryhausen fans, even if you own the video
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell has explored virtually every musical and emotional nook and cranny during her lengthy and distinguished career - but &quot;Blue&quot; stands apart as her greatest acheivement. While instrumentally spare, the lyrics and melodies that comprise &quot;Blue&quot; are uncommonly rich, somethow grabbing one's attention immediately while revealing even more upon repeated listening.<br />Listen to the title song, a love lament (apparently targeted at James Taylor, her then-boyfriend) that at first glance doesn't seem to have a structure, but somehow resonates long afterwards. &quot;River&quot; is more than just a breakup song, with its Christmas imagery starkly juxtaposed against Mitchell's angst. At the same time, Joni can be downright playful - &quot;California&quot; makes me grin from ear to ear every time I hear it (cool pedal steel work by the legendary Sneaky Pete) and even &quot;Carey&quot; (featuring Steve Stills's loping bass line) still stands up despite its heavy radio play in 1971.<br />&quot;Blue&quot; is (I believe) the best possible starting point in exploring Joni Mitchell's career, as it catches her blurring the line among pop, folk and jazz genres, breaking out of the hippie/folkie mold, and becoming an artistic force who would influence many for years to come.
0385504209|5.0|I usually feel like I'm goofing off if I read pop-fiction.  Anything but classics or non-fiction is just a step better than TV.<br />This books has the best of both worlds.<br />It's an absolutely gripping, keep-you-up-all-night-to-finish type of a read, with a beautifully woven plot.<br />But it also builds on fascinating history.  Some of it is considered a bit of a controversial version of history, but nevertheless, I felt like I was able to indulge in fiction without completely goofing off with this one!
B0000AQS0F|1.0|The show was canceled due to terrible ratings. No one watched it, no one wanted it and let's face it, it was dull.<br />Watch a real western or Sci-fi movie, not Whedon's little ego trip.

It's laid out so well that someone who's never seen a gym could understand the basic by reading the first few chapters of this book.  Also, the book goes in-depth enough that a seasoned lifter like myself can learn from it.  I keep this and the original Arnold Encyclopedia (the yellow paper back version) around my personal training gym for quick motivation flipping through the awesome pictures or to re-study advanced techniques for stubborn bodyparts.  Highly recommended.
1400034779|5.0|This is an unpretentious book, in size and scope, but its entertainment value is immense. There are no car chases or shoot-outs; no great earth-shattering truths are revealed. The heroine, Smith's &quot;Number One Lady Detective,&quot; is in fact Batswana's ONLY lady detective. But she and those she deals with in her brand-new profession--her friends, clients and victims--were enough to keep me turning the pages. Precious Ramotswe is a delight. She is plump, shrewd and opinionated, as at home in her village and her country as Tony Hillerman's Jim Chee is on his reservation. She solves her little mysteries with a logic, dogged resourcefulness and sense of humor that are quietly brilliant. Smith's prose is well-crafted, spare and subtle; he doesn't beat a reader over the head with Africa and its history, but lets us witness both the uniqueness and the universality of Precious' small-town, open-country world through her very human eyes. I'm hooked; I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.<br />Susan O'Neill, Author: Don't Mean Nothing: Short Stories of Viet Nam
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been a fan of dream theater for quite some time now, and I have to say that I don't rank the albums for quality or artistic merit.  <br />Dream Theater wrote the album in three weeks.  That ends a lot of the griping about it being thrown together or not as artsy as other ones.<br />I think the album is a logical step in their whole continuum throughout their career.  The last album dabbled in some of the rawer, heavier tones that dominate this new album.  The keyboards, for example, have become less of a lead instrument since Jordan Rudess has been aboard.  He's really added some interesting textures and soundscapes to the base of the mix.  The sounds coming from him on this album have changed.  When he does play leads, they're not as over the top as usual.  HE's got a new sound for his leads, too.  He's always changing that.  John Petrucci is playing progressively better on each album.  This one pushes the boundaries of what it means to play rock guitar, once again.  he's using different guitars, and Mike portnoy also has a new snare sound for the record.<br />Overall, there isn't as much experimentation in uncharted sounds...  There's a great amount of honing in good, familiar tones, tweaking here and there, so sonically, it's a very polished sounding prog metal record.  James Labrie sounds a lot stronger on this album than the last one.  <br />The songs have incredibly heavy, catchy riffs.  The themes are a lot more solid.  If you like the mystery of the lyricism in earlier dream theater, you may not like this album - it seems to be a bit more in your face in the lyrical area.  Listen to honor they father, as i am, and in the name of god, and you'll get the picture.  They seem to be kind of boring subjects... Never liked Dream Theater's lyrics anyway... Not unless John Myung writes them... but that's only because he sounds kind of mystical when he writes... NOt because it makes any sense or touches me in a profound way.<br />Anyway, it's a heavy album with superb writing, in my opinion.  The guitar playing is out of this world, the drumming is pretty standard for mike portnoy.  There really isn't a whole lot of technical experimentation in terms of the chops of these musicians, other than with John Petrucci.  The mix doesn't sound nearly as wide open as sdoit.  It sounds very compressed, very clean cut, and kind of sterile at times.  I'll give critics that.  But overall the artwork is very cool for the insert, it's nice and short, but has a nice long instrumental toward the end with some cool little nods to King Crimson and the Beatles in it.  it's an easy transition for, say, metallica fans, or anyone looking to jump into prog metal.  It's not too over the top, that's for sure.  A nice one for beginners, but an album that veteran dream theater fans like me can really appreciate.  It's hard for me to explain the overwhelming mood each album has to me.  Each is very consistent, and I like what they do each time.  Every time they come out with a new album, i wonder what on earth they'll do to top the last, and they always surprise me in that sort of predictable kind of way... I think it's less predictability, and more that their songs and moods are accessible, despite their complex facades.
B00000DCHI|5.0|One of my favorite Billy Joel albums has been his Greatest Hits: Volume I &amp; Volume II.  I was given the cassette version for my birthday in 1986 -- at one of my last really big birthday bashes when I reached the advanced age of 23.  I played that cassette to death -- literally -- and it served as a morale booster when romances soured, deadlines loomed (I was a student journalist at the time) or went overseas to study Spanish in Seville, Spain.<br />Fortunately, shortly before that much-listened-to cassette went to the Big Walkman in the Sky I was given my first stereo system with a CD component, and one of my first purchases was this 2-disc set of 25 of Joel's most popular songs.  Starting with 1973's \\"Piano Man\\" and concluding with \\"The Night is Still Young,\\" this collection shows the many faces of Joel (the musician).<br />I was still new to the whole CD technology thing and had not really looked at the song list on the back cover, so there were quite a few surprises in store for me when I first played disc 1 on my CD player.  I had, obviously, played the cassette so many times that I knew what songs would play and how long they were, so when I heard \\"Piano Man\\" fade out, I expected to hear \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood.\\" Instead, I heard \\"Captain Jack\\" (a morbidly ironic ode to the decadence of the rich, spoiled and unhappy young men) and \\"The Entertainer\\" (a very upbeat yet ironic song about the lifestyle of a rock singer).  I was also pleasantly surprised by the song-within-a-song of \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,\\" with its reflective prologue and epilogue serving as musical bookends for what Joel calls \\"The Ballad of Brenda and Eddie.\\"<br />Another happy discovery was that disc 1 contains the complete rendition of \\"Just The Way You Are,\\" which on the cassette was truncated.<br />The second CD had fewer surprises, since the play list was almost identical to the cassette edition.  The only differences were the inclusion of a \\"live' rendition of Joel's beautiful ballad \\"She's Got A Way\\" and a full rendition of \\"Pressure.\\"  Other than that, all the songs I had memorized and sometimes sang along to (\\"Goodnight Saigon,\\" \\"Uptown Girl,\\" \\"For The Longest Time\\" and \\"Tell Her About It\\") were where my ears and mind expected them to be.<br />This album has been re-released, tweaked and repackaged a few times.  Not only have the two discs been included in the 4-CD Greatest Hits Limited Edition box set, but also they have been digitally remastered and placed in a smaller \\"slimline\\" jewel box (which I hate).  The late 1990s re-issue boasts not only 24-bit digital remastering but also CD Extra videos designed to work with personal computers using Windows 95/98 or better operating systems.<br />If you are a dedicated Joel fan, you probably either own this or need no urging from me to purchase this album.  But for new listeners who have yet to discover the many styles and moods of one of America's best pop/rock songwriter/performers, this set is definitely worth listening to.  If the 4-disc box set is out of stock (as it sometimes is) or too expensive, buy this along with his 1997 Greatest Hits Volume III 1-disc album.eautiful ballad \\"She's Got A Way\\" and a full rendition of \\"Pressure.\\"  Other than that, all the songs I had memorized and sometimes sang along to (\\"Goodnight Saigon,\\" \\"Uptown Girl,\\" \\"For The Longest Time\\" and \\"Tell Her About It\\") were where my ears and mind expected them to be.<br />This album has been re-released, tweaked and repackaged a few times.

The late 1990s re-issue boasts not only 24-bit digital remastering but also CD Extra videos designed to work with personal computers using Windows 95/98 or better operating systems.<br />If you are a dedicated Joel fan, you probably either own this or need no urging from me to purchase this album.  But for new listeners who have yet to discover the many styles and moods of one of America's best pop/rock songwriter/performers, this set is definitely worth listening to.  If the 4-disc box set is out of stock (as it sometimes is) or too expensive, buy this along with his 1997 Greatest Hits Volume III 1-disc album.
0679428895|5.0|In this masterfully written book, the action takes place a few days before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. <BR>Since everyone knows it's going to erupt since the beginning of the book but the characters in the story do not it adds a healthy dose of suspense throughout the book. All of the characters in the book could be considered simple at first look but I asssure you that they're very complicated and interesting to read about.<BR>In short: Pompeii is a great book that is highly recommended to those who are considering reading it, and those who aren't...
0792844890|4.0|In Hollywood, parody is perhaps one of the more sincere forms of admiration, and every genre has inspired at least one satirical or at least zany parody, and for years Mel Brooks was the undisputed King of Kitsch.<br />Brooks' best films in this category are, of course, Blazing Saddles (a spoof of Westerns) and Young Frankenstein, his hilarious black-and-white take on Universal's 1930s \\"creature features.\\"  Both of these films launched frequent Brooks' player Gene Wilder into comic-leading man stardom for a while, and no other Brooks film since has been as successful or laugh-till-your-sides-ache funny, although a few of his later parody-driven films are still amusing and worth a look.<br />One of the few is 1987's Spaceballs, which takes on the sci-fi/space opera genre -- specifically, the Star Wars saga -- and takes every cliche and plot device ever used in those films.  Starting with a Star Wars-like title crawl and taking comic license with the famous opening shot from Episode IV (a seemingly endless starship rumbles across the screen for what seems like an hour and sporting the cheeky bumper sticker \\"We Brake For Nobody\\") and climaxing with the obligatory final showdown between hero and villain, Spaceballs crams references from the Classic Star Wars Trilogy and tosses in bits of Star Trek, Alien and everything in between.<br />Bill Pullman (Lone Starr) fares well as the hero figure (who is a cross between Luke Skywalker and Han Solo), who flies across the stars on his Space Winnebago.  His copilot and pal Barf (the late, great John Candy) is a \\"mog\\" -- half man, half dog -- who's his \\"own best friend.\\"  Together, this odd duo is caught up in the slight plot pitting the evil Spaceballs against the peaceful (if rather bland) inhabitants of Planet Druidia.  The Spaceballs want to steal the Druids' air, and under the command of Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis), they send a huge starship to carry out their dastardly plan.<br />But when they abduct Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) as she flees her own wedding, the Spaceballs get more than what they bargained for.  Feisty and bratty, she proves to be more than a match for Dark Helmet, and when she is rescued by Lone Starr and Barf, all kinds of fireworks explode.<br />The cast is rounded out by Dick Van Patten, George Wyner, Joan Rivers (as the voice of Vespa's droid Dot Matrix) and, of course, Mel Brooks in a double role, the Spaceballs' incompetent President Skroob and the wise sage Yogurt.<br />As in all Mel Brooks' films of this vein, the gags are fast, furious and are a mixture of salacious humor, ridiculous one-liners, in-jokes and visual puns.  Some are ho-hum, but there are enough funny bits in this movie to make it watchable. Still, this parody just doesn't reach the comic heights of Blazing Saddles.....uniga) as she flees her own wedding, the Spaceballs get more than what they bargained for.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is the best music I have listened to EVER. I would HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS ITEM. I own the other two soundtracks but this is by far the best!
B00008DDXC|5.0|That's the first word that came to mind about this movie.  Darker.  But then, having read all the books, I expected it.  The stories just get darker from here, which suits me just fine. This movie was fantastic.  Dobby looks exactly how I pictured him while reading the book, and he's as annoying and loveable as the book version.  And while it is dark, it's not scary, at least my kids didn't think so (they are 9 and 6), so I wouldn't worry too much about showing this to children, but I would wait until they were school age. Besides, they are reading these books to your kids in school anyways!  Harry Potter, while certainly the most controversial literary figure since Tom Sawyer, plays out beautifully on the screen, and I myself can't wait until the next movie in June, which promises to be even Darker and more suspenseful than this one! Too bad I already know the ending.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I've watched this (3) times since receiving it as a birthday gift on November 19 and I'm still not tired of it!  Great performance from SHANIA!  A MUST-HAVE for any SHANIA fan!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|If that's even possible.  I loved the first one, and I was absolutely in love with this one even more!  Wolverine and Nightcrawler are probably my favorite characters, both in the movie, and in the comics.  So the fact that this one had Nightcrawler made me extremely happy.  The story in this one is even better, the action is more intense and exciting, and the effects are brilliant!  Nightcrawler's ability looks absolutely real, you actually believe that he's teleporting, and it looks awesome.  Great great movie.  The only sore spot, if any, is Halle Berry.....I've never liked her, but luckily she's not in this one much, and I've heard rumours that she's not in the next one at all.  Fine by me!
B00004ZELJ|5.0|This is so good but I really do prefer it on DVD because this is something that's worth watching over and over again. Besides videos are so out of date and they get worn out if you watch it a lot of times so DVD is the way to go. All right so I'm a fan of DVDs becauswe I'm a high - tech kind of girl. Nick and Brian'sw mine so hands off.
B000001F9N|4.0|Taking into consideration all that disco has become, with 12&quot; extended singles, extra long remixes and special versions...this is one of the albums that has paved the way. It's lush and orchestral melody is very unique, and creates a musical story without many tracks...all of which tie in together rythmically and complement one another.<br />Donna Summers and her collaboration with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellote is indeed a rare and special occurence, which has resulted in one of the most important pieces in disco history.
B000002HH9|3.0|Those who think that this is the weakest Cure CD are wrong.<BR>I think Faith and Japanese Whispers are both worse than this one. This album has its moments, but also has its let downs.<br />If you are a Cure fan, you should get the album for the following songs:<BR>This Is A Lie<BR>Jupiter Crash<BR>Treasure<BR>Bare<br />There are average ones like:<BR>Club America<BR>Strange Attraction<BR>Mint Car<BR>Gone!<BR>Trap<br />The rest of the CD is really dull and uninspired. I wonder why they choose The 13th for the radio, it is one of the weakest songs on the album. The weakest is - and I am sure most fans will agree with me - Round &amp; Round &amp; Round.<br />The opening track, Want is interesting. Smith always starts his albums with a strong opening track, like he did on The Top (Shake Dog Shake), Kiss Me (The Kiss), Disintegration (Plainsong) and Wish(Open). When I compare Want to these opening songs I realize that Want is less good than the ones I listed above. When listening to Want as &quot;just a song&quot;, it's quite good. Still, for me as an opening track is below average from The Cure.<br />All in all, every Cure fans should have this album in his/her collection, though it's not their best, or not even close to it.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I kind of hooked off off the Beard clib after hearing the still to me SNOW, I know that other people will not be thankfull to me with writing this. But perhaps I need to let it grow, and is the growing in my opinion not going fast enough. Too my the Beard was on its highest peak with V. That was an amazing album, and surprisingly several songs and from that period have finally landed on Testimony. Could it have gotten any beter than this, I guess not. Cos V was a very very good album.<br />Is Testimony a good album too ? We'll I think its a bit suddle to say its good. I rather like to use the word, brilliant. Too me it really blew me off my socks. I had read so much reviews about the album and I more and more got interested in what the album really would be. After I read a review of Neals Solo concert in the Dutch IO pages I was sold and I deceided to give it a try. I putted it on yesterday and I really blew my off my socks. I never expected this. I like to say that everything they tried to achieve with SNOW is been realized with Testimony, its concept album of a short 135 minutes, and some of the songs are among the most beautifull Neal ever composed, I can tell you that. The good part to me was the use of so many orchestral instruments. To me that often makes music very sensitive and this cd is no exception.<br />The whole album got a somewhat strange touch by the fact that Neal explains in a certain way to us how that he founded God. Im not a religious person, rater on the contrary and even me must say that I do found the lyrics distorbing. This was however what really feared me, since Im not waiting for a gospel album at all. But I think the message Neal (who oviously likes to let us share in his discovery) is ratter suddle and not so indoctrinative as some Christians have the habbit to be. And Im glad for that, cos that could have runes my pleasure, but thankfully it did not. Its said Neal founded God after he almost lost his daughter, but came back to him in the end, and did not die. I heard Neal was literly crying on stage when he told the audience about this experience, so the album is something really personal and sensitive. And that is what you constantly feel in the music.<br />For some reason I came to the relation Neal Morse - Peter Gabriel and Im wondering if he follows that man in his footsteps. Genesis releases 5 studio albums, 2 live albums and one double concent album. After that Peter left the band. Same goes with the Beard 5 studio, 2 live and one concept double and Neal left. Both the lamb and Snow are about a boy finding his way in New York while he grows up.the end, and did not die.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain is a beautiful and talented women who believes in herself and her ability. This DVD shows us all just how talented a women she is. The songs are great ones from the past and absolute blow outs for new songs. You add that with the beauty she has and her caring for her fans and you have the best female singer there is. This DVD is great and one for the books and your DVD collection.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I have to confess, I wasn't sure if Mrs. Keys could match Songs In A Minor as most have failed to repeat such success with their 2nd album. BOY DID SHE PROVE ME WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is definately a lot of growth on this album. This is not your typical R&amp;B record, each song actually has meaning and not just a beat to dance to. It is very intimate, if you take away the music and listen to the words this album will definately touch your heart (That is if you are human :-). Although I love all of the songs, my favorites would have to be 'Diary', 'If I Ain't Got U', and 'When U Really Love Someone'. The lyrics are absolutely amazing and heartfelt. If you are expecting to hear detailed info of her everyday life, you will not find it here. What you will find are matters of the heart.

1573301183|5.0|After singing the wrong lyrics during the 4th song on the DVD, Sludge Factory, Layne Staley asks the crowd, &quot;What's my motivation here?&quot;  Indeed, Layne may have lacked the motivation to fully prepare for the performance, since he was overly reliant on the lyric sheets throughout.  Guitarist Jerry Cantrell also seemed a little apprehensive throughout about Staley's ability to perform; he was, after all, beginning to show the symptoms of heroin abuse that AIC's music had foreshadowed.  (Check out Cantrell's nervous glances at the beginning of Angry Chair, the one song in which Staley played the guitar in addition to singing...Jerry's so preoccupied with Layne that he almost forgets to start singing).  Layne proved, however, that no matter how much havoc heroin can wreak on memory, motivation, and ultimately the ability to sustain life, some things are too powerful to be compromised by any substances.  Staley's voice and the beauiful acoustic music he and the rest of Alice In Chains created here are examples of such things.  Nutshell is one of my favorite AIC songs, and that was a great way to open.  You realize that the lyric &quot;If I can't be my own...I'd feel better dead&quot; isn't much of an exaggeration.  Nutshell is followed by Brother, a song that has maybe the most memorable 10 seconds of the entire show when the music stops completely, leaving just Staley and Cantrell to sing the mournful lyrics in harmony.  After Brother, Layne greets the crowd, then says &quot;this song is called No Excuses,&quot; as if the people there wouldn't be able to recognize one of their biggest hits.  After No Excuses, Layne seems to be intensely focused on the lyric sheet while the rest of the band takes a short break.  We know why once Layne breaks off Sludge Factory, leading to some humorous banter.  Once the band re-loads, Sludge Factory is executed to perfection; Layne compensates for his initial gaffe by singing with some added emotion.  The 5th song, Down In A Hole, was possibly the best performance of the set.  Just awesome.  They seem to hit their stride, and the rest of the show is almost a blur afterwards.  One great song after another, a 6-song succession of hits, culminating with their masterpiece, Would.  Would rivals Down In A Hole for best in the set; it's an extremely tough choice.  The 3 songs after Would seem a little anti-climactic (Frogs, Over Now, and Killer is Me, the last of which was new and surprisingly good).  <BR>We live in a time where it is en vogue to praise someone for giving 110 percent.  I've always been more of a proponent of &quot;hard work is for those short on talent&quot;; I'd say Alice would agree with the latter statement as well.  Save hyperbole for those rare times that it actually applies, such as this show, which undoubtedly deserves 6 stars out of 5.
B0000039QA|5.0|This album is in my opinion one of the top 3 hip hop albums ever made, along with Ready to die and All Eyez on me. It was a very different album than his debut classic Ready to die, because he now had to rap about haters and people bringing him down, since he saw fame and fortune. It really showed that there were more sides to Biggie than the crack life, and you can see him evolve since Ready to die, because he now shows the side of him pimpin, gettin it on with other men's girlfriends, but still lives the life in the comission, as seen in Ni@@as bleed. He also gave respect to the westcoast on the amazing song Going Back to Cali, and this I think was a silent tribute to 2Pac, although he doesnt mention his name once. It really showed how big hearted he was, and we as rap fans will always miss Big Poppa, more now with rappers like 50 Cent becoming platinum artists <BR>Anywayz, Life After Death is a classic that will be always in our hearts and CD players<BR>RIP the Notorious BIG aka BIG POPPA, the illest
B000002J0P|5.0|I hear everybody say that, &quot;CSN's debut album is nothing compared to Deja Vu&quot; That is complete and total bulls**t. This album, along with The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper, and Dylans Highway 61, is the pure definition of 60's culture. The polotics, the music, the harmonies, its all amazing. Some of the most incredible lyrics I've heard on any album, and i've heard most of Dylan, and Youngs stuff. Stand out tracks here are defeitly Suite:Judy Blue Eyes, Marrakesh Express, Guinnevere(or however you spell it) Pre Road Downs, Wooden Ships, Helplessly Hoping, and Long Time gone. Much like Deja VU, there are about 2 songs the album could do without like lady of the island, and 49 bye byes. And I really don't like You DOn't have to cry at all to tell you the truth. BUt get this album, you won't be let down.
B00004Z459|5.0|I would say that this is one of the best cd's out there on the market. I, personally, know every word yo every song on 'hybrid theory', 'meteora', and 'reanimation'.They're the best!!!
B000092Q4U|5.0|This is one of the best metal bands out there right now. They're leading the charge away from so-called nu-metal and into new ground. I guess it's not too surprising that most of the negative reviews have come from hatebreed and mudvayne fans, and the positive reviews have come from death and thrash metal fans, because this is heavier than anything on the radio that the sheeple have been exposed to. A lot of great stuff has been written already so I'll just say that Lamb of God and Shadows Fall are breaking new ground and making metal exciting to listen to again. Someone mentioned the lyrics, I wholeheartedly agree, the lyrics are incredible and deep and meaningful. Pure RAGE against our idiot government and corporate slavery, with a healthy dose of redneck (they are from Virginia after all).<br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND to any metal fan, especially those who like their metal HEAVY.
0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown's _The Da Vinci Code_ is essentially the Hershey's of brain candy: tastes sort of like the real thing, but is filled with a disturbing quantity of rat turds.  In essence, this is Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_ for stupid people.  If you thought Eco's book was too hard, and couldn't keep track of the references, and you didn't really get that the point was that maniacs will make connections between any two objects no matter how distant, and didn't understand that all the mad theories _are_ mad distortions of whatever historical data present themselves, then this book is for you.  Want to believe a load of old cobblers about the Holy Grail and goddesses?  Found _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ a little too taxing and academic for you?  This is this book you should read.  Don't worry, it won't be all that challenging, even for you, and anything that's too hard will be explained within two pages, so if you get stuck, there's always a crib sheet provided.  For the rest of us, that great punk album title had it best: Never mind the bollocks, here are the Sex Pistols.  And this book could indeed use a little Sid Vicious.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|Computer car stunts? Have we all forgotten the lessons of the 1970's, where a couple of good car wrecks could save an otherwise lousy movie?<BR>I'm being generous giving this 2 stars. John Singleton is horrible and should immedietly be deported to the former Soviet Union. <BR>Lame cars, action, lame everything. Go rent Hooper instead.
B0000DD7NL|3.0|On the second go round Alicia gives you more melody and grove and less instrumentation. This isnt a bad thing except for the fact that it leaves something missing that the first cd had. Something that I think helped to seperate her from the other artists out there now. Still this cd is a solid cd and manages to rise above the norm on a few cuts. On this cd she really keeps it retro and old school , however giving it the lyrical up-to-date feel of fresh lyrics. &quot;You dont know my name&quot; is easily one of the best tracks and makes me wonder why Kayne West didnt do more songs with her for this cd. (Hopefully he will make it more times around on the third) Her intro reminds me of the the one from the first while still keeping it somewhat fresh in delivery. As for the rest of the cd...whats good?:<br />*Heartburn<BR>*You dont know my name<BR>*If I aint got you<BR>*Diary<BR>*Wake up<BR>*Streets of New York<BR>*When you really Love someone<br />These tracks right here are the highlights of the album that I was feeling. With a Strong debut week of 618,000 copies sold she has no sophomore jinx here. Just off the strength of &quot;You dont know my name&quot; Im sure she could release a single. (if it inst released already) Overall I enjoyed the cd and thought it was a solid note for this time around. Hopefully next time around she can combine what she had on her last cd mixed with this to create Ultimate Alicia Keys but until then this will have to do.<br />Get it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Here is another show that FOX canceled! It's fate became that of most shows that Fox makes, it was canceled.<br />The Tick (Live action and cartoon versions) , Titus,  Family guy, Futurama, The Critic, Dark Angel, Grounded for life, Andy Richter controls the universe, John Doe,  just to name a few.  Fox has made and then canceled more popular TV shows then any other network that has ever, or will ever exist on this planet!<br />Firefly in my opinion is one of the best television shows ever made.  At first I was hesitant on watching it,  because I did not want to get into another show,  just to have it canceled by the morons at Fox! I gave it a chance though, and I really got into it!  The next thing that I knew , &quot;Oh look, it's canceled!&quot;, which is something that  I have said way to many times!<br />I don't think it was really given a full chance. Fox never played with the time slots, or moved it to a better day, they just canceled it.<br />This is a great show, and is well worth the money.
6305428042|5.0|This (For me)is the best movie of all time. I know it by heart and watch is at least once a day and I'm not tired of it. I've seen this movie well over 1000 times and I just love it.

B00005K3OT|1.0|I don't know about life in France 40 years ago, but there are some big misunderstandings in this film. There are at least 3 purposes to Lent. 1) As Mr. Virey points out, Lent is a spiritual workout. If I can say no today to something innocent like chocolate, perhaps tomorrow I can say no to something really evil. 2) Some people abstain from delicious treats everyday. Not because they want to, but because they have no choice. They are called poor people. If I can say no to self-indulgence today, perhaps the money I save can go to help someone who is really suffering. 3) Life &amp; everything in it is a free gift from God. If I can say no today to something good, perhaps I will remember that Providence &amp; that the world does not revolve around me &amp; &quot;I want&quot;.<BR>      I disliked this movie for several other reasons, most have been mentioned by other reviewers. I will mention one more. 60% of the population of the USA is overweight. Diabetes is almost epidemic. What if this film were called Tabac, &amp; was about smoking? Is it any different?
B00007FOMP|5.0|It seems that the questions and messages of this album have long overshadowed the quality of the music itself.  True, \\"What's Goin On?\\" is as pertinent question now as it was when this album was released, but there is nothing of significantly political proportion here.  This is the personal statement of a man who was a product of his time and his society. <BR>What this album stands on is the music, not the message.  Composed as an interweaving collection of songs sharing similar textures and melodic patterns, What's Goin On is a mesmerizing blend of jazz, R&B, soul, and pop music.  I would call this the soul version of the Beach Boys classic Pet Sounds, in the way it unveils as a work in the genre that far outshines it's contemporaries in terms of its grand scale.  To only listen to the words, one may be disappointed in cliches such as Save the Children, God is Love, etc.  But taken in the context of the soundscapes that surrounds the words, and the passion with which Marvin Gay delivers them, it all comes together to present the message with perfect clarity and dramatic effect.  <BR>This album is sweet and funky, introspective and sad, yet optimistic.  It is the result of a man struggling to create beauty and make sens of a world that seems increasingly harsh and difficult to live in.  Take time to engage in this classic, it is one of the essential statements of the 20th Century, it is an album that should be passed on through generations, races, classes, gender, and every other imaginary boundary that we hem ourselves in.  Open up and receive.
0385504209|5.0|&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is about a man and a woman who meet at a murder scene and stumble across one of the biggest secrets in history. It is the secret of the Holy Grail. Throughout the novel these two must solve puzzles and work together brilliantly to solve this riddle that comes to them. Along the way they must beat a group of religious men to the Holy Grail.<br />This book had many amazing aspects thrown in. One of these was the puzzles and riddles that were in it. At the beginning of the novel both characters must solve a series of riddles and puzzles. The whole book is filled with amazing puzzles that must be solved to unlock the secret of the Holy Grail. These puzzles stretch your brain with thought. Another amazing aspect was they way it was told. The chapters were all short. The point of view usually switched from character to character every chapter. This gave a great variety of the characters and the problems they go through. One last amazing part of the story was what was actually in the story. Some parts of the book must have taken immense research. There is no way that the average person could write this. Dan Brown is a Genius, Brown for President. There were no bad parts of this book.<br />In Conclusion I would recommend this book to almost anyone. Any age from 5th grade up could read this book. It is an amazing novel and I guarantee it will be one of the best books you ever read. If you are currently reading another book, stick a bookmark in it, put it on your dresser,  go get The Da Vinci Code, and begin reading. This book has priority over any book in the world right now.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is an assured adult statement by a very talented artist. Clearly Miss Keys has absorbed enough soul to be able to put it all out on this CD.

Clearly this soulful prodigy casts a seductive spell and lives up to its promise.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I first bought Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" when I was in the eighth grade.  I decided that I would broaden my horizons musical wise and \\"OK\\" seemed to be the best route.  Being an avid listener to bands like \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" and \\"Toadies\\", I longed for something different. Needless to say, Radiohead's album didn't do much for the first listen. I only knew songs that Mtv played like \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Karma Police\\". I would only play those songs then switch it to something else. It was when I began high school that I just popped the disc in one day and listened to the whole thing. After it was over I was overwhelmed with all sorts of emotions. I couldn't believe that I owned this album for over a year and never noticed it's astonishing beauty! Since then \\"OK Computer\\" has been easily the best album I have ever listened to. It has changed my musical taste forever to bands and singer/songwriters like Tori Amos, The Dandy Warhols, PJ Harvey, Bjork, and Rufus Wainwright.

0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is essentially, as my title states, a new twist on an old legend. <BR>Bradley takes her ideal of feminism and places it in the book, with the world of Avalon being based around female dominance, and queens having heavy infulence over their respected kings.<BR>But in essense, the book keeps the historic story of King Arthur and adds modern twists that keep the plot fresh and sets new suprises around every corner. <br />The size of the book is somewhat daunting, as i saw it when i first got the book, but you soon ignore the size, and as you reach the end, you may even wish it were longer. The story pulls you in, detail is very high, letting your imagination roam and gives your mind a tool in which to pull you into the story, making you feel like you really are there. <BR>The story, save for the first hundred pages or so, never dies down, there's always conflict and it dosen't bore you to the point where you want to skip pages. Often I read over pages because a certain scene is so mind boggling or wild that I double-take and read it again. <br />My only dislike for the book was the prominance of religious speak, which I personally am not a fan about, but can understand it's place in the book, due to the time period. Bradley really did her homework although in this section, there's plenty of Christian vs Pagan arguments where the facts each character throws at another seem so real. I really give credit for her in-depth research of both the story of King Arthur and the religious aspects of that time period.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have Britney's 2nd and 3rd cd. The 2nd one was pretty good, but the 3rd one was pretty crappy.<BR>But WOW did she blow me away with this album.<BR>She has completely abandoned the teeny-bopper style of music in her previous albums. It's a style all her own. It's pop, but it's dance with some r&amp;b and some hip hop.<BR>Every song sounds distinct, and works extremely well.<BR>This could be a huge hit if she chooses the right singles. &quot;I Got That Boom Boom&quot; has got to be the next single cause I'm obsessed with it.
B0000C8AUO|4.0|This album has really grown on me. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think it's pretty solid throughout. I dig the George Harrison cover (&quot;Try Some Buy Some&quot;) and love the Jonathan Richman song (&quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;), which takes on a kind of frightening intensity. In fact one of the main reasons I am writing this review is to let people know that the version of &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; on the Repo Man soundtrack is NOT THE ORIGINAL!! The original can be found on Modern Lovers by Jonathan Richman &amp; the Modern Lovers - recently voted one of the 500 best albums of all time by Rolling Stone Magazine.<br />That said, if you like Bowie or just want to hear some fresh, creative songs beautifully produced - buy this album!
B00005JLIU|4.0|I'm happy to finally see TMM on DVD, but was disappointed at the lack of extras.  It would have been nice to include anecdotes from Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, et. al.  Also, a 5.1 remix would have been preferable over the Dolby Digital (2 channel surround) one.  Otherwise, no real complaints here; the remastering job is superb.  Recommended.
B000002LCI|4.0|I find it interesting that while Music for the Masses is such a landmark in DM's discography and touring career, it is at the same time the least listened to album of my collection.  Possibly because I wore out (along with the radio back in the day) listening to &quot;strangelove&quot; and its better version b-side &quot;nothing&quot; from the original single release, as well as the ballad &quot;little 15,&quot; which I can't even listen to now since I've heard the 'bogus brothers' boot mix that adds a funky beat to the track.  Couple that with better versions of remixes out there for &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot; and the later &quot;Route 66,&quot; and all I'm left with is perhaps the most important song, &quot;Never let me Down,&quot; which still holds strong today.<br />Perhaps my point is that if you plan to be a DM collector, this is an essential and important work to have, but perhaps more appreciated when it originally came out.  I think the Amazon staff writer Beth wrote the most accurate review.  I just wanted to share my thoughts since I find it funny how I still keep going back to &quot;Speak and Spell&quot; or forward to &quot;Songs of Faith &amp; Devotion.&quot;
0385504209|4.0|It has been a long time since I was able to become so drawn into a novel that I literally couldn't wait to find time to read the next stage of the plot. With Angels and Demons, I became obsessed with reading as fast as I could to get to the end. It is the same with DaVinci Code. The storyline is compelling and even though you may know the theory he is extrapolating upon, it still has a magnetic affect on you. Dan Brown writes in tiers; layers of plot that seem to reach their pinnacle, suddenly another dimension is added to it. He writes about DaVinci being a prankster, which history supports, but he also plays games and amusing pranks with the reader. The protagonist is named Robert Langdon, whereas the consultant he uses, who happens to be a leading cryptologist, is John Langdon. The name of the man murdered in the novel is the name of the man purported to have found the documents referred to in the book. (Not to give the plot away.) My only complaint is that the plot development seems redundant from his previous work, so he needs to develop the story in a more unique fashion next time. There are so many fascinating elements to the theme of this book that whatever your level of knowledge regarding the theories are, there is still something to think about or to learn. His approach makes you stop and think about what he is proposing as a theory and even after you have read it, you still find yourself thinking about it. For those readers that like to delve into the possibilities that are still unknown to us, Brown is the author that helps you explore them while providing a rich, fast-paced novel to sink your teeth into and keep you up at night. A must read!
B000007MVM|5.0|Ok, so it's more like disintigration on CD these days. Syd Barrett's first solo album is the work of a man completely falling apart. As the founder of Pink Floyd, Barrett ingested enough LSD to drive a medium sized country mad, and by 1968 and 1969 (when this album was recorded) his mental state was very schizophrenic. Even with these problematic mental disorders (or maybe becasue of), Barrett managed to create a classic.<br /><br />Following Barrett's dismissal from Pink Floyd in early 1968, the band's managers followed Barrett, assuming that the band could not survive without their creative light (oops). While time has obviously proved them wrong, they soon set Barrett to work with producer Malcomb Jones and the trippy combo The Soft Machine to create a pop album. Barrett's performances soon proved to be erratic and strange, and it was soon apparent that the music was not going to set the teen scene on fire. The sessions were shelved (although temporarily as many tracks are included on the album) and \\"Octopus\\" was unleashed as a single. It unsurprisingly did not go far.<br /><br />Cut forward a few months and former bandmate Roger Waters and Syd's own replacement David Gilmour wheel Barrett back into the studio for some more fun and games. These sessions were acoustically based, and allowed Barrett to do pretty much whatever he wanted to do, even if it was endlessly strange.<br /><br />The final album is a somewhat daunting listen, but quite phenomenal if you can get your mind into Syd's world, where things like rhythm are rather amorphous. \\"No Good Trying,\\" \\"No Man's Land,\\" \\"Octopus,\\" and \\"Late Night\\" are strange but amazing masterpieces of psychedelic rock. On the first two especially, the backing musicians sound like they're furiously trying to keep up with Syd (no good trying?) and the music is always on the verge of flying apart at the seams in a wonderful and interesting sort of way. \\"Terrapin,\\" \\"Dark Globe,\\" and \\"Golden Hair\\" are the more acoustic classics.<br /><br />Now I'm guilty of a bit of blasphemous resequencing in regards to my own copy of \\"The Madcap Laughs.\\" I've taken out \\"Feel\\" and \\"If It's In You,\\" which I think qualify as acoustic shambles, and replace them with \\"Opel\\" and \\"Silas Lang.\\" These are outtakes from the Malcomb Jones sessions that I think are amazing (especially \\"Opel\\") and bewilderingly left off the album. They can be found on the otherwise hit or miss odds-and-sods complation \\"Opel.\\"<br /><br />Although more expensive, I heartily recommend the EMI reissue of this disc. The remastering is far superior to Capitol's disc, and the alternate takes are illuminating. Barrett never played a song the same way twice; that was likely part of his madness. Better yet, get all of Barrett's remastered studio legacy in the \\"Shine On Crazy Diamond\\" box set (which may be a bit difficult as I think it's out of print).bit of blasphemous resequencing in regards to my own copy of \\"The Madcap Laughs.\\" I've taken out \\"Feel\\" and \\"If It's In You,\\" which I think qualify as acoustic shambles, and replace them with \\"Opel\\" and \\"Silas Lang.\\" These are outtakes from the Malcomb Jones sessions that I think are amazing (especially \\"Opel\\") and bewilderingly left off the album.

B0000C7PRY|5.0|Absolutely brilliant.  This changed me. I saw him perform this w/ Portnoy + a bunch of hired musicians and it was by far the best show I have ever seen. So much complexity yet so much melody and emotion. It does not get better than this.  This is about Neal, not some lame made up character called &quot;snow&quot;  who I don't care about.  This is Neal's story so if you bag on the lyrics, you ar bagging on Neal.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The best singers are not necessarily those who sing the loudest, can belt the highest notes, or have crystal pure clarity. You can have a voice like Barbara Streisand which is crystal pure, wide-ranged, and almost perfect. However, if you can't make people feel the emotions in the music, then you are not a singer. A perfect voice is not always a human voice...and to make people feel you need to be a creature of humanity and vulnerability.<br />Some of the world's greatest singers did not have the widest ranges, the clearest tones, or even belted at all. Britney Spears, for all we know, may be in the tradition of the great Julie London (who once said her voice was no more than a thimbleful), the affecting voice of Peggy Lee, or even Rosemary Clooney (who rarely had great clarity).  Cher, Madonna, and Christina - who all have differing vocal abilities - have one thing in common. Their voices can convey true emotion.  Their ability to make audiences feel their music is what has sustained their careers.  The same can be said for Britney. If nothing else, her voice is an unforgettable instrument. We long for it more and more, because when we hear Britney we are hearing a real person and not simply a singing machine...or a voice that is so perfect that it sounds like it has never experienced the sorrows of life (Clay Aiken, anyone? Barbra Streisand?). When people call Britney fake, I always wonder how they can praise voices of unreal perfection?<br />A person may have a great voice, but that does not make them a true singer. Anyone who has heard some of Britney's ballads, such as \\"Everytime\\" or \\"Sometimes\\" knows she has the potential to be a singer. Until then, enjoy the entertainment and fun that Britney's music stands for. She has rarely been a serious artist..but an artist who has created something fun.  That is what she is best at. We can't be depressed by deep artists like Tori Amos and Coldplay all the time. We need fun music to lighten us up and provide some kind of balance to our lives. Britney's new album, In The Zone, is perfect for times when you want to feel sexy, content with your life, and maybe even smile. Who else but Britney Spears could convey to us those emotions?
B00003CXAY|5.0|This film is one of few that has used this form of media to it's full potential.  The combination of images and music presented in a fashion that allows the view to extrapolate meaning (rather than have meaning thrust upon them) is both refreshing and thought-provoking.  This trilogy is a true artistic masterpiece.
B000002H2H|1.0|No doubt I like Metallica.  But they got off to a really bumpy start with underachieving albums like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Ride the Lighning.&quot;  While they went on to make overrated albums like &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; and the Black album, they never really made a good album until &quot;Load/Reload&quot; and &quot;St. Anger,&quot; which are the BEST Metallica albums ever.  &quot;Right the Lightning&quot; isn't the worst album ever made, but it totally pales in comparison to &quot;St. Anger.&quot;
B00005OWEG|2.0|This film appeard to me that it was just written by a person that did not like Viet Nam and just wanted to make it look as bad as possible.  As they travel down the river there is one chance after another to do that.   Most of it I just found wierd.  The acting and screenplay was absolutely superb but nonetheless I just did not connect with anyone in the film.  Sorry to those die-hard that find this movie one of the greatest ever.
B00009V7RF|1.0|This album was a total disappointment.  There is hardly a message to be heard over &quot;sell out&quot;! &quot;sell out&quot;!.  Yay.  They have commercials now.  woo woo.  Their voice and lyrics say nothing anymore, except maybe &quot;we're bored&quot;.  I didn't think any of their songs would grow on me, partly because they sound like they are trying to make money.  Well, they got my chump change, but probably for the last time.
0385508417|5.0|The numerous reviews already posted for this delightful book by John Grisham clearly obviate the need for me to weigh in with my comments. Nevertheless, I have decided that there is such a wide diversity of opinion that I might as well add my voice to the mix and hopefully provide a slightly different perspective that perhaps might be of value to a potential purchaser. Several summary points - first, this is not at all a typical Grisham book, it is more a novella than a novel and a satire/ comedy that expands the range of his accomplishments as a writer. (In the latter regard but not in tone it is similar to BLEACHERS - see review of  10/6/03.) Second, while it is very engaging and there are certainly some moments of tension, it is light and easy reading - only 177 pocket book sized packages. Third, it encompasses a wide range of emotions but is a feel good story exploring the meaning of Christmas, the complexity of our interpersonal relationships and the unexpected twists of fate. Last, some aspect of the story will undoubtedly provoke a spark of recognition in most readers regarding some similar incident in their own lives.<br />The plot is simplicity itself -  Thanksgiving weekend Blair Krank waves goodbye to her parents (Luther and Nora) and boards a plane to begin her service as a Peace Corps volunteer in Peru.  Nora is consumed with worry about her daughter's safety, and Luther soon realizes that the family's Christmas routine of the past twenty-three years has now been completely altered. Being an accountant, Luther soon performs a cost/benefit analysis and reaches the conclusion that the costs of Christmas (financial combined with the psychological and physical stress) outweigh the benefits, especially given Blair's absence. Therefore, he plots how to convince Nora that they should consider SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and enjoy a holiday cruise instead. While she is initially resistant, they eventually agree and plan to avoid the usual Christmas routine (parties, gifts, decorations, etc.) and instead prepare for their holiday respite.<br />However, Luther soon finds that he has forgotten the other side of the ledger and there are hidden costs to forgoing their Christmas celebration and some overlooked benefits of the usual routine. While a few of Luther's associates are supportive and he suspects many more are secretly envious, Nora's friends view their decision with suspicion and she remains very ambivalent about their plans. Also, they become neighborhood outcasts as their yard remains devoid of decorations and (as depicted on the bookjacket) their rooftop alone on Hemlock Street remains without Frosty the Snowman to celebrate the season. And just when it seems they have successfully overcome all hurdles and their departure is within sight, as is often the case fate takes one last unexpected twist.<br />Any doubts about the tone and message of this book should be dispelled at the very beginning; after all, who except a Krank would decide not to celebrate Christmas? And yet, there is undoubtedly some aspect of the decision to which every reader can relate. And the ending was close to perfect, with the outcome reflecting the human condition and our relationships very poignantly. The final two brief sentences captured the ambivalence of the book extremely well. The book can be read during a plane or train trip or while relaxing during a winter evening, and its cleverness and Grisham's ability to perfectly capture the essence of the character types involved caused me to round up my rating to five stars despite its brevity and its lack of any true surprises.<br />As an aside, I also recommend David Baldacci's THE CHRISTMAS TRAIN (review 11/20/02) as another out-of-type story by another well known author for any readers who want a delightful and uplifting Christmas story with a somewhat more complex plot and less predictable storyline.<br />Tucker Andersents, decorations, etc.) and instead prepare for their holiday respite. <br />However, Luther soon finds that he has forgotten the other side of the ledger and there are hidden costs to forgoing their Christmas celebration and some overlooked benefits of the usual routine.

B000002UAO|5.0|This is arguably the best album the Beatles ever created, the Rolling Stone rankings notwithstanding.  This album is pure rock mastery.<br />Rubber Soul is a mind-bending genre twister, with nary a weak moment throughout.  John is at his finest with excellent songs like &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;In My Life,&quot; and Paul shines on &quot;Drive My Car&quot; with an edgy bit of innuendo and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; as an amazing break-up tune.  George contributes two of his finest pieces to date (though &quot;I Need You&quot; on Help! was wonderful as well) and Ringo co-writes on &quot;What Goes On,&quot; which is an excellent tune despite it's oft-maligned image.<br />That Rubber Soul was the first indispensably great Beatles album is what makes it worth owning, but there are many fans, including this one, that would name it the Beatles best.  Ever.<br />Please don't miss this album.  What a wonderful journey it is.
0156027321|5.0|This is a very intelligent book. It asks all the right questions and provides glimpses of various answers but leaves it to the reader to make his/her own conclusions (if there are any). <BR>Most areas of the book are preposterous but it only adds to the experience and highlight the futility of the human condition. I can't wait to read this book again!<BR>Usually, the only books I read in one sitting are trash novels but this was a pleasant exception. I could not put this down once I started reading it. Buy and read this again and again....
0385504209|2.0|The story was interesting and it was definitely and quick beach read but Brown's style of writing detracted from the strength of the book
B00000JGOJ|5.0|Witty and very entertaining! I didn't even know this movie existed and it certainly looked like a 'chic flick'. Well, this will certainly be a hit with the ladies but I found the movie to be very good. It could be due to the fact that I watched this right after 'TimeCop 2', so the comparison could be playing in its favor.<BR>Anyways, I highly recommended it.
B00005JKN9|2.0|Too Long... too dark.... cinematography too \\"artificial\\" looking....characters were generally  unlikeable....DayLewis over acts... my opinion, movie highly over rated.
0385504209|4.0|An entertaining read. I bought it as a friend had recommended it and it was also ranked No. 1 at Amazon.<br />The author tries and does a good job to popularize the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. There are some very entertaining passages in the book when he discusses the mortality of Jesus and how the Church came about. The book also goes into various tangents that are intelligent but not related to the subject. Well, my brain can only take so much useless information.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Frida is a haunting character and the movie has  scenes and characters that  keep coming back to you long after you've seen it.  I am completely taken with Julie Taymore after seeing her interviews with Bill Moyer and the AFI on the DVD's Features segments.  Totally fascinating hearing her describe  her vision of Frida and how she  made the movie of her life.  Supporting cast is excellant also....very believable and memorable.
B00005JM02|1.0|I missed this movie whilst it was in theaters, so i was bummed... my brother, grandma, aunts, uncles, etc. all saw it and said it was great... <br />So when this came out on DVD I was excited to see it, i grabbed it as soom as we got home, went up to my room, put it im my Pc and was ready for the &quot;magic&quot;<br />20 minutes later, i was sleeping...<br />for about a week I bragged that it &quot;put me to sleep&quot; since I was the only one I knew who had fallen asleep, but to be fair, i watched it again... it was horrible...<br />There is nothing funny about this movie at all, it is neither &quot;funny&quot;, &quot;Heartwarming&quot;, or anything else the reviews and my family said...<br />Also, there was alot of stuff they could have done that they didn't, like Nemo's fin, all they really used his broken fin for is symbolysm to never give up, while they could have had some jokes about it or something<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not a disney hater who hates everything they churn out, though i don't really like disney, i do have some favorites, Aladin, POTC, and others ring a bell...<br />I also loved the other DIsney/Pixar collaborations, Toy Story is STILL funny after 10 years, A Bug's Life still makes me laugh, Toy Story 2 is pretty cool, and Monsters Inc. is ok.<br />But, here is one of the problems, Pixar needed advertising when it came out because nobody knew who they were, who would see anything by a company nobody has every heard of?<br />Disney ended up loving the idea for Toy Story and decided to distribute it, this would make big bucks for Disney who hadn't actually made a good movie since Aladin (in my oppinion) since then, and needed a good one, and Pixar would get money in return because, hey, its a Disney movie.<br />Pixar became a household name and as of now is actually considering going on their own, and they can... because they are popular and good enough. But, Disney is holding on to them for everything because thats all they have, their animated movies are pulling in little to none.<br />but, back to Nemo, the fish are all one-dimentional and every joke in this movie is just another Clishe, unlike other Pixar movies which had new ideas, who had, up intil now, heard of talking toys, Bugs, or monsters that scare for a &quot;living&quot;?<br />But, now we are back to talking animals something that Disney has (sarcasm) NEVER DONE BEFORE! (end sarcasm)<br />I have a feeling that Pixar, in light of the whole &quot;wanting to break away from Disney&quot; thing, decided to make a sucky movie so Disney wouldnt want them anymore, but sadly it backfired, and has become Disney's most succesful movie ever...<br />You can see that Pixar is trying to be funny, but disneys restrictions prevent that....<br />Now, you don't have to be discusting to be funny, but you can tell Disney really wanted the G rating<br />Now, something good that came out of this is that now, Pixar can't possible make anything worse than this, so the next one will probably be good...

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain is a beautiful and talented women who believes in herself and her ability. This DVD shows us all just how talented a women she is. The songs are great ones from the past and absolute blow outs for new songs. You add that with the beauty she has and her caring for her fans and you have the best female singer there is. This DVD is great and one for the books and your DVD collection

B0000TB03W|5.0|If you never experienced a Shania concert this will give you a great introduction to it. Shania sings a good variety of her old songs and her new. Shania's energy level is astounding. There are plenty of fan shots so if you where there you'll probably see yourself. The pyro-techs are good. The band clearly enjoy themselves as does the audience. The editing could have been better. But to a Shania fan it's a fantastic gift.

0060254920|5.0|I found it interesting to see how others interpret the message/moral of the tale.  I think there are several messages in the story worth considering.  First, there is the whole idea that Max's acting wild at home and being called \\"monster\\" leads him to fantasize of going to a world where he is the master of all monsters (as opposed to at home where he is being told to go to his room).  In essence the story is showing how imaginative play is a healthy reflection of one's desires (\\"You think I'm a monster?  Then, I'll go and be king of the monsters.\\").  Second, the statement \\"I'll eat you up\\" that Max states to his mother when angry, is also what the monsters say to him.  Except when the monsters say it, it's \\"We'll eat you up, we love you so.\\"  In essence, Max's desire to eat up his mother is a loving and agressive desire to be with Mommy.  Third, is the loving resolution at the end.  When Max makes it back home, his meal is waiting for him.  In essence, all is forgiven.  Families can handle when children act out.  There is love that carries across these situations.  All of these themes are nicely incorporated into the story such that it doesn't really hit you at a direct level, but it works nonetheless.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am in love with this band.  The lyrics tear at your heart, the music lifts you up and pulls you down, together they take you away to another place.  It's magical.  Amy is so talented, and has the most beautiful voice, and Ben writes the most poignant lyrics, and together it's absolute magic.  Get this CD, you won't regret it.

Other favorites are: <BR>  *So simple<BR>  *If I ain't got you <BR>  *Karma <BR>  *Diary<BR>  *Dragon Days<BR>But none-the-less I like all the tracks, and unlike other cd's, this one you can put in your cd player/stereo cd player and let it play all the way through, a must buy cd. <BR>Other must buys: Chingy &quot;jackpot&quot;,  DMX &quot;grand champ&quot;,  Jay-z &quot;black album&quot;
0345451325|3.0|Eric Nylund is very quickly filtering up the list of my favorite Sci Fi authors.  Here in the Fall of Reach we see another virtuoso performance by a master of the Sci Fi genre.  I was unable to give this book five stars because I felt Nylund was somewhat constricted by the Halo franchise.  If you have read the Signal to Noise series you know how much Eric strains himself to hold back on truly deep exploration of the Cortana figure.  Her whole character is RIPE for development by an author like Nylund.<br />As a warning there is not as much space battle in this book as the first one in the series.  It is mostly a Master Chief POV/special ops perspective.  I don't think that is where Nylund would have gone naturally.<br />I gave the book only three stars because I think Nylund was forced to write &quot;inside the box&quot;.  However he did a MUCH better job than did Dietz (that man should have all his writing tools confiscated).
630469654X|4.0|Synopsis:<br />Ladyhawke follows Phillipe Gaston (Matthew Broderick), a petty thief in Medieval Europe known as \\"the Mouse.\\"  Soon after escape the dungeons of Aquila and the hangman's noose, he accidentally becomes entwined with the quest a pair of star-crossed lovers Attiene Navarre and Lady Isabeau (Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfiefer) to break themselves of a curse put on them by the corrupt and evil bishop of Aquila (John Wood).<br />About the Movie<br />Ladyhawke stands as one of my favorite movies. I tend to go towards fantasy as a matter of course, but this movie has strong 'chick-flick' elements in it.<br />But I don't care. Matthew Broderick is delightful and a little silly as 'the Mouse,' showing in this film, exactly why he's endured as an actor for all these years. Rutger Hauer, an actor I've always liked, did a great job as well. His portrayal of the cursed and grieving Navarre is believable in its intensity.  And of course, Michelle Pfiefer, while not a scene stealer, certainly is nice to watch.<br />The story itself is the classic tale of star-crossed lovers (right down to the enchantment that keeps them apart), but unlike Shakespeare's classic play, the lovers get to have each other in the end. This is a true epic fantasy, with a good many original elements.<br />The first thing most people mention when they see this movie is that the musical score is out of place. I have to admit that that analysis is right on. The musical scoring for this movie was done by 80's band &quot;The Alan Parsons Project.&quot; While generally, I have liked their music, the disco-pop electronica that runs through a good portion of the movie and many of the action scenes is out of place and poorly chosen. In 1985, this was cutting edge stuff, but now nearly 20 years later, it is hopelessly dated and out of place for a pure medieval fantasy film. Fantasy movies should have a fantasy score.<br />It would be wonderful if a director's cut were released with a revamped musical score. Such a project would turn what is at this point a very fine movie (with hokey music) into a stronger and better lasting film.<br />But for all the downsides of the musical score, it's the story itself that steals the show. There's something attractive and heartwarming about it and its characters. As a result, they hold your attention easily and through them, the grand finale truly manages to make the viewer grin with satisfaction.<br />About the DVD:<br />This DVD release of Ladyhawke is nothing special as far as DVD releases go.  It comes on a double sided DVD in both Letterbox and Fullscreen versions in a cardboard snap case.  The movie is translated into French and Spanish, and comes with English, French, and Spanish subtitles. There are a few bonus features as well, but all of the textual variety. More on that below.<br />The video quality of this DVD is not much better than you'd find on a video cassette; something that's somewhat disappointing given the DVD format's high capacity for quality images.  The heavy film grain that showed up in some scenes is not something I like to see on DVD. It's a real shame, because the lack of quality really shows on a high resolution screens. Likewise, the sound is about average as well.<br />This DVD does have a few bonus features that come in the format of a few screens of trivia about the making of the film and various aspects of the cast and production.  All are interesting reading but aren't anything more than interesting trivia.  The only actual video portion of the bonus features is the orginal theatrical trailer for the movie.<br />Bottom line here is that this is a mediocre DVD release.  The bad film transfer really is noticable on high-res screens, and there really isn't much in terms of extra features and material. I give it 4 stars.

6305499365|5.0|If you've read most of my reviews, lists, and \\"So-You'd-Like-To\\" things,, you know that i REALLY, REAAALLLY like this movie... yes sir, this is my FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! If you've never seen it and you're wondering what my hype towards it is all about, let me give you a little tour of the plot:<br />Peter Gibbins is an I would assume around the age of 25 year-old office worker who couldn't possibly hate his job more than he hates it now... From the traffic jam in the morning where an old man in a walker makes better forward progress than him, to getting a shock when he touches the door to walk in, to listening to that fat red-haired lady say \\"JUUUST A MOOMMEEENNNT\\" non-stop, and of course, hearing those 4 favorite words of his: \\"Hello Peter,, what's happening?\\" from his boss, Bill Lumbergh, played hillariously by Gary Cole, and of course there's also that printer that always says \\"Paper jam\\" when there IS no paper jam. Then one day, Peter realizes that \\"humans were not meant to spend their short lives sitting in a cubicle staring at computer screens all day, listening to 8 different bosses moan on about mission statements\\", and just decides, \\"I'm not gonna go anymore\\", and it all goes downhill from there....... (That's all I'll tell, dont wanna ruin it :)<br />Other great characters include his 2 friends/coworkers, Michael Bolton (just a coincidence, no relation)- a computer nerd who loves rap music and states that \\"I shouldn't change my name, HE'S the one who sucks!\\", and Samir, an Arabian who really doesn't like that printer..., and then of course there's the great Milton Waddams, who just wants his stapler back, his paycheck, not to move his desk again, and a piece of cake.. and Tom Smikowski, the old guy who constantly worries about getting laid off, and Drew, the young laid-back guy who just wants to show a girl his OHH face (the \\"HOW LUMBERGH F*CKED HER\\" thing cracks me up every time :)  But of course my favorite character would probably be Peter's next door neighbor Lawrence, who just wants Peter to \\"Check out channel 9!\\" <br />This will be a comedy you will easily love and relate to if you have a job or class you really don't like to get up every morning to go to.. trust me, I'VE had plenty of em....<br />This movie also has some great tunes to go with it- \\"I Got This Killer Up Inside of Me\\", the song that Michael sings in his car in the morning, that is until a black guy walks by... \\"Die Motherf*ckers Die\\", the ultimate printer-smashing song, \\"Damn It Feels Good to Be A Gangster\\", the perfect \\"I-don't-care-and-I-feel-great-about-it\\" song, and of course, the \\"Take This Job and Shove It(I Aint Workin Here No More)\\" song played in the end credits is priceless...<br />If you want a good comedy, you WILL NOT be dissapointed AT ALL! Trust me, this movie has lines that you will leave as quotes for your AIM away messages for years and years to come :)<br />You can go watch that 'Lizzie McGuire' movie if you want, but,,<BR>in conclusion, I have 6 final words: TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT!!!!!!<br />GREATEST<br />MOVIE<br />EVER :)
B00005JM02|5.0|Easily the most enjoyable and beautifully crafted computer-animated movie made to date - bar none.  It represents a refreshing and much-needed return to form (read: Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y) for Disney Pictures.  Chances are you've already heard about this film or know someone who has seen it.  Now that I've seen the DVD, it's easy to see what all the buzz was about.  The plot provides the film title:  Marlin, a father clown fish on the Australian Great Barrier Reef, has been separated from his son Nemo, who has been netted and suddenly transplanted to a Sydney dentist's aquarium.  Thus follows Marlin's epic journey to find and reunite with the youngster.  Along the way we are treated to a virtual feast of visual sensory overload of colorful scenes, exciting adventures and a host of hilariously unique sea creatures that permanently endear themselves to you whether you like it or not.  Anyone with a heartbeat will love this movie.  A slam-dunk, unqualified recommendation for all ages.
B00009V7T2|3.0|Is this a good album?  Sure.  Brilliant?  No.  I really wanted to like this album, since just about everyone in the world is singing its praises.  Yet, every time I try to give it another chance, the same thing inevitably happens: I start out thinking, &quot;Hey, this is pretty damn good after all,&quot; but by the time the fifth or sixth song rolls around, the album has completely lost my attention.<br />Why is that?  Well, there's no denying that The Mars Volta are very talented musicians.  The problem is, their talent can make the songs interesting, but it doesn't necessarily make them GOOD.  In most cases, the songs meander pointlessly - this isn't complexity for the sake of enhancing the emotion of the album, it's complexity just for the sake of complexity.  Do we really need the drawn out interlude of near-silence on &quot;Cicatriz ESP,&quot; for example?  No way.  It's really rather frustrating, because most of these songs are quite good, until they totally lose their focus.<br />The lyrics are a major problem as well.  Yeah, we've all heard about it: this is a concept album about the suicide of a friend.  But I seriously doubt that anyone can honestly claim they'd glean such a meaning from the lyrics, if they hadn't been told about it beforehand.  As a matter fact, I don't think it would be possible to glean ANY meaning from the lyrics, without being informed of what they're supposed to be.  I'm sure it all makes sense to the band, but if you ask me, a lyricist has failed if his lyrics don't convey something to the audience.  And to me, all this album is conveying is a big sense of pride in its own vocabulary.  Hey, check it out, I just wrote a Mars Volta line: &quot;Corporeal earth stained by tempestuous tears of a tourniquet-tied mind.&quot;  Rock on!<br />Okay, maybe I'm being unnecessarily negative here.  I have to admit, I love &quot;Inertiatic ESP,&quot; as well as its &quot;Son Et Lumiere&quot; intro.  &quot;Televators&quot; is quite good as well.  And like I said, most of the other songs have their moments too, before they get distracted by their desire to be &quot;prog rock.&quot;  Ultimately, it's still a good album - it's just nowhere near being worth all the hype it has.
0393038912|4.0|This book tries to explain why the world has come to be dominated by western cultures coming out of Europe.  Thankfullly, the reason is not due to racial or genetic sueriority, as some experts have claimed in the past.  In fact, according to Diamond, the reason beginins in the prehistory of humans.  The most important factors are the physical environment and the availability of easily domesticated plants and animals.  Also, Eurasian cultures benefited from an East-West axis, which promoted the spread of agriculture and crops, while other continents suffered from a North-South axis which retarded the spread of crops.  Those cultures which had access to these crops and a good environment to grow them in could increase their food production and population which in turn led to the development of government, writing, and technology.<br />Jared Diamond's background as an evolutionary biologist helps him to see the big picture. He's able to back away from the small details of history which often mislead other researchers.  I'm particularly interested in his idea that opportunity, not race or culture, was the prime derterminant in the rise of western culture.  My only complaint is that at times it seems that Diamond is repeating himself.  Perhaps if the editing had been a little tighter, he could have cut this book by about 25 to 30 pages.  Anyway, it's just a small complaint.  Overall this is an excellent book with some great ideas.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain is a beautiful and talented women who believes in herself and her ability. This DVD shows us all just how talented a women she is. The songs are great ones from the past and absolute blow outs for new songs. You add that with the beauty she has and her caring for her fans and you have the best female singer there is. This DVD is great and one for the books and your DVD collection.

B00008IHN1|5.0|I loved this movie.  Everything about it was great!!! I am a lover of music and a former high school band student and at that time not much meant more to me than being in the marching band, so I really enjoyed it. All of the actors were good. And Nick Cannon was so cute!!! He's also a great actor.  Congrats to the people behind the storyline. This movie definitely deserves a 5-star rating. By the way, very clear picture. It's like you're really there!!!!!

0061015725|2.0|......1 part writing.  Crichton has been my favorite author ever since Andromeda.  Sphere, Rising Sun, Disclosure - all brilliant.  He started losing me with Lost World, which was Disney-kid fluff.  In this one, his science extrapolation is excellent and classic Crichton.  However, the writing was dreadful.  &quot;I did this, then I did that.&quot;  Some authors use first person as a crutch; here it is a fully powered wheelchair.  I lost track of how many times Jack tells us there is no way out and he'll be dead in seconds.  And he tells us this so matter-of-factly that you expect Jerry Seinfeld to show up and say, &quot;Ah, that's a shame.&quot;  And what do writers do when they can't portray the intended angst?  They use exclamation points; ug.  The characters are painfully stock, and the dialogue is B-movie.  The most dynamic relationship is clearly between Jack and Julia, but the lack of pre-crisis Julia character development made me not care about the denouement.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Frida (Julie Taymor, 2002)<br />Within the first few seconds of Frida's opening, it's obvious to anyone who's seen Titus that this is a Julie Taymor film. I've never seen that particular shade of blue anywhere but on Tony Hopkins' face.<br />Frida opens riskily. The first part of the film is, not to put too fine a point on it, boring as all get-out. However, somewhere in the midst of all the boredom, Taymor is seducing the viewer, and by the time you get to the movie's first unforgettably surreal image (after the trolley accident, with Salma Hayek covered in blood and powdered gold), you're hooked for the rest of the movie. And not just because Ms. Hayek spends so much of it unclothed, either (finally fulfilling a collective male fantasy in existence since From Dusk Till Dawn).<br />Hayek plays Frida Kahlo, husband Diego Rivera is played by Alfred Molina (recently on the big screen in Identity), and the movie centers around the two's volatile marriage. Rivera seems incapable of being faithful, which drives Kahlo's art deeper into the subconscious depths of pain and misery her art achieved. And yet still, somehow, the two of them love one another enough to keep trying to make it work, over and over again. Well, at least it made for great art.<br />The movie is also powered by a number of fine cameos, from Edward Norton to Antonio Banderas to Geoffrey Rush to Saffron Burrows and a whole lot of places in between. Add the trademark dadaesque scenes one expects from Taymor, and the film ends up being quite fine. Certainly worth a screening. *** ½
B0000TB03W|5.0|After a brief hiatus of creating a family and working on new songs with her ellusive husband, Mutt, Shania has come back strong,both vocally and lyrically. And she hasn't skimped on the entertainment factor either. In fact, Shania seems to be almost basking in her newfound live show lights on this DVD, titled, UP! Respectively so titled UP! with it's upbeat attitude it certainly reflects on the listener/viewer as well. Watch and your attitude will be uplifted too. Enjoy!!

Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was captivated by the storyline, the music, the acting, and the scenery.  <br />This is one of my top FIVE movies for 2003.  Heck, it might be my top movie because I can't remember the other four movies.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is an amazing novel. The book begins with Robert Langdon, a Harvard symologist, in his hotel room in Paris. In the middle of the night a detective comes to his hotel room and takes him to the Louvre, where a Louvre curator has been murdered. When Langdon arrives at the Louvre he find the dead mans body and a baffling cipher around the body. Langdon and cryptologist, Sophie Neveu have to decipher the code. Langdon soon finds out that the dead curator was part of the Priory of Sion-a real secret society that included such people as Da Vinci, Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, and Victor Hugo. Langdon suspects that they are on a hunt for the most sought after article ever. During a race around Paris, all odds seem against the two. They are also facing against a faceless powerbroker that follows and knows their every move. They must find the article or else the truth and power of it may be lost forever.<br /> I loved the novel The Da Vinci Code. I thought it was an extremely exciting and interesting book that kept me on my toes throughout the book. The beginning of the book might seem boring, but after the first 60 pages or so the book becomes an amazing novel. The twists in the book lead you through it on the edge of your seat. The twists may seem to be big parts of the book that completely change around the whole ideal of the book, but the end shocked me completely. The only thing bad I can write about this book is that it had a slow beginning, besides that the book was truly amazing.<br /> I would strongly recommend reading this book. It is a book that everyone can enjoy and have fun with.
B0000TB03W|5.0|We all were glad to hear Shania was coming back but what we did not expect was the biggest loudest bang one could hear when she came back. Shania caught us all unaware I think with the quailty of this DVD. The sharpness and clear full voice to the beauty of Shania is all on this DVD. It is a DVD that we all need to have in our collection if we call ourselves Shania fans. She has come back and at least I say Welcome back and thanks for such a great DVD with the best music I have heard in sometime.
B0000E6XH3|3.0|And really a fan is what you have to be to really enjoy it. As you may or may not already know, the DVD is an extension on four previously released music videos for tracks on Daft Punk's Discovery album. Now the entire album has been animated and tells a more fleshed out and complete story, which has twists and turns and moreover a respectable ending.<br />There is no dialogue in the entire presentation except in the opening credits, where Matsumoto talks about his dreams. Sound effects have been added in certain parts, and are unobtrusive to the music.<br />But it's due to this lack of dialogue that the story itself is very boring. Not to say that the visuals are boring themselves - quite the contrary; the artwork is beautiful - but they rarely succeed in exposing the characters' personalities. A group of extragalactic musicians are one day captured by unknown forces and returned to Earth, where an evil producer turns them into the world's most popular band. They are pursued by the female band member's shy lover, who sets about freeing the band from the producer's clutches and winning the female lead's heart.<br />The transfer quality is great, however the audio is somewhat subdued. Fortunately you can enjoy the DVD in a variety of audio formats, including 5.1 surround sound.<br />The extras are confusing to navigate, however. The menu is represented by a series of undetailed buttons with no explanation as to their purpose. But the extras are generally uninformative and unimpressive, especially the character profiles. There's also karaoke, if you're into that.<br />But given the limited appeal of the music itself, alongside the subpar story, the DVD really has little to offer to non Daft Punk fans and even anime fans in general. But to those who have spent the last few years wondering how it all ends, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo looked like a cute movie for kids, but it turned out to be a movie for all ages. Even if you had gone into the movie with the attitude of, &quot;I'm gonna hate this.&quot;, you would walk out saying, &quot;Wow, that was great!!&quot; There was at least one character that everyone could relate to. If you are a little forgetful, you could relate to Dory. If you are a worry wart, you can relate to Marlin. It is an all around good movie. Not to mention the preview for, The Incredibles, was great.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|While history cannot be ignored, it's possible for new approaches to be accepted.  Let It Be Naked isn't exactly as claimed, but it's more than close enough to satisfy.  Do the songs work? Does it rock?  Most definitely.  While a few songs are less than their best, they are still enjoyable.  Several are classics. Any album that features Get Back, Dig A Pony, Long And Winding Road, Two Of Us, I've Got A Feeling, Don't Let Me Down, Across The Universe, and Let It Be should not be dismissed.  Although For You Blue isn't quite at that level, it's more intimate, and more fun than in previous releases.  The album succeeds because it combines great sonics and polish with the informalness of the original sessions. I have been a Beatle fan for 36 years. I have Thirty Days, a sessions box set, and both Get Back cds. I've read many accounts, and seen many histories. I love the chat between songs, but I don't miss it here.  LIBN puts the emphasis where it belongs, on the music. There's much to love on Get Back.  I've owned it in one form or another for 20 years, but it's a little TOO naked. You can hear energy, but you can also hear laziness.  Let It Be is great as it is, but it doesn't have the continuity and coherence that LIBN has. I'm no Phil Spector basher, I thought he did a fine job.  Most of the songs work very well on their own, but roughness doesn't fit too comfortably alongside the embellished tunes.  The Beatles seem like guests on their own album.  On LIBN, you hear a band at work.  There's a warmth to it, and it still maintains the spirit of the original sessions.  When the music is this great, I don't care about what the production team did, but to those who will fuss, the Beatles ditched the no overdubs approach before Spector.  LIBN actually makes good on the blurb that was on the Let It Be album.  The original isn't going anywhere.  It's still there in the shops, and all of the single versions of Get Back, Don't Let Me Down, and Let It Be are still available.As fun as it is, Dig It isn't really a song. I can take or leave Maggie Mae.    Alternate versions of those two are on Fly On The Wall.  LIBN sounds like the link between the White Album and Abbey Road.  It's a great album.

B00009TB5G|5.0|After seeing FOTR, I highly anticipated the release of Two Towers.  While I thought the theatrical version was excellent, the extended version is FAR superior, not just drawn out scenes, etc...While attention to visual and audio detail was nearly flawless in this movie, there were a couple things I thought unneccessary.  Aragorn presumed dead is one change that was totally unneccessary because it did not add anything to the story.  Other changes like the differece in Faromir's character are, in my  opinion, well justified and plausable in the extended edition.  One thing I liked less about TT than Fellowship, was there was less character development.  That is no longer the case after watching the extended cut.  The movie was much darker than the Fellowship, as was the book, so I felt that the writers tried just a little to hard for laughs at times when the story was not meant to be funny...ie.  while Rohan men are dying on the way to Helm's Deep or during the battle itself.  I think the forced humor lessened the dark mood of the story, which may have been what they were trying to do, but I thought it was too much, and hope for less wisecracks in the middle of a battle to save the world, in ROTK.  That being said, Jackson and Co. are marvelous storytellers.  Many small changes added to the visual experience what the book could not.  The acting (and casting) was superior, and THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOVIE AS VISUALLY STUNNING!  Due to the excellence of the fist two parts of the story, I am anticipating ROTK like no other movie...EVER!!!  As if this were not enough, the bonus discs were great.  I thought they might be recycled versions of the bonus material in Fellowship, but that was not the case at all.  This movie set is definitely the crown jewel of my movie collection...I would have pai twice what I did for it...it's that good!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was immensely pleased and overwhelmingly entertained by this marvelous television series that I had bought on DVD. FIREFLY, which aired on Fox, was not familiar to me as I had missed it when televised about a year ago. Ah, but when I started watching the DVD series, I was well rewarded with a purely pleasurable experience.<br />The show was remarkably brilliant, with great humor throughout the series, and interesting new concepts included in this scifi space opera. Imagine a western set in space and one gets images of dusty frontier towns, low slung shooting irons, horses and saloon brawls, along with space ships and EVA suits, and that is just what Firefly delivers. It seemed to me like the story of Jesse James set 500 years in the future where the outlaws ride spaceships as well as horses, and space suits as well as dusters!<br />The cast is excellent, headed up by Nathan Fillion as Capt. Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds. The ensemble cast includes Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin (who is amazingly beautiful), Jewel Staite, Adam Baldwin (primary source of comic relief) Sean Maher, Summer Glau, and Ron Glass.<br />And as avidly as I rave about the Firefly series, I think it is simply terrible!<br />It is terrible that Fox dropped this excellent series, which was a breath of fresh air to those weary of lawyer shows, reality programs, cop shows and medical dramas! Firefly was new, inventive and clever. It was also cancelled, and what a travesty!<br />It is simply terrible that such an excellent program is no longer available to legions of fans who first realized its greatness, and the many who came afterward, long after network execs had made the blunder of dumping this show.<br />It would be simply terrible if somebody else, like the SciFi channel perhaps, doesn't pick this up and run with it.<br />I really hope they will come up with a feature length film, and kick-start renewed interest in this show, and that it will again find a network with sufficient dedication to artistic expression to run with this project.<br />All in all, I give the thing 5 stars, as one of the most entertaining series I have ever seen in my life! And I think it is simply terrible that I cannot give it 10 stars! Well done, Crew!artistic expression to run with this project. <br />All in all, I give the thing 5 stars, as one of the most entertaining series I have ever seen in my life!

Amaia's voice is excellent, very well trained and she really knows how to use it... the band is really good and although they still have a lot to learn in the field, they have a great idea of it and for all you people who think it's a bad group... you have absolutely no knowledge in music and you don't appreciate real music...<BR>Las canciones y en general el cd es, en mi opinion musical, excelente. No solo porque es en verdad muy creativo en sus liricas (por las metaforas que usan en cada cancion)y en sus ritmos y tempos, sino porque tiene un verdadero talento musical. La voz de Amaia es excelente, muy bien entrenada y de verdad sabe como manejarla... la banda es muy bueno y aunque todavia tienen que aprender mucho acerca de musica, tiene una muy buena idea de lo que hacen y para todos ustedes que piensan que es un pesimo grupo... no tienen ni idea de lo que es la musica y no saben apreciar musica de verdad.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|If you're looking at this as a Christmas gift for your young daughter... beware.  Although this has many songs with a catchy hook that I find even myself singing along to, several of the songs reflect her newly found maturity.  Unless you don't mind your 8 year old singing a song about masturbation, I'd only recommend this for listeners about 16 and up.
B00005M989|5.0|I don't own this CD because I don't need to. I have all of these songs from their original albums. BUT, I cannot imagine denying that all of these songs are classics! Not everyone is hip to the art of the man so for those that need a quick fix, I suggest &quot;The Very Best...&quot; We all have our opinions of the best but art is art. It is a little ridiculous to expect ALL of his best songs on one cd and to say what a &quot;true Prince fan&quot; would like. I personally would not choose so many radio friendly songs for my collection of the &quot;best&quot; but others have to start somewhere!
B00000JCOV|5.0|I just had to right a review after I read someones review talking about the only reason I have heard slipknot is because of some people in suits. I had never even heard of slipknot when I first heard a track from the first CD. Before slipknot I was listening to the Wallflowers, and matchbox 20. But when I did hear my first track (SIC) I was hooked and I have been a fan ever since. So pls give this CD a chance because you never know what you may like until youve listened to it. oh yeah, the CD kicks ass and my favorite song on it is purity (which is actually not on this CD, it was on the earlier ones) but if not that then Me Inside. And BTW I do still like wallflowers and matchbox 20.
B000099T2L|1.0|I bought it &amp; it was very disappointing. The only acceptable songs are the two singles &quot;Baby boy&quot; and &quot;crazy in love&quot; and I wasn't even too crazy about those two songs. The Gold-member song always sounded hysterical to me. All other songs are simply boring. Especially strange is the last song about &quot;I want a man like my Daddy&quot;. That really makes one shudder. This album is a no-go for me.
B00004RFFL|2.0|I had severe d&eacute;j&agrave; vu watching this. Charlize Theron plays the exact same character she played in Devil's Advocate, alongside another cutie, Keanu Reeves. Except she has an extremely boyish haircut in this (does NOT suit her), and she doesn't dye her hair at any point brown, and start screaming at the slightest thing.<br />The thing that I've noticed been said about Devil's Advocate &amp; this is that they compare it to Rosemary's Baby. Which doesn't help if you've never seen it like me. So all the comparisons just go straight over my head.<br />I only taped this off the TV ages ago for Johnny Depp. And wasn't too disappointed in the entire film. It had a good storyline and apart from Charlize Theron doing her one expression - bored - I did enjoy the film.<br />Then the ending came, and I was holding onto a cushion like grim death, and hiding my face partly behind it. The ending changed my whole perspective of the film, and subsequently lowered my stars scale to 2. I didn't completely understand the ending, and my Dad got quite fed up trying to explain and figure out what exactly I didn't understand about the movie. If the ending had been left alone, and just been a happy ending (it is technically, but not the way I wanted it to be), then I would have been fine. But no, they had to go and totally confuse me. Didn't really make much sense to stupid me.<br />Don't go into this expecting a great, Armageddon-esque film. It's not. It's a very strange film. And you definitely need to see Rosemary's Baby first, to be able to understand the comparisons!
B000002L9B|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Prince albums. Yes I did go see the movie and I watch it all the time. It didn't get the acceptance it deserved nor did the soundtrack. <br />\\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\" starts the party perfectly with a wonderful blend into \\"New Position\\"- sexy! \\"I Wonder U\\" is a short track with a relaxing moderate tempo to chill with. The excitement continues with transitions between tempos and moods- it's perfect for just listening straight through. \\"Sometimes it snows in April\\" always brought a tear to my eye- When I was younger I went to see Joffrey's Ballet perform \\"Billboards\\" and when they played that song I could feel the emotion all over again. My favorite song remains to be \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\".<br />This soundtrack and the \\"Dead Presidents\\" are my two favorites of all time!
0783117523|5.0|Angelina Jolie is an amazing actress and her performance in this movie is unforgettable. This movie depicts the rise and the downfall of the fashion career of Gia Carangi and depicts her life so truthfully and tastefully. It portrays the entire culture of the 1980's, the drugs, alcohol, all the temptations that this young woman faced and eventually gave in to. It was both amazing and painful to watch Gia struggle with drug addiction, loss of loved ones, rising to the top of the fashion world, being rich and successful and then eventually hitting rock bottom. The movie also portrayed this young woman with what was a new disease called AIDS and the pain she had to go through and having to die at such a young age. With amazing clothes from the booming 80's fashion era, chilling camera shots depicting the pain and joy in Gia's life, superb score and brilliant performances by Faye Dunaway, Mercedes Ruehl, Elizabeth Mitchell Gia is a amazing glimpse into the life and untimely death of this trend setting model and Angelina Jolie being the versatile and real actress she is breathes life into this film making it intelligent, sassy and a tragic story about a young woman nobody will ever forget.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|First of all, if you're looking for the stuff that Britney did on her first album, then go listen to that album. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be maturing and growing with her. There's nothing I can't stand more than an artist that releases the same album over and over again and Britney is definitely NOT guilty of that on &quot;In The Zone.&quot; The entire set sparkles like the glam queen that Britney is. The production is off the hook and the songwriting is creative to say the least. Britney contributed more to the writing on this album than on any of her past releases and she definitely has something to be proud of. High points include the supercharged &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, and &quot;Everytime&quot;, which in my opinion is the most beautiful ballad that she's ever done. <BR>Britney dared to push the envelope on this one and get a little edgy and the result is simply radiant! Way to go Brit!!!
B000059XYL|3.0|It's an extremely slow film, and not much of it is featured in the bar, as you'd expect after watching the trailer. I went into this blind, expecting a great feel good movie. And what did I get? A girl (Piper Perabo) who obviously can't sing &quot;Can't Fight The Moonlight&quot; (Leann Rimes does it better, and only has a small cameo towards the end), and is the spitting image of ex All Saints singer, Melanie Blatt.<br />This film is very disappointing. Don't watch it with your hopes high. It's predictable, and you were laying out the plot before it was happening. Of course she's going to lose the job because of stupid Adam Garcia; of course something's going to happen to her Dad AFTER they have fallen out and she decides to come back and live in her hometown; there will be a big situation in the bar, which she defuses (by singing?!); and of course, she &amp; Adam Garcia will live happily ever after.<br />I think if the film had been based more in the bar, then it would have been slightly better, but then it ran the chance of being boring, and too repetitive. But then the only scenes I enjoyed in this film were the madcap 'Coyotes' dancing on the bar.<br />This movie had great potential. Shame they didn't attempt anything never already done about the movie.
B000002L68|5.0|How can you talk about classic music from the 80's without including Prince- especially his most critically acclaimed LP?  I read a comment from another reviewer about other songs from the movie not being included on the soundtrack, but those songs were not nearly as good. I am very happy that \\"Modernaire\\" by Dez was left off. Perhaps Prince heard such complaints from others and thus made the mistake of including The Time, Tevin Campbell and Mavis Staples on the \\"Graffiti Bridge\\" soundtrack. Extra people only weaken the art, Prince did well enough alone on this effort. If anything, he should have had \\"Erotic City\\" on the soundtrack, but that would have been too much- that was reserved for the B-side lovers.<br />Who doesn't love the eerie intro to the electrifying \\"Let's Go Crazy\\", the passion of \\"The Beautiful Ones\\", the darkness of \\"Computer Blue\\", the gritty sexuality of \\"Darling Nikki\\", the energy of both \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" and \\"Baby I'm A Star\\"?! I could go on but these are some of my favorite songs from childhood- HE IS THE MAN!
0312263120|2.0|Priot to taking on the Da Vinci Code, I thought I would read the Digital Fortress to get a feel for the author. The first 100 pages set up a very interesting premise but the storyline, involving a couple of all too perfect protagonists, then got preposterous; sort of like a soap opera. The plot took the reader down a lot of boring dead ends and the ending was all too predictable. <BR>Overall, the writing was shockingly bad for an accomplished author. By most accounts he has improved for the Da Vinci Code. <BR>Thank goodness.
B00005Y7AW|4.0|Rufus is just great. I dont understand how can people be critical to his voice, he just has a wonderfull and very tecnical voice. This album as one of my favourite songs ever-In A Graveyard - my god its just beautifull... I hope he could some day perform in Portugal, ill be there shure... be well
B000002LRX|5.0|I bought this album sometime over the summer. Nobody recomended this to me, I'd never heard any of their stuff, and I wasn't familiar with the band at all (unless you consider their poster hanging in the background in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.) I simply bought this album because I'd seen it on that movie. The first listen proved well and then as I began to listen to it more, it grew on me. I swear it keeps getting better every time. All of the songs are unmatched and there are no fillers. Faith No More proves that they can do their own thing and it sounds great. This album doesn't get redundant due to the variety of each song. As for the band... the drummer is great. Just listen to his pace and how he keeps up with each song. The keyboard sets the atmosphere, the guitar is medicore, however it does sound very good, and the bass will groove you. The thing that should really grab you is the vocals. <BR>If you enjoy FNM, check out Fantomas.
B000002KLP|4.0|I would say this was a great way to start out the 80's- a nice risque album complete with the \\"dirty\\" cover. This was never one of my favorite Prince albums yet it still had an amazing amount of playtime in my stereo. I like every song- my favorites are \\"Do it All Night\\" and \\"Head\\". However, I never appreciated \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" until I heard him perform it recently. I have to admit I slept on this one- it's a fine piece of work that defined the sincere sexuality and talent to expect from a star in the making. If you want to dig into the past for music that opened the doors to a new sound of funk, pick up \\"Dirty Mind\\"
B00005JKC3|3.0|That is how long it took Dad Banner (Nick Nolte) to approach his son in a military warehouse towards the end of the movie.  Not a single word uttered, he just gets out of the car and walks towards him.  It took even longer than real-time.<BR>This is only one of several scenes that had me hanging, hanging over the sofa with my finger on the FForward on my remote waiting for something....anything...to happen.  The editor for this movie, if there was one, really did a poor job. The pace is unbelievably slow. <BR>Hulk was somewhat entertaining but a bit too deep for the kids. I loved the style which almost made up for the lack of substance and coupled with the Burtonesque score was really a treat.  It delivers in some respects but is not as memorable as Spiderman or even the original Batman in '89 that sort of kickstarted this genre.  Both of those movies left you with that mixed emotion of the superhero complexity and made you reflect a bit - &quot;what if I had this ability....&quot;<br />Frankly, if you can appreciate a solid production worthy of pre-CGI effects, get your hands on the newer DVD of the Superman original - really quite a beautiful movie for its time with much more memorable performances.  And kids these days laugh at the credits in the beginning (sparklers in outer space!) but about 30 minutes into it are absolutely captivated because there was a great story unfolding. <BR>I can't say the same for Hulk.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|\\"Interstella 5555\\" is a brilliant take on music videos, movie musicals, and anime.  \\"Interstella\\" is \\"Fantasia\\" for a new generation, but instead of orchestrated music, you have the sound of Daft Punk.<br />The film follows a rock band of four blue humanoid looking aliens.  During one of there concerts on there home planet, they are kidnapped by a evil record producer named Earl de Darkwood.  He takes them to Earth and forcefully transforms them into a band for humans.  There only hope is another alien space jockey named Shep, who is the only one who can save them.<br />The art in this movie is gorgeous.  Leiji Matsumoto's work in \\"Interstella\\" is a perfect example of why 2-D animation is not dead yet.  The character models are very nice looking and the backgrounds flourish with depth and color.<br />Daft Punk's music is a matter of taste.  You ether love the club/funk/rock genera, or you do not.  Because there is no dialog, the music not only must set the mood, but also tell the story and if you don't like the music, then you probably won't like the film.  All the music is taken form the album \\"Discovery\\" and fits very well with the themes of the movie, being space, love, mystery, and others.<br />My only complaint would be that the music does not fit totally sometimes with what is happening on screen.  When you have a song the is somber and slow, but you have the screen filled with action scenes, it doesn't fit as well.  I wish they could have fit everything together perfectly like in the \\"Fantasia\\" films, but the music is mostly beats.  It would just be too crazy to have so many jump cuts.<br />If you enjoy great dance music and anime, or just want to see something that is different from everything else coming out this year, check out this movie.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Best jazz piano and singing I have heard in 30 years! Boy does she cook, especially on deed I do! Can't get enough of it-- she plays a mixture of the great jazz piano artists plus her own twists. This is my Christmas present this year for all!<br />I can only hope she does more live concert CDs again in the future. Makes the adrenaline flow like nothing else.<br />Wonderful!
B0000D96NW|5.0|You MUST BUY THIS ALBUM.  This is their best cd since \\"The More Things Change..\\"  This cd mixes a lot of the old with some of the new.  Great heavy music!!
0800141849|3.0|This is a fun-to-watch romantic comedy. Everyone is mostly good in it, especially Lauren Bacall as Rose's bitter, impossible-to-please, interfering mother.<br />I had a few gripes, though. Why couldn't Streisand set aside her personal vanity long enough to play Rose as physically unattractive as possible? There isn't that much difference in the post-makeover Rose, except that she becomes more of a bitchy, smartass with dark roots. And for being the co-star, Jeff Bridges gets MUCH less camera time than Streisand does. Gee, considering who directed the film, it's no wonder why.<br />I agree with the previous reviewer who berated Rose's college lecture scene. No university professor I've known would lecture in that manner - WAY too unprofessional. Maybe at a community college, though...<br />I did like the film's ending - Greg and Rose wind up together for the right reasons. Had the film continued, or (God forbid) a sequel been made, certainly Greg would have encouraged Rose to go back to looking more like her former fat, frumpy self. I'll bet that ending-scene cab ride resulted in a visit to the pastry shop.
B00005RZV4|5.0|I must start by saying I bought this cd not knowing what to expect as I have never listened to NIN before I bought this cd. I have of course heard &quot;closer&quot; along with &quot;Head Like A Hole&quot; and a few others, but that is about it. This cd is a tribute to good live perfomances, I have been listening to it ever since I bought it
B000055Y0Y|4.0|Clint Eastwood(Blood Work, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly), a cop..was one of the guys who protected John F. Kennedy before he was assassinated...now he is jumping threw hoops for some killer who likes to toy and play with him..great suspense and Eastwood is a charm to watch..John Malkovich(Knockaround Guys, Con Air) is always evil...there's no denying that. directed by Wolfgang Petersen also starring Rene Russo(Get Shorty, The Thomas Crown Affair), Dylan McDermott(Tv's The Practice, The Cowboy Way), Gary Cole(A Simple Plan, I:Spy), Fred Dalton Thomas(Die Hard 2: Die Harder, Tv's Law and Order), Joshua Malina(Tv's Sports Night, Tv's The West Wing), John Mahoney(Tv's Fraiser, The Hudsucker Proxy), and Steve Railsback(Slash, Made Men). good cat and mouse game
B00005QBER|3.0|\\"Lovedrive\\" from 1979 was sort of a musical redirection for Scorpions. New lead guitar player Mathias Jabs took over after Uli Roth and the band started its journey towards a more mainstream approach, even it's not that clear at first sight. The songs are rather good but there's something disturbing that I just can't put my finger on - could it be the production/sound? Songs like \\"Another piece of meat\\" and \\"Lovedrive\\" are really good but something is missing and I just don't know what it is! With this album, Scorpions recorded the ballads \\"Always somewhere\\" and \\"Holiday\\" and it's obvious that the guys felt they really found their own way of writing ballads. Compare these tracks with upcoming songs like \\"When the smoke is going down\\" and \\"Still loving you\\" and you'll see that they are all written in the same fashion. The highlight on this album is the reggae inspired \\"Is there anybody there?\\" which shows a different and interesting side of Scorpions. Michael Schenker (ex UFO), who is Rudolf's brother and was a member of the original line up, is doing a guest appearance and playing solo on three songs. If you're a bit picky, be sure to get a copy with this original cover instead of the boring alternative one that has been released (to avoid upsetting people?). It says that this one is remastered but I can't hear any obvious proof that the sound have been improved. And while I'm at it, do not pay too much attention to the lyrics that sometimes are what you would call not of highest quality. But remember - these guys are from Germany.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I will keep this short but sweet, since there are a number of other well-written reviews here. My opinion: I highly recommend this set of DVDs for anyone who likes good quality sci-fi programs. Why FOX killed it off is still a complete mystery to me. Note that this DVD contains all the aired episodes, plus three completed eps that were unaired when the series was cancelled!
B000089RVX|5.0|When Evanescence's previous CD came out (Origin) I didn't even hear about it. When this CD came out, it was all over the radio (well Bring Me to Life &amp; Going Under anyway) and I loved the songs. I never seriously listened to rock before but this CD is so cool. I like just about every song on the CD and that's really rare for me. My favorites are My Last Breath, My Immortal, and Going Under. GREAT CD. . GET IT!
B00008973Q|1.0|RAN is a masterpiece of a film and this review is not about the quality of the movie but about the quality of this DVD.  If you play this DVD on a 32&quot; non-widescreen TV the picture will look passable as a &quot;letterboxed&quot; film, but be sure to rent and try this edition out on your 50&quot; or 55&quot; or 65&quot; wide-screen TV before buying!  The first problem is that the anamorphic picture cuts off the edges of the credits (a clue that you're not getting all of the frame).  Even more disturbing is that the image has an electronic &quot;video&quot; cast to it.  Unlike good DVD transfers, there is twitching to still objects on-screen like lattice or anything with parallel lines.  The colors are bright but lacking definition (they give off an aura) and again have an electronic cast that looks more like video than film.  Overall this transfer is deplorable, and the fact that Wellspring is proud of this &quot;hi-def&quot; transfer is shocking.<br />As someone who owns over 300 movies on DVD and has seen the full range of quality from early full-screen knock-offs like National Lampoon's VACATION to fantastic DVD's like the LOTR editions and X-MEN, I know what the standard is for a special version of a DVD in November 2003, and this disc does not cut it.  Wellspring . . . get your act together.
080726203X|5.0|This book is awesome to read when you are bored or when you just feel like reading. I really enjoyed this book because it talks about how the future society isnt perfect even though they try to perfect it and how feeling of pain and sufferage needs to be there even though they block it. Great book to read, you should definately get it.
0783226063|5.0|I loved the movie and have already seen it 4 times (and read the book about 7) It is neccessary to pay attention when watching as there is a lot of information that can be lost if your mind wanders for a few weconds, but the film is very true to this wonderful classics. It is possible that it it would be best to read the book before watching this movie. I love the plush, archaic costumes and props, most of the actors are remarkable, and it actually comes over as believable! No mean feat! I'm a grandmother now, but I loved the book and movie as a much younger woman, and can reccomend them to people of any age above 12.
B00000IPAX|1.0|If you like Buddah, Cheshire Cat, or Dude Ranch do not buy this CD! This CD was the beginning ot the change of Blink 182 from a wonderful melodic punk band to a pop staple. If you like their old music, and are a long time fan, this CD along with the releases that have followed it will disgust you. I bought it, not knowing it would destroy my love and respect for the band. I gave it away, I disliked it so much. There is a ton of new sound changes and back up vocals on this CD. It is not the melodic punk that Blink 182 normally writes. Save your money! This CD sucks!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Even though the Fab Four is down to only two living members, it seems the animosity that led to their breakup is alive and well. It's the only justification for the release of &quot;Let It Be - Naked.&quot; Paul McCartney seems to still hold a grudge against his former bandmates (as evidenced by his decision to reverse the songwriting credits on his last live disc so that &quot;Lennon-McCartney&quot; now reads &quot;McCartney-Lennon&quot;) and this release seems little more than an attempt to kick sand in their faces for their williness to let Phil Spector augment their second to last recording sessions with his famous Wall of Sound.<br />Thankfully, the recordings are much better than the ghastly cover and the tasteless title, but though the selections sound a little different than they do on the album released in 1970, they have not been improved. In some cases, notably the title track and &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; the absence of Spector's production robs them of some of their emotional impact. In other cases, the change is barely noticeable. And if this is, in fact, an untainted document of the album as originally conceived, why have several selections been abandoned (Lennon's inconsequential but amusing &quot;Dig It&quot;) and recordings that weren't intended for this record (Lennon again, with the superb &quot;Across the Universe&quot;) left in the lineup?<br />This is an album for diehard completists. Everyone else should probably take the title to heart and let it be.
0345452577|1.0|I adore Jonathan Kellerman and never thought I'd dislike anything he wrote but this book was so disappointing. I always want Alex Delaware but I recognize that authors get different voices in their heads and, on that basis, I did struggle through the Billy Straight book, knowing that Alex would not be far behind.  I found this story to be totally unrealistic and I know Kellerman can do better.  What truly concerns me, though, is that he revealed only bits and pieces of Jeremy's history, which makes me think that this character will be back.  NOOOOO!<br />The story sets up well but, in my opinion, goes downhill from there.  Jeremy is a suspect in a variety of killings, all the while continuing his practice and no one at the hospital seems aware of the suspicion.  He becomes erratic in his behavior and obsessed with his private investigation and no one is the wiser.  Meanwhile, he seems to possess superhuman powers with patients.<br />I must say that this book reminded me very much of Chasing the Dime by Michael Connelly.  No, there are no similarities in the stories but both, in my opinion, are beneath the authors' amazing abilities.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I like this bad because they dont sound like the typical bands and there music is awesome!
B00014NE62|5.0|from what i've gathered from other sites, this full-lengthed letterboxed edition will include new cast & crew interviews, the theatrical trailer, and more importantly, 30 addition minutes of deleted and alternate footage! this is a wonderful film and my hat's off to the producers for going the extra mile and including all the extra material! it sounds spectacular! (and its way-y-y about time for the official dvd release!)
B00006V9A0|1.0|This is a great album from nirvana great songs all around. only if kurt was still alive the song would just keep comin and comin
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release.  Note, that this version has more than just new scenes.  Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way.  The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow.  Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original.  Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn).  It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.<br />The disk 3 and 4 extras (which worked perfectly, BTW) are also a real treat.  The section on Gollum and Andy Serkis alone is worth the extra money.<br />So, just like with the &quot;Fellowship&quot; DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning.  I already plan on only getting the extended version of &quot;King&quot; next year.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|OMG all of the greatest ACDC songs on 2 CD's how frickin great is that
B000062Y98|5.0|When I first bought this c.d., I popped it in the machine and was rather un-impressed, I was hoping for another Nightfall In Middle-Earth and didn't really give it a chance. However the next day I thought i'd give it a chance, and it blew me away! once you get past the first track, it's almost jaw-dropping how amazing Blind Guardian are. My favorite tracks are; The Soulforged and Punishment Divine, two of the greatest songs i've ever heard, BY ANY BAND OR GENRE. These guys deserve to be making millions, not Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit etc.... Kind of a shame....<br />Go out and BUY this NOW! give it a chance and you WILL NOT regret it!!

B000001F9N|5.0|Enough of how this album became my initiation into a lifetime of Donna Summer fandom.  This album is the bridge from sexual overdrive enrapturing Love To Love You Baby (and the Pillow Talk, Midnight At The Oasis, and other breathy swoons of the day) to the land of the mainstream disco.  While still breathing and moaning in trademark fashion throughout the album, Donna has the guts to take on a cover of Manilow's Could It Be Magic, something lesser artists wouldn't dare do with material of such iconic status.  And by doing it, Donna surpasses Barry and lets us hear her cut loose with all of her voice at the end of the song.  Try Me...Suite on Side 1 was so good that it, along with Could...was chosen for the soundtrack of the infamous \\"Looking For Mr. Goodbar.\\"  In fact, I think Could... is playing when Diane Keaton's character meets her demise.  The long first side suite set the tone for many to follow including Carol Douglas, Marlena Shaw, and countless others who learned that this tactic ensured their play time and exposure at the disco.  This album is so good that it was hard for me to wrench it out of my mother's hands as a teenager...she was hell bent on playing it to motivate her doing housework.  The cover art was revisited in her 1996 tour, and the expression is one that Donna still gets on her face today.  True artistry.  All cuts romantic, sensual and A+++.  A logical foundation to build her next concept albums from in its mini-concept seduction theme.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this is by far brits best album, all the songs in it are absolutely fantastic, one thing that really surprised me was the fact theres not even one song by Max Martin or Rami, wich I think proves how britney is changing and evolving as an artist, leaving behind her bubblegum sound.
0385504209|5.0|I was standing on the beach last summer talking to a friend when she recommended this book.  I enjoyed it so much that after reading it, I went on to read every other book that Dan Brown has written, and I loved them all.  Several times during the reading of this book I had to go to the Internet to look up items involved in the story, and felt that I ended up with a book that not only entertained me, but enriched me from a cultural standpoint.  However, there's an even bigger story out there.  What if Jesus returned and everyone missed it?  &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; by William Sears tells the story of his personal search for the answer to this question, and I'm hoping Dan Brown will pick up on it someday and turn it into another best seller.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I have been disappointed by many sophomore albums by truly great artistes in the past. Although the albums were really good, they just couldn't compare, I thought. But, compared to what? That's when I realised that my expectations were way too high seeing their incredible debut. Hence, I decided not to judge this album the same way I did for so many others before. <br />Judging this objectively, I was not swayed by my own definitions and expectations but taken by the flow of Alicia's creative energy. I'm reminded that the music I'm hearing is a reflection of the artiste's expression and not subject to my desires of how it should have been arranged or even sung.<br />It also isn't fair for people to compare the lyrical content and vocal styles of the debut and Diary. Songs in A Minor was a collection of her journey through life through many, many years (if you remember, Butterflyz was written when she was 14). Definitely, Alicia has gone through a whole lot more struggle then compared to the 2 to 3 years she wrote The Diary. Moreover, life in those few years has been good to her since establishing herself as one of the greatest musical discoveries of the decade. Had she written anything like Troubles in Diary (no doubt it being a really inspirational song), I would be quite shocked actually. <br />This undeniably comes to show that Alicia is one artiste who is true to her feelings and who expresses what she really goes through in life, rather than attempting to sound deep by writing another emotionally moving piece inspired from who-knows-what considering how good life has been treating her. Another evidence? Listen to Wake Up and you will see how honest she is. <br />Many also claim that she samples too many songs on Diary. I do not see this as a problem at all if her intentions were to introduce to us younger generation the brilliance that was music from the past. It's not like she did not credit those from which she sampled. In fact, if it were not for Alicia, most of us wouldn't know the sheer greatness of these other musicians who clearly have influences on Alicia as well. So, to criticize her for this would be kinda hypocritical. For me, I am thankful she has chosen to do so, to introduce them to me.<br />To the many who think they are disappointed by this album, I highly recommend a review of your personal reviews with greater objectivity and clarity of judgement. Alicia still has a long way to go and I believe in time she will be an unbelievable musician, a truly honoured classic.
B00006HAZG|1.0|No WAY! This movie su*ks, and because there's a Daniel Radcliffe playing in it!<br />I'm going to tell the truth, the boy doesn't know how to act that's it!<br />Thank You, but I'm going out from Amazom.com without this stuff.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The added scenes do make it better, yes.<BR> We get a bit more fleshing out of newer characters, such as Eowyn, in an uncharacteristic scene (so says PJ in the commentary, and I agree) which serves the purpose of revealing Aragorn's age of 87, we get more of Faramir with a compassionate monologue over the body of the dead Oliophaunt rider, an introduction to Denethor, and a blink more Eomer as he searches for Theoden's son in a butchered heap of Rohan and Orcish soldiers.<BR>As far as older characters: we see a splash more dialogue from Arwen, more tortured, unloved Gollum scenes (now, more people are mean to him), the beloved Ent-draught scenes where Pippin and Merry grow, and their raiding of Saruman's food and tobacco stash in Isengard.<BR>The pluses of the extended scenes in The Two Towers is that, unlike in the Fellowship where the Tolkien-familiar viewer gets more of his/her favorite scenes, this version of TTT is fuller in feel, are a little more congruent, and the new-to-Tolkien viewer feels more prepared to go into the next part of the story in the following movie, i.e., The Return of the King.<BR>While I still feel that Faramir's &quot;uncertain if he's a hero&quot; role was a bit redundant in the theatrical release, his aiding Frodo at the end and redeeming himself by showing his true heroic quality is necessary viewing in preparing for ROTK, even if PJ changes the story around.<BR>As reluctant as I am to admit it, Jackson's changes (with the exception of the Eowyn soup-making extended scene) work very well to make a compact (9 hours IS very hard to do justice to Tolkien's Masterpiece), true-to-feel piece of cinema, as well as a coherent, satisfying movie chopped into three large chunks.<BR>Can't wait for the third part!! T-minus.....<BR>Oh, and did I mention the HILARIOUS Easter Egg (sad too few of these. What, ONE? c'mon...) of Gollum's acceptance speech at the MTV movie awards!<BR>As always, all the WETA workshop/behind the scenes features are always very satisfying to watch. Just time consuming. I recommend dedicating an entire day/evening to them.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I have always been a BEP fan.  Fergie, sam-i-am and the rest of the crew are unreal.  I have danced all my life and I am choreographing a fashion show this year.  If it was possible I would make sure &quot;Labor day&quot; &quot;Lets Get Retarded&quot; &quot;Shutup&quot; &quot;Hey Mama&quot; and &quot;Latin Girls&quot; were all used in the show! They are amazing dance songs. I wouldn't listen to the other reviewers who say that only a couple of songs are good on this CD.  I listen to a wide variety of music and I always switch my CDs in my car when I drive (and I am in my car a lot!)...BUT I have had this CD for two months and it has not left its spot in my player. Lets say the drivers around me must think I'm crazy because at every red light they see me dancing in my car!!  To say I am obsessed with this CD is an understatement.  Buy this CD, it is cheap (I see it is selling for 11.99 and free shipping) and I promise it will make you want to get up and dance!  If not I know tons of friends who would want the CD if you would like to give it away!
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is one of the few movies from the nineties that I would consider to be a classic.  It is a movie that will be watched 20, 30, 40 years down the road.  Not only is it's story of self discovery, freedom, and shucking of stereotyped societal roles amazingly well done by a crew of actors that defies reason, but the cinematography, lighting, and directing are all above reproach.  When you think that this is Alan Ball's first cinema script, and that it is Sam Mendes' movie directorial debut, one can only imagine their future.  Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts) is another new comer whose future can only be described as bright.  Combine that with the proven acting genius of Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, and you have an amazing cinematic journey into the dream life of every Tom, Dick, and Harry
0385504209|4.0|This lively mystery takes us all the way back to the time of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and to a centuries old search for the Holy Grail.  Along the way we meet a fairly interesting cast of characters and events filled with the twists and turns that leave the reader speculating on who is friend and who is enemy, and whether or not the hero and heroine will fall in love.  I was intrigued by the author's exploration of the relationship of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and of the way in which Christianity and Catholicism over the centuries have supposedly dealt with woman and their potential for power and influence.  The story of the battles within the church and the endless intrigues that resulted were fascinating and, for the most part, credible.  I found the end of the book just a bit flat and the tieing together of the various threads somewhat of a stretch of the imagination.  Otherwise the book was an enjoyable read.
B000002W8O|5.0|This is the best Christmas album ever, especially if it's the only one your mother ever let you play on the record player by yourself and when you were 30 and suddenly -- or so you thought -- fell in love with the blues and realized it was Elvis' Blue Christmas, Santa Bring my Baby Back to Me.<br />If you don't have this in your collection, you almost assuredly should add it!
0156027321|5.0|What a charmer this story is!  We meet Pi a young Indian adolescent who is open to all the possibilities of heaven and earth and sea.  The story of this boy, a tiger and the two thirds of a year on a lonely life boat will make you cry, laugh and anticipate potential disasters from beginning to end of the tale.  Don't be deterred by the author's fairly long discussions of religion, philosphy and the rightness of zoos early on in the book.  Pi himself and his own lessons about life and spirituality will carry you through those early chapters.  The story is full of tantalizing twists and turns and an ending that is rich with imagination and reflection and humor.   <br />The style of writing is clear and straightforward.  The story moves the reader to explore the shades of gray in life, rather than the blacks and white that we often hold onto with such fervor when faced with experiences new to us.<br />Try it.  You will like it.  A lot!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead. Politics. I don't know what to say other than those couple of words. I could go on and on about how much I enjoy this album, and how much this band has inspired me and led me to believe that there is some future for the rock industry.<br />Some tend to think of this as 'going back' to previous recording and experimentation. Not at all. This band constantly amazes me with every minute of this album. Being in a band myself, I can't even comprehend the genius it takes to write such songs. Songs that can warm you heart or make you so frightfully paranoid. <br />I prefer not to go into a rundown of each song individually, but I would note that every song has superior craft and musicianship. I'm not trying to sound preachy, and I'm not trying to be hip by listeing to this band. But you can listen to this group 10 times and never really hear them. &quot;2+2=5&quot; is a masochistic prog rock song reminiscent of Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. Other highlights include &quot;Sit down, stand up&quot;, &quot;Where I end and you begin&quot;, and the most experimental track on the disc &quot;Myxamatosis&quot;. The sounds of a diseased rabbit never felt so morbid.<br />I would, however, like to sing out one track in particular. &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;. Of all the tracks this album throws at you, it comes at you the fastest and with the most emotion. So incredibly melodic, but so very violent. &quot;Steal all the children, if I don't pay the ransom.&quot; If this album has a most brilliant moment, I feel it would be in this track.<br />I'm not sure if this album will stand the test of time, as OK Computer has (and it certainly isn't as good), but this band will most definately come to be the most recognizable band in the world. <br />For those of us who listen...
B0000AUHQT|2.0|Promoted heavily at the time of its release for its glamour and high style, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a surprisingly limp film with little of either. There's nothing outstanding about it which, given the money and talent that went into it, is a pretty damning comment. The Newport locations are wasted, and most of the actors come off little better. Ralph Lauren's fashions (highly touted prior to the film's release) don't seem especially special, and Douglas Slocombe's cinematography is disappointingly soft and low contrast. Indeed, the only real sign of the film's budget are the loving shots of expensive cars, clothing and crockery and the endless, over-crowded party scenes. Both give new definition to the word pointless.<br />At the peak of his career, Robert Redford is not bad, but does not seem very well cast and doesn't look that good. Mia Farrow, on the other hand, is too well cast as the flighty, self-indulgent Daisy of his dreams, managing to annoy much more than charm. Bruce Dern is grossly out of scale to the rest of the cast; his racist, brutal posturings seem to belong in another movie. Sam Waterston manages not to disgrace himself in the thankless role of the silent witness to other people's affairs. The only above average performance is by Scott Wilson as the mechanic, George, and even he could stand to have a beat or two trimmed from his suffering.<br />The biggest problem with the movie is its all too apparent effort to overwhelm. A much lighter approach, even an ironic one, would seem to suit the material more effectively. Heavy with the attempt to be atmospheric, it feels overstuffed and tentative. There is no sense that anyone behind or in front of the camera had a driving passion to put the story on the screen, or even bothered to ask why it was being made. It's a ponderous movie, witless and heavy-handed, over-produced and cheap at the same time.
B000002UAI|3.0|I don't know if this Cd good or not since I just &quot;make&quot; my sister by it for me for a Christmas present this year.  I hope the songs are all good and not too slow and boring unlike some of The Beatles CDs are.  E-mail me at thebeatlesfantanya@yahoo.com

0920668364|1.0|My mother in law gave this to her grown son after we were married, WEIRD.  I just sort of tucked it into my daughter's book case...I just re-read it tonight.  It is one more pathetic attempt for a psycho mother to cling to her son. Gross.  Who IS the woman who wrote it? Did she actuall DO this?  I would NEVER buy this as a gift.  If I were the boy in that book I'd be in some serious therapy.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|I ues to like Britney's music, but after hearing this album maybe not.  I really don't even call this real music.  Why she would put out trash like this is beyond me.  It's the worst album I have ever heard in my life.
B00005B1W5|4.0|THis DVd was ok. IT had some bounus on it. There's only like 4 songs that i really liked. If you want Yanni Dvd I suggest his older one, such as LIve at the Acrophis(sorry for my spelling)
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is such a sweet movie.  I admit I cried at a couple points in the movie.  The first point was out of sadness, when Marlin woke up to find that his wife and eggs had been eaten by a shark.  The second time was... well... at first happy, then sad, then happy again.  But since that's toward the end of the movie, I won't discribe that part since I know some people haven't seen it yet.<br />It's probably the most touching Disney/Pixar movie since Toy Story.  And the animation's really good.  I love how Disney always has a way of making animals so human-like.  <br />It's a really good movie for both adults and kids.  And there's some fun special features, too.
B00005LOUP|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think of this when I first saw it but I can say that the live action version of HTGSC made a decent effort as far as holding up to the original. Jim Carrey definately steals the show for the most part (no pun intended). The other characters however did not hold up well enough in my opinion to make this a superb movie. Kids will certainly enjoy this to the fullest but adults may only be amused by Jim Carrey's performance and not much else. Don't get me wrong, this movie is good for family get-togethers over the holidays. The special features on the DVD are a definate plus which is why I'm giving HTGSC a 4th star. As I said before, Jim Carrey fans will be pleased with this and I don't think anyone else could have pulled off the Grinch the way he did.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Great movie, even better than Fellowship.  Of course, if you haven't seen Fellowship (i.e. if you've been living in a cave), you're going to need to see that one first.  Otherwise you'll be completely lost.  <br />The only thing that's been bugging me about Two Towers is Arwen.  Now, if you've read all three of the books, you know that in Return of the King, Aragorn and Arwen get married.  I'm very worried about whether that's going to happen in the movie.  (Hey, what can I say, I'm a girl, I like a little bit of romance with my action).  Because they showed her in the movie walking with all the other elves to take the ship to Valinor.  But I've seen a couple previews for Return of the King and Arwen seems to be in it, so we'll see what happens.<br />I of course can't wait till Return of the King comes out, but for now, I'm satiated with the Extended version of Two Towers (I also have the extended version of Fellowship).  So once Return of the King comes out on the extended DVD, I'm going to have about a 12 hour Lord of the Rings movie marathon.  <br />Once again, if you had trouble sitting through the 3-hour version and don't think you have the attention span for any more of it, then stick with the version that was released in theaters.  But if you actually have an attention span, go for the extended version.  There's some great stuff in it that isn't in the original version.  I haven't watched the two bonus disks yet, but if they're anything like the one's for Fellowship, I can probably do without seeing them.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|In general I like this CD, but it was not what I expected. If you like Metallica from the &quot;And Justice for All&quot; era (and I do)you will like this. The lyrics are ok and the execution of this type of Prog Metal is very good. Mike Portnoy is outstanding. Jordan Rudess doesn't get much of chance to strut his stuff here since John Petrucci is busy sounding like a cross between James Hetfield and Eddie Van Halen on speed. Seriously, some of his solos sound like they were recorded then sped up to a ridiculous speed. Where's the heart and soul? I thought they were going to be more melodic and have more dynamic complex music instead they just turned up the speed and distortion.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie is definately a classic.  I guess it's somewhat made to be a kids movie... but I'm not sure I'd be letting my kids watch it with David Bowie wearing those tights the whole time.  Not that I really mind personally... but some might not consider that appropriate for kids to see.  Anyway, great movie for laughs and David Bowie lovers.  I mean really, how can you resist him?  He's a good actor and a great singer.  And... well... again, the thing with the tights.... :p
B000002UDD|3.0|After the slow and building success of their previous album Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?, Megadeth went back into the studio and soon released So Far, So Good...So What! While the album is as heavy as their previous two albums, the songwriting appeared to be unfocused when compared to strong albums like Peace Sells... and Rust In Peace.<br />The album starts out promising with the sinister instrumental \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" and the fast riffing of \\"Set The World Afire.\\" Other strong tracks include the excellent \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" and \\"Mary Jane.\\" The rest of the album has the heavy riffing but the songs don't stand out. \\"502\\" and the cover of the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy In The U.K.\\" are okay, but certainly not among their best material. The closing tracks \\"Liar\\" and \\"Hook In Mouth\\" are unmemorable and sound unfinished. The album as a whole has a rushed feel to it. Chief songwriter and guitarist Dave Mustaine was going through some personal problems at this time as well. But he would clean up and the band would release the excellent Rust In Peace in 1990. If you're a diehard fan, you already own this. Newcomers may want to check out Peace Sells... or Rust In Peace first.
0684135051|5.0|since her books were first published, but if you make nothing else from this book, do knit the modular &quot;Tomten&quot; jacket, particularly for a baby.  It stretches to fit for a long time, lasts to be handed down, is very easy to knit, and makes babies look like like wee elves.  Do make it in a beautiful color, to flatter the baby's coloring - raspberry or teal, for example.  This jacket alone should have established EZ as one of the most gifted practitioners of this ancient craft.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am not the biggest fan of Britney's voice, and while I'm not going to divulge into the argument of whether or not she can sing, I can say that I do find some of her work very catchy and likeable.  You can't really say that at one time, you didn't really like singing along to hits like &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; or &quot;Oops!  I Did it Again.&quot;<br />In Britney's fourth album, she matures in her song material a great deal.  She's starting to tread into more adult territory and is experiencing with different grooves other than the traditional bubble-gum pop she's stuck with through most of her career.  In all honesty, this album was quite a surprise to me.  It's much better than I anticipated.  She's trying to establish new ground and make a new image for herself besides the bopping teen idol she's been for most of her career.  While its arguable as to whether or not she accomplishes it with this album, she's definitely on her way.<br />1.  Me Against the Music -- The first single.  It's got a good beat to it and while I don't find the Madonna segments that necessary (probably something added in later to boost up the hype over tha MTV kiss), it's very catchy and easy to get hooked on.  A pretty good choice for the first single.<br />2.  (I Got That) Boom Boom -- If this isn't the second single I'll be a bit surprised.  It's got &quot;clubbing&quot; written all over it.  The Ying Yang twins provide nice backlining to her vocals.  A great tune to dance to.<br />3.  Showdown -- Funky beats, breathy vocals, and twisted guitar lines.  Far different in terms of what she's done so far, not just in terms of lyrical content, but it sounds a lot different.<br />4.  Breathe on Me -- Exactly what it says: Britney's voice in this one is heavily breathy and pant-like, but I rather like it.  The background music is very mysterious and heavily relied on beats, kinda reminds me of Kylie Minogue's music.  <br />5.  Early Mornin' -- I had to listen to this a few times to make sure it was Britney.  Her voice sounds a lot different in this one compared to the others.  Not great, but not bad.<br />6.  Toxic -- Screaming violins and guitar segments.  Probably the most recognizable in terms of the other tracks.  I like how Britney sounds on this one.  A very good track, it's both different and unique.<br />7.  Outrageous -- This is definitely another clubbing tune.  I find it impossible not to get hooked on the catchy rhythms of this one.  A very good addition to the CD.<br />8.  Touch of My Hand -- Don't really care for this one.  I give it props for it's very unorthdox lyrical content, but in terms of musical appeal and vocals, it doesn't do much for me.<br />9.  The Hook Up -- Very funky, but Britney's voice sounds so digital in some of the vocal segments that sometimes it's unrecognizable.  She kinda sounds like Missy Elliot at some points.  The background music actually sounds like something I'd expect in a rapping song.  <br />10.  Shadow -- Now this is a very pretty ballad.  I do agree with her many critics regarding this tune; her voice is not very strong, and it is evident here.  It's also lost a great deal of its former pureness and clarity from her earlier work, which is too bad.  Nonetheless, this ballad is very beautiful.<br />11.  Brave New Girl -- Probably the only track that is very reminiscint of her bubble gum pop days, as it is a track I would've expected to find on one of her earlier CDs.  Her voice is also highly digital here.  If you prefer her earlier style and don't mind the digital quality to her voice, you'll like this one.<br />12.  Everytime -- The final ballad.  I like her voice a lot better on this one than in &quot;Shadow,&quot; it sounds a lot purer and the piano complements her voice well.  A nice closing to the CD.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this CD.  Yeah, there were a few that I could've done without, but hey, every CD has their misses.  If you are looking for Britney to continue her traditional poppy tunes, you won't like this CD.  If you enjoy R&amp;B and hip hop-like beats, give this a try.  I give Britney props for trying something new, and she doesn't do that bad at it.  So give it a chance... you might like it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have to say that I discovered this band on the Billboard music awards last night.  I guess I am out of it because that is the first time I recall hearing them.  I couldn't believe that voice.  At the start of Bring Me To Life I was amazed.  I thought the song was going to be a Sarah Mclachlan like sound.  Then it kicked in.  Well needless to say I went over to my computer and downloaded about 5 songs and listened to them.  I am absolutely amazed by this band.  Especially that voice.  I am on my way to buy the cd so I hope if I get busted for illegal downloading I can just bring the cd in and show the judge.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had been taping the shows and thought, I don't need the DVD set--HA! It's fabulous! No commercials, all the commentary and the interview with the actors--that is the best. You can really tell how much everyone cared about each other, confirming what had been apparent in every episode. I was, still am, a big fan of the show, and you will be too. Everyone will find a favorite character, no matter who you are. The action is great! The intrigue is great! How everyone came together, their hidden pasts, what they mean to each other, it keeps the show alive. So many possibilities for more shows, too bad the network was so, well, you know. I hope they do a movie but I wish they'd do another TV series. Until then you can watch this set over, and over, and over...
0553712837|4.0|John Grisham was successful in Skipping Christmas. It was strange and interested \\"Skipping Christmas\\". Because of the leaving of their daughter, Blair, and the big amount of money they had spent on the previous Christmas. Our characters, Luther and Nora decided to skip Christmas for a trip 10 days to Princess Island in Caribbean. So many chaos things happened around their plan. The author would lead the reader's emotion down to the bottom by Bev's cancer, and went up to the top by the Blair's phone call. Just a phone call, it changed whole plane, Luther and Nora had to do Christmas in 6 hours. They had to have Christmas tree, frosty on the roof, dinner and decorated the house. You will find out the most interesting part of the book in chapter 13 to 20. Luther was arrest by the officers and he was hung up on the roof...<br /> You will find out who will be the meaningful friends in your life, when you are in hardship. And what Christmas means to you. I don't like to read a lot, I would through the book away if it was boring. But with Skipping Christmas, I read it from the beginning to the end without stopping; it was a good one to enjoy.
B000002H6C|5.0|&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; is a great album, but that's no surprise when it comes to Metallica. This was the first metal CD I bought, and the lead track, Blackened, was what got me into rock in the first place. It's just electric. &quot;One&quot; is considered by many people to be the best Metallica song ever written. In short, buy this albu. (Though if you're new to Metallica you might want to start with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; or &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;)
B000060P79|5.0|OMG!!!  I really love this CD!  They're a fun, upbeat band.  They're so fun 2 listen 2.  The best song is &quot;Addicted.&quot;  My second fave is &quot;I'd Do Anything.&quot;  There isn't 1 song on here that i DON'T like.  It's the best CD 2 listen 2 when u need a pick-me-up or just when you're having a good time.  They're better than Good Charlotte (even tho they rock 2).  Sometimes u buy a CD and there is only a couple good songs on it.  That is so not the case here.  You will not waste your money if u buy this.  The 1st time i listened 2 it, i knew that it was good.  If u like slow, boring songs, this is NOT the CD 4 u.  O, and go buy their new DVD, &quot;A BIG PACKAGE FOR YOU.&quot;  You WON'T be disappointed!!
6304493681|3.0|I made the mistake of going by all the reviews and buying this movie without first renting it.  If you like Ninja Scroll because of the action (not to mention actual character development), you probably won't like Ghost in the shell nearly as much. Anyway, watch it before you buy it (you might like, I didn't).
B00000427L|5.0|4 piano concertos by none other than composer Rachmaninov. While I think there are other CD's recommendable for their insightful reading and inspiration (Most notable has to be the Horowitz/Reiner 3rd I want to recommend), there's great piano-playing here (not forgetting the orchestra).<br />A drawback might be that listeners who prefer more 'passion' should maybe look elsewhere: Ashkenazy is a more poetic player, and as such delivers some stunning poetry here. Quality is often the deciding factor, however, and this 2-CD set offers just that. Perhaps you'll find the 2nd here worth the price of admission.<br />Lastly, if you want to look for more forcible playing, then consider Argerich by all means. The Philips full-price CD is great, but Philips also has one mid-priced edition.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|All you people posting bad reviews, Ur just haters, i don't really like Britney I just Hate People that are SELFISH like u all are, Her cd sounds pretty damn cool, So ya should shut the heck up, if you dont like it, DONT LISTEN TO IT DUH!
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie is starring Tim Curry as a creepy clown named Pennywise and John Ritter as Benjamin 'Ben' Hanscom.  A little cheesy at times but all together great!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have been a fan of Britney since the beginning and own all her albums.  I think each album gets better and better and i am glad to hear her moving away from straight bubblegum.  This album has some of her freshest tracks so far.
B00006CXXU|1.0|Im so sick of all these ppl &quot;singing&quot; their music like they're auditioning for American Idol! Overshouting till the point of annoyance. So much it ruins the songs. Shell lose her voice from shouting so much like that. Listen to when she sings normal and hear how much she stinks. When shes not shouting, she sounds like an average girl. She is imitating Whitney and Mariah and their voices were naturally deep and loud. Alicia Keys, C hristina Aguilera and Kelly Clarkson need to start singing and stop shouting. Then you'll see how horrible their voices are. If you want good fun pop music without overshouting check out Madonna or Britney (her debut, not her recent crap). Someone stop them before they ruin their vocal chords!!
B0000AM6LY|3.0|I had Mt. Everest high expectations for this album when I heard the fresh, sun shiny track called Sunrise. It was innovative and was catchy so eagerly my hands snatched up the CD............ But Now? Now, my hands refuse to grab this CD when I'm looking for a good one to listen to. Why? Simply because I thought it was a plastic record with no depth or intovative take on Jazz (except of course, Sunrise.) <BR>May I suggest some of my favorite albums? I like INXS, Massive Attack, Portishead.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This movie wasn't as good as the first.  It seems that the film crew got a big head from the success of the previous installment.  The dance/sex scene was too long and irrelevant to the story.  It would have OK if it were to add some amusment to the movie, but it didn't.  The special effects were OK.  I thought the first one did a better job.  There, they'd slow something down in mid sequence, but here they'd slow down the whole scene.  I think they should have paid more attention to writing story than trying to out do the previous movies fashion and special effects statements.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|this is one of the most crappy repetitive cds ive ever heard in all my life...its even worse than their last one or the one before that (at least their debut had a few ok songs on it) + the vocalist is really bad, he sounds like hes constipated or somethin... if you want some really good repetitive crap, buy some britney spears or that hilary duff person!!!...YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF NOT TO BUY THIS CD!! YOU DESERVE NOT TO HEAR THIS CRAP!!
B000089RVX|3.0|Okay, I really like Bring Me To Life and My Immortal so after the 4th song I start to think, &quot;what a great album this is!&quot;<br />Fast forward to 20 minutes later and I'm thinking, &quot;wow, song #5 sure is long.&quot;  Seriously, I had to check my CD player to make sure it wasn't just repeating the same song over and over because, like several have stated, they all sound the same!<br />I'll still play the CD but I doubt I'll ever listen past My Immortal again.  Everything else sounds like just filler.  Evanescence will need to really dig deep if they want to last more than their 15 alloted minutes of fame.
0156029065|3.0|This book is the life story of Baudolino as told by the title character. It should be noted that Baudolino is a great story teller and a known liar. As Eco ties in many historical and fantasy figures into Baudolino's life the reader is never sure what is the truth and what is not. As a whole the story was great. Having never read one of Eco's books before I was not sure what I was getting into. I found parts of the story a struggle to get through. However, the book was worth sticking to and the ending was very good. If you are a fan of Eco's books you will enjoy this story. If you have never read one of Eco's book I do not think I would recommend this as a first taste.
