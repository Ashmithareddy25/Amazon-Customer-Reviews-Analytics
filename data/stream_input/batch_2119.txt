0143034901|5.0|This is now among my favorite books. This is a beautifully written novel that has it all: mystery, humor, drama, magical realism. The character and plot development is enchanting, and the end of it all I felt I had been in Barcelona and met these people- and my husband would probably agree based on the way I talked about it. 450+ pages that I could not stop turning!
B000OVLINI|4.0|I was ambivalent about my choice of 4 stars for this well written and well concieved novel. I was tempted to give it 3 stars, but for the excellent writing and construction of the story. Though a translation from the Spanish, the author took great pains to delineate the principal characters, the process was a long time in the development..<br /><br />The book was highly recommended by my grandson and perhaps was the reason I persisted through the early development of the story..  I was reminded of Les Miserable with the relentless pursuit of the protagonist by the evil former childhood friend of the hero, now a maverick military officer, and of loves lost, found and lost again.<br /><br />The setting, in Barcelona, principally in the 1930''s, was detailed, dramatic and evocative of the city ambience for  those who might have had the joy of experienceing it.  There's a lot of death, dying, cold rain and  unrequited love which isn't entirely resolved in the deneaumont.  Still most of the loose ends are tied up in the last chapter which leaves the reader with a better sense of justification for the pain and agony preceeding the ending.<br /><br />It's a long read, well written with well developed characterizations and  plot,  But not a happy story.

B00425S1H8|5.0|This is a good adaptor to buy if you need true USB to serial, or RS 232 adaptor. Works with Windows XP, 7, Linux 2.6 kernel, and Mac. Of course it is going to require a \\"driver\\" of sorts, but those are readily available for free. If you have any problems at all, especially with Windows, research how to free unused ports... With linux lsof is your friend :)<br /><br />I recommend this product for most applications, I have had no problems what so ever with it on any OS...

B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I bought this CD for my mom and she just loves it! She liked all the songs from the movie and was glad to see that they were put onto CD. It was a great gift for a fan of the movie.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|To see Gatsby tortured by love and to shape his life for it.  When he demands before kissing her that he will not be her lover, but as a husband!  Ahhhh line me up!  Where can I find a man like that?
B000SOYEQY|5.0|Based on the life and times of T.E. Lawrence, the movie defines how some of the turmoil in the Middle East came to pass after WW I. Lawrence is a British officer more in love with the desert than the army or his homeland. He convinces his superiors to let him act as a sole agent to unite the many Arab tribes against the Ottoman Empire's Turkish army, which is allied with Germany.<br />Much of it was shot on location in Jordan, scene of some of his exploits. Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, and Omar Sharif are convincing Arab rulers; Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains keep stiff upper lips, and Jose Ferrer is terrifying as a sadistic Turkish officer who humiliates and reduces Lawrence to hatred during perverted torture. It took 2 years to shoot the film, time which Peter O'Toole must have spent studying the one he portrayed. He captures Lawrence's mannerisms, expressions, and words as they probably happened. The sequence of the Arab rulers at each other's throats after defeating the Turks and Prince Feisal making backroom deals directly with the British foreshadow a Middle East free from the Ottoman Empire but dependent on the British Empire and later most of the world dependent on the region for its vast supplies of oil.<br />If you get a chance catch a showing on a big theatre screen, which alone can capture the grandeur of the locales that were transformed as the entire region was chopped up into the present day countries.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire HD and I like the different levels that  the game has. I like to play while riding in the car.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really liked the book !! It made me understand people that my be depressed and have problems and my need help!!

B00846F1YW|2.0|New for me so I haven't decided yet.<br />Not sure how you pinch and zoom, because that won't work for me?
B004KWVDWI|4.0|The French have long meted out justice in strange ways, such as use of guillotines, service in the Foreign Legion, or banishment to penal colonies. Based on the account of a prisoner who escaped Devil's Island, Papillon graphically details life and death in one such colony.<br />McQueen was notorious for being top dog in the movies in which he starred, one account claims that he counted the words of dialogue granted co-star Paul Newman in the Towering Inferno and demanded the script be rewritten to give him more words in the movie. Perhaps that explains co-star Dustin Hoffman's low key performance in Papillon. He never attempts to upstage McQueen but his subtle acting is a perfect counterfoil to McQueen's bigger than life portrayal. They represent the two most common reactions most humans have towards life: passive acceptance or I'm doing it my way no matter what.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wonderful story of survival with lots of interesting zoological facts thrown in.  The main character is examining 'self' in a profound way before the adventure begins and then continues it somewhat on his journey back to life.  Wonderfully written and I actually felt thirsty and hungry at some points in the book along with the main character.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|So far, so good. Seems to be working just great and is not hard to use. It will be nice to have songs to listen to when wanted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is an amaze.If you buy this app you will love it.so buy it today and you'd kids will love it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great Book, excited for the other 2 movies to come out however the first wasn't nearly as good as the book.
B008B92U32|1.0|On Galaxy Nexus: I tried it on several different images. It has no smart technology, you have to manually edit everything .If  I wanted to manually make all of the adjustments, I'd just use a phone photoshop-like tool. False billing? No, but definitely not good. Don't waste your money.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I liked the movie, it was pretty much worth watching for the darn cure little minions and the quote, &#34;It's so Fluffy I'm gonna die!&#34;
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The program is an excellent story and is an adventure to look forward too. I hope that season three will come soon.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Very cute movie. The kids 11 & 15 both enjoyed it as well. Adam Sandler does a good job as the voice ok Drac.

B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|The factual reality was excellent filling in the blanks to an event we read about but knew nothing of the actual excecution. Well cast, well acted and well directed.
B000GGSMB2|1.0|So the mocie was wrapped up, looked as if it was brand new, until i opened the case, both disks were scratched, and it prevented the movie from playing. i was and still am disappointed.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this book, and series, to anyone that enjoys a good story and has ever felt passionately about something important to them.
B00642ZOIG|4.0|As with any book by Michael Crichton the research, on which this book is based, is impressive. The conspiracy that underpins the plot is all too familiar.  Likewise, the details of its impact on the unsuspecting scientists caught in the web of deceit is disturbingly plausible.  The environmental descriptions turn the familiar into an alien terrain repleat with exotic predators. Excellent character development enhances the tension. I haven't given the book five stars as there were a times where I found credibility stretched a bit too far by the 'convenience' of some events.  Overall, it falls a wee bit short of what I have come to expect from a Michael Crichton novel. Nevertheless, it is a good read.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Well produced staying in the James Bond janre. I look forward to the next adventure. Watching it in my home added to the enjoyment
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book ever that I have ever read in my life . It was really awesome and cool. Plain out awesome.
B005721W9O|4.0|If you liked Star Trek and you like Tim Allen, then you will enjoy this movie.  Typical on purpose over acting because it is a comedy spoof.  Standard plot, good guys win, bad guys eventually lose, typical Star Trek, all is well that ends well movie.  My older kids liked the sarcasm (15 year old), my 7 year old asked too many questions but still liked it, my 5 year old was lost.  Haha... but again she's five.  Good luck.  There is a little skin, in your face bikini type exposure,  and they did iuse the &#34;boob&#34; word, but it didn't bother me just my wife!
B008J05EL8|2.0|I do not use it the App in no way helps my applications and I ,a student, Had to purchase University 365 Microsoft office in order to apply the schools programs. Sorry, M.S. Inc. I'm asking for a refund amazon...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this book, and series, to anyone that enjoys a good story and has ever felt passionately about something important to them.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|The last 15 minutes of the first DVD with only Renee Fleming singing was brilliant and brought tears to my eyes. Well worth the cost of the DVD alone. The DVD as a whole was greater than expectations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm only reviewing this because it said please so I really like this game and It's a good time waster like when I should be doing homework like rout now.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I own a few other watches but this is my first diver style watch as well as my first Seiko.<br /><br />First impressions were very good, it came packaged in a nice blue box and was clasped around a white pillow. Of course you can read all the dimensions and weight in the product description, but this is what I'd consider a well proportioned timepiece. It doesn't look overly large or gaudy like many other divers on the market, and feels substantial without being uncomfortably heavy.<br /><br />It's a quartz movement so obviously nothing bad to say about the accuracy of the watch. A solid piece for a good price. If you like what you see in the pictures I'd recommend picking one up.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app helped clean my kindle fire of all the useless carp that was stored in here. So if you want your device to be fast and runable, then but this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is fun and very addicting. The colors are HD and clear. I recommend it to anyone who liked temple run.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was so good the whole series and the last book especially. I wish there was more and i didn't sleep for a week cuz of it.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I absolutely love this series, always wondering what Don would do in any given situation.  Just wish they were longer...........alas.  When is season 6 available??  My evening entertainment just got boring again.
B004H4XLR4|5.0|i bought this for my son, he is 5. He is car's fan and love this jet very much. he can put in this transporter 2 or 3 cars and make them fly.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Last year my daughter was crazy about this group. She inisted any more so she let her friend borrow it. Her friend loved it so much she didn't want to give it back so my daughter said she could keep it for a Christmas present. She was thrilled.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Topical (human trafficking) action packed (like a Bourne movie) and family values (if kicking a** to save your daughter qualifies) this movie has it all.  I also didn't know that the closing credits are where the Alex Clare song &#34;Too Close&#34; got its break, but that's a great reason to stick around.  If you're looking for dramatic depth and all that junk, go look at some Oscar nominated schlock.<br /><br />I watched this for the first time last weekend (2013) long after its release and I had missed it.  We did a double feature with Taken 2, and the combo was great. Action packed, emotionally gripping, great work all around, and just enough pathos to be more than pure popcorn.  This is what a topical movie can do for an issue, with all the logical issues stripped out.  Don't fight it, enjoy it.
B00154GEFU|5.0|This is what what I had hoped for after years of missing the original members.  It is Asia grown up.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This video really opened my eyes to what is really going on in the food industry. It's quite shocking and I will never eat any animal product from any fast food resteraunt again ever, nor from anywhere else even because I like eating Vegan style except the only dairy product I eat is butter, so until I find a good alternative for butter that tastes good, that's the only thing I'm eatting that isn't Vegan.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The movie spends way too much time trying to link itself to the other Bourne movies.  That link is very thin, and could have been explained in a simple fashion with about 3 lines of dialogue.  Instead, they make oblique references to Jason Bourne and the Treadstone project and fill the screen with cameos of actors from the first films.  That time would have been far better spent developing a plot for Jeremy Renner's character--or at least clarifying the scant plot they had.  Too confusing, with too many characters that you never get to know enough to like or hate.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I enjoy hidden object games with a storyline.  This game is fun so far, waiting to see how it ends.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I was hooked after the very first show I am now into the third season can't wait to see what happens next.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Great movie for the kids and not bad for the adults either. I haven't watched the 3D version yet because I just got in today, but I am looking forward to it. I have a new Samsung Smart TV that has the best 3D I have seen and I am sure this movie will look great. Our grandchildren love it and it gives the grandparents a break.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|I bought this at the same time as Phoenix.  This was a little disappointing in comparison to Phoenix.  It's still worth getting.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. It had suspense and humor. If you have ever had or have a bad boss, you will enjoy this movie. I did.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I tried to watch some missed shows on Fox, it played more than half and then the picture cut off. That sucked. This was just like playing a DVD, but it's right here ready to play.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I don't have Showtime and therefore had not had the opportunity to see Dexter until recently. At the recommendation of a friend, I purchased and watched the pilot episode and I was hooked! I wasted no time ordering the entire season immediately after! I am halfway through season 1 in about 5 days time and fully intend to purchase the remaining seasons as I get to them. If you love murder mysteries, detective or police dramas, forensic themes or anything along those lines, this is a must see! There is however some adult language and themes including sexual scenes and graphic mutilation so it's not one for the kiddies but it is gripping adult entertainment. Do yourself a favor and get caught up in this one!
0792164903|5.0|This DVD goes along with my  literature class and the students really enjoy watching it around Halloween. WIll be used extensively.
0316228532|1.0|I finally finished Rowling's \\"the Casual Vacancy\\".<br /><br />I was not impressed, rather I was revolted.  To me it was an evil, LITTLE book lacking in any credibility or reality.  I am sure that there are situations where only negativity reigns supreme, but there should be at least one shining light of sanity and goodness.  Not one speck appeared to me in this very bad read.  The only person who seemed to have any died in the first couple of pages, so Barry didn't count.<br /><br />It was about ego, innuendo, lies, bullying, inadequacy, selfishness, indifference, gossip, narrow mindedness - all presented in a very disjointed manner.  The breakdown of family values was evident not just because of the youth, but interactions through all generations.  Sadly pathetic really.<br /><br />Because of the short almost voyeur like sequences no plot or point seemed to emerge until the last few pages and then it was about hopeless despair.<br /><br />Even her research was incorrect, she had Tessa injecting insulin for type 2 diabetes, should have been type 1.<br /><br />I figure if this is her view of the British people she is in deep trouble.  Hopefully her next effort will be better, but it will take a lot to persuade me to pick up another adult book by her.  Short of like the person who wrote \\"the clan of the cave bear\\" went downhill from there.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old and 6 month old (when she's old enough).  It is enjoyable to watch with her.  Shaun is funny, and cleaver in solving problems.  We look forward to the next season.  If you like Shaun the Sheep, stick with the seasons.  The other videos all come from the seasons.  This is created by Nick Park, the same person that created Wallace and Gromit.  He also created a Timmy Time for younger viewers.  Shaun the Sheep is my daughter's favourite of the three.  We look forward to season three coming out.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|I bought this DVD to complete my Transformers collection.  I was a little disapointed that they had to replace Megan Fox due to problems she had with director/producer,???. The new girl was cute and OK, but it would have been better with Megan.  That's the problem with sequels, some of the main characters in the 1st one are sometimes replaced and changes the whole aspect of the movie.<br /><br />It like changing Bruce Willis in the Die Hard movies or Michael J Fox in the Back to the Future movies, they wouldn'i have been the same..
B004LROUNG|4.0|I'm a prolific reader and have had a hard time in recent months finding a book that kept my attention. John's new book has done that for me, mainly through character development. Although I wouldn't term this a barn burning book that you can't put down, it does grab your attention as you get to know that characters and plot. Another good read from Mr. Grisham.
B000YDI9UG|4.0|Great boot, runs a size big, and slightly wide.  You can be safe to order at least a size down.  Very light and comfortable.  Recommend.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Enjoyed this DVD at home. Its a great DVD with lots of action and well written. I have watched it over and over and will continue to do so.
B001AH6ZWY|3.0|The movie is not bad, there's been movies made from books which have ended up much worst, and It has a great cast<br />With that being said, I was disappointed that they didn't' stick to the original story more than they did.  I think this would have been a much better movie if they had done that.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was better than I expected. It was $0.00, so I didnt have high hopes. But I loved the characters. They were very likeable. Refreshing with just a little bit of sexiness. This is perfect for a Saturday afternoon read. I would definately recommend this book.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It had Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, and best of all, Olivia Wilde.  It was a little far fetched, but I still liked the movie.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I was disappointed with this book, With the cast of characters listed in the movie I thought this would be a great book.<br />I found that the story lines jump all over the place and found that the characters did not tie together.  Will not see the movie now.
B006VREHRS|4.0|Boardwalk Empire is a really great show, takes a look at Atlantic City during prohibition and women's suffrage. This show will hook you fast and even though Season 1 isn't quite as intense, 2 and especially 3 will have you begging for another season!
B001XUPGLY|4.0|I've always enjoyed this movie. Let's face it, Kirk is and always will be the only true captain of the Enterprise. This movie has always been my favorite though. With the time travel, bringing new and old technology together and seeing some of San Francisco, which always reminds me of home, this is a good feeling flick. I know the aquarium scenes were filmed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which is a beautiful aquarium.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|A very good way to finish this, love. what Is next for the Cullen clan,will the story continue. There NEEDS to be a better finus to this wonderful saga. Keep up the good work!
B0086700CM|5.0|I want to give it zero stars because it takes away a lot of my free time because once I start playing, it's always &quot;OK, just one more game!&quot;
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I am sooo hooked on this series! SO gritty, and brutal but tongue in check humor as well.  Jax is hot, Gemma will get hers and hopefully so will Clay.  Was SO shocked when Opie got killed!  Can't wait for the new season....tick tock...
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game it shows the fun way to make a city and you can make it your own I love it
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great show, it's hard to resist watching 2 or 3 episodes in one sitting. A lot of nudity and sex (it's HBO) so I wouldn't watch it with your kids or grandparents.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thought it was a really good book.  The author handled a tough subject in a very sensitive way.  The story was told from an interesting perspective.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|ok... this movie wasn't what it said it was. I would have preferred to decline the show had I known what it was really about. Without giving away the plot pay close attention to the area where it says alcohol.<br />The first 20 minutes or so were ok then, it was all down hill. It is in my opinion that this is not one of Denzel's better roles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this fun it teaches you the right way to take care of a horse and it gives you something to do when you just love horses and it to wet and you can't get out and play your own horses
B002N44XSG|4.0|It's wonderful and well planned I really do love it! Rick I  by far the best  writer out there! Go.Percy!
B008GFI3QE|1.0|A nice tribute to a talented producer. Most of his fans would be interested to know about his life when his talent rose up in his pre-Judy period. His history is so scripted by his image managers (Judy and Giles) that there is nothing left to learn from about 1964 on. No real history of his first family, especially his brilliant, talented, and handsome actor and producer son Gregory Martin or his lovely daughter Alexis. No one wants to here anymore from Giles who has absolutely zero talent. The Beatles \\"Love\\" is rubbish!
B009LRE040|2.0|I regret buying this movie. Everyone said it was great but I was bored the whole time. I'm a fan of the old TIm Burton Batmans so if you're into those also this one won't measure up.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|oI loved the book could not stop reading it I enjoyed every page and will read it again thank you.
B00136JQMI|5.0|I am a jazz novice, but can easily understand the importance of this album.  The legend plays with Coltrane on a sublime album.  Top quality jazz and trumpet play.  If you lover jazz, you already have this.  If you are looking to get into jazz, this is a great place to start.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down!!! Easy to read and the ending will have you in tears! By far one of my favorites:)
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|good story, but the game is kind of short. would like tohave seen more hidden object games. The puzzles were fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Myself and my husband thoughly enjoyed this series. We only wish there were more episodes. Love the historical views and scenes in Europe.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I'm a really picky critic and this series is thrilling! A great look at the 1920s and Atlantic city during prohibition.
B008GWSS6W|4.0|Love it very funny, loved the fight scene and and the heart to heart talk he has with his daughter
B001KP0AKY|5.0|The man, John Coltrane, on the top of his game.  If this isn't the best Coltrane album, it is just under Love Supreme.  Superb sax play that you would expect.  Soulful, elegant and a jazz album to be played over and over again.  Highly recommended.
B003VXOFEU|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift, and the receiver was thrilled wih it.  It was just what was needed.

0374533571|3.0|This book was quirky, as I think the movie was supposed to be, and a fast read.  However, I don't think it was at all realistic and kind of silly.  At first, the main character, Pat Peoples, who has been in a mental institution, \\"the bad place\\", has an almost infantile way of talking and behaving.<br /> By the end of the book, he's cured and entering a relationship with a recovered mentally ill woman.  It's not the mental illness, it's the way the book was written, that irks me.<br />So many things are too cliche'd.  For instance, Pat becomes friends with his therapist, Cliff, an Indian man.  But not in the office-- oh, no-- at Philadelphia Eagles games that they find kinship together.  And, while he is in \\"apart time\\",meaning separation, from his wife (he thinks they're still married), he befriends Tiffany, the recovered mentally ill woman, and becomes a star dancer under her tutelage.<br />  Tiffany also befriends Pat's mother, who has no other friends, and is dealing with a difficult husband.If the Eagles don't win a game, he retires to his study and won't speak to anyone. And on and on.  I don't think I'll see the movie.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Most of us have a pretty solid grip on history. Slavery was evil. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution which ended slavery was most excellent, and you would most certainly have voted for it. And Lincoln was a great guy as can be seen by the fact that he is on mineral and paper money.<br /><br />One of the marvelous things Steven Spielberg's film, Lincoln, does is show how difficult some of these choices were a century and a half ago. In April of 1864, the US Senate passed the 13th Amendment with relative ease. The passage of the amendment through the House of Representatives, which was much more of a struggle, is the focus of the film's action.<br /><br />I choose the word \\"action\\" carefully. If your knowledge of legislation comes from Schoolhouse Rock's \\"I'm Just a Bill,\\" you might be surprised by the intrigue, drama and humor that screenwriter Tony Kushner draws from public debate and backroom deals. We're not presented with clear white and black (or blue and grey) hats to root for or against. We see good, wise and, yes, Christian men pitted in opposition.<br /><br />Many Republican Representatives looked to Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) for direction. Blair was concerned that passage of the amendment would endanger peace talks. As great an evil slavery was, he believed, war was a greater evil. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a leader of the abolitionist movement, had to downplay the scope and consequences of the legislation to help it pass. This galled the abolitionists, and was even more offensive to those of African descent.<br /><br />Other Christian men, primarily Democrats, believed that slavery itself wasn't evil, but was sanctioned by Scripture. Godly men (and women, but they couldn't vote) claimed to seek God's will on the issue of slavery and came to opposing positions. They didn't have history's hindsight to know what position would have the 21st century stamp of approval.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln admitted as much, even in the midst of the great Civil War. In an 1862 memorandum, he wrote, \\"In great contests, each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time.\\" Throughout the film we see Lincoln (portrayed brilliantly by Daniel Day-Lewis) fighting, sometime even underhandedly, for what he believes is right, all the while acknowledging that he might not be right. He acts boldly, yet with great humility.<br /><br />If Lincoln could show so much humility in the issues of slavery, war and suffrage, perhaps we can show some humility when it comes to such issues as abortion, marriage, and immigration. There are great dangers we face as Christians, and especially as a church, when we delve into issues the world views as political.<br /><br />Jesus confronted one such danger when approached on tax policy (Matthew 22: 17 - 21). Jesus said some realms belonged to God and some to Caesar. We need to discern which things are sacred and which are secular, but we must avoid two other great dangers: we must not ascribe ignorance, evil or incompetence to others, just because they disagree with our moral or political points of view, and we must not abandon great issues to the world just because they are controversial.<br /><br />The church played a great role in ending legal slavery in the Western World (don't think slavery itself is dead). The church helped secure civil rights and fought racial prejudice. There are many other moral battles that must be waged, but we must walk in the Lord's footsteps, being as wise as serpents, yet as gentle as doves.<br /><br />(Lincoln is rated PG-13 for graphic battlefield violence and vulgar language, some of it escaping the lips of the 16th President.)e great Civil War.

B007V9YF5E|2.0|I really like and admire Gina Carrano, and I hate to pan this movie, but the directing and screenplay were both just so painfully bad that honesty compels me to do so. Gina Carrano tried her best, and she gives an entirely credible performance, especially considering her background is that of an MMA cage fighter, not an actress. But Steven Soderbergh was a very poor choice of a director for an action film. The Sitcom is his forte, and he apparently has no understanding of any other genre.<br /><br />The story is the same trite, cliche nonsense we have all seen 100 times before, &#34;secret agent set up and betrayed by her own agency, and now she's on the run and looking for revenge&#34;.<br /><br />The military uses the term &#34;blivet&#34; to mean 20 pounds of steer manure stuffed into a ten-pound bag, and that's a good description of this movie.

B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Okay so I've finally gotten a chance to write this review. Before we get into too much detail I have to say that I did \\"enjoy\\" this movie but not for many other reasons than the idea that it is in itself a handmade piece of artwork. (These are the folks who did the production for the Coraline movie and oh how well they do the animation for this; a majority of it is still classic stop motion and it's so awesome)! However, I don't really think it's a perfect movie. I'll tell you why...<br /><br />Plot: **POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Skip this if you haven't seen the whole movie!**<br />The plot is rather straightforward with a small cast of interesting characters. It's a very colorful story but it suffers from predictability. There's not much you can do with a story about a boy who's outcast from society other than to have him find a way to be accepted in the end, and there's not a lot you can do involving this cast of characters other than be completely torn between helping him or fighting against him. All of the elements of a standard children's movie are there and as an young adult (or even an older adult watching with your kids; I really think you should if this is the case), you'll find yourself rolling your eyes at the obvious hints of where the story direction goes. (Ie: The bully becomes a friend; Normal is eventually accepted by his family and society overall etc...). Not to diss on it, but the plot, because its so predictable, it just a little \\"meh\\" and lack luster. We've seen this done before but maybe the hand-made and some \\"mood\\" aspects of this may be the reason it is watchable, but not perfect. I'll talk about story content a little later, but to me, the older tone was remeniscent of a cross between an old Don Bluth animated film and a 1980s Chris Columbus film in animation form.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Paranorman provides us with a cast of interesting characters. Anyone you assume to be involved with this sort of story. We see a good array of folks you can relate to, (for the kids and maybe even for some adults; Norman stands the most prominent but he's a little droll to stand alone as a decent or interesting character). I feel like they really didn't do a whole lot with his powers (making them relevant to the story in some aspects) presenting him as maybe just a whiny outcast kid. However, a friend who Norman eventually makes, helps balance this out. Other characters (namely one) seemed just to be a background or one-shot character. (I think there's even one recurring background character who's supposed to be paying homage to the \\"Jim\\" character from the first season of The Walking Dead).<br /><br />Content:<br />With a movie like this (one related to Coraline) this movie is a little older. Honestly in some spots it feels like a PG-13 movie. It's definitely got some relatively (but not overly) graphic scenes (not blood and guts but definitely may be nightmare fuel for some younger audiences).<br /><br />Because its a movie dealing with the theme of \\"death\\" many parents may have some qualms about letting their kids watch this by themselves. Some parts that I found on-the-edge-of-your-seat, some children may find rather scary.<br /><br />There are some good morals mixed in with the action of this movie also. Underlying themes included seem to \\"shame\\" some of the people who may discriminate against people of certain life-choices or folks who seem different. BUT I applaud the movie creators for adding in the aspect of forgivness of those people who might be ignorant or scared about it, leaving us without a terribly preachy movie.<br /><br />Controversy Aspect:<br />Okay I've both dreaded the need to touch base on this one (and at the same time felt I needed to). Yes, one of the character's in this movie (Mitch: The Jock Character), does reveal himself to have a boyfriend at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Is it good exposure for the gay community... I say \\"maybe,\\" only because the way that it is revealed feels more satirical and \\"in your face\\" revelations.<br /><br />Even so, it's such a tiny, TINY portion of the movie that it's hardly worth the mention, however, some parents may find this (within a family movie especially) to be a little offensive. Even as a relatively conservative fellow myself, I feel that it is still pretty innocent though and I think so long as folks are aware of this little sucker punch they might be able to handle this a bit more calmly.<br /><br />Basically all it boils down to is, \\"it's just a joke,\\" folks and other than the reveal it doesn't shove it in your face as bad as some people think it might. There's a lot of other content in this movie that I would worry about BEFORE worrying about the inclusion of a \\"gay character.\\"<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Overall the movie is watchable. You'll find yourself feeling entertained by a movie that wants to pay homage to the older 70's-80's zombie and monster flicks while learning some good old fashioned moral values about the way we treat other people also. Have some fun with this one.<br /><br />Peace out!ical and \\"in your face\\" revelations.<br /><br />Even so, it's such a tiny, TINY portion of the movie that it's hardly worth the mention, however, some parents may find this (within a family movie especially) to be a little offensive.

B008FSCNTK|2.0|I once read an interview with Diana Krall in which she complained that interviewers too often want to talk about her looks.  With that in mind, what's the deal with the cover photo?  Is that photo of her in lingerie saying \\"Respect me as a musician\\"?  It would be a better cover for a CD called \\"Misogyny.\\"  This is what I would expect if The Onion did CD covers.<br /><br />In terms of the music, I always like jazz artists who try new things musically, and music on this CD is adventurous.  I wish they hadn't miked everything at such a distance (which I assume they did to give it an \\"old-timey\\" sound), but I guess that's part of the adventurous musicianship.  I prefer her Live in Paris, All for You, and Love Scenes.  Still, the music is good (in spots) here.<br /><br />However, she should stay away from the blues.  \\"I'm a Little Mixed Up\\" is really rough.

0307341550|3.0|Thanks to readingitforward.com, SHARP OBJECTS is the second book by Gillian Flynn that I've read. On the basis of having now read both this book and GONE GIRL, it appears to me that Flynn likes deeply flawed characters with psychological problems who have dysfunctional families. In SHARP OBJECTS, it seems EVERY character has flaws and at least one phychological problem. But the main character, Camille Preaker, beats them all.<br /><br />Preaker comes back to the small town where she grew up to report on a double murder there for the Chicago newspaper she works for. It seems everything she does involves alcohol. She drinks so much that it is unbelievable she can accomplish her investigative reporting duties. But investigate she does, always one step behind her policeman friend, Richard. And boy does she drink all the while!<br /><br />But the drinking isn't as bad as the cutting, I guess.<br /><br />While visiting her home town, Preaker stays with her mother, stepfather, and 13-year-old half sister. Here lies SHARP OBJECT's greatest mystery. It is Flynn's trick to make you make you feel undecided about these people throughout the book. Although it's easy to see they're dysfunctional, you won't know their true selves until the end. Please don't let any other book review tell you more about them and spoil that for you.<br /><br />That's as close to story summary as you'll get from me. I won't spoil it for you, as so many book reviews on the Internet have done to me.

0385342063|4.0|Sometimes I just need a break from serious literature--heart-wrenching tales of families torn apart by war, brave individuals rebuilding their lives in foreign lands, children struggling in abusive homes, love stories riddled with symbolism and metaphor--and want to settle in with a nice, easy Sophie Kinsella novel. I used to like her Shopaholic series but after a while I tired of the main character, who never seemed to learn from her mistakes or grow out of her insecurities and foibles. I've Got Your Number seems to fix a lot of those complaints, first because it's a brand new character (and not necessarily one who will have a series) and despite her fair share of foibles, she's much more assertive than Becky Bloomwood--aka The Shopaholic--ever was.<br /><br />That's not to say that Poppy Wyatt is completely in control of her own life, nor of her own insecurities. She's agreed to marry a man she's known only a few months, finding herself swept up in the fantasy of his good looks and his impressive family of academic celebrities. Even more impressive is the expensive family heirloom he's given her as an engagement ring--the ring that she has just lost on the very day she's supposed to meet his parents. The very day. To make matters worse, as she frantically calls everyone she can think of to get them to help her find her ring, her phone gets stolen, leaving her feeling incommunicado and desperate. As if by fate, she finds a discarded cell phone in the trash bin (but insists that it's not stealing since it was in the bin, an excuse she certainly would not have accepted if her ring had been found in a trash bin). She takes over the phone, giving the number to everyone she knows, but in the process she finds herself taking over the life of the previous owner of the phone, the personal assistant of an impatient business tycoon.<br /><br />I'm not someone who can relate to the desperate reliance on a cell phone. I don't carry my whole life in it by any means and I don't think I even know how to send a text message. In fact, my partner and I share a phone that we barely use, except to call each other when one is at home and the other is not. But I'm sure I'm in a very small minority there. Nonetheless, Sophie Kinsella did a perfect job of creating a character who could not live without a phone, even for a moment, and she got the balance just right. She included phone messages, texts and emails in the body of the novel without letting them take over completely. This was not The Twitter Diaries, by any means. It's more like Bridget Jones if she spent the whole novel on the phone.think I even know how to send a text message.

0374214913|2.0|I disliked this book in the same way I disliked Microserfs. Which is to say, if you are reading this you will probably like it just fine. I've noticed that most people who've read this book--just like most people who read Microserfs--loved it. Not me, however. I'll see if I can explain why.<br /><br />It's not that I hated it. It just didn't grab me. I think i was supposed to be drawn in by the \\"coolness\\" of the techie characters with their Macs and their jobs at Google. Or maybe I was meant to be amused by the quaintness of the eccentric bookstore. Or intrigued by the \\"mystery\\" of the store's late-night customers.<br /><br />But I just couldn't get myself to care enough. The characters didn't ring true as real people so much as collections of references to remind you of the exact year (and month?) the book was written.<br />Since this wasn't a review copy (I just got it from the library) I sped through the second half of it and moved on to other books.<br /><br />Oh, but if you get the hardcover edition (not the ebook) the cover glows in the dark!

Put together a new Windows 8 64 bit machine, and my old usb to serial adapter would no longer work.<br />Package came with version 1.6 of the driver, but website had version 1.7, so I used that.<br />Installed, plugged in, it worked. Tested the machine, data flowed fine at top speed it is capable of.<br />What more can I say?

1616550414|4.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said about this book?  If you like Zelda; get it.  Simple.  The hardcore fans will really enjoy the new official timeline for the games, and the casual fans will get a kick out of the artwork and developer commentary.  Nintendo surprisingly delivered on their promise of never before seen concept art, which is what I wanted out of the purchase.  If you're like me and get a kick out of conceptual artwork... there's plenty of it.  Though be warned that most of the section is devoted to newer entries in the series.  (Skyward Sword / Twilight Princess / Phantom Hourglass / etc)<br /><br />The book deserves 5 stars, but I had to dock a star for the condition it arrived in.  (I know.  I know.  The reviews are for the product themselves... but I feel a little slighted here.)  The packaging was in great condition but there was a huge chunk taken out of the top left corner of the cover/binding.<br /><br />Yours will probably arrive in great condition.  Don't hesitate.  Buy it!

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I have read several Navy Seal related books lately and this is probably the best written of the ones I have read.  Although there was much controversy about publishing this book (classified information, etc). After reading it, it is easy to see that the information was available elsewhere, except the author's personal perspective. This is a good supplement to the movie &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; - each begins at a different point, one from the sacrifice of the intelligence community (which the author justly praises) and the other from the sacrifice of the Special Ops community - then each converges to the historic event of the death of the worlds most wanted terrorist.
B0051T46XM|1.0|I didn't know the movie was not in English. The picture quality was slightly better than a DVD. Looks like a cheap production filmed with a handcorder. Nothing suspenseful about the movie. Save your money on this one!

B005WUHAX8|2.0|I was SO excited about receiving this phone case for my iphone 4. My sister told me that it was a phenomenal case protection wise & that it was even water proof! (I have small children, so I was looking for a phone case with optimal protection against anything & everything!) So, not only did I spend the money ordering one for myself, but I went ahead & purchased one for my husband as well.<br /><br />I recieved the phone case. It was pretty. & It was NOT a knock-off. It was a real genuine life proof. I proceeded to follow the company's instructions as to how to put it on & protect it against water damage....I liked the way the case looked. & the fact that it was pink. BUT, THAT WAS IT!!!<br /><br />After just a couple gentle drops inside my home, the top corners had already cracked & started chipping like crazy! & it looked horrible.<br /><br />The second thing, was that my silent button was non-operable with the case on my phone. SO annoying! The buttons that still did actually work were SO hard to push. I has to use a TON of pressure just to turn the volume up or down, or lock the screen.<br /><br />The third thing that makes this case a waste of money: I LOVE to use my speakerphone! At home, while driving, all the time! With this case, I was unable to use speakerphone. The person on the other end of the line couldn't hear me at all. (My voice was horribly muffled & would also echo!!) also, not only could the person I was speaking with hear my voice echo, but so could I!<br /><br />After a couple weeks, the door that opens & closes for your charger cable to be put in & taken out completely snapped off.<br />(Just from normal opening & closing!!)<br /><br />This phone case is expensive! (Especially for being such a worthless piece of JUNK!!) save your MONEY! & don't even go this route!<br /><br />I just purchased myself a pink camouflage otterbox defender & I absolutely LOVE it! (&, it was cheaper than this Lifeproof!!)<br /><br />I will add though: that my husbandstill has his, uses his. & love it! His, oddly enough, has not tore up or anything. & ALL the buttons are operable thru the cover! (Bizarre, I know!) he has the black Lifeproof, if that makes any difference at all.<br /><br />Good luck guys! & go with the Otterbox defender if you want a good iPhone case!! :)

1457514508|3.0|I have to admit that The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead is an interesting read.  Had I seen this short novel in a bookstore, the title and the cover art might have dissuaded me from even picking up the book let alone reading it.  However, I did read it, and I have to admit that it was an interesting read with a somewhat surprising read.<br /><br />The book's action takes place in Savannah, Georgia with a significant detour to Paris, France.  Gordonston is a mid to upper class neighborhood that serves as a bedroom community for Savannah.  Most of the primary characters are of retirement age but the community they live in does have younger families.  We know this because of the Girl Scout cabin in the center of the neighborhood park and the play area referred to a number of times.<br /><br />Cindy, Carla, Heidi, and Thelma are the dog-walking club.  Thelma we never really meet since she has an advanced case of cancer and is never a part of the story.  It is the interplay of these three older women that drives most of the story.  Tom and Kelly, a young couple that are relatively newly married and Doug and Veronica, also, a young couple, add to the set of characters.  Elliot, Thelma's husband, and Mr. Jackson, round out the cast.  Whitehead has a talent of developing interesting characters.  The entire novel is only 189 pages (my copy) and in that short space he has developed nine fully developed characters.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a word for word repeat of an early chapter near the end of the story.  I'm not sure the reason this was allowed to happen.  I have seen movies that replay an early scene at the climax of the movie, which is what Whitehead has apparently done.  While effective in a movie realm, it only mystifies the reader and, at least in this case, caused a slight episode of frustration.<br /><br />I also found the novel very wordy in places.  It's apparent that additional editing would have helped the story along.  Again, at only 189 pages, there are many places that the story could have been effectively expanded had page count been a consideration.<br /><br />I suspect that we will see additional novels based in Gordonston.  This prediction is made because so many tidbits regarding the characters were introduced and then just left out on the floor.  Just a random thought!<br /><br />Given these two negative issues, I still consider that a worthwhile read.<br /><br />I recommend Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, a pretty good beach read.<br /><br />( I was provided a free copy of this book but in no way influenced this review)story along.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I got these to plug into a new tv, so as to not bother the neighbors or roommate. They are plugged into an stereo headphone extension cord (6 ft.). The sound is excellent. They are lightweight and fit in the ear perfectly. Very clever design. Work much better that the regular ear buds, especially for people with smaller ear holes.<br /><br />Very please, getting another pair for laptop, came in a timely manner.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I found a reference to this book as I was researching Guernsey in anticipation of a trip there later this year. It sounded so intriguing, I ordered the kindle edition in order to \\"get to it\\" as soon as possible. I could not put the book down until I finished it. It is beautifully and creatively written, with remarkable characters. As an author, I strive to create characters that become real to the reader, and the people who populate this book certainly meet this criteria. Although usually not a fan of the use of a collection of letters to tell a story, this was so well composed, the letters so captivating, it was the best method of telling the story. The wit is such that I laughed out loud many times as I read. The history of German occupation of the Islands was unknown to me, and very informative. I immediately told my daughters about this book, after only reading a few pages, knowing how much they love good writing. I will travel to Guernsey already feeling I know the countryside and the people.<br /><br />I feel extremely lucky that I found this author (and the relative that completed it when she became ill).
B001NLKT60|5.0|Lisbeth Salander has to be one of fiction's strangest characters.  This book shows how her terrible childhood formed her.  The book was fast paced for the most part (except the mathematical bits which annoyed me).  Even the villians of the piece were well-rounded characters.  If the author was still alive, I would advise him to tone down the sex scenes with Blomkvist.  It beggars belief that he gets all these shapely and intelligent women into bed.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Arrived promptly and in good conditions. Had amazing action scenes and would recomend. If it was my choice i would change the main girl for someone hot and have a better plot. Other than that its amazing to see these old guys together again.  Thank you Amazon.

0307279189|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book and if I wasn't a certified couch potato, might've even taken up running after reading how running affected their lives. I was saddened to see that one of the main characters died not too long ago. The people in the book were not your every day joggers - running or personality wise.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Arrived promptly and in good conditions.  Didn't know what i was getting into... i normally just jog as a work out and recently needed a change... bought this and its a good workout.

Been a week and im still enjoying this dvd.

I reccomend this game to anyone who loves the I spy books, because the rooms where you have to find the items are pretty much the houses of borders:) its awesome because I COULD NOT wait for this app to be the free app of the day! I played the first one, but now I did not have to pay for this one because it is the free app of the day today!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I had never seen a single episode of Fringe and thought I would check out episode 1 season 1 on my Kindle Fire HD. I was hooked from the start. The acting is better than I expected and every episode is unique and enjoyable. I am now on episode 19 of season, and cannot wait to see the season finale. I recommend you give this show a shot, and hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I am looking forward to watching season 2 and 3 as well.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I read reviews about the first mysteryville and was quite disturbed at the remarks. In this version I found they still have touch sensitive problems.  ex: Just going to move the screen or zoom in ...a red x shows up as I did wrong and touched the wrong item when I was only moving the screen around or zooming.  Every touch that is not an item on list will be taken wrong.<br />The characters dress and speech was just off to me. Outdated for sure. Sorry but I'm just not impressed with it.<br />Florida Mom

One of the more engaging books set in during the modern conflicts in Iraq and/or Afghanitan.  This is not a technical book on sniper skills, nor is there as much mission detail as I would have hoped for (I imagine much may have been removed to get permission to publish).

B005GG0MIS|5.0|From finding out how important Herbert Hoover was to the Truman administration to how Clinton took valuable advise from Nixon this book delivers little known and fascinating facts about the role of past presidents.  This is a history and political junkies dream book.

B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Ok, first of all this game is good enough for me to go out of my way and write a review, which is going to be a recommendation.<br /><br />The game has a great arts style kind of like a Rayman Origins or Paper Mario, is like a painting or some sorts which goes very well with the dream theme.<br /><br />The music is just amazing (I'm playing it on an HTC One X+, which has Beats audio) and is a great sountrack, again it compliments the theme, is kind of medieval folk, dream adventure music, for the gamers out there is almost the same as TRINE 2. Outstanding music!<br /><br />Finally the gameplay, it is the same principle of Lemmins and BRAID which is to guide the kid who is a sleepwalker safely to bed while collecting stars and moons. How do you do that? Well, you have to move platforms, ramps and other things to the kid make it across. Now this is where the words &quot;FRANTIC&quot; comes to play, because even though the music is calming and relaxing and so does the artstyle, the kid goes from left to right non-stop in a fairly normal speed (for this kind of games) but the levels designs makes you be on your toes and be aware of which platforms you need to move fast or slower to make surw you get the last start and moon. It also has a REWINS button which you can use if you fall or hit the kid's head but at the cost of &quot;losing time&quot; which you are pitted against since you have a time clock that if you don't make it to bed in time the kid wakes up and you will have to restart the level.<br /><br />Is well worth the asking price and today is FREE and for that entry fee is super worth it. And if you are outside the FREE APP OF THE DAY window well pleasw support the developer and buy it. Is as much a bottle of water or a soda and you will help a great person or studio.<br /><br />Thank you for reading and I hope this review is helpful for each and everyone of you.

B009VB97EY|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but was completely disappointed.<br /><br />The dancing scenes are few and far between, and the storyline sucks. If someone offered me this film for free, I would decline.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to watch, keep looking.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|very creative, new controls,new characters.I don't know what to think of next, but this version will sure keep you entertained
B0058YPL66|5.0|I decided to start watching when a friend recommended!  I was hooked from the pilot and finished all 22 episodes of Season 1 in 8 days.  Towards the end, I invited my 16 year old to sit and watch with me one afternoon when he was bored.  He said OK, but was texting on his phone as he sat down.  I peeked over and found him watching the show, then becoming thoroughly entranced.  I gave him the backstory over dinner that night and he was asking questions about who the characters were, the stories, how they interacted, etc.  Of course, never in a million years would he tell his friends he likes or watches it.  After finished on Netflix, I had to stream from Amazon the Season 2 premiere (had to find out!!!) and watch on the PC.  DS came back to the office to watch with me, so I knew he was a goner, too!  It's not often I can find things we are both interested in!  Thanks Once Upon a Time!  I love the beautiful characters, great sexy costumes and makeup!  I love the different takes on the fairytales.
B00846F1YW|4.0|fun game. nice graphics.  enjoyed playing game. sometimes difficult to manipulate the objects one is supposed to use. otherwise, quite nice.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app makes reading my favorite books a breeze. It's on my top 10 list of all time favorite apps.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Any one who likes the movie needs to read this book. It is enjoyable and any one can read it.
1250027624|5.0|Love this book as it gives info on all the characters of the series Downton Abbey.  The photos are wonderful.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Not sure why it's up for an Academy. The movie was good, but not great. There are better options out there for the award.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|The trailers of this video made me want to see it, and now that I've seen it, I'd like to watch it a second time. I'm a huge fan of horror films, and this one has everything that makes them great. Something evil, a scary child, and much more.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the big battle scene. The movie spent so much time building up to the battle that I felt they could have spent more time actually battling the evil.<br /><br />If you like horror films, this is one you should see.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I am not much of a reader but I really enjoyed this novel. Emma Donoghue does a great job of getting inside the mind of a 5-year-old.
0062238310|5.0|I have a hard time understanding British accents and sometimes some of the actors mumble their words.  This book was an immense help in catching up on dialog.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I feel like Hazel felt towards AIA. I wanted to know how her last days were. How many more she had left. I wanted to know that she died.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I'll admit that I didn't know anything about this movie before renting it on Amazon. I was told it was funny, so my husband and I decided to watch.<br /><br />I personally found it utterly vulgar, and couldn't wait for it to end. I just don't find this sort of thing funny at all.<br /><br />Parents, PLEASE take heed of that rated R rating. This movie isn't for anyone under 18-years-old.
B0078PC030|5.0|Our two granddaughters ages 8 and 10 came for a recent visit. As a member of Amazon Prime I often search for movies to entertain them and us. After watching the trailer they chose this movie to watch. We all enjoyed watching it together. It was wonderful to hear them laughing through out the movie. My daughter thought it was something that she had watched this as a young girl and was now enjoying it again with her children. This is a nice,wholesome, entertaining movie for the whole family to watch and enjoy together.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Miss Grandin has done so much to advance the understanding of autism and humane treatment of animals in her life.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander miraculously survived a deadly attack on his brain by e coli meningitis. His experience and recovery are beautifully told. The only problem I have is that he did not mention seeing or meeting Jesus Christ in heaven. As a Christian, I cannot imagine that he could have visited heaven for several days and not had some sort of experience with Jesus.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I couldn't wait for this movie to be released, and I was not disappointed. I watched it twice in the 24 hours I had, and I would love to watch it again.<br /><br />If you haven't watched it, and are looking for a good movie, this is a good one to see.
0452287022|2.0|I found this book to be too short, lacking in character development and excitement of any kind. I am someone who prefers long books that take you through time, that paint a thorough picture of the main characters. I did not get this from Girl with a Pearl Earring. I was very disappointed.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|Truly By far one of the best Terminator flicks....even w Bryce Dallas Howard in the film. Great continuity, outstanding references and for $1.99 how can you beat it!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic! Everything and every actor/character. The scenery is outstanding. The characters are believe able. When was the last time you honestly admired the behavior of the nobility? When was the last time you got angry at the antics of some of a show's characters - Thomas and O'Brien? My only complaint/regret is that this show's run will come to an end. I've nearly finished with season 2. When will season 3 be available on prime?
B009HV2JT8|3.0|My husband and I rented this movie because someone told him it was a good one to see. I wasn't my first pick, but I figured we would give it a try.<br /><br />The movie isn't terrible. It's not something I can't wait to watch a second time, but I don't regret having seen it.
B007VI4TKQ|2.0|The Island of Dr. Moreau suffers from a few major problems.  For one thing, a British man arrives to a tropical island with very little (if any) interesting background information, so even though he's the main character we (the viewers) have no reason to really *care* about him.  He's just a polite and boring man who expresses average emotions whenever he happens to stumble upon several bizarre creatures in the woods.  That's one problem.<br /><br />Also, the storyline itself is really cheesy and seems like it's intended for children even if it doesn't exactly say that it is.  I guess some of this stuff might border on suspense, but it's not really movie worthy and feels suspenseful in an Xena: Warrior Princess or Indiana Jones kind of way (neither of which fills my cup of tea).  It's an adventure movie and should have been stated as such.<br /><br />The creative looking half-human beasts that wander through the forests are probably the only reason one would want to watch a movie like the Island of Dr. Moreau.  Some of them are relatively unique and considering the movie came out in 1996, somewhat ahead of their time in the way they're presented to us on screen.  However, I honestly need important characters that stand out with a compelling storyline, and this movie fails to deliver on both counts.  Avoid.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I have preordered this DVD through Amazon for my film library.  I have seen this film three times at the cinema and wanted one to have on hand for guests who may have missed it.  The film IS NOT historically accurate but is a great story.  The scenes involving the mobs were shot in Turkey and the on scene unit made this film most realistic.  Affleck and Goodman imho &#34;stole&#34; the film; both turned in great performances as well as Bryan Cranston who is a very gifted actor who can do sit coms, cooking meth AND being a CIA agent.<br /><br />If you seek historical truth this movie will disappoint if anyone has taken the time to even know the history of the hostage situation.  However, in terms of pure entertainment value there is no way you can miss by acquiring this film.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|My kids did not like it too much. It did not engage them. They did nit choose it at all.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|this is also a great game from g5. great graphics. price was not too high to unlock the game.  I wish g5 would come out with great games like this more often.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|few brain teasers are worth your time any more but this is kne of the ones that is worth all the timr in the world!!!
B00APJLX8E|4.0|My 3 year old daughter loved the movie. I don't think that I would buy the movie but it was a good rent.
B00881PPTO|5.0|Very easy to use and pulls up many great airlines. It pulls all the deals you find on other well known discount places.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I did very much enjoy reading this book. Didn't stop until I was finish with entire book. I recommend it .
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so addicting I cant stop playing sometime.my brother says \\"you know your still playing that \\" and I say yes
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I loved the story line of this movie better than the first move with Arnold. Loved that they kept true to the first move though...
B00005JLCI|5.0|The full play, no edited down scenes, done as only Branagh can do Shakespeare. Just put it on, sit back, and be prepared for a four hour journey that is great. The Russian setting is very cool twist as setting. This could just as easily been a Dostoyevsky story, so not so far fetched.
B009H442DG|5.0|My wife loves it.  Both have matured throught the years and really come through with class and style.  Look forward to seeing more from these two.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|I enjoyed this explanation how-to book. Good, practical information for anyone seeking fame and fortune in the world of self-publishing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put this book down - great book for the plane, beach or pool. Can't wait for the movie...or the next book by Nicholas Sparks.
B000002J6F|4.0|...but with a new band. This is NOT CSN style stuff. More like what Buffalo Springfield might have become had they stayed together. Altogether some great songs along the way. A couple not my cup of tea, but overall a consistent release by one of the guys who started the whole peace, love and rock and roll movement.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I was determined to finish it but I didn't really enjoy it.  Parts of it felt like science fiction and I was losing interest in the book.  I did finish it but the end was a flop.  I would not recommend this to a friend.
B00AVY5RSK|4.0|I gave this review 4 stars because at the end I get so disappointed, for I want so much more. However considering the era it's to be expected.
0810988232|4.0|Have just started working with this deck and I really like it.  The artwork is beautiful and the backing is insane!  My favorite backing ever!  I love the book that comes with it also ... very thorough.  Have already ordered the other Faerie Oracle ... should be here any day!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Yeah, this is real. And she's got a great gritty voice for the style! Mercy, indeed. Love it. Along with Adele and Amy Winehouse, England is pumping out some good stuff.
B00846F1YW|5.0|You don't have to post to Facebook or Twitter at the end of a level.  There is a small X in the top righthand corner of the dialog box--click it and you can move on.<br /><br />As far as the game goes, it's enjoyable--I like hidden item games.  (If you don't, you might want to pass on this app.)  The graphics are crisp and clear and you can pinch to zoom in and out.  I played the original Mysteryville and was glad to see Mysteryville 2 offered as the FAOTD.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great story with lots of twists and turns.  I have recommended it to family and friends. Great characters and plot twists.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The book gave me some excellent introductory information that I need to self publish on kindle. The examples on how to do the table of contents are good for people like me who know little or nothing about publishing. Thank you.<br />I give the book 4 stars.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie is like a remake of alien.  Acting in this is boring, the special effects are good, plot needs more imagination.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This is a movie I picked up in the hopes that I'd see scantily clad women.  There was a little bit of that, but not much.<br /><br />What I actually got was a somewhat smart movie with an orange obsession (seriously, look for the oranges) about a girl pretending to be slutty and how life spirals down around her.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice.  Three times if you count the time I had it on to provide background noise while I played video games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watch this when my boyfriend is watching sports. It's a good way to pass the time. I get lost in the story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There's a lot going on here.  It's a long book, which I like, because I don't want it to end.  It has mystery, love interest, history points, and I live in Dallas, so I like the placement of the story.  I can almost imagine the neighborhoods.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game has a lot. of detail and is the best game I have ever played. best game ever made on ipod
B0081336FO|5.0|The actors are brilliant!  The Story lines are twisted and complicated as they should be for Sherlock.  And the character relationships are so well done.  You really do fall in love with all of the characters.  The way they show how Sherlock's mind works is so well done.<br /><br />These are definitely not for the casual watcher.  If you blink you miss something important.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there aren't more episodes.  I can't wait for the next season to come out.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Holds your attention.  Makes you want to continue reading.  Enjoyed this book so much I ordered the next two books and I am in the process of reading these books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was such a refreshing change of pace in my reading library.  The story was an awesome story between right and wrong, and if the truth is better then the lies.  The struggle of the human spirit to survive was amazing.  I can't wait to read what Hugh Howdy comes out with next!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you love mahjong, you will love this.  The games are a challenge, and the sound effects are entertaining.  I give it 5 stars.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The main characters in this book were so unlikeable that I didn't enjoy the book.  The plot twist in the middle was great, but I got very frustrated with the characters' actions.  I suppose that the author's ability to make me so frustrated speaks to their skill, but I ended up not enjoying it very much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my daughter loves this game. plays it all day long. I can't figure out how to stay alive more than 2 mins. lol
B0040I09RM|5.0|A very well-written show that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat at all times. What more can you really ask for?
B004NOH9LC|3.0|If you're looking for a nice, simple comedy, this will will serve your purposes. If you don't like awkward moments, this is not the movie for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is good because I've been looking for a game like this forever so I really like this game lots because I love horses lots and lots!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I stil have these attachments and they are going strong.  If you have have a ps3 and play games that require using the L2 and R2 buttons, this is a must.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great story of two men at war; their feelings, lives and hard decisions.  Proof that there is always room for humanity, even amoung enimies.
B001HNE3NO|2.0|The author acted like the reader wasn't going to figure out the ending. It dragged on and on, and the first person's description of her feelings felt like a juvenile diary. It was just too forced.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Great graphics. This is my first time playing a Mysteryville game and am really enjoying it. Will be picking up the series.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Loved it!! I started watching this and couldn't stop. I went from one episode to the next and couldn't stop!
B000054OTY|3.0|Everything with the order was fine.  I can't really rate it because I don't watch it.  My husband does.  ok?
031620157X|5.0|I had read something in the paper about this book and decided to order it since I deeply admire Chris Colfer, as a singer with an amazing voice, an actor who can make you laugh and cry and richly deserved his Golden Globe,  and for  his courage in standing up for his principals at a very young age.<br />The stories are wonderful, a new twist on the fairy tales we all grew up with but updated to be of more interest to his target audience.  I especially loved how he integrated a traumatic and painful loss for the twins into some positive aspects.  I will order his next book as soon as he writes it!!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I preferred the story line of season 1, but this season was certainly chock full of the creepiness and surprises that I've come to expect from the show. Wonder what season 3 will be about?
141970642X|5.0|My 11 year old has read the entire series 5 times! He cant get enough of them. Get them all!.
0792844793|3.0|Roger Ebert gave this film One Star. Leonard Maltin gave it Two. I give it Three Stars out of Five, because it was beautifully shot and quite original. However, Dennis Hopper's over the top and melodramatic performance was a turn off. Why was he screaming all of the time? Where did he take Jeff to? What was Ben's place? I know it wasn't a whorehouse with all of those old, fat women. But it was Hopper's manic-depressive performance that really annoyed me.<br /><br />As I saw this on a video tape made from cable, I must say the video quality was a bit lacking. I will need to buy the DVD and see it again to revisit this movie. Ebert's One Star review is too low. At the same time, Blue Velvet, in my opinion is no way near a Five-Star film. The cinematography, direction and Lynch's use of chiaroscuro so make this film worthy of seeing once, twice and thrice. I give this film Three Stars and reserve the right to increase the Stars once I have seen it on DVD.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B003O86FMW|5.0|totally amazing book. I have read it at least 9 times. its just so intriguing  and I could not put it down
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I am writing this on my Kindle so I will keep this brief.  A Quest For Heroes reads like it was conceived by a second year high school girl.  There is no evidence the author has any knowledge or experience with the fantasy genre or medieval history.  The prose is stilted and poorly composed.  And the characters are flat and stock stereotypes.<br /><br />If this is your first foray into fantasy please explore other authors who know what they are doing.  I do not know who these other reviewers think they are reviewing but it certainly wasnt this author.  Look to J.K. Rowling... look to Frank Baum for Gods sake.  If you want an intro epic fantasy even look to Terry Brooks.  If you want something more mature look to Tolkien or for something more modern seek out th author of The Name of the Wind... just give this thing a pass.  It is not worth anyones time.
1419702238|5.0|My 11 year old has read the entire series 5 times! He cant get enough of them. Get them all!
B000PMFS2I|5.0|First of all I want to state that this review is of the video I taped from cable many years ago. However, I did see this movie when it was originally in theatres in 1995.<br /><br />Most of the people that trashed this movie were older and more conservative movie pundits. Those moviegoers who the movie targeted more or less liked it. I'm looking at the Amazon reviews. As of this writing there are 239 Five & Four Star reviews while there are only 51 One & Two Star reviews (I Omit The Three Star Middle Reviews). Thus that gives the movie and DVD an 82.4% favorable percentage.<br /><br />Another main reason why the movie was not liked was it goes all the way. It has strippers, nudity galore, strong sexual content, bisexual lesbianism, interracial romance and full frontal nudity and gang rape. These are things that most Americans shy away from. Even those who are liberal in their beliefs tend to get antsy by most if not all of these topics (Rape Upsets Everyone, However). When shown so openly on film it can throw people for a loop. This, no doubt, is what happened to those reviewers. Siskel & Ebert trashed the film while Leonard Maltin said it was a Bomb. With a $45 million budget and slightly less than a $38 million take one could argue that. Yet I feel the movie hit the spot when it came to characters and characterization.<br /><br />Nomi Malone is a woman running from her past, yet she is also a woman who is searcing for herself, not knowing what she will be in her life. When she is duped by a man who steals all of her posessions, she meets and is befriended by a young and attractive woman who happens to be a seamstress at Stardust Casino. The two become very close friends, and eventually Nomi is hired at Stardust as a showgirl to the delight of her friend, Molly Abrams.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Nomi she cannot escape drama where she works any more than she can with her life. Cristal seeks to humiliate her at every turn, even trying to dupe her into positions where she is forced to make a choice between money or sex. Cristal seems intent on making Nomi a prostitute. In response, Nomi seduces Cristals beau, Zack, the entertainment director of Stardust. This only exacerbates things between the two, culminating in Nomi's promotion to Cristal's understudy being rescinded. In revenge, Nomi pushes Cristal down the stairs, fracturing her hip. This is seen by Nomi's friend, Molly, which puts a chill between the two. However, Nomi is given the lead and becomes a central attraction.<br /><br />At Zack's home Molly is brutally beaten and raped by Andrew Carver (A Singer) and his cruel cronies. Seeing her good friend comatose in the hospital enrages Nomi. When Zack prevents Nomi from calling the police by blackmailing her with information about her past, she realizes she must take matters into her own hands.<br /><br />Unable to gain justice for her friend with the law, Nomi takes matters into her own hands. She meets up with Carver in his own suite and once alone with him metes out her own justice as she repeatedly kicks him time after time until he is bloody and unconcious. After this she goes to the hospital and tells her friend Molly what she did and before leaving Las Vegas for good, she visits Cristal and apologizes to her for her actions. Cristal takes it in stride, saying she once did the same thing to get her position. The two say goodbye with a passionate kiss and then we cut away to Nomi hitchiking for Los Angeles. In the irony of ironies, Nomi is picked up again by Jeff. Once she removes her sunglasses, to his horror he realizes who he's picked up. Nomi demands her suitcase back and the last shot we see is the sign saying 280 miles to LA.<br /><br />This movie had it all and ended in tragedy for Molly. I felt for Nomi and cared for her greatly. She was a young womean with little or no education struglging to make it in a dog eat dog world. Nomi did her best to eke out an existence, but in the end could not escape her past.I wonder where her character would be today? Could she have survived to her thirties? Would she have been able to get married or was she doomed to repeat her past? It may sound ludicrous, but I'd love to have seen a sequel dealing specifically with Nomi and her trials and tribulations in Los Angeles or wherever else she ended up going.<br /><br />This is a movie only those who can handle strong sexual content should purchase. I'm giving it a positive review and I'm proud to be the 165th person to give the movie a Five Star review and the 327th person overall to review the movie.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B0064HJX56|3.0|As stated above, although we get a glimpse in to what Ky is thinking... it's a bit generic again. I've easily put this down a few times and had to come back to it - but I do want to know what happens. They haven't really explained the society or the rising enough. I know nothing about either really?
0425263908|5.0|It's sooooo much better written than the 50 shades series.  It's a great read that doesn't promote the demeaning of females.  I love it and I've since read the 2 other books in the series.
0810989956|5.0|My 11 year old has read the entire series 5 times! He cant get enough of them. Get them all!
B000060MMI|5.0|This is an unforgettable album. I first heard it while doing donuts in a parking lot on a snowy day. My brother introduced them to me, and I've been hooked ever since! All of FM albums are great, but this one is one of the best if not the best! You'll be singing these tunes forever once you've heard them! I highly recommend this CD to every Flogging Molly fan. You will not be disappointing!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had to buy the UK version because I can't stand the wait.  I won't reveal the show though for the rest of you.  What is it that is so fascinating about this program?  They do a wonderful job of filming this.  We see plenty of space so we get the feeling of the size of the inside of the house.  We see how the servants live among the aristocrats.  The various standards of each class.  It is learning history, painlessly, the way all history should be taught.  Give  me the skeleton to hang history on.  I learned about life during WWI.  The cultural changes that war brings.  Can you imagine dressing for dinner every night?  My husband hates a tie and jacket even once a year.  I also like that they have a one hour special regarding the making of the show and the house it was filmed in.  The home was Lord Carnarvon's.  He was one of the discoverers of King Tut's tomb.  His descendants live among the relics of many generations in that house.  When it is shown on DA, we see it made beautiful similar to earlier times.  The house is on my bucket list.  Can't wait!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Was it teen suicide, attempted murder-suicide, or flat-out murder? Jodi Picoult builds an engrossing story from an emotionally-charged situation. Chris and Emily are two high school seniors who literally grew up together; it's no surprise to their families when they become high school sweethearts. However, it's a total shock when Emily is fatally shot while Chris survives -- and there's something he's not telling. It's fascinating every step of the way as Picoult peels away the layers.

B002M87V0A|5.0|It is one of the best movie musicals ever.  It stands the test of time as a first-class entertainment, and the songs are still great.  If you have any inclination toward musicals, this is one of the special ones.  Robert Preston is phenomenal.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I love a good action movie, and this definitely was the one for me. It is put on my rewatch list.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Well, that is kind of what I felt when I watched this movie without any context. I know know that there is a series of books that this movie is related to and had I known that I might have read some of them beforehand! But, with that said and with no other reference this movie just feels like a cheap action flick with some mixed up drama. The plot just seems so shallow and a lot of the deeper concepts are unexplained.

B005LAIHQS|4.0|Initially, I was a bit skeptical as to the quality of this movie. When I began watching it, the signature, goofy presentation seemed as though it had not aged well since the long past days of the original MIB, and the time traveling plot looked as though it was a disaster of corniness waiting to happen. Fortunately, I suspended judgment, and continued watching MIB3, and I was pleasantly surprised that it became an engaging, heartfelt, fun romp through some of the weirder and wilder corners of science fiction.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the use of the moon launch as the central plot point in this movie, and I felt that this significant moment in human history was implemented brilliantly. The exploration of J and K's relationship was surprisingly moving and well done, with a performance by Josh Brolin that steals Smith's not-inconsiderable thunder at times. The two of them work together quite well, but this should come as no surprise, given their talents and professionalism. The creation of \\"Boris the Animal\\" was a great accomplishment for the creature team of this movie, and he stands out as a truly interesting (and a bit scary!) villain.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased to see the criminally underused Will Arnett and Bill Hayder receive some face time in MIB3... I won't spoil the nature of Hayer's role, but it was hilarious!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|This movie has very vibrate colors and fun music that goes along with it. It's by far one of my sons favorite movies. In one day he's watched it more than 4 times.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|This is sweet to have to keep up with memory usage on the Kindle. Give you the ability to dump lagging APPS that won't let go of that last little bit of memory which in turn speeds the tablet up.<br />It is worth it but you must a some small knowledge of why you want to use it.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Not the greatest but it will do.  I can download and upload - the interface is boring but functionality is there
B003NX76BM|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, it was different. I always enjoy learning about something new- dog training for rescues. Would recommend it!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I have played through have of the puzzles on this game and for the most part they are fun.  The only glitch that I can find so far is that when I try to drag a piece onto the board, most of the time I have to try to 'grab' it two or three times before it will actually drag to the board.  I also have a harder time scrolling through the pieces on the right hand side (sometimes it will not recognize that I am trying to scroll).  Other than that, the game is awesome and I recommend it for any puzzle lovers.  I find I can play on the game for about 2 hours before my battery is drained, so keep a charger handy.
B000SW4DV2|4.0|The kids and I enjoyed this movie! They are four years old and seemed to really like it! I would buy this movie for our home library.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I got this board games a few weeks ago and my friends and family have grown to love it. It's challenging, yet fun. Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The silo series has been my best read in a long time.  Hugh, please continue this story. Also... this needs to be a movie. I think it would top the charts ! My teenagers would love it but won't read it because they're pretty sure if I loved it, they won't. Ha ha. I think it would be right up there with Hunger Games or Twilight.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This is a very good description of Navy Seal training, and of intense combat.  It does get heavy-handed with political rhetoric and attacks on the \\"Liberal Media.\\"  At times the sequence of presentation seems poorly structured.<br /><br />If I could tell the author one thing, I would have to point out that his friends were killed by the Taliban, not the media, and the Seal strategy of inserting a tiny team too far from support and without adequate communication or a firm exit plan.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|one word... AWESOME .... percy meets annabeth (FINALLY...) and they have to complete a quest in which annabeth has the most prominent role among the seven demigods in the prophecy of seven....... a must read for all...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutley love this app... it is fun, makes you think, and is just not hard so download it right away
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|An amazing story - it will make you laugh and rip your heart out. Sky and Holder's characters are so well developed, you'll route for them all the way to the end.
B000T46O52|5.0|Performances well done, as usual, by a couple of my favorite actors.  Makes you think.  Allows you to look at another aspect of life.  The movie is dated, but the theme isn't.
0061906220|5.0|The local library started reading these during a reading session and my kid loved them. We've bought almost all of these books and my kid loves them.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|read this book after all the hype over it but don't know what the fuss was about - disappointing read
B001F6TXME|5.0|The good:<br />- It works exactly as expected.<br />- Buttons and lock are easy to manipulate, even with frozen gloved hands.<br />- The cost was appropriate for a release cord like this.<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Nothing!<br /><br />Overall:  I like it and recommend this release cord.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The crash scene was a little far-fetched, but nonetheless the storyline exceeded my expectations. Denzel did an amazing job playing this role.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I love all of the Toy Story movies, they are great.  The new character, Big Baby is awesome.  It won't disappoint.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|What can I say? The writers are genius. The suspense still remains. It's crazy that one can enjoy the story behind this fantasy serial killer. Dexter is played by a good actor with a superb supporting cast. This season did not disappoint.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I like  this book because it is at my reading level and it is interesting (in fact I fond very books that Jeff Kinney wrote  interesting.) He is one of my favorite book writer.<br />  I like the character \\"Greg\\" in this book because he has experiences  and problems that I have or had. He has problems doing some things and is a master at some things.<br />  I would recommend this book to my brother. He also likes the other of this book and I'm sure he would probably like it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is entertaining and does a good job of making impossible things fit right in with the story. Sure, some of the events are unbelievable at times, but it is a sci-fi show... I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the show. The humor from the absent-minded Dr. Walter Bishop adds nicely to the show as well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fanatical Christian naysayers aside that don't have anything good to say about anything that isn't, &#34;In the bible,&#34; I found this book to be quite interesting. It provokes some of the most essential questions each of us should be asking ourselves...who are we, what is this world....what am I doing here...and what is the nature of God, is he/she a hate filled, vindictive creature that delights in sending &#34;sinners&#34; to an eternal hell?? This book sheds some light on these questions. I am grateful to the author.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Fav comedy besides &#34;Seinfeld&#34;. (Sorry my age is showing.) Just hilarious. Good actors. Good script writers. Legendary if I may quote one of the stars.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a fun game even for the grsandkids.  If you have the oppertunity, make sure you get it.  Thanks
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game was very fun i play it almost everyday i would love if they invented a Temple Run 3.
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|With the Foals you can count on getting a masterfully mixed, engaging, transcendental album dripping with musicality.  They have proven this with their third release, which builds upon their first two albums \\"Antidotes\\" and \\"Total Life Forever.\\"  If you're into the Foals sound, then \\"Holy Fire\\" will be your king for the next good while...or maybe forever.<br /><br />I've always been hit and miss on the \\"indie\\" thing.  It seems to be a genre characterized with compressed and reverby vocals, synths that emanate, and everything from total experimental music to very beat driven guitar laden rock and roll.  In the Foals case at their very best they are one of the most rhythmic and driving, and bring back what I love about 80's music the most.  It's like I'm listening to what I wish Men at Work or The Cure was.<br /><br />The Foals first couple albums were great, there's a few gems on them that will always be on my playlist like \\"Big Big Love\\" and \\"Spanish Sahara,\\" which is so layered and just an incredible song.  \\"Holy Fire\\" brings everything they've been doing well, and adds a little more funk, spice and Yannis' singing is the best I've heard.  It's like they took everything that worked in their style and emphasized it.  This is truly an incredible album and one that you won't regret purchasing...ofcourse unless you're not into this type of music...which would make it weird that you're reading this sentence right now.<br /><br />After listening through the album one thing that is very noticeable is the use of syncopated guitar, drum, synth sections.  The Foals have really tightened this aspect of their music, and it gives the songs a cohesion and musicality that just isn't present in most music today.  It's most present on tracks like \\"Stepson,\\" \\"My Number\\" and \\"Bad Habit,\\" and it's more of a constant on this album then their previous work.<br /><br />I've always loved the Foals more melodic slower paced songs.  Each one on this album is haunting and beautiful.  The slower stuff really showcases the mixing, layering and dynamic's that they must spend a ton of time perfecting.  \\"Late Night,\\" is a beautiful track which showcases this.  It builds tempo throughout and is one of the best songs on the album. \\"Moon\\" also uses a great harmonic rhythm to accompany Yannis' voice.<br /><br />Overall this is the kind of album that you can get lost in...and you won't want to come back from it.  Beautiful stuff.wer stuff really showcases the mixing, layering and dynamic's that they must spend a ton of time perfecting.  \\"Late Night,\\" is a beautiful track which showcases this.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Someone told me that I would enjoy this series and they were right. A very suspenseful and intelligently written plot.
0345803493|5.0|The second book in this series was absolutely AMAZING! I don't get into book trends too much but this is one I fell in love with. It was the most exciting book I've ever read.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book was not easy to get into but once I was into the story it kept my interest.  I had to remember that it was fiction as it was very believable.

0345803507|5.0|This book, which they call &#34;mommy porn,&#34; was absolutely amazing. I breezed through it and can't wait for the movie!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show has a great combination of drama and humor. The science seems plausible to the average person, we generally don't know enough about what they are saying to question what's happening.
B00B99QTM4|5.0|It's a tradition! My wife and I have watched it every year for 20 years on Groundhog Day. It came out the year we were married.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|My niece loved the movie when I got it for her for Christmas. She loves to dance with them in the movie
0345803485|5.0|I recommend this book for anybody who has become entangled in tv love. This book will knock your socks off and keep you on your toes!
B00APJLY0Q|3.0|I regret buying.  There are some funny scenes, but it was not the type of movie that you are eager to watch a second time.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|It provided me with knowledge I never knew before, and this is just one of countless operations our military has executed for our freedom. Just proves freedom ain't free.
B002VWNID6|5.0|I use to love this movie when I was younger. Definitely one of my favorite Robin Hood Movies of all time
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game for rides in the car, sitting in the waiting room, and for those nights when the Buffalo Wild Wings blazing hot sauce isn't agreeing with your stomach
B001NESPHC|5.0|Heard Ms Gardot on my Panadora one day and so glad I made a spur of the moment purchase.  This album is a must have for a Sunday afternoon.
B0065UF2ZM|5.0|Any book Michael Connelly writes is good.  An author guaranteed to entertain and virtually always writes a great book.  Highly recommended author in general.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I Bought this movie for my husband and he watches it all the time. Loves all the action in it
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My grandson loved it. played for hours and hours. great game and great fun for all who played this game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Having read a previous print edition years ago, and having read several reviews of this e-edition, I wasn't sure what to expect.  What I found was a wonderful, very complete, exceedingly readable version of this classic, timeless, novel.  Virtually no errors such as I have found in other e-editions, and nothing but pure pleasure in an amazing translation of Hugo's challenging but worthwhile trip through history and language.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved all the seasons of Downton Abbey. This season was great, even though I didn't like the ending- it was inevitable due to some cast not renewing for a newly announced 4th season. Otherwise, the time and adaptation is amazing. Can't wait for season 4!!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this band and love this cd. We listen to it all the time in the car and jam to it
B007SGM084|5.0|Completely took me by surprise! I very much enjoyed it. Also,hoping to see more from this series! Loved Christians point of view at the end as well. Very interesting. All in all two thumbs up! Well worth every penny as well as all my sacrificed sleep while staying up to read it because I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN:)
B005LAII3A|3.0|This was okay for a re-make.  But that being said, why aren't there more original movies?  Has the orginality gone out of Hollywood?  I have been more than a little disappointed with the things coming out of hollywood these days.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I can't really recommend this book.  I would recommend that you download the preview ahead, and take a read first... I wish I had done that.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Ken Follett has really studied this era and knows his history.  It was a history lesson as well as intertaining.  I can't believe such brave women!  They were awsome.
1844488748|5.0|It's really awesome and I simply love it. Very useful book. Cool n easy to learn. Amazing...... I enjoy it
B002ZG98UA|3.0|This was a typical Resident Evil movie with predictable creatures and a typical cliff-hanging end.I think the could have done better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great love story! Read it in less than a day. I loved the characters very much. I can't wait for the next one!
B005EJNAK4|5.0|My husband isnt too much into scifi movies but he did enjoy this one he was a bit confused as he missed the first ten min. of the movie but was hooked pretty quickly.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Great entertainment, enjoyed its easy humor, fun story line.  Johnny Depp is always fun to watch even as a cartoon
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|This was a little bit of the same old, same old.  I was a little disappointed as I was expecting better humor and character development.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|The footage may seem a bit dated, but the show is as current and relevant as ever. Superb, fine-tuned performances coupled with British political intrigue at its best. Highly addictive!
1895565375|5.0|I had to attend a baby shower for my best friend of almost 10 years! :) It is very exciting that she has come to this point in her life.  As I was thinking of unique gifts that I could get her other than registered stuff I remembered my mother reading me this book when I was young.  To this day we still talk about the book.  I purchased it for her and her little man.  As she pulled it out of the bag her mother gasp and said &#34;I read that to my son.&#34;
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Nicely secured, no rattleing in the case! Came in earlier than I thought it would. Will have to get the book I saw you offering. I like that it was brand new, this is always a plus when you can find something that was not used by someone else. The price was also great!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Having read the book, I must say that they have kept to the original guidelines.  I don't see why it had to be broken up into two movies unless it is just a way to make more money.  Just once, it would be nice to see Hollywood do something for the movie audience without thinking of how to line their pockets.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|AVANT-INTELLECTUAL-PLAYFUL-DEAD SERIOUS and wistfully charming.<br /><br />it's not worth it to try and describe this album. i just hope that some younger person will listen to this and it will move, change them forever as a some few handfuls of works did for myself in the 20th century. my hopes arise with this wonderful new and ancient banner! VIVA LA SPIRIT!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Overall I thought this book was pretty good. I liked the storyline. I would recommend it for a quick read.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Riding on a butterfly!  Gee, God must love to fly...<br />This book is so lame you get dumbed down just by reading it..doh!
B00936A0RU|5.0|This was a great movie by itself but when I realized that it was based on a true story I was more than intrigued.  Why is it that it taked film makers and actors from other countries to bring American folklore movies to life?  It is a shame that we don't have more movies like this one.  The script was great.  The acting was great.  And over-all I think this was one of the better films to come out in 2012.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the most joyful game and when I want to compete with my Friends.I think of it as like temple run but better.it makes me laugh about the fat cop and his dog but I don't get how the trains come out of no where.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This movie kicked some serious ass. It showed what happens when you push someone to the edge. It also showed how a gov't agency takes credit for someone else's hard work
B000FC146C|4.0|i've read this book at least 3 times and always enjoyed it. read it first time in my teens. mccullogh is a good storyteller and i especially like her geographical descriptions and descriptions of life in australia. the characters she creates are all interesting and believable. i'm not typically a &#34;romance&#34; reader and i wouldn't categorize this book as purely romance. if you're looking for a good story with lots of details and a healthy dose of romance then this is the book for you!
B005J4TLN4|3.0|I was expecting something like Shaun of the Dead but sadly I was disappointed.  It was like the comedy was &#34;forced&#34; and the characters were very one dimentional.  The only plus was the aliens.  They were very cool.  All black but a glow-in-the-dark set of blue teeth.
B0084670FU|3.0|hard to keep up with,not a movie i would recomand. movie=babel should be an r rated movie . parts of the movie are boring.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|This was another good movie. The plot was interesting and you had no idea what was coming next. I recommend it to anyone who is a Washington fan- or not.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|have it on my iphone and am so excited to finally get it on my kindle :-) cant wait to play it on here :-)
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Dark comedy at it's best.  I could see this becoming a cult classic.  I hope they do a sequel. I would deffinately buy it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I can monitor my eBay business, list products for sale and see my activity.  I really like this app for EBay
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Do not get this app unless you pay for the upgrade. But why pay for an alarm clock when there are free ones ads pop up and the alarm did not go off when I set it
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|the drawing and compitition is fun but the ads sure make it irritating but then again i know if u want to pay u wont have that problem---. no pay--- my 14 yer old grandaughter got hooked when she was here now im having more trouble with the site. am ready to quit. i have to reboot it all the time to finish a game. no im not going to pay if thats the reason its happening.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Great original movie.  Bruce Willis is 2012 - 2013 actor of the decade.  He is not showing any signs of slowing down either.  Joseph Gorden-Levitt is also one of the busiest actors in Holly Wood also.  I especially loved the way they let you make up your own mind about what really happened.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|These people's music soak all the way into my bones, which causes me to shake! Can't wait to hear them more.
0446554995|3.0|I, too, was distracted by the unnecessary side stories. Could have been 50 pages shorter and it would have been same story. Plot with corrie wasn't even interesting. A car dealership scam?? Maybe only if Bigfoot was in the back doing the detailing. Could have a lot better and tighter.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|It was an OK film. Typical Tom Cruise Mission Impossible fare. Lots of action and some comedy in this installment of Mission Impossible Protocol
B009MO57H6|5.0|Now this is more like it.  I'm glad that they brought back some of the original actors.  This one was worth the money and my time to watch it.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I wanted to try something different from my usual choices in music.  This was a good choice.  The music is good and I enjoy listening to it regularly.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|Kevin Spacey is great, as are Simon Baker, Stanley Tucci, and Jeremy Irons. I want to believe that this did not happen, but very realistic. Yikes!
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Really, what more needs to be said.  This is the best sci-fi show since Babylon 5 and Farscape.  Hopefully they will bring it back.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This series of movies are well acted but I can't help but think that they are the violent depressing characterization of the Batman tale.  I much prefered the earlier Batman movies where they were played a little &#34;tongue-in-cheek&#34; with a great mixture of humor as well as human frailties.
B007MU85D0|4.0|All of the songs are good on this album.  The voices blend together very well.  Even though I like the album, many of the songs sound very similar.  Great background music.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Once I started, I got caught up in the characters and story line and the mystery of the show, it has great twists and turns in the plot and keeps you guessing the whole way thru.  Really enjoyed season 1.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We spent quite a bit of time watching season one through three in the past two weeks! Humor, life, bumps, and anything can happen.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was good nightclub B-) jknjkkjjjjmkkkkkhhjbvhvgggggvghi. In j I j in j j :/ h :/ in on m B-) j/
B007M45PMU|4.0|I love two songs on the album, Hey Ho and Stubborn Love.  The rest of the album was just so-so in my opinion.  They are good for listening to something different.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the book. Cant get enough. I look forward to the movie and I hope that they stick to the story line.
B005PK56TA|5.0|if you allow yourself to get a little lost in the horror/fantasy world they created.  Great late night viewing and excellent twists and turns.  Pay attention and it will be rewarding.
B009PAETCG|5.0|I recommend this to any sporty fun and outgoing person!!! It Is So Energetic!! I love this because I'm a sporty chica ;)
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I've read these two books twice now. The first time last year, and I had planned to wait until the third book came out to read them again. I simply could not wait. They were far too good. Even this second time, I lost sleep and work to this book. I couldn't stand to put it down.<br /><br />Patrick is a wordsmith and a worldbuilder of amazing skill, and he manages to tell a grand story in an engaging world full of rich and vibrant characters. If you are a fan of fantasy at all, I strongly encourage you to read this series.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I got this for my son but now we fight over it. NOTE you have to have a Facebook acct but you can only play on your device. That seems odd to me, but doesn't really matter, to some it may though.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was very adventurous and it kind of transported me inside the story. It was a very good book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the best because it's awesome ,and th<br /><br /> Book is about love that part is the best yea
B003U53QT4|4.0|Season 5 is a mix between showing what the survivors on the island experienced and how the survivors who returned to America plot their return to the island. More than the others, this season jumps around quite a bit. Some episodes focus on the six in America, then later we get to see what other characters were up to during that time. In fact, I felt like much of season 5 consisted of filling in gaps. Things are even more confusing because there's a lot of time travel in this season. It generally works, but often it means that we don't actually get to see the characters develop over time, just the end results.<br /><br />I really enjoyed seeing how the characters stuck behind on the island grow and adapt to their circumstances. Sawyer and Juliet reach new stages in their character development. Sawyer joins the Dharma Initiative and takes on some responsibility. It's nice to see consequential changes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Jack and Kate are up their usual selves, rushing off to action without thinking. I'm glad Sawyer called Jack out on it. I wish their characters showed greater maturity and depth. Jack's character seems really inconsistent. In season 5, he seems intent on abandoning responsibility, almost as if the story writers thought they needed to shake the character up.<br /><br />The peripheral characters, such as Dan and Miles, each get their own episodes and flashbacks. Unlike some of the earlier attempts to introduce new characters into the show, I think the show has absorbed these two pretty well.<br /><br />Oh, and why do these people still trust Ben? Why hasn't somebody killed that lying jerk by now? One of the highlights of this season for me was Sun knocking Ben out saying that she didn't trust him.<br /><br />For a while, I was getting sick of how the show tries to keep the mystery by never allowing the characters to explain their motivations. It always seemed that there was \\"no time\\" for a proper explanation. Fortunately, by the end of this season, we finally get a bit of an explanation that ties things from the various seasons together. It's not a full revelation, but at least there's an endgame in sight.
0060555661|4.0|While there is some information here that does not apply today.  It does teach how to invest, what to invest in and how not to let emotions get in the way,. Also is a good history lesson concerning our country's  past history of investing.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a game my daughters can play for hours.  It also has great special effects and it is alot of fun!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I've been disappointed in this book.  In my opinion, the plot doesn't reach out and grab you.  The Harry Potter books were so outstanding that I expected Ms. Rowling's next effort to be stronger.  I do realize that genius has its mediocrity at times.  I look forward to her next book.
B00A8ZZ570|3.0|There are some really great compositions on here, mixed in with a few meandering experiments gone wrong. It's not helped by the mix either, with the sax way up front, and everyone else way behind. The bass and bass drum are almost inaudible, and the piano only surfaces in a few sporadic places.<br /><br />I recommend you check out the individual samples before purchasing. Better yet, pick up Pat Metheny's Unity Band release.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I couldn't get this game to work. Tried it twice. Uninstalled and re-installed two times and it still wouldn't load up. It would act like it then just drop out to my phone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its so much easier having a virtual horse than real ones. I have 3 horses in real life so its nice to play and not work up a sweat. ;) Fun getting to see them all.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought it was a really good fast read. There was a lot of emotion in this book and you really feel for sky and hope the best for her. And she meets a great guy with a secret you may not expect.
044655667X|3.0|Nothing to do with the author, just that the print is really small and I DO wear glasses, so ...
B00B0ZT9NI|2.0|This movie lacked soul. Seemed more of a made for TV type of flick. Really hate that wasted money on this one.
030758836X|2.0|Several of my reader friends recommended this book to me.  I read the fly leaf and decided not to buy it.  I'm so glad!  I got the book from the library twice and couldn't get into the story.  The way the book is written is not a style I enjoy (switching characters back and forth), and I didn't care for the characters who I find to be pompous, a bit stereotypical in an unintended way, bitter and unlikeable.  However, because I usually like the books my friends read, I started listening to this book on CD.  I am near the end , and twice I've almost quit listening for several reasons.  The characters' thought processes are more complex than the characters themselves. Neither Nick nor Amy are likeable, so why keep reading?  Because of the HUGE twist.  When I heard that, I thought about what would most likely be a HUGE storyline twist, and I guessed correctly.  I'm not a prude, but there are several words that I find offensive as well as regional generalizations, and the fact that Amy seems to believe she's so much more intelligent than the rest of the world. I've known a few people like her who hold grudges and continue to offend or embarrass their victims long after the imagined offense. Finishing this book is unpleasant, but I'm determined to see it through now.<br /><br />I will say I'm glad so many people enjoy different writing styles and story lines.  It would be a boring world if we all liked the same things.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|This movie is great for an afternoon. Another classic tale of identity and rebellion. Ferris Bueller is Puck from Midsummer night's dream, Cameron and Ferris's sister are the only two characters who have an interesting arc (the climax for Cameron is the destruction of his father's car and for Jeannie, its kissing the stranger, Charlie Sheen, at the police station).
1439102430|5.0|I love the science, the storyline, much better than the TV show, as entertaining as it is.  I can hardly wait for the next one to come out.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|When this show first aired a few years ago I wanted to watch it but never found the time.  Now I can watch it when I want to and have found it very interesting.  If you like sci fi you will enjoy this show and especially the acting of John Noble.  He steals the show.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I spent many a day devouring old Sherlock Holmes mysteries. What a tremendously gifted writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was! These stories are as thrilling today as they were when they were written. No wonder Sherlock Holmes is such an enduring character.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Yeah, I'm cheap. I rarely need microphones, but these work great anyway. I use them to mount to my H4n or directly to my camera. Great audio.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Even though I am not married yet, I found this book very helpful for my fiance and myself. I better understand his needs, as well as my own. May this help us have a long and happy life together!
1938469011|3.0|The book is well written and well researched.  There is some interesting material on historical  hops growing and research.  But as a home brewer looking to improve my beer making I didn't get that much out of the book.  A lot of the material I've read elsewhere. Maybe that's the problem, I've read a lot, so there wasn't that much new material here that is useful to a brewer - though there is some.  Not a bad book, just not what I was looking for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i like potatoes and minecraft pocket addition so buy minecraft and potatoes i would give them both a7 maybe 8 no about 7
B007FKI9G0|5.0|Is there a surviving Spinal Tap drummer? Great movie, classic, first in a long tradition of mostly unscripted, but strangely cohesive, mockumentaries. This movie defined the rock-movie mockumentary and has continued with films like Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind. Great early morning film when you're tired of the news.
B009X011UQ|3.0|I like the convenience the stand offers while reading and using my Kindle.  I like the fit and safety it gives for the Kindle in case of dropping.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Brilliant series!! Totally addicted!!<br />Thomas and Mrs. Obrien are so bad!!<br />Maggie Smith keeps things prim and proper!<br />Mary and her many suitors!!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I love this series. I'm not a tv person in general but this show is my weak spot. I have yet to be let down. Although not each show is belly laughing funny the majority of them are. This is better than I can say about anything I've seen in 2 decades or more.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|There are a LOT of glass cutters out there and most of them pretty much suck. This one was the cheapest I could find. I got it to work after much trial and error. The old technique of applying hot, then cold, then hot, then cold, but gently seems the best way to use it. This is really unclear in the instructions. Oh and DON'T try to cut through labels or printing on the bottle - it ain't gonna work.
0143038583|5.0|This was a good choice, and very helpful in my studies. I would recommend this book to others who are interested by this topic.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Deep Space Nine was an amazingly complex series that dared to take the Star Trek franchise where it had never gone before.  All Star Trek befor this had been based on a ship moving to different planets and dealing with different situations.  DS9 was based on a space station and challenged viewers to embrace that very different vision.  The shows plots dealt with themes of relationships, loss, politics, religion, cultural clashes, and evolving societies that must face changing circumstances.  It was a show that challenged conventional ideas of what Star Trek was about and demanded more from its viewers than any previous show.  It premiered the same year that another great science fiction drama debuted, Babylon 5, and shared many commonalities with it.  Both were based on space stations rather than ships or planets, both were heavily invested in themes of polities, religion, and the clashes between cultures and viewpoints, and both created universes that were unique, engrossing, and invited viewers to be involved in the process.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|This is the best Batman story I have seen to date. I love how they stuck to the books for the most part and that really captured the feel that Miller was going for.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Assuming you have already studied the nature of stories and characters, this book will tell you how to write out the beats in a screenplay and get them right for any genre. Say what you want, but he was right: today's films are formulaic and he lays out that formula. No joke, I've written 3 screenplays so far with his techniques! He won't tell you how to get an agent or get your screenplay sold, but it won't be the script's fault. ;)
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It didn't show how to play the game or I couldn't find the instructions. But, then again, I'm a baby boomer generations.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|It's just a fun adventure movie. I have watched in multiple times and always find something i have missed previously. Harmless fun
B002YCVX5S|4.0|A good/very good, edge of chair movie that, for a while, had us believing it might have been a true story?  I<br />While it wasn't it was, nevertheless, very entertaining.  The only negative was the presence of a significant amount (30%+) of subtitling.  The problem was the pace at which the subtitles appeared and disappeared.  If one is not a fast reader, a lot of dialog, in the form of subtitles, will be missed.
0062200909|5.0|After watched the movie, i wondered the art of hobbit, ordered and shipped less than estimated time. overall, book is cool!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting and makes me play for at least 2 hours at a time.I love the 3D graphics in the game they are very good for mobile standards.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Shocking insight into what we are putting into our bodies, we need to wake up as a society and make a stand as consumers .....must see..
B007FTZDN8|1.0|After downloading TED I was not able to connect to vids.  The download was corrupted and I spent my time trying to get it off my phone.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A very nice ending to the series or at leace a nice way to wrap up the first three books.
0765325950|4.0|To start with, I am very satisfied with this book.  It had so many inherient challenges and I think BS did a great job creating a believiable ending.  RJ simply created such a complex web of plots that the ability to pull it all together into one volume was simply too much to be achieved.  The readers would not allow for the ending to be dragged out and RJ's widow wanted the big pay day.  Put together, you get a case of compression.  People die left and right and there is no space to elaborate on how that impacts the other characters.  The epilogue is simply too short and leaves the door open for a new series of the post last battle.  Ca Ching!!!!<br /><br />Some open questions<br /><br />* When did Egwene become such military tactical master?<br />* What happened to Rand after he \\"dies\\"?  How did the change occur?<br />* Why does Rand not give a crap about his coming family at the end?<br />* So Demandred was not hiding at all....<br /><br />I recommend buying the book and enjoying it for what it is, a compressed solution.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Great story, great acting. I haven't read the book, but was very captivated by the movie. A good use of my time while taking a break from my studies. Enjoy
B00729Z6R4|5.0|Sweden Rocks!  Wish we still had music like this in the USA.  This to me is a huge step up from the last CD.  Listen to it all the time!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What's not to love about following a family with just enough drama to keep you wondering what's next, a glorious estate in which to suffer, and a cast of characters to love and hate. No car chases. No gore. No contemporary edginess. Just lovely clothes and restrained civility. And the lurking threat of inevitable change. Delightful!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|It's a comfort to know that it's &#34;OK&#34; not to enjoy a high volume, frenetic life. Of course I knew that already, but reinforcement is always nice. I appreciate the author's distinction between a culture which values character and a culture which values personality alone. The cult of personality creates a need in some to remake themselves in the current mode instead of developing their own strengths and talents. Very well written book.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is the finest documentary on Rush that I have seen.  It spans their career and speaks quite personally to the audience.  Having been a devoted fan since 1981, it answered many questions, evoked endless smiles and created a connection and an understanding.  The interviews done by other artists are perfect in explaining the level of talent that is so incredibly rare to see in individual musicians that the fact that the three members of Rush came together nearly 40 years ago and have stayed together, and evolved musically is unique to them alone.  If you aren't a Rush fan, then you probably aren't a formally studied musician.  If you are a formally studied musician and don't at least admire and respect them, then something is likely wrong with you.
B0087WRGVY|4.0|Very well recorded, just wish the lyrics had a better message.  Although I love the music and vocals, depressing to listen to.  I like music to be uplifting.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|it kept me reading,,but not to the point where I felt &#34;I have to get Back to it&#34; I can't see parents not knowing someone is in your daughters room or for that matter your sons.. but it is just a book.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|We purchased this based on all of the positive reviews, but found it to be corny, bland and boring.  I wish we could get our money back!<br />There was potential to bring some tension into the plot, but that never materialized.  The acting wasn't very good, in spite of the great cast.<br />I can't recommend buying this dvd.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It was a good thing. to get this for free. it a good thing that I can use it. I would  get again. You should try it today or tomorrow
B0052FG8KO|5.0|Love the rock from Europe! Very well recorded, great music, great vocals.  Wish we still had music like this in the USA.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very addicting book that draws you in and I couldn't stop reading. Would recommend it as a great book to read.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I thought the book was good for light reading, it was very Mills and Boonie, it was very predictable, but did hold the interest. I didn't like the repitition of the sexy bits.  I would recomment this book to anyone who wanted something light to read on the train or waiting in a drs surgery etc.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book after seeing all the hype it got online. It is probably one of the best books I've ever read in my life.
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|The story itself wasn't bad, but the spelling and grammar errors were so numerous they were very annoying.  Get a program to for this!  I'll probably read the others in the series through the lending library, but I wouldn't pay money for them.
159562015X|4.0|I read the book and took the online test and received the results. The results were accurate but I was a little disappointed with the actions part of it. Different but similar to the Myers-Briggs assessment without the inclusion of weaknesses.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Wnenever I get started playing Jewels Star I always have a hard time stopping, I'm addicted. I'm always having to put my cell phone or my Kindle on charge, because I run the battery down playing this game. I love it, it's a little more challening than some of the other match three games I've played.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Let's face it: after QUANTUM OF SOLACE, we were all kind of hesitant about what kind of film BOND 23 would be.  Even when Sam Mendes, director of the classic AMERICAN BEAUTY, signed on, we were still skeptical.  We all know Daniel Craig brings a certain screen presence to the role; he may not be Sean Connery, but then, Connery's Bond wouldn't necessarily work nowadays.  (Don't get me wrong: love the classic Bond.  Hell, I'm even a Roger Moore fan, don't hold that against me.)  Craig's Bond is a morally flawed creation, a character with a dark heart who (usually) does the right thing for (sometimes) the right reasons.<br /><br />Here's the trick about SKYFALL, what makes this film work so well: it isn't even about Bond.  The film centers around M (Judi Dench), and her dangerous past, which is personified in the rise of a new villain: Silva.  He's a cyberterrorist who could bring about the collapse of civilized society with the push of a button...but instead, he's using his power to bring M to her knees.  Bond is merely a pawn in his scheme: two rats fighting for survival.  Which animal will triumph, and which will be torn to shreds?<br /><br />SKYFALL is a brilliant film.  Plain and simple.  It has its flaws, as do all Bond films (even a Moore film wouldn't have stooped to the level of CGI Komodo dragons...well, maybe).  But its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.  Director Mendes has flat-out stated that, without the success of THE DARK KNIGHT, SKYFALL would not have been possible; this is evident, for what KNIGHT did for superhero films, SKYFALL does for the Bond franchise.  (Purists beware: this is a Bond who wears his heart on his sleeve, and you may not like what you see.)  The script is intelligent; that's a rarity for an action film.  The directing is solid.  The scope is broad: shifting Bond into a new era, while at the same time cementing his legacy.  (Fanboys will get a few delights.)<br /><br />But what this film really comes down to is the caliber of acting.  Craig gives his best Bond to date, but even he's out-shined by the supporting cast.  In her expanded role, Dench is a marvel.  It's been refreshing to see her interacting with Craig; here, their chemistry truly comes alive, as two brilliant actors get to take their roles to new levels.  Ralph Fiennes, as a bureaucrat who sees the 00 program as antiquated, is subtle; his performance slowly builds on itself, as his best usually do.  Ben Whishaw and Albert Finney breathe some fresh blood into things; as far as \\"Bond girls,\\" we have Naomie Harris, whose character is perhaps the least fleshed-out, and an especially good Berenice Marlohe.  But as we all know, a great Bond film is nothing without a great villain, and Javier Bardem gives us one of the best (in my mind, THE best) the franchise has to offer.  Silva is a menace; he's maniacal and unpredictable, a sociopath bent on a vicious, kamikaze vendetta.  He's truly unhinged, and for good reason; as crazy and manipulative as he gets (his opening scene is a brilliant choreography of psychological manipulation; some viewers have gotten a little antsy, but pay attention and you'll understand), you can't help but sympathize with him.  And that is the core brilliance of SKYFALL: it's an intensely personal film, so much so that viewers get sucked into the story despite the typical Bond locales and damseles in distress.  SKYFALL is a great Bond movie; some have said it's the greatest, but that's really a matter of taste.  What's hard to deny is that, no matter where it ranks in the Bond cannon, SKYFALL is simply a great movie.  Period.cting.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really like subway surfers.  It's basically temple run however in my opinion better. Whoever is reading this you should get this game.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Playing this game is a great way to pass the time. I really like the fact that you can turn the timer off and play at your own pace. I would recommend this game to those who like hidden object games.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|Get yourself a bowl of popcorn, put the kids to bed, tell whoever is with you to shut up, turn off your cell phone and get ready for a trip.  This is so far beyond what American cinema can handle, it makes me want to do nothing but watch foreign films from this day forward.  Prepare to have your mind blown.
0930073193|5.0|This book demonstrates that our &#34;common sense&#34; should tell us what constitutes good economic policies. The book rationally  debunks most of the arguments made by Statists (both Democrats and Republicans), that the government should tinker with a free market. This book has equiped me to refute the irrational arguments we hear for excessive government intervension in the our economy.<br />The author is both a first class economist and a good writer, so the book is clear and easy to read. My copy is is now heavily underlined and annotated.<br />Enjoy-Learn-Annoy a Statist!
B000EU1PKA|5.0|The album is a complete departure from their first 3 albums but not at all atrocious. It is diverse that is all, has a mix of ballads and metal stomping tracks. Helloween is still at their finest.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|So far this one of the best books I've ever read.  I am looking forward to reading some of her other books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This story was WAY beyond what I expected. I couldn't put it down for anything . I think I lost some sleep over this trilogy. Definitely will read again. Over and over again.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|I dont need to say much about the film itself as its the basic Cohen vehicle.  The accents are over acted and the plot is far fetched.  The jokes roll on and on and they are funny.  The love story is pretty well played as well as you dont know from the start what will happen.<br /><br />The real gem here is the UN speech by the dictator.  You can probably skip over the rest of the movie to be to it and it would still be worth watching.  This movie nails the 1% debate so well.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have been watching the series and decided to read the books. Excellent story, highly recommend. So far the series has stayed true to the books.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Hard to put down. Was rooting for the main character . I will never think about flowers the same way ever again.
0425263908|5.0|After reading some of the reviews I feel there needs to be a caveat. When I read a story, I'm looking for entertainment. If I want a discourse on troubled, abused adults trying to work through a relationship, I'll look for nonfiction self help. This is a STORY. This story is about a rich, hot, sexy man who falls in lust & love with a woman. The woman is hot and sexy; she falls in lust & love with a man. Is every situation reality? No! This is a story.<br /><br />These characters are not real people, they're fiction. They are incredibly well developed and emotionally deep. In the HEA world, I want my man to say things like Gideon, do things he does, call me angel, take me to bed at every opportunity, etc. Gideon is an excellent dirty talker and knows what to do with his equipment. He's dominant and aggressive. Do I want that every day in reality? No. This is a story. Eva is beautiful and wealthy. Do I run every time things get a little confusing, I'm insecure, or I'm jealous? No. This is a story. Do I expect someone to run after me or send 21 messages in 30 minutes to my voice mail? No. This is a story. However, in the HEA world, that translates to a guy who realizes he seriously screwed up and doesn't want her go very far so he can explain. I want my HEA guy to know immediately he hurt my feelings and go overwhelmingly above and beyond fixing it so that other people think it's plain crazy.<br /><br />I am completely engrossed in this story. Every time there's a lull at work, I'm thinking about Eva and Gideon. I can't wait to get home so I can read. Last night there was an internal battle:  Sean The Bachelor or Gideon Cross? If I'm an author, that's my motivation to write and my reward for the blood, sweat and tears I'd poured into a story.<br /><br />Sylvia Day has done an incredible job entertaining me and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next two books!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince must have been under the gun to meet a deadline. Three quarters of the book was great but as soon as I started thinking this book is as good as Memorial Day or Consent to Kill, he seems to be in a hurry to wrap things up; I wanted another 100 pages or so. Don't get me wrong, The Last Man is a very good book, I just think it could have been a great book.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie was better than I expected!! I had thoughts of same old spin but I was wrong.......BOURNE FANS GET READY!!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I was delighted to learn from this book that I am not a freak of nature, but in fact similar to 1/3 to 1/2 of the population who think and feel differently. A great book for both extroverts and introverts to learn through good research how we compliment each other.

0525478817|3.0|I've read all of Green's books. I'm a former English teacher and YA lit lover, so I was expecting great things. I ended up disappointed. The dialogue wasn't authentic; the characters were indistinguishable, and the plot was predictable. The obsession over the Van Hauten book was contrived. The book didn't suck, but it wasn't his best work either. It was just ok.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|This movie is exactly what it needs to be – a fun, action movie with just enough plot and setting to make it enjoyable. I've read a few Clive Cussler books with Dirk Pitt, and though Matthew McConaugheyhey isn't what I pictured, he does a good job. Steve Zahn is a great sidekick and the rest of the cast add flavor.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is like having your own horse!! I could play it for hours! And its free best game on the app store!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a great show.  I love the dialogue and the characters (especially the Dowager Countess.)  The show is visually beautiful -- each scene is like a painting.  Julian Fellowes is a genius.  All his shows draw me in and won't let go.

1932100660|2.0|I read this book, did with diet, and took Dr. Campbell's Cornell online plant based course (an expensive investment). The book did break some myths about diet that I previously had, specifically that we don't need that much protein and carbs in their plant form do not inherently make you fat.  I was already in good shape 190 8%bf and noticed great feelings initially, but they gradually began to fade. Others have found similar findings that the diet acts as almost as a cleanse, that gradually leaves you feeling lacking in something.  It also allowed for more processed foods such as grain cereals/pastas/breads all whole wheat of course But after some common sense and other research, I really was not convinced that this is the ideal diet. After being very proud of my diet and touting its great benefits and I had to crawl back with my tail between my legs and admit I was wrong. I should also some \\"myths' were true in myself.  My hair and muscle tissue was also thinning out.  I had a thick head of hair that my wife and mother commented was thinning. Since switch back, my hair is noticeably much thicker.  My muscle tone while I was losing weight was also diminishing as my bf (usually at 7-8%) increased to 10-12%.  Running on high on glucose and this diet does you'll also be wanting food more and more.<br /><br /> There's just too many populations living healthy with animal products and have been for generations.  I had to look no further than this truth in my own grandparents who lived on a farm and ate lard daily and both lived vibrantly into their 90's. I'm since back on a diet high on fat, lower on protein, and moderate carbs. Definitely feel better physically as compared to a vegan diet. Try it for yourself. Read Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food for a realistic down to earth stance on our current state of nutritional science. We are still in our infancy in understanding how food works in our bodies.  Following a whole foods classical diet of eating with higher fatcontent, moderate protein, and a great deal of plants for many months, my blood pressure is low 111/68 bodyweight is still healthy at 190 8%bf I find no reason to ever go back to that style of eating.<br /><br />People will often tout the physiques of Dr. Campbell and other vegan authors, but look no further than the travel channel to see tribal elders with strong healthy looking bodies, not the frail looking physique of these guys. It's not an ego thing, but if you follow this diet and begin seeing yourself resembling an cancer patient, please go through some old national geographic pictures and ask if this is normal or healthy. We have a food problem in america that is related to big agribusiness, but this diet really only supports this. Join a CSA, take time to cook/prepare you food, and know where your food comes from.

B00A6D5GBE|5.0|The soundtrack, graphics, and gameplay come together wonderfully to create an almost Tim Burton-like side-scrolling adventure.  My 4 year old son is totally into it, especially thanks to the forgiving gameplay which allows you to revert to a few seconds prior.  At the same time the diverse mechanics and complexity of the puzzles and goals make it completely engaging for adults.  Excellent free app of the day, highly recommended for anyone looking to pay for something so obviously well thought out and executed.

B00ANGICRE|4.0|*This review contains spoilers, but nothing significant that wasn't shown in the trailer*<br /><br />Here's a movie that would never have been made 30 or 40 years ago, because of the subject matter. It's based on the true story of how 38-year-old Mark O'Brien (Hawkes) tried to lose his virginity. What complicates matters is that he spends most of his life inside an iron lung, and he can only leave it for two or three hours at a time. He's a polio victim, and while he's able to feel sensation in every part of his body, his muscles aren't strong enough to enable him to stand. In fact, his emaciated body has trouble remaining straight, even with him lying down.<br /><br />Are you depressed yet? It doesn't sound like a very uplifting story, does it? Actually, it may surprise you.<br /><br />Although Mark's situation is serious, and is treated as such for the most part, the movie is full of humor. Don't misunderstand me; it's not a comedy, but the story of a man who uses humor to enable him to tolerate his limited existence. If you have ever seen The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, you'll know exactly what I mean. As I enjoyed the humor, I wondered whether that's a common defense mechanism for people with physical handicaps, or a device used by the director to make a grim situation more palatable for the audience.<br /><br />We see Mark try a series of caregivers, before eventually settling on Vera (Moon Bloodgood). She's friendly and clearly gets on well with Mark, supporting him whenever she can. Mark decides that he wants to experience sex before he dies, but he's a religious man and doesn't feel comfortable pursuing the idea without the blessing of his priest, Father Brendan (Macy). Macy is great in his role, and gives us a way to hear Mark's thoughts, doubts, and ideas. The exchanges between the two provide many of the movie's highlights.<br /><br />After getting permission to see a sex surrogate, Mark sets up the appointment. This is where things really start to get interesting. He meets Cheryl (Hunt), who is assigned to teach him about sex. There is a lot of nudity from this point on, and the R-rating is justified. If you are squeamish about nudity, or planning on watching it with a young child, it won't be a good choice. The discussions between Cheryl and Mark are frank and to the point, with constant references to sexual practices and terminology. Cheryl says at the outset that she can only meet Mark for a maximum of six sessions, presumably to make it clear that the two aren't entering into a permanent relationship. She's married with a son, and this is her occupation; she's not a prostitute.<br /><br />Put yourself in Mark's position for a moment. It's a natural human need, so why should he miss out? The movie handles the subject well, keeping things serious when they need to be. If the humor had been misplaced, or too frequent, it would have cheapened the story. But the balance is just about perfect, and I found myself empathizing with Mark and rooting for him.<br /><br />It's an adult movie that will make you laugh out loud frequently, and perhaps shed a tear. Hawkes is superb in the role and was unlucky not to be nominated. Hunt gained the movie's only nomination, and her performance was faultless. I liked the characters and appreciated everything about the movie. It's one that I'll probably pick up on Blu-ray in the near future.interesting.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed this Hidden Object/Adventure game. It's just difficult enough to be challenging for us &quot;mature&quot; gamers and not boring for the younger set. I am looking forward to another.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|Great show to watch. Makes me wish I could traverse space and time. Classic show which has been entertaining for many years and still is.
1421550644|5.0|Im not going to review the story here. Im gonna review the quality of the print and the publisher as I read the original translations years back. Two huge hard cover books (dictionary size) with a case is what you should expect of a manga of such epic proportion. Compare this with Viz's separate vol print the pages are gonna be smaller since the separate prints are the size of a magazine each, so if you want a bigger print I suggest go for that instead. The translation from Viz is slightly different than the original and is more consistent and solid over all. However my main problem with this publication is that Viz censored or cut out a few pages to preserve their Teen rating on the manga. I am quite annoyed by this since those details really pops out in terms of reading the story. Overall its a good reprint but for the hardcore readers you would be quite annoyed by Viz has done.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Because of the ending I'm not sure how I will like season 4.  Oh, I will watch it but really how good could it be without Mathew??? Too many characters dying....Thinking they must have something big in store as I'm sure I'm not the only fan dissapointed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was great. ;) :)<br />I couldn't stop reading. A real page turner.  I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I highly recommend Firefly the series as well as the movie version of it called Serenity. Great show. Very entertaining.
1616550414|4.0|Although at the beginning talks a lot of the game TLOZ Skyward Sword, which is a good game, but not my favorite, the book returned then to view all the games from the saga, specially focusing on the timeline, clarifying so much aspects and solving so many questions. The arts are totally awesome, and they make me realize so many details that I missed when I played these videogames. The comic is a great gift. In general, nice, really nice.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Where to begin with this book? John green is an amazing writer. I fell in love with Hazel (main character) and her dry humor and wit. The plot moves along perfectly without giving too much away. The characters are real and unapologetic.  I hope to see this turned into a feature film, and I hope Green is involved to see it through.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie is what is wrong w society.... It's who you know..... No rules any more.<br />Terrible and disappointed that DW would portray such a character.  The only positive of this movie is I didn't waste more money!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I read lots of reviews - good and bad- before purchasing the series.  My opinion as a long term MH counselor is that the folks who hates this book were the same ones who tell grieving individuals to &#34;get over it&#34;!  It is painful to watch Lena and Ethan struggle to process the loss of those they love, and yet, their struggles are age-appropriate and realistic.  As one who believes that if you love someone and they're struggling, you don't just walk away, I loved the fact that Ethan continues to look for a way to bring Lena home even as their world's rules work to keep them separated.  I was up way late again, turning page after page....

The worry if the hostages would ever get releases, it was very difficult times for the US back then.  The movie even seemed like it was filmed back then....I was completely impressed with the accuracy of it all.  It's an awesome movie to watch!
B003VW54QO|4.0|Good movie with Dean Martin, Rick Nelson, Walter Brennan and of course The Duke. Forget the story line it was good, but the singing with Dean, Rick and Walter was just great to me. Did I fail to mention Angie Dickinson, though she has had better acting roles, she was as pretty as ever  and this may have been one of her earliest movies though not sure about that. If amaz could learn how to deliver their movies with out it stopping and pausing every five minutes it would have been even better

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is a really fun movie. Even though the plot and characters are simple, the story is cohesive and the characters are definitely genuine. The end tends to taper but overall a great comedy. One caveat, most jokes are adults only.

044024630X|4.0|The Affair is another riveting Jack Reacher thriller by Lee Child.  We listened to the audiobook read by the talented Dick Hill.  What issues I might have had with the plot are more than made up for by the window on Reacher's past during his Army days.<br /><br />The Affair opens in 1997 with Jack Reacher in his 13th year as an MP, and who is now part of the elite 110th Special Investigations Unit.  When a woman is found murdered near Fort Kehlam in Carter Crossing, Mississippi, Reacher is sent undercover to help with the investigation.  The fort is home to severl units of special forces, and law enforcement isn't sure if the murderer is a soldier or a civilian.  Reacher teams up with Sheriff Elizabeth Devereaux, herself a former Marine.  Reacher discovers that the victim had ties to an influential U.S. Senator who is chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and whose son just happens to be a rising star at Fort Kehlam.  But Reacher soon realizes that the Army is not just stalling, but also stonewalling the investigation.  The Army also tries to cast suspicion on Sheriff Deveraux, with whom Reacher has started an affair.  Finding the truth may mean the end of Reacher's military career, and maybe even his life.<br /><br />As for the plot, it was definitely a stretch in many spots--especially the actions that Reacher manages to get away with.  Also, the sex scenes got tiresome.  But it was great fun to see where Reacher came from and how and why he ended up a nomad with no luggage and carrying only a folding toothbrush, taking buses and/or thumbing rides.  General Leon Garber and colleague Frances Neagely (featured in previous books) also make appearances.<br /><br />The Affair is Child's 16th in this series with only one more novel published at this time--A Wanted Man.  We already have it downloaded for our next long car trip.

0316069434|5.0|Leave it to Michael Connelly to come up with another riveting novel is his Harry Bosch series with his latest book, The Black Box.  The Black Box is the 19th book in this series, and Connelly's 24th work of published fiction overall.  I'm always amazed at the high quality of Connelly's work--unlike some other best-selling authors who write worthless drivel in order to publish as many books a year as possible.<br /><br />The Black Box opens May 1, 1992 during the Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict.  LAPD  Detective Harry Bosch is on the streets trying to process murder crime scenes.  He and his partner are sent to one particularly disturbing murder.  A young, blonde women is dead in an alley with a gunshot wound through her head.  It turns out that she is a Danish reporter, Anneke Jespersen.  Bosch tries to do what he can before he's directed to another victim and the murder of Jespersen is eventually transferred to someone else and remains unsolved.  Fast forward to 2012 and it's now the 20 year anniversary of the LA riots.  Bosch is now part of the Open-Unsolved Unit, where new technology gives investigators the tools to process  DNA, ballistics, and other evidence that wasn't originally available when the crime was committed.  The murder of Jespersen always haunted Bosch, and he now has a chance for a fresh start when the bullet that killed the reporter is traced to another murder with that killer in jail.  At first, Bosch thinks that Jespersen's murder is related to LA gangs, but as he does the \\"gun walk,\\" he discovers that Jespersen wasn't in LA because of the riots, but as part of an investigation that goes back to Desert Storm. The more evidence that Bosch gathers, the more disturbing this murder becomes.  Unfortunately, his lieutenant is a political animal and he doens't want Bosch to solve this crime in 2012 because Jespersen is white, and all the other unsolved murder victims are black.  But Bosch is never one to back away from a case--especially as it is gaining momentum.  Continuing his investigation can cost Bosch not just his career, but also his life.<br /><br />Michael Connelly paid his dues as a crime reporter, and it shows in his novels, his vocabulary, his scenes, his plots and his characters.  Bosch is an old-fashioned, hard-nosed detective who still does things the traditional way.  \\"Bosch charted the killings on a blank piece of paper rather than on a comuputer as most of his colleagues would have done.  Bosch was set in his ways and he wanted a document.  He wanted to be able to hold it, study it, fold it up, and carry it in his pocket.  He wanted to live with it.  He left plenty of space around each entry so that he could add notes as he went.  This was how he had always worked.\\"  Bosch has also been around long enough to have cultivated sources outside the police force, and it is one of these sources who provides Bosch with the \\"black box\\" that will help break this case.  The black box is named after the black box in an airplane which will provide critical data after a crash.  Find the black box, and you'll solve the mystery of the crash.  In crime investigations, the black box is the evidence or clue that will provide the missing piece \\"that brings it all together and makes sense of things.  You find it and you're gold.\\"<br /><br />Michael Connelly is one of the few mystery writers who I will purchase a book as soon as they're published, and he never fails to deliver.  The Black Box is another outstanding effort.  Too bad somebody doesn't turn Harry Bosch into a television series.ly as it is gaining momentum.

1592407889|3.0|I am a big fan of Shirley Maclaine.  I love many of her movies and books.  She changed my life and put me on a spiritual path that otherwise would have not been there.  One small article in Liz Smith's gossip column in 1985 about her book \\"Dancing in the Light\\" and I was off and running.  This had its ups and downs but in the end its all good.  She is not Mother of the Year but she ain't Joan Crawford either.  We all have faults and I'm sure Shirley has her side of the story.  In the end its all about money.  It always is.

Its a trick to humiliate you. A must not get! If I could give it no stars I would. Thank God they don't charge you for it, because it would be stealing!$$$!$$!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this game! Keeps him occupied for hours! I would  recommend for ppl of all ages
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I really enjoy this book. The only complaint I would have is the length of the book, however it is set up as a young adult and was very reasonably priced. The characters are easy to root for and the writing does transport you to land of Thor.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Finally!  Though the first few chapters were a bit slow, this book once again showed the storytelling style I fell in love with in the first few books but seemed to have lost in the previous one. Can't wait for the next!
B009LA1R34|5.0|Thalia has really done it this time.  Thalia Habitame Siempre is an eclectic work of art that narrates Thalias life experiences over a lifetime. Habitame Siempre is composed of excellent quality music and can be enjoyed by both a young and/or a mature audience.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Atmosfera\\", \\"Ojala\\", and \\"Regalito de Dios\\" will have you up and dancing; while songs like \\"Besame\\", \\"Manias\\", \\"Habitame Siempre\\", and \\"Dime si Ahora\\" will sweep you away!<br /><br />Simplemente el mejor trabajo musical de Thalia. Excelentes temas, musica de calidad, una voz dulce, y canciones para todas las edades y gustos.<br />\\"Atmosfera\\", \\"Ojala\\", \\"Regalito de Dios\\", y \\"La Apuesta\\" te pondran a bailar. Mientras que los temas \\"Besame\\", \\"Manias\\", \\"Habitame Siempre\\", y \\"Dime si Ahora\\" te rovaran el corazon!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I must say that this is the first time in a long time and in the last two dozen books I've read that a book<br />Have captured me so completely, the man have found his calling and I am sure that his work are and will be enjoyed by every one who happens to come across his talents.<br />I recommend his work and can personally guarantee that it will be enjoyed by all as much as me
B008673ZAQ|5.0|this continued the story lots of twists and turns and of course the love scenes were great glad the chararters stayed together
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like millions of other viewers all over our planet, I am totally enthralled with this series.  I will have serious withdrawal symptoms after next week's Season Finale, until it starts back up again!  I recommend it without any reservations!  Well done, cast and crew -- excellent job, week after week!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Couldn't help myself, I mean, Will Smith goes time traveling.<br /><br />The movie was solid, just like MiB2, but I've never been one for time travel movies since most of the time they have to follow the traditional guidelines of &#34;WoooooOoOOOo, you could chaaaaaaange the futureeeeeeeee.... if you don't do it right.&#34;
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I thought it was a great movie, but was a little thrown off by the approach they took to time travel paradoxes. It diverged from the norm I've seen in other movies and shows. This of course made it interesting, but also a little odd at times (&#34;Hey! they can't do that&#34;). As a sci-fi lover, I would have liked to see more of the Rainmaker plot line, but that would have distracted from the main theme of the film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a read. I literally couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the rest and if they ever expand
B0019I6WDG|2.0|The first time I watched this film, I was in love with it. Part of that is my weakness for Ellen Page: In my eyes, she can do no wrong. Well, rather, she COULD HAVE DONE no wrong before making this film. Then I watched it again, and my opinion went south. This film is offensively indie. It is obnoxiously quirky, as if the director felt the need to remind the audience with every other line that THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT FILM. Ellen Page's dialogue sounds as if it was written by Hollywood's idea of a 40-year-old mother trying to bond with her child through the use of outdated or irrelevant slang. Michael Cera plays --- surprise --- a socially awkward/inept teenager. Way to escape typecasting!
B003CJMPIG|4.0|Can't complain when a movie is just as it seems: Violence, simple story, and more violence. I do enjoy shotty movies, but this one is still a good one to watch from time to time.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book....looked forward to each chapter.  As soon as I finished the book, I looked for another by the same author.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is a great game with really good graphics.  It runs smooth and so far, I've experienced no glitches.  I also love that it has puzzles as well as hidden object activities.  I highly recommend this game.
0679746048|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. However, I can't help but notice that is basically a re-hash of \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\". Seriously. Still, it is a good movie in its own right, and its resemblance to \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" can partially be chalked up to its source material.
B007NG93CK|5.0|Another wonderfully complex and unusual story from Kathy Reichs.  She never disappoints.  Don't miss this great read.<br />Temp's past catches up for a moment and Ryan shows his vulnerability.
B0060YIBLK|3.0|We hope to learn the title premise and its points are well taken. Sort of a 'you get what you give book' basically true.
B003AYZBM0|4.0|I have not seen the movie with Leonardo Di Caprio, so hopefully that helped. I found the book to be very interesting, a nice story and it kept me guessing a bit as to what was actually happening in the island - although at the end a felt I was expecting a &#34;twist&#34; for some reason I cannot explain.<br /><br />Characters are nicely developed, the writing style is quite easy to follow and casual - the type of book I can read before going to sleep and be sure I'll be able to pick it up again without any backtracking the next day.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love the different game screens and different challenges at each level.  You play against the clock and against the board.  Love it.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Ive been in sales professionally for 12 years and I've read TONS of sales books. And this one trumps them all. I found Pink's synthesis of the research he did for the book helpful, relevant, thought-provoking, and incredibly insightful. I also found the material in the book to be practical - I got tons of ideas for my own business and training my team as I went through. Particularly helpful are the exercises at the end of each chapter. I will be incorporating a lot of this material into my business and my training practices. Thank you Daniel Pink!
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I randomly found these guys, but when I played this album I was blown away.  Not only are they musically articulate and talented, but their songs are hooky and anthemy.  What a nice surprise this was!  Made me get their \\"Set The World On Fire\\" album as well, which turned out to be MORE of a surprise!  Good job, BVB!
B004UPAN6W|3.0|Nice fit for the others... Hue carried it well without his big cast, but it would have been nice to Halle Berry again...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing! the graphics are so awesome its crazy! I thought it was a real horse at first!! go play this game.
B00A3SHW1O|5.0|I bought this for one song... And I love the entire Album<br />It has a little throwback vibe on some of the songs. Good for anything you are doing!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Well done yet again ladies!! This series just keeps getting more interesting and more unforgettable! Into book 3. This series is a must read!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book shows the struggle of teens in a new way, it connects the past and future together. It opens your mind about how one should enjoy life, a must read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is verry fun and cool i coould play this game all day i think every body shoud play
0307719774|5.0|I bought these journals for 5 people at Christmas.  Even if you don't think you are interested in journaling, these are irresistable.  Everyone is having a great time with it and we talk about our answers and have great laughs.  Recipients ranged in age from 24 to 73 so it is a perfect gift for anyone.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I highly recommend this CD. It's rare when you can understand<br />every lyric that's being sung. Since I bought it, I can't stop listening<br />to it...and you will too!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book giving both the positives and negatives of his life.  Definitely a must read for any member of the armed services
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Such an amazing book. I loved it. It tis surely a song of ice and fire. Fantastic. My son loved it
1781164266|3.0|This artbook doesn't include art from Dead Space: Extraction and Dead Space: Ignition as described. In fact it is mostly art from  Dead Space 3, sadly I didn't like DS3 as much as the previous games, so -to me- this is a drawback.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Its an adorable movie that breaths what is Tim Burton. It has an interesting plot and a happy ending.<br />This film is dark, and I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography. Maybe not for young kids, still is a good movie.
B003RV43X4|5.0|I love this move in as a lot of action. But had a few really funny parts Amazon took a time to start the movie
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and sons are hooked on this! Love it!! Acting is great...story line addictive! Can't wait for the next one!
B005IKZ1B0|4.0|I enjoy this album it is really for my kids they like David Guetta so I purchased the album for them
B005K17RU0|5.0|I need accurate temperature to post on my daily log at work, accuweather app is my best bet for getting the most correct temp.. I love it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This one had a tiny bit of plot.  Not much . To much sex in it.  Would not have bought again.
B009K86D86|4.0|Makes you really think about food protection and want to do something about it. Hope others get to see this and want to act
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very incredible. Very addictive and is easy to get the hang of.. Like Temple Run, it has you running,trying not to get caught.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This one was the best of the 3.  It had a plot instead of just sex. So it was the better one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is way better than temple run! Better graphics, cooler obstacles, and a mine that you ride in, and it is way more addicting!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only chapters that was good was 1 and last one.  The book had way to much sex in it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is terrific. No glitches. It is quite user friendly and u don't have to read a bunch of. Instructions before u. Can play.<br />L.P.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. it keeps my daughter entertained, and I lovento watch her play it. really glad I got it.cane loves horses, and loves this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I've ever played!!!<br />My sister likes the game aswell it's her best game ever
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to enter multiple cities where I have family members and see what's happening.  I'm glad I purchased this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway . It defiantly keeps u entertained. I recommend this game to anyone who hates being bored cause this game will keep you on the edge of your seat, trying to beat that pesky high score of yours.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a terrific love story. Love the ups and downs of the developing relationship. I also enjoyed the point of view offered by Christian on the Epilogue.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good<br />Amazing<br />Really action packed and interesting<br />Cliff hanger<br />I really recommend this book so ya  buy it now!!!<br />Really good
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gets intense with sudden changes, so it keep you emotionionally involved. Good story line, good gory effects. Somtimes predictable but it makes up for it. Highly recommend
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a great game. You'll have hours of fun playing. No glitzes. Anyone who loves these type games as much as I do should definitely get this game whether it's free or pay.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is the only battery app I have used so i cant compare it to others. But i guess the main point i hope you will take away from this review is that having used this app for a couple of months now i have no need to try any others.  I think it is great.
B00973902K|5.0|I listen to Call Me Maybe  by Carly Rae Jepsen almost every day.  I can understand why this song is so popular.  One of my favorites!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is really cool because I am trying to save up for this person and I only got 16 days left to get her and its really hard to get the money to buy her so that's why I like that game very much. Oh I also like this game because you can upgrade your things and you can get new characters and boards
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book - easy to read, and hard to put down.  I am glad that someone as well-regarded as this physician has chosen to write about this experience.  Sometimes when we go through something that is so difficult, we do find out that it was for a larger purpose.  I highly recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great! Fun and challenging. I've recommended it to several friends. Pop up ads are a bit annoying.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson brings the Wheel of Time series to a masterful conclusion.  I read the last half of the book in the space of 12 hours.  I couldn't put it down!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I thought I would not like reading books which were not hard copies.  However, I kind that building my kindle library and reading has been a delight.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and I love the variety of ways the cards display when you win.  I like it better than the paid version I have.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|very<br />additive.<br />I enjoy this game but be careful to save hearts to buy more help or u will have to shell out real cash.
B005PK553C|1.0|It did not make much sense to me. Maybe because I did not watch from the beginning of the series.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Nothing that will keep you awake at night. Quick read. Typical damsel in distress story with Prince Charming to the rescue.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I love Twitter but this software is a bit quirky. (Or maybe it's just Twitter.) I find that sometimes it works exactly like I'd like it to and gives me the Tweets from where I left off and other times it'll jump around and make me go back and figure out where I left off on my own. Sometimes while in the middle of reading Tweets it'll jump forward to the newest Tweets and I'll have to go back only to find the older Tweets are no longer there.
B0076DELIG|1.0|I think I have read all of the Harry Bosch books and have enjoyed them all. That is until this one. This book dad so full of unnecessary filer that I had to skip most of it until I finally just gave up on it. The story line just didn't go anywhere. Bought this for my kindle and just returned it for a refund, I hope I get the refund because the book was a total snooze.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It starts out kind of fun, but I've played it for a while now and can't run out of coins anymore. I've pretty much set it aside except for when I'm really bored due to that. For the first few weeks/months it was my ideal, mindless time killer. Then I crossed some sort of threshold and now whenever I play I end up with more coins than I had when I started. I suspect some people would like never running out of coins, but all of the strategy of where to put coins is now gone and I can put them anywhere and still get more than I had to start with.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great! i really love to play with my horse all of  the time! it's a great game to play!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|If you like Sudoku then this is the game for you. I typical play it on the hard level and can solve it in 6-12 minutes without a clue. The next level up gets somewhat mind-bending however. It is nice in that the game will tutor you in how to solve the more advanced puzzles, but I have a hard time wrapping my brain around the method just yet.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I dont just have this original. I have the other two. The new dawn, and valentine's edition. this game is very fun and the more you play the funner(not a real word) it gets. nothing to really say about this.  It is a great free game.  You do not need to pay for anything with this game.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I've bought every Diana Krall CD out there and she never disappoints me. This another in a long, long line of successful CD's.
0120884674|4.0|got this for a forensic class. this is a really good reference book. Since bones do not change, this will never be one of those books that is not needed.
145162607X|1.0|Ugh. I had to slog through this one. It just seemed mired in details that did not advance the story. Is it bad that I enjoyed the author notes more than the actual story? Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors and I love her fictionalized historical tales but this one was a miss for me. :
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I have no issues, you need this to read some PDFs.  it does not cause issues on my Kindle at all. I have this on all of my devices. I have a mac, iphone and a kindle fire, I would use it on my other kindle. but it is not needed.  nothing really to say about this. it is a PDF reader.
B00846REIS|3.0|I found the writing to be excellent and I was intrigued from the start. There seems to be a trend of deeply flawed female characters with hidden issues seemingly waiting for rescue. While there is a hint of this, in Bared to You, our protagonist is no push over. I found Eva refreshing in that she owns her flaws and issues and works to overcome them. Gideon Cross is a polarizing figure that is for sure. He is brooding, direct and powerful. Maybe too direct? But I was won over when Day delved deeper into his character. He's got issues of his own, but we only get a brief glance of this.<br />What kept me from going above three stars is that it ends rather abruptly as if in the middle of thought. I understand that this book is part of a trilogy (another {annoying?} trend), but it just seems unfinished right at the end. There is no hint of a cliffhanger or run up of what may happen next and it just threw me off. Because the writing is good I'm sure I'll continue on the Crossfire journey at some point, but I'm not in too big of a hurry.
0446581348|3.0|I thought I would reach for this more often. but it is just okay.  It is good to get a person started but I just dont reach for it anymore.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Very well done.  Very challenging missions requiring patience and skill. Can't go wrong with this.  It will eat up time like crazy!
B00008DDSC|5.0|this is a great movie. and if you think you may like it, you will love it. I love everything about this movie. it shows how love can be different in many ways.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|It was certainly a surprise to find out this ended up tieing to geather the Alien series of movies and the Predator series with the origin of the Alien species. Well worth watching for anyone that enjoys either of these series of movies.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|If my wife was writing this review, she would give it one star, just because she's not happy with how much time I've been spending playing FPS games on the PS3.  I've been a long-time PC gamer, and I've tried numerous times to play games on console boxes, and I always reach the same conclusion - a joystick is a miserable way to control crosshairs on a shooting game.  There's a little bit of effort and trial-and-error to get the setup just right, but the downloadable configurations available from the manufacturer's website are a great starting place, and then you can just customize to your own needs.  I can now jump from PC to PS3 in the same day, and not have a huge adjustment - all of my keys are the same for both.  I usually keep a printed &#34;map&#34; of the key bindings handy, so that if, in a game, I'm told to hit the triangle key, I can check and see what key on my keyboard that corresponds to.  The mouse control isn't perfect, but it's pretty close, and it's FAR better than using a joystick, and the imperfections are related to the PS3 system and the games, and not to the Eagle Eye box.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Right up until the very end of the film, I never really bought into what the director was trying to say as I guess I simply wasn't expecting the story line and the direction director Robert Zemeckis was taking us. It makes me wonder what dark secrets are hiding in Zemeckis' and/or star/producer Denzel Washington's closet that they felt compelled to make this film.    I was a little disappointed in this film because it wasn't what I thought it would be. As a film that showed a man descending toward his own \\"bottom\\", still unwilling to accept his addictions even after a plane he pilots crashes and kills 4 people, I found it difficult to identify with the Denzel Washington character. This is more unusual than one would imagine, as I am in recovery for 16 years myself and have heard many different stories of despair and salvation in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.    Perhaps it was simply because I had never met a commercial airline pilot in recovery, or perhaps it was because I had long ago accepted that sobriety comes only to those who want it, but in all honesty for over 2 hours I couldn't figure out what Zemeckis was trying to say with the film. In retrospect, I now do and can appreciate the message much better.    As far as films about addiction and recovery are concerned, I was much more affected by the 1988 film \\"Clean and Sober\\", but Washington's performance here is excellent.    Chuck  [...]  [...]
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read Hugh's first Wool book a while back and then turned my attention elsewhere.  Every time I popped up for a new book however, I ran into overwhelmingly positive reviews of the additional segments.  Should I buy just one more? Or jump in with both feet and buy the Omnibus edition?  After reading the entire book in about 3 days the only thought I'm left with is \\"What on Earth was I waiting for\\"?  Wonderful storyline, villians, heros, and I hope more than anything... a few sequels!  True Sci-Fi.  The emotions, actions, and thoughts of normal people thrust into a surreal environment. People you like and people you hate!  I intentionally say almost nothing about the plot or characters to avoid any spoiling it for others. There's a reason why this series gets 5 star ratings almost exclusively. I can't wait to see the movie ;-)<br /><br />Even if you've bought the first few separately, go for it. Hugh is an author well worth supporting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This whole series was excelent I didn't want to read it but then my Goddaughter &#34;forced&#34; me to do it & I have to say I LOVED them all!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|love the charm of this story mixed with historical events of the time<br />i find myself thinking in an English accent the day after i watch (:

B006A9XRWI|5.0|Chet's voice is very calming and this album can pretty much be played at anytime of the day whatever mood you're in! This is just ultra cool music!
B00008LKDY|5.0|This is a welcome addition to my collection. These little gems sparkle and make me want to look at other Vivaldi pieces. It's time to go beyond the Four Seasons. These pieces show compositional variety, the playing is nuanced and exciting, and the SACD recording is superb.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|A wonderful series. Each season is better than the last. The acting, writing and directing are really hitting their stride..
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have seen it many times and wanted to own it. I love animals and the story is not only on how we love, but how the dog loves so unconditional.  Ba
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I'm a big Harry potter fan this was the last one I needed it shipped in two or three days.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game has been around for many years but is still fun to play. Makes you think a few steps ahead.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It will not open. I try but after being on the Imagi screen it goes back to my app menu. it does it on my phone too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I want sure if I would like this but my friend recommended it to me.....I really enjoyed it!! I have read it 18 times through and will continue to read it...I recommend it to anyone who likes an action sorry with a little love story twist incorporated within.
0790729709|5.0|This was the first time I watched the movie from beginning to end.  It was great with suspense, action and love.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I havn' gotten anywhere with this game , but my 6 yr. old grand daughter loves and does very well scoring.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie did none of the other Bourne movies justice. It was actually very boring. It did not keep my insterest at all. Very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hate I hate I hate the stupid app deleted by itself and the stuff is to much money ahhhhhhh!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is a new addiction.  It is so easy to get involved with this family and friends.  There is something intriguing and endearing about every character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Th  subway surfers game is a good game if you like temple rum you will like this game it is a mix of speed skill puzzle of is just a very good game you will like it
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|This album is all intensity! It seems like so many bands are so concerned with making their albums attractive to more than just their usual fan base. While thats not always a bad thing,these bands end up alienating many fans by becoming something else entirely. It's not enough that the fan base is mostly guys so bands like Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, etc. lighten up at least half their album, if not all of it, to appeal to the girlfriends of the guy fans. Hatebreed doesn't give a damn about all of that and continues to deliver their trademark sound of relentless and unapologetic hardcore brutality. This is refreshing amongst so many sissy bands. I liken their continuity and consistency to that of Lamb Of God. This is a killer album! Anyone rating this album at anything less than 5 stars is nothing but a metalcore fanboy that wants the growling and yelling interrupted with unnecessary clean vocal harmonies like so many other bands have opted to do. Any true Hatebreed fan will love this album. Don't be cheap and pirate the album! BUY IT! You won't be disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Ok, yes, this game is VERY fun, and you can go a Long way without spending ANY money. I was at level 45 and had at least 100k and was going to spent it on some more ponies and decorations. I was very close to unlocking everything. (I was a level 45) Then, randomly, my kindle fire restarted itself.  When it turned back on, i heard princess Celestia's voice. and I said.<br />\\" This better not do what I think its doing\\"<br />and oh yes, it was, the game I spent my entire weekend playing, was deleted. I would have cried but I just disabled the game. omfg stupid!!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is so unique, I didn't think I would like it as much as I did.  It did tend to drag out a bit, but I enjoyed it thoroughly!
0307394549|5.0|no easier way with pictures and more precise ingredients. unlike other books that ask or require over the top ingredients or explain things to where you need to follow with a dictionary. baking made simple. good tool to teach baking for little girls or birthday parties. since im a proud father of a beautiful daughter myself.
B00821OX98|3.0|Great idea, poorly executed...  Example, aliens advanced enough to get here, but they can't spot multiple &#34;campfires&#34; at the refugees hideout.  Nor can they see a large convoy driving down the road with their lights on.  Even we have infrared/night vision tech...
1401233791|5.0|Book was well done. Does have slow parts where Batman fights boring villians and it does not have the story where Bane fights Croc twice along with the Riddler. Bane has a very good backstory. It does show that he is a coward because he waited until Batman was weak before he went and beat him up. Beat him up in his own house. The new Batman is very tough and no joke. He goes all out.
0393327345|5.0|The unnamed narrator's job is horrific and he acts laissez faire. He is part of a huge corporation involved in this horror and it's apparently taken as all so mundane. He has insomnia and no wonder. When a society can allow such abuse for the profit of the few, that society is sick. Yet those most powerful among us, young men, have to act like wimps, like women if I, and the author may be so blunt. He says in one scene that a generation of men raised by women ... he doesn't think that another woman (marriage and family) is the answer. Conciliatory, kind, efficient in a small obedient way, NICE ... it reminds me of the movie \\"The Defiant Ones\\" where the character played by Sidney Poitier wishes he could communicate to his wife the rage he feels at being an exploited black man. He says, \\"Angry? I've been angry all my life.\\" So have I. Wouldn't it be \\"nice\\" if we were allowed to really act naturally? To tell a bully, that they are a bully to their face instead of stifling or backbiting and pretending everything is alright. Everything is not alright. The narrator finds solace at support groups of other horrific scenes (testicular cancer, brain parasites, blood parasites) and just melts in tears on the huge mommy breasts of a victim. Sleep at last. Tears that have been denied. Denial, restraint, \\"professional\\" demeanor, inner despair and rage, suicide or murder, certainly prayers for vengeance. Are we still men (or women)? What are our choices: devo or Columbine? What a mix and ready to blow up, which is where this novel takes us. A great novel that \\"sacrifices\\" nothing to present the possibility of heroics, good and bad. Maybe, it's just possible, that sometime, somewhere, this outgrown system of capitalism will be discarded, defeated, fried and pushed out the window.
044042321X|1.0|Book was awful! It did not have the whole first season. Book only has parts and then it ends on a stupid part. Waste of a book! Avoid at all cost. Need to make a whole big ominibus book that is huge and has the whole season than to read this crap! Art was very good but the book sucked!
B0030DIP7O|5.0|great set, these are 3 of the top 5 scorps cds all in one nicely priced package. uli jon roth will shread you to death!!
1563894696|5.0|This book is worth the hype! It is a very good story about Two-Face taking out all his enimies and Batman trying to stop him! Two-Face shows why he is one of Batman toughest villians. A must read for all people who love Batman and his books!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I have discovered a TV program that doesn't throw murders or other mayhem at me each week. A show that is at least literate.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|This was a very good series. Full of a lot of twists and turns and good players. Has you on the edge of your seat. Drawback is by the last season there are a lot of filler episodes and a lot of stuff stuff repeats it self and the action scences are weak. The story does get weak at the end. Still a very well done series. Worth buying.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app was very disappointing didn't do what I expected. It failed to open on my kindle for several times.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to say after reading all the reviews, my review is this. This book takes you to a place we all visit or visting, being it was part of our past or happened in our past but, clearly Colleen Hoover was very dedicated to make this a readable and sweet book that all could sit back and read till you couldn't read anymore, the last page which ended in a way that we all hoped for. Now the nay sayer that this was not very well written, if you ever were 17, 18, or mid 20 or your there now, this book is amazing and caring, and thoughtful to all that pick the book up. I'm so happy it was recommended to me to read, everyone has a past and everyone has to move forward thanks to hopeless that we are NOT hopeless. Loved it!!!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I'm having \\"Fraser withdrawl\\" since I finished this book a few weeks ago. Diana does a wonderful job of telling an action packed love story. Sometimes I can't put this book down and I definitely can't wait to pick it up again. I like that there aren't any dry spots of idle chatter or dull spots to skip over. If you skip over any parts in this book, you will miss vital information!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|The Scarpetta books are my favorites. I have read all.of this.series. Patricia Cornwell is my author. I enjoyed this a book very much.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it doesnt work on my nook! it keeps closing and never gets past the imangi studios screen. im very dissapointed.
B008IYR2BA|2.0|This was easily the worst dexter season I've seen. The characters just didn't work, they weren't scary or creepy enough. Watching Deb evolve was the only thing that made it worthwhile. I hope season 7 will be better.
B0026KQ1WS|4.0|I ordered the movie to watch on my Kindle during a flight, and was completely captivated the whole trip.  I don't like flying, so considering that, maybe I should've given it 5 stars.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Awesome love story! Definitely recommend reading! The book keeps you interested and on the edge! Such a great ending! Nicholas Sparks wrote a good one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game keeps the kids entertained and they love it.  Much improved over Temple Run 1 because you can earn coins to get new characters.  Great game!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|After hearing about Chris's untimely death, I had to read this book. After hearing or reading various stories in the media, it was refreshing and fascinating to read his first hand accounts of how he served our country in this fight/war in the Middle East. I also appreciate how he and his wife intersperse the tale with their own personal struggles of marriage and family. I think this book will be an encouragement to those who may be contemplating going into the military, those who are active and are experiencing similar hardships and for those who are thinking about being Navy Seals and may want to get a taste of what lies ahead. It is a fun read and also a hard read when you think of how much these men sacrifice and give as they represent the USA. I am glad he and others put this book together and revealed how messed up our politicians are as they try to run this war.
B003V5K0AQ|5.0|I had seen the remake and it was fun to watch where the movie originated. Even my young kids enjoyed the nostalgia.
B005CKPQ7A|4.0|I had trouble getting this download to work correctly with my TIVO, and consumer service was extremely helpful.  At one point I gave up & they refunded my money!  When I figured out what I was doing wrong, I ordered it again with no problem.<br /><br />I just wish that the download included captions.  Especially on show like this where people are screaming at each other with guns blazing one minute, then whispering or mumbling the next, captions are a great help.
B004FPZ2LI|5.0|This is, of course, a classic...and a must read. Take your time and enjoy. It helps to have a list of the characters so you can keep everyone straight.
B005DNBDXM|3.0|This film is a typical end of the earth disaster film.  It really has nothing in it that rises above average.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Brilliant layout! I love the slide to dim feature, it is awesome that the weather information is right there on the screen with the clock, and the settings are intuitively located...The one flaw is that the &quot;keep screen on&quot; function kills my battery before morning. I even had the screen completely dimmed. This was on my Kindle Fire 7&quot;.  I like the alarm enough that I will probably install it on my Phone next and will hopefully not see the same issue.<br /><br />I like it and I definitely recommend that you try it (on a night where don't need to be at work the next morning) and see if it works for you. like I said, it has a really nice layout...
B008ROG1QI|4.0|Good insight to the life of bomber crews.  Realistic portrayal of the ages of these crews and their lives in conflict.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very good and true read. Your heart breaks for ALL the characters who are affected by mental illness. Touching!

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel played an alcoholic so well that I had trouble finishing the movie because I was so lost in his character.  He is the greatest.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|I do not like this app. I bought this for my 4 year old who is obsessed with the animals that repeat everything you say. This particular one has a creepy voice and it makes me uncomfortable. The dog sounds like he is intoxicated. Not a good pick.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I recently bought this item on sale I love this incredible trilogy (The third one has grown on me) and seeing the films look this great brings a warmth to my movie buff heart. The colors are bright and vibrant and the grain is just right not too grainy. Most of the features are carried over from the dvd's but i didn't have the dvd of part 3 so I enjoyed hearing the commentary track for that film. Overall you can tell a lot of love and care was put into this restoration and set and the packaging is great comes with the slipcover and plastic case. So if you love this series and already own the DVD's it is well worth the upgrade.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|My kids aged 4, 9,  and 12 all giggled there way through it. My wife and I caught ourselves laughing as well.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|What a great film people have there opinions about this film I know people who hated it and people who absolutely loved i'm one of the people who loved it. Incredible performances all around Denzel Washington and John Goodman stole the show in my opinion but everyone was so great that it was hard to say who gave a better performance. The Blu Ray looks very good the first 20-30 minutes are what I think attracted people to this movie and it just looks so good on this release. The features are really good theres nothing that really stands out for the most part what you'd expect from behind the scenes features. If you enjoyed this movie i would recommend that you add it to your collection
1450419895|5.0|The book is truly amazing. It provides you with lots of training tips that many books out there does not. In fact, you be surprised that there are many training tips that even gym instructors may not share or are aware of. This book is not only for the novice, but all gym-goers at all levels.<br /><br />Besides the cool pictorial illustrations of the various muscles, the author clearly let the reader makes their own decisions which kind of movements during training would be best through explaining the pros and cons. For example, should we put our feet on the bench or the floor during bench presses? Should we bring the bar all the way to our chest? Rebound? or simply push it up? You be surprised that common school of thought that we should be touching the bar on your chest is not suitable for everyone...anyway want to know the answer? Buy this book :)<br /><br />The book is also divided into different muscle groups, with clear explanation on the types of exercise you can do. This book also highlights the types of injuries that are likely to occur for certain types of movements. In fact, this is something which most books do not cover. I am most keen on this area for I have long suffered some tendon injuries myself, and this book now made me understand why those injuries occur, and what I could do to prevent it.<br /><br />I have not finish reading this book but its really great so far. The author does use some scientific terms or names that you may find a little dry / confusing / boring. But beyond this, the illustration and explanation are what make this book unique.<br /><br />Truly, the one gym book that I will not put down.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|So Peter Pan is finally released in the Diamond Edition is it worth is YES. Look I know this film has been released in so many different formats before it's hard to count and yes I have owned a couple of those editions but this is the first time I have owned it on Blu Ray and let me tell you this is the best it has ever looked. Peter Pan was released 60 years ago and with this release it looks like it was made yesterday. The packaging is beautiful I love that image of Big Ben and the shadow of peter. The features include some never before seen deleted scenes/songs in storyboard form but still very interesting the rest are mostly carried over from the dvd releases and it also includes mini games whenever you pause the film which is something I have not seen before and might be fun for the young ones very cool. If you love Peter Pan like I do (very nostalgic great memories) than this is a definite pickup/upgrade.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Daft Punk's concept album was panned when it was released, but now all the fools are realizing. Come on people, it is a genius album that was a direct commentary on our society and still is.  Daft Punk changes it up every album, you can't be comparing it to past ones: apples vs oranges.
1616550414|5.0|This is basically a book of concept art. It focuses on skyward sword, but has at least a little from all the games. I was happy with the lore included, it even has some breakdowns of the in game languages. Nothing in this blew my mind but it was good buy and has inspired another round of playing through every game. It's definitely a good resource for any RPG planning or sketching.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have heard through the forums that you have to use this paste with any heatsink that has copper coming in direct contact with the processor.  This stuff works extremely well, and a little bit goes a really long way so be careful about how much you apply.  I used this on my C2Q9550 and it has kept it extremely cool so far.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|A really fun movie, if you can ignore that people are controlling tiny avatars with great precision using only a keyboard then watch this movie.

B002GYI9C4|4.0|A little tedious around the middle; a few unexpected twists toward the end. Definitely enjoyable enough to continue reading the series.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|By sense we all share that of hurt feelings from friends but from those we consider family cut the deepest and sometimes can not be forgotten even though forgiven.  We should all learn a thing or two from the characters in this book. A wonderful read and a lesson for all.
0345525558|2.0|I loved this book for the first 150 pages or so.  So much so, that I couldn't put it down. Then in the middle, the story got... dumb!! The main character (Victoria) became annoying and stupid.  The events from the middle of the book on were unbelievable and far-fetched. Disappointed.
0205313426|5.0|awesome tips on writing. very in-depth. certainly not for a lazy mind, it goes very deep into writing and good language. (as you can see I'm still learning to incorporate it into my daily life lol)
0307477479|5.0|I went into this book only knowing that it was somewhat related to the music industry, and I found an incredibly moving collection of stories linked by the interactions and relationships of their characters and by their overarching theme: nostalgia, memory and how our pasts affect and haunt our lives.<br /><br />It is deeply emotional, and (like Proust, who apparently inspired Egan here) it succeeded in nearly replicating for me the actual experience of nostalgia: longing, aching, resignation and regret, but, ultimately, a kind of beauty in the sense that these experiences make us who we are. For better or worse.<br /><br />The structure of linked stories written in diverse styles was unexpected and imaginative and very effective. They each could stand on their own as short fiction. I have been a fan of Jennifer Egan since Emerald City and The Invisible Circus came out when I was just a kid, and this is surely her most accomplished work yet. It is also a quick and engaging read.<br /><br />A note on readability of \\"the PowerPoint chapter\\" on Kindles: First, I found it completely readable on my Paperwhite, although yes the print is small. I also have this book in hardcover, which has one slide per page.<br /><br />That said, I chose to watch the entire slideshow on !! EGAN'S WEBSITE JENNIFEREGAN.COM !! (look for the \\"Great Pauses...\\" link on her home page). It allows you to experience the story as an actual PP and also includes some audio. I highly recommend this.<br /><br />(When you're done with the book, her website also offers up her thoughts on some of the stories, including her inspiration for them and synopses of stories that ultimately didn't make the book. I found this very interesting. I also wasn't ready to let go of some of her characters when I was done with the book, and this let me hold on a while longer.)<br /><br />The PP chapter, which has gotten quite a bit of attention and some flak, easily transcends its form. The PP format makes complete sense in the context of the story, but a few slides in and you almost forget how you're experiencing the story. You just are. It was the first and only time a PowerPoint has brought tears to my eyes.n the context of the story, but a few slides in and you almost forget how you're experiencing the story. You just are.

B00A757EFW|2.0|Loved the arcade game and the Nintendo(?) version, but don't like playing on my Kindle. No control on either method offered; even with the hints it was very frustrating. Will give it another chance, but will probably delete. Younger folks may have the dexterity to operate the control?
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Too hard to read and nothing like the movie, musical, etc.  I think this is the original written version and is hard to understand.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! I haven't played the first one, but I bet people who bought that game thought it was great, too. Thank you amazon for putting this app on Kindle Fire!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fresh. Witty. Funny. Sarcastic. Honest. I laughed out loud and felt like Tina was an old friend sharing stories. If you're a fey fan. This is a must read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down. Loved all the twists and turns! Bravo Colleen Hoover on an amazing novel.
B00932A3SK|4.0|It is a smarter movie than it is being described.<br />The plot is more complex and the hero is not an action hero.<br /><br />worth watching.
1451695195|1.0|A very tiny part of the book is about the Doctor's NDE, but the account of the NDE does not go beyond simple profound wisdom, it seems flat and \\"generic\\", in lack of a better word. I read better NDE accounts on many other places elsewhere. The actual NDE experience in this book might fit on a single page.<br /><br />The rest of the book is the constant repetition of the fact how his Neocortex was not working and how the NDE as such was not possible.<br />For me, it looks like that Doctor tried to deliberately fill the book to reach a certain number of pages. This is astonishing given such an experience.<br /><br />The title is entirely misleading and again proof that there might be other reasons behind the book, short: Money<br /><br />* The book will disappoint spiritual and new age-leaning people. It can really not bring anything new to the table, beyond a VERY FLAT and generic experience, without any further insight, questions, philosophy etc.<br /><br />* The book will disappoint scientists and skeptics. Aside from the misleading title \\"Proof....\\" there is no proof given, in fact the book is astonishingly unscientific given the author is a Harvard studied Neurosurgeon. The repeated saying how his Neocortex was not working and the NDE should have not been possible is not scientific. Even more astonishing, the doctor claims he was in a coma and his entire condition and the amazing awakening was from a medical point of view impossible. There is no explanation or even attempt of an explanation what his condition really was and also how it was possible that he awoke from the coma and then recovered. Any other scientist/doctor could likely have written a much \\"better\\" book with more details about the condition....as opposed to making claims like he did about his non working brain...but without ever going into detail.<br /><br />* The book will disappoint religious people. Again where the hyped title comes in \\"Proof of Heaven\\". If i WERE a religious person I would havebeen disappointed with that rather \\"generic\\" and flat experience looking for this \\"proof of heaven\\", except there is none in the book. Am I right that this \\"OM\\" entity is supposed to be God/The Creator - but then there is an astonishing lack of a description or even \\"excitement\\" about the OM entity. I am pretty sure If i were to to speak to \\"The Creator\\" myself, this alone would merit an entire book, here in the book he mentions \\"OM\\" in one/two lines and then goes on with entirely different things, mostly related to him (the doctor) and his condition, rather than the experience.<br /><br />How the book got so many good reviews is beyond me because I cannot see that this book would satisfy ANY of the above, be it religious, spiritually inclined people or scientists/skeptics who look for good literature on the subject.<br /><br />The other thing which I found odd is that the author does not come across as similar people who had such an experience, where the experience humbled them or opened up philosophic questions etc..etc..... as someone else already said, the book *almost* reads like some intended script for a movie, rather than a true account of someone who had such an experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a simple game, but it is quality entertainment. Very realistic and good fun for being a free game. I work would definitely recommend it.

B00942G4UA|4.0|Frightening look at where our food comes from!  I can't look at my chicken sandwich nowadays without seeing all those poor birds crammed in a dark shed unable to stand up because of the heaviness of their genetically engineered huge breasts.  Everyone needs to see this.  It will change the way you think about your food.  I would have given it 5 stars, except that I really don't like the reality that it reports.  Well done documentary.
B006LSZECO|1.0|this is the worst book i have read in a long time. i was going to put it down several times but decided to force myself to finish it. it was written like the author sat down to write and did not remember where they left off. hard to keep up and difficult to stay engrossed. i like a book that i dont want to put down. i could barely pick this one up.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|This is a solid effort by New Order, which is made even better if we consider that the songs included here are leftovers from their last proper album (Waiting for the Sirens' Call - WftSC). It serves as a reminder of the greatness that was (is?) New Order, and makes us miss them more. Furthermore, considering that WftSC was a rather uneven album, this new offering is, probably, better than it.<br /><br />This is a rather short album, with 8 songs, including a mix of an already released track. I do not think that it was ever finished properly: the songs all sound fine, but they are more straight forward rock offerings compared to the traditional NO efforts. Maybe they were meant to be the perfect-sounding demos, waiting for a rich production, to elevate them to the level of Technique or Republic. We'll never know, I guess.<br /><br />Nevertheless, what we have here are 8 solid tracks that add to the legend of the band. Personally, I find Recoil to be the standout track, followed closely by Sugarcane, and I was extremely impressed by the mix of 'I told you so': New Order meet Venus in Furs (Velvet U) to give us an outstanding Spiritualized-sounding track. Everything else is solid though, starting track 'I'll stay with you' brings back memories of Regrets, California Grass is outstanding in its simplicity, everything is fine.<br /><br />I remain unconvinced that New Order is not the best band ever, and I hope that they can put their personal issues aside and grace us with another offering.
1594487154|5.0|There I was on a rainy and cold September day reading the last words of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman with my 12th grade students. Tears actually flowed down the face of a student with Aspergers and the class remarked how truly sad this story is.<br /><br />From that point on I realized that Willy and I share a lot in common. I don't sell out of a suitcase nor travel door-to-door, but as a teacher, I am what Daniel Pink calls the modern salesman.<br /><br />I sell lessons, I sell my clout as a teacher, and I must sell motivation. If my clients don't buy the product, it's a lose lose situation.<br /><br />I absolutely love the rich content Daniel Pink delivers again in this new book.

0316228532|1.0|Casual Vacancy - VACANT<br />At last I finished `The Casual Vacancy'.  Even giving it a one is difficult.  Usually a book like this goes on my never to read ever shelf.  Unfortunately I listened to other readers that said if you finish the book, it comes together.<br />No, it does not come together.  The dialogue is weak for all the characters.  That was also a problem; there are far too many characters.  The story would have been better if only one or two families would be the focus.  As a reader, I was never drawn into the story.  I never found a plot or a character I could grab onto and hold.<br />If Rowling wanted to show dysfunctional families, a novel should not have been used.  She should have written a paper and submitted it to `Psychology Today'.<br />There is no doubt we are a sick society, a selfish society, and a cruel society, but I can watch the news to see this.<br />I don't know about other readers, but I like to go into a story and become one with it, it doesn't matter if it is light or dark.  I enjoy a strong plot, good dialogue, and strong characters.  This novel had none of the above.  It seemed to be a chopped up collection of characters with poor dialogue and poor story.  It seems ridiculous that it took so long to write.  It also seems to me that it was written here and there at different times.<br />Some could say I didn't understand the symbolism.  They would be correct because I couldn't even find any symbolism.  I couldn't find a strong character, a plot, or a story.

014241543X|5.0|\\"If I Stay\\" by Gayle Forman<br /><br />I own this book and this review is solely my honest opinion.<br /><br />What an emotional ride! This Young Adult novel was intense on many levels. There was an unlikely teenage romance between a rocker and a cellist, amazingly loyal friends, and an unspeakable tragedy. \\"If I Stay\\" had so much going on, and Gayle Forman handled it wonderfully. The writing was so beautiful and strong. The author artfully packed each word with such emotion, and the end result was beyond fabulous. This was one YA novel that is great for both teens and adults. Although the reading age begins at YA, the subjects were real and intense for any age.<br /><br />Due to a dusting of snow, school is cancelled and Mia and her family decide to go for a drive and meet some family friends. Unfortunately, what started as a good natured and innocently fun-filled day, turned into the stuff of nightmares. An intense car accident tore Mia's family apart. Throughout the events unfolding after the accident, Mia was witnessing everything - and not because she was okay and there. Mia suffered tremendous injuries, including a coma...however, she was seeing and hearing everything going on around her, just as if she were standing in the same room as everyone. Mia's real body lay near lifeless in the hospital, while the \\"other Mia\\" was able to check on her family and friends and experience their grief. She learned these people really loved her, except the people she really loved the most were gone. How is she going to get through life without her family? She learns it may be her choice whether she lives or dies, and in the moment of Mia's grief she doesn't know what she wants - though she knows what will be easiest. Find out Mia's life or death decision in Gayle Forman's \\"If I Stay.\\"<br /><br />I could barely fathom the grief in this novel. The very idea of losing my family, especially in such a sudden and horrible way, gives me chills. I cannot imagine what my life would be like, and I don't even want to think about it. Even though \\"If I Stay\\" is a work of fiction, situations like this unfortunately happen in real life. I'm not sure if the outer-body experience is real - though I personally believe in it - but what if it was real? Can you imagine how incredibly hard it must have been for Mia knowing she lost her family? Needing to decide whether she should be strong and live, or hope that she reunites with her family if she dies...I don't think I'd have the strength to make such a heavy decision.<br /><br />This is a story that will tug at your heartstrings and remind you to appreciate what you have in life. It makes you want to never take anyone or anything for granted anymore because in a blink of an eye on an ordinary day - it could all be gone. I really try to live by that anyways from my own experiences in my life; I have been without things and people that on an average day I may take advantage of and forget the value in. Sometimes you never know what you have until it is gone...I was fortunate enough to get things back and I don't want to ever let go again.<br /><br />Your emotions will go for a ride during \\"If I Stay\\" by Gayle Forman. You'll be smiling and laughing one moment at a memory of Mia's, and crying in the next second. Gayle Forman is a genius and created a novel that will thaw even the coldest of hearts. I definitely recommend buying and reading this 5 STAR tale of love, grief, tragedy, and strength. I will be reading more of Gayle Forman's work, including \\"Where She Went,\\" the sequel to this book.<br /><br />Brianna Lee Book Reviews<br />[...]e like, and I don't even want to think about it.

0307950654|2.0|I'm having problems finishing this work. Other critics have said it better, but I'll just add that I believe PD James altered the characters from the original book to suit her plot. Charlotte Collins becomes slightly petty. Colonel Fitwilliam becomes a controlling bore with a penchant for Georgiana Darcy only because she has money. There was none of the magic between Elizabeth and Darcy. Granted this was not a romance, but why use a classic if you aren't going to utilize these connections? Otherwise, just write a traditional murder mystery. Very disappointed.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love these games I have two of the mahjong games I play them everyday.  I hope there are some new Artifacts games coming.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this for my son. He is a big fan of Batman movies & asked for this as a gift.  It was obviously well received.
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and am now reading the second book of three.  This is not spam.  I really liked this book.
B000P1KTW8|5.0|My son asked for this as a gift.  We are both big fans of Bruce. Nice dvd.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I like mystery search and find games and this one is as good as the rest. Had I been purchasing it I would not have paid more than a dollar. I just can't see paying more than that for a game I complete in no more than 6 hours. The only complaint I have is that the screen is a little sensative. When you try to in large or move the screen it acts as if your selecting an item so just don't be to quick or it will take seconds off of the timer
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This product protects iPhone 4's very well.  I like the color too.  Rubber iphone cases are better than plastic ones.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book isn't about Steve history written from his own perspective, is completly checked with the all stakeholders with diferents opinions and reviews, I like Isaacson method to write a biography.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|I happened to catch this concert on the Palladia channel and was absolutely blown away by Florence's voice. The cathedral setting illuminated the magnificence of her voice. This deluxe set includes the DVD of that performance and you owe it to yourself, a die-hard Florence fan or never-heard-her-before newbie like I was, to watch and listen to this performance. I am now a die-hard Florence and the Machine fan because of this musical perfomance.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Hitting pretty close to home, the human story told here is more than just powerful. Maybe it could even be life-changing. I recommended it to a close family member and I did have a hidden agenda. Denzel Washington is either one of the best actors of our time or he has some personal experiences we didn't know about. (Maybe it's both of these.)<br /><br />WOW!! You may want to stop watching about halfway through the movie but stick around for the ending. It is worth it!  It's about time our media provided an uplifting message rather than just gyrating body parts.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show ever. It was great to watch this show on Amazon, since Netflix did not have it, yet. Yeah.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids just can't put down this game. Very entertaining.The sounds are very funny and I see them smile all the time.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|At last a book that gets me pumped up and excited with the prospect of getting bigger, leaner and stronger,,, a perfect pun but the title hits the spot and the contents do too. its a no nonsense read that makes it clear on exactly what its trying to acheive and how to do it,,i am looking very much more excited about this year after discovering this, i cant wait to get started,, well actually,, i already have..
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm very surprised my kids spent hours playing, it is the best babysitter for tablets. Even my wife plays and I could do some  extra work without been botherered by anyone. They all have tablets.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|the sharpener is perfect. It does not need a lot of work to make the blade to cut better than it was new.Thanks.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Totally enjoying this. Never listened to her other work. This isn't horribly poppy or simple, it's heady. Great songwriting.<br /><br />Makes me think of Cat Power, another great song writer.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best jigsaw puzzle app.  Besides what is included in this package, you can choose from many other free puzzles.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves jigsaw puzzles.  You do choose between rotating pieces or not.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This booked swallowed me up from the very beginning.  It constantly left me on the edge of my seat, that I felt a little disappointed that there was not more of a climax.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Kind of slow going, but has a good story. Sucks getting old, but being older usually means wiser. Nice ending.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is an excellent, gripping show, I love it. Kevin Bacon does an awesome job, as well as the killer.
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|My title I think says all.  I really liked her soft heartbroke rendition of NY NY.  Less impressed with his version of an emo meltdown...but the director made him hit bottom way out in the wide open lonesome landscape.  I'd of liked to see him at least attempt to gain some understanding...and in the end this is only implied as a possibility - but you know he has to chase her again because, like any good addiction, his heart may know better, but his head (ego) says THIS time WILL be different!<br />Peace.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|Well made game with smooth graphics way too simple of a game ultimately very boring and deleted. It took me one full day to complete all the levels of play just during free time.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|Loved the book! Very enjoyable and entertaining! Couldn't put it down which is very rare for me! Would recommend it to family and friends!
B005R32L66|3.0|I love this app on my IPAD 2!!!! i originally downloaded this on my cell phone when I had the Galaxy 2. It would not work. I tried it on my new Galaxy 3 and I still can't seem to make it work. But the app I got on Itunes for  this works wonderful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so awesome!I was addicted within five minutes. I can not wait to beat the missions.
B005NJ2K6U|3.0|I was not very happy about purchasing this app for my iphone and then I had to purchase it again for my Kindle.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|i like it, is fast enough, small, reliable, the only down thing is that doesnt have wifi, camera or video outputs...the newer version has some improvements..but this is nice enough
B001SKB1Y0|4.0|I thought this movie was refreshing in that it did not<br />attempt to follow the standard romance story framework at all. There were many humorous moments but it was a drama w a clear message.<br />And, anyone who is upset w Javier Bardem's character's womanizing and blatant use of his charms to get any and all women in the sack...is probably missing that message. Yes, it was an entertaining movie.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|It seems to finish up some story lines or at least explains them.  Starts a new story line but really doesn't go anywhere with it.  The end of the story makes it sound like, it is going to be a long time before we get another Pendergast novel.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Was kind  of suspicious to read this book at first. Haven't heard of the author but it turned out to be a pretty good book.

B00A8ECU24|2.0|To many areas that pop up, for my three year old to click on and cause me to have to pay for additional items.  One item my daughter clicked on would have cost me $49.00. I removed the game one day after installing it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The story just keeps getting better!!!!! It blows Twilight out of the water! My new favorite series!!!!! It's a must read!!!
B00ANW33CM|4.0|This is a good game with great graphics, but I found it a little to hard on my eyes after playing it for an hour.
B008DVJOYG|3.0|I liked one song on this album. I could have gotten the song off the internet for free but I like making sure that artists get royalties for their hard work.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is awesome app I recommend to anyone especially people who love horses or own there own (like me) get this app now it is addictive and fun sometimes used as a time waster though as very good at that
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game i ever played.  They have a new update with armor and signs which i was so excited about.  I recommend this game to all ages and if your thinking about getting it just get it because its the best game you will ever find.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It's like X-files meets Lost.  Very intelligent, and love the &#34;realistic&#34; fringe science.  Highly recommended for any sci-fi fan, or people that love a good plot.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|A very exciting video at the beginning of the video.  Very intense the remaining time.  Washington does an excellent job in his role.  Would be an excellent video for alcoholic and druggies to see, but also entertaining for the general viewers.  Not recommended for children though.
B009L7MD44|4.0|Ok, here are a few tips for getting this item to work properly.    1. You might want to get a good third-party media player. For my iPhone I am using OPlayer lite. You will need to go to \\"File Servers\\" and input the IP address found here:[...]    2. You might get a file structure like this:  1-artist-title  10-artist-title    So you may have to rename your files like this:  01-artist-title  02-artist-title    etc.    You can do this with Mediamonkey. On later versions you might have to use <Track#:2> to get double digits with single digit numbers.    3. And be sure to change your phone's Wifi network to the USB port.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This was as thrilling and  attention captivating as any piece of fiction I can remember. Kearns weaves a complex tapestry of the character ofMr. Lincoln,revealing him to be politically savvy, compassionate and understanding of human dynamics, and a truly brilliant man, maybe our best president.  She paints a  frustrating, tantalizing picture of McClelland, Stanton, and Seward, making their challenges to Mr.Lincoln agonizing as they develop, and serve as a challenge to his brilliance,which he answers with a full understanding of their motives characters.  I knew, of course, when the assasination would occur, but kept hoping that somehow it would not.  A great read!
B00AFQC4QC|4.0|This book, a historical romance came as a pleasant surprise.<br />The plot line is simple, can Jews stay out of the hands of Nazi Germany when anti Semitism is at a high? The subplot was amazing.<br />The author plays off prejudice against a continent in a constant state of change with their people a diaspora group of settlers.<br />In such a Europe, where do you turn to? The fact that you were born Jewish but are not a practicing Jew must count for something, must it not? Surely it will.<br />But in a world where your neighbor on the one side is German and the other is for now, Romanian, who can you trust?<br /><br />Cleverly woven into the plot and the main subplot is yet another prejudice, this one based on sexual preference and how do you trust your neighbors,<br />not with only your familial heritage but with a sexual preference that in the day saw practitioners as much persecuted as the Jews!<br /><br />I loved that toward the end of the book the salvation as perceived by the persecutors at times against the protagonists and at others,<br />it is the persecutors that turns into the role of savior.  Seldom, it seems, are things the way they seem.<br /><br />The author then brilliantly introduces another prejudice although this one is used to the advantage of the family and friends fleeing so it may go unnoticed.<br />The author brings in mental illness in one of his protagonists and the prejudice that might bring.<br />This is never over played so that it takes away from the main plot line; instead it serves to highlight the main plot line.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the book is that the author did not show any real emotional growth in his main positive role players while<br />characters such as Wilhelm digress soon and to such a degree that I found him extremely distasteful.<br /> This is true for many other negative protagonists within this book.<br /><br />The amount of research this author had to do to bring this book to publication is mind blowing,<br />the lines of diaspora communities in a time that was notorious for corrupt officials and inaccurate record keeping is amazing.<br /><br />I have one more thing to mention about the very distasteful Wilhelm, in the beginning of the book we meet him as a young romantic,<br />well educated and well read young man.  The epitaph of the scholar armed to rationally stand against irrational prejudice.<br />He soon gets swayed by really ridiculous propaganda... which got me thinking.  If real evil flourish when good men stand by and do nothing,<br />does evil sprout from intellectuals that stand for no principles?<br />The irony of the title was not lost on me; it is one of those titles that will bring something different to each reader as they read along.<br />For me the irony was seated in the principle that luck when once is persecuted due to a birthright and nothing more, may not be luck at all.<br /><br />WaArwing,<br />the lines of diaspora communities in a time that was notorious for corrupt officials and inaccurate record keeping is amazing.<br /><br />I have one more thing to mention about the very distasteful Wilhelm, in the beginning of the book we meet him as a young romantic,<br />well educated and well read young man.

B002Q9MZF6|1.0|First DVD I received was defective.  Traded for another, same problem.  There must be a problem with the production of the disks. I notice I am not the only one to encounter this problem.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book has a little bit of everything needed for a great read...Spies, Cyberwarfare, Air to air combat, (for us old retired fighter pilots) and impossible predicaments for Pres. Jack Ryan to overcome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a fun and addicting game.  you always want more. Fun to try and get all of the udgrades.
B001B6EAOY|4.0|Well, quite taking a long time to ship, caused by my country (Indonesia) national post has a very poor management.<br /><br />They arrived without &#34;Photofast&#34; brand, it just generic, i haven't tried them yet, but they did come in well-packed condition, equipped with case for each adapter ( i ordered 5). Good job.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|great book and fast delivery . i would recommend this product for people to read. love to read his books :)
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book kept my interest after the first couple of chapters.  I enjoyed the characters and their story.  It is more geared towards a younger audience than me.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Saw the film in the theatre, but loved it on the small as well. Would recommend it to all my friends.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I was tempted to buy the first book because of the media hype, then forced to buy this book because of the way the first book ended.  I wasn't disappointed by the characters or the sexual tension, but I will not be buying the third book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Beautiful graphic, wonderful design. Very good game for any age. This world tour is the best idea as you will not get bore with the same background.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was entertaining. A quick read and engrossing.  I have nothing negative to say about it, I enjoyed it well enough. I do not however have the adoring, can't live without reading it reviews that most other reviewers had. It was enjoyable an I will definitely be reading the next book in the trilogy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|found these books easy to read but still engrossing.  First book was a &#34;new&#34; thing.  Second was more predictable but liked the wheel idea in the games portion.
B004K58GSO|5.0|This story, although nearly duplicated in the film RIO BRAVO, is the Duke at his best, with the addition of a fine performance by Robert Mitchum and also one by a young James Caan.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Did not enjoy as much as first two books.  Still well written for it's genre but too much of District 13 for my taste.  I'm not a &#34;young&#34; reader so it probably colors my review a little.
B002RMVAZ8|4.0|I'm not sure but I think that this is an unexpurgated treatment of HAMLET and as such it's just too long for a movie treatment . . . it took me several sittings to finish it and I love Shakespeare . . . some editing would have tightened the story and made it just as complete.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|The only thing that could make this app better is if it made it an option to add it as a link to my Pandora :)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|in a panic I downloaded this because my son wouldn't stop crying and go to sleep. within seconds he was calm and within about 5 minutes he was asleep.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|this was like watching saturday morning cartoons...or maybe I'm missing something, I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler so maybe that was the problem, concept was ok but it could have been better
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|it is fun and all but i think u should at least have more time i meen i found dimand than my time ran out. FIX THE APP!
B001SKB1Y0|3.0|In true Woody Allen fashion this movie was slow, the scenary beautiful the story ...little confusing, at times I wanted to punch the boyfriend of Vicky, but I guess he was just doing his job....the movie was slow and at times I thought the actors were going to sleep, but thats how Woody Allen directs his movie...slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
B008M0NDOK|2.0|I won't lie I dropped it. not hard at all but I did drop i. s*** happens. We all drop things and it's not done on purpose so you can't tell me not to do it because it wasn't on purpose. however after a short drop the right trigger broke. I figured I could open it up and fix it but upon opening it i found out the button that broke basically can't be fixed. I don't even think you can get a replacement part. I'd have to solder it onto the board. For the price this should have taken a short fall and a long fall. Other then the crappy construction the controller is more uncomfortable then the original nes controller which i have many of. It looks a lot like a huge tg16 controller with analog sticks. It worked ok for the games. I even had a good time using it on my tv with airplay. Except for asphalt 7 which plays like crap but that's not the controller.  It doesn't help that a $40. controller has barely any games you can play with it. It seems like something a company would hand out for free to promote the purchase of there games. I will be getting another one with trade in credit from gamestop. They sell amazon cards. other then that don't reach for your hard earned money for this cheap brick. I had more fun playing the games even though I was only able to use it for a couple days. Maybe I'll get 2 just in case. i have a lot of trade in credit and nothing to do with it. Lol.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Like all russian novels it's hard to keep track of  names.  all in all this was an easy read as the action was kept flowing.
B009ZQ7M1U|4.0|The acting was good. Adrien Brody was good. It touched upon familiar territories for a &#34;school flick&#34;. It was engrossing at times.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I had alot of fun playing it, but ran out of levels too soon. The game says update coming soon.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I have a great time working with the differnt puzzles and you can make them as easy as you like are as hard.  Trust me its worth the fun to just challenge your mind when you feel like it.
B00006690G|1.0|Please do not give your money to an artist who advocates extreme violence to women and gay people. This talentless convicted felon, druggie and street thug should not receive societal approval.

B00632HWOG|5.0|Only problems is if anyone sends you a vidio it does not play flash on the kindle hd.  So any way if you are on the road a great product to keep you up to date.
B005LAII3A|1.0|I GUESS YOU GET WHERE I'M GOING WITH JUST THE TITLE! ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOLLYWOOD'S LACK OF IMAGINATION. SO SOME MORON DECIDES TO TAKE A STORY FROM 15 YEARS AGO, RE-TELL IT WITH MORE EXPLOSIONS, AND SUPPOSEDLY MAKE IT BETTER? ALL THEY DID WAS KILL THE ORIGINAL STORY AND CHARACTERS.......I ACTUALLY LOVE THE ORIGINAL AND DON'T JUDGE MOVIES BY IDIOT REVIEWERS AND BOX OFFICE RETURNS!<br /><br />THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MIND SCREW STORIES IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM SO ADDING TO IT JUST SCREWS IT UP...WHICH THE WRITERS DID WELL HERE! THERE AREN'T MANY REMAKES I ENJOY. PUNISHER WAS ONE OF THE FEW. THOMAS CANE DID A GOOD JOB BUT MUST HAVE GROWN HARD UP FOR WORK WITH THAT SILLY HBO SHOW \\"HUNG\\". DOLPH WAS GREAT IN THE FIRST. STORY PREMISE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. THE 2 HULK MOVIES WERE BOTH SUBPAR BUT THE SECOND WITH ED NORTON WAS WORSE IMO. I GUESS HE WAS SUCH A PUTZ THEY WENT WITH SOMEONE ELSE IN AVENGERS....WHICH KILLED THE HULK IN IT FOR ME.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE IF YOU LIKED ARNOLD AND THE ORIGINAL TOTAL RECALL THIS ONE WILL JUST BE A CONFUSING HEADACHE WITH EXPLOSIONS. TERMINATOR SALVATION MIGHT'VE BEEN A VIABLE MOVIE IF NOT FOR THE LACK OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, STORY DEVELOPMENT AND SOME INVOLVEMENT FROM THE ORIGINAL JAMES CAMERON/MARIO KASSAR.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's convenient to have ready for some calculating you need to do.  Easy to use. Ready to use and accurate.
B001VLBDD0|1.0|I ALREADY OWNED T2 ON DVD BUT DOWNLOADED A VERSION THAT HAD QUITE A FEW EXTRA SCENES AND THE ALTERNATE ENDING WITH A GROWN JOHN CONNOR PLAYING WITH HIS KIDS IN A PARK AND AN AGED SARAH, BLAU, BLAU, BLAU...YOU KNOW THE ENDING THAT RAN 154-158 MINUTES. I DON'T OWN BLURAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BS BUT UNDERSTOOD THE STANDARD EXTREME EDITION HAD THIS VERSION ALONG WITH 2 OTHERS (PERSONALLY DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE LONGEST UNCUT VERSION WITH THE ALT. ENDING). SAW ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT ENTERING A 5 DIGIT CODE BUT NOTHING BROUGHT IT UP SO I JUST WASTED MONEY FOR A SEMI-LONGER VERSION NOT THE FULL LONGEST VERSION W/ALT. ENDING...BEWARE!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Keeps me busy when I am waiting in a waiting room, bored and nothing to do.  Easier then carrying a deck of card around with you.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book made my admiration for Abraham Lincoln increase by leaps and bounds.  It portrays Lincoln as a great politician and leader, but also as a man of incredible kindness, magnanimity and generosity.  His honesty not only to others, but to himself is portrayed as one of the qualities that made him respected and admired even by his opponents and rivals.  Besides the focus on Abraham Lincoln himself, the book gives great insights into the character and lives of the cabinet members of the Lincoln administration of 1860 through 1865.  There was plenty of greatness in that &#34;team of rivals&#34; who under the direction and leadership of A. Lincoln carry the Union through one its darkest hours.  Wonderful perspective which to me was not only interesting, but also inspiring.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes Abraham  Lincoln, or anyone who would like to learn more about the lives of great men of honor, integrity, and patriotism.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is amazing but I don't like that u actually have to buy stuff. But the good thing is u can breed most of the dragons if u know how to! I also don't like the waiting part. I give this game 4 stars.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love everything Grisham does and this one does not disappoint.  Can hardly wait for his next book.<br />I would recomment it to anyone who loves stories about the law.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is in first grade and she loves  playing this game :) she understands how to play it by herself.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game. didn't want to put it down. I'll be waiting for the next release. good combination of object find, logic and memory.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is pure perfection it's the only book I read in 2 years it's inspirational. Words can't describe how amazing this book is <3
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|if you're 10 years old and like watching old cars explode, you'll love the movie.  it is silly and banal.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game it gets more and more challenging as you go Demands.eye ,hands and mind coordination.Even my granddaughters love it
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I enjoyed &#34;Flight&#34;.  Denzel is, pure usual, very good in the role of the captain.  Kind of predictable ending.  Overall, though, a good movie.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Recommended to me by my daughter-in-law .First time iI read her book suspense till the very end.Also like the idea it was stage in N.H. Made it more real to me.It had all you want in a book drama suspense sad, reality. I differently want to read more of her books
0316056898|5.0|\\"If you want to see a great pilot, watch the first episode of Cheers.\\"<br /><br />Tina Fey is a perfect mixture of qualities that make her a superb humorist. She is sharp, witty, profound, self-deprecating, humble, and genuine. Bossypants is her autobiographical journey where we discover the absurdities and oddities that created Tina Fey and her unique sense of humor. From the suburbs of Philadelphia to improvs of Chicago to the world Saturday Night Live, Tina brings a simple attitude about life that makes her relatable and funny.<br /><br />When you look closely at the world around you, soon you realize that life that you consider \\"normal\\" is actually ridiculous and irrational. Tina Fey is the best at showing us the preposterousness of the mundane.<br /><br />Any fan of Tina Fey, any fan of 30 Rock, or any fan of SNL over the past twenty years will love this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love this game.  It is a challenge and fun to play.  At first I wasn't sure I could do it but I did and now I am hooked
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|entertaining. good cliff hangers. beautiful costuming. Great way to spend a week with the flu.<br />worth the purchase, dump TV and cable subscriptions!
B00003CXBH|5.0|Having visited the area, seen the mission ruins, and marvelled at the Igazu falls, this is a masterpiece.  Depicts the sad end of the Jesuit role in educating the native Indians in new skills and talents.
B001EN71CW|4.0|I bought this set for two reasons: to be able to finally see at work my (then new) Blu-ray player and because also loving this series, despite the passing of the years, there is not even a whisker of an Italian version, although at the time Firefly was broadcast on pay per view italian channels.<br /><br />For the rest, there is little to say, the events narrated in the series are well known, the quality of the product, as well, and I am grateful that - not being a native English speaker - can I obtain the subtitles that are, as always, of a high standard.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|What a great take on the classic fairy tale!  I can't wait for the next book.<br />Cinder is very smart and loyal and doesn't know just how special she is.  I was dissappointed in the prince in the end though.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I loved this movie. I gave this dvd to a friend as a Birthday present.<br />The acting was ove the top.
B00A1XIXO6|5.0|WOW.I Was really taken aback by how great this album is. It's a  perfect mix of \\"Against the grain\\",\\"Stranger than fiction\\",And \\"The Grey Race\\",with a little \\"Suffer\\" And \\"The Process of Belief\\" sprinkled on for good measure.It certainly seems that since Brett returned and Brooks joined the lineup in 2001,this band is unstoppable.\\"Process of belief\\",\\"The Empire Strikes First\\"And \\"New maps of hell\\" were outstanding,(\\"The Dissent of Man\\" Kicked Ass too,And gets way too much hate,So what if it sounded different?,It was still a damn good album,\\"Wrong way kids\\",\\"Only Rain\\" And \\"Avalon\\" are classics)\\"True North\\"is no exception.How many more great albums does this band have left?As a fan,I'll be more than happy to find out!Well worth your time,and money.Standout tracks:\\"True North\\",\\"Robin hood in reverse\\",\\"Past is Dead\\",\\"Dept. of false hope\\".God,I love this band.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Love this movie! it's about time someone wrote a good interesting movie, and being based on actual events, this movie is Great, I highly recommend it. Every good video library should have this movie in it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very intelligent and entertaining drama.<br />Didn't know it was made by J.J. Abrams until the 5th episode.?<br />I like it more now.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|I gave this 2 stars only because:<br />1- The resolution of every single movie on there is so annoying. I hate how I'm only using 2 quarters of my 47 inch tv because the picture is cut from top and bottom. Don't tell me it's the tv settings, please. The only thing that fills up the screen is the \\"zoom\\" mode and no comment on that.<br />2- The \\"amazon\\" app on my smart tv (vizio) is ridiculous and needs tons of work. One of the issues that you only see a few movies that you can click on. You have to go to \\"search\\" to find the movie that you want to watch, other than that you'd think that they have no movies to offer at all.<br />3- There is no \\"amazon instant video\\" app for my samsung phone nor my samsung tablet. So amazon decided to provide thousands of other devices with this app (because I looked it up and saw the huge list that doesn't have neither my phone nor tablet) but chose not include the samsung devices. You can only find the app on the play store but it's \\"not compatible with your device\\" which made me really mad. Other than that, the picture is crystal clear and a million times better than netflix.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A lot of surprises in this book. I loved it actually. I kind of wish it could have ended different but I like the ending...I guess its actually the best she could do with the given facts. I don't want to give it away but if you've already read book 1 and 2...I don't understand why you haven't started this one yet. So just do it!
B008476HBM|5.0|My only regret in reading this piece is my decision to delay it so long in life. The language is lively, the attention it commands is constant, and the parallels that can be drawn across time hold true.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. I feel that there was a lot to cover in the last 1/2 of the book and it went sort of fast...but thats fine with me. A must read after book one for sure.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I think it is a very good concept and very useful.  The only problem I have had with it is that there is sometimes a problem when it syncs across all various devices.  Some of the information doesn't sync and it shows that there was an error.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone told me to read the books but I sort of watched the movie first. All I can say is I'm glad I started reading the books. The book gives so much more detail and helps you understand some of the things in the movie. If you're having hunger games withdrawl and can't wait until the next movie I say start reading the trilogy. Although it might make you that much more anxious for the next movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I couldn't put it down. Very well written it kept my attention from the first to last page and could hardly wait to start the next book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I hated for this series to end! Sad day! I have a new hero, in the form of Katniss.<br />Great writing and drama.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book and its very interesting. The second best out of the trilogy following the hunger games and ending with catching fire.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was an exceptional book with unforeseen twists and turns and was very hard to put down.  It provides a robust story line and likeable characters with whit and humor.  I recommend this book and agree with previous comments that this would make a great movie.  This does contain much more foul language than is needed to convey the story, but that would be my only complaint.  ~MW
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its fun but it can be a bit borning but if u like horse this is the game for u.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Lots of fun. I like how the rooms have the same items each time but get more difficulf to find. Still learning the game. Only wish I could obtain more energy. Challenging .
B00846F1YW|1.0|I got through the second task and got a trophy.  Now the game wants me to click on a Facebook or Twitter button to share my trophy.  Clicking either button tries to load another app with new permissions.  If I don't load the new apps, I can't continue the game.  This is not a game - it's a front-end for other apps they want to load.  That's dishonest.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|D.W. at his best ... Though I think twice about flying now . But the movie, to me, was genuine and gave a perspective of a pilot.
1449410243|5.0|I got this for my friend that just got a cat for a pet and she absolutely loves this book!! Funny stuff!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Very well done, loved it! The movie walks you through some of the best music ever recorded and it's amazing how much of it was created right inside of Sound City. The bonus scenes are excellent behind the scenes recording!
B009GEYX5E|5.0|This was a great deal and worked like a charm!! I got this in combination with an old polaroid camera and it worked GREAT!!!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Whenever Joe Walsh goes into the studio and releases a new body of works you can count on me to be on board.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Kronos has risen and Percy's world is no longer safe. Monsters roam the USA and have joined the forces of Kronos. Percy's camp is nolonger safe. It is only a few days till Percy's 16th birthday when the prophecy will be fulfilled. And worse, the gods are busy battling a giant monster called Typhon and are trying to keep it from reaching New York. This gives Kronos a clear path with his giant army to attack and destroy Olympus with his giant army of monsters, demigods, and titans.<br /><br />In order to save Olympus, Percy bathes himself in the River Styx and becomes invincible, like Achilles. Then he and his friends from Camp Half-Bllod set out to save Olympus.<br /><br />They are joined in battle by the Hunters, Party Ponies, giant automatons, Hades, Hades's army of the dead, and eventually the gods themselves in the ultimate battle more Olympus. In the end, Kronos and Percy face each other in the final battle. Read this book to find out the ending.
B00005U8P3|5.0|An intense recreation of a historic battle that made me feel like I was there and in the battle. One of the two best \\"war movies\\" I've ever seen.
B009G3T01M|5.0|I have to say that Macklemore is a gifted lyricist that shows true depth and honesty.  I am not a fan of rap music, but this album is full of clever, very musical hooks.  What can I say?  Amazing and creative lyrics + superior musical hooks = One five star album.
B0043UB0EI|1.0|I will NEVER order instant video again until you can guarantee with a refund that it will play on my computer, which plays dvd's, other online streaming media, hulu, etc. without being choppy, hesitant, etc.  I did not even get through the first ten minutes. It's ridiculous!!! I pay annual prime membership fees PLUS having to pay again for the video (hot even HD), and have to put up with the p**s poor playback!
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I expected a romantic comedy.  There were few funny parts, mostly awkward.  It was slow moving and not at all uplifiting, mostly depressing.  I wasn't drawn in by the characters.  Maybe it was not for my generation (I'm 40ish)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its a great game I loved it but now it just won't let me play anymore it sends me to the kindle home page I hope they fix the bug.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|I have pruchased this album as a gift to my girlfriend but in the end ended p buying another for myself. I honestly say i love it and thonk they are one of the best groups out there. While they may have a more hip hop felling to it than previous albums, they keep in touch with rock and their classic feel. Love it Recommend to anyone and everyone
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|This movie is good imaginative romp: The premise is that this doped up pilot flew a commercial jet liner upside down because the tail rudders were stuck in decent putting the plain in a steep dive. This allowed him and many other to survive.  Having worked on military aircraft, you have to have two fuel pumping systems on a plane for inverted flight, one would kick in when inverted flight is detected. Next, the airframe on any large jet would NEVER allow inverted flight, the wings would just snap off. But I got beyond that and continued to watch the movie. My mistake, I should have ended it then, I had seen the best parts.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was well written and a page turner! I couldn't put it down! Don't spoil it for yourself and read anything ahead of time! Best read of 2012!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun game I can play it for hours.  I like the rio one better than the original because of the great music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was as good as season one. I won't give spoilers but be sure not to miss this third season.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run has inmproved soooooooooooooooooooo much.  I'm so happy.  I don't have it on my kindle but I have it on my moms I pad.  its harder on a bigger screen though.  but I don't care.  its like in 3d.  its soooooooooooooooooooo cool!  u could say its fangtastic!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I love the Rebus series, and was so disappointed when Rankin ended it. This is a good plot, good characterization although Siobhan was a bit flat. The book is worth reading.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Great acting, excellent story, awesome soundtrack. Not your typical, Hollywood, fairy-tale ending. Interesting characters, a good examination of character, human nature, and the inherent goodness of mankind.
B002RI9K5Y|3.0|Unfortunately not my style. Sometimes a bit boring with descriptions or philosophies. Maye i missed the deer meaning of the novel
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I believe it started a bit slow but then it took off! A great book! Be prepared a long book but worth it!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have used Adobe Reader for several years. Never have had a problem using this product. I found it safe to use.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|A workable premise devolves into a silly and unnecessarily vulgar exercise. The singing is good, the choreography is wonderful ... but every other scene is drenched with irrelevant sexual references, crotch grabbing, lesbian speculation and blouse-ripping. Then there's the scene of a girl rolling around in vomit. It wouldn't be so off-putting except that the basic idea behind the movie has merit; clearly the producers felt it to be too wholesome and were hoping to dumb it down and sex it up for the older teen audience. The results is a disappointing, not-that-funny mish-mash with too few scenes of singing and too many missed opportunities for clever comedy.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|this was a pretty good movie, i would definitely watch it again. good story line and good cast. worth watchin again and again.
B008966SLM|5.0|If you like blues, or have heard Robert Cray before, you will like this CD.<br />Really like his music, great blues.
0071762345|5.0|For someone that feels a basic disconnect with social media, this is a great primer.  Easy to follow and implement.  Loved it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 4 yr old granddaughter got me hooked on this game, she is much better at it than I am.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|If you liked Rocky, the Fighter, Braveheart, Shawshank, Miracle, you will love this on multiple levels. A drama with family redemption, alcoholism active and in remission, and twists that lead to one of the most intense dramas and in my opinion the intense MMA is just a huge side benefit. Those seems are incredible. The movie starts out knowing that some of its plot lines are cliche, but blows away the expectation with deeply developed characters. Joel Edergton - Zero Dark Thirty; Tom Hardy - The Dark Knight, Inception (you won't even recognize him, this guy has serious range as an actor,) Nick Nolte (won a number of awards for his supporting role,) Jennifer Morrison (the even hotter Doc from House,) and others. One of those movies that you will hold back a tears for for more then one reason. A MUST see.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really wanted to read this book before seeing the movie (the 2011 US version starring Rooney Mara), but I never got around to it. I'm glad I still made the choice to read the book though!<br /><br />I thought it was going to be really hard to follow, with all of the various characters from the Vanger family, but Stieg Larsson wrote in such a way that everyone was actually quite easy to keep track of. There are quite a few little differences between the book and the movie, but nothing that made things confusing.<br /><br />The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the extensive introduction into Blomkvist's background. It went into quite a bit of detail about the financial occurences that he had researched about Wennerstrom that led to his being convicted of libel. I'm not the most well-versed in that area, so it was a little difficult for me to get into it.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good investigation with many twists and turns! A long read, but well worth it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun fun fun fun passes time well.Fun for all ages boys and girls men and women get it u will luv it . Me and my family do.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|Finally out on Blu-ray, the Doctor Who Complete Specials are the final special episodes of David Tennant's run as The Doctor.  The first three specials - The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, and the Waters of Mars - prepare the stage for the Tenth's finale in The End of Time.  Each special has somewhat of it's own theme; the inevitability of death and regeneration (The Next Doctor); the Doctor's relationship with companions and the effect that it has on them when they leave (Planet of the Dead); what the Doctor is capable of when left on his own, without a companion to temper the fury of a Time Lord.  They are themes that have played throughout the series, especially the need of the Doctor to have a companion and what he might do without one.<br /><br />The finale - The End of Time - brings the Doctor face to face with an old adversary, with an even greater threat coming.  It pushes him to his absolute limits, and forces the Doctor to face his own death as a man with nothing to lose.  The climax of the film is gripping, and the ending poignant as the Doctor says his final goodbye.<br /><br />Each of the specials has its own disc, and the set is loaded with extras, including audio commentary, deleted scenes, the Doctor Who Confidentials, etc.<br /><br />If you don't own any of the David Tennant specials, then this is the perfect set.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|you can never win coins to continue playing game freezes then takes the few coins it gives you. its a shame, seemed like it could have been fun.  not worth the space it takes on device.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good quality Picture good I enjoy this game very much I play it all the time it is so much fun
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I started watching AHS late in the first season and had to play catch up. It completely blew my mind and I thought for sure there's no way they can top season one. Boy was I wrong! Season two is as equally jaw dropping, creepy, weird and awesome as the first season! Completely different story line but the acting is spot on! I love this show and can not wait to see what they come up with for season 3!!
B00632HWOG|3.0|I didn't expect to compose email on the Kindle Fire.  It just takes too long to type.  I can do much better on a standard keyboard.  But, I wanted to be able to check email and the Yahoo app does that without a lot of fanfare.  There is a glitch that I've noticed.  When I'm streaming a video, if mail arrives the &#34;ping&#34; of Yahoo lowers the volume on the video.  I have to pause and restart the video in order to restore the volume.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i really love this game its very fun to play n very addictive i playd it one time and every since then i been in love wit it. Its better than Temple Run bt i enjoy them equally
B008WCP2KG|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie. The previews should such promise.  But, alas, it's a disappointment.  Channing Tatum's dancing was not used to full advantage.  Alex Pettyfer's looks were played down.  And Matthew McConaughey was just plain scary.  Everything could have been so much better.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Collins continues to keep the pace rolling along and this is a good follow up to the first novel. Some interesting characters are introduced to keep things fresh too.
B0086700CM|5.0|As many have said, an addictive game.  As any good game does, it provides more challenges the further along you get.  With Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tilting the Kindle helps with the movement, but can be difficult to get 'hold of.  It takes some practice.  Use the coins you earn in the game to get the upgrades.  They'll improve your enjoyment of the game.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|After the hype and the target demographic, as a virile 40 something male I didn't hold a lot of hope out for this. Curiosity won over and I'm rather glad it did. Well paced and interesting take on the future of the human condition. I didn't feel much in the way of sympathy for the lead, but I doubt she'd thank me if I did so it all just seems to work.<br /><br />Certainly makes the trilogy worth exploration.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|No words can adequately describe the intensity of this book. I couldn't put the book down because I had to know what was going to happen next. Jodi Picoult has impressed me yet again.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|A surprisingly readable trilogy and a solid enough read to close the series. Without spoiling much, this just seemed to fizzle out though. Not quite satisfying enough.
B001FVD65O|3.0|The movie itself is perfectly ridiculous fun; you get what you expect. But the stream of the video was quite poor (we have high-speed AT&T U-verse with all bars a-blazing) and the stream stopped dead in its tracks twice.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I didn't think I would care for it, but I was hooked after the first episode. Not to be missed.
B0059DQHHI|5.0|I found this movie was great for forcing a little reflection on what is the correct way to deal with life's biggest issues. Great story, acting and production. Nice to travel a bit on the sofa also. I am careful to not not give away too much.
B000000OTU|5.0|I found this album at Strawberries, and what a find it was! It's a nice mix of some of their songs from the last three albums, but it kicks off with a ROCKIN' tune called \\"Walk On Water\\" which lets Steven make that harmonica sing and does their whole blues infused vibe justice.  Also on the album is another great song called \\"Deuces Are Wild'. Long story short: It's a nice mix of both '80's and '90's songs, so if you like a little bit of both, you won't go wrong with this album.
078322737X|5.0|if you like old cars, great music and awesome acting you really need to buy this movie. Its funny and just all around awesome!
B00005QENZ|5.0|This was the second album of theirs that I bought, and yes, I did play my first copy of it to pieces. (Also the cover is fake for all you animal lovers out there - they didn't really pierce a cow's udder, but my sister did think the picture was hilarious.)  I was familiar with at least one track on the album (\\"Cryin'\\", on which Steven does an AMAZING harmonica solo), so the rest was new to me when I listened to it all the way through. One of their most inspirational songs is \\"Amazing\\", on which Steven sings about how hard it was for him to get sober. If there is one line from this album I love, it's this one: \\"Life's a journey, not a destination.\\" Yeah, Steven can be really deep with some of his lyrics. Other than that, this is a wicked good album, and proof that Aerosmith was indeed ready for the '90's. No one can deny them that. Do I love this album? HECK YEAH!! This is a must have for any Aerosmith fan, hands down. You NEED this albun for your collection. 'Nuff said!
B00008G7UF|5.0|this movie is one of my favorites! its just so good, great dialog and acting. i LOVE Kevin Kline in this film.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|best game I have played taking care of a horse is fun if I get a real horse this game would help me
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game I am 49 years old and I love this game. It was hard at first but when you get the the first place you get faster and feel great you get happy and you can spend a lot of time before you realize how long you have been playing I give it 10 stars
