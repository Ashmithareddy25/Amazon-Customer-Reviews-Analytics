0307950654|5.0|I really loved her  originality in rewriting this classic.  I didn't know what to expect and was really engrossed in it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|you will not want to stop reading... a different kind of story! I dont think i spotted any bad editing, typos, or spelling errors.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome.....its a must buy...this game is not slow and doesnt have glitches like other apps do. this game also goes on tours so that you see what other places would look like. its fun and easy. i prefer subway surfer than temple run... buy the game and see for your self
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the second time  i have read this book and i could not take my head out of it! Amazing!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is amazing. Im twelve and love survival themed stories with lots of action and adventure. Life of Pi isnt like that but excedes my standards for a good book. It is about survival with adventure and suspense. His one is really different from other survival stories in a most awesome way. The ideas are so amazing. This is one of the top 3 books out of about a thousand ive ever read. get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever in my opinion you should really get because it has a lot features that fun like different characters and they take world tours to places
B00069FLC2|5.0|And did I mention awesome.  No one does it better than The Shadows.  They were Britain's 1st rock 'n' roll band and set the pattern for all who followed.  Most all of Britain's &#34;guitar gods&#34; list Hank as their idol and this video leaves no one to wonder why.  He is brilliant (so are Bruce and Brian).  These guys make flawless look easy.  The music rocks and the friendly banter sets the mood for a wonderful evenings entertainment.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Ich finde die App sehr gut , tut was sie muss. Da die Akkulaufzeit aus der üblichen Anzeige nicht hervorgeht, macht diese App echt Sinn
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love the game and also have a farm game. I like the simpleness of it. Don't like the pop ups and also the inability to correct a mistake. I don't like the marketing angle in forcing the use of gems to complete a table and chair set. However there is enough variety to mix and match fairly easy. I have a kindle so it is frustrating to get the new stuff last. I also don't social network so I miss out on. that sharing aspect too.  fun game that requires a very little monetary or time investment .
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This series grabs you from the beginning. The back story keeps you hooked while each episode has you entertained. Great spin on a traditional story.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam Harris explains free will elegantly and promptly. Never before have I read an informative (and persuasive) essay which so quickly and easily addresses its point.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to broaden their ideas and opinions of free will.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|SINISTER is an eerie, atmospheric and original reworking of the found footage plotting.  Director Scott Derrickson, who gave us the excellent EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE, crafts the tale of an egocentric novelist looking to match the success of his first best seller by chronicling the disappearance of a young girl whose remaining family was brutally murdered.  He locates a set of very disturbing videotapes that propel him into a terrifying mystery.<br />Ethan Hawke is superb as novelist Ellison Oswalt, giving an earnest portrayal of a man embroiled in a frightening scenario.  Juliet Raylans is less impressive as his loyal, but frustrated wife.  Law & Order alum Vincent D'Onofrio and Fred Dalton Thomas have very brief but effective cameos.  The music is often effectively chilling and suitably irritating which adds to the edginess of the film.<br />SINISTER isn't an \\"enjoyable\\" film per se but it's definitely a good horror film.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I loved it.  It was very intriguing and interesting.  I am a 007 fiend.  Also, I am a diehard fan of Daniel Craig, he is such a good actor.
076790592X|5.0|This was a great book. It was a heartbreaking story, but will forever change the way I look at life.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|Downton Abbey the most magnetic program on television! Grateful that PBS is making it all posssible.As shocking an ending ever,Matthew was so happy, just full of bliss.After the horror and tears and only being able to vision the impact to follow, I have managed to compose myself and WAIT.The entire house will be topsy turvey.\\"If\\" this is truly to be Matthews end then who will fill the empty arms of Mary and Tom,they are surly not a match but the beautiful young lady from Scotland could be an interest for Tom.She is going to be broke but could mature to bring a match.Each character will be impacted,what will happen in London? What willhappen in the house downstairs? Can not wait for season 4,the intrigue is over whelming!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Not as funny as angry granny, but just as much fun! I love competing with my kids and facebook friends!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book I can't wait to continue into the third book! I recommend this book to anyone who loves a love story with a bit of a twist.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|A nice package of the introduction of the new series. I wish they had kept Christopher Eckelson on for another series. Price was right (wish the other new series were so reasonable) and delivery by Amazon, as always, was good.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It was hard to move and stuff. It sucked. U should eaither change it or delete it. Its that terrible

B00881VLCE|4.0|while I am enjoying these puzzles,  I wish the pieces on the side had a little more contrast to the background,  so they were easier to see
B0082GQ5HG|1.0|All the best parts are shown in the trailer, and then you have to sit through 87 additional minutes of boredom.  This film isn't just bad, it is REALLY REALLY TERRIBLE.
B00AJLHUYO|2.0|'Sinister' was a massive disappointment. I should have known better. \\"From the director of The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\", as though that's something to market on. I hated that movie, and thought it was a massive letdown. Anyway as has always been the case I read a ton of reviews that suggested even jaded horror fans will find it truly scary and terrifying, what a load of granny's apple pie that was. Truth is the movie was average horror at best, only a little creepy here and there, even sometimes predictable, which I did not expect.<br /><br />I suggest not even reading my review any further and go watch Insidious again. I can tell you that Insidious at least does manage to be truly creepy and scary at times. it can also almost get a jump out of a hardcore horror fan, but this movie doesn't even come close to being as good as Insidious, and I am truly a hardcore horror fan, and even Insidious was not as good as I had hoped. Still I did really like it though. But this movie? If you are a genuine jaded horror fan and not just one who really isn't but thinks they are, I feel pretty confident in saying you will likely sit there wondering when something is going to happen that will really knock your socks off. And while your waiting, if you saw the trailer, you'll be thinking \\"Ok maybe it get's really scary when he see's what ever it was I saw in the trailer that made him jump back in terror. I bet it get's really horrifying then\\". Well the truth is when that moment comes don't expect much if you truly are a real jaded horror fan because you will likely be disappointed that the moment is only a little unsettling and not much more than that.<br /><br />Added to that, What was supposed to be these ghost children or what ever they were, they looked like your average kids next door in bad Halloween makeup. This was supposed to really creep you out. But it doesn't. It comes off feeling pretty silly and sometimes mildly creepy. Mostly the inclusion of the children made it seem more like a lite weight horror film for lite weight horror fans. But there were some moments that gave me a bit of a jump and a few seconds here and there where I felt a bit scared I suppose, But that's it. And the acting was excellent sometimes, but also a bit off at other times. Including Hawke who I felt didn't react enough to some stuff that would make most people s*** their pants.<br /><br />The 8mm footage scenes were a bit creepy, but felt more like something you would see on one of those ION forensic TV shows, and the demon or what ever it was looked like a singer from a Norwegian black metal band. In the end there was maybe one or two mild jump scares, some pretty good music, and silly kids running around in bad Halloween makeup. Strongly advise hardcore horror fans to skip it. If you are the kind of person that thinks 'Drag me to Hell' or 'The Evil Dead' are truly disturbing scary movies, then this will really scare you. But if you think those movies are for kinder Horror fans and you want something that really will get under your skin please take my advice and skip this one. The hype is overblown by leaps and boundsore like a lite weight horror film for lite weight horror fans.

B0058DRTGC|5.0|The research is well documented, the principles that make organizations move from good to great are not only well explained but well lived through the product of this document. This kind of literature can really make a difference in the lives of organizations, their leaders, their workers and most importantly those who directly or indirectly benefit from the organizations outputs. Thank you Mr. Collins.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I purchased my Kindle Fire HD three months ago and got this case immediately afterward. Since then, I have taken the Kindle on 2 plane trips, 2 train excursions, numerous car rides, in backpacks & bags, anywhere and everywhere -- and this case has kept the Kindle completely protected. Not a scratch to be found.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Elastic band helps keep the cover closed and the Kindle protected<br />*Case is cushioned so it keeps the Kindle from getting banged around in a purse or backpack<br />*Tight plastic shell around the actual Kindle means the Kindle will not slip out of the case<br />*Case design allows the Kindle to be propped up, either vertically or horizontally, for movie-watching or other uses<br />*Openings in just the right places allow for the Kindle to be charged, headphones to be plugged in, and buttons to be accessed with ease<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Sometimes the elastic band gets caught behind the Kindle (between it and the back of the case) and I have to pry it out with my fingers<br />*The Kindle occasionally slips out of its standing position when propped up, though the worst it does is collapse on itself; no damages to report.<br />*Closing the case usually puts the Kindle into sleep mode, but NOT 100% of the time<br /><br />However, the pros far outweigh the cons. I LOVE this case. It does everything I need it to do, and thanks to it, my Kindle remains in wonderful condition to this day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting!  My son loves playing this game as well.  I played the android version on my phone, but I have beat all the puzzles.  I hope they add a new puzzle soon!
B008220DIC|5.0|Kidding aside, this is the finest movie I've seen in at least a decade. It's everything people say it is. Heart-breaking and uplifting, at least for me, a cult suvivor.  The performances by Phoenix & Hoffman phenomenal; supporting cast superb.  Score by Jonny Greenwood is perfecto.  Cinematography, art direction just stunning.  PT Anderson hit it out of the park into the next galaxy. If you were bored or didn't get it, too bad.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use it everyday on every platform. Awesome system for saving everything from research to ideas to pictures. Use it on my Fire, phone and laptop to organize everything.
B009DJB8I2|2.0|I think this was made by a high school kid with a synthesizer. it's just repetitive beeps.... except for a few tracks.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This is truly a classic movie.  I have already watched it and laughed and cried just like the first time.<br />The move arrived very quickly and in exactly the condition stated. I love adding to my movies this way!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game was an awesome game to play. I really like how they made it,the first one was ok but this one is awesome.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This came in the mail with days of ordering.  We saw this during the holidays and wanted to add it to our collection.  The visuals in this film are amazing. It is a perfect addition.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Entertaining and continues to expand the characters.  I'm looking forward to reading the 3rd book of the installment and eventually discover who will sit upon the throne and if there will be peace in the kingdom.  hahaha!
0765365278|5.0|After reading Sanderson's work with the Wheel of Time Series, I am now intrigued enough to want to read more from him. Way of Kings was better than I hoped it could be. Some may find this book to be on the long side, however, I found myself skillfully carried through the story and did not notice the length at all. I'll continue to follow this series and have just ordered the Mistborn trilogy, also written by Sanderson.
B003SQVI54|2.0|After catching up to Go On and liking it, we decided to check out Episodes 1 and 2 of Cougar Town, hoping we had missed another post-Friends success for the Friends cast.<br /><br />We hoped to see a bit more witty dialog to this, and after waiting years to first catch it, had expectations that it might be more watchable.<br /><br />But while the premise had promise, the reparte was lacking.  The editing was choppy, and the soundtrack sound effects got annoying after about 1&1/2 episodes.<br /><br />So this one is out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I so enjoyed this book - struggled to put it down. An easy read that had me hooked right the way through
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Don't bother watching it or wasting your time. It seems anything that Cage has been in within the last few years has been pretty horrible with a couple exceptions.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I play everyday. It is so simple. The more I play the more I love it. I highly recommend Misile Defender.
B00715SUI6|4.0|I know some people don't really care for movies such as these but I enjoyed it. It shows of what happened to the two sisters when they were younger and has an interesting story to it. I would say that you could watch this one before the other two as it is more of a prequel in a sense. I would recommend this to anybody who has seen the first two or to anybody has an interest in the genre.
1451695195|4.0|Check with me again in a week or two.  I will decide then if I really liked it or not.
1401232590|4.0|This limited series of Batman is pretty interesting. It shows the teaming up of Harvey, Jim, and Batman. Fairly interesting story to see what happens with a man who feels like he can't get anything done using the legal system. I would definitely recommend this story to anybody who has an interest in Batman.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book is funny weird and awesome at the same time I LOVED this book<br />This was such an awesome book.
1455527475|5.0|The book &#34;Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story&#34; is by Greg Smith, the same guy who wrote the New York Times editorial about the destructive corporate culture at Goldman Sachs.  Given the title, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book spent little space on why he left the company (only the last twenty pages or so); rather the book is an overview of Greg Smith's life at Goldman Sachs. He describes his move to America, his internship at Goldman Sachs, and then moving up in the company until he ultimately became a very successful equity manager making nearly one million dollars per year.  The book ends with his leaving the company, disgusted by the change in company culture during his time there.<br /><br />Greg Smith's writing is clear and interesting. He uses anecdotes to stay relatable and really spends time fleshing out the people in his life. The focus is on his time at Goldman Sachs (which took up most of his time while he worked there) but he occasionally mentions things from his personal life which help in understanding the reasons for his later leaving the company.<br /><br />The book is short and a quick read.and anyone who is interested in what working at a large financial firm on Wall Street is like should enjoy it.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal minds has always been a winner in my book, and season 8 is shaping up to be the same way. While violent, it's smart and the character development is interesting while not detracting from the crime of the week.

B00002MZ4V|5.0|This is the music of John William as we recall form the movies .ride into battle with Luke or march with Darth Vader it is all here to hear
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie absolutely took my breath away. It was visually stunning, historically accurate to the extent that my husband repeatedly nudged me regarding a lot of very minute details, and was superbly acted. Did I forget to mention that the screen play which was based upon Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team Of Rivals took a huge amount of information and meaningfully compressed themes to tell an important story about the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and the abolition of slavery. This movie made me proud to be a born and raised Illinoisian and explains Lincoln reputation as a history significant president and a self-educated and brilliant man.<br />Without summarizing this expansive movie in detail, I'm going to tell you why I just saw this movie at the theater for the second time and why I am buying a DVD of this film. There is too much in this movie to absorb in just one viewing. I don't mean this as a negative, but there were so many characters, so many opinions and sentiments expressed that I wondered if I got it all the first time around. Turns out I really missed nothing except the opportunity to fully appreciate the wonderful performances that were peppered with slight nuances that transformed the actors from acting to really becoming the characters. In a film populated with a huge cast of superb performers, this movie transported me to a different reality of nearly 150 years ago. I was sitting on the edge of my seat during this movie.<br />Hearing Daniel Day Lewis speak made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. His demeanor, his gait, his gesturing, and his speech patterns and intonations all made me feel that I was seeing the real Lincoln. I don't think anyone would dispute Lewis' reputation as a versatile performer, but this role really was really difficult as far as I am concerned. Lewis' clearly must have done a huge amount of research on Lincoln to play a historical figure that is legendary but who we never heard.<br />Sally Field had the southern gentility and nervous demeanor I would have expected and looked quite a bit like Mary Todd Lincoln without resorting to obvious trickery. Field's portrayal managed to give depth  to a historical figure that has often been written off as a crazy lady. Brilliant casting despite the criticisms that Sally Field was too old to portray Mary.<br />Tommy Lee Jones was amazing down to the limp dragging leg and ill-fitting wig as Thaddeus Stevens. While beefier looking than the real Stevens, he portrayed Stevens as quick witted, clever and king of one-liners he was reputed to be. There was a nice offset between Lincoln and Stevens who were fundamentally very different people in terms of demeanor as well as motives. In fact, Jones' Stevens did a formidable job of crankily eating up all of his opponents and spitting them out. Leaves me in a state of wonder as to just how good an actor Jones is and how often it seems he is undervalued as an actor.<br />From the acting, to the sets, costuming, make-up, and visuals this movie is incredible.<br />I sat on the edge of my seat both times I saw this movie. I didn't make any rushes to the concession stand or rest room despite its rather long running time.<br />I know that recommending a DVD of this movie that I have yet to see is jumping the gun and probably not the best reason to recommend it. However, a  DVD with pause capability, a comfortable couch, food and toilet facilities, and a big flat screen sound good for my third time around.y and nervous demeanor I would have expected and looked quite a bit like Mary Todd Lincoln without resorting to obvious trickery.

B007712XAU|5.0|needed to catch up to series 3. could not stop watching once we got started. great show. recommend for all
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I look forward to every show.  Seeing Watson catch the few thing that Holmes misses is really fascinating to watch.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse is amazing, don't get me wrong on that. BUT! I would love to see if the software  could make it that the anker light would flip between colors (like the rainbow), instead of just the pulsing. Thanks anker!!!
B009OYSFDM|3.0|I like this show but it is few and far between with the unexpected plot twists.  Some of the plot lines are being stretched out to long and others receive too little attention.  Biggles is a great character but  receives almost no time on the screen.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I'm not a twilight tween or teen...but I know a delicious looking man when I see one and Ian has got to be the most beautiful man on Tv...ok Jay Ryan a close 2nd.  Matter of fact I probably am too old for the age demographic of the CW...but this show is so addictive.  I always knew that I'd love the show if I started watching it, but for some reason just didn't get to the CW often.  Over the years I'd catch an episode and think...who is this Ian Somerwhatshisface :)Read the 50 Shades books and kept seeing his name associated with the C. Grey character (and now I'm totally On THAT bandwagon--he IS Mr. Grey)...so in one weekend I was in this VD trance...watched one episode after another and now in Season Two.....and I am positive I will not finish unitl I am caught up before Season 4 ends.  But I have to be honest, knowing that Ian and Nina are a real couple off screen has been fun to watch on screen...keeps you wondering...so this chemistry you see on the show is really going on behind the scenes.  Their chemistry is amazing and he is just one of those actors you can't take your eyes off not merely because of his beauty...and he is quite breath-takingly beautiful....but his acting of this character is priceless.  He really plays the cocky vamp better than any I've seen...the man has such amazing range. As do many of the other actors.  Just a great combo of writing and acting.  BRAVO!  Hope this show has many more seasons!!
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|This product started coming apart before a week  of use .I tried to contact the company only to be told that I would have to ship it back at my expense. The company also said they would consider refunding after they inspected the cover but said that it was not a given. This cover was a huge disappointment as well as dealing with the company management for standing behind their product.

0756407125|4.0|Like NOTW, this is a continuation of Kvothe's story.  Unfortunately, there are a couple sections towards the end that are long and unneeded.  They don't necessarily detract from the story, but they'll waste a couple extra hours of your time burning through them.  Never-the-less a great book.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I love the combo pack! DVD for the car, Blu-ray for the livingroom and the Digital Copy for the iPad.

0385535147|5.0|Grisham says in his brief afterwords that he did practically no research, a first. I love it! Maybe lack of spending time in research freed up your mind to invent the most captivating plot of my very long life and a reading history of almost the full 71 years.<br /><br />A native, I love his stories set in Florida. Grisham flexes his muscles for us when he assumes the voice of a Black attorney. Came close. But the plot, the plot! Love it love it love it. Thank you John G! (Ariel I.)

B002WYH5N2|5.0|I've read the book and seen every adaptation and this is my favorite.  Departs from the book by concentrating the Darcy and Lizzie characters.  LOVED the director's commentary which revealed the details behind  the scenes, the visuals are stunning and the music wonderful--ALL original  Have watched it many times and never tire of it.  Matthew MacFadyen (who can  make a hagen dazz commercial an orgasmic experience with that voice) is a perfect Keira Knightley, who was just 19 at the time was the Lizzie I conjoured in my mind when I read the book as a young girl.  Enjoy it often -- and have your man watch it to understand what real passion and romance look like. NO offensive language or sex, just  YUMMY.

LOVE Nathan Fillion  (catch him on ABC's 'Castle') though and was intrigued by references to 'Firefly' series on 'Big Bang Theory' so had to check it out.  Am a big sci fi fan. Loved this series and hope Nathan and Josh get to bring it back.

142312166X|5.0|I'm completely obsessed over these books, and had to buy this, even though I finished the series a while ago. It looked too good to resist. Plus, I love the setup: a few short stories featuring Percy and crew, character bios and interviews, and some puzzles and games. It's a cute idea and I loved it.<br /><br />This is an especially quick read, as only a few of the pages are actually completely covered in text. It took me only a few days to breeze through it, but I'm sure most could finish in a few hours. I like to take my time.<br /><br />I was worried that this would just be an extra book that is the result of a cheap gimmick to squeeze more money from Percy Jackson fans. But everything stays true to the series, and I love the short stories especially. They're little snippets of character interaction that are not related to the overall plotline of the series but are still gripping reads.<br /><br />Rick Riordan is a fabulous author, and I just adore all of his books. The Demigod Files gets 5/5 stars. Recommened for any Percy Jackson fan.
B003L20IHO|5.0|I saw this several years ago and bought the movie.  Really good movie if you like heart-felt movies and I think it is well told.  The cost of the BR was worth it to me.  Good value!
B000H5TVJY|1.0|product crashes Blue ray player, I have yet to be able to get anything to recognize the Blue ray as a movie... my PS3 damn near exploded, and it took massive amounts of word just to get the disk to eject, and my Blue ray DvD player in my laptop refuses to see it as a playable disk and constantly asks me to reformat the disk..<br /><br />as much as I love the movie, the Blue ray disk is a disaster waiting to happen.
B0068FZ0J2|5.0|Blu-ray version is very good!! Always a good movie to have in the collection and while you might watch the movie in other settings, on a sufficiently large home screen BR is the way to go.

B004132HZS|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series. Started with season 2 and just had to go back and see season 1. The actors are wonderful.  Hope there's more to come and that Hollywood movies haven't taken them away from this series for long!
B007TK77QE|4.0|An enjoyable read.  Was interested to see what the author could come up with after Harry Potter.  There was an interesting collection of characters whose lives were entwined around a small village and the effect of tradition versus liberal thinking.<br />Could recommend this - easy read.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Well written and interesting plot twists, I would definitely recommend to the mystery - thriller lover, especially for the great amazon download price.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I now have the UK releases on vinyl, the first CD release and now this box set. And as with the previous 2, it is money well spent.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed the review that charts as most helpful/critical on Amazon. Since I am not an audiophile in the pure sense of the word, I will give a review from the fan perspective.<br /><br />When you look back at what were the top 100 songs in America in 1963 and see Sugar Shack by Jimmy Gilmer and The Fireballs at the top spot you wonder if the musical landscape could be any more barren. The majority of people in the U.S. had no idea what was about to hit them in late 1963 and early 1964. Wow!<br /><br />Listen to the  \\"Please, Please Me\\" disc and follow it up right away with \\"With The Beatles\\". Sprinkle in the songs from \\"Past Masters Vol.1\\" up through and including \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"This Boy\\". Still sounds fresh and energetic today. Imagine what it must have sounded like 50 years ago! Now match what you just listened to with what the big hits were in 1963 America.<br /><br />Each successive album in this set stands up well on it's own. From a fan perspective I can't see any weak links.<br /><br />This is just a very well put together box set. The mini-documentaries are a nice bonus. I have the stereo set. Saving up for the mono one next. And I'm quite sure that it will be just as fun to listen to!

142311339X|5.0|One of my daughter's favorite lines is \\"Dad, you got to the party late.\\" That's the way I feel about picking up \\"The Lost Hero.\\" I happened to be in my local Costco a few months ago and saw \\"The Mark of Athena\\" when it was first released. I was intrigued by the title because both of our daughters have Greek names (Athena Nicole and Persephone Alexis). At first glance, I didn't realize that \\"Mark\\" was Book Three in 'The Heroes of Olympus' series. I was forced to double back to the beginning, which brings me to this review. I'm enjoying the read but didn't know how popular the series is. I'm a high school English teacher and have been carrying the book around campus, reading whenever I get the chance. I've had so many students excitedly come up to me and ask how I like the book. One student was prepared to loan me his copy of Book Two (which I've already got a copy of). Rick Riordan has truly created a phenomenon among young adult readers. He has also captured the imagination of this middle-aged black man.

0545265355|5.0|I bought these books in the boxed set because I had a feeling they would be just that good, and I was right. The stories are addictive (though they don't seem like children's books), and I have breezed through them, at least compared to my normal reading speed. In college it can take me a long time to get through books, since I have lots of other things that require my attention, but with these books, i make time. The case for the books is very sturdy, and they look great on the bookshelf in my living room with the showier books (mostly hardcovers). The price was reasonable for 3 hardcover books, and the story is amazing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book keep on the edge of my seat, I couldn't put it down. When I did all I could think about, what would happen next. Must read.
B0014H32MG|5.0|Yes i know King originally wrote this under a psydoneum and that it's not much of a horror book but it was still a great King book and I highly recomend it.
B008LSVLZG|5.0|I really admire this musician since I've discovered a few years ago, listening first to Blackfield and Porcupine Tree. (Also: No-Man, Bass Communion, etc.)<br />In his solo career, has deepened his love of progressive rock, psychedelic and ambient music, and for me, is the heir to the golden age of 70s.<br />For fans of the genre, a piece that can not miss in your collection, really fantastic!!!!
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Could someone turn the lights on please.  Ethan walks around with a flash light in his own house, continually.  He would have been better served with a lighter to illuminate a movie that had terrible acting, terrible writing, and terrible directing.  I watch movies continually for years.  I can watch almost anything.  The only reason I continued to watch this movie was just to see how terrible it could continue to be.  Usually the Amazon star system for rating movies has been relatively accurate.  I think the director and executive producers have been rating this for a month to get the number of stars it got.  Trust me...Bad, really bad.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book!!! Couldn't put it down once I started...a must read. Looking forward to reading more from this author.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie knocked my socks off both visually and in story. Sure,it may be a little predictable, but the message is purely good, unlike the defiant boy chasing and desperation in the other princess movies, this centers on family and overcoming pride, in the age old struggle between mother and teen daughter. The graphics are to die for, and the music is pristine. My only warning be that it can get a little scary for very little kids. I would parent rate it at 5 yr+. My 3 year old son watches and loves it, but has to be reminded that it is just a movie.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|It is difficult to add to the many already existing reviews that praise this excellent series. I have enjoyed every chapter I've seen so far. It is absolutely high quality, the effort in the filming, the selection of the footage, all justify your investment in a resource that is both enriching and entertaining.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was such a good book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It was a nice get-a way book that I finished in 1 day. I laughed every time she got his name wrong and kept calling him Carter. Some of these scenes made me shiver because they were steamy. I absolutely loved that the book was in both her and his point of view because it helped me know exactly how they felt. Great read! Highly recommend!!!
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Led Zeppelin played a charity concert at the O2 Arena in London in 2007.  Jason Bonham played the drums.  Simply put, this is a monster of a live album.  Led Zeppelin sounds as good as they did in their heyday.  Jimmy Page plays the guitar like he has The Devil in him and Jason does his dad proud.  Robert Plant does a fine job but you can tell that he holds back a lot on the high notes and cheats where he can.  Hey, the guy is in his sixties and most singers cannot hit the high notes they did in their twenties.  John Paul Jones is as good as ever.  The album is chock full of classics and my favorite track on the entire album is &#34;Kashmir&#34;.  It is simply epic.  Fans of Led Zeppelin really need to buy this album.  If Led Zeppelin ever reunited for a world tour and played this good, then they would be the biggest band in the world again.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Let me start off by saying that these are two of my favorite writers and I adore the main character, Pendergast.  But after reading Cold Vengence I have started to question my admiration.  We all love characters who never die and barely get out alive, but Two Graves just pushes the limit way too far.  I have three big problems with this story<br /><br />1) Nazis.  Really, again?  It's the year 2013 and by now I am so sick and tired of all bad people coming from Germany or having German ties.  It's been so over done and it needs to stop now.  How is it that these gifted writers, the writers who gave us a hard look at homelessness, microwave guns and the secret to eternal life could possibly give us dedicated readers something as lame as Nazis.  Most of this plot was taken from the X-Files and The Island.<br /><br />2) The secondary characters became so secondary you could easily forget about them.  Mainly, Corrie Swanson.  After a rather griping and believeable abduction from the last book you barely see her in this book.  And it just doesn't make sense.  At all.  What happened to the spunky girl from Still Life with Crows?<br /><br />3) Constance.  It was pretty clear three books ago that this character was going to become interesting, but instead, she became so 2 dimensional that she may as well have stayed hidden in the walls.  Again, what happened to the wronged woman who climbed a volcano?<br /><br />The more I think about it, the more annoyed I become.  I waited a long time for this book to be released and hoped that it would yield something extraordinary and mind blowing since that's what these writers are know for, but instead it felt like I was reading a knock off James Bond story with even less believeable escape plans.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|I realize that I'm going to be in the minority when I say this, but DJANGO UNCHAINED is essentially two movies locked into one.  The first 75 minutes tell a highly entertaining tale of a quest, in which Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and the eponymous Django (Jamie Foxx) assume the role of bounty-hunters in search of Django's enslaved spouse Hilde (Kerry Washington).  The story is tightly constructed, with intertextual nods to 1960s spaghetti westerns, late John Ford - perhaps even a nod to Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES.  The interplay between the two protagonists is well sketched in, with Schultz gradually helping Django acquire self-confidence as well as discovering a unrivaled talent as a shooter.  There are some extremely funny lines delivered absolutely deadpan by the actors, with notable cameos from Don Johnson as a ruthless plantation owner.<br /><br />With Leonardo DiCaprio's entrance as Calvin Candie into the action, however, the film falls apart. The two protagonists find Hilde, and try to forge a deal with Candie for Hildy's release; however their plans are discovered.  The rest of the film tells an increasingly ludicrous tale as Django emerges triumphant in a series of bloodbaths.  The story becomes not only historically inaccurate, but it is actually demeans the characters it purports to support - i.e. the African-Americans.  Tarantino suggests that they have to assume the kind of superhuman traits associated with white comic-book characters, rather than develop identities of their own.<br /><br />DJANGO UNCHAINED is worth watching, if only for the two central performances.

B001SYX4RI|5.0|Some years ago, before John Patrick Shanley's play \\"Doubt\\" was made into a movie, I read a magazine interview with him about this work. The sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church had broken a few years before, and Mr. Shanley remarked that at the same time much of this abuse must have been taking place, religious sisters were leaving their communities in droves. He pointed out that as many of the sisters were teachers in Catholic schools, they would have been in a position to be aware that something was wrong if a student were being abused, that in some cases they must have surely known about it. At the same time, their position was such that they had little recourse. He speculated that this may have been a driving factor behind many sisters' decision to leave the religious life. This speculation led him to write the script for \\"Doubt\\", a subtle, intricate, haunting movie about not just abuse, but about power -- the differences in power between adults and children, between blacks and whites, between teachers and students, between different members of a religious order, and between women religious and their male priests.<br /><br />Do I think the priest was guilty? Absolutely -- but ultimately we cannot know. The story plays out as a long, beautifully nuanced sketch of the characters of the two antagonists, though, showing how each one wields his or her particular type of power and shows his or her motivations.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is the sort of person easy for contemporary Americans to laugh at, the dragon lady principal of a Catholic school who strolls the nave at Mass searching for misbehaving students, smacking heads, grabbing ears, barking harsh reprimands for minor infractions. She hates Frosty the Snowman because of his \\"pagan\\" origin. She has a thing about ballpoint pens. She has a maddening, almost unshakeable certainty that looks an awful lot like prejudice at times. And yet, she is also simply -- right most of the time. She is a shrewd, experienced observer who doesn't miss a trick and is usually proved correct -- for example, she clearly has William Lunden's number when she asks Sister James if his nosebleed was self-induced!<br /><br />Probably a lot of viewers want to root for Father Flynn because he is more likeable. He tells jokes. (Sister Aloysius does, too, but her sense of humor is so dry that they tend to fall flat.) He hangs out with the kids and speaks to them about things that would concern and interest them, like how to shoot a basket or ask a girl to dance. He smiles; he is warm and physical. He says the Church must change by engaging popular culture, loosening up on secularism, and most importantly by showing that priests and religious are just like everyone else. This will appeal to many contemporary American viewers.<br /><br />Yet this warm and charismatic man, who I think genuinely sees himself as a liberator and a champion, is also a callous, louche, loose-lipped sensualist. We see this most strikingly in the dinner he shares with the delightedly laughing bishop: Red-faced, shoveling in rare beef and swilling alcohol, his eyes gleaming with meanspirited glee, he can barely contain himself as he regales his dining companions with a cruel personal story about a woman who more than likely is or was his parishioner, under his spiritual care. The contrast between this self-indulgent and ill-mannered meal is in painful contrast to the humble, ascetic dinner shared by the sisters, who eat the gristle with their meat and quietly drink milk.<br /><br />We know that this man is vain and of questionable masculinity (at least according to the conventions of the time) because he fusses over his long, immaculate fingernails. His comment about the length of his nails is interesting: Yes, they're \\"a little long\\", but they're clean, and that makes it all right. One wonders what other kinds of unusual behavior he considers acceptable as long as one observes the niceties.<br /><br />He talks more than once about compassion, highlighting his own. But is he so compassionate? Look at the way he interacts with Donald Miller, the lone black student he has taken under his wing. After the Mass that opens the movie, the boy looks at his adored pastor with shining eyes and a shy, confiding smile and tells him that he wants to be a priest. What would the proper response be? Couldn't Father Flynn have taken a few minutes to talk to the boy about whether or not he had a vocation, offering him real encouragement and giving him real feedback? Instead, he makes a throwaway comment about how Donald would surely make a good priest, then gives him a little toy. Does he even take the boy's expressed wish seriously? (And what an interesting toy! A scantily clad dancer spinning endlessly in front of a mirror, perhaps a subtle reference to Father's exhibitionism and narcissism?)<br /><br />The other scene that really stood out for me as showing the shallow, self-serving nature of Father's vaunted compassion was the one where William Lunden grabs and spills the contents of Donald Miller's book bag in the middle of a busy hallway. A caring adult witnessing this scene would come to Donald's aid, help him pick up his things, maybe offer a quick, encouraging word. That wouldn't be good enough for Father Flynn! Instead of offering him practical assistance, he takes the boy in his arms and cuddles him, right there in the hall with other students bumping past, in a way that might be appropriate for a very small child, but certainly not for a middle schooler, especially a boy! Does this look caring, or does it look like showy behavior that only serves to make Donald look even more conspicuous than he already is? And more suspect.<br /><br />Contrast this with Sister Aloysius' behind-the-scenes concern for Donald. In her talk with Sister James, she makes clear that when a student hits Donald, it will be for the last time. When discussing the Christmas pageant, she is concerned that he be equally included with the other students but not made to stand out. In her much-noted scene with Donald's mother, her distress for the boy -- for his innocence, for the injustice of his situation, for his victimization at the hands of his violent father -- is clear. This scene, incidentally, is a standout not just for the superb acting on both sides -- doesn't Viola Davis tear up the screen in her brief appearance! Wow! -- but for its painful depiction of two women talking past each other, unable to understand each other, both wanting to protect Donald but at loggerheads because of the different share of power each woman has in the world. As a black woman in the '60s married to a brutal, unloving man, Mrs. Miller has almost none. Sister Aloysius has some, but mostly in the fact that she is highly intelligent and willing to be ruthless in the pursuit of right. She sees the long view, which includes Donald's soul and his future emotional intactness, whereas Mrs. Miller, inescably constrained by circumstance, can only see till June. Yet both women care deeply for the boy, whereas Father cares for how he personally is seen. He cares very much that he should be the one Sister James sees as looking out for Donald; he tells her as much, bluntly, in words that mirror those of an emotionally abusive parent castigating an ex-spouse to a child.<br /><br />I found it striking that whereas Sisters James and Aloysius both do what they can to preserve the innocence of the flirtatious girl (I can't remember her name), Father Flynn encourages her (shudder!) to tell the boy with whom she was \\"in love\\" all about her feelings. Who is more careful of the well-being of that child, the sisters or Father?<br /><br />Abusers come in all styles and persuasions, with some, like Father Flynn, priding themselves on being progressives, and others more conservative and traditional. The propensity to be an abuser has nothing to do with theological orthodoxy, politics, or personality type. However, FatherFlynn reveals himself to be hypocritical in his progressiveness. For all that he waxes passionate about priests and religious coming down among the people and showing themselves to be no different, he sure doesn't like it when his privileged position is challenged, pulling rank on Sister Aloysius as he belligerently reminds her of her vows of obedience and the fact that she has no right to ask a fellow nun about his past behavior. This follows a great deal of disrespectful and inappropriate behavior toward her: belittling her to her subordinate (\\"The dragon is hungry\\" comment at the beginning), openly digging at her during their first meeting by letting her know pointedly that he is going to give a sermon on intolerance, indirectly accusing her of \\"gossip\\" simply for doing her job and asking questions about his suspicious behavior (which she has the right and responsibility to do as principal), twitting her about her Lenten sacrifice of sugar, and taking her seat behind the desk in her own office. His progressiveness is merely self-serving, something that allows him to do what he wants while still enjoying the perks of kingly authority over the sisters, lavish meals every night, the ear of the admiring bishop.<br /><br />When Sister Aloysius breaks down at the movie's close and tearfully confesses her \\"doubts\\", I don't think she is saying that she doubts Father Flynn's guilt. I think she is deeply distressed that her move to protect the boys at her school has resulted in Father having unlimited access to the boys of another school; I think she doubts the hierarchy that is not doing its job of shepherding and protecting the flock; she is disillusioned by the painfully apparent good ole boys' network that keeps her from being able to do her job and protect the students under her care; and I think she doubts God, Who allows evil to flourish.<br /><br />I can agree neither with Sister Aloysius' dishonesty, her ruthlessness in forcing a confession, nor her attitude toward addressing wrongdoing. Does one really step away from God \\"in His service\\" when making a move to redress wrong? How can it be so? Yet what a powerful, anguished portrait of what can happen to someone spiritually when struggling for justice in the face of appalling abuse of power and the failure of those in charge to listen.included with the other students but not made to stand out. In her much-noted scene with Donald's mother, her distress for the boy -- for his innocence, for the injustice of his situation, for his victimization at the hands of his violent father -- is clear. This scene, incidentally, is a standout not just for the superb acting on both sides -- doesn't Viola Davis tear up the screen in her brief appearance!

His progressiveness is merely self-serving, something that allows him to do what he wants while still enjoying the perks of kingly authority over the sisters, lavish meals every night, the ear of the admiring bishop.<br /><br />When Sister Aloysius breaks down at the movie's close and tearfully confesses her \\"doubts\\", I don't think she is saying that she doubts Father Flynn's guilt. I think she is deeply distressed that her move to protect the boys at her school has resulted in Father having unlimited access to the boys of another school; I think she doubts the hierarchy that is not doing its job of shepherding and protecting the flock; she is disillusioned by the painfully apparent good ole boys' network that keeps her from being able to do her job and protect the students under her care; and I think she doubts God, Who allows evil to flourish.<br /><br />I can agree neither with Sister Aloysius' dishonesty, her ruthlessness in forcing a confession, nor her attitude toward addressing wrongdoing. Does one really step away from God \\"in His service\\" when making a move to redress wrong? How can it be so? Yet what a powerful, anguished portrait of what can happen to someone spiritually when struggling for justice in the face of appalling abuse of power and the failure of those in charge to listen.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|Darcy doesn't behave as the Darcy should.  The characters don't seem to be themselves on the whole.  Elizabeth is flat and Darcy, gasp, plays second fiddle to a moody and demanding Colonel Fitzwilliam.  All in all it doesn't read like a sequel should.  Putting that aside, however, it was a guilty pleasure and at times enjoyable as long as you pretend that Darcy and Elizabeth are brand new characters unassociated with your old favorites.  Also, the mystery was an unengaging side note.  Who cares if Wickham spends the rest of his life in jail?  Everyone knows he deserves to for something.
B00B769XB8|4.0|An action flick w/o much plot. Don't think about it just enjoy it!! I want to see it in 3D & see the difference.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 b/c as even the author has admitted, it is not the best work of fiction (as far as things like grammar and the like go).  However, it has IMO an excellent story line that draws you in and doesn't let go.  I have a good marriage, but boy did this help to spice it up!  If you are married and would like to ignite a huge fire in the bedroom, read this book!  ;)  Please note:  This book is for adults!

0765325950|5.0|I am not going to replay the whole book, nor get into the prose or character development discussions that some are more concerned with. What I will say is that this book was thoroughly entertaining.I am 42 years old and have been reading this series  since the beginning, and I must say that A Memory of Light was all that I hoped it would be. It gets right to the action from page one and does not let up until the final page. While I can tell it is not Robert Jordan writing, Brandon Sanderson does the book justice, and does blend well with Jordans style. In my opinion TWOT is the best series that I have ever read, and I have read most over the years. I am not trying to debate with The Song of Ice and Fire, Lord of the Rings, Death Gate Cycle, all of the Rastlin books , Mistborn, Night Angel trilogy, Kingdom Of Thorn and Bone or any of the Hundreds of good (and not so good) books/ series I have read. I simply enjoyed these the best. To me it would be hard not to be entertained by AMOL.

1609611543|4.0|I’m always looking for ways to improve eating habits and control weight, so when local media started hyping this book, I bought a copy. The book is packed with interesting information, including a detailed analysis of how and why wheat consumption is affecting our health in various ways. Most startling was the revelation that so much hybrid manipulation has occurred in the past sixty years that the 14-chromosome species of wheat our grandparents ate doesn’t bear much resemblance to the 42-chromosome, nitrate-saturated stuff we’re consuming in huge quantities today. The changes have added 14% more gluten to wheat, and caused a spike in Celiac disease.<br /><br />The author’s position, which he often repeats, is that wheat is an unhealthy food which should be banished from our diet. The evidence Dr. William Davis provides is thought provoking, yet almost too detailed at times. You know you’re in for a long haul when he starts a topic with, “This will all make sense in just a few paragraphs”. Sticking with the info might require more effort than some readers are prepared to spend. Still, there are excellent points in the book. Anyone with chronic conditions including Diabetes, joint pain, rashes, fatigue, and digestive problems, among others, should at least take a close look at the book and then share any concerns with their doctor.
B001AFF25W|5.0|I have been meaning to read this book since I bought it back in 2011 but because I am very good at procrastinating I managed to put it off!  It has proved its worth already because I have spent the last two days completing a complicated paperwork task which involved putting together lots of information from all sorts of places and collating it into a coherent whole.  I’ve been putting off doing this for the last two months.  In the spirit of the book I decided that this was the frog I really needed to ‘eat’ so that I could get on with my life.  If it does nothing else for me the book has proved worth its purchase price.<br /><br />The book – as its title states – contains twenty one ways to stop procrastinating and start doing those jobs that you really can’t face.  If you do something you don’t like doing first thing in the morning you will get such a boost from achieving it that you could find the rest of the day is much more productive than usual.  Anyone who has read any literature in the field will be familiar with some of the suggested ways of bypassing your procrastination instinct such as prioritising, making lists, the Swiss Cheese method (i.e. attacking small chunks of a bigger task so that eventually the bigger task begins to resemble a piece of Swiss Cheese full of holes).<br /><br />I found this book very readable, interesting and inspiring.  If you are a procrastinator then you may find it helpful, especially if you are putting off doing something that you know will improve your life if you just got down and did it.  You may find that large frog is just not as big and as unpalatable as you think it is once you get started on it.  Frogs don’t have to be eaten in one gulp either and can be eaten in bite sized chunks over a period of time. If you only read one book on procrastination then make it this one.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I recently read The Hunger Games trilogy in marathon-style and overall enjoyed the series. I thought Catching Fire was the strongest book. Mockingjay tried to tie up all the loose ends of the series, and seemed a bit forced in places. The narrator is very human, but I lost patience with her in this, the final book.  In my opinion, the book ended abruptly without much resolution (i realize this may have been intentional). I enjoyed the series, but Mockingjay was the weakest book.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|This recreation of the &#34;Battle of Gettsburg&#34; leading up too and through and the post battle was terrific. The actors and costumes were very authentic The skirmishes that lead up to the main battle were very realistic and had great sound especially the &#34;Cannon Scene&#34; in the main battle. If you have an HDTV with 5.1 surround sound you will enjoy this Blu-ray DVD as it was meant to be enjoyed by the producers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed The Hunger Games trilogy greatly. In my opinion, Catching Fire was the best of the series. The story had a good pace and the chapter-ending cliffhangers kept me reading late into the night. I liked the direction the story took in this book. I  rate Catching Fire highly because I never had to struggle to keep going. This was true of Books 1 & 2, but to me the series slowed in the final book. Overall, I enjoyed the series and think anyone who enjoys a fast-paced novel would as well.

B008O69SZ0|5.0|When I purchased this collection I was hoping that there would be some good songs and that it would be a decent CD --- and I would be fine with that. Boy, was I wrong! This isn't a decent CD nor are there a 'few' good songs. This is a GREAT CD and is truly the best complete collection of Hunter tunes ever, and that includes MTH days *(and I was/am a big MTH fan). In fact, the biggest problem with this album (and I know that ages me but, hey, they're ALL albums still to me) is trying to pick a favorite song.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Comfortable\\", the best Hunter opening tune since Once Bitten, Tiwce Shy. This is a straigh rocker that gets the record off to a great start. Other memorable tunes are the title track,  \\"When I'm President\\", which has sort of a country-rock feel to it and a chorus that never seems to exit my mind; \\"What For\\", a great, straight-ahead rocker; the fun, melodic, toe-tapping \\"Saint'; and an absolutely great bluesy-rocker called \\"I Don't Know What You Want\\".<br /><br />And this is where my only criticism of the album comes into play as this would have been a great song to end the album with. Instead, the next song, \\"Life\\", ends the album --  a slow song that is probably the collection's weakest track.<br />But, hey, if that's the worst to be said about \\"When I'm President\\" -- and it is -- then you need to order this NOW. After all, this isn't just a great Ian Hunter album --- it's a great album, period, and one of the best collection I've heard from any artist - solo or group - in quite some time.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I originally found this book as one of my ads on my Kindle while i was reading my usually generic and unorginal books. I wanted to try something different so I thought why not?<br /><br />The book in the first maybe four mini chapters is easy to get through but for me part of when August first went to meet people at his school and the first few days of school was hard to get through. After that you could say that it's easier to get into and addicting.<br /><br />Wonder often rapidly changes emotions, one minute something's funny another you feel sad. But the book is so well written that you feel these emotions with the characters as if they're real people.<br /><br />I have to admit, I did'nt really like the idea how they switched the speaker and point of view but it worked out fine. Plus some of the ones end to 'early' and then they jump into a different character's prospective without getting to hear more.<br /><br />In conclusion, Wonder is an amazingly written book about a boy whos special. Worth the five star rating. A must buy! Please make a sequel;]<br />~Emma,13,CA

The people who wrote bad reviews don't get it.<br /><br />The subtleties of Daniel-Day's mannerisms, emotional struggles with his son,<br />the character Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel-day Lewis,<br />is one of his best performances yet.<br /><br />The soundtrack is done by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood.<br />It is unique to say the least.  I love it.<br />The dissonance in his score cradles the struggles throughout the movie<br />leaving you anxious to see what will happen.<br /><br />In our ever-growing world of now now now, this movie is for the patient.

B008G12ERC|5.0|I thought this album was great. I am a new Muse fan and I generally listen to pop, so maybe that's why I don't feel any of the disappointment many other reviewers are commenting on. I personally think that almost all the songs in this album are great! Even the dubstep one is pretty cool, though I'm glad that there's only one. The bassist's two songs are only ok, but I can still listen to them; it's not like they're terrible. My favorites are Supremacy, Madness, Animals, and Big Freeze. They are wonderful to listen to! To those of you out there that normally listen to just pop, don't be afraid to try this out! Even if a few songs don't sound quite right, Matt Bellamy's voice just grows on you. He's awesome!

0812993292|5.0|Newly retired Harold Fry receives a letter from an old coworker and friend Queenie Hennessy, who he hasn't seen in twenty years.  She has terminal cancer and is living at a Hospice facility in the northern most reaches of England, she doesn't have much time left.  Harold living at one of the most southern points of the country, pens a note and walks to the post box at the end of the drive to drop it in when he changes his mind and decides that maybe his note isn't enough.  Maybe he needs to see Queenie. He begins walking and thinking about his life and talking to people along the way.  He embarks on what seems like a crazy endeavor, he's going to walk to Queenie, he's going to walk six hundred miles to see his old friend and he believes that she won't die as long as he keeps walking.<br /><br />As Harold walks he remembers things he hasn't thought of in years, he remembers things he's tried very hard to forget as well.  He makes this leap of faith to walk to Queenie and realizes that if he goes back home to get a map and his cell phone or if he stops to figure out the best route to take that he will not be able to complete his journey.  As he starts off he talks to people and tells them his plan to walk.  `They believed in him.  They had looked at him in his yachting shoes, and listened to what he said and they had made a decision in their hearts and minds to ignore the evidence and to imagine something bigger and something infinitely more beautiful than the obvious.'<br /><br />He meets many people along the way that offer him assistance of one kind or another and in their offer of tangible help they also bring a piece of their lives into his.  Most seem to understand the importance of what he's trying to do despite the improbability of it.  One woman offers him a plate of bread and butter and apple slices.  She says \\"You'd think walking should be the simplest thing.  Just a question of putting one foot in front of the other.  But it never ceases to amaze me how difficult the things that are supposed to be instinctive really are.\\"  She wet her lower lip with her tongue, waiting for more words.  \\"Eating\\" she said at last.  \\"That's another one.  Some people have real difficulties with that.  Talking too.  Even loving.  They can all be difficult. \\"  She watched the garden, not Harold.  \\"Sleeping\\" he said.  She turned \\"Don't you sleep?\\"  \\"Not always.\\"  He reached for more apple.  There was another silence.  Then she said, \\"Children.\\"  \\"I beg your pardon?\\"  \\"There's another one.\\"  He glanced again at her washing line, the perfect rows flowers.  He felt the resounding absence of young life.<br /><br />I really loved this book, I loved the writing, the storytelling and the way Harold's life is revealed to us.  The course his path takes as he makes his way toward Queenie, the people he meets along the way, his recollections, reflections and regrets as well as the understanding and realizations that come to him on his journey, it all has a universal feeling to it.  I thought this story was an allegory of sorts but a contemporary and accessible version that I think most people will enjoy.  I highly recommend it.fficult the things that are supposed to be instinctive really are.\\"  She wet her lower lip with her tongue, waiting for more words.  \\"Eating\\" she said at last.  \\"That's another one.

0783228457|2.0|This is one of those movies that can suck you into it it's story waiting to see what happens next, and then literally shoots itself in the head in the end. The story is about a guy who runs a small-time TV station who is looking to provide viewers with something they can not get from any other cable company. He and a colleague. stumble upon a mystery broadcast via a satellite that is picking up torture scenes from somewhere, but they don't know where. The guy thinks what he see's is what people would pay to watch, so he tries to track down the source to buy the rights to broadcast it. He soon finds he is in over his head when he begins to discover the mysteries of these broadcasts, and the effects they when you view it.<br /><br />It was a bit of a slow start, but it picked up in the middle. It's effects are decent for the time-period and it has some decent gore scenes for fans of it, but I wouldn't call this a gore movie. Nor would I call it a perverse movie, as many have said. It's more the story OF a perverse man, but you don't really see anything all that perverse, at least, not what today's audience would call perverted anyway. Maybe in 1983 it might have been, however there where way more perverse and shocking movies way before this one was made. (try Bad Boy Bubby)<br /><br />What ruined it for me was the ending. It just fell flat on it's face, and ruined what other wise could have been a terrific movie all around. But it was so anticlimactic that I don't care if I never see it ever again now. I must say tho, Jack Creley had a decent performance. I actually thought he was Vincent Price, and i'm sure he was impersonating him. He did a pretty good job of that. The rest of the actors didn't do anything much that would be a huge stand out in the highlights of their career. I see this more as just a cult favorite of those into the directer/producers work or fans of the time who hadn't seen something like it before. However, if you are like me and won't rate something just because of who is behind it and what they did in their past, then I can only give this movie 2 stars. It would have been 3 and a half had the end of the film not been cut so short and ended with a bang... or a bigger one than it did.

B005RJ68HS|5.0|Recently building my vinyl collection up. I decided to tackle my favorite albums before I go for albums mainly to add quantity. This is one of the best productions of this band. I still think it tops their latest effort 'The Hunter'. I read that they worked their tails off on 'Crack the Sky' and that 'The Hunter' recording sessions were more relaxing and they just want to do rather than re-work everything. Great album, every album is different and this one has the most work put into it, obviously. Also a great piece visually.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The plot is really good! It is something new, and different.<br />It takes another twist that I had not forseen, after reading the first book. Therefor it is both thrilling and exciting with a lot of action and many good cjaracters.<br /><br />The writing though is not very well done, and sometimes the story a bit to shallow. It works for screenwriting and the whole theme is excellent for movies, but I wouldn't concider it a good read, regarding the writing itself.<br /><br />Still, if you enjoy something different, easy reading and sci-fi, then the books are not too bad.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Can't believe this great game is free! As soon as I finish one puzzle, I'm on to the next one. I highly recommend this puzzle game. It's wonderful go-at-your-own-pace entertainment, no violence, no objectionable material, etc.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Ok app but you can't play past two screens without it going to the &#34;buy the full version&#34; and stopping the game you were playing.  It ends the game and takes you back to the options/start screen.  A little difficult to control too.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Well researched and well referenced.  Excellent argument for removing modern wheat from our diets.  Recommend this book if you care about health on a personal and/or societal level.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Nice tool--took some getting used to to prevent cutting crooked--must be patient  and take your time--colored wine bottles work the best
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The Lucky one leaves you holding your breath taking in the words as if your watching them unfold before your very eyes.The movie does not do this story justice.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this constantly!!! Large display & very easy to use.....glad I have it. I would highly recommend this app
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I had been meaning to read this book for a while...then I got the news that Chris Kyle had been shot dead while helping out another soldier with PTSD at a ranch in texas. It was extremely sad, but made me pick up the book.<br /><br />I have to admit I wasn't amazed by the writing style and the stop star choppiness of the dialogues. Sometimes I didn't know who was talking and it was a little confusing.<br /><br />The stories themselves though, were great. Sometimes Chris came across as a bit of an arrogant blood thirsty redneck.... But then you realise it takes people to build up this persona to be able to actually go to war and be an effective soldier.<br /><br />I still believe as far as sniper books go, 'sniper one' by sgt Dan Mills is by far the best modern sniper book. This is definitely in the top 5, and with some tweaking it would be a much more enjoyable read.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I don't even know where to begin...this from someone who really enjoyed the first two Craig James Bond films...but this one is a complete farce.<br /><br />First of all the antagonist (played somewhat admirably by Bardem, despite a TERRIBLE, CLICHE script) is a direct rip-off of both the Dark Knight's Joker and part Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal)...yet his character is introduced so far into the film, for the first time, that his back story is a quick, sweeping narrative about him being some disenchanted former agent, who now spends his entire life trying to ritualistically and publicly kill \\"Mom\\" or \\"M,\\" because he felt she left him hang out to dry in the past.<br /><br />Why does he do this? Apparently because, well, his cyanide capsule didn't work and just left the inner part of his face melted-off, or something like that, so he has to wear some sort of piece to hold-up his cheekbones/jaw and teeth.  He is also apparently gay, and decides not to kill Bond while he can, instead feeling him up a bit, then showing him his (unimpressive) lair, and of course giving Bond the opportunity to escape  (which somehow turns into a long-winded plan to lead him to M, that is so unrealistic and lacking in continuity I can't even get into it here).<br /><br />Any ways, he has apparently set-up camp on this remote, deserted island town where he can access just about anything imaginable - from Satellites to top secret military codes/radar equipment.  How he does all this? Who knows, he's apparently some sort of hacker too, beyond his agent skills, and seeing that his pals are literally a bunch of slobs with pee shooters, and are disposed of so easily and quickly, it escapes me completely as to how this guy managed to become such a threat, or why he would be so feared by M16 or any other group.<br /><br />So he attempts to stage these \\"Joker-like\\" plans to murder \\"M\\" (the woman behind giving Bond and all the agents their orders) in the most ridiculous, non-sensical, unbelieveablefashion imaginable, I can't even explain how he comes up with this plan that actually, somehow works, despite a million different things that could easily go wrong, only to end-up with him talking too much while holding the gun pointed at her in a no-miss situation, or Bond's, before he's foiled.  It's so cliche it's ridiculous.<br /><br />When Bond has the chance to kill him? Bond hesitates and gives him plenty of time to...set-off a bomb with his cellphone (that he points out to Bond what it is before doing so at gunpoint) and it happens to explode right above where Bond is standing somewhere in a subway tunnel of some sort in the middle of the city - amazing!<br /><br />Actually, I can't even go into how bad this film is start to finish, there is no romantic connection in this one, at least there doesn't appear to be, nor nearly enough back story on the antagonist, the stunts are completely ridiculous - as they almost choose to fight on the top of a moving train and duck for tunnels, which again is so insanely cliche and unrealistic, I found myself laughing at how stupid the whole thing was.  Almost everything about it was predictable the entire way through, despite the writers best attempts to not be predictable.  I keep waiting for it to just end...but it dragged on and on.<br /><br />And oh yeah, Bond DIES in the beginning of the film, but is somehow rescued at the bottom of a HUGE, deep river after the train fight in the middle of nowhere as if it was all planned - really???? They never explain how exactly this happened (a brief scene during the intro song of a woman grabbing him down below in the water as he sank - was she a mermaid?), and he just comes back to life months later. And oh yeah, he was shot twice, fell hundreds of feet from a train bridge, and it was all, well maybe, planned...or not.  Who knows, it was ridiculous.<br /><br />This movie is for the mindless, a bunch of cliche action scenes and plot lines, directly ripped-off from other films I mentioned, has no consistency or continuity, is not even realistic or believeable, even by Bond movie standards, and is easily the worst of the bunch IMO.<br /><br />I don't know what everyone is smoking or thinking when it comes to this film, I really don't.  It's awful in every sense of the word, start to finish.  Good cinematography aside, I just don't understand why so many people actually like it!! Why!!??  All of the 4 and 5 star reviews here are simply one-liners (\\"Best Bond ever!\\" \\"Great movie!\\")<br /><br />It's a huge black eye on the Bond series, and even some of the poorer ones of the past surpass this hunk of Hollywood action, violence-obsessed garbage.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|loved to play it. great graphics. the game was long enough with many twist and turns but the ending wasnt great it left you hanging and want more.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Since it was a gift for my son in law I never got to hear the music.  The cd arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and I was very satisfied with packaging and time from ordering to receiving it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I try just about anything as a reader but this series lacked so much. The characters were annoying and the writing wasn't very well crafted. The love story was nice though. I found myself boored with the sex...yes, I know that seems odd but really after the first few it became too much. I don't know I guess I like it when there is something left to imagine.
B001S86J0I|4.0|When Tim and Sigourney are going through the chompers, what does she say? I know in the original movie she says the F word and thats the copy I would like to have.
1469203820|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the KingKiller Chronicles and even though I read the series I am listening to them again. It makes my commutes to and from work much more bearable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this book because you can never tell what happens next. The context clues try to confuse you, but you mighht be thinking about another clue to the problem in the book. Each character is unusual, but it feels as if I know them. The characters feel like they will talk to you then to each other.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I sailed through the first three books, hungrily absorbing the characters and unusual story lines.  When I got to book four I was frustrated.  The characters I knew and love were gone and the remnants got very little done.  I was introduced to new characters I had a hard time finding interesting.  Nevertheless, I finished the book with hopes that book five would be right back on track.  Well, it has been months and I have yet to finish the book.  Whenever I get a few moments I try to finish reading the books but find myself doing something else.  I am going to make a real effort to finish this book and when I do I may add to this review but until then... assume that I haven't.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love the way the author makes the reader love the unloveable - a presumably dead garden and children who had been given up for uncontrollable, lost and even dying.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a must read. I am a pre med student and this book helped to inspire and motivate me to be led by faith and to continue sharing my story to help and teach others as Eben has in this book. You hear a lot about NDE`s but nothing like this and its even more special because  of the transformation you see within Eben.
B002KKCVPU|5.0|These sandals are used by my brother living on a coral atoll in the Central Pacific.  Teva are the only sandals that stand up to the harsh conditions and last about 12 months.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|I laughed out loud a few times.  Don't take the movie seriously (guys with 1980s rock band hair styles but wearing wolf costumes?!) and you can have some fun with it.
B0000714BP|5.0|The movie is everything I had thought it would be!  I have watched it before and would reccomend everybody to buy a copy if they enjoy a movie about &#34;drag queens&#34; I think the only flaw of the movie is the concept of transgender women and drag queens is a tad blurred but still a wonderful movie! I am very happy with my purchase as the movie came in a sealed container and was brand new! dispite being a very old movie from the mid 90's the quality of picture is still great!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It ended very different than I thought<br /> I was very disappointed in the book I I had heard very good things a b out it before. I decided to buy. It
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this game. there are two game modes. survival and creative. this is pretty much just like the computer version and the xbox version except you don't ha e everything that you get in the other two versions. all in all amazing game. definatly worth the price. also you can play with anyone else on your world or their worlds if you have wick connection and they have minecraft pocket edition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is great!! Good picture, addicting, and fun! Good that it's free and can connect to Facebook and game center
B002ZG974M|5.0|Maybe I'm biased because I have kids, but I really think anyone would love this movie.  It doesn't even need narration, the video tells all.  I loved this movie so much that I bought it for my 2 year old daughter and she LOVES it, too.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Saw it and enjoyed it a lot.  I'll keep it to rewatch it after I forget about what happened.  The price was worth the DVD
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is a thrilling and again great book I would give it 5stars you have to read the books before this one to under stand .
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is one of the most adorable, charming horror movies ever made... and I am a fan (and a writer) of horror. It's wholly unique and the main characters will win you over instantly. You'll laugh, you'll cringe... and you will never for a moment feel this is time wasted to watch. I wish I had an amnesia pill so I could experience it's surprises over and over again.  A++
B000FA6720|5.0|A story of true love both for him and her family<br />A nice cosy read not too complicated but interesting<br />Recommend to any romantic fool
B0000AQS6R|4.0|this is a funny christmas movie. i recommend it!!!! 100 percent laughs.  good for older kids to adults.. it is very funny
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was fantastic. John Green brilliantly narrated the story of two teenagers whose lives are far from average, without causing a wave of pity for the characters. Instead, his novel is inspiring, heartwarming, and hilariously witty. I would immediately suggest this book to anyone.
B000X4IRE4|5.0|This is one of my very favorite movies, and it's a toss-up whether I like this one or Ghost Protocol best in the series. Tom Cruise is wonderful, and the rest of the cast are also brilliant. The plot is very complex, and I'd say it's a pretty unique story. The action sequences and stunts are phenomenal, as always! Highly recommended.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|game was very challenging. l did not want to stop. I was totally at a loss a few times but made it thru.here's hoping they come up with more games like this.
B001FVD65O|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! It's my favorite of the franchise. I can't remember if it had captions or not - I think it did, so that's why I'm giving it a 5 instead of a 4. My husband needs the captions and not all the movies seem to have them.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Excellent footage and music! A must own package if you are a Led Zepplin fan. includes both CDs and DVDs and they now provide access to MP3 downloads too!
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is one of the authors that not only makes History interesting he leaves you wanting to know more about the period.  This World War II Novel is so interesting to people of my age as we remember all the news reels telling the same story (without the main characters).  Can't wait for the third novel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend this to anyone and also I love horses so that's why I bought the game and the game has a new update with more unicorns and I just got a black unicorn :)
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It's a fun game to pass the time and the graphics are good. I just wish the dragons were a little more attractive.
1455508977|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie, it was a great book I'm glad I read it before the movie, it was such a quick read though I couldn't put it down. The movie didn't live up to the book though, they usually never do though.
B005PK1G76|4.0|The only issue we encountered was that it tends to slide down a bit on the Britax B-Agile stroller we have if we didn't put the velcro on tight enough. This causes your cup to tip slightly (due to the back of the stroller pushing against the organizer) and can lead to small spills.<br /><br />But it does work really nicely otherwise. We put towels and baby toys in there and they don't fall out. Super useful.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|one of the best live shows!!!this band will give you you monets worth and then some when you watch them!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I was looking for a nice and basic alarm that I could use my music for the alarm and this one works really well!
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|It was very cute, well done, in very good condition and beautiful. The second DVD is very nice. I really loved it so much.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I thought that this movie was mostly wonderful and I will start with my negative thoughts and then move on to the positive.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Is boring and slow at some parts.<br />For me, personally, there wasn't enough Robert Lincoln or Mary Lincoln<br /><br />Positives:<br />Daniel Day Lewis is the greatest actor alive and truly immerses himself into the character.<br />Sally Field was good, a little too hysterical for me at some points, but good nonetheless<br />Joseph Gordon Levitt, James Spader, Lee Pace, and Tommy Lee Jones were all phenomenal in this film, I was especially happy to see John Hawkes in this movie.<br />Music, oh my god the music really added to the mood of the movie and that opening scene at the soldier camp and the soldiers reciting the Gettysburg Address, almost my favorite scene yet.<br />James Spader as Bilbo was hilarious and added some comic relief to the serious subject<br />The House scenes were dramatic and action packed, I even got scared for a moment that the amendment wouldn't pass.<br />Again, Daniel Day Lewis as LIncoln was perfection in every way; the voice, the humor, the father, and the down to earth quality that gives us a glimpse into the life of our 16th president.<br /><br />great great great GREAT film.
B000IVW25M|4.0|It was in excellent condition but it was only in English and French with no subtitles in any other language.
6304711883|5.0|This was a very good movie This is Mel Gibson before he went crazy in real life. He can really act. It is what lengthsa father will go to get his son back. Gary Sinese was also very good in this film. One of his best films. It is a cat and mouse game and who will blink first. Love this film. A good film to watch and own.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|It was good size, very cute, well done and in very good condition. It was what was shown and I really loved it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|One of the best series ever made. Best sc-fi movies done. Better than the remakes that were made. The last one was good when Aniken turned to Darth Vader. Only one in thes 3 that was not all that was Return of the Jedi. Damn Ewoks are annoying. Watching Luke Skywalker, Han Solo Darth Vader iand the others is very entertainig. A must own for all Star Wars fans.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|It was very cute, well done and in very good condition. It was perfect. I really loved it so much.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|If you have seen all seasons od 24 then this is the same thin all over again. He fights bad guys,get betrayed and runs all over the place. Same as before and they even recycle stuff from other seasons. It is not done well. Cool to have if you like 24 and to add to collection but not all that. Making a movie in the future. No need for that as well.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|It was good size, well done and in very good condition. It was what really was shown. It was perfect.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This was a very good independent movie. Jeremy Renner was very good.Very god drama. Actors acted well. Had intense scences and it showed you want people in the armedd forces have to go through to disarm bombs. Worth getting and seeing.
B003DT19F0|5.0|It was good size, very cute, well done and in very good condition. It was what was shown and I really loved it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book in the series, makes you want  to read the next in line and if you haven't read the ones prior to this one, those too.
1591391105|4.0|It was good size and in very good condition. It was what was shown but I expected something different in the content.
0739368435|3.0|This book came highly recommended and it is interesting, but not compelling. It is a story about WW II set Guernsey Island, off the coast of England. It's a love story told in letters.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|It was good size, very cute, well done and in very good condition. It was what was shown and I really loved it.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Good grief.  My kid ordered this on my kindle and hardly plays it, but has a fit if I say I want to delete it.  To me, it's just another game that is a waste of time and energy.
1468179993|5.0|I want to give a TED Talk some day. But even if I didn't, I'd still highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to give better presentations - in person, on the Internet...anywhere - and be a more persuasive public speaker. Jeremey says multiple times that this book is specifically for people who want to get on a TED stage some day, but he's not giving himself enough credit.<br /><br />I started taking notes while reading the book, but I stopped shortly after beginning. Every other sentence was noteworthy (seriously) and I would have just copied and pasted the whole darn thing if I took notes. So I just committed to rereading it at least once a year so the principles and recommendations really sink in.<br /><br />This is 100+ quick pages of great information dissecting the best attributes of TEDTalks and the presenters. From selecting a topic, how to craft a catchphrase, how to be introduced, verbal delivery, physical delivery, and tips about good visuals, it seems to have it all. The examples and analogies are vivid and resonated strongly with me too.<br /><br />Let's just say that I didn't have a framework to prep myself for the ultimate day I'm on the TED stage before reading this book. After reading this, I had the confidence that I can do this and the tools to make the most of the chance when it comes.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Well worth the price!  Nice adventue, puzzle, hidden object mixed game that has a great story line.  Well made, great attention to detail in both the story line and gameplay.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|If this isn't the best season, it's one of the best. I absolutely love it, and love watching it over and over.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Great concept, awesome features (if they worked)... love the idea, HATE the product.  I haven't written a negative review before but this is my baby's safety we are talking about.  This isn't a money issue either.  I would pay twice as much if the stupid thing did what it was supposed to.  It consistently reads 4-5 degrees warmer in the room than in reality (not a deal breaker but annoying) half the time the audio works but the video doesn't and at least twice a night it looses connectivity all together! DEAL BREAKER! We run a business from our home and our internet connection is our livelihood so...no, it is not a connectivity/WiFi issue!  Don't trust your your baby's well being to a defective product!
B00633W614|5.0|I LOVED THE BOOK.IT'S A GREAT SEQUEL TO &#34;ONLY TIME WILL TELL&#34;, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK TO COME OUT!
1416550542|4.0|Got this book for my mother-inlaw, it just so happens she bought the paperback edition that same day we gave it to her.  Needless to say she returned the paperback and kept the hardcopy we gave her.  She was really impressed that we were able to pick out a book she would like.  I like the small introductory of the book, it really helps when you are trying to buy a book online.
B0082SU98U|4.0|The term &#34;Pollyanna&#34; is a negative thing to say about someone.  So I thought I would actually read the story.  Actually I think there is a lot to admire in the Pollyanna character.  &#34;Pollyanna&#34; means unreasonably and naively optimistic.  That is not the character I see in this book.  She is quite aware of how badly things have gone for her, yet she CHOOSES to focus on the good things around her.  Not only does it enable her to function better, but it actually brings about changes in the people around her.  I think this is an interesting moral tale.  Part of the key to happiness is finding contentment in what one already has.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a  very very very very overhauled good game for me right now  do a second indigenous be awsome<br /><br /> .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while. It made me cry, laugh, and smile. Not many books can make you do all three.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Good for many age levels, the entire family plays. High definition graphics run smoothly on the for H D. One of the better find games.
0525958002|5.0|I have been a Duran fan since... well, for a VERY long time. I was a Simon girl, so I have to say that there was a tiny part of me that wished the book had been written by SLB.<br /><br />My love for Duran Duran has grown three times it's previous side since reading this book. It's an interesting perspective as an adult to understand what was happening behind the scenes at a time when I was far too young to understand that those kinds of things happen in the music world. John's very well written memoir brought me a new appreciation for D2's music, as well as their passion for life, love and family.<br /><br />My thanks go out to a very brave John for writing this down and putting it out into the world. He will not only shed light on Duran, but also on addiction. Although my heart will always belong to Simon, a little piece of it was taken over by John after reading his very personal story.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I only wish there were more levels.  My three year old likes it and so do I.  Fun for the whole family.
B008BQ8VOC|1.0|The show is great but the sound was at least 20 seconds delayed.  It could only be watched with eyes closed.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Saw this concert on the Palladia channel this morning and lost my mind. Sade is the pinnacle of what real music sounds like. The band was absolutely magnificent. I will be purchasing this bluray this week. It is a concert that all of her fans must see !!!<br />She is still absolutely beautiful & undeniably stunning with each performance.
B00AYB1RXE|5.0|Miracles sometimes happen!  This movie is amazing and so well done.  If you want a feel good movie, this is the one.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but I bought it for my 13 year old granddaughter. She loves horses and said it was very good.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I LOVE this book. It is AWESOME! I love the details Garth Stein put in the novel. And the title , The Art of Racing of Racing in the Rain, it's just so fascinating! I will read Garth`s other 2novels and will rate them with 5 stars too. I love you Garth Stein!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played and I think there is great graphics. I reccomend this game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Pretty good book but I Liked<br /><br />THE Hunger Games better.<br />Too much violence for my taste.<br />The ending was also weak.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Passes the time and has really good graphics, I'm actually surprised and its fun to do on my kindle fire , try it out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Micro like to play and the kids does too. We even see who gets the most coins we enjoy it.
0767903374|2.0|There were some intelligent points, but a lot of the ideas were rather silly.  The reading is also boring.  Wouldn't recommend.
B00865TO4O|1.0|I found it to be another one of those failed attempts by a lawyer wanting to be a writer. The characters' individuality was non-existent; that was not the only problem: but I'll be kind and stop there.
0553062182|2.0|I didn't care for the ideas in this book.  Very boring and silly.  I couldn't read it beyond a few chapters.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was very pleased with the way Kindle handled my problem. The charger and cable solved all of my issues.
1878424319|5.0|I love Ruiz's wisdom and positive spiritual nature.  I wish there was a poster of the Four Agreements that I could put up at work to help remind me how to live on a daily basis.  I forget to follow them often and need reminders.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I purchased a TV pass and watched the episodes from Season 3 when we were both home sick.  We could not stop watching.  The acting is second to none and the drama is ongoing.  This is our favorite show and we can't wait for Season 4.  If Amazon gets the next season we will surely buy the TV pass again as that is so much easier than waiting from week to week.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game ever.  the old one would use up my battery life like that but the secound one is a.million times better.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Rango is a fun movie that has a slow start but it's more fun as it goes along.I really enjoyed all the other movie references such as the Clint Eastwood look like and the Star Wars flight scenes with the bats. Very clever and enjoyable and I'm sure I missed a lot of the references as well.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I want this game but I want it to be cheaper like 3 bucks or something but I love minecraft its cool
B009D0LBRO|5.0|best game on kindle!<br />I just love this. Me and my friends play this 24/7 a and can't get enough.
1596912855|4.0|I liked this book, as a light and interesting read. It had a twist which I did not see coming, but Jane is a believable character, and gets thrown into Austenland therapy, where we see her try and make a little more sense of her life.
0439023491|5.0|I cannot understand the negative reviews on this book...do you people not realize this book, and series, is written FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS????  The fact that you may find it repetitive and derivative is of no import; you should be reviewing ADULT literature, not young peoples'.  As an adult, almost everything I read is a rehash of SOMETHING else I've read.  Reading books for 50+ years means that I am always finding books and stories that remind me of Agatha Christie, Steinbeck, Hemingway, and even Shakespeare tales.  There is nothing new under the sun...but the descriptions can be varied to make the weather seem more interesting.  I love this book; is it as good as the first in the series?  Probably not, but it is still a better-than-average read.  If I had tween-agers, I'd be tickled pink that they found a series of books they liked to read, rather than spending their free time playing computer games.
B009M4KTEM|2.0|Nice playing and good song selection, but the producers' decision to ramp up the crowd noise is a real disappointment. In fact, upon second listening, I feel much of the hooting and whistling are probably manufactured and not even recorded at the show. This static does not help to re-create the experience of \\"being there\\", but instead creates a huge distraction to an otherwise strong recording. You will find the same problem on the Grateful Dead's \\"Go to Nassau\\" show from about this same period. One problem with downloaded music is you can't get your money back.
0439023521|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I can see why my cousins' children were so engrossed in the story.  I guess it is written for kids, but the story grabs you and pulls you along, because you just can't wait to find out what happens next.  I am a 50+ year old, who usually reads non-fiction, with a few exceptions, but I wanted a break.  Remembering a few summers ago when we had a family reunion and all the kids were reading this, I borrowed it on my Kindle.  Not sure what the few negative reviewers are thinking; maybe they're just jealous of the author's ability to grab her audience hook, line, and sinker.  I am looking forward to the author's next two books...and I haven't been able to say that about fiction since I started reading Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesomeness, it offers many items to build houses people say that 6.00 is too much to pay for a game but it is well worth the price. I have built many things on this game because it's so easy and so fun to play.there are a couple flaws though like sometimes you will be playing and if you look down it will make you look up but no big deal.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best series created in recent years. I look forward to each episode appearing in my video library.
B009HEN7LY|5.0|I loved this movie and bought it in HD. It's as brilliant as the first two but yes, different enough so that it doesn't feel like a repeat of the first 2. My husband didn't like it as much as the first two but that's only because he doesn't like to see &#34;drama&#34; in sci-fi as much as &#34;monsters&#34;. NOT that this was a drama! It was funny, smart, beautiful, with a convincingly evil &#34;Boris the Monster&#34; as the thing to overthrow and a totally unexpected ending that answered a couple of major questions: why doesn't K ever smile, and where did J come from, besides NYC?<br />If you enjoyed the first 2 movies, watch the third. It's worth it.

B002P79KAC|5.0|Okay, I'm a bit of a nerd so suppose that slightly predisposes me to liking a comedy show starring the types of people I can relate to. But the bottom line is that this is THE funnest television series I have ever seen in my life. For the first time in my life, most of which has been spent behind a book or computer rather than a t.v. set, I find myself looking forward to watching another episode, and even THINKING about one that I have seen makes me laugh out loud. As much as I have enjoyed The Simpsons, Married With Children, and even South Park, no other series has held my attention or made me laugh as hard or as often as this show has done so far. I MUST own all seasons. This is pure medicine for the laugh muscles.<br />  The initial premise is simple enough - a couple of super-smart guys (Leonard & Sheldon) share an apartment. With near-zero social skills with the opposite sex, they meet their sexy but not as smart neighbor, Penny. Add a couple of friendly sex-starved nerds with similar skill sets and hilarity reliably ensues. I noticed someone criticized the show for adding many characters as the seasons went on, &#34;losing&#34; the initial premise. I disagree. Unlike a cartoon where the characters remain pretty much the same age as when the series began, these people are moving on with their lives, growing in all ways as the audience witnesses their growing pains with sympathy and laughter. It gets better every season. I am addicted and love it.<br />And for the first time in my life, I have a desire to meet and talk with the writers of this show. THAT is how impressed I am with these guys. The writers are BRILLIANT, and a fantastic cast brings their words to life perfectly. I cannot think of one thing I do NOT like about this show! TRY it. You can see a few episodes from Season 6 for free on CBS. Then, like me, you'll probably want to see every season asap. Enjoy. Have tissues handy for the tears of laughter.

B009D7CP2M|5.0|Oh, I've been waiting to write this review. This book grabbed hold of me and did not let go until the very end. I could write an essay about some of the subtleties in the characters here; perhaps even a book, but I'll stick to some of the basics.<br /><br />Kevin is not a happy child. From the beginning, he seems to resent not only his distant mother and overweening father, but life in general. As Shriver shows us the progression of Kevin's life in tandem with a growing understanding of his mother, Eva, the parallels between the two become ever clearer. The two enter into a war of sorts, a battle of strong wills for not only Kevin's destiny but the destiny of the family itself. Kevin's escalating, increasingly unspeakable acts provide the impetus that drives the story forward, but the plot is almost incidental to this book. I stress almost, because a sole judgment of the plot misses the elements that make this book so extraordinary.<br /><br />It's all about theme and character. Yes, the central question of this book seems to be about whether a killer is born or created, ultimately demurring on the answer itself, but such a facile analysis misses the layers of complexity that Shriver weaves in attempting to answer that question. More than once Shriver intimates that Eva and her son are not so dissimilar; the key to understanding this is in a passage where Eva states that women internalize their rage while men visit it upon the world. Eva is an angry, rage-filled woman with a fury very much the equal of her son's fury, she just expresses it in a different manner, though sometimes we see the equal of Kevin's expressions, such as when she rails against the mundane qualities of everyday life.<br /><br />Kevin's father Franklin is an ineffectual man who lives in a constant haze of denial. It becomes clear that he attempts to plaster the world's disappointments and flaws over with rose-colored cellophane, seeing everything - save for his wife's increasing fear of and frustration with their son - as benign. It's little wonder that Kevin's fury toward him is even stronger than his anger toward his mother. He doesn't even hide that rage particularly well, but his father misses the insincerity time and time again, until it's too late.<br /><br />The theme here is a child who may have been born damaged in some emotional capacity but who never receives the attention that he may have needed to overcome that issue. Both parents were far too focused on their own needs, projecting their wants and insecurities onto the damaged child. Make no mistake, though, that Kevin is also a monster, and the only true innocent in this whole Greek tragedy is the daughter Celia, who ends up getting far worse than she ever deserved.<br /><br />I hated just about all of the characters on some primal level, but I couldn't look away. The whole thing formed such a perfect storm of dysfunctional family dynamics and maladaptive psychology that it's hard to imagine it ending in any other way. I can't recommend this book highly enough.tration with their son - as benign. It's little wonder that Kevin's fury toward him is even stronger than his anger toward his mother.

B0059XTUVI|2.0|The first 25 minutes of this film is watching an old person who used to be famous, but who now has dementia. Margaret Thatcher as The Iron Lady is very interesting, but we get only tiny tastes of the famous Steep powers of impersonation of Ms. Thatcher in her heyday. However, those snippets are no substitute for a fully fledged, well acted, character biopic. Got through the first hour by fast forwarding through the confused old lady bits to the few moments that dealt with Thatcher's exciting past in politics and then gave up. It just wasn't worth it.

0316212377|4.0|After [[ASIN:B0085S12EW Surface Detail]], I wondered if author Iain M Banks would be able to keep the Culture saga going.  Lately, his tales have been hit and miss.  But no worries; The Hydrogen Sonata brings another epic tale together through the perspectives of Ship Minds, Special Circumstances, and, of course, a lowly \\"innocent\\" who steps up to the plate and delivers.<br /><br />In this book, the focus is on a civilization's (Gzilt) choice to Sublime, and the process of Subliming.  In addition, there is a lot of intrigue regarding which civilizations get to raid the Gzilt system afterwards.  Seems the Gzilt were a civilization that was in on the development of, and invited to be part of, Culture, but eventually refused.  So they are a Level 8 civ, with some pretty serious technology.<br /><br />But... could there be a secret so profound that it might change the minds of most Gzilts to Sublime?<br /><br />Expect from Iain M Banks new technologies, new species, and new ways to modify the humanoid body.

B00BGD07KS|5.0|Almost Home is classic Mariah Carey song of the past and maybe that is a good thing.  Music today has turn into  pop/dance/club jam.  I don't know how much the public will buy into it.  Most of today's music lovers like the club jam type music.  Then again I feel like this maybe the one time they take time to stop dancing and enjoy what really makes music special.<br /><br />Almost Home is a song about the journey home.  Home being the dream in your heart and soul.  Believing you can get there and nothing can stop you.  Mariah Carey say's it all when she belts &#34;When You're Almost There&#34; and You're Almost Home&#34;  &#34;Just Open Up You're eye's and go&#34;, &#34;You know you're not alone&#34; &#34;You're Almost Home&#34;<br /><br />This song has what it takes to be #1 song on the billboard and be the #19 #1 hit of Mariah Carey's career.<br />But that's up to the public.

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The special effects are wonderful, but Skyfall's way too full of them (I wanted to say &#34;enough already, give us a thriller plot&#34;) and way short of compelling characters, situations and ingenious weapons that fueled previous Bond movies so effectively.

B00BF2UKDE|4.0|if you're a fan of Nick's Birthday Party or Grinderman output, this may not be your cup of tea. Personally, I prefer Nick and The Bad Seed's brooding balladry. If you liked Boatman's Call, Nocturama, and the B-Sides ..you will love this album. This is another worthy album to add to their discography and takes repeated listens to be enjoyed for its subtleties and nuances. This is the softer side of Nick , not the volatile. Oddly enough, this album has a U2 feel to it.

That being said, I am not necessarily a fan of Zombie movies, but the Resident Evil series is the best I have seen.

I have the entire series on Blu-Ray, and from time to time I will watch the movies as a marathon.  I always see something I missed in prior viewings.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was an amazing book! I ditched the book because it got so boring to me, but once I got to the games I couldn't take my hands off of it! It was better than any other book I've read by far! If you like books with plenty of action and romance, then this is the book for you! In this book, like the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta find a way to stick together. In Catching Fire there is a twist to the reaping, all of the previous victors from the last 75 years (at least, the ones who are still alive) will be entered as tributes. In the reaping, when Peeta volunteers for Haymitch, it just goes to show how much Peeta loves Katniss because he wants to protect her during the games. In the games there are many surprises. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. I wish I could give it 10!

B0037UUZQY|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this doll's hair becomes tangled (no pun intended) almost immediately. My daughter had her for one day before it became impossible to brush her hair. The extension piece is a joke--it's like a thin little mullet you attach with a barette. The doll itself is pretty and somewhat resembles the Rapunzel in the movie. My daughter loves playing with her so I guess that's all that matters!

1400067820|4.0|This is a fascinating book replete with clever points (e.g., the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence) and emphasis on some great techniques (e.g., choose options that have significant upside and minimum downside). It could be half as long, but it's inflated by one of the most immense egos in the world. Taleb must have a vast insecurity complex, because he beats you over the head every page with how smart he thinks he is, actually explaining how the book is structured and how to appreciate it. He has cosmic quirks (apparently feels orange juice is a government plot) and so unceasingly tears into his &#34;enemies&#34; (fragilistas) that you wonder just what nerve someone like Tom Friedman might have hit. If you can get through his rants and hatred of his critics, and his preposterous ego (&#34;flaneur,&#34; for example, is used everywhere, and he warns you not to read some sections which might be too tough for the reader!), there are nuggets of great insights. Unlike most sophisticated, successful thinkers, I would NOT like to have dinner with this guy.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Mike Ryan said it best in his issue in Vanity Fair when he said The Walking Dead was finally a horror show for people who hate horror. I can't express how much I hate horror films/shows but I decided to give this one a try because of how popular it is. The thing I love about TWD is that they don't have to rely on cheap scare tactics to scare you. The show is so scary because of how real it is. The storytelling is great and I just can't get enough of it.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I love all of Michael Buble's albumns....this is not becoming one of my favorites to listen to every year at Christmas, along with Bing Crosby, Elvis, etc!  Perfect albumn!
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|Loved the 1950s version since I was a kid...truly terrifying film, and most of the terror is formed in your own head, not a computer.  Hated the 1982 version! Had nothing in common with original, and while there were many gross-out scenes, I didn't find them scary. I also didn't like the characters or the way they interacted.    When I saw the trailer for this new \\"Thing\\", I couldn't believe anyone would do a remake of a remake, including the opening music. I had no plans to see it.    Then I was offered a free month of DVDs with my streaming Netflix subscription, so I ordered the blu ray version to judge it for myself figuring there was nothing to lose.    I liked it MUCH better than Carpenter's. There were several genuine jump-out-the seat scares, and the creature moved so quickly and with such voracity that it portrayed it in a whole new (and for me, more frightening) light.  Although how this milli-tentacled, crab-legged mouth-on-acid could build anything, let alone a huge spaceship, was and is beyond me.  Seems like a terrible waste of space too!    I liked the female lead, even though her character was written sooooooo Ellen Ripley-esque.  She even looked somewhat like a young Sigourney Weaver.  But I thought the actress and most of the others gave credible performances.    I don't want to spoil it for others, so I'll just say I liked it, and highly recommend it for those nights when only a creepy sci-fi horror flick will do.  Nice twist at the end!
B004LWZW9M|5.0|This is a great fun movie to watch, you feel like you were there for the ball dropping in New York!  Cute story!  I will watch it every year!
1594487154|5.0|If you are in sales, and 9 out of 9 of us are, you need to OWN this book.  Dan Pink has incredible insight and affirmation on every page for those of us who have decided to make sales our career.  Even the verbage he uses is right on - I found myself saying &#34;Amen&#34; aloud and a lot as I read.  Most have felt this marketplace shift, have shaken our heads and bitched about it - Pink helps you make sense of it all.  Go move some people now.
0375869026|5.0|My grandson thoroughly enjoyed this book.  He is an excellent reader and enjoys sports.  I picked this book so he would not become a total jock and bully other kids.  This book makes you consider your feelings as you read about each of the characters.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|They have done it yet again. They have not only answered multiple questions with with this installment but opened  that many more . We have seen Pendergast at his lowest point up until now and seen him rise above himself. What will they come up with next ? Too bad we have to wait so long to find out. Thanks boys for the magic.

B008BLBUDQ|4.0|Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe is a compelling novel that provides a unique glimpse at the seldom seen world of pre-colonial and pre-christianized tribal Africa. The everyday life, customs, and traditions of an Ibo village in Nigeria are recorded as the plight of one warrior in particular is told in tragic fashion. Driven by a fear of succumbing to the laziness and worthlessness of his father, the protagonist strives for notoriety, but mostly endures misfortunes and his world inevitably begins to unravel. The title is at first prescient, then apt, as his family, status in the tribe, and way of life all crumble to pieces. On a larger scale, the encroaching of British Colonialism begins to fracture this part of the world in the name of progress and civilization. Achebe manages to capture both the sweeping overtones and the simple human elements of his tale with a clarity of precision and subtlety that is rare.

It's like sitting at the theater watching an EPIC/documentory all in one! It covers everything from cute baby steve jobs to \\"make way for the macintosh\\"! But in a way that dosn't bore or get lame. \\"Steve Jobs\\" covers every major product launch from the apple 2 to the Iphone to the IPad! Even if you weren't around for the 1984 Macintosh Product launch, you will feel like you were! Not to mention a great ending that leaves you thinking,...Wow...! Try \\"Steve Jobs\\" by walter Issacson!

0670034711|5.0|After seeing the movie, I wanted to read the book. I loved this book! Liz Gilbert is a very gifted writer.  I was able to identify with her desire to connect with her spirituality.  The detailed account of her journey made me feel as if I was there with her.  I respected her honesty, and identified with some of her her struggles and her insights. If you saw the movie, reading the book will fill in a lot of the blanks, and I think you will enjoy the read.
B009MJU52I|1.0|This is the worst model I have ever seen. The fan of feathers are made of a hard plastic. It is like someone broke an ash tray in half and used one side for the back. The eyes on the feathers look as if black dots were put in the mold. The back it green, no blue at all. The spots were thin enough to see through I guess should look as if it's feathers, but it does not. NBC network would be embarrassed to be represented by him. This is not worth the cost.

1907523588|5.0|Virginia Wool's novel To the Lighthouse is a tour de force in the masterful use of English prose.  In some instances, brilliantly skillful use of language seems to become an end in itself. without regard for the substance of the story being told.  For one as talented as Virginia Woolf, this linguistic excess seems easy to forgive.  She can, I think, be excused for overdoing a bit what she does best.<br /><br />To the Lighthouse manifests the themes and stylistic distinctiveness of early 20th Century modernism even more strikingly than Woolf's later novel Mrs. Dalloway.  To the Lighthouse is a nonlinear overlay of things unspoken, based almost entirely on accounts of conversations and feelings that one has within one's self, while betraying little of importance to others.  This gives us a world that is often not even remotely connected with what seems to be its object.  In truth, there exists a multiplicity of simultaneously occurring, overlapping worlds, each belonging to a character having his or her own place, inaccessible, for the most part, to others.<br /><br />Nevertheless, compelling conversations occur, bespeaking the power of a vague frown, a wistful smile, a barely discernible nod, or a meeting of eyes across a crowded dinner table fraught with inconsequential social conventions.  The more familiar the interlocutors, the richer the wordless exchange.<br /><br />The interior worlds described by Woolf are complex and varied places, internally contradictory, and quite unstable.  Though each of us is a creature of his or her own world, others are essential constituents.  In them we discern youth, beauty, sadness, cruelty, surly self-importance, grace, need, intelligence, satisfaction, rage ... all the attributes and faculties that we use in constituting our own lived experience.  Without saying so -- perhaps without recognition -- we rely on others to make our world understandable and livable.  Should an other die, say one who seemed to have a way, just through her presence, of holding things together in an interpretable whole, we are bereft, filled with a sense of loss, perhaps even angry with her for leaving.  After all, her passing has revealed the instability of our very self.<br /><br />Uselfconsciously, we search for anchorages.  But we are faced with repeated discovery that, in the long run, everyone else is just as unreliably subject to unanticipated change as we are.  None of this has to do with character flaws, but is inherent in our nature.  One of the characters in To the Lighthouse, reflecting on loss, aging, and uncertainty asks, \\"What does it all mean?\\"  But Virginia Woolf is not interested in \\"What does it all mean?\\" or \\"What does it mean to be?\\"or similarly final metaphysical questions born in the hubris of professional philosophers.  She asks and brilliantly answers a different question of more immediate importance:  \\"What is it like to be?\\"<br /><br />In his book After Theory, Terry Eagleton offers the judgment that post-modernism is best understood as just an extension of early 20th Century modernism.  Perhaps he was thinking of Virginia Woolf's novels when he reached this conclusion.  I can't imagine a better statement as to the nature of our face-to-face social world and the lives of those who constitute it than To the Lighthouse.  It is a challenging existentialist masterpiece.h her presence, of holding things together in an interpretable whole, we are bereft, filled with a sense of loss, perhaps even angry with her for leaving.

B00AHTYI5M|1.0|This was a most twisted, propagandistic piece of garbage! The truth of the story of the rescue of these six people was suspenseful enough to make a good movie without resorting to cheap Hollywood maneuvers such as the police cars chasing out on the tarmac at the Teheran airport, trying to stop the plane carrying the Americans to safety. (There  were many other cheap, sensationalistic tricks, too, but you get the point -- and the level to which film makers will sink to sell their product.)<br />To learn what really happened, look at the Canadian documentary \\"Canadian Caper\\" on YouTube.

B008XG1X18|3.0|This app was working great until it did an update today. After the update, the like button is missing. I used this option frequently and would like to have it available again. Once the like button is back in the app, I would give it 5 stars.
1612183956|4.0|This was honestly not the book that I expected it to be.  I found the first part of the book to be a thrilling page turner.  It started as a traditional mystery type book, with some odd twists.  However, as the book progresses, it gets odder and odder.  I found it enjoyable, and exciting.  However, I am certain some readers will be turned off by the odd direction the author goes in.<br /><br />The conclusion of the book was a bit bizarre, but exciting.  I honestly found the choices of the main character to be odd a the end, but overall, this was a good read.  You simply must know that this is as much sci fi as it is mystery.<br /><br />If you are in an airport looking for a good page turner for a trip, this is a winner, as long as you are willing to suspend belief just a bit.
1936719010|5.0|This book offers a great kick in the pants for people that have a tendency to mull around and not 'Do the Work'. (People like me!) Not only does Steven Pressfield use humour and wit to his advantage, there's a lot of solid advice in here as well. DEFINITELY a must read! Buy this book!
B004R0YHI0|5.0|As is stated at the beginning of the movie; &#34;truth against power&#34; is a real as it gets. The dysfunctional intelligence and other agencies along with the power of the White House demonstrate the lethal realities now in existence in our governements.<br /><br />How many more has this methodology effected and were unable or unwilling to come forward?<br /><br />Hollywood did a great job translating this true event into a movie!
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I do like this series. Quite a lot. I don't see Tom Cruise as Reacher at all, though. Tom Hardy would be much better.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Well, I do so love Grey's Anatomy.  I do not have any kind of TV programming, so I watch movies or DVD series like this.  It's great. I realize that some think of these serial programs as night time &#34;soaps&#34;, but I don't view them as such.  I love the characters and the stories.
0345525558|5.0|Victoria's story takes a hard look at the foster care system and how it fails so many of our children. Leaving them with little hope for the future. Despite all the pain and damage she endures, Victoria is surprisingly one of the \\"lucky\\" ones. She meets Elizabeth who can only be described as a Saint. She enters Victoria's life at just the right time and through patience and love helps a dark little girl realize some happiness and joy even if for a brief time. Filled with surprising twists and deep emotion, the author does a fabulous job weaving a story of love, loss, deception and redemption through the language of flowers, a long-forgotten art form. This story will undoubtedly touch your heart.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is a quick read, and certainly an enjoyable one.  As many other reviewers have noted, his sentences are short and succinct, but it goes along with the character.  I look forward to reading more Jack Reacher novels.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|In my opinion the format allowed the author to avoid developing complex characters and a real plot.  I am sure some folks like it but it was too disjointed for me.  More fit for a short story than a novel.

B008WCP2PG|3.0|I was disappointed in the actual movie because I was expecting it to be more funny.  It was more harsh reality than I was prepared for.  The dancing was good but Mathew McConaghay was a jerk in this film.....and I was thinking he'd be more fun too.  All in all it was not my cup of tea.

0761169431|4.0|STAR WARS Origami is a lovely, official-looking book, with glossy cover and full color pages.  Chris Alexander includes a back section of specially printed papers that will make the origami models look exactly like the originals, with all the right colors and pattern.  Because of this, the book will be missing the entire back section once you are done with all of the models.  Personally, I think the book would be better if spiral bound, so it would still be a functional book at that point.  More than half of the models will still look fine when done with ordinary paper, and the trivia pages will also be usable after all of the fancy paper is gone.  The book isn't kidding when it says it is for 8 and up, based on the reading level alone, though I would say that while I myself started doing origami at age 8, what I did then was easier than these.<br /><br />My main purpose in reviewing, however, is to advise those who purchase STAR WARS Origami.  If you have never done origami before, make sure you practice with plain paper before using the included papers.  This way, you have the freedom to make mistakes the first time, and will already know what you are doing when you make your display models.  Practice the folds shown at the beginning of the book, especially the inversion fold, as Chris Alexander utilizes it often, and I find it tricky to do at times.  Also, pay close attention to the orientation of the fancy paper and when it gets turned in different directions, to be sure things end up in the right places.  I personally tend to lose track of which side is which, and would end up making everything turn out wrong, because I am used to working with solid color paper.<br /><br />While the level of difficulty of individual models is included, I would say that the book overall is maybe level two origami--it would be better to have some prior experience, but none of these are the super hard math based models the experts make and display at origami shows.  Kids may needadult helpers to make sure they aren't skipping steps, or to help them figure out how pictures translate into what they are doing.  There was only one model I could not complete due to not understanding the directions, the cloner alien from Kamino, which I thought might have failed to show what was happening in certain steps.  Everything else was good, and I especially enjoyed how Slave I, Boba and Jango Fett's ship, turned out, as well as Luke's landspeeder.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the contradicting sections of this story and how they use each other to play of one another. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a little spasm in their or story.

B007EECSFA|5.0|One of the best books I've read Nina long time! As soon as you think you know the story and what's going to happen next, you are proved wrong. This book has you stunned with twists, turns and secrets right up to the lasts page. This was my first book by Kate Morton, and I think I will be reading more from her. A wonderful writer. Don't let the length of the book discourage you, it will keep you entertained. You will not want to put it down!

0525953728|5.0|Well-written, objective, not self-centered, accurate, I am running out of compliments for that book.  One of the best report of special forces, not portraying them as invincible super-heroes, but as men with a mission, aware of their strengths and limitations.<br /><br />Thank you to the author for both the book and service.
B003N0XDT4|4.0|I've found this to be a quality D/A converter and audio amplifier.<br /><br />The signal to noise ratio seems to be higher than any PC sound card, integrated laptop audio, or portable mp3 device. This means you won't hear buzz or hum when the music is quiet and the volume is high. It is a good solution for decoding music files from a PC or using the line-out functionality of an iPhone or iPod to get a higher signal to noise ratio.<br /><br />The power output is quite good. It's rated at 150 milliwatts at 16 ohms, which it seems to be good for. Compared to integrated desktop audio, it sounds 10-15 decibels louder when driving the same set of speakers. Right now, I'm powering a pair of Sony SS-B1000 passive bookshelf speakers with this amp, and the E7 drives them to adequate listening levels. Even though this amp was made for driving 16-150 ohm headphones, it still sounds great powering small 8 ohm bookshelf speakers.<br /><br />It also easily drives my Beyerdynamic 80 Ohm headphones, with 6 decibels of headroom left over for bass adjustment. I have also used this amplifier for movies, powering 4 sets of headphones and earbuds simultaneously using two headphone jack splitters with built-in potentiometers to suite everyone's individual volume preference. The fact that this device has two 3.5mm jacks for output really cuts down on unnecessary clutter.<br /><br />The battery life is great. Probably won't get what it's rated for, but I can see the battery lasting 20-30 hours.<br /><br />The bass adjustment is nearly worthless. The level 1 setting mildly increases bass, but increases far too wide of a range of bass frequencies (from 20 hertz to 130 hertz). It would have worked far better to increase only the 20-90 hertz range, which would make many different kinds of headphones and earbuds sound better. Bass level 2 and 3 cause rampant distortion and further over-accentuate the midbass (120 hertz). I always leave this setting on level 0.<br /><br />Overall, this is a greatpurchase if you need a good digital to analog converter and amplifier combo.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|really didn't like it.  Not for me I guess, you may like it, I just felt that it was subpar in almost all categories... and I really didn't like the frontal nudity of the 3 breasted lady in the movie.  weird.

B006ISJQ1W|5.0|A jump down not one, but nearly a half dozen rabbit holes.  While the plot is straight forward and unhampered with needless twists and turns, each scene is bright, compelling, filled with wit and wisdom, played out understated and over the top, while laced outright internal stoner laughter.  Sure Johnny is they hype, but there's not one character who does not carry their own weight and more, revealing a true to life saga from America's past that's well worth the time and memories it brings.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very fun and if you can not have a horse at home, it makes you feel like you do.  Lots of fun games and competition.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Neil Young has left behind a wealth of astonishing original hits that don't just sound good, they touch a person's soul.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best ap ever get it you will love it .it is so fun training a almost real horse
B0006N20RC|1.0|We got two copies of this show.  It looks like it was great but both of them (from different sources) had lip sync. problems and honestly I cannot stand to watch that....it never corrected itself.  The first refunded the money without us sending it back.  The second demanded it be returned for a refund....cost more than it was worth to send it back. we still have it....want a copy?
B008MM9630|5.0|Game is easy to play. my daughter and I enjoy playing this game, and by doing the quest you can earn crystals with out having to buy them unless you choose to.
B00867GKIK|5.0|We love this movie so much that I had to purchase a new copy because I haven' t the slightest idea where our other copy got up and went. There isn't much 3D to see in this movie, but we love it anyways. Up is one of the best animated movies.
B000002GZ1|5.0|Heard them in summer of 69 and they blew me away.  All I had from back then was the soundtrack from an 'event' where I got wet with a couple of people just to stand and listen to them and several other groups.  Why didn't this group become a 5 or 10 album top group ?  Great music.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|It's exactly what I expected from this incredible artist.  Thank you Phillip!<br /><br />I have this in the car and have worn the CD out!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Alright, so I purchased this Audio-Technica Lav Mic because I needed a cheap, effective lav mic on a budget. Sure if you go out and spend a few hundred and up on a nice lav mic it'll sound great, but for budget minded shooters this is a great lav to have in the bag. The sound is pretty good, especially plugged into the Zoom H1. Paired together with the H1 and you have an inexpensive wireless audio solution, if you don't mind syncing audio in post(which i don't).
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have loved this band from the first time I heard them.  You will NOT be disappointed in this CD as it's simply a continuation of the first incredible release!<br />Keep going Mumford!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I began my Gillian Flynn binge with Gone Girl and am now starting from her beginnings. This is a spooky story. Beautiful and creepily told. It's no Gone Girl, but she had to start somewhere. And this was an excellent place from which to start.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The game is addicting. Fast paced. A lot of action. Plenty of challenges. A must have for any RPG/MMO fan. Thank you Gameloft!!
B000FC10WU|4.0|When the body of a young woman is found in the library of a couple, the mystery is on. This was a little slow starting, but picked up speed and had enough twists and turns to keep me guessing. Very good.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is awesome! And it is even better if you like rpg games too<br /> Great arenas and very good gear+gameplay
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I have seen other bags in this price range and this is the best one yet. This is bigger than it looks. I posted an image next to a 20 oz soda and this bag is slightly bigger. I carry my Canon Rebel XSI with the 18-55mm lens, a [[ASIN:B001QWGXL6 SealLine Storm Sack 10-Liter Dry Bag]], a couple of filters, an extra battery, an extra memory card, and soon a macro lens. This bag doesn't feel over weight. It is made of sturdy feeling material, the straps and zippers feel strong, and feels like it will last a long time. I plan on updating this after 6 months and a few trips. Currently I am in a photo class and my larger bag is much to much to carry around.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Honestly, I initially thought this was just another teen book but I thoroughly enjoyed the story and was happy to read it.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Google play has released the newest version of SwiftKey that has flow enabled while amazon only had version 3.1. Amazon always seems to be weeks if not months behind Google play store when it comes to updates
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is the fifth book Iv read by Mitch Albom & the best yet! His writings touch the heart.  This book makes the reader take a second look at their own faith.  Great job, Mitch!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I gave it five stars because I loved every character, loved the costumes and loved the set details. The two leads never raise their voices above a monotone, yet they have so much youthful emotion welling upside that their behaviour is essentially bezerk wrapped in reasonable. The are adorable together, yet you struggle to decide whether how well you would have accepted them as one of their 12-year-old peers.<br /><br />Some of the adults are very reserved like these lead children, while others of the adults are essentially the opposite, letting emotions completely run amok while they try to corral the behaviour of the adolescent scouts.<br /><br />The 1965 vibe is great. Being born in the 1970s, my feelings aren't exactly nostalgia, but I feel like I'm watching a dramatization of the old family photo albums I flipped through as a kid. The costumes are so much fun, ie: the foster father who has a phone to match his house which matches his pants. It seems like everything in this world is tinted with the green, brown and orange hues all those old photos have.<br /><br />We enjoy a lot of movies because they are about huge disasters or massive criminal plots -- big stuff. I would argue that the transition into adolescence is about as big as it gets for most of us, and certainly something that I can identify with. I really liked this film and would recommend it to most people.<br /><br />I think it suits certain tastes. My wife thought it was fine, but she knew that it was the sort of thing that I love -- a character story chock-full of quirky people and quotable dialogue.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|A bit slow to start but a very interesting and moving story.So Glad I read it before watching the movie
B004WR125O|5.0|in this new wireless world this product is a necessary add on for the onkyo audio video receiver to access the internet
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Many hours of free fun- hack and slash to your heart's delight. Upgrading weapon is top priority. Don't forget to stack your resistances. Secret- you can build rage back up getting hit, and if defense and resistances above the hits coming at that level you won't lose any life. So if defense enough can even stand on spikes and slowly get rage back.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Case is well constructed and the auto shutoff feature when you close it is nice for my teen.  The one problem is that it does not stand as well as described.  The description said the non-slip surface will let you stand and angle at many positions but my son's case slides if he doesn't put it pretty much upright.  Not a huge deal because he can still stand it up.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Hard to put down and unpredictable; there will definitely be a sequel! I highly recommend it as an easy read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait until book six is released. I will just have to be happy with watching season three til then. A very quick read for a thousand page book.
B0090SI44M|4.0|I love this movie from Pixar, I Dvr'ed it when it was on tv and I found myself watching it every other day, it's really funny. I was thrilled when disney re-released it on blu-ray dvd.  **The only reason I gave this review four out of five stars is because I'm unsure if the standard dvd includes the Short Film 'Partysauras Rex' This is my only gripe with disney, If you include bonus features on just one format it leaves out Others who don't own a blu-ray player.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love love love love it! Amazing novel! Didn't think it would be this way but i loved the ending !
B001EC3JME|5.0|My husband has been using this for close to a year now and has had no issues. It was definatley worth the price we paid.

B00999DFP0|5.0|I bought these for my wife for a Christmas present. She loves them. This show is so funny it just cracks her up. Thank You.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great game if you love puzzles. I have not had any issues so far? So If you love puzzles this app is for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Like it its a must buy and addicting. Not as good as computor or xbox edition yet good price is ok too
B003VANOFY|5.0|They are amazing.  The specs they provide are accurate.  They have good wireless range and the 7.1 surround sound is crystal clear.  They are solid all around great headset.  Any thing better you're going to be looking at spending 200+.  But for the 99.98 price I got them for.  These things will last me for a LONG time to come.
0307950689|2.0|I love the topics Dan Brown chooses.  The DaVinci Code is a classic; Angels & Demons is very entertaining.  The Lost Symbol is a failure.  This book bombs compared to what he does with content and plot in his other books.  Very disappointing.
B00280LYHS|5.0|AMAZING ACTION THAT FLOWS, IS SHOCKING, AND EMOTIONAL. BEST ENDING EVER. AMAZING,SPECTACULAR,SHOCKING,STUNNING, ARE THE WORDS I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS BOOK.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Bravo to Markus Zusak. The central character of this novel is a young girl, raised by German step-parents, during the period of Nazi Germany.  The book brings a rich perspective on what it means to be human, including the power of words and language. So many novels today are empty, pale imitations of what has come before.  This one speaks to the human heart. Though it  tells of terrible things, it is a work of inspiration and feeling.
0345803485|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like the series, but figured there was so much hype about it that i just had too. Sooooo...glad i did. Love this series.  Sad that I've read all the books. Definitely a series I will re-read over and over. I think its a great love story with alot of twists that keep you wanting to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great. You connect the colored dots without touching without touching other lines or pipes. It's fun and gets more and more complicated as you go along. Great game, and free too.
0345803493|5.0|Love this series.  Couldn't stop reading - ended up reading the entire series within a week and a half.  I would suggest anyone read the series - male or female. Really is a sweet love story with some twists.
030758836X|1.0|Seriously???  That story line was completely imposable far out reaching. What a complete waste of my time and energy. Ridiculous!!!
0345803507|5.0|Great read.  Couldn't stop reading Book kept me interested - I found myself wanting to find out what happened next, the next thing I knew, it would be 2 o'clock in the morning. Great love story with a twist.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Excelente sonido recomendado, no cansan los oidos, un sonido plano muy bueno para la mezcla, excelente dise&ntilde;o y precio, los recomiendo sin duda.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Love the Twilight Series.  Wanted to watch Part 1 again before Part 2 came out in the theaters.  Great movie!
B008MF3OEY|5.0|This cover feels even better than I had expected after reading other reviews.  I didn't have any trouble fitting my kindle fire into the elastic .  It fits snuggly and I don't worry about it slipping out.  I will probably use a snapping cover when traveling, but this beautiful cover is perfect for home use.  It looks like a book when closed.
1439108277|5.0|I have always been interested in physics and this book helped me see the world in a different way... a physics way the book is very educational and isnt just for people who know about physics this book can help you learn about the subject. Walter Lewin is an amazing writer!!!
145210655X|5.0|Perfect for any age! My son is 4yrs old and loves the book even thou not a starwars fan yet.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Tried this game out on a whim. And despite the frustration of constantly losing at first, it's one of my favorite games on my Kindle Fire now!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I fell in love with the first temple run and this version is even better! however, for some reason I can't open it from my kindle fire :(. it's such an addicting game and I really enjoy playing it whenever it opens!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Kept me interested and was both and action and romance series. The book was detail oriented to keep me more involved in the story.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Well.. There are many kinds of secrets.. Secret of history? Religion? Government? Secret of Majic? When I was about halfway through the book, It was all about the Law of Attraction but when I read the last half of the book, I came up with the very very secret. Most informative useful secret ever. Read to learn for yourself :)
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|have read this book - as well as the others in the series - at least 5 times.  love it every time.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Our 2 and 3 year old would watch this every day if we let them.  Cute story and keeps their attention well.  A movie mom and dad don't mind watching with them!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed the game, wished it was longer! They also could have put more spirits of<br />the people from the Jangada to make it  more interesting. Just my take. But great game in all! Have fun you all!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read Gone Girl and loved it so decided to read another book by Flynn. Twisted, somewhat predictable, but intriguing. I had gotten bored with it a fourth of the way through but glad I pushed through. Flynn has grown as an author since this book and will read more by her.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose the rating because it was awesome.<br />I liked it because it was awesome<br />I would recommend this book to my friends
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|The trailer looks great. The movie itself, however, is far better. Outstanding character profile by Denzel Washington. Lots of surprises and subtle humor.
B00772M1F6|5.0|I bought this after listening to samples on Amazon and OMG...it became one of my faves. I love every song on it. Northside Gal, Firebug, Dimes for Nickles are my favorite tunes. I looked up J.D. after seeing that he was playing locally and fell in love. I got a group together to see him in person and he and the band did not disappoint. &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Ok ,watched this one a month ago- had no opinion since the movie was so-so. Have seen all the films in this franchise and it seriously needs rebooting. Better than the last one but not as good as others. The plot makes little sense and seems only to serve a way for Milla to be constantly shooting things. The best thing to do is start over and go back to the source material of the biohazard games. Meisa Kuroki or Yumiko Shaku as the heroine and zombies for the threat, tired of silly super monsters. Not sure but have heard studio planning a sixth film before laying it to rest.
B000002AGN|5.0|Brubeck, especially this work, is one of my top favorites in jazz. He's tied for first place with Miles Davis &#34;Kind of Blue&#34; and in my same category containing W. Marsalis and Diana Krall (before Costello reared his ugly head, that is.)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|pretty cool me and my 3yr old love it the only thing that's a pain is having to have gems for allot of stuff
B001IF277K|5.0|Works great. Absolutely no problems with it. I recieved it a little bit sloe through the mail but that is only because I normally get my orders preety quick.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|All the songs are 3 stars or above.<br />No need to talk about Its time; it is all over the radio. However, I rate it 4 stars.  Bleeding out, radioactive, top of the world, and tip toe are 5 stars. Rest of them are beautiful songs also.  If you buy the album from Amazon, don't forget to get the tracks, working man, and Falling from the iTunes.
B006GLMHBM|3.0|Why are we rating this show? It is the first season, thats about it. You get this season and it is what it is. My wife loves it, I don't get it, whatever.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I really don't know what to rate about it.  The old one wore out and I needed a new one.  This one arrived on time and it works!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Got this game for my lil girls and caught up in it myself. Great game if I do say so. I'd tell anyone to get this game.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I have read &#34;A Dog's Purpose&#34; and &#34;A Dogs Journey&#34; before reading this.<br /><br />The story was nice and the comparisons to racing were also interesting as well as educational to me.  I picked the book up thinking it was similar to purpose/journey but its not.  Yes its told from the eyes of a dog but the real story is the family and their troubles.  The dog is there providing what dogs do best companionship.  It was interesting to hear what the dog thought, but honestly the first person could have been anyone.<br /><br />It still was a good book, not 5 star to me, but still a very enjoyable read and worth the money.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I chose this rating because I was fully absorbed in this book. The words were beautifully written and it reminded me of how society hasn't really changed. K
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|This is a great love story and musical. I have never seen the actual opera, but this is wonderful. The music is so beautiful and the actors are fantastic. Gerard Butler is so good in this role, it was hard to believe he did his own singing. Love this movie.
B005ILYW1E|5.0|this was a great movie and i enjoyed every minute of it and would like to keep it to watch it later
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Had to un install and then reinstall for sk4. Seems amazon stop doing updates<br />Oh well. Seems I also can't submit
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|this was a great movie and i enjoyed every minute of it and would like to keep it to watch it later
B007J4T2G8|5.0|To the crap reviewers. thank you. It was more entertaining reading how bad the book was then it would have been to have read a bad book. Thx for saving me the agony. blurred vision & $$$. I am that many more days younger than to have wasted my time getting old with a crap read :)
B009HEJXFS|5.0|this was a great movie and i enjoyed every minute of it and would like to keep it to watch it later
B000002GW5|1.0|Well, this was a used CD, for 0.36, however I only ordered it for the song Stay, with the outstanding backup vocals. The CD lists 10 tracks, the last one being Stay. Guess what was not on the CD. It had 9 tracks. Not worth returning it, but what a con.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|this was a great movie and i enjoyed every minute of it and would like to keep it to watch it later
B005NNUKF4|2.0|The MP3 version I bought has some gapes in the music where it stops completely then continues...If I could get my money back or a credit that would be greatly appreciated...If not I will seriously re-think buying music from Amazon anymore...John Lepore
B003K07DUC|5.0|this was a great movie and i enjoyed every minute of it and would like to keep it to watch it later
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I enjoy listening to him sing,  I enjoyed watching him on American Idol.. My favorite song is Home  on this CD.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a funny and good book!!!!! I loved it! Greg has to impress a girl  when he takes her to the dance. I suggest this book
0671646788|5.0|this book is very informative and motivating, the information it provides will be vital to my personal success and development.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesome that you can wonder around the level and the sick weapons you can buy all the the armor you can buy is really awesome
B008602KQI|2.0|Just finished reading the Hunger Games and am halfway through Catching Fire. First off, the book was ok. The storyline is interesting but left me wanting for more. Now for the movie. I've read lots of reviews that say the movie was close to the book. Wow, not sure what book they are comparing it too as the movie did not follow many of the stories described in the book. The movie does not develop the \\"relationship\\" with Gale.  The death of Rue, followed by the district 12 three finger salute (which would never have been aired by the Capitol) and the revolt/uprising in the movie do not follow the book. The movie makes it look like District 11 revolts,  but it's actually District 8 that revolts. There are too many inconsistencies for an ok book that makes the movie not enjoyable. I would recommend not reading the book as this might not bias you opinion of the movie. Glad I watched this as a rental.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|5 STARS<br /><br />I thought that the book was silly, funny and very cute!!<br /><br />And also, I'm only ten years old.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game. If you a fast swiped you will be good at the game. I love the game.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It only took a day to read, but that is because it is one of those books you can't put down. The tone is light, making the content and heavy pith a pleasure to take on. Worth reading for it's happy and heavy moments. A real pleasure. Every book should be narrated by a soon-to-be human canine.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|This is the very first arcade game I played (Atari) and have been hooked<br />on it since. It really helps me keep my reflexes up to par (can be nerve racking<br />too) at times.  :-)
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is a nice looking watch for the money.<br />My only issue is, the strap has some finish issues where the nylon was not neatly aligned when it was doubled over and stitched together.  This wasn't an issue for me as I replaced the strap immediately.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I areally get a kick out of playing this game...and no...I am<br />not a child, I am an adult. Angry Birds is the best.
0812982622|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Was fast, easy to read, but hard to take sometimes (not Kite Runner hard, just shocking). I sometimes felt it was sci fi, or dystopian futuristic, but apparently this is North Korea. Fascinating.
B00063F8B2|3.0|Nice CD, but not a favorite. Would not recommend it if you have not seen the movie. Many of the songs would not be meaningful if you could not connect them to the movie.
0345803493|5.0|It came in good condition! Can't wait to read the next one. :) I am totally hooked. I am glad I got it for this price. Thank you.
1452110581|5.0|I love cats and this was a perfect present to my brother. Looks new and there are no defects. Thanks
1444710338|4.0|I liked the concept enough to try it. I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because, I have a few questions that were not answered. one for example is, &#34;can I have chicken broth while on the diet ?&#34; If you read the book, you will know why I asked this question. The broth opens up many possibilities on food preparation. Overall, it had enough info to try it on your own without signing up for their coaching staff online, which was pricey. Good Luck !
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I haven't read many books where the Amish are the focus. The story was complex enough to hold my attention but not unfathomable. You may find yourself surprised by the ending.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|A very good start to a story.  I am left with several questions. The most important of which: \\"When does the next book come out?\\"
076115678X|4.0|This book is a must have for curly girls wanting to tame frizz, moisturize curls and embrace the natural, God-given hair that grows out of your own head. I recieved this book quickly, even before I expected!  Would definately order from this seller again.
030758836X|1.0|It started out OK but by the time I finished it, I was sorry I ever read it.  It seemed to go on forever -<br />too wordy. It wasn't my type of book as I don't like depressing or mentally sick stories.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and took it over. Now one of my favorite games!<br />I recommend for parents and children. This game is fun and challenging.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Like every nerd dreamed about for 2 years, Joss Whedon’s science-fiction TV series, Firefly (2002), finally has a conclusion. Serenity (2005) is the final chapter of the cult classic series with a slightly revamped graphics and answers that the series never gave. It finally concludes the cliff hanger ending left for watchers of the series without starting additional seasons. One may think that they won’t understand the movie at all if they haven’t seen Firefly, but this is not so. The movie is a great standalone film as well as an addition to the series. Serenity it is a great film because of its unique acting, Wild West-like, futuristic universe, the thought provoking content, and well-designed science fiction essences.<br /> The viewer is thrown into a science lab with advanced technology and human experimentation. Here the viewer meets the first two members of the crew, River Tam, a genetically superior girl, and her brother Simon, the crew’s doctor. After their daring escape the viewer finds  the rest of the crew on their Firefly class transport ship named the Serenity. In addition to River and Simon, the crew run by Captain Malcolm Reynolds includes a mechanic, a pilot, the captain’s first mate, and a gun slinging mercenary, all characters well known to fans of the series. To fans of the series, it is pleasant to see all of the same characters as were in Firefly, but disappointingly it has all of the same characters as Firefly. Certain actor performances are not as well done as one would hope. However, it could as be said that these almost outlandish actor portrayal represent the eccentric, futuristic universe.<br /> Captain Mal and the crew arrive on the next city-like planet inhabited by large amounts of people with bright neon signs backed by depressing buildings and people. Not the bright, bubbly, utopian future as typically pictured. The viewer sees how the oppressive control that the Alliance’s empire has on the future worlds. It has the feelof the Star Wars universe with the line between good and evil much more difficult to define, which is different than many science fiction films.<br /> The science-fiction adventure can easily be compared to the Star Wars franchise and can easily be adored by those who love Star Wars. Han Solo fans specifically, will be instantly drawn to this movie and the main character Captain Malcolm Reynolds who owns a personality and style that is nearly identical to that of Han Solo’s. Serenity has a large amount of similarities within itself that make it comparable to Star Wars, but it is not a clone. This movie has its own story and universe different than that of Star Wars. It is original but is similar enough for Star Wars fans to delve into.<br /> For science-fiction fans or fans of the series Firefly, this is a must see. On the other hand, if you are a fan of neither, I would still suggest you give the movie a shot. Serenity brings great graphics, fun characters, an interesting perspective of the future, and makes one think about the moral decisions you make. Serenity puts your moral decision making to the test asking the question if small “good” decisions in the present day are correct or if “bad” decisions now are justifiable by the “good” outcomes.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm definitely hooked, can't count the number of hours I spend playing this game. Much better than solitaire. I love the hint feature when you get stuck
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a great finally of the series. Loved it!! It was good apron Suzanne's part. Hope it gets 5 stars all around

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|As always Clancy comes up with a story that is plausable, suspensful and holds your interest right to the last line.  Recent news reports make this story very much in line with today's world.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bruno's attempt to become a major player in the Pop-Music pool results in a step back in originality.<br />It still has a distinct sound, but misses the smile inducing groove-ability of his previous work.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|The movie was fun.  Daniel Craig does not measure up to Sean Connery as James Bond.  The sound was terrible.  We could hardly understand a word that was being said.
080701429X|5.0|Price was good, received it quicker than stated and it was a good book to boot!  It was a good experience.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have been a sucker for Corey novels for years. This one did not disappoint.<br />I will stick by DeMille as long as he is writing.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who just loves the scary guy in this movie...he scared me too!  It was a good experience!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good mix of memory, logic, object find and a fun story. free part definatley kept u wanting more. will look for more of these
0061537969|5.0|What a great story told from the perspective of Enzo.  No spoiler alerts here, but this book does not disappoint. One of the few that I could read again and still be engulfed in the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great writing!  A lot of violence but I couldn't put the &#34;book&#34; down anyway.  I read all three and was hoping for a fourth one.
B000W44IZW|5.0|Love this movie. It is funny and yet serious. Beautiful cinematography. I fell in love with all the characters, including the mermaids.  What a love story!
B004KKX80A|5.0|Don't really get it but one of my teenagers thinks this thing is pretty cool.  Go figure.  Whatever it takes to fill up space
B004LM72ZY|5.0|My son has not put this toy down since we received it!<br />And when he wakes up the first thing he says is &#34;Rocketship! where's my rocket?&#34;
0307200477|4.0|This is a fantastic book.  My only complaint, and I'll put it first here, is the very strong smell with the extra page - the 'flowers' smell like a very powdery very old lady. After the book aired for a couple weeks, it wasn't so bad, and we skip that page when reading the book.  My little one LOVED that he could touch and turn the pages - and found the book to be quite engaging :)
0345803493|5.0|Good read, however not as good as the first book.<br />The book dragged on and on for me. However it is a must read!!!
B001676320|2.0|This wasn't really an on night for either group.Seemed disjointed and some very off key moments. Love both bands, just not this night.
0345803485|5.0|What a book!!! I love this book so much. This book got<br />me reading again. I haven't read a book from cover to cover<br />since ???? well never. There was always some kid I could<br />copy off or get notes from... What a book!!!! Whoo-Hooo!!!
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|I liked The Sessions, but doubt that an average audience would like it because of the subject matter.  I particularly liked the fact that such a sensitive issue was dealt with realistically without shame or guilt being imposed on the protagonists.  I also liked the fact that a priest was cast as a real person who understood the nature of man and God and didn't separate one from the other.  Holly Hunt was exceptional in her role as a sex therapist!
0767802519|5.0|I did give the dvd a 5 star, only because I've seen it before.<br />I received the dvd broken, and disappointment set in. However the<br />shipper refunded my money in a timely manner. I'll try again
B007BFSYMS|5.0|When I originally got this as the FAOTD, I only saw the basics. One sound at a time, have to force close, on constantly. But since I have used it a few times, I realize those are all wrong. There is a quit button in the menu. It does play in the background, but you can pause it or shut it off if you don't want it in the background. And I found you can mix sounds by looking at the list of all the sounds instead of just scrolling through. You also have the option of downloading new sounds when they put them up at no charge. I got it free, but I would definitely say it is worth the 1.99.
0345803507|5.0|Love, Love, Love it!!! Book was received in excellent condition.<br />E L James is Fantastic! Love Love Love It! Thanks
B008MF3OEY|5.0|I just received this and it is as beautifull as I expected.  I am a retired book publisher and the binding resembles and feels like a very special leather-bound book.  I do wish it had a holder/inside sleeve for the stylus/pointer I use.  But most of these Kindle Fire holders don't.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|THIS IS FRICKING AMAZING<br />I absolutely love this book I will consider this my favorite book this had a great combination everything that makes a book great
B006ZZC3D6|1.0|It was fun on my iPod. But it won't even download. Also I an and that even with paying I got 1 or 2 ads!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|the premis is so outside the box and this story is not cluttered with stray side stories. a great read, hard to put down..
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is one of my favorite of all time civil war movie. I appreciate all of the work that went into making this film. The number of re-enactors that were needed to bring this picture to life was simply outstanding. Tom Berenger,  who portrayed Joshua  Chamberlain, did an amazing job this character. This movie brings out the horror of what the civil war was about and runs true to Michael Shaara's novel &#34;The Killer Angels&#34;.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|The movie provides good entertainment.  I have to wonder if they really visited some of the locations portrayed or used computer &#34;magic&#34; for some of the scenes?
0345803485|5.0|I have not finished the book yet, but so far it is interesting , and yes I would recommend this book
1567184855|5.0|The enjoyment and information you get from this book depend a lot upon how much knowledge of the technique and/or credence you place in what people disclose during hypnosis.  If you find the methods used to obtain the material credible, you will find much thought provoking material in this book.  I find it fascinating and informative.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This story is great. Jamie is a Great author. Can't wait to be able to read more of her books  very soon.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|The movie provokes thoughts on relationship that can serve to help all of us.  I think seeing situations portrayed which are not really that uncommon can help us see the normality in our lives, accept ourselves where we are at the moment and work on what we are to improve our lives.
B003YBUSMW|5.0|I was looking for a replacement for my steering wheel that was blown off during my 196 mph collision with an ice cream truck (I was distracted by all of the chickens locked in the coup in the back seat) and this is a much cheaper option than the real wheel the mechanic tried to install. Interesting note, with the right wiring the Xbox buttons can work your radio and bluetooth connection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is fun servile is my best load it is more fun that is the best game I have on my kindle
B00899F0G8|5.0|Worth it! My longest going tv addiction. A true murder mystery. If you dont get ABC family you have to watch this on amazone.com!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It is the best! Sucks for the people who said it was one star. It is the best portable piano ever! :):):)
1439152802|1.0|My dear friend gave me this book at Christmas time and I was so eager to read it.  I must tell you I do not start a book and then not finish it.  BUT.......I did not finish this book.  Maybe I have missed something interesting but it did not hold my interest and I thought it was confusing. Disappointed me and especially when the lady at the book store raved about it.
B0031R5K68|5.0|As always this author keeps you on e edge of your seat and the ending what a twist loved every word

B000053ZRR|5.0|You want to rock....watch this concert! Awsome! music is so great! Even though it rained on the people attending the concert...did not stop 50,000 people  from attending this concert...You will love it!!!!!
B008J1QFLU|5.0|This is a very classy package. Of course, this cycle is one of Decca's classic recordings and has seen a number of releases. Any fan of these opera's will already own at least one of them. Yes, it's an expensive set, but when you add up all you get, it seems worth it. And it does sound better than the first CD releases.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Rated this a 5....Jon and his band are outstanding. I recommend that if you are a Bon Jovi fan. Get this concert. You will play it over and over. Great songs great performance by all the band. Especially Jon. WOW!!!! Buy it
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Installed on my Samsung GS3. Great UI, tons of useful info, well designed. I use this app all of the time to track my power use during the day.
B0001AP158|5.0|This DVD will rock you. He sings all his songs in a slow romantic melody that will have you drooling!!!!!! You can hear and undersand his words and have his face up close and personal all throught the concert.....Just Great!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I LOVED this book about a father's unfaltering, but unguided love for his son.  And the ending - WOW!<br />By far his best yet
B0041CGOZS|5.0|What can I say. In love with this guy and his band...anything he does or plays is the best. His movies are great also.
B00A655N8I|5.0|Technical issues: these CDs had fingerprints on them, plus one disc was scratched badly enough to cause skipping.  I'm wondering if Amazon sent me a used copy?  Otherwise, the CD sound (I haven't heard the SACD sound) is terrific, clear and transparent, full and exciting.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I really liked Gergiev's expansive, involved conducting.  Reminded me of both Solti and Von Karajan at times.  Nothing felt over-driven and the playing is clarity itself, but I'll admit there are unusual choices of tempi here and there, usually on the slow side.  But the bottom never falls out, and the sheer gorgeousness of the music is paramount.  The orchestra plays very well indeed and the performance works very well.<br /><br />The cast is decent to great.  Jonas Kaufmann is superb, everything one could want in a Siegmund: beautiful, exciting singing and excellent musicianship - a thrilling performance.  Nina Stemme is a very fine Brunnhilde.  (She's no Nilsson, but who is?)  She manages nice trills for War Cry, and sings with warm, feminine (if sometimes thick) tone.  She is especially magnificent in the last act, very moving. She reminds me somewhat of Astrid Varnay.<br /><br />Rene Pape is vocally just my kind of Wotan.  His top is secure and the dark solid lower voice is exactly what I want to hear in this role.  It really anchors the music.  Here is a great, intelligent  singer caught at his vocal peak.  He never blusters.  Wotan's Monologue is riveting and his long scene with Brunnhilde at the end is really splendid, a truly great performance from both of them..  It is so well sustained (with some pretty broad tempi) that I hung on their every word and was genuinely moved by it in a way I rarely have been.  Surely this is the most sheerly beautiful final scene of WALKUERE on record.<br /><br />Anja Kampe is a decent Sieglinde, though she won't efface memories of the past.  I heard a few suspect pitches.  A very nice, expansive &#34;O hehrstes wunder&#34; is followed in the next line by an ungainly yelp, which should have been redone. Similarly Ekaterina Gubanova is a good Fricka: she hectors very well and the voice is an attractive one.  She knows what's she's doing and makes no ugly sounds.  Mikhail Petrenko is a more-than-acceptable Hunding, perhaps too lovely of voice.  The Valkyries are an uneven bunch and a bit on the squally side at times, sad to say.  I've heard better.<br /><br />Sonically, this is probably the best WALKUERE available.  Its clarity is stunning, and I regret I don't own an SACD player.  I may have to get one just for this. This is really a wonderful recording, overall.  If I prefer a few of the older versions, put it down to my age and Birgit Nilsson.rstes wunder&#34; is followed in the next line by an ungainly yelp, which should have been redone.

B002MAQSC0|5.0|I like it .and I think this good and useful.And i find it online by myself .really really really good
B005LAII62|4.0|Supposed to be a kids movie right? As an adult I found this movie a little scary and intense. It was humorous also but a bit much for the younger sect. My son is 7 and it was on the cusp of being too much for him,if I had known I probably would have not allowed him to watch it. It's fine for older kids,other than the paranormal there is scenes of bullying. Good movie just not for the little ones. Think Monster House scary.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app should be rated 5 stars because my daughter loves it.<br />She thinks that this is the best app ever!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It is a good read and funny at the same time kinda reminds me of fifty shades of gray but cleaner
B008L1F91A|5.0|I have been a comic book fan since the early 90s but never bougth any collectable figures.  Maybe a few cheap action figures but nothing collectable quality.  Great price and beautiful quality.  I also bought the Green Lantern and will continue with the full set.  I have recommend these to several friends already.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Tried the free app enjoyed it so much I downloaded the full version. Love the various aspects hidden in the game.
B000002G89|5.0|Este CD é composto por músicas de extrema qualidade e bom gosto. São excelentes composições tocadas por músicos de primeira qualidade. É indispensável para quem gosta de Eric Clapton.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is good but I wish they had different. obsticles and routes but it is in my top five games
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|This movie is over the top, not in a bad Stallone-arm-wrestling way, but in a good i'm-gonna-throw-a-spear-and-slice-a-piece-of-my-enemy's-face-off kind of way. This movie is like red-meat to movie carnivores like me who are looking for inspiring stories of extraordinary people facing incredible odds and who spit in the face of those who doubt their abilities.<br /><br />Anyway, there is some cheesy dialogue and gratuitous nudity and violence --but then again this is Zack Snyder we're talking about. The Blu Ray itself is great, good picture quality --you haven't seen CGI blood spatter until you've seen it in 1080p.
B009FREK3W|4.0|Was this necessary? Probably not. Is it an interesting album worth buying? Yes, for Jeff Lynne fans and maybe new ELO fans. Old-school, die-hard ELO fans (I would define as those who, for example, know who Roy Wood, Bev Bevans, and Richard Tandy are) might not cotton to these re-makes. I am more of a Jeff Lynne fan than ELO fan so these newer versions didn't lessen the greatness of the original tracks, at least for me.<br /><br />Even when re-making his old tracks, Jeff Lynne doesn't fail to impress. Being an ELO fan I could not resist doing an iTunes Playlist where I could listen to each track back to back with it's original counterpart. It was remarkable how similar they were and the newer tracks do sound &#34;cleaner&#34; than their original counterparts for obvious reasons. There were a few times where I felt like the newer versions didn't quite have the same &#34;charm&#34; as the originals, but overall Jeff did a fantastic job re-making these songs. The new one &#34;Point Of No Return&#34; is nifty as well.<br /><br />Now I am ready for some NEW Jeff Lynne material!!
B004DTLK62|3.0|First of all, what a great RDJ performance. He WAS Chaplin. It was such a shame the movie itself is such a mixed bag. I am sure it was difficult to tell a life story in such a limited amount of time and Sir Attenborough did the best job he could do I suppose.<br /><br />The Blu Ray transfer looked fine to me. Features were not that impressive. Some interviews, none with RDJ, and I was pleasantly surprised that Sir Attenborough acknowledged the films failings and said he wished he could do it again!
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I have generally been impressed with the materials and construction used in products of the Amazon Basics line. With this item I am too, but I don't care for its design. It is unwieldy, ungainly. Although providing a 'foot' on which to set the case shows some thought re function, the semi-hard foot adds an awkward appearance. The thing doesn't actually add an inch to the case as it first seems, because the interior space extends downward into it, and contains appropriate padding. I'd say function first, form second, and for some DSLRs this may be needed, but the thing is simply a huge lumpkin. The exterior measurements are 9 1/8\\" tall, 7 1/4\\" wide and 7\\" deep at its largest points. I realize these measurements are not the same as those given in the product description, but that's what I got.<br /><br />I do like the pockets on three sides, the soft carry handle on top, the three-sided top zipper, the repositionable interior dividers and the nice strap that clips onto the exterior D rings. But I think the mesh on the fourth side is a bit silly - it looks as though it is meant to mimic the backpacking panels that are supposed to breathe when a pack is worn against the body, but I can't see how this actually functions; rather it appears to be sort of a design fraud, especially since I can't imagine actually carrying this thing while walking. But I think it can be a good home or vehicle protector of delicate electronics, I just haven't decided what. Like a lot of things around here, it will inevitably become valuable as the perfect inhabitant will be found. It just might not be a DSLR, though.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Great movie, even for older people but the movie stopped with 32 minutes left to watch and couldn't be started again.  We have written a separate email asking for help.  We don't know what the outcome will be.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|This was a good read and I recommend it to those who enjoy the Bronte sister's work. I gave it 4 stars because although it is a good story, I found the characters themselves frustrating. This book is not meant to be skimmed for the character names overlap and it can become confusing if not paying attention. Also, I found it hard to relate to since we do not marry our cousins nowadays. That being said there are parts of this book I enjoyed immensely and there are some great romantic quotes.
B003719G40|5.0|Wonderful book, I have finally found my and my fiances love language.  Our pastor recommended this book for us before we got married.  Priceless knowledge obtained.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book so much. I read it much later than everyone else, but I couldn't put it down. <3
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book is quite beautiful. It isn't hard to get into and out has a great ending. I loved how it was written in later formed. It was however a little inappropriate. they spoke, drink alcohol, have sex, rape, and do drugs. other than that i believe it is my favourite book of all time. A+
B005EWDA3I|4.0|Like no other author, Murakami lets the readers take part in making the histories themselves. 1Q84 is no exception. What could be described as loose ends is transformed into issues open to free interpretation in Murakamis universe(s). Though sometimes a little long, book 3 sums it all up and delivers the ending to 1Q84 as it has to be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My child loves taking care of her horse Hazel. She'd really like a real horse, and I think it will not be trouble to buy her one. Great, real but virtual horse. Also great to take care of. Recommended app. Not sure if it works on kindle
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love Rick Riordan's writing!!! I've read the series over and over, not just the Percy Jackson series but Kane chronicles also. Whenever a new book comes out I re-read the series all over again. Just can't get enough.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fun read with modern writing, but with an ending that comes off a little dubious.  Well worth it, though.
B009FZFONO|5.0|From the first season until now i am absolutely sucked in. The spectrum of different types of people in the show really intrigue me when zombies are not getting slaughtered. There is not much to say about this show except to watch it. I haven't found an episode I haven't liked. Good stuff, looking forward to following the series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's simply the best mobile game ever made. As with the original, every aspect of the game is highly polished and it is uniquely fun to play as a result. TR2 improves on many features of its predecessor and adds a ton of cool stuff as well. It will be the game you play most often from now on :-)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is not a review of the quality of product, (it was a kindle edition, so nothing wrong) but more of a quick review of the book content.<br /><br />I hate Suzanne Collins for this. T_T Everytime I like a character, THEY END UP DEAD. Its so annoying, and just in general, I didnt think that this last one was as good as the first two, but thats just my opinion.  The ending felt a bit rushed.  But still, I love the series.  (Johanna is my soul mate. lmao)
0061537934|5.0|This book has a good story attached to it. My daughter gave me The Art of Racing to read a few years ago. I never read it , and  gave to the public library after cleaning out some of my bookcases. My daughter was upset when she found out, I did not read it and, I gave it away. So, I bought it on Amazon and read it. I couldn't put the book down. It brought me joy and made me cry, all at the same time. The main character Enzo, was reminiscent of our own dog that has been gone for years now. The story warmed my heart, and reminded me of how much our pets are a  part of our family. This book will always be on my bookshelf.
B008220C56|3.0|If you watch this movie and then watch the 1948 version with Vivian Leigh, they are the same screenplay. This was a beautiful costume movie, the acting extremely well done, but the presentation strange and at times disturbing. I expected more from Joe Wright as I loved Pride and Prejudice and Atonement. Yes, I painstakingly read Tolstoy's book when I was younger with all of the Russian lineage twisting in my head. This time it was a different painstaking mental experience with this movie making me feel as if I were at times in a twisted and confused mind with Anna Karenina. Sixteen years ago while in cancer treatment I would have bizarre, vivid dreams that played out at night and during the days while so very sick I felt I was viewing life as a stage, everyone else performing while I was stuck. Maybe that is what Joe Wright wanted us to feel, like Anna, but I did not find it entertaining. My suggestion is to rent the movie first before buying, if you are like me and am not a theater going person.<br /><br />Added later (3/12/13). Surprisingly, after a thorough discussion with my husband of 36 years who watched the movie with me, I discovered he enjoyed this movie! :)
1607885719|5.0|Great book, I bought the CDs to listen to whilst on my lengthy drives back and forth to work.  As all Baldacci books it was great.
B00447G29S|5.0|This is a great movie, but need to see it on a 3D it is awesome!! kids love the actions and how it makes them feel they were there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I like how theres a jackpot its a game for the books boss awesome great style
B007712XAU|5.0|I loved this! It was so much fun to watch and learn! It was amazing to see how people lived at the turn of the century!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series! I have watched it over and over! I can't wait for season 4! Hurry up, your public awaits!
B004N66XYE|3.0|This was average in entertainment. If you like Downton Abbey, this is a similiar, but less exciting. I wasn't that impressed with it.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|I had season one, so I wanted season two. Opened package to find disc one had a crack starting at the center hole. I was able to watch it, but I'm not sure how many times.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is good.bit it frezes.a lot and.I could be better but I truly think temple run 2 is much more fun and I enjoy playing temple run 2 than subway servers
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has held me captive since last Sunday. Even though I saw the movie it was great. Now I'll move on to the next in the series.
B007704HO6|5.0|I sooo enjoyed this book.  I am a cat lover and even I was in awe of this amazing cat.  I have since been on the net and seen it. Wow what a story, what a cat !!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok like sub way surfer is is very good and I think the next game of subway surfer two is even going to be better
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is so unbelievably fast. I was texting my friend from Ohio and it sent the message to her super fast. I highly recommend this app for huge texters! I was texting my brother as soon as as i typed it and sent it, it went to him right away!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Works exactly as I thought. The over quality is good so I think will last enough for the price. I recommend this product.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent acting combined with consistent high quality script writing make for a &#34;look forward to the next episode&#34; series.  Period makeup and sets along with support equipment (wonderful autos, carriages, etc,) provide realism.  Highly recommended.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey takes soap opera to a new high, comparable to the classic novels, full of complex characters, good and evil.  The acting is nothing short of superb and the sets and costume are so realistic as to transport one back in time.  I can hardly wait for each night when I allow myself the pleasure to sit and watch a new episode.  This is a series one wishes would never end.
1439153663|5.0|You will feel like you're a part of the past while reading Kathleen Grissom's story of Lavinia as she grows from a 7-year old orphan to an adult with a 7-year old herself.  There is not a lot of happiness in this book, but it is so well-written that it's one of those books you just can't wait to get back to.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|If you've been keeping up with Downton Abbey, you must see this edition.  Extraordinarily beautiful with superb acting. Hugh Bonneville was the only choice for the master of the house and Maggie Smith is an absolute delight.  There have been many times when I have laughed out loud at some of her expressions.<br /><br />Get it, rent it, buy it, but watch it immediately.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Sure this game is sooooo adicting and fun and all that but there is a bad thing every once oin awhile it has a glitch and not just a little glitch A BIG GLITCH as i said every once in awhile it messes up and deletes ALL your progress EVERY THING  and it may not be a big dwal tp some people but for some one who has got limited characters and who has built up 70,000 coins and pver 75 hover bords then YEAH its a big deal so sure u can get this app but dont get too attached.
B005LAII12|3.0|“Ted” is “Family Guy” creator Seth MacFarlane’s feature-length, live-action comedy with bad language and raunchy jokes aplenty. But that is not a big surprise. Also, “Ted” can be very sentimental at times, but that is OK with me. The real problem of “Ted” is not that part.<br /><br />This is after all a one-joke movie, and the joke works most effectively in the opening section (narrated by Patrick Stewart) about how “Ted” is born. A lonely child named John Bennet makes a wish which comes true. His new teddy bear is alive! Now, 27 years later, the little boy grows up and becomes Mark Wahlberg, who has been dating Mila Kunis’s character Lori Collins. “Ted,” a teddy bear that walks and talks, becomes a foul-mouthed slacker stuffed toy.<br /><br />The rest of the film is, in short, “which does John choose, Lori or Ted?” The plotline is familiar and uneven, with lots of gags and pop culture references that are hit and miss. The film jumps from one comic set-piece to another without bothering to develop the characters, poking fun at pop culture icons including Flash Gordon and Taylor Lautner. OK, I laughed, I admit, but the idea of Giovanni Ribisi’s creepy stalker is not only unfunny; it is just out of place.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed the film by and large, I couldn’t help feeling that “Ted” could have been much better with a strong storyline and more fleshed-out characters.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|The premise of the game was very appealing to me.  The scientific and the costumes and such.  The only problem with the game was having some objects nearly out of sight.and hard to touch.
B005LAIGP0|1.0|\\"The Woman in Black\\" is a short (138 page) British novel written in 1982.  It attempts to recreate the classic Gothic ghost story from the 1800's and it succeeds wonderfully -- this is a hella scary book, steeped in Gothic atmosphere and slowly but deliberately paced.  Honestly, it will creep you out.  But somehow, this movie f***s it all up, despite being an otherwise well made flick.  I've read the book, twice, but even with that I couldn't follow the movie, as so much as been \\"re-imagined.\\"  And it's no longer a scary ghost story, just a muddled flick with some wanna-be scary graphics. Such a waste.
B001VNB54A|1.0|Please be sure to \\"test run\\" the Blu-Ray discs in your player ASAP when you receive them!  I received the same \\"The Pacific\\" Blu-Ray set for Christmas.  However, I did not try the discs out in my player right away.  I had expected everything to run OK (my bad).  When I was ready to watch The PACIFIC (on Feb 15), the discs WOULD NOT LOAD on my Blu-Ray player.  I then upgraded the firmware in my player... The discs still would NOT load.  So... I went out and bought a NEW Blu-Ray player which contained the latest and greatest firmware.  The discs now load ok - but after about 7-8 minutes of play - the discs stop as if the player is in perpetual \\"pause\\" mode.  I must then power my Blu-Ray player OFF and then ON again.  This happens over and over with every one of the discs.  Other Blu-Ray discs play just fine, and yes I have tested these defective discs in other Blu-Ray players with the same result - the screen freezes up after a few minutes of play.<br /><br />I attempted to return these for refund or exchange, however I discovered that I have exceeded the allowable time for returning.  So, I will toss my \\"The PACIFIC\\" discs away and live and learn....  That's why I'm posting this review.  Please TEST your discs as soon as you receive them.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I've had Temple run 1 for a while now and I was pretty good at it. Now that Temple run two has come out, I haven't stopped playing. Honestly, the first time I heard they were making a temple run 2, I was really confused what they would do to make it better. Now it has ropes, bridges, tunnels and mine cars. And now instead of three monkeys there's one huge monkey.<br />Overall I would recommend this game but the old one is going to seem so old fashion if you ever play it agian.<br />By the way, don't buy the coins with real money, it's a waste, you will play enough to get them on your own. :)
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The strength of the characters and the talent of the actors who played the different parts really made this movie entertaining.  It was worth renting!
B006LSZECO|4.0|the book was good, slow downed at times and i wish it ended different, but it was still worth the read.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Its pace is slower compared to previous books but there is a lot of background information for the characters. I personally enjoyed it but I can see how it can be boring for some.
B002SAS26E|1.0|I've played this game about 5 times now and I have to say that it isn't any fun. I don't understand how people can think that there are meaningful decisions in this game- they matter so little compared to sheer luck. Both winner and loser did not enjoy this game when  I've seen it played- it was just \\"oh you got better luck\\".<br />I strongly recommend looking at other games.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|The old man still has it. This cd rivals any cd or album that he has put out. It incorporates blues, rock, and country seamlessly. If you are a fan of Hiatt, you will not be unhappy with this cd. We're Alright now and You're All The Reason I Need are upbeat songs that seem to indicate that old John is doing well. His humor shows up in Blues Can't Even Find Me and Wood Chipper. This is just a well done cd that covers the many layers of music and song writing that John is capable of.

B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We saw this movie at the movie Theatre and my boys(3 and 5) LOVED it!!!  When they saw it on Amazon they were so excited so we bought it.  They have watched everyday for the last 4 days.  It is a great movie for the whole family and I think a good movie for both boys and girls.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|i enjoyed this book very much, as others have stated, there are some similarities to a certain movie that came out some years ago but the author puts the story together really well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thank you Amazon for having this season available for purchase. I watched the first two seasons on Netflix and combed the web for the first half of season 3 and you are the only place that had it!!

B00571F26Y|4.0|Quick and digestible (no pun intended) read with very important information that should be made readily available to the general public. Hopefully books like this will create the shift in the nutritional habits of the American people to save us from our ongoing health epidemic.
B006G2124E|5.0|Great book, great movie.  I don't like reading the book then seeing the movie.<br />Acting was great.<br />Content good.<br />Message clear.<br />Recommend for everyone.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and so did my husband and son. I will purchase it real soon to put in my library!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If the movie is ANYTHING like the book, it should win every category. I cannot imagine two more complex characters.  You root for them and at the same time wonder how you would interact with them if they were in your life.<br /><br />Anyone who either deals with mental illness whether directly or via a friend/family member will 'get it' and will want to see if our main characters get their happy ending/silver lining.
0385474547|4.0|Great book, great book, great book!!! All should read, very inspiring and opens up the realities about culture and beliefs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|I'm only giving this one two stars because it wasn't as exciting as I thought it'd be. I loved the first movie, and love the games, and what I assume they were trying to do was close out the first story. Unfortunatly it didn't work out that way. The acting wasn't that good, they cut alot of corners, and it seemed to me like the directer was trying to squeeze everything together to make a shorter movie. The story progression was so fast that it had a huge impact on my opinion of the characters. I love that people are taking an interest in this series and making more movies, but I sincerly hope that the next Silent Hill tries a little harder to make a movie worth watching.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash doesn't disappoint.  Great CD.  Very few times do I purchase CDs and like a majority of the songs.....but this is one of the few.
B008476HBM|4.0|Fun book to read employing an exciting play on words. I love the intelligent embedded satire relating to personal relationships among the characters in the book. Highly recommended.
B008KS4DR0|5.0|This movie was just so much fun, I tell everyone I know to watch it, whether they like horror movies or not. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are just hilarious. This really is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time.

B0073COMKW|5.0|We installed light bulb in our living area in a low hanging single globe light fixture (on long chain hanging over a table). The light out-put was quiet a bit better than expected. It gives a very nice bright (also wide angle) but warm light, We are very happy about the light quality.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Hearing her when she was younger was lovely.  she has such a fun personality.  very self depricating.  You will enjoy it.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I love her voice and her remarkable story.  She must be so happy to be able to sing for everyone.  where had she been hiding all these years?
B000HZD168|5.0|Kirk and Khan are at their melodramatic best, the early '80s special effects haven't aged too badly and the story and action are quite good.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love being able to watch the walking dead even if I missed it!  I get to wait until my family is home, dinner is done, baths are taken(yes I watch it with my kids), homework is done and we can relax and have family time watching the walking dead.
030758836X|4.0|When you read a who-done-it  do you...<br /><br />A) want to be able to be able to figure out the ending with your super-sleuth skills?<br /><br />B) want every loose end tied up in a Scooby-Doo-like conclusion?<br /><br />C) want to feel confident in placing your trust in the protagonist?<br /><br />D) want to be flung from one theory to another, challenged at every turn and left with much to decipher even after the story concludes?<br /><br />If you selected D, read the book.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Love watching these movies with my girls in the family room with all the lights off in the comforts of my own home for a lot less money than going to a crowded germy theartre.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is a great series. I couldn't stop watching it - I had a project due for a class I am taking and turned it in late because I could not stop watching the DVD.
B007URCTOG|5.0|I haven't ever had any problems downloading movies from amazon and love it.  The movie was good.  I enjoyed watching it with my girls.
0307887448|1.0|I wanted to like this book so badly.  It came highly recommended by both BoingBoing and The AV Club, and the concept is really intriguing.  Unfortunately, it's just a flat-out poorly written book.  After much debate, I bailed after about 70 pages.<br /><br />The book is written by a screenwriter, which unfortunately you can tell; all plot, no nuance.  The *idea* is interesting: a futuristic scavenger hunt of sorts.  It will inevitably make for a decent movie.  I even enjoyed the first chapter, which describes a short film.  But after that, the writing plods along, beating you over the head with the same superficial expository information.  Yes, we get it.  OASIS changed the culture.  Everybody fell back in love with the 80's.  Do we need to be reminded of this for 50 pages?<br /><br />I was going to tough it out and finish the book anyway, because I did still want to know what happens.  But around page 70 (spoiler alert?), after having established earlier in the book that the protagonist is too poor to get to some far away place, the protagonist suddenly *needs* to get to this far away place and conveniently remembers a way to get there for free.  The lazy writing actually pissed me off, and at that point, I gave up.<br /><br />As mild consolation, other AV Club readers seemed as puzzled by the glowing AV Club review as I was.  One commenter said it best: \\"It's the worst book I couldn't put down.\\"  Only I did put it down.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Love that I can watch a movie on my own time, in my own home, with whomever I want, whenever I want, over and over again.  And I don't even have to go to the store to get it!  I have never had any problems with any of the movies I have bought from amazon.  They are there immediately and I have never had a problem getting them to play.  I do it all the time now and will continue to do it as long as it is offered.  I also love the fact that these movies will never get lost, damaged, stolen, and I have them every where I go at any time!!!!
0062101897|5.0|This book is the ultimate for Harry Potter fans,  my daughter and I loved reading it and coming up with fascinating tidbits that we didnt know.  It is a book that will be on our coffee table for a long time.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|I bought this for 2 of my granddaughters and they play it every day in the car. Great gift idea.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|all the Chipmunk movies are worth getting in my opinon.  They are action packed and humorous.  My little boys absolutely love them.  Definately would reccomend to anyone.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austin.  Manners, observation, just beautiful.  They want fourteen more words about Jane.  But Jane is not about excess.  She is elegance itself.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Definitely easy reading and for free I suppose was ok read but thought the whole story a bit ridiculous to be honest.
B000OCXI3K|3.0|\\"Chocolat\\" is one of those books I read after seeing the movie several years ago.  As such, I knew the general premise of the story and major characters, but there were a few twists and of course more detail in the book.  This story hints at, but never really explains several things like the changing wind, whether Vianne is a witch, why she must always be moving, etc.  All of these elements come up in the story, but the reader is left to decide what it all means in relationship to Vianne, her past, her present, and her future.<br /><br />One part of the story is Vianne, and her dead mother's, fight against the church, which is portrayed as \\"The Black Man\\".  I think it is unfortunate that both of them seem to be constantly running into bad, hypocritical Christian examples, which seems to forever shut them off from any good a church might do.  While I don't agree with Vianne's life choices, I can understand her motivations.<br /><br />I don't recall a time frame for the book, but it seemed to be fairly modern due to the use of radios, mention of electric mixers, houseboats with engines, etc.; however, those elements seemed a bit out-of-place compared to the closed-minded nature of the people and priest Vianne encountered.  It seemed like the story would have worked better for me if it were set in a bygone era when folks weren't as receptive to an unwed mother.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book, and my mouth was watering as the author described so many yummy chocolate treats!  It was a fun story that bogged down at times in the middle, but a worthwhile read.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|So much fun for young &amp; old kids! Fun game to play when you need something to occupy time and very addictive.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Delivers what it says it will.  Certainly chows down on power, but the performance is excellent within  10 feet, I notice it starts to cut out after that or if you happen to have it in your pocket and you get more than an arms length away.  I use it with my JBL portable and it really does perform well.  Hope it works just as well with bluetooth enable headphones...would be a great asset for biking.  Probably need an extra power source for much longer than 4 hours.
B004BA5FDC|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read on the power of thought on effecting the circumstances of your life
B0060I0IG2|3.0|In this review I am going to concentrate on the recording of these Beethovan works. I need to spend more time listening and researching why Maestro Chailly was so fixated on tempi. I have listened to the You Tube interviews and have gained some understanding of the basis for his decision. My overall initial reaction is that his approach is different but I still am positive about the purchase for that reason.  I must say however, that the purchase is not so positive when it comes to the quality of the recording. And this is especially true as the set was recorded by Decca one of the finest recording companies past and present. I am sorry to say but it appears that stereophonic sound is coming to an end if this set represents the future of two channel sound.<br /><br />When stereo was first mass marketed by in the late 1950s it made sound dimensional.  For classical recordings this meant that musical instruments where not just heard but the mind could juxtapose their spatial relationship to each other.  Back then recording engineers and technicians primary goal was to place the music listener as close as possible to the conductor's box (the best &#34;seat&#34; in the house).<br />This meant that microphone placement and acoustical considerations were critical.  Greater microphone distance from the orchestra and excessive reverberations were the enemies to achieving that recording goal.  This recording places the listener far back in the concert house where the qualities of stereo have for the most part been lost.  I have found it difficult if not impossible to identify instrumental placement and the sound lacks clarity. Listen to recordings of these works in the 90's, 80's, 70's and yes even in the 60's where these attributes were highly evident. You can listen with distinction through both ears.<br /><br />Today we seem to be traveling back to the 1950s to the days of monaural (single track) high fidelity.  When stereo was first arriving a lot of single track rock and roll recordings were being converted to &#34;fake&#34; (two track) stereo with lots of &#34;reverb&#34; added.  It was called &#34;duophonic&#34;.  If we continue to replace the attributes of true stereo by making the orchestra sound further removed from the listener and introducing  greater reverb that is where we will end and our ears will not be the better for it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The quality was very good. I am satisfied with the movie. Everything that was supposed to be in the package was there.
B007XCH1AA|1.0|I just picked up a copy of the 2 disc. I also own the [[ASIN:B0000004TZ original USA cd]] (which also has a different track listing for the 10 songs on it).<br /><br />For some reason I had a suspicion that this might be a LOUD remaster (LOL). On the \\"remaster\\" the original tracks had a Foobar Dynamic Range of 8 (AWFUL). The original had a \\"13\\" score, which is THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN FROM A ROCK CD. The only better 44/16 score I've ever seen was an acoustic jazz cd.<br /><br />Of course, despite primitive 80's a/d convertors (which produce lots of grain & lack of detail), the original sounded tons better due to the lack of shrill compression. Amazing how much things have changed for the worst. And sad, because a combo of today's electronics with no-minimal compression can produce stunning results; including at 44/16 especially with HDCD.<br /><br />I have not heard the [[ASIN:B002OHB2TA Wounded Bird 1 disc]].<br /><br />I'm assuming that anyone looking at this set is familiar with the original album. I consider it a fun (though somewhat mindless) 80's \\"guilty pleasure\\" & probably her best.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Bosch still is an. Intelligent principled cop,  father, citizen. An interesting person, someone to like, wish we bad more like him. A fun read
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner by James Dashner is an excellent book.  The story is about a boy named Thomas who is dropped off in a mysterious Glade.  He is surrounded by a group of only boys who are living in fear of these horrible Grievers and trying to solve the maze that surrounds their home.  After a first day of asking questions with no answers, everything changes as for the first time a girl is delivered to the Glade.<br />Things go from bad to worse for Thomas as the girls arrival comes with a message that everything will change.  Thomas becomes obsessed with becoming a runner and solving the riddle of the maze so he and his new friend Chuck can get home.<br />Dashner is an expert at the cliff hanger.  Each chapter is crafted so you can't put this book down.  It leaves you wanting more.  I really enjoyed this book and am now looking forward to the movie which is scheduled to come out next February.<br />As far as Dystopias go, this genre is full of the books that are trying to capture the magic of The Hunger Games.  Some succeed, some fail.  This book is definitely one that falls among Divergent and The Darkest Minds as examples of great read a-likes for those who loved The Hunger Games.  I give this book my full recommendation.  Rated four stars.
B00AR3GPHW|5.0|My class is studying barn owls. This was a sweet edition to our unit. I definitely recommend this book for all ages.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had a strange story line.  It did keep you guessing throughout the book. I didn't like the unsatisfiying ending.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is an excellent writer and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The love story is moving and his character portrayals pull you into the story. I enjoyed all the fads he mentioned in the late 50's and 60's... the big fin cars, etc. It gets slow for some readers when he gives every detail of Oswald's life... but I was hooked!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Amazing info! Highly recommended to help make all relationships better. It all starts with awareness! Read it today and your life will change for the better!
B003PIUBZS|1.0|It deserves a -5. Not because of the show I love the show and this season is still my favorite. It is actually the seller that deserves a -5. A little backstory: I rented this show at a video store and I loved it, I could not stop watching it so I decided to purchase it on dvd so that I could watch it whenever I wanted.<br /><br />I purchased it from a small business, doing my part to help out the economy. When I received the series all of the disks had these tiny pieces of sponge glued on the back and if you took them off then the disks would not play. I played them and a few episodes cut out and the 4th disk would not play at all. I notified the seller and he sent me another disk, however that 1 would not play either.<br /><br />In this idiot's infinite wisdom he blamed my dvd player, not even knowing what kind of dvd player I have. All of my other movies and tv show's play on this dvd player as it works perfectly.<br /><br />When I informed him that I would like to return his shoddy merchandise for a full refund, his solution was: A) try and berate me with his victim mentality and inferiority complex and tell me how customers try to take advantage of him like this all of the time, never taking blame for the inferior product he sold me, his next solution was; B) let me watch the episode on amazon, so that I would have 3 disks that somewhat work and an episode on amazon that I could watch only once. After he accused me of purchasing the season just to watch it because in his warped brain that makes perfect sense, nevermind the fact that I had already watched every episode prior to purchasing this dvd.<br /><br />In closing, when I finally received my refund, after all the aggravation, time, and money wasted attempting to make a simple purchase. I just went to walmart and bought it like I should have done in the first place. my bad...lesson learned.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Our 2.5 year old is addicted to this movie, which we watch on Netflix. We bought it on DVD to allow her to watch it in the car. There's quite a bit of music, vibrant colors, animated characters (of course), silly animals and it's based on a Dr. Seuss story. I highly recommend if your young one can sit still for a while and be entertained. This wasn't an option for us until very recently.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Kurt Sutter takes a few pages from Shakespeare and makes it a modern day drama. Angst, power plays, romance, testosterone and like able characters - it pulls you in & makes you wanna watch every episode in one day!

B003QP4BJM|5.0|This is an excellent explanation of the importance of world trade and specialization in the growth of world wealth that has benefited millions, not just \\"the rich.\\"  You don't need to agree with Ridley's theme of optimism for the future to make this worthwhile to read.  The book is much more than the title suggests. He uses an astounding array of historical and cultural  examples to illustrate his conclusions.  He also writes with good humor, always appreciated for a good read.
B0060D133E|5.0|The kids chose this movie and, based on the requests to watch the movie, it is a huge hit in our house.
B00B6SIT0S|5.0|Dave Gahan's voice is in top form here,and it's a nice mellow,soulful track. The B-side , which i like even more is just a great surprise of pure electronics and brings back their earlier style. This has gotton me pumped for the full length release. Could this be the best album since Wilder left?
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|The kids love this movie although they get scared in some parts ( might just be my though!). Fun to watch with them for movie night.
0861714911|5.0|Is a very good book that serve the purpose of an introduction to Pali Buddhism. Very well translated and a good read too. But as I say, is an introduction, to know more of the Pali Buddhism, you need the Samyuta, Majjhima and Digha Nikaya.

B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I found this story a little mixed up. Having read and really enjoyed all past books this one just wasn't good enough. Please go back to strong characters. The need to introduce new characters is noted, but for authors who kill off main characters, like Smithback, you spent too much time on gun battles and not enough making the new characters as strong as the old.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book is NOT science.<br /><br />It's anecdote.  The plural of anecdote is not data.<br /><br />Amazon should be ASHAMED to put this under ANY other topic other than religion.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|This is a product everybody should with their apps. I would have loved it, but it takes you to an advertisement that in my view is needless. When I'm reading something and want to know the definition of a word, the extra step through an app to find the definition is bothersome. I understand that the adverts make it free, but couldn't you place it somewhere else?
1594203334|5.0|Yes we all need to follow her advice with our children. Bringing up Bebe is a great source of information with just the right amount of humor. Enjoyed.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love this game but not liking the fact that to expand the city you need to spend your own money.  I would rather buy the game and have a one time cost!!!  That is why the four stars!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I've seen this great musical twice before in London theaters. I loved the new re orchestrated music for the Royal Albert Hall event. Great music + spectacular show...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game for ten to forty-two year old's.me and my eleven year old daughter have had it for two days and we love it!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I love it. The vocals + actors + theatre settings are all great. I certainly recommend this DVD to all who love great musicals....
B00846F1YW|4.0|Good graphics and enjoyable skill levels. I would prefer adventures that didn't get into the occult and seeing into the future, especially when done by a priest..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enough different levels to allow for success...I would recommend this game for the beginner through advanced skills. The graphics were colorful.
1616550414|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  This was well-worth the money as a long-time Zelda fan.  It came packaged very nicely and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Basically, I liked it but it was a little hard for me since I am not really adroit.  It was fun though...
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It is addictive (yes, even after all these years).  I do not play many games but Freecell always provides me with a relaxing and rewarding experience.  My husband said he never realized how challenging it could be.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I felt as though I had a smile plastered on my face whist reading this book! Soooo much fun :) The epilogue was a tad cheesy (reminding me of the end of Harry Potter) but I enjoyed this quick read so much that I forgive the cheese.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Good challenge without becoming too predictable.  It offers a variety of ways to play and the different levels are also appealing.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app on any os. No complaints from me. The info is always up yo date and it is usually just as, or more, accurate than the local westher
0789310627|4.0|These books are nearly 5 decades old, and even with the end notes, they still feel very dated.  But they give the kids a view of London, and they are entertaining.  I'd love to see an updated version, not just annotated.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love star wars and this game brings great cross over features like the light saber bird and the shooting Han solo bird
B008DYZKQE|4.0|Mostly kudos for the semi-feminist tone.  Extremely short, and all of the odd flaws of his other kids books, but MUCH better art than most of those books.  Really, the only Munsch book you need.
B00005KARK|4.0|It did not come in a case, the DVD wasn't scratched or anything. I was just taken back a little about how it was presented.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash works great with my D7000. It comes with light filters and defuser. I use the defuser a lot for portraits. Having a 18-300 mm lens, the built in flash wasn't high enough and I kept getting shadows from the lense barrel. This unit solved that problem. The SB-700 has a long flash distance, it's good for large rooms and outdoors.
B002T45VX6|4.0|It didn't take long for the product to get to me  .. works perfect in my CD player case mint and everything.
B00AB0NTTI|4.0|Just seeing all these great actors together is worth the time but spoofing all the old detective movies brings about great memories.  Probably for the older crowd but very enjoyable.
B000JML7EC|4.0|It was an ok book, it was a good story but I don`t  think it was transferred very well the language just seemed off.
1591845831|4.0|I think I would sum up Enchantment rather simply: Be nice, have common sense, believe in something, & smile.<br />I agree with much of what other readers have posted on the pros & cons. You will have seen or heard ~50% of the content here in other publications &/or presentations, but nothing drones on too much and the horse hasn't been beaten too violently.<br /><br />This book is not a roadmap or playbook, but rather a collection of 'nuggets' that all have useful application at different points in time/purpose. I plan to keep this book within arms reach, just to periodically scan from time to time - it's a good refresher & idea generator for those times when things could be better (which is always).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If you are &quot;in&quot; to horse or animal games, you will LOVE this app!!! You do NOT have to pay anything to be able to complete tasks and this game is a lot of fun.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read it in serial form on Andy's web site. It's great to have it all together on my Kindle. This one definitely has the &#34;science&#34; part of science fiction and it's a great tale of people besides. You really get caught up in all the people. The cliff hangers are great! How wil he survive? Tune in next chapter.<br /><br />I kind of wish he'd priced it higher, I'd like to show my apprecation more!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Wow. This film was REALLY good. Good in a disturbing, emotional way, but good non-the-less. I agree with it's rating of PG-13, even though some 13 year old's wouldn't have a capacity for the emotional stress bleeding from the corners of the screen, I still agree. I don't like the fact that it has drugs and (some) suggestive moments, because I think that that will make it hard for some people who NEED to watch this movie and understand today's teenager to do so, but I also think that it was good; they didn't show those things in a manner that suggested good to the audience, and they didn't neglect to show the aftermath. They showed both high, and the low afterwards. Completely unbiased in that respect. So, I wholeheartedly recommend the film to my peers. Watch it, learn from it, and come away more able to deal with the thousands of neighbors you pass everyday.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|After just having read The Wench, I was surprised at how compelling the story was.  Well written, caught me from the get go.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Another wonderful score by Carter Burwell! Like he did with the score for Twilight, he's managed to make me feel like I'm watching the movie even when I'm not show to! He's a brilliant composer and has done a fine job with setting the tone musically for this movie!
B000FC12Z0|5.0|One of Dame Agatha's best!! Simply told and great mystery and surprise ending. I think she must have written this after the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. A definite puzzle!
1250006341|5.0|Very informative book - with lots of wonderful photos of our favorite show  (covers Seasons 1 & 2)  Highly recommended.
0374275637|5.0|Instant classic. It's like Dan Ariely or Freakonomics with academic framework. No easy read but extremely rewarding.<br /><br />PLOT SUMMARY: We have three different \\"battles\\" going on in our heads. We're thinking fast (\\"I don't like that guys face so he cannot be a good boss\\") and slow (\\"...on the other hand\\"). We're also thinking in terms of economics (\\"3 tomorrow is better than 2 today\\") and \\"humanly\\" (\\"50% sale sounds like a great deal, no matter what the absolute price\\"). And we have huge difficulties of remembering what we have actually experienced (\\"My life was pure awesome during University studies\\"). Dr K describes these three battles and how they affect our decision-making.<br /><br />WHAT I ENJOYED most in the book were that the countless stories about strange human behaviour described in some of my favourite books like `Predictably Irrational', `Freakonomics', `Drive', `How to win friends...' and `The Power of Habit' were given a names and framework. The book does not judge or try to teach cheap tricks, but merely describe how we all behave in a similar strange way. The book was a real eye-opener and still full of surprises for me - even though I've read maybe quite many recent books about weird human behaviour.<br /><br />WHAT I DISLIKED was the style. It was not an easy read and I'm hoping someone like Daniel Pink or Jim Collins would make an even more enjoyable version of it and maybe lose 200 pages. It would be great if someone made a \\"7-habits-style\\" picture of the behaviours and how they relate to each other.  Also the amount of examples was a bit overwhelming and some of the clarity was lost, especially since some of the examples were not all that irrefutable.<br /><br />ALL-IN-ALL one of the best books I've read and should be mandatory read for everybody.
0823015033|5.0|I love this book! Katherine Dewey takes you through each step with plenty of pictures to make a beautiful sculpture. She teaches you how to sculpt each part of the human body in great detail. This is a beautifully put together book! I would recommend this book to any artist!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Try to beat all the levels and have lots of fun.  Although a bit pointless its still a great way to pass the time.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I bought this CD together with the DVD (same title) and just like the other one, I got them for my husband and he loved them both.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Kid Rock.  What more is there to say.  Great CD and was on waiting list so got it faster than I would have gotten it at store
B00129H7VS|5.0|After reading a few &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; books, I wanted to see the mini series of the same name.  It was an excellent purchase.  The acting, scenery, character portraits , and history were top notch.  These were a unique group of men who formed a lasting bond with each other.  From training camp in Georgia to the end of the war, they remained together.  The 101st Airborne suffered many casualties and deaths.  Yet they never gave up hope in their cause and in each other.<br /><br />Recommended to all World War II history buffs and those interested in a great story, &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; does not disappoint.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has been exciting from the start - the development of the characters, the quality of the acting and the moral choices they face on a week-to-week basis is what drives the show.  Add Zombies to this, and the tension just keeps building.<br /><br />I'm not too crazy about the Governor plot-line, but that's a small gripe for an otherwise outstanding show.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|You'll get nothing less than total accolades from me whaen it comes to ANYTHING delivered by this man from the heart of early animals, to the wayward soul of sky pilot flights and decadent stops at War and solo. But this particular outing has an added spark for me. Back in the day when Free broke up I once entertained the thought of what might have been had Eric teamed up with Paul Kossoff. As a feature writer for Hit Parader I was lucky to interview Kossoff right before his untimely death. I mentioned the prospect of Burdon's voice and his guitar. Koss loved the thought and ventured he might even look in to it. At the time Kossoff was in the fabric of a band called Backstreet Crawler. well...HIGH and behold, some of the key players on this new slab of brilliance from Eric were once key players in...Backstreet Crawler. Scoop THIS and basically anything by Eric up ASAP. This music and man are golden on my backstreet.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love the main character, Emily Thorne, on Revenge. She is such an inspiring girl! I also love to watch the dynamics between Emily and Nolan Ross. He is a very fun character.<br /><br />I just never know what will happen next. It is so exciting and unpredictable. I really love this show. The story line is great, the acting is excellent. I hope it stays on the air for years and years to come.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|If you want to learn many things you missed in science class because text books were very boring, this is a wonderful book.  Dawkins blends the art of a good novel with the scientific analysis and facts to make for a very enjoyable read.
B000WTNCYA|3.0|Not as spetacular as I had hoped but nice to listen to once in a while. She has a nice voice<br />and I
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is one of the few they have made and is an awesome musical masterpiece. They creatively recreate a lot of popular pop songs, as well as musical numbers from movies, and display them through their instruments with finesse. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to explore into the classical pop genre.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Started great and then got depressing. To much drugs and alcohol. Denzel was great. All in all I did not like the movie very much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was playing Temple 1 for awhile but this one is even better.  it keeps me entertained for long periods of time.
B001NA2NM4|4.0|An oldiee but a goodie, this movie had me in tears at the end. It's from a completely different era so you will have to sit through different quality (I had a hard time with some of the sound and understanding two of the key characters) but is so worth the watch. We don't make movies like this anymore for fear of being not PC enough. Good stuff and if you love your film history, if you want to be a filmmaker, watch this movie.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|BTD5 is amazing I got it 2 days ago and can't put my Kindle down. It starts hard but is really worth it as you unlock the tower. The Super monkey can be a robot monkey with double shots or a Sun God then a Temple of the Monkey God.  You get sniper monkeys with unlimited range, Helicopter Pilots, Ninjas monkeys, and secret agents that cost monkey money earned by beating maps, each agent does something special even without attack they have some that freak if one Bloon  leaks. Every tower has two upgrade paths and can have two in both but four in one of the two paths. Every tower also has a Specialty building that enhances them,but increases the price of a different tower. The standard bloons are unchanged but they added a new blimp call a Zeppelin of Mighty Gargantuaness or ZOMG they are incredibly tough and hold four BFB's. This app is worth every penny.
B000PC6Z48|5.0|I've never been one for westerns but this movie is STUNNING. Forget the remake, this is where is is at. So many scenes left me stunned. This is the way movies should be done.
B009VB97EY|5.0|brand new dvd, quick delivery, we thought it was a great dvd to own, we all really enjoyed watching it.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This is hands down one of my favorite movies. SO much is said without much being said from Ryan Gosling's character. It's enough action to keep you suspended in it, but much is going on behind it as well. This movie caught me completely off guard (the trailers and previews don't do it justice) so I'm thankful to have gotten my hands on it. As an aspiring filmmaker and an existing actress, I can only hope to produce a quarter of the quality of this work, and I would still be successful. Buy it and let your mind be blown.
B00004CZDS|1.0|so very disappointed.  came to us and couldnt not even play it because it came overseas and was not playable on an american systwm.  I was shocked and wasted my $$$$ !!!!
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|This is a classic story (and a long one) like we no longer make in modern cinema. Brush up on your film history. Read the book and see how they adapted it into this film. It's a heart wrenching story of a family seeking a new life and follows the tragedies that occur to them under various corrupt systems. They make massive sacrifices for each other. Watch it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|hilarious movie, the whole family laughed outloud, came quickly and brand new.  a great movie for whole family to watch.
B000099T2L|1.0|This album really falls very short to me. It lacks depth in the lyrics. Beyonce or her voice just does nothing to stop the album from just coming off as generic R&B (if even that much). It almost sound like a rushed effort to me. But hey that's what i'd expected from lead singer of DC.<br />Best Songs: \\"Signs\\" & \\"Me, Myself, & I\\"  \\"Dangerously in Love\\"<br /><br />The rest if the songs are all just generic pop based R&B songs with catchy (uncatchy/annoying) hooks. Its just to repetitive and bland. If you're looking for some really good R&B try Aaliyah's \\"Aaliyah\\" or even Brandy's \\"Full Moon\\". Both albums are far more innovative and add much more to the genre in all honesty. If you're wise you'll definitely leave this one on the shelf!!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Really good CD with Neil Young's greatest hits. This CD covers a great artist through his early and later years. a good buy.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This was pretty decent book in this series.  It has a funky leading character and interesting additional characters with a good plot.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|While I am disappointed the series will not have a third season the plot development and believability took a nosedive when Jean Marsh sadly had to drop out of most of the second season as she suffered a stroke.  It became an entirely different series without her.  I read that the series was not sure if she would recover and be able to participate in the second season and they attempted to hold her spot open. It definitely suffered without her or a good script to bridge the gap.  It lost credibility especially in the last three episodes.  The ending was wholly unfortunate and unbelievable.  In the end I think Jean Marsh was only able to participate briefly in two episodes.  I would have liked to have seen a third season but while the ratings took a nose dive in the UK they remained steady in the USA.  I believe the decision to cancel was made before the second season was released in the USA and I wonder if they don't have regrets as it did well in the US market.  I have ambivalent feelings reviewing this series as I watched the original as a young boy and have very special memories of the original.  It probably deserves two starts but I can't find a way to do that to such a great cast and to the memory or the original series.  Watch it for yourself and decide.  I have no regrets....
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is super cool!!!!!!!!  I love it!!!!!!  You can also follow your family member!!!!!  If you don't want a facebook this is the way to go!!!!!!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I am a huge Bond fan so had to see the latest! Great action, some female interaction as well....typical Bond. Really liked the development of the relationship with &#34;M&#34;. Hated that his one night stand got killed off so quickly....grrr.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|If you're not watching the show...you should start.  And this is the best way to get going.  There isn't much to say about the show that hasn't been said.  All the actors do a fantastic job (especially Maggie Smith) and the stories pull you in.  It's the classiest soap opera around.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I purchased the book prior to his death and just finished reading it. Excellent book, well written. One is on the rooftops while the spent brass is clinking onto the ground.<br /><br />Excellent read, if one likes a good war memoir.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Growing up in Illinois and being involved in a state wide organization called Illinois State Junior Historians, I wanted to read this book as it was both history and biography.  Yes, it is a long book, but the writing is spectacular and Doris Kearns Goodwin has a gift of making the characters come alive.  I have read many books about Lincoln and I think this is the best one ever.  It provides a real window into the time, his life, and the lives of those he chose to include in his presidency. I felt a deeper appreciation for and understanding of Lincoln when I finished reading this book.<br /><br /> Anyone who enjoys American History will find it a difficult book to put down.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Good- not great!  The plot didn't seem to flow. Part of the problem was that even though we have high speed cable internet the movie kept stopping to &#34;load&#34; which was very annoying.  My 13 year old son left the movie mid-stream to go back to his computer games if that means anything.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Not sure how to rate this since it was not rented for my benefit. My aunt and Uncle were over for a visit and they wanted us to see this. They loved it but I am more for Disney Cartoon Movies than this. Does not fit my style I guess.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great fun; brain drain time; addictive; mindless stress reliever; enjoyed the past time or should I say wasted time?  Yes...
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The show was good but it felt more pieced together and not fully thought out. Most of the show just felt like the editor went nuts pasting together scenes hoping to fit them together cutting out a lot of more informative pieces. The first two Batman shows seemed like it could have been more real than the others that followed a more comic book routine. Not saying the movie was not worth a watch but more informative scenes bringing about the logic of the events would have made it a lot better than just the action sequences. I would say watch it but don't expect it to be the best.
B008H5J510|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch in 3d. There is a lot of 3d features. The movie pops out.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|I had to watch it since I grew up on the Dr. Seuss cartoons and books. Danny DeVito did a good job as the voice of the Lorax. The show was good but I guess since I am not a child anymore the music scenes got more on my nerves. It did bring a laugh and I thought it was cute in a lot of areas so it is watching once. Glad I rented it.
0767802519|4.0|Very good movie! Jean Reno is a great actor and Natalie Portman does a great playing such a grown part.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I can't deny that I liked this book. I had to keep reading to see what would happen and I was invested in the story and rooting for the characters. But they did have a pretty tumultuous relationship that consisted of jealousy, co-dependence and controlling behavior. The reality is that a lot of women would pick Travis because he is the sexy bad boy. But can he truly change for the long haul? Will they always have drama in their lives? Some people would call it passion, but it might get old over the years. Plus the level of insecurity in Travis would be hard to deal with.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|perfect for a tackle box. if you need to quickly sharpen a fillet knife just grab your pocket sharpener and with a few passes you are ready to cut.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Story line engaging! Characters are believable and identify with the great number of viewers who watch! Realistic in the hardships that are faced in living during end of days times. Like how groovy the living dead are portrayed.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I love love love this movie.  It is so cute, sweet, well-done and teaches some great lessons about the true meaning of Christmas.  I think this movie is sure to be a classic.  I am an adult, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  However, I think small children would also enjoy it.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Good for productivity. Simple application interface. Good sync features. Nice colors. Quick &amp; easy project. Love it. Thank you 6Wunderkinder.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Exceptional quality in Blu-ray - crystal clear, like they're in your livingroom. Doesn't get much better than this! Except of course...
0312330537|5.0|This is simply the most amazing life story, from an everyday normal life that falls apart and the turn of events that follow, takeing him half way around the world,through adversity, unbelievable events & challenges.<br />This is one of the top 5 books you will read in your life, it is my number 1.<br />Buy it, you will not regret it, I have purchased 6 copies in total of this book, 2 for me, 4 as gifts.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book after deciding to read it after an interesting recommendation for it I received, from a friend. Reading it is a bit like therapy.  Some will be able to readily identify with not just the main character, but with many of the other characters as well.  For most of us who have been betrayed or experienced loss that changes your life, the journey through this book is understandable and close to heart.<br />The author has a keen way of putting a string of thought to paper.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Just as it says, I didn't think it could get better, but it did.  I loved the 1st season, and I like the idea that each season has a separate storyline; the possibilities are endless, and as a fan, that makes me very happy  :)  I would recommend AHS: Asylum to any fan of horror.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love Angry Birds and was really upset that Google stopping selling an ad-free version from the Play Store just as I was ready to buy. Now Amazon gets the sale. That's all there is to say.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The story is set in three European countries, each affected by war and political intrigue.<br /><br />It starts in Bratislave in 1933, when the heroine, Greta Weissensteiner meets and is immediately attracted to a young bookseller. The writer's skill is evident this early on when he successfully depicts the difference in these two lovers. Two quite different characters, she a serious, quite old fashioned young lady, he a  mischievous, devil may care romantic. Christoph Fischer captures the differences beautifully, together with the internal battles of each character to overcome them.<br /><br />But such minor conflicts pale into insignificance as the full story takes over. It is, effectively, an incredibly powerful holocaust story, a tale which throws two families, one Jewish, one catholic, into turmoil.<br /><br />Enduring love is challenged by the horrors of war, and the writer makes you care about each and every character.<br /><br />It is not so much about the victims of the holocaust itself, as those on the edge of it, experiencing the heartache of it all, without the actual physical contact.<br /><br />The Luck of the Weissensteiners is the first of a planned trilogy, the complete work looking set to become a classic of our time.<br /><br />This is not a book that you will read and immediately forget. The effects of it will linger on, and that is the mark of a truly talented author.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love Angry Birds and was really upset that Google stopping selling an ad-free version from the Play Store just as I was ready to buy. Now Amazon gets the sale. That's all there is to say.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Orson Scott Card gives an explanation on how this book came about. Indeed, the story's society is supposed to be oppressive but not as much as one would think from a book written when the Soviets were still in power. The storyline at the beginning is great but after a while it gets repetitive and unfortunately, the punchline can be guessed before it comes. Finally, using dreams as a tool to complement the story is something of a let down. It's not what one would call &#34;hard science fiction&#34;. Quite mild really.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Very entertaining movie.  Alot of good action  and a very good story line. Can't wait  for<br />Thor 2  to come out.
1936608898|5.0|I can say without question that this is a book you will never regret purchasing!  In fact, if you read it and do as it says, you'll be feeling and looking better than you ever have, and will be suggesting it to every one you know.  I've been working out and \\"dieting\\" pretty consistently for a few years, and had dropped a few pounds and put on a little muscle.  But the Whole30 changed my life.  I feel better than I ever have.  I perform better in the gym and in life than I ever have.  I have more energy, my mind is clearer, and I love the food I eat.  This is a MUST READ for anyone who wants to improve their health.  Get it, and get it NOW!
B00933JL0A|4.0|I think this game will be fun. Also this will be a good game to take time off of me.  :p
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game love the hog games that also have puzzles to solve and this one has it all. if you like midnight mysteries and lost city then get this game. interesting story line nice long game and cheaper than midnight mysteries. the only thing that would improve this game is being able to change locations via the map-there is a lot of backtracking but still one of my favs.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It is great for messaging because you have access to the goofy smilies. My wall posts are typically images/photos, it only shows about 10 images/photo posts, and then it changes to all text and no pictures. I have to go to the mobile site in order to view all posts that are images/photos. Used on Kindle Fire Tablet7\\" LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8GB.
B000XXI8EO|5.0|I bought these boots for my son.  We had to return a couple before we finally got the right size.  I suggest that you order a full size smaller than your normal size.  My son wears them every day all day.  They are very comfortable and seem to get more so every day.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I recommend this book to book clubs. There are so many characters and twists to discus. I enjoyed the people/characters and how real the story seems. Human emotion and experience were explored with delicacy and dignity.  This is a book I will buy multiple copies of so I can give it as a gift to many of my friends. :)
B004CFBMRY|4.0|A ripper read...very hard to put down. Has given me more incentive to improve my own running and i'm 62.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Not sure if I consider them contemporary country or crossover pop. Either way they have a great sound and harmony. Loved this album from the time I heard the first single.

1479189154|5.0|I think this book is great, but only if you like reading books. If you do not like books, than this book is not for you.  I would instead recommend spending your time not reading books and doing something else that you enjoy doing.  Perhaps you like coloring, and should buy a coloring book.  But wait, if you don't like books, then you can't buy a coloring book either.  I would actually suggest stepping back, sitting down and writing a book about things in life that you enjoy doing.  BUT DON'T READ THE BOOK AFTER YOU WRITE IT (since you don't like reading books).
0452287588|5.0|...if you are spiritually inclined. Very easy to read and apply. I have given this book away several times. I like it better than The Power of Now because it is a bit gentler.
B002QGSYRC|5.0|I highly recommend. Smells great and taste even better.  Good quality and perfect size. If I could, I would give it 6 stars. I liked it on facebook. I hooked it up to my generator and it was like bam! terminator 2. Try adding syrup for additional productivity.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait for the new episodes! I watched the first two seasons consecutively and it did not get boring. Highly recommend.
B006CBSE86|5.0|I was one of the skeptics of Nightwish once Tarja left; I love her sound and her voice. She was very much a great part of the soul that was Nightwish and I didn't know if they would be the same. &#34;Dark Passion Play&#34; didn't prove anything with their next up lead vocalist, Anette Olzon, but this time around with &#34;Imaginaerum&#34; she really shines and I think it's because she has had enough time now to really blend into Nightwish's legacy. It's too bad that she too has departed from Nightwish's ranks as well.<br /><br />In any case this album is fun, exciting and blends all sorts of sounds and concept lyrics into a story...something that I always love. Give it a go!
0316236535|5.0|This has been my daughter's all time favorite book. It is easy enough for her to learn to read the book herself. She loves making the monster appear one part at a time as we turn each page and then making him disspear in  reverse order.  To pictures are vivid and memorable. The best part is the end where the monster disappears and we  read &#34;and don't come back until I say so.&#34; It is a great book and I would definitely recommend it for preschool age or a little older.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|It keeps my fingerprint smudges off the screen and also allows me to highlight links that are too small for my finger tips.  The &#34;pen&#34; comes with three stylus sizes (one under the cap and at each end of the pen).
B005COO1X6|5.0|I loved the story it merits a full size book. It's too short I really wanted to know what is next..
B00APUYWYA|5.0|this movie is awesome, super funny and I can watch it over and over again.. definitely a great rental movie
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I like their take on the Green Arrow. They didn't make him all perfect and amazing like some superhero movies. The Arrow is flawed just like every other human-being. The situations that are presented via &#34;TV episode&#34; make him some one to relate to although some of the situations are a bit different than the usual family dispute. The story line is also some thing to comment on. they portrayed him as a long time cast away on the most dangerous island in the world. Rather than just having an idea to be come a super hero and all of a sudden he is amazing with a bow and Arrow.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I started reading this series a very long time ago. The first three books were excellent and kept to the point. The fourth book was too long in coming and lost some coheision, but I still like it. It has been too long again for the next book. Hope it comes soon. I would like to know how it all ends.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well written, suspenseful and many extra twists to the plot !  I would read this author again and recommend to others.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Super simple to play.  Great game for kids, whether for short or long play.  Graphics are just like the cartoon, and the audio is good for non readers.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Rented this for my grandsons and wasn't sure if they would like it or not but, they really enjoyed the actionAlso, it had a very good message about children and how they view their parents.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|kindle was a christmas present. didn't know it would not fit my kindle HD i don't use it at all!!!! needs to be switch or returned.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a really fun game. I really love it. and play it all the time when I have nothing to do
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed it very much! I finished it about 8 hours after I started and I stooped reading at least 4 times.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm a collector of T. Clancy books--I buy the hard copies for my library  and also buy it for my Kindle because the books are so heavy to hold as you are reading them.  And once I start them, it's very difficult to put them down.  However, since I'm  not very technical and computers and I are not best friends, it was a little difficult to follow sometimes, but the characters are still strong and portayed very well.  Will be anxious for the next one.
B001LRJH0U|2.0|I liked the movie, but the sound fades in a lot of places in the movie while the actors are talking.  Hard to understand what they are saying.  I just ordered the movie.  I watched movie twice.  I would like to return it for another copy.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Amazon.com.  It's the best. Everything is just as it is advertised. Can't go wrong.  Don't hesitate. I can always depend on it for the best.
B007RXRSEY|4.0|A Guns fan but really just Appetite and then some sporadic songs here and there. Loved Velevet Revoler too.  Also, really liked the first two Alter Bridge albums and liked Kennedy's voice a lot more than Stapp.<br />This album has real teeth. Check out the two singles (standing in the sun (3) and Anastasia (8)). And I really like No More Heroes (5). If these don't get you going, this isn't the album for you.<br /><br />Don't let anybody tell you there isn't any good rock and roll out there.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Don't think twice...just buy it. Mumford & Sons' sound is great! I thoroughly enjoy both the laid back and upbeat songs. And I trust you will, too.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book! In my opinion, it was better than 50 Shades!! Couldn't wait to read the second book, not happy the third one doesn't come out until June.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is a must buy.  The unique sound of Mumford & Sons is truly enjoyable.  I can't stop listening to &#34;Sigh No More&#34;!!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Easy to use, a great set of features, and fully customizable. I like that you can use MP3 music for alarms.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child reader in grade school, my son AJ really enjoyed it.
B00280LYHS|3.0|This book wasn't too bad. I thought it had great characters and an interesting story. It could've hinted a little bit more on the Selena's betrayal.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a great page turner I could not put the book down. The author turns words into a beautiful picture.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Love the format Stoker used to tell this story.  Great development of the characters and a chilling portrayal of Dracula.
B007C86OQ2|5.0|For an older movie with no CG this movie was very entertaining and had my attention all the way through.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun app. The motion of the horse is captured very well. However the game sometimes takes a long time to load.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was the best book I've ever read. It's so good I almost cried when it was over): I loved it!
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|its fake, it makes you download other apps and then gives you 3 networks to hack into, but it didn't even give me my network to hack into, to save your self some time the passwords are, jaguar, beach, iceman
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was surprisingly good. At times it was so sad though, I had to put it down....add some Irish humor in there and a surprise ending, it all ended up to be a very good read.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Yeah!! Been 20 yrs and it just got better!! This is an amazing movie, all the right pieces of cinematography! One of the few I can watch over and over.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the whole series of hunger games. Very active with stuff.<br />I definitely think that you should read this series.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I really enjoyed this game a lot. Only  drawback was it was too short. I had no issues with the game not working correctly. This was a fatd and i plan on playing more games by nevosoft.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It was 2 1/2 hours of action-packed scenes from start to finish. I highly recommend it if you need your action-junkie fill!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I'm currently in the first semester of grad school and it is extremely stressful. Being able to read this book seriously took away the stressors of the day and let me relax, sit back, and have a laugh. It was definitely necessary for me to keep my sanity. Thank you, Ellen.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Exactly what 3 stars represent: it's ok. It definitely isn't the Bourne Identity Trilogy that I grew to love. Yet it's a good one-timer movie (in my opinion).
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found this book riviting, a must read if anyone really wants to know the training and dedication that our military and special forces give EVERY DAY of their careers. To know what really went into finding and terminating Osama Bin Laden from the mouth of someone that was really there was increadable. If you revere the military for what they thanklessly do for us on a daily basis, you will be even more thankful when you read this riviting account of their heroism. A must read!
B000Q6GX8Q|4.0|Casablanca Classic Movie in Black and White... now available on Blu Ray great video and audio.  No issues with this Movie and the move to Blu Ray and preservation is something that is Classic.  Glad that it was not Colorized.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is non stop action and the plot is not predictable.  I love the characters.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|It was so interesting to find out what really happened.  Ben Affleck did a great job as actor, director and producer.<br />Ann
0307740919|4.0|This was the first book I have read by Toni Morrison. I was able to finish the book in about 6 hours of reading, it is not long. I found that I could read her text quicker than most other writers, possibly because she has trimmed down the story to the absolute essentials.<br /><br />It is the story of an African American veteran of the Korean war, Frank Money, returning to the United States in a state of mourning and depression and shock after seeing two close friends killed in front of him during the Korean conflict. But his shock is increased and even goes underground as he witnesses and experiences the  effects of Jim Crow repression upon the African American community. It is also about his sister, Cee, who has another story to tell of the medical objectification of blacks by the whites in America. Frank is four years older than his sister Cee and the book begins as they are children witnessing some ambiguous violence being imposed upon African Americans by Klan-like forces.<br /><br />Through episodes of the childhood of Money and his sister, we see the permeation of prejudice into all aspect of African American life in America. There is one scene where white police officers are stopping black men and shaking them down for weapons, drugs, and money. When they see the Korean medal on the chest of Money they let him go. Morrison implies that to be given a ‘break’ by the unfair white power structure is not really a break at all for you are still under the power of others and your friends and family are all subject to this oppressive force.<br /><br />But as Frank wanders in a fog of regret, depression, alcohol, and grief his sister calls for his help and he responds. Frank has had terrible experiences in Korea and the quest to find and save his sister Cee is the theme of the story – healing yourself by saving others. Toni Morrison has an ear for African American dialogue which she expresses with wit and wisdom. The book is full of accounts of the survival techniques of the African American community in the face of racism and trauma.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|This series lacks a certain spark that great books have.  The plot can be a bit predictable.  It's not an awful read but nothing to scream out load about.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|I'm always looking for music that doesn't sound like everything else out there, regardless of genre. So when I read an article about Jose' James' No Beginning, No End in the Los Angeles Times, I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did. This is an amazing, creative, original, beautiful CD by a gifted and talented singer/songwriter/producer. Take the voice and musical signature of D'Angelo, throw in a little classic Bill Withers, the gutsiness of the late Gil Scott-Heron, and the sweetness of Aaron Neville, and you'll begin to have an idea of Jose's vocals. Officially, this is a jazz album, recorded for the great Blue Note label, but it crosses all genres, from out and out R&B, to jazz, to touches of pop and even country. Yet all of it is passionate, beautiful, and totally unforgettable. I suspect nearly everyone who hears this CD will have a different favorite cut, but you'll ultimately like ALL of the tracks. My favorites are Come to My Door (both the regular and acoustic versions), and the slow jam of the century, the seven minute plus but still way too short \\"Do You Feel.\\" I defy you to listen to this song and not be moved by it, both by Jose's haunting vocals and the piano work that is not credited but is most likely by recent Grammy winning pianist Robert Glasper. My only complaints about this CD is that there is no background info on James itself, and that Blue Note, a renowned jazz label, didn't see fit to list the musicians who accompany James. But those are minor complaints. This is a performance that is destined to be classic!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|This game gives you no direction to try and figure out how to play it.  I wasted my money buying this game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two continues the great story, but wait until you see season 3! If you want to start watching, don't start in the middle, you will not have near as much fun.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This takes some patience to play. I love my hidden object games this just is not one of my favorites.

0439813786|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for a young man who is one of my favorite people.  He's 9 and an avid reader.  We had bought the Hugo movie but wanted him to read the book first.  Thinking it would take him a week or more (due to it's size), we tucked the movie away.  He sat and poured through the book non-stop for three days ~ and loved it.  Next time we're together, I think I'll ask to borrow it as it is a beautiful, delightful book.

B009IEXKXI|3.0|Pretty good. Nice but not overwhelming details. It got a bit lost just over half-way through. Did recover somewhat. Good humour. Good technical knowledge and had lots of fun with the technical gimmickry of Mr. Can-Do Man at the centre, but that tends to lead you to start thinking of the technical omissions (i.e., the things-that couldn't-be-explained-away-easily), like, where were the half-mile-thick lead shields everyone on these multi-year space journeys would need to cower behind?
034580404X|5.0|Gave as a gift.  SUPER ANNOYED that you require me to type so many words before you accept my rating!!  Be glad I am taking the time at all!!  Grrr... ;-P
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Samsara is a cornucopia of sight and sound,flowing from a strongly consistent vision, executed in the highest form of the art. Seeing the extras that are included in the blu-ray increased my respect for the care, commitment and work that went into this project.

B00004SPYJ|5.0|Dino Delaurentis made a masterpiece screen play. This is timeless and beautifully done. I wish I had time for twenty more words :)
0634022296|5.0|5 stars not because it is perfect but because it is the best book of its kind.  some chord alignment errors but overall great
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was very cleverly written - intriguing book...one that you want to ponder late at night when you can meander through your head.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The blu-ray features are more entertaining than the actual movie. Alot of great work went into making the film. Shame it didnt turn out as good as it might've.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it but I think it could be better like you could open chests and stuff like that but you can't so it's kind of stupid.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|pretty interesting insight into a world not written about very often. very good quick read for anyone interested in the topic.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Terrific read. DeMille is truly one of the best. I would encourage everyone to read his works, they are great!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Loved this book it captured me and held me until the last. The end was a bit confusing at first but the more I thought about it the more confusing it got, so I read a review on good reads and it made it somewhat clearer to me. The jist of what it said was that which ever ending you choose to believe is the right one for you. On one had you have the storythat Pi told, a not so easily believed tale that has evidence supporting it to be true. Then you have the cold hard facts which are so gruesome that they seem more likely, for the situation that Pi was it. The way in which people view things is all about experience and imagination, if you are more inclined to believe the cold facts then you have less imagination and or your experiences have made it so that you are more likely to believe the negative. However the story that was told had a lot on religion and was ment to \\"make you believe in god\\" because of how fantastical his survival is, it does make you question how he could have survived on a life raft with Richard Parker for that amount of time... I choose to believe the story that was told rather then the one he yold the Japanese men because even though the other one seemed more likely there where a few things even in that story that didn't add up. What really made me believe was the fact that the story had so much detail that would be hard to make up even in a crazed state and the evidence of the meerkat bones in the boat. I enjoyed this book because it really made me think and would recommend people to read it with an open mind.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Like everyone else, we have found Downton Abbey to be well written, interesting and exciting.  We quickly became addicted and I have given the series to a couple of people as gifts.  We cannot wait until the next series is out and in fact, I have gotten so involved, I purchased the companion book!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great new features to an already addicting game. Easy to learn and play good job. Rope slide is awesome and the new monster scary
B004FPZ2KY|4.0|The book is a classic and my all time favorite.  I read it every year, so I bought it for my Kindle.  The Illustrated edition is not worth an extra cost, as they are light and you can't read the type below them on the Kindle.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I fell in love with Downton Abbey when I first found season 1 on Netflix.  I try and catch each episode but sometimes work does not permit it so decided to get the DVDs so that I can watch when I like and as many times as I like.  This series keeps you riveted - never a dull moment.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|i can not put this down, fantastic storyline. five stars are not enough. you know it is good when you pick up a regular book and touch the page to change pages and nothing happens because it is not your kindle.
B008BGNMZU|3.0|This cd was ok. I have majority of Fourplays cd's and this cd was not one of the best cd's by this group.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|It's awesome and it's awesome it's a great way to begin the final chapter I love this movie and now it's on extended edition

B0083Z614S|5.0|This was a great little book. Some really good stuff to hold on to. I would recommend this for anyone of any age but especially for anyone feeling a little discouraged with life. Really lifted me up. Thanks.
B00136Q4P0|5.0|we usually listen good music when driving somewhere, usually a road trip will take 2 to 4 hours. we like Michael Jackson's music and is never boring or annoying at all. sound quality is great as well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is great!  amazing graphics.  great story line.  lots of hidden object scenes, more than most games.<br />also longest game game I've played in a long time.  There is lots of adventure and minigames too.  I like that you can skip a minigame if you want to.<br /><br />VERY well worth the $4.99.  highly recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it!!<br />The game is clear and it keeps my interest .<br />My children love competing for gold coins .
B0085LEU02|5.0|Constantine's Dream is driving me nuts. I've listened to it a couple times a day for a week. The rest of the album is good too,<br /> but Constantine's Dream is truly a masterpiece.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Fun little app! Very addictive! It is another great addition to the angry birds family! A must have for people who are bored!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great concept and keeps things moving so you can't close it and get some sleep.  Great for children of the 80s, but probably entertaining for most adults.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Twitter is fun but I use it from a bystander vantage point. I don't have any interest in starting Twitter wars etc, I just like checking out pics and up to date news.
B008Y73940|5.0|Saw the trailer and had to see the movie. Matthew McConaughey is superb in this role. A great supporting cast adds depth to the understated storyline that carries through the whole movie. It moves that a good plot line and fine acting all around can carry a movie without the next for wild special effects.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I . LOVE the game and its . Worth the money but I wish after I downloaded the game I didn't have to wait for another download
B0094K1WZE|4.0|A predictible storyline and spectacular special effects delivery what MI fans come to expect. The supporting cast add more interest to the movie than the Tom Cruise character.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|awesome and understandable definitions i don't really like reading but i enjoy just looking on my kindle and finding definitions i appreciate this being free
B009K86D86|5.0|Very eye opening. So glad we watched.  I had no idea how our food made it to the grocery store.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Amazing. Emotional rollercoaster. Loved it. I couldn't put it down. You go James Dashner. One of my favourite series ever. By far. Thanks for the fun. -Payton
B004TI5N38|4.0|I don't typically read this type of book (crime/mystery), but I wanted to try something different.  I found that I enjoyed it very much, and that the book moved along quickly.  I read other reviews before purchasing the book about how the author talks about WV mining communities, but doesn't dwell on them too much.  Although these descriptions didn't go on for pages, the author did bring the subject up alot.  I read a clear dislike of the type of mining occuring in the book, and mining in general, and an environmental agenda that didn't add to the story.  The descriptions were enough.  The author's one-sided narration was not necessary and took away from the story.  I don't know where on stand on the mining issue, hearing one side only, but I wasn't interested in reading about it in Zero Day.  That aside, it was fun to read.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|One of the best series EVER. Suspenseful, scary, and mind blowing plot twists. And, Evan peters is really hot so that's a bonus
B00A655N8I|5.0|It was not so long ago that the prospect of a new recording of any complete segment of the Ring aroused excited anticipation, but for the last 20 years or so this has been replaced by anticipated disappointment to outright dread!<br />Cycles from Haenchen, Simone Young, Weigel and Thielemann have all had their merits, but vocally they have been at best serviceable.<br />While Elder got his putative cycle off to a magnificent reverse start, the second instalment was a disappointment and it is unclear as to whether a full cycle will yet emerge. I found the recent Gergiev recording of Parsifal to be a qualified success, with again some vocal frailties being the cause of disappointment, so with the strength of the casting in this set, it was with a long lost sense of excitement that I opened the box on this cycle.<br />It is easy to understand why W&auml;lkure was chosen to start the cycle, as it is the most popular work by far and the most often given as a \\"stand alone\\" performance, and we must remember that this cycle derives from concerts where it was important to get off to \\"a flying start!\\" Karajan adopted the same strategy for his 1960's cycle. I expected Gergiev to dive in with both feet and give us a fiercely driven reading which outpaced Leinsdorf, but I could not have been more wrong. I should not have been so surprised at the slower tempo however, as memories of Gergiev's Kirov Ring in Cardiff and London are of very slow tempi which I put down to necessity through unfamiliarity by singers and orchestra (it was a mess!), but it would appear is actually Gergiev's interpretative stance. We are not talking Goodall or Kna here, but it is expansive in the Karajan vein without being able to maintain Karajan's sublime and almost ethereal long line especially in Act One.<br />I'm not mad about the Maryinsky Concert Hall Acoustics which are a bit dry and accentuate the rather wiry quality of the lower strings which results in bass light recordings when no audience is present, but here, with an audience present there is sufficient air around the musicians to give pleasing results.<br />The recording, produced by the ubiquitous James Mallinson, is well balanced and detailed and the orchestra plays very well, with the usual sheen to the upper strings, rather \\"buzz saw\\" lower strings and trumpets and horns with just a hint of the \\"blarpy\\" sound that used to characterise all brass sections in Russian Orchestras, We certainly know we're not in Vienna or Berlin, or indeed London.<br />Vocally the expectations are more or less met. FINALLY we get a complete role recorded by Kaufmann, and he is the best Siegmund since Vickers, many would suggest the best in the stereo era and though I don't necessarily agree, I wouldn't argue either-it's very close!<br />His extended cries of \\"W&auml;lse\\" raise the hairs on the neck, the \\"Winterst&uuml;rme\\" is both heroic and tender in equal measure, and even in what can be a real drag in the wrong hands, the \\"Todesverkundigung\\" scene , he is superb and very affecting. He makes a triumph of the role.<br />He is partnered by Anja Kampe instead of the seemingly default Westbroek, a singer who has been singing Isolde and Br&uuml;nnhilde for some time, and who has a powerful attractive upper register but has the usual difficulties in the mid range. She gives a feisty performance, not in the same vein as Janowitz, Brouwensteijn or Crespin, and relies on her vocal acting rather than the nature of the voice to convey vulnerability. I like her performance-she sings thrillingly at times-but she is not my favourite Sieglinde by a long way. Petrenko's Hunding, familiar from the Rattle filmed performance, is a more sinister, younger sounding character, far from the hulking bully we usually get and is very effective.<br />The Fricka of Gubanova is steady voiced and hectoring, a real \\"shrew\\" but not much else. However, it's a relief to hear the part so well sung. The Valkyries are reasonably secure with occasional \\"Slavic tendencies\\"<br />Nina Stemme is the Br&uuml;nnhilde of this generation, and in modern terms she is superb, with thrilling \\"Ho-Jo-To Ho's\\" as she enters, and rich fulsome tone throughout. She too has more than a touch of the wobbles in the lower range, but she counters this with a wonderful dramatic sense and understanding of the role. She is perhaps nearest to Varnay in vocal quality and is particularly fine in her extended duets with Wotan.<br />Which brings us to Ren&eacute; Pape: He is one of the finest Wotans in this work since George London and Thomas Stewart. He has rich firm tone, a secure upper register and in his performance conveys wonderfully the exultation followed by frustration in Act 2, and the anger and finally love and compassion in Act 3. Although he is nominally a bass, there is none of the fragility in the upper register of Tomlinson, and of course Hotter in later years. He outclasses a now shaky Terfel in vocal quality, and is a tad less histrionic in his acting which I prefer.<br />So, back to Gergiev's conducting. He steers it all beautifully, supporting the singers well, and conjuring up really lush sound in the lyrical passages especially, and the show stopping moments such as the sword coming out of the tree, the Ride of the Valkyries and Wotan's Farewell are all well done though Gergiev picks up the tempo for the Feuerzauber and robs it of some its grandeur...and yet, and yet there is a little something lacking-dare I say it, but a little more drive would be welcome,and in his seeking to achieve a chamber-like quality at times the orchestra ends up sounding thin on the ground, but I don't want to exaggerate this-it is INFINITELY preferable to the perfunctory style of the likes of Janowski and even Haenchen. So all in all it is a great success. Is it my favourite recording? Not by a long way, that's a straight slugfest between Leinsdorf and Karajan, but it is one with which I would be reluctant part and to which I will return with pleasure. I suppose in terms of a really modern recording it deserves 5 stars, as I would award Leinsdorf 10 and Karajan 9.99 stars respectively. If we are to view 5 Stars as the absolute maximum award for all comers, then I guess the correct rating would be 3.5 to 4 stars.<br />Those for whom SACD is a prerequisite need not hesitate as I cannot envisualise the Janowski rivalling this set in overall quality, not least singing, and the Haenchen is just not in contention.<br />Highly recommended as a very enjoyable if slightly different take on the work, sounding a touch different from other recordings, and not only with no vocal weaknesses, but many vocal triumphs as well. I look forward to future instalments with restored entusiasm if not excitement.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book....could not put it down... even read it while eating...but his books always are great. It is a real five star.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Very good, but not as interesting as the first two seasons.  With only 8 episodes, the season did not really get into anything very interesting.  I hope season 4 will be longer and have a more involved story line.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I love  james bond  007  movies, and  daniel  craig  gives  his all..... he is so good.and it does  keep you guessing  to the end.

1936608898|5.0|Changed my life, can't say enough good things about the book (easy to read, relate-able, informative, etc.).  If you are sick of being sick and tired, buy this book, read it in a night and start NOW.  You are strong enough, I won't say it will be easy, but it will be more than worth it. :)
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a match-pairs puzzle that you can rotate in 3D using gestures.  The animation is beautiful and smooth.  You need to touch each block to remove it, and that is a bit ticklish on a 10&#34; screen.  Sometimes it takes a couple of taps for the device to detect.  On a smaller one, you might need a stylus or something.  The untimed version gets a little dull after a while because nothing changes, and there is also a timed challenge where you start with a few blocks and more are added while you try to get ahead of them until you are finally overwhelmed.  I think the idea of the timed mode is to see how long you can go before you are defeated, but it feels like you just always lose.  It would be more satisfying if they gave you a finite number of blocks and a set time to try to remove them in order to win and then had succeeding levels with more blocks and/or less time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first read the description my first thought was, \\"I think I am a little too old to read about high school kids,\\" but after reading Hopeless, I now know you are never too old to read an AMAZING story of \\"Hope.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Hoover weaved a story of love, compassion, forgiveness and finding peace when the world around you is not what you thought it was.<br /><br />I totally fell in love with Holder and Sky.  They were destined to be together.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book in the series.
B009O2XY12|3.0|When will the game developers learn that this is not a good model to monetize their game?  This is just another of the match-three-bubble puzzles.  It starts out too easy and quickly becomes unplayable unless you buy their junk.  Just look for a different game.  There are plenty of them out there.
B006LSZECO|1.0|My Kindle book stopped early and I had to go to a<br />book store to read the author's final chapters. It was<br />very good until that.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I played this on a 10&#34; tablet.  I don't know how you could possibly play on a smaller screen.  There is a real problem in being unable to change the background color of the surface under the puzzle pieces (dark blue). and in not being able to zoom in and out.  I found that the pieces that belonged together didn't particularly look as if they would fit, but when you got them close, they would assemble themselves.  Maybe a future update will take care of some of these shortcomings, but it will not be able to change your screen size.  Maybe jigsaw puzzles just don't belong on the small screen?  If you are going to download and play this, choose lignt-colored puzzles.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While the writing is certainly not great the story is captivating and addicting, definitely had to read all three books. The books are not even just super hot sex scenes but about an obsessive love story. I enjoy the series very much.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app to have when you want to know the weather day by day  or When a storm is coming in. I always rely on my accurate weather. Hasn't let me down yet. Would highly recommend this app.
B000FC146C|5.0|I loved this book when I was younger and of course loved the mini-series.  From time to time I read it again and now have it on my Kindle.  So well written and so moving.  Just a wonderful read.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|The best of the trilogy, in my opinion. Apart from the plot, a few interesting insights into Swedish society.A shame there will be no more
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I learned a bit of history in a very cool way<br /> They did a good job with this true story<br /> Kept me watching and interested all the way till the end.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|I got into Jack White later in his career, and I couldn't tell you how happy I am that i did. I went back and got the old White Stripes stuff and I couldn't believe how good of a rock writer this guy truly is. So with that I decided to check this album out and it just blew me away. The guys really got a great sense of rock n roll there's no question about that. GO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
0345529057|5.0|Books are great, the only thing is that the maps are difficult to come back to when reading since they are right at the beginning of the books. Small font might be hard to read, personally i didn't miind it. Adding the Dance to these would be awesome.
B009YU62H2|5.0|After 20 years they still got it going on! They rock and they rock hard! Chirs Cornell still has a great voice after so many years.
B002RB7VMA|3.0|I LOVE Michael Buble but would have preferred an album where the style of most of the songs are similar. This jumps too much all over the genre spectrum for me. Although I really like his pop releases (e.g. Haven't Met You Yet, Hold On), I feel they kind of hold him back, the collaborations especially hold him back. I definately would not have bought this album if it had been full price.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|It might be a classic, and &#34;old&#34; book, but really interesting to learn about past times and a very particular society.<br />beautifully narrated by Jane Austin, in my opinion on of her best books. If you have never read a Jane Austin book this would be a good first book to introduce yourself in her world.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Any music of John Williams is great.  John Williams can always find the mood of the movie.<br />I thought he did an outstanding job on the sound track.
B005HHSXP0|4.0|I really like this author.<br />I think it is perfect to introduce kids and teenagers to the world of Greek/Roman mythology in a very entertaining way. And it is a very interesting book for adults as well.<br /><br />By giving a character to each God it makes you remember more about them (if you have studied them before) and you find yourself searching more information on mythology after reading it.
B0015AARJI|4.0|muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a
B000JQU4TW|5.0|If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app for my kindle hd everything is current and understandable and that is something at age 70+.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|It's Star Wars. I bought this as a gift, and the recipient was more than pleased. The best price I found
B007F7QG0Y|3.0|I've been a fan of the Stones since, well since before I knew they were the Stones. I was born in the early 70's so they were well established long before I came along. My first memories of them was when I was 5 or 6 years old, and my sisters would be listening to their record in their room. I would come crashing in and start lip syncing and dancing in a somewhat similar way to Jagger, only even more ridiculous and cartoonish. One sister would always laugh, while the other would grab a hair brush and brandishing it like a battle ax, would chase me out of the room like an angry Viking. Some of my best childhood memories are amusing and or infuriating my two older sisters, and I'm glad the Stones helped me do both.<br /><br />The other childhood memory I have with the Stones involves my older brother, who at the time, was the coolest guy. He drove a 1970 Olds 442, or a motorcycle and played bass guitar in a rock band. He's 6'5\\" so to me, he was as cool as Han Solo and as tall as Chewbacca. We would sit in the small utility room in the basement, because it had the best acoustics in the house, and I would listen to him practice playing Stones songs. My brother and the Stones taught me how to listen for the bass guitar in songs, which in my opinion, improves the overall enjoyment of the song, since the bass guitar sometimes get lost in the sound from the vocals and the other instruments. The bass is part of the spine of a song, so it's important and shouldn't be forgotten.<br /><br />The point of the two above paragraphs is so you are aware that the Stones are ingrained in my very psyche when it comes to music. When it came to the actual members of the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards was always my favorite. Jagger had the flair, but Richards had the cool, and for me that's would made the Stones what they were. So a couple of decades after the first time a did my annoying impression of Jagger, I come across this book and decide that it's time to come full circle and read it.<br /><br />I knew there had been a lot of drama among the members of the band, especially involving Mick and Keith, but that was all I knew really. I had always paid more attention to the music that the tabloids, but I thought if there was anyone's view I wanted to read about their history, it would be Keith's.<br /><br />The first couple dozen of pages are awesome, telling of a close call they had with the cops while they were doing a tour in the U.S. These pages are the bait to get you to buy the book, because that's what people do before they buy a book, right? They read the first couple of pages. That's what I did, anyway, and it worked with me.<br /><br />The next couple of hundred pages get pretty dry, and I'm talking text book dry. What helped me get through it was that it was a type of history lesson on how rock n roll was back when they first started. When they first started they didn't want to be a rock band, because back then rock = pop and pop wasn't cool. They wanted to be a blues band. I found that interesting along with the insight of how he learned to play guitar. You don't need to know how to play guitar to read this book, but it does help. I still ended up putting it down for a year or two, before finally getting back to it.<br /><br />Once the history lesson on rock and roll stops, you start getting insight into Richards, which makes for a more interesting read but also a more annoying one. What makes it annoying is Richards over inflated ego and the simple fact that he starts bending the truth or flat out lying.<br /><br />Sure, he's a rock star, so he is going to think he's hot stuff, it just comes with the territory, right? The thing is, I took that into consideration before I even opened the book up. By the time I got to the end of the book, I was sick of reading how he was usually not the toughest guy in the room, but regardless of who you are, if you got in a fight with him, you'd limp for the rest of your life. Yeah, whatever Keef, you skinny, little Brit. (Keef is his personally chosen nickname, which I found annoying, so I'm going to use it a whole bunch from here out. :)<br /><br />He also goes on to say how Jagger's solo work sucked, but his solo stuff was pretty good and he was quite happy with it. Can you name any songs from Jagger's or Richard's solo stuff? I can't. I vaguely remember listening to one of Richard's albums, thinking one song was pretty good but that the rest sounded like elevator music.<br />He even downplays his heroin addiction, saying he just did little doses to keep him going, never to zone out. Of course quitting the needle was a big horrible experience that he did a couple different times in his life, but the drug itself he never seems to admit to needing at any point in time.<br /><br />There were also times I was reading it and thought to myself, this is completely his side of the story only, no one else's, which I admit, didn't surprise me, but it was a disappointment. The thing that did surprise me, was while I was reading certain parts of the book, I kept thinking to myself, he's lying. I don't think this is how it happened at all. You know how sometimes, a person is telling you a story and you can just tell by their tone and body language that they are feeding you a complete line of bs? I actually got that feeling from reading this book in several places. If memory serves me right, I don't think Keef takes credit for discovering the five string technique with the guitar, but he does say he's the one that introduces to all the other big time names.<br /><br />By the time the book was over, not only was I glad (in a bad way) I ended up liking Keef considerably less than before I started reading. I'm glad I read it overall for the information it provided as well as a character study of Keef, but that is mainly as a resource for my own fiction writing. From the point of view from a Stones fan, it's kind of a toss up between what I learned and finding out I wouldn't want to have a pint with Keef. Ozzy's bio was way funnier and he doesn't have the rock star ego either, read it instead.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is free and so cool I rate this 5 stars because of how AWESOME and well AWESOME I already have the first temple run but this one is so much better than the first that is why I think it should be rated 5stars!!!!!!!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love everything about this case.  It rotates a little hard, but I'm sure with more use it will loosen up.  If you're looking for quality, this is the case for you.
B008C0C1Y8|3.0|While this film has some mediocre acting and terrible story line it has become a cult classic and a must add to any collection.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is one of the first games I got on my kindle, and to this day it is still my fav. The $2 cost is well worth it, I have hours in this game.
