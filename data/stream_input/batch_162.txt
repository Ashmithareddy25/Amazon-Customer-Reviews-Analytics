B00AFBXQNC|4|sudsy!
B001GN361U|4|This product is nothing fancy, but it does what it's supposed to do without any problems that I've found so far. Price was good as well. I recommend it.
B009DJLZQW|3|Works like it's supposed to initially.  I'll have to wait a while and see how it holds up before giving it any more kudos than that.  It was the cheapest one I could find, (way cheaper than a Honda replacement) so that was a plus.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Great sun shade. Sticks to my windows perfectly. Only wish they were a little bigger, which they may make them in a bigger size.
B000GVB17Y|5|as described and fast shipping
B00KCQSOAA|5|Love It! It fits great on my fiances 2013 Kia Rio. Was a little confusing how to strap everything but was very happy that it came with instructions!
B001UCEJHC|3|I didn't need this gasket for my 2008 Dodge Ram, The thermostat came with a rubber gasket and sealed my thermostat housing perfectly. This looks like the same gasket I used on my 97 Ram and seems to be of good quality. Now I have an extra if I need to work on my wife's Durango.
B006H823YK|1|Sent the wrong part didn't fit wrong size an even asked if it would fit before I Purchase it Was very disappointed
B000C0Y9EG|5|direct fit, no problems at all.&#34; works great &#34;
B000NOCBZK|1|Ordered 3 sets of 9 per set. Rec'd only 3. Sent in request for reorder or 21 more. Rec'd 3 (only) again. Not going to reorder.
B000924QO0|5|I use this product on my 1997 Camry and so far its been great.  It protects the paint from stains caused by bird crap.  I even used it on my headlights and so far it hasn't re-yellowed again.
B00FZS3XHO|5|Exactly as described
B00QWYO7XO|5|Great item
B003TDMCQA|4|great still where i put them just wish they were alil bigger
B0029XJVA6|5|I was a sceptic but needed something to clean my car windows and just keep in the car. I got this on a whim and am very glad I did! This works BETTER than traditional cleaner. I also used it on all of my mirrors and windows inside my house and it worked perfectly! I now have one I keep in my kitchen to get the window above the sink. I am forever a fan of microfiber now. If you have not tried it yet, DO! I am now using it in my commercial cleaning business. Very green! And microfiber lasts 3X or more longer than traditional rags.
B00480N18G|5|great, bright beam. Well focused, direct replacement for the fog lights on my Toyota. Very bright, long lasting.
B00429NKWK|5|Best headlight restoration kit I have used.
B003QUGPW8|5|I clean homes for a living (Love It); and have been using microfiber cloths for several years.  As I like to try new products for my profession, I have cleaned with several different types and brands.  This brand, in my opinion are by far the best ones I've ever used.<br /><br />Previously I used the Zwipes and had thought they were great until I tried these.  If you are a serious clean freak or a 'detail' person, or simply find yourself with a 'rag' in your hand a lot, you can't go wrong with these.<br /><br />Very seldom do I write reviews, but I just had to oooze about this one.
B00180UVGO|5|Works as well as expected. Easy installation. No more dangerous climb up into the box. Highly recommended. I've shown everyone I know this excellent accessory.
B004MU8VRS|5|I needed this to replace a broken faucet in my Motor home  shower. It fit perfect and installed easily. The quality was very good.
B000BYB2K2|3|Starting to smudge in less than a year. Not as bad as the larger one on the driver side which is doing poorly.
B0068C0EUA|5|Seems to be working just as it should.
B007Z2PTFW|5|Good for the job.
B009DJRRUA|5|it fit my toyota prius 2008
B008G2P0JA|5|Soooo clear
B00H07V3YS|5|BRIGHT!!!! I had a pair of Walmart Pilot LED's before I had flicker problems and decided to buy these. The light is actually white, not blue like the Pilot 6000k LED's and they are a lot brighter but not hard on the eyes.
B00860WLOY|4|The shipment didnt take long to get here. The only bad thing was that the gloves were to big so I sold them and got me some more.
B00IKL1Y3S|4|Came very quickly. I had to adjust the gap on two of the eight plugs as they were not within range.
B00679F0BC|4|great
B00EKKJE2G|5|RV use - battery savings is great, light color is good.
B00A93RXXA|5|I bought this for my Infiniti key.  Sure I could have bought an Infiniti key chain from the auto parts store and even from Amazon but how cool would a nismo key chain be to break the norm?  It looks great and I'm glad i made that decision.
B004GWZ0BC|5|It works great. A lot cheaper than purchasing it at the dealership or local parts store. It was easy to replace and only took a few minutes. I would purchase it again.
B001V3Z5NW|5|all my cars have aluminum trunks. So had to tape a chunk of metal (a saw blade) to the back of the car so this would stick.  Worked fine on my door panels.  Student driver hated the signs in general but they did help people be a bit more understanding in the early stages.
B00KOHHLTW|5|After reading all the reviews, I decided to try. The installation was easy, phone app works great, pairing was easy , choosing the correct map was easy and finally the sportser 1200C runs excellent, no back firing when deacceleraring. Excellent product!
B00B3O4AW6|5|Tool box looks better now !
B002Q1KPWY|1|Used for all of 20 minutes. Put a deer cart on the back of the quad with a small deer, maybe 130lbs. the bracket ended up bending right over at the lower tabs. the steel seems very lightweight on this..
B000CPJLGW|5|This is a great product.  You have to follow the direction on the can.  The first couple times the exhaust pipes got hot the paint gave off some fumes but that is to be expected.
B009IYV0JO|5|Works with heavy aftermarker spoiler/wing. Im a mechanic by trade and I recommend this if you need a replacement.
B00ARJR476|5|These coils were near identical to the ones that came stock on the Acadia. Perfect fit and work wonderfully. No more engine misfires now!
B00C6JV3Y0|5|Works great and I can now drive into my garage!!
B00C5TA2QQ|5|Cost is a little high, but it's made in the USA and works well.  It eliminated the rattle from my hitch.  Made from Stainless steel, I couldn't have made one for this price.
B003JJAUS6|5|Great fitting jacket and seems very well made like others have said. I'm adding my review mostly to give some sizing info. I'm 6'2 and 215 pounds, XXL worked perfect for me, and I have rather long arms. I wear a large shirt, but typically wear a 36 in length for dress shirts.<br /><br />Hope that helps.
B0031GYOGG|1|Terrible!  Picture has 2 blades and says twin and description says pack of one,  you figure one pair, but you would be wrong, very very wrong. You ONLY GET ONE BLADE!!!!!
B005DKIIJW|1|THIS CHARGER IS JUNK! GOT ONE, HOOKED IT UP AND NOTHING WORKED RIGHT! IT TOLD ME MY BATTERIES WERE FULL AFTER 20 MINUTES WHEN IN FACT THEY HAD LESS THAT 1/4 CHARGE!THE THING COULDN'T DETECT THE PROPER VOLTAGE AS IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO AND WAS OF NO HELP. BOXED IT UP,SENT IT BACK TO AMAZON.<br />AMAZON REFUNDED MY MONEY PROMPTLY! AMAZON TREATS BUYERS RIGHT! EBAY ON THE OTHER HAND IS A JOKE...I ONLY DEAL WITH AMAZON FROM NOW ON!!!!!!
B007W93MNY|5|Product is a great quality sticker works just like its supposed to and has the band which i love very much.  You couldnt ask for more. stick and peel, coming from a bi-polor weather town (El Paso, TX) the extream heats, wets, and colds are no problem for the mighty adhesive.  Awesome quality decals overall.
B000BQSW4E|5|met my expectations, nice
B000CLMQQS|5|I love it very much.
B001D75TG4|5|GREAT LOOKING UPGRADE THAT IMPROVES PERFORMANCE.
B005G5SQY6|5|Works great
B00079V5ZI|5|i looked at various hella twin horn setups (owned the set found in griot's catalog many years ago) before finding these. i made a quick visit to youtube to see if i could find sample sound bites of the hellas vs. these, which i did, and after listening to them decided to go with the piaa's.    like another reviewer, i chose the higher tone (500hz and 600hz) piaa's because to me they sound better, or more unique, than the lower tone ones, which sound like a stock american horn.    i installed these on a jeep wrangler, whose stock single factory horn is anemic and dangerous, since it can barely be heard. the piaa's come with very clear instructions for installation.  you simply match up one of 4 diagrams with your factory setup and then follow the simple steps in the instructions to wire them up.     you do not need a relay to install these. i did have to tap into my existing positive and negative factory horn wires, since i was going from one stock horn to dual horns. piaa provided the extra wiring to do this and the quality of the wiring and spade ends is excellent. i did have to go buy two female spade bits for the ends of the factory wires, since i had to cut those off the factory harness. crimping on new spade ends was not hard at all. the whole install took about 15 minutes and the dual horns fit perfectly in the stock location.    i am very, very satisfied with the piaa sports horns, in terms of both loudness and quality of the sound. i was a little skeptical because of their low price, but they really do deliver, and i think they are better than the more expensive hellas. they seem well-made and combined with the great instructions, i don't see how you can go wrong. highly recommend.
B0028JW4PU|3|We've just bought a house and I'm loving having a garage for the first time since going off to college. I've been getting after all of those deferred maintenance issues we let slide while living in apartments. So the jack is getting regular use and I'm happy with it. But, it could use some improvements.<br /><br />The handle grip is way loose. It spins around and comes off all of the time. I'm gonna have to find a replacement. Maybe a bicycle handle will fit?<br /><br />There is no other handle on the jack so unless you want to push/roll it everywhere you need to lift it by the handle. But that's a funny angle for your wrist and, again, the grip comes right off. I wish it had some kind of grab bar on one end or a side. Another thing to figure out how to rig.<br /><br />It takes a lot of pumps to get it up to my stock jeep's frame.<br /><br />The main thing I don't like is that to lower it you have to remove the handle and slide it over a little tab next to the handle which has to be twisted to lower it and twisted back to stop it lowering or allow you to raise it again. And then you have to reinsert the handle to pull it from under the car. And then the grip comes off when you pull it. It's just kind of a fiddly operation getting it on that little tab.<br /><br />My brother has a similar style jack. I don't remember the brand. It takes fewer pumps to raise. And lowering it just requires twisting the handle to the left. I guess I just assumed that all of these jacks worked like that. I really, really wish this jack worked like that.
B001CMRVF2|4|This is second one.  First lasted about three years.  Otherwise works as advertised, just needed slight mod to fit distributor (conflict with screw head).
B00230DQVA|1|Long stem as I was looking for, but the mirrors do not seem to be in there well - time will tell how they hold up.<br /><br />Update: I cannot recommend these after further use.<br />The good news is the stem is longer than the stock ones on my 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca.<br /><br />However, once you get up past about 50 MPH, the image in the mirror is almost useless - especially at night.
B000GVF88W|5|Worked perfectly.
B00684TCWY|5|I did not pay closes attention when ordering this remote, it works great with my Altima. I need some help with programing the staff was very helpful and walk me right thew and programing. I would buy from them aging.
B006JPEAAQ|5|Excellent case at an unbeatable price. This case has enough room for 2 helmets or 2 12 packs inside. Comes with a universal mounting bracket, so there is some level of install and possibly customization needed depending on your bike. Installation is simple and quick as long as you have a few tools and 20 minutes. The case seems sturdy and has plenty of room. You can't beat the price on this especially with the mount included.
B00VLF5CII|4|Great piece
B000E7SY16|5|I bought these to throw in my truck for whatever. Not the highest quality cords on the market but they were cheap and exactly what I was looking for.
B001KQD7XA|4|did not come with replacement glass hardware screw; was a pain to reuse. otherwise great<br />fit was like original, not hard to install at all
B004WO5CQW|4|Hi, I live in Montreal, Canada. This part definitely saves money because at the dealer or even at auto shops like MIDAS they tell you the whole driveshaft must be replaced - with labor and taxes close to $1000. The quality seems good. I have had it installed on my Jeep Liberty for about a week now and drove about 200km, so far all is good.  Note the following:   1. Import fees into Canada are $52 (as of Dec. 2011), so add that to the advertised price.   2. The driveshaft with the new joint may need re-balancing on a machine that only driveshaft specialist shops have.  This was my experience with this part:  - The old CV joint boot got damaged  - I read some good posts about this part on the Jeep forums so ordered it  - It was delivered exactly when it was estimated on Amazon, but unfortunately the seller did not inform Amazon they shipped the part so I did not know it was coming, and had no tracking number.  - Removing the 12 bolts (6 on each end of the driveshaft) was easy (surprising they were not seized after 10.5 years/196,000km)    Some long extensions were needed on the ratchet to reach the bolts easily. (I raised the vehicle on a jackstand).  - Getting the driveshaft out from the companion flange on the transfer case was not as easy - had to put lots of WD40 and gently hammer it with a screwdriver before the shaft would move and let itself be compressed towards the front differential so I can take it out.  - It was not as easy to remove the old CV joint as it might seem from the video on the website of Driveshaft Parts, the dust cover is very tight. Lacking other ideas, I hammered a flat screwdriver through the dust cover and by turning it inside and repeating this maneuver I was able to loosen (and destroy...) the dust cover and get it out.  - Then found that the snap ring is hard to get out without a special tool - I fought with it for more than 30 minutes with some regular sharp-tip pliers.  - After removing the old one, installing the new CV joint onto the shaft was really easy (messy though because of the grease!), but putting the shaft back into place on the car is a different matter. I was not able to do that, the dust cover just would not fit all the way into the companion flange at the transfer case. It just would not go all the way in so the bolts could not reach the threads (they were very close though). Also I could not properly tighten the metal collar on the boot - but maybe I am just not good at improvising, or there is a special tool needed.  - I removed the driveshaft, put ziploc bags on the companion flanges and taped over it with duct tape so I could at least drive in 2WD.  - Went to a local driveshaft specialist (Mr. Driveshaft in Montreal/Lasalle) and they were able to install it - they said the part was ok but apparently they used a certain \\"technique\\" and I think they were also able to raise the car more so had more room to maneuver the shaft. They also set the metal collar on the boot properly. Probably someone more skilled/experienced than me could do install everything by themselves. Several other Jeep owners posted on the Jeep forums they were able to do this by themselves.  - As I had read some more posts on the Jeep forums, I was concerned about the shaft not being balanced any more (which may lead to vibration) so I asked the guys at Mr. Driveshaft to rebalance it as they installed it. I can see they welded some small weight on the side of the shaft. They charged me $100 for installing and rebalancing.  - The new joint felt a lot tighter than the original one (much harder to move it by hand). I emailed Driveshaft Parts and they responded quite promptly. They said it is normal as the part was new, and so did the guys at Mr. Driveshaft.  Note that Mr. Driveshaft also has a similar CV joint part in stock - which they believed to be of better quality than this one. They said in most cases they can do the whole replacement for $290 (CAN). In retrospect, I wish I had researched the local shops abit more before ordering the part online. In the end it cost me  $230 for the part, customs fees and installation/balancing, and spent almost one night working on it myself. I wish I'd just known before that Mr. Driveshaft   did this too, and also about the customs charge.  Hope this review is helpful to other Jeep owners who wish to save some money and not pay the full driveshaft price.
B008C8W9U6|1|lasted 1 day then blow out. high was low , low was high.
B008C8TQ2K|5|I bought this inner tube for my mobility scooter.  It was easy to install and is holding up just fine (so far)!
B007NGBGL6|4|g00d
B004RCP548|5|I've been wanting to replace the fabric on our Carefree of Colorado awning for a couple of years now, but I worried it'd be a difficult and expensive job.  I decided to take the plunge this week when staying in our travel trailer at a friend's home and I was disgusted at the appearance and condition of our awning fabric when I rolled it out.<br /><br />I could hardly believe I could order a genuine Carefree of Colorado replacement fabric here on Amazon for about the same price anywhere else on the Internet AND have it delivered via next day air for only $3.99 using Prime shipping!  It arrived the next day as promised rolled up and sealed in a large heavy-wall cardboard roll tube.<br /><br />My wife and I prepped, removed the old fabric, and installed the new fabric in about 2 hours by carefully following the instructions found in the Carefree of Colorado service manual for our awning which can be found on their website.  There was no need to remove the awning from the travel trailer.  Note that fabric replacement  instructions were NOT included with our shipment.<br /><br />Removal of the old fabric is an easy 2 person job.  Installation is a bit tougher, but still relatively easy if you're physically fit and able to repeatedly climb a ladder.  You'll need two step ladders and 4 people to make the installation go smoothly.  2 people are needed to pull the fabric into the mounting channels (one on the awning roller tube and one up at the mounting channel on the travel trailer) and 2 other people assisting to guide the fabric into the channel openings.  This may sound vague or confusing without seeing it done, but it'll be obvious when the time comes.  YouTube has some videos of awning replacements that might also be helpful.<br /><br />The new fabric and valance fit and look beautiful.  The new material seems like it might be slightly thicker than that the original fabric.  We're very pleased.
B009ES3F0Q|5|Nice, high quality sealed units that are incredibly bright. Crisp, white LED lighting. More of a general spread of light than a focused beam, but very intense.
B000PL0CTI|5|This ones really unleash power on my engine MPG also reduced a winner!!! fast accel nice quality from bosch love it
B006A6NDG6|2|I am SO MAD (being polite)  This was a gift..We were fine with their return addy on the envelope..But NO..Mr EGO..Just had to put another sticker on the back..team lotus..Harley davidson...Surprise ..Out the window..True an inexpensive gift but just the same..Some common sense here..Its holiday time...Havent opened it as still thinking of sending it back...So if you cant be there to grab the package..I WOULD NOT order from these people.Lesson learned
B000ELQO50|5|Awesome saved a lot by getting it on amazon!
B000MJXQ64|5|Nice add on to the power probe
B009D3FPSM|5|I bought this one to untighten the axle of my Buell xb12ss which is a 22.<br />This Axle Tool is easy to use. Attach it to a 3/8 wrench and start working.
B004JO3VQI|5|Very happy to receive these mats for our recently purchased 2012 Tiguan. Previous cars have had them and it is hard to live without them in the Midwest winter.  We could have purchased them at the dealership but they were sold out.  The price was good on Amazon and shipment was fast! Great purchase.
B001HQLZ46|5|This is an excellent kit which includes all parts needed to tune up an S-10. Plugs were all gapped to specifications and wire all were of the correct length. The kit included 2 extra wires as I believe this is the same kit use for an 8 cylinder engine. It took some effort to get several wires to snap into place as the connectors were very tight. It pays to test fit using an old plug and distributor cap as it is much easier to snap these connections into place off the vechicle. This will open the connectors enough to make the on vehicle connection much easier. New screws are included for the cap and rotor and it is advisable to use a magnetic tip driver as these screw are NOT held captive and can fall into the distributor. After installation my truck ran much better, particularly at idle and under 1000 RPM. I didn't notice any mileage improvements though.
B005G9Y11E|5|Great!<br />Luke
B004BTMAVI|5|it did the job
B0024MIUV8|4|I like the look and feel of my Shoei, but screws have vibrated out of the modular part of the helmet.  Please put some Loctite on the tips of the screws.  They vibrate out and I can't find a source for replacement so an expensive helmet becomes a 10 dollar helmet.  With irritation of parts falling off riding.  I should have bought a cheaper helmet then I wouldn't expect quality.
B00C7FO78C|5|Great quality for the price
B002UC8ORW|5|There's not much to say about this other than it's exactly like the one  we needed to replace and the prices was right.
B005H2SHS8|5|JhM Motorsports who is the authority on Making big power in Audis sells this oil as a change kit. So if thats what they are using I guess thats what I am using. Just put in 9.5 liters in my 4.2 powered audi s4 along with a hengst filter. Super easy to do. For 80 bucks and free oil disposal using my city furbished oil change containers. Cant beat that. Also the lubro container has a cool spout.
B0007ZL174|5|I was not sure it this was the correct vent lid to replace the original broken lid.  I looked at pictures and compared them to my old one and it looked the same from what I could see.  It was the exact same and was fairly easy to change out.  Ventline is apparently a very common brand used on box trailers.
B00GKTZAHS|1|These are going straight into the garbage!  Look like they were printed from a home printer that was low on ink.  Inconsistent borders white background showing on one side. The blue line isn't even centered on the sticker.  Two of them had huge scratches on them.  I will never order from this seller again.  Waste of money
B007L2JNJ4|5|Mirrors arrived very quickly after ordering and they fit perfectly as described, very snug with little vibration when driving. Good visibility when towing. Would recommend this product to my friends.
B009AA2J0U|5|Direct factory replacement. Why pay $250 at the Chevy dealer or $100 at the parts store! No code reset necessary. Perfect fix in less than 15 minutes!!
B000JW3EDO|5|This is a great high quality product at the best price around. Fit perfectly on the vehicle. Toughest part was not installing the hitch, but exercising the bolt holes prior to installing the hitch. From years of non-use, they became somewhat corroded. Even for a vehicle that was garaged.
B003ZU8J3C|3|I drive hundreds of miles daily, so having a good foglight is important in Michigan winters.  After both of my factory foglights broke, I looked to replace them. These worked great for about a month. Now one doesn't work...... but it could be due to driving in extreme cold, the lights get hot, and cold spray on them will obviously be no good..........  I notice many Dodge trucks driving with a foglight out.......  Doesn't anybody make a light that will stand up? (Probably not at this price)  I guess you get what you pay for.
B002YU8ENO|3|The brackets themselves mount nice and easily... But they should not be advertised as &#34;windshield on.windshield off&#34; as they do not look complete without a windshield, and the windshield LOCK takes a bit of effort to use.  I wish that Memphis Shades had a system that went with my Victory..
B008ZDYLC2|3|The unit does what it is supposed to, but without support for extended PID's. Dedicated scan tools that read the extended data costs over $1000. I went with a Bluetooth adapter and Android software, which will read enhanced data at a price that's less than this scan tool. Scan tool manufacturers need to offer extended data capability at reasonable prices, or Smart phones will take the market lead.
B000EA5WLS|5|Worked great
B00IZCNOXK|3|This is a nice grill and reasonably priced. The materials appear more durable that some and therefore it is slightly heavier. It could however have a different control valve that would give better control of the flame intensity. The upper grill grate (bun warmer) could be made removable to give better access to the back of the main grate, but if only cooking for a couple people this is not a big deal.<br />The info provided leads you to believe there is provided, a bracket to hang the BBQ on the side of a Motorhome or Trailer. It doesn't explain that this bracket is the one the BBQ hangs on and not what is fastened to the Motorhome or Trailer to hang that bracket on. They tell you to hang this bracket on the inset molding on the side of your RV. This would be fine if all RV's had this molding installed at the same height. As in my case I have two RV Trailers and one has no molding at all and the other is 37&#34; off the ground which would put the grill grate surface about 30&#34; off the ground. This would be fine if you are on your knees or sit in a lawn chair while grilling your food. It would be very easy to provide a piece of molding  about 24&#34; long to mount to the side of the RV. Also if you could use the molding on your RV you would have to remove the rubber or vinyl screw cover molding insert in order to hang the BBQ bracket on the molding. This would be unsightly. I also feel it would be better if the price was increased to include everything needed to mount and use this BBQ.<br />And we are told that this BBQ can &#34;only&#34; be used when connected to the onboard RV propane system. This is misleading because if you purchase a BBQ regulator, a female quick connect and an adapter fitting this can be used with any portable propane tank. This is a much easier setup if you plan on using it on a table top away from your RV. This also could be solved by installing a gas regulator on the BBQ.
B00AMPPDKK|4|The one knock I have for this part is that the painted insert on the rear of the unit, which comes in black, is not interchangeable with the insert from the original OEM part. SO, if you have painted inserts on your mirrors and want to keep the look, you'll either be stuck with parts that don't exactly fit, or a bill for a minor paint job
B00E0NSL54|4|It does a good job
B0013ENVP8|3|This is a little less durable than what I had expected, but then, it wasn't expensive. It arrived on time.
B002NUTQZ0|5|This is Awesome stuff,  It works miracles...I don't know how it works but it was like driving a new car after we put this in our vehicle,  It took only a short distance of driving for the &#34;Miracle&#34; to work......Highly recommend trying this before expensive transmission shop repairs.....
B00MAPJZTA|5|Great product. Awesome value. Works as expected
B002EW5FWU|5|NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING!!!  I just finished cleaning my RV and this took all the bugs off with very little effort.  I sprayed it on and then used the Camco 43633 Wash Brush with Adjustable Handle to lightly brush off the bugs.  I put no pressure on the brush, just rubbed it around.  I then turned on the water and rinsed it off to a perfectly white RV!
B00DFKKTYE|5|These made my 2004 Jeep Wrangler look more like a beast and there is no hood flapping at all. I love them!
B000IYNVEU|5|I have a 2003 acura tl. Needed a radiator cooling fan (drivers side fan on radiator). Was exactly what i needed and fit perfectly. Very happy<br />Tip: Some websites confuse the radiator cooling fan w the ac condensor fan. Make sure you compare the pic w the fan you need. The picture here helped me purchase the right fan.
B004L035UW|4|a good product. good quality
B000YQKOU6|5|Good product and great seller. Will use again
B001DKQZ9Q|1|A year or so ago, I would have recommended these to anyone. They are cheap and worked. But something changed recently. I have had 1 completely defective unit (made a huge mess and did not pump at all), and another quit working after a quart or so. Two bad units in a row is indicative of a problem. I wont be using these anymore.
B0054HNQ32|5|Great Quality and does as advertised.  Also, easy to use and install.  Very pleased with this product overall, and very satisfied with performance so far.
B000VKTUJQ|5|Jiffy Lube tried to charge me triple on this. Thanks for a great product at a great price. Good Sfuff!!!!!
B0002SQYUA|5|Like it!
B000WK4EU0|5|Works as expected and I do store it outside of the case to let it dry.
B001U04MYE|2|Power rating is wrong.  Could not charge my 65W laptop.  I recommend the Bestek 300 W inverter.  This would work well for cell phones and such.
B00KY0B2LM|5|Shipped quickly had it in about a 1 1/2 days. Seems to work great, haven't had any problems with the electrical in it was installed 2 weeks ago.
B009CBH1EQ|2|Does this item work or do its job?  The anser is yes but it does it oh so poorly.<br /><br />It is able to find a freon leak as long as the probe is directly taking a bath in the gas.<br /><br />My example is this:  Turned to full sensitivity it did not see anything wrong with a valve that may be reponsible for leaking freon at a rate of one pound of gas per day till the probe was stuck full into the valve. IT DID NOT find any leak if the probe left the port (amounting to less than a 1/4 inch from a possible leak.  I can say that it was very good at finding a leak from a freon tank once I opened the valve on the tank and allowed the gas to blow directly into the probe but if I moved it a slight distance out of the path.. NOTHING.  I It might also prove to be a good childrens toy since my kids like the &#34;ticking&#34; noise it makes.<br /><br />I cannot say that this item is worse than comprable tools (price) but it is not in the same league as a professional item that I have used.
B0023W95C2|5|Installed these on a black 2009 Trailblazer SS, they look great, seem to be high quality, and were completely plug and play. Was impossible to find pics of these installed on a Trailblazer prior to ordering but they are exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />My only very small complaint is I wish the backup light area wasn't so bright and large, but its probably to comply with some DOT regulation.
B00CG5RYEW|5|Boght these to give to my buddy's! They love them !
B00CJOIQGA|5|Work well and add touch of class to interior. Not to buckley lay flat and comfortable not distraction while driving
B000JFJLP6|5|I bought this for my fiance for Valentine's Day. Some say I'm an odd gift giver, but I just like to give things that are useful. This has been sooooo useful. I bought it so he could take it with us when we go out on the boat. We have helped at least 8 people jump their boats off (haven't had to jump ours yet, thank goodness), and it does it with no problem. Starts 'em right up. We also used it to jump our lawnmower off one time. Great purchase. He loves it...almost as much as his fogless shower mirror ;-)
B0032750TO|5|These auto mats are a 5 star plus! I hesitated spending the money but after I put them in my van, it was a &#34;no- brainer decision&#34; if I had to do it again! My 5 year old van looks new again after traveling with 3 teenage boys, 3 dogs, many baseball games, summer vacations and the worst Ohio winter in a long time!  They honestly look better than the factory installed mats minus the &#34;Town and Country&#34; logo.  I ordered on a Sunday evening, had a confirmation email on Monday and mats delivered by Wednesday!  I highly recommend this company and these mats!
B00230JZW4|3|Nice cable, but the jam nut is pretty cheezy. It barely caught any threads when tightened and ended up pulling off on second use. Had to put original nut back on.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Arrived on time, works as advertised, charged a Blue top that conventional charger would not.
B000C6KKES|5|Got the car to run a little healthier now with the new air filter.  It does a good job as expected.  It's mechanic recommended so I can't go wrong.  Good job Purolator!
B00H7LPKKU|5|Fantastic product.  Makes a tight seal, no leaks, no mess. Grease goes where it should and not in your garage floor or yourself.  Easy to attach to any standard grease gun.  Attached mine to an 8 inch flex hose to get into hard to reach places.  It's pricey but with every penny.
B005RZARXS|5|Perfect headlight
B000W1QZPG|5|Yep, this inexpensive and very simple air chuck is the best I have found and I've tried a lot of different ones. The problem is the fancy clip on kind start leaking of take too much space to clip on in tight wheel fits. This chuck is simple and the design has been around a long time and it works!
B00IIWMAB4|5|Great price
B009TYMXC6|4|it fits perfect, but the boot thickness can be a little thinner it makes the lighter pop-out on my motorcycle.
B00EBEV4OW|4|Purchased as a gift, he loved the idea of a fridge in his room. Used it as soon as he opened it couldn't wait to put his coke in it.
B004ULR5FI|5|Awesome stuff.
B001KS6FPA|3|Based on other reviews, I knew this fit my 2008  Honda Fit. I had no trouble removing the old assembly and getting the new one into position for locking in. However, the two plastic nubs that match up with the grooves on the wiper arm both broke off when I was snapping the new assembly into place. I know Everything was lined up perfectly, because I had to remove the broken pieces from the grooves. Fortunately, I was able to remove the blade itself and wriggle it into the old assembly.
B00DBENCZC|5|its awesome easy to install on 2008 honda civic ex COUPe the only hard time it gives me is pulling the factory light so hard to take it off but after that its easy just pop it back in to the socket and boom its all install
B00A3U8SEM|5|Great buy. Was Leary about ordering mail order electronic parts but we're OEM .
B0000AY2Z6|4|I like the size and volume of this fan, but I havent got to use it in high heat conditions yet.  Intended use is to cool a dog kennel in the back of my enclosed truck - with air flow.
B00FRJH5WU|5|Works great for the bike rack on my corolla
B002YXC07W|5|I didn't use the lube plate on my 5th wheel because my RV dealer recommended that i don't use one with my Pull-rite hitch. Probably should have asked them first before I purchased it. The lube plate did seem to be manufactured quite well so my rating is based on my perceived quality of the item.
B003YMTJ2G|5|shipped fine. fit 2007 tsx fine.  mechanic was surprised acdelco is now made in china.<br /><br />driving for a week now. no complaints. would buy again
B000BPOIB6|1|These were rated as the best to use. I have tried all of the &#34;Best rated&#34; on all of my vehicles. I had high hopes for these based on ratings. I am very particular of what I buy for my vehicles. These have only lased 20,000 miles, same as the rest of &#34;Best rated&#34; plugs. I end up going back to factory plugs,,,,, well I actually use Auto craft plugs in my GM vehicles. Don't laugh they go and last a good 50K miles for 1/2 the price. If you like spending time under your hood instead of driving, keep buying &#34;Best rated&#34; plugs. No more for me....
B001IH8Q0A|4|Fits as it should.  Converts Class II 1.25 inch receiver to a full 2 inch receiver.  Be advised that the hitch pin on the smaller side is a smaller diameter than the one on the 2 inch so you may want to find a locking pin for it.  I don't tow with it, I just use it to haul a cargo carrier.  I bolted the small side with a lock washer and performed fine for a 1,000 miles.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is a little long.  The 2 inch side could be offered in different sizes, but each application is going to be different.
B0079XC0Y0|4|I got this as a gift for my dad and he loves it! He loves that it's heated and so portable as well as strong enough to get the kinks out of his lower back. It's not a shiatsu like I thought it was but the vibrations are strong enough to ease back pain until you can get to a chiropractor
B006XG6L08|5|that's my second set.. I sold first bike.. This lamps give my HD Electra CVO (2004 cobalt/black) that stylish design .. install with HID bulbs look awesome..
B000KQK6XU|5|That's what my PT Cruiser reminds me of since adding these cool magnets to the other stickers already on it.<br /><br />I've gotten positive remarks from others as well. Not just on these, but the entire Hippy Van concept. :)<br /><br />These seem well made and look really nice.
B005RNGN8I|4|Worked perfectly! Thanks
B0073WEZU4|1|Does not work at all on my 2012 ford f150.  Cravenspeeds response: return it. Thanks for the junk.  I'd give 0 stars if I cud
B00267PZUK|5|Well, I bought this broken spark plug remover after a couple broke in my 2006 Ford Explorer with 4.6 triton V-8. I watched a couple videos on Youtube and read the directions carefully and removed the broken plugs. It works as advertised, just take your time and watch some videos online. This tool saved me several hundred dollars. The dealer wanted $800 per cylinder head...they were rude and short with me too. I'm glad Lisle makes this tool..like I said, it saved me several hundred dollars!<br /><br />Adrian<br />Bel Air, MD
B0083LH5F6|5|they fit fine...they look better than the floppy kind..I like em.<br /><br />These are better than the rubber floppy kind of mud flap ..I imagine the flexible rubber type work in a place that does not get snow..the problem is when you back up into a snow bank they get pushed against the wheel and get torn off...
B00068OQGA|5|I couldn't be happier with how my LS5 runs now. My Edelbrock carburetor was a little bit lean, so I used the Edelbrock carb/jet chart to determine which metering jets to install. I ordered them, installed them (took about 20 minutes) and the car runs great.
B004J0WJFG|1|Don't waste your time or money!!! Should of went to Advanced Auto and paid the 386.00 After 2 weeks of being stranded and trying to get home I was sent poorly packaged radiators 2x and they were useless! I am still stranded waiting to get one paid and installed out the door on Friday for $789.00 I wish i did this from beginning! I would of be home and I wouldn't of been out of work for an extra week. This is the most expensive Radiator in the world! DON'T BUY NOTHING from PRIME CHOICE AUTO PARTS! Its a waste of time and money! if you do make sure it's not something breakable and if its solid make sure you find all the pieces that come with it. The boxes are so cheap you will lose any attachment or nuts and bolts that come with it! Good LUCK!
B00EPLI7ZK|5|I used these 921 compatible base bulbs for my RV. I choose them because they had more than the number of lumens that the original incandescent bulbs they replaced, so I would not even have to think about if the lighting was getting darker. The goal was to cut the amount of power used so that I could go dry camping (battery only).<br /><br />Using LED bulbs in the RV cuts the power consumption by a huge amount. Further, using LEDs in a 12 volt lighting system is actually far MORE efficient than a 120v LED bulb. The reason is that those bulbs have to carry their own power conversion circuits in the base, and that is what is consuming a lot of the power. That is why for 120v applications, LED bulbs consume about the same power as compact florescent bulbs. However, a 12v light does not need conversion, and so does not waste power in the conversion, just power to light.<br /><br />The difference is black and white. Using LED bulbs is really required before dry camping. In addition, the 921 incandecents ran so hot that they actually warp their plastic fixtures. These bulbs do not do that at all, they run cool.<br /><br />Out of the original lot of about 16 bulbs, I had one that failed after a few weeks. Since LEDs don't really age like normal bulbs, I expect the rest to last longer than I do (at 50 years of age).<br /><br />In short, full lumens, you pay extra for that, and in exchange you never replace the bulbs and they run cool and don't drain your battery.
B00CQ40KVM|2|For the price not bad. Too small for the Chevy Equinox even though it said it would fit. Will have to purchase the mats directly through Chevrolet
B002P33KVQ|5|Used it for my cabin set up, works as described, what a great little way to have running water from my rainwater catchment system.
B00296CJB6|5|fast and cheap
B007Y5W9RG|5|The fuel petcock repair kit I ordered was excellent and took care of the problem I had with the factory originals leaking.
B009DK6M5K|4|Not a perfect fit, but it works after a little heat from my heat gun.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Use it on my motorcycle's battery tender hook up to charge my phone on the road.
B001FJDAZC|5|Fit perfectly, works great.
B005S09XUA|5|Terrific product - looks like my 2013 Pilot Touring came with them from the factory.  Easy to install (myself) and we've had an 18 cubic foot carrier on them a few times this summer, hauling golf clubs and beach gear among other things - not a hitch.  Highly recommended!
B006CV6PBO|4|good but no way of locking it on<br />would have been nice to have this in the description , but still nice
B004UPZXI0|5|Simply...  I absolutely love it!!  Please, do yourself a favor and buy it!
B000CNAVJA|3|They should give more grease. Cost me another $150 for labor to replace these bushings.
B00236M5KW|3|This item was returned because it could not be worn with a helmet.  The googles themselves appeared to be of relatively good quality but they were too large to be worn over glasses while wearing a helmet.
B005UYU894|5|This battery arrived quickly by priority mail. Has been working fine for a month and the price was around half of what I could find locally. Am very pleased so far.
B000T8UG52|5|I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  It was exactly what he wanted. He has used it several times already and is very satisfied with it.
B0018LMSG4|5|Great bushings that were easy to install. No steering slop at all now. About a third of the price as OEM replacement rubber ones too.
B00H3YBUUA|1|We have had the driest winter ever,( actually called an extreme drought), yet this P.O.S. Car Capsule is full of water. Rusty brake rotors,  all of the underhood aluminum that I bead blasted is covered in white corrosion and the canvas top is covered with mold inside. The car was waxed and dried and stored with the windows cracked as per the instructions. They claim that the air circulation keeps it dry, but it seems that due to the design, the moisture gets inside and can't escape. There isn't really a way for he air to blow thru. My other car was parked on a car trailer with a cover on it and I'd perfectly fine.<br />[url=[...]]<br />[url=[...]][url=[...]]<br />[url=[...][...]]<br /><br />[URL=[...][...]]
B007UHPSCG|5|worked perfect, arrived when it  was promised
B004CUXOIO|5|Great buy.
B00SOUUQ3Y|5|When I was looking at this product I currently had the stock cross bars on my 2009 Ford Escape. I always drive in very windy areas and with the stock bars my kayak would move quite a bit and the bars themselves would bend. Needless to say it made me nervous. I saw these and notice the 165lb rating. They also said they would fit on my Escape. I got them in less then a week. They come with extra padding but I did not need them. The installation was very easy. They just slid on and tightened right up. I have been using them for about a week now and I have had no problems at all. Even when I get behind a big truck, the kayaks barely move, which makes me feel a lot better. I am very happy with these bars and suggest if you have the stock bars on your vehicle you should look into buying these.
B00K7YI5P6|4|UPDATE:  I have had this bag for over a year and a half and it still works great.  The clear plastic has not yellowed.  As for the functionality:  It is a  small, velcro closure, case.  It won't fit my baseball hat.  Just sunglasses and some Tic-tacs, maybe.  The clear outside case barely holds my Moto G phone, vertically.  Next, the straps are just sewn on 1ft. long strips of hook and loop tape.  I'm not sure how long the straps will stay sewn onto the pouch.  Finally, to be sure, this is NOT leather, it is Naugahyde.  Overall, this is an overpriced pouch with not much functionality.
B00C2SUDMS|1|Too expensive for 2 prices of metal
B005GI08B2|5|I couldn't be any happier with my purchase!  More than satisfied!  I highly recommend them, especially if you have kids.  They fit PERFECTLY, do not stink, and do not shift around like previous floor mats.  You will not be disappointed!
B009T97NBW|5|I was a little skeptical about these mats, but they are better than expected. I am very picky about what I put in my car and these work well all year round....and look great too. Lastly, they fit like a glove...love them!
B0002SQYTG|5|Extremely well made but easily carried, (Shirt pocket or glove box)! Highly accurate classic design that has been proven over a loooong time. Extremely good price and extremely accurate. You can't go wrong with this really handy little gadget!
B007PVIARW|5|Great product!!
B00EJ95Y04|5|Looks great on my fog lights, excellent product will recommend also note there are two layers so make sure you peel the outer film off too it will make it a lot easier to apply to curved surfaces especially when heating it up
B0027FYBNI|5|Moved into an office where a smoker had been -- this really helped with the smell until we got it professionally cleaned.
B00C7Y8LGW|4|It fits my 2004 Chevy Colorado Tailgate perfectly.  So far no problems with it working.
B004C26TD4|5|a great device, works real good I'm happy with it.
B00DPNBXHI|4|Received as described and as scheduled.
B0085QDNS2|5|i purchased this product due to the type and style.. and it came in perfect condition and looks very cool and it is confortable to drive...
B002659W0Q|1|The description of the product was not what I received. I bought this thinking I will receive a complete White lens unit with a bulb etc. instead I just received a plastic cap! Very disappointing... I doubt will do business again with this company.
B000637TNM|5|Works great for leather. Makes it nice and supple while not leaving it too shiny. You may notice a slight darkening of the leather after applying.
B003SER3XW|4|Don't remember where I bought mine. But, at least I can give my experience on using these.<br /><br />Helicoils are ok to use & may be faster to use than Time-Sert. But the TIme-Sert are a much, much better tread replacement! They come in a lot of different sizes to cover a wide area of treads. Granted, might be expensive to buy it all to be fully covered. But, you can at least get the ones that are common for your use of area.<br /><br />But since I use this set for drain plugs on oil pans. I'll stick with that. It provided a better alternative than replacing the pan & cheaper to do. Kit comes with everything you need to do the job. Expect the tools to use on the tools.<br />The tricky part of using this though (why I gave it a 4 star). Is drilling/treading the hole straight. You just have that chance of it not being straight. Even if it looks like you are. Might be just a slight angle on the pan that I don't notice.<br /><br />Though, the set comes with a sleeve to help keep it straight while drilling/treading. And I do use it. It still tends to happen. Which leaves you with ether forcing the sert to be screw in more than you should. Or applying a good quality RTV to the sert before screwing it in. Because, if you don't, you'll still end up with a leaking drain plug.<br /><br />Though I might have trouble with it at times. I would still recommend using Time-Sert instead of a helicoil.<br />Just remember to get the right time-sert's for the job you are doing. They come in different material (as in, carbon, stainless steel, cooper I believe, etc). Each one if for a different purpose of where you are using it (if it going to be in contact with chemicals, like oil, coolant, etc).
B000066OC7|3|It slides to easy. It needs to be secured.
B003SWNVI0|4|Works very well. Drove over 300 miles at 70 mph never needed retightened. Every once in a while you'd hear a flapping noise. No complaints here.
B00BZOGNEM|5|GREAT, use in my Diesel tractor aluminum radiator
B00REKZHSO|4|The noise the switch makes when you turn the blinkers or warning lights on is very loud compaired to the stock one. The stock switch from audi is $100 plus dollars in my area. I can stand to listen to a little clicking comparing the two prices
B00KY58CN8|5|These are great attention and conversation starters. Everyone comments on them when they walk past my car.
B00AAQNW2C|5|I'm rating this product based on the fact that it arrived at the appointed date and that everything looks as advertised.  The reason I bought this product is in case I find myself in the need to use it.
B004YHR6RU|4|The coveres make the car look almost new inside. And it fits pretty well too. I may look for the back covers next.
B0016LEAYO|3|It does an okay job of cleaning windows in the car, and doesn't leave as much of a residue as say Windex would. However there is a much better and cheaper plant based cleaner on the market sold by Pledge and is readily available. I won't be ordering this product again.
B0060LTPM2|1|Harnesses do not fit stock lighting bulbs.  They pop out before they lock In, size appears too small for a full bulk base to fit into.  Not worth the hassle, I would return it but it took me a long time to get these put in.
B00480FIEG|3|Slight brighter and whiter than average bulbs.
B0066IUDSY|5|Kept my windshield clear and worked well until I got my heater fixed, was a real life saver !
B007RSPDSW|5|Arrived on time and easy to apply. Since it's a Honda product, it matches my paint perfectly. A must have to touch up the little nicks and scratches that occur when driving in and around NYC every day.
B002TIGUTG|3|I haven't bought this item but I did notice that it is sold as the wrong gender. That is a hen.
B002QMV70M|5|When the options are compared to the other 'cheap' jacks, such as twin chambers and lifting capacity, you really need think about two things; 1) Do I trust the jack to perform? 2) How long will it last?   I've had several brands of aluminum jacks from the $99 Harbor Freight to the $159 Craftsman, all have failed to live up to my expectations. The OTC Aluminum Racing Jack is the real deal and has endured real racing abuse. The fact that it comes with two jack stands for less than the price of the jack by itself is just a bonus. You don't need to spend $600 on an all aluminum jack, but you definitely should plan to spend $200.
B000AMSC2Q|5|This fuel filter assembly was for a 1995 Saturn SL2. I purchased it because it cost a lot less than the one from the dealer. It fit right in and there were no issues.
B0014H19YY|5|i bought this face plate for my wife's car. The quality is fantastic. a durable metal that is representative of the vehicle. I absolutely love it. It did take my wife several days before she even noticed the new accessory, nevertheless, I love it and she did too!
B008Y7XWBK|5|Arrived promptly and met all my expectations
B008RUFWBW|5|These keys feel like decent quality and get the job done. I like mine a lot for my CBR600RR. It looks good and does what I need it to do.
B001GG09GW|5|super cheap, shipping was extremely fast, and the sticker looks professional! its doing pretty good up against the rain as well. this decal sticker is awesome!
B008G3KJ1S|5|It work. it was what I needed. thank you autoanddart. I will do more businesswith u .thank u again .
B001KQ43BU|5|My mechanic told me to order this on Amazon to save some $$$, he installed it and it works great.
B00AZ4RMWA|5|Used VENTSHADES for many years. These are just as good for about 1/3 the price. Always get 2 sets for mishaps,  etc. I didn't know they were so good. Trying for my 2nd set. PLEASE MAKE MORE!?!;-]
B002WB61DA|4|so far seem to be fine- installed 500 miles ago no problems. be careful of the wagner site though they had the wrong part number/disc diameter for my 2007s Mini cooper. The site said the S model takes a 180cm and the factory disc is actually a 194cm diameter, the non-S does take a 180cm.
B006VOTFS2|5|Easy install, cool sound
B001AZH6H4|5|Well constructed, does what it's suppose to, great price!  That's about it, not much more to say!  Have a good day.
B007P3NMJG|2|This is not real carbon fiber. The image and price makes you think so, but the actual product is just some piece of plastic with a sprayed on carbon fiber look. Feels and look cheap, but at least it covers the holes in the pod, I guess..
B009DJU874|5|cheap replacement part but just as reliable as a brand name, these parts just don't have the stickers on them saying &#34;blah blah blah company&#34;
B00E83E6NW|5|Was just like description said
B004SFKJIQ|5|I went with the reviews and what the Camco people said. I put it in the dressing room of a horse trailer. I was just a little tired of the blue portable hot things you see everywhere. This is wonderful. If you cannot handle 5 gallons, use less and empty it more often. It does not develop an odor and comes with several packs of stuff to put in to prevent that.
B009D3DYHG|5|The T Handle has a solid build. Use it exclusively on my motorcycle and replaced my ratchet in my tool box. You can feel if a bolt is about to strip. It is a bit big to carry everyday in my toolkit but its 10.5&#34; what else would I expect.
B00CBQFE8Y|5|worked at one i installed it, good manufacture, good material thanks for the buyer, i used it for 2009 Jeep commander
B00CHEWNV6|1|Took a while to receive. Only to open the box and find the rear floor mat. Then realized this floor mats was for the wrong car, the Veloster not for my Elantra.<br /><br />I emailed them, and received timely and apologetic responses from Holly.<br /><br />Only to ultimately get a refund. Very disappointed.<br /><br />The mat for the Veloster strikes me as being thin and flimsy. Yep, it'd hold water, but any type of food would grind into the fibrous mat.<br />It's cheap quality.
B004HCM9H4|5|Love it!!  No waxxy residue left!!  Its the last step in detailing--clay bar..polish and then wax....and its by far the easiest step--thank god!  Our CRV and Tucson just shine and love how the water beads up!!
B009S31VVW|5|Part was just what I needed.
B000E81VN8|5|Great item. Everytime I use it, which is everyday, I am so glad I ordered it.  It holds sooo much.
B00MGHVS5Q|3|It works and keep mosquito coil burns more safely than the holder which comes with the coils.  But with this design, the unit is starting to feel sticky after using a few coils.
B0002MA4WA|4|Used two sets to line my ramp for the lawn tractor, trailer, etc on my outbuilding.  Wanted the wider exposure to make sure I didn't need to thread the needle getting up the ramp.
B000CMKEK2|1|Bought these mats to fit a 2002 Pontiac. The package states they are custom fit, trim to spec pair of mats. However, there is no way these mats will trim down to size to fit in the car without destroying the mat. Will not purchase from Husky again.
B00BTGSGFK|3|they rip to fast
B0002MBKUK|5|Just what the ad said it was, works great, fit great, looks great..totally pleased with the entire transaction!!
B00AE2VGK2|2|The picture shown is not what I received. Although they are of good quality, I was really looking forward to the small design on the left of the handle. So just be cautious when ordering. You will not be getting what you see on this picture.
B0076PK9NU|1|Look good but did not have everything to connect to the factory harness. Had to return them.
B000HPQ1GU|5|These Moog Springs were purchased to try to fix a problem in a Toyota Camry whereby the Camry would bottom out on any speed bump when there were occupants in the rear seat (including children). These variable rate springs did the trick. The car can handle more weight and no longer has any problem.
B001CF53PY|5|This cover works really well.  I can travel without my top and doors on days with thunderstorms in the afternoon and sunshine the rest of the day.  Keeps out water, pollen and sun.  Seems to be almost waterproof in several exposures.  It is a heavy material, so you will need a bit of space to carry with you.  You might want to buy a stuff sack as well.  It fits better if you put it on the windshield side first and then move to the back.  The first few times it will be tight, but stretches slightly the more you use it.
B000E7FN5Q|4|fits perfectly on my 2006 Acura TL cold air intake clean and oiled up
B0009IQZPW|5|Excelent Product.
B002ZS4QCS|4|Smaller than I thought but they worked as advertised. They bend easily so the 10lb limit seems correct. I'm using them to hang a back pack on because it tends to roll around and flip over. I got tired of my sack getting all beat-up and dirty and no one likes that.<br />I can't really say much about them other than they're thin and could be prone to over extension. That's up to you to take care of.<br />I'm using one for now and I'll save the other in case the first one breaks.<br /><br />UPDATED: I've been using this to support a back pack that's about 15lbs and so far it's working fine. The rubber ends are still in place and the 'prone to' bending I mentioned earlier is really not an issue.<br />Upgrading to 4 stars but I needed the extended use to confirm. I recommend this.
B00NWT4EHG|1|Bought this item to fix the short in my old one. Not only did I not fix my original problem but It made my other side short out as well making both sides of my lights not work.
B00BQK59BI|5|I was debating whether to purchase these or leave ny silver painted mirrors alone on my 2013 Nissan Rogue (SV).  I decided to buy and trail fit.  Wow, I couldn't get the stick-0n double bacl-tape strips off fast enough.  Their abs plastic with a outstanding brilliant  chrome over-lay.  Those mirrors are on to stay and Hug the  outside of the mirrors like a factory molded installed glove.  You have the outline of the black because they only cover the painted portion of the mirror.  When installing line-up outside border of the paint as close as you can with the mirror cover and just lay down very gently, readjust if you see paint out-line.  If you push down hard before its aligned, you will have to live with it.  That double-back tape is unforgiving once it is pressed home, believe me.  I have worked with it on a full dash kit ( honey burl), and rear bumper guard on my Rogue.  My trick, \\"Trial fit, Trial fit, Trial fit,\\" and you will have it look like a pro installed it and pocket the change for another acc!<br />,
B009SBJ68O|5|works great perfect fit fast shipping great customer service
B000KPU8F2|4|Be aware that running production changes are made, so your unit might be somewhat different than mine.  I just received the unit, charged it for 24 hours, and used it once.  So this is by no means a long-term test!<br /><br />P=Pro<br />C=Con<br />N= Neutral<br /><br />P=Quick, courteous e-mail response from Clore Automotive Technical Support to my e-mail as to what the &#34;Grip Guards&#34; (TM) were that needed to be reinstalled.  They are mentioned in my owner manual.<br />C=Needing to send an e-mail question to Clore.  Their response--&#34;The manual has not been updated.  Grip guards are not used on current production units.  Thank you.&#34;<br /><br />P=The screw on and off chuck connector for the air compressor, rather than a quick on and quick off connector.  Yes, the chuck connector can be a bit more difficult to attach and remove, resulting in more loss of air from the tire.  But I have never had the chuck type fly off in the midst of inflation.  I have had the quick connector type do so.  I suggest you over inflate your tires to allow for the extra loss of air, and then bleed them down to the desired pressure using a separate gauge.<br /><br />P=I like the 68&#34; length of the jumper cables.  You have a reasonable chance of being able to place the unit on the ground and reach the car's battery with them.<br /><br />P=The air compressor got the pressure in my space saver spare tire from about 50 psi to a little over 60 psi in just a few minutes.<br /><br />N=The accuracy of the air compressor gauge is within a couple of pounds of a separate gauge that I think is fairly accurate.  As Clore recommends, check the final pressure with a properly calibrated tire gauge.<br /><br />C=I do not like that there is neither an on/off switch nor caps to put over the jump start cable clamps.  I used duct tape to cover the exposed portion of the positive clamp.<br /><br />C=I do not know why there is a 12 foot coiled cord for the air compressor.  I could understand thisif power were derived from the car's power port or the car's battery.  It seems to me that six feet would be ample, and that the cord should not be coiled.  There should be hooks on the rear of the unit so that the cord could be stored more conveniently.<br /><br />C=Specifications on the air compressor's capacity are not stated, at least not where I could find them.  The Clore website, in answer to a question, said the unit should be okay for trailer tires requiring 65 psi, even though the gauge maximum is 60 psi.  I do not know why the specifications are such a secret.
B002BTSSJ8|2|these glasses looks good  &#34;Yes&#34;. my glasses can fit inside it tidily but it worked , this is not the issue. I tried it for a 10 mins ride , arrived with a big fat headache because of the distortion in the lenses , I guess it got a bit of power in the lenses.<br />Tried to replace the lenses with a medical ones but couldn't as they might be fixed with glue or something that prevent it from being easily removed to be changed.<br />Don't waste your money. my advise is  try the attachable bubble shield and keep your glasses as it is.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Worked ok
B0059JHASW|5|improved mpg by 4 just by changing filter! And it has more pick up and go. Everyone should have one.
B002GZD8JM|2|the box was just to big to mount anywhere.
B000JZFT6G|5|The second I installed this on my 2004 Ford ranger 3.0L Edge I noticed a difference in how the engine runs. Startup and driving is great. More power and I have a Flowmaster super 44 and it made it significantly louder even at idle. Gas mileage has increased and am very satisfied. Money well spent.
B000BU7BG0|1|Looks like a toy...  and provides an airflow less than a toy.  I was completely dissappointed with this product. Instant heat my behind.  You plug it in, and there is an airflow,but the thing never really heats up. Don't waste your money like I did...  Hopefully there is a return policy, but I doubt it.  I wish I could have rated lower than 1 star.  Garbage!!
B006SYNF9K|4|I have a 2012 Hyundai Elantra and it seems to be too long across and about 6&#34; too short from top to bottom. Bummer. It still fits enough to where I can make it work but definitely not going to be an easy thing to do. The quality of the product itself is pretty strong and durable though :)
B000CC0HZ4|3|Doesn't hang up in my Nissan PU... had to jury rig a method bit made it work
B007FVVBE6|5|Excellent quality. Ordered addition product from this vendor. Great service. Will purchase again.
B00556H5X4|4|I have been using this fluid for two year, and it meet OEM standards
B00JVVX1P0|5|Got this for my 10yr old granddaughter, she loves it, way bigger than we thought so that made it that much more awesome.
B00GQOGQMA|4|switch works great. except for the fact that they say it is a 9 - 30 v dc switch. but they forget to mention that the relay in the switch is only a 14 vdc
B000OQTGEG|3|We bought two of these widgets (one for each car) and they are really convenient - as long as the battery lasts.  After a few years, the battery fails and you start getting false readings. I took one of them apart to see if the battery could be replaced and found that they are not service friendly - meaning that if you really wanted to replace the battery you could, but you would have to remove a dozen screws from a printed circuit bourd just to get to the battery and I didn't think it was worth the effort. I just replaced them with two old fashioned analog gauges that will probably work forever.
B01078GH6A|4|Great product! Only downside is the bag does not stay put and easily bored or of container when I put the windows down. Easily resolved by placing binder clips on it to hold the bag in place.
B00JQWNJCO|5|Why spend $300 on a B cool this is awesome for the price! Fox body Mustang
B000C39C6I|4|Ok Product I am plaesed with the operational results.The product was used on a V8 engine to control the operational temperatures via cooling fans on the radiator ,worked very well, recomended product.
B000EA5WLS|5|Read instructions!!! This product works very well when used with some finesse. Don't be afraid to reduce the pressure on the windsheild a little while increasing injector pressure. The injector does need to be unscrewed to release air, add some more resin and inject again. I am amazed that the \\"bullseye\\" crack is completely invisible now. A perfect repair.
B001R8XOTI|5|Looks great bought 5 , 3 I gave away 2 of which were strangers that stop me at red lights!
B000JZI2GK|5|Dealer wanted twice the price, what a savings!
B00HD9TI7M|5|fit perfect.  easy to install, great price and fast shipping.
B002XLHUQG|5|Getting seasick from walking around in your trailer?  These really work.  Put them in and walk around as if you are planted on the ground.  Worth getting a set!
B00AGYFJYM|5|this is my second sticker because i traded my last vehicle in and i just had to have this one on the new vehicle too. couldn't resist.
B00BI28ANI|4|Works pretty well on urethane bumpers.
B005C1Y9D6|5|Excellent replacement for incandescent bulbs.  Clean white light much easier on the eyes.  Very easy to install and great value, very reasonable cost.  I purchased a second set for another vehicle.
B00029X3QC|1|The lights did not come with a usable mounting system. I could not use them on my vehicle. I am totally disappointed in this product.
B000BYEMFO|5|This piece works perfectly in my 2000 Honda Civic. It's the exact same size as the original, with some slight design changes. After replacing this piece, my engine is no longer throwing codes and I have gained significant boosts in responsiveness and power.
B000BQSIWK|4|Simple to use; easy instructions; works as promised.
B00029J77G|5|Do what they are supposed to - feed fuel at the proper rate to your engine.
B00E1SOSUK|5|Very good service. Attention to the expected height. biligue staff very willing to help. I recommend this place as a reliable. Sure you will  find parts at a good price.
B00076QA4C|5|I bought this because everything in my trunk was sliding around every time i turned a corner, it works great. My trunk has anchors loops in it already, so i just attached it with some S hooks instead of the hardware that it comes with. I really like that it has a flat bottom, as opposed to the hammock style ones, and the dividers keep everything neat. Very good buy, I would definitely recommend it.
B00AMQH27G|3|Did what I needed however the color is NOT warm white as advertised. Much closer to cool white. Maybe even a little bit more blue.
B001L2E8MC|5|I was complete satisfied with the 422 Series Toyota Corolla 15&#34; Hubcaps Wheel Covers New Set.  They were complete a stated on the web site.
B00FW4P5C2|5|I'm really glad i ordered this carburetor with GASKETS. The Honda GCV160 engine has a lot of them when you remove the carburetor/air filter assembly. There is a good chance that some of them will get torn or damaged in the process. Who wants to then go looking for more gaskets in the middle of replacing the carburetor? Also i suggest that you very carefully remove the whole assembly by leaving the long bolts pushed thru the assembly as you pull it away from the engine. I got confused as to which gaskets came from which interface and how the black plastic block was oriented to the engine block. This probably sounds silly, but when you take it apart you'll see what i am describing. After installing, the engine flooded and finally started, then was hard to restart. I took it all apart again, removed the bowl and checked the float/needle.The float may have been stuck open. Reinstalled it all very carefully, hoping to get the gaskets in the correct spots. Started right up and runs normally now.
B004Q83TGO|1|I contacted the manufacturer and they say it works fine, but while connected to a good 12 volt battery (with 9.6 volts) and full sun, the battery has no power gain in 8 hours.
B000FPY06A|4|It does not come with screws to mount to the door. I had to purchase 2 screws separate from the local hardware store. Great construction though.
B002RSIK4G|5|I purchased this product to renew the seam on the rubber roof of my RV.  I used the recommended cleaner and roller to make sure that it sealed properly.  No leaks in over a year with constant exposure to the elements.
B0009OR94M|4|Dosent seem like a full set! No smaller sizes but I ordered the straight ones too and they do!
B001Q8DM9G|5|I used these to apply and buff Leather Afterlife conditioner to an Eames lounger and these made it very easy, they're nice and thick and you can fold them and really get in the cracks.
B000BW8NGU|5|These spark plug wires are just the best. Supple and easy to install. Excellent contact points for the distributor and plugs I suggest using these with a new cap and rotor.
B004X9BT1I|5|Fantastic!!!!! I am soooo happy with this item. At first I was a very skeptical about this item because the price was to good to be true and you know what they say about that! My vehicle wasn't worth what the repairman wanted to fix it so I thought i'd go online just to see what I could see and I found this item for almost ten times!!!!!! that is right..... ten times... cheaper than the repair shop wanted for it! I very cautiously purchased this item fully expecting the worst i.e. it's a real cheap item that will not measure up or it wouldn't last a week. to tell the truth it is the most valuable part on my van right now!! LOL I even had the mechanic put it in that quoted the original fix it price of $740. ended up costing less than $300!!!!!! Thank you Amazing Amazon!!!!! Now I can save up a little longer for that new vehicle I WANT.
B0055QOM6M|4|I haven't used it much because I am usually riding sweep on group rides or on twisties but when I have used it it works fine holding the speed.
B000B90LZE|5|covered the hole well
B004NW9BJC|5|My son loved these while his wife was not too happy - but I love to make my son happy............
B00NNYLBS0|5|Nice plugs, they work great on my 2010 Bmw 535i, Thank You.
B002ZTNV5K|4|excellent material self explanatory good material I will recommend this product to anybody
B008XOCUC6|4|it wasnt a nice as i was hoping for but it is nice enought came with huge non for cooper screws dont use them get correct screws
B003UW1IQU|5|I purchased this polisher based on the other reviews  as well as the known quality of Porter Cable products. I've used it to polish five cars so far and could not be happier with the quality and ease of use. The variable speed makes this polisher extremely versatile. The kit is well worth the minimal additional cost.
B008D96KOA|5|I bought this as a gift for a friend. She loved it and has it put on her jeep .
B00BTJJKOS|5|Bright, and white light.  Used in RV for overhead lighting.
B00EZZVI7U|3|NOT a direct match for &#34;square shaped&#34; ceiling lights in my motor coach<br />Also .. light is &#34;whiter/brighter&#34; than the florescence tubes.  More &#34;blue-ish&#34;?
B00N3RM186|3|Received unit on delivery date and upon opening the box, there was no AC cord for charging the unit (box only contained a car charger).  The information on the website does not state was is included inside the box.  Now I must make a separate order.
B013W43PHA|5|thanks works good for safety
B001RMTY8E|5|Amazing roll off is the best product for removing black streaks from our trailer without damaging the finish.  Just spray it on and the streaks disappear; truly incredible.  It also keeps my white convertible top looking brand new. We love this product and always buy it in the economical gallon.  It has a million uses.  Works great on outdoor furniture, too.
B000E9TS6O|5|I bought this after reading multiple glowing reviews on a detailing message board. I have not been disappointed in the ease of use and final outcome when using ONR.     I like it so much, I bought some of their other car wash/detailing products and have been blown away with them as well.  Their spray on wax is phenomenal and goes on with no streaking or fuss. The tire gel applies easily and covers well with a brilliant shine.  The leather protectant provides a nice, but not overly glossy finish.  Best of all, it is not greasy like other interior cleaning products.    With ONR and the products I mentioned, I can completely wash and wax my Corvette Z06 in under 45 minutes with less than 2 gallons of water.  I constantly get comments on how clean the car looks (daily driven, no less).     I've noticed that since using the OPT suite of products that I can go much longer between washes as well.  They claim their formulas repel dirt and I've seen it. I usually wash my car every weekend with a spray on wax coating once every 3 or 4 weeks, but I can go 2 weeks without a washing and still look very good.    I recommend ONR and OPT (Optimum Polymer Technologies) products to everyone who inquires how I keep my car so clean. You will not be disappointed.
B008CE0W5Y|5|replaced a set of incandescent lights on my trailer and these babies are brighter and exact replacements.  this is my second set that I have installed and a third one will be put on next week.  I recommend to all.<br /><br />Pro: Ease of installation, Brighter than old lights, exact replacements<br /><br />Con: Cheap wire connectors
B00CB3H494|5|My wife loved it.
B004SND8EA|5|Strapped on 10 ft paddle board without problems. No problem attaching Rack Base to runners on car. Saved about $50 buying on internet
B0022ZAFOC|5|Great  seller  would definitely recommend.
B000JZ77RA|5|I have a 2001 GMC Yukon and recently replaced the rear brake lights/turn signal lights with new LED light fixtures and replaced the front running lights/turn signal lights with new LED light fixtures.  Since the new LED lights use less current, the original electro-mechanical flasher started to flash very rapidly falsely indicating that a light bulb was burned out.  To fix this issue, you can install this Tridon EP29 Electronic Flasher which will provide normal speed flashing with your new LED light fixtures.      The original flasher is on the back side of the fuse panel which is not easy to reach.  To get to it you will need to remove the lower kick panel below the steering column by removing the two bottom screws.  You can pull out the panel on the left side just far enough to reach the flasher.  To confirm that it's the flasher just turn on your ignition and turn on the turn signal.  You should be able to hear and feel the clicking sound and vibration on the flasher. Please note that there is a retaining clip on the side facing you that must be released prior to removing the flasher.  Don't worry there is not a retaining clip on the other side... just the one facing you.      Remove the original 4-pronged flasher and install the new EP29 flasher. Replace the lower kick panel and you're done.  I had searched the entire internet for these instructions and could not find them so I was compelled to share my experience.  By the way, I posted an updated picture of the product which has reference to LED on the unit.  I noticed that the photo on the product did not have it listed.  Happy flashing !!
B007T6QS1S|4|Replaced the batteries in my APC Back-UPS. Returned the unit to operational status. 2nd purchase from Batterysharks and would purchase from them again.
B00407V3RI|5|It took an extra can or two to complete the project, but this paint did the trick and the price is white, (right).. Make sure you get clear coat and sand paper.. and spray evenly..<br /><br />Overall its the brightest part of her car now..
B0002Z9NLU|5|Made it sound a little beefy i like it.
B007OXCIB0|5|Great wrap! Has a texture to it and looks spot on like black diagonal carbon fiber. Wrapped interior trim parts on my car and used a hair dryer to form fit everything. Very nice product
B000CITK8S|5|Works great...
B0091UB5TA|3|Mediocre
B001O7PNXC|5|I chose the Meguiar's 105 & 205 combination based on reviews from online forums.  I bought them from Amazon for less than 1/2 what the local stores charge.<br /><br />I am a total color sanding novice.  I painted a gas tank for an old ATV and ended up with some orange peel in it.<br /><br />After knocking down the orange peel with 1500 paper (wet), I used the 105 Ultra Cut to clean up the tank.  I used a foam pad in my cordless drill at low speed.<br /><br />The tank came out great - even using just the ultra cut.  You could probably skip the 205 Polishing compound and still be happy.<br /><br />But, I followed up the 105 with the 205 Ultra Finishing Polish and was amazed at the results.  I spent less than 30 minutes polishing the tank and could not be happier.
B00ICF0RVW|4|Everthing as advertised
B00CFBT7OM|5|Appears to be good quality. Time will tell how it performs.
B00NY4LQHU|5|These are well made, durable and very bright. I have purchased three total Opt7 light bars for my truck and 4Wheeler. I have a 20&#34; installed on the front of my truck and two 3&#34; pods on the rear,  I have not had any issues with them. I Recommend buying the Opt7 wiring harness for a simple install. Can't beat the quality for the price!
B000XJRYQ6|3|It's ok.
B00D44TL22|2|The Floater is not working, I can not control the gas level.
B004L5WLZ2|5|Holy shine!<br />You known when you get that girl that's great in bed, and you really want to tell your friends, but you don't, because you want to keep her all to yourself?<br /><br />Well, yeah that's what this stuff is like<br />I'm not telling ANY of my friends, I'll just stand by my car with that grin, you know the grin<br /><br />wow, this stuff is awesome very easy on, and real easy off
B001V97K02|5|This toolbox worked out good I ordered it in about two weeks later was on my porch and I welded it on my truck and everything has been working fine since then
B001C6NL52|5|Met expectations
B009F7UE0A|5|Strong, goood looking...lots of compliments, Plenty of room, Weighs next to nothing, Exactly what I wanted.  I had purchased the Mach 5 Ogio and so glad I returned it for this although it does not have compartments.
B006UTDXLS|5|I gave it all five stars.  Realistically, however, it is to soon to know.  I put the instructed one ounce into each of my five gallon gas cans for storage.  I'll know in a year if the gas still runs the generator or vehicles.
B00JSMRN9M|3|Bought six ignition coils and one failed after one week<br />vendor shipped fast
B003D50KHC|5|It fit like a glove. I had to work in some with some faucet grease but it works great.  no more leaking toilet!
B00BLPVYJO|5|Great tool for outside winter running
B005FOMPMC|5|Perfect fight, doesn't ride up or down too much. I can wear them under my jeans and to work after my ride without having to change. awesome
B000O3K2OW|5|Great part, great price. Fit perfectly and much much cheaper price than the local parts stores wanted. You can't go wrong with it.
B002GP87NO|5|Put it on the trunk of my black car and it looks great! Been through car washes and weather and it is still there.
B001D02SUG|3|not a huge improvement over my stock harley brakes,, they are very noisy also fyi,, sounds like a taxi cab at times..... packaging from shipper was horrible,, in an envelope... the pads where chipped on the edges because of this...
B003TXW4S6|5|I ordered the Redskins headrest covers and they were delivered in a timely fashion and were exactly what they were purported to be.  I am very satisfied with this transaction.  Now, can somebody out there coach DEFENSE?
B00C7PX19I|4|Great product and timely delivery
B00GXONMWU|5|Smells so good!!
B00GLLW3AM|5|Love Them bright
B00CYP2GWO|5|Great product, would recommend.
B000TROIGQ|5|I bought this to take pressure off of my rapidly declining knee joint in my work as a carpenter and it has helped. Be careful using it on soft wood floors it will leave marks.
B00EKLRK7G|5|Simple thing, standard stock stuff. BMW part numbers imprinted.<br />Looks and feels right.<br />Little thing, but I am glad this seller carries it.
B00L3E0LQU|5|Fits 2015 Camry LE. I believe they actually call it a &#34;convenience net&#34;, as it is not designed to fit in your trunk which would require it to take up much more space and act as sort of a divider in the actual trunk itself. That was how the cargo net in my wife's previous car performed causing us to disengage it form it hooks on one side or the other to utilize the trunk for larger items. Instead this net stretches across the trunk opening and acts as catch all and flexible barrier. Wife loves it. Not really sure why it doesn't come with car standard as the cleats it is fastened to are already in place inside trunk. Bargain at twenty three dollars. Would recommend.
B009DJV4PO|4|Fit pretty good, some holes didn't line up. I had to drill new ones, seems thinner and more flexible than original.
B00EI9WEDK|5|Fits the vehicle perfectly. No problems with the packaging or installation. Takes a while to ship but no issues with the product.
B001TA3TC6|4|Whistles LOUDLY, specialy over 40 mph.
B005TMHM8C|5|OK fit not perfect but still OK
B009KW82CC|5|Coolest Key chain ever! It was the perfect shade as described,spins on the keychain when blown, Delivered sooner than usual, boyfriend loved it! JDM<3
B001ZTDR50|4|Good price and quick shipping, had to charge the battery when I got it, but it came up ok with no problems.
B002BB633O|5|nice
B006VFEJJQ|1|then we had starting problems again. took the prius in to Bill Penney Toyota dealer, they said the battery was bad. I'll update when/if i find out otherwise.
B000JRCVCE|2|Contains advice that is simply misleading and may cause additional time/repair costs - found what I needed on youtube + google instead
B00BR1TKOS|2|didn't know how heavy it was. and it only last 15 minutes fully charged. to much bother to send the 2 back or I would of.
B00KTHXYO8|5|Works perfectly.
B00D9GUDVI|5|Works great so far after 2weeks
B005XRQQ3K|5|Super fast shipping,great lights,price...thankyou Amazon
B007JUFB7Q|3|Overall product was ok. Didn't receive screw with packaging. Not  a huge deal but IMO should be included.
B00OJB96C4|1|buy the end of my 2nd ride the finger stitching had already came undone allowing one finger to come out now I'll have to pay someone to repair on a positive they were warm and dry for the most part
B000OQIGA6|5|Works awesome
B005208WM6|5|Listen if you need coil springs for you truck these are the affordable way to go who cares that the paint sucks it's not about the looks...GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE
B000KQ2SIG|5|This is my second WeatherTech mats so I had a good idea of the fit and quality.  Living in PA and given the winter we are having these have been a life/carpet saver.  Perfect.
B00U3D8V64|5|It's a sticker, so there's not much to write but I will say, it sticks very well. I haven't noticed any peeling.
B001C5QGZA|5|Awsome
B0085FOVR0|1|I received an exhaust for a 94 Honda wouldn't fit even tho I orders a 93
B0012INT98|5|This product worked as advertised!! I drove from Chicago to Montreal Quebec and 9 of the 12 hour trip was in driving rain on the way up. When we arrived I was surprised that not a drop of water was inside the carrier. All of our belongings were completely dry. On the way home it rained so hard that we had to slow down to 20 mph for almost an hour and everything inside was still dry. Over 1500 miles and the product worked great.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be to also purchase the Rola 59200 Flat Strap Cargo Net and the Rightline Gear 100650 Non-Skid Roof Pad. When using the Rola flat strap cargo net you do not have to use the straps that come with the Rightline carrier. Due to all the rain the straps provided with the Rightline carrier became loose and stretchy which could have had a bad outcome.
B000COAVHQ|4|Designed for the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, despite what Amazon says. Arrived unboxed with the mounting hardware duct-taped to it. Made sure all the hardware was there and mounted it that evening. Use two jack stands and a single person can install this in less than an hour. Purchased from Amazon because of the price and free shipping.
B000EQN3QI|5|The OEM pads were great on this car, so we wanted to go with OEM replacements. Hard to find, but found them here, and they're exactly what we wanted.
B000CGTNCI|5|Works perfectly in a 1995 Dodge Dakota it's great to have my power steering back
B000IXSF7O|5|It matches the spare tire cover I purchased from Amazon.  It fits perfect and has real nice grips at the point the three pints where Tweety is depicted.
B003YC8E90|5|Great quality and upgrade for Toyota Yaris Sedan Base. They look great and the price is fair. If you want to upgrade the look of your car, these will do it.
B000XQ9MGE|1|Did not start car, (after MANY tries!) despite being the unit rec. by the mfgr. (four cyl.. Saturn wagon)  Conflicting info about charge status in manual.  (about charge lights; what constitutes a &#34;charged&#34; unit,and what doesn't...?) Amazon would not take unit back, as unit is &#34;non-returnable&#34;.  So, it is up to me to take it apart, and dispose of the battery  Needless to say, I won't be buying another unit from this mfgr.  I should have known better; you buy cheap, you get cheap... (although $64 ain't exactly change in my book!)
B000C59WHA|5|This was very easy to install in my truck. 15 minutes tops, great product so far.  Very good buy for the money
B000UUMM6K|5|Good quality product at reasonable price.  I didn't have vent cover on my Coachmen travel trailer and now I can leave the vent open at all times without worry about wind damage or weather.
B00496RE82|1|It wouldn't run.. jammed up and I couldn't free it. Just hummed when powered up.  Sent it back.. will order a new soon.
B004I0ZBMA|4|Works like a champ on my 2006 Forester Subaru.  A little hard to get in, but note - you can remove the old one and get the new one in all from the underside of the car without taking the bumper off!  Just lots of hand and wrist contortions to get all the connection and screws.
B00IPJ9EHI|5|Looks perfect for the front seats, will. Update if problems arise
B00BT99Q88|5|Exactly what I needed at a great price!
B000CSKIES|5|These are by far the best vent visors out there for these trucks.  I purchased another set that instead of using adhesive they snapped in between the window glass and the weather stripping.  The window motor struggled to raise the window completely and wore off my aftermarket window tint.  Threw them in the garbage after 3 days.  These vents stick perfectly to the outside of the window, look great, and don't stress any weatherstripping or the window motors.  Highly recommended.
B007O5BBUC|5|It was kind of hard at first but once I gained access to the cover for the lights, they slipped right in no problem. I am very impressed with the look of them. Almost brought tears to my eyes compared to the other factory dull rings.
B004RCUX8G|5|This item arrive ahead of schedule, was exactly as described and I have installed it quite easy and it doing the job it was designed to do..Thanks
B001P29O5Y|2|I have only used it four times, and two of the rubber part that the bike sits on ripped so the straps cannot hold the bike in place. Apparently there is a recall on it. There is not even a website for TransLite products to get replacement pieces for it.<br /><br />I have a 2013 Nissan Frontier truck, and it does not sit properly in the hitch, it shirts left to right.<br /><br />I do not recommend this bike rack!
B00032KC30|2|Could not get these to work properly on my license tag bracket....
B0036D61F6|5|I like this helmet but have yet to wear it.
B002MQ4WUY|1|Product was not as advertised. It was suppose to be a 2x. The product was also only DOT rated which the ad did not give all the rating one needed
B003VASKC6|5|The product is great !  I really like the return to center feature after you have turned the corner.  I wish in the ordering process they would make it more clear that it DOES NOT come with any mounting brackets , they must be ordered seperately.
B0031GLIGA|3|I was disappointed to receive this part, which was supposed to fit my 2003 Acura MDX but turned out not to fit.
B000P9IGG6|2|This works as you would suspect but my issue is more with the actual fragrance which is less citrus and more like very sweet orange candy.
B0041U2SUK|5|Excellent product ! It is easy to install and it will only take about 2 min to take out the old light, and 2 min to put the new light on. Very attractive look.  Highly recommended.
B007AOQW24|5|perfect fit for honda 2013, makes it easy to keep the car clean in the winter or rainy weather. plus there is a lifetime warranty which is amazing.
B001QIUGVI|5|for the money it's hard to beat.  Has been working on ABS and SRS codes as well as all other OBDII codes
B000EDQQHO|4|Worked as expected .
B00DOLOGC0|4|bought this for my son's headers, worried about burning new plug wires after header installation, but the plug wires kept away from the headers, so I found other areas to use this.  Don't know how well it actually works on the headers, but on other parts of the exhaust, it worked great, so I imagine it would work well on the headers themselves...
B00062Z40I|1|Not recomended , Does not work<br />  On stains!!.
B0050HZCEM|5|Thanks for the key. It worked.
B000CZ3H26|1|If you tighten the wingnut enough to make a good seal, the plastic will eventually break, and you will come back to find a puddle of oil under your now incapacitated vehicle.  As you clean several quarts of oil off of the pavement, you will find yourself wishing you had fixed the oil pan properly the first time.
B005BH1HT0|5|perfect!
B0027TX88I|2|Yes these quick struts  DO  make strut changing  so  so much easier!!!<br />Super!!<br />HOWEVER--------<br />The drivers side  Monroe Quick Strut on my Chyrysler 300m front  was defective ,,turned while steering adding a good solid Popping Sound !!<br />Was  replaced free of charge~~!!<br /><br />OK , struts  are on----- the ride is like a concrete truck  from HELL!!  Stiff,, Stiff,, Stiff,,  knock your teeth out on not so good streets !!!!! Terrible!!<br />Good only for smooth asphault ~~!!<br />Worse ,, I did all 4 wheels with Monroe quick struts!! The front is bad enough, the rears ride  thoroughly solid city!!  Car rides smooth on smooth asphalt,,<br />when tar stripes are hit, small pot holes, rocks, bridge upheaveal, the front ride is firm  city the rear is just simply  too terrible!!<br />Way too stiff ,,solid!!<br /><br />Reccomdation;  A Worst Buy!!<br /><br />A Mechanic was helping me (recommended as the rear struts replacement  is hell on earth  as Chrysler designed the rear removal as follows.) Remove rear seat bottom,, 2, 15 millimeter sockets  remove rear seat back@ bottom!!.Remove rear radio speakers and wires. Yes!! remove seat  belts .., Strut tops can now be seen.  Rear strut removal is same as front struts  -but  taking the spring loaded rear strut out--takes a 6 foot prybar  by 2 220 lb men in good  shape,, or a spring compressor on the old strut!! Installation  is the same  -in short - TERRIBLE!!<br />I had to pay my mechanic for installing the front  strut twice,  the rears  took 2 hours to remove ,,2 miserable hours to replace and it was miserable  as the rear Monroe Quick  Strut,  is  long  long long ,,has to be compressed anyway to get it back out & in!! Chrysler  I will never -ever buy one of your products  -ever again -never!! Every thing on a Chrysler product is designed to give a homeowner , total hell on earth to replace ,from thermostats to batteries.. to sensors,  -now struts!!<br />Cannot even tighten an alternator belt!!<br />Monroe  the these quack struts  need to  be replaced along with the engineer quack that designed this disaster !Way too stiff  hard to install ( installation is not Monroe's fault  as Chrysler  designed this so even Quick Struts are terrible to install!
B00TORH3S2|5|Seems like a great towel. Nice and plush. Definitely a cut above the cheap branded towels you can find at your local discount stores. No indication of where it was made.
B001GF3SAM|5|Bought this to protect the dash from the sun - as these cars are notorious for dash pads cracking. Fits well and does the trick. I always flip the visors in front to secure it even better. Buy without hesitation for 93-2002 firebirds/trans am/camaro
B005IGSXDC|1|It looks as if everything in this picture is what you are buying but in reality you are only getting the main brackets in the middle. This is somewhat deceptive.
B001P2JC9W|1|junk
B000BYGCYI|4|The pic is very misleading. They look nothing like it, but a little research confirmed they fit my 04 gmc truck. A little tricky to determine which set, since my year of truck has two possible coils that require two different wires. A good buy at a good price. Only four stars until pic is changed.
B00L74AQNY|2|The 5 point star screwdriver is microscopic.  The set has a lot of heads, but they don't stay in the handle well.  The case is pain to open and close.  The slots that hold the heads in the case don't hold them tightly, and they fall out easily.  When I received the set in its closed, sealed case, A few of the heads had already fallen out and were rattling around inside.  This will work in a pinch, but if you have another option, I'd suggest taking it.  The head sizes jump .5 for each ( 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5).  I found multiple times that I didn't have the needed size and almost stripped the screws trying to get them out.<br /><br />A side note:  Always be careful of 4 and 5 star ratings, especially when there are only a few ratings total.  It's not hard for the manufacturer to have a few people write bogus reviews to dupe you into buying their bogus product.
B007MHKG3K|5|Good size decal. very cute
B00HZGQYYI|5|Not only a fantastic break line but a fantastic company. I either misplaced or the hardware wasn't included in my shipment, I honestly can't recall. I called up Goodridge and they shipped me the hardware free of charge.<br /><br />That to me is a great company. Combined with a very well made brake cable with an outstanding warranty. I'm definitely recommending these guys to my friends.
B00K1KBFP8|5|Great service. The best wax you can buy. Very pleased.
B001FCAY8U|5|Excellent quality
B0093XZDS4|2|The stuff is ok but nowhere near as good as the videos claim surely not worth the nearly 30 dollars I paid for it, it's no better than Lucus or any other additive
B000C9B6CA|5|The rubber used to create this mount seems to be of a durometer lower than OEM mounts (it is quite soft and easy to leave permanent marks on it by pressing your fingernail into it), but I do find them to be very nice feeling once installed.  Noticed less motor movement while shifting. Not sure how long they will hold up to abuse, though. This mount is not pressed into the metal part: there is no ring that the rubber is contained within.  The rubber is basically bound/dried to the outer metal of the mount during the casting/drying process.
B000N8HV60|4|they look great but there are only two sticky strips, so I had to go out and buy more sticky strips. But it looks great and the shipping was on time
B001A1OXSS|5|Works great is identical to the one I needed to replace. It was quick and easy to instal.
B005VV8C76|5|Had a car wash incident. I installed this and switched the cover with my old one to color match. Installation was not to bad, switching the covers was the more difficult part. Looks great now and matches like it never happened.
B00CMN7W8Q|5|Fits and looks great.  Quick arrival time.
B001RKH7FS|5|This is a great product. We bought it to cool my wife's med's and it works as advertised. I would recommend it for long trips, just don't leave it on if your accessory outlet stays on when the car is turned off. For short stops don't worry, it stays cool for quite a while after the power is turned off. It also works well with the adapter if your hotel room doesn't have a refrigerator.
B000CIXOB2|3|as advertised. Fantastic price, Fits right, easily installed.  Just a little louder than I would like.
B00684LLV4|5|It harnessed them wires reeeeaallll good!!! I was real impressed by their harnessing ability. In terms of harnesses, you can't get better than this.
B001Q4VILY|4|So far I've used this with a 2 inch ball to pull up small tree stumps and large bushes.  It's attached to the receive hitch on my Gator and has not shown any indication of poor workmanship.<br />I like the fact that I can have a ball hitch as well has a pin hitch for the garden equipment.  That was the selling point for me.
B00BX96PHO|4|so far so good. 100 miles. will update if problems. For the money good chain kit
B00D96OA1C|5|I seen this same product in local stores and I am so glad I got it through amazon it was cheaper. I have received a lot of compliments from it. Love it. My SUV is red and I have personalize plates and these plate covers make it stands out more
B004K2FSXI|4|Used a few times on several cars. Gauge is easy to read and the threads and seals on the hoses a good.
B0006IX896|5|works great..
B00E1J0BGE|5|Fits perfectly in my 2015 CR-V. Happy to have mats that will contain snow and mud. You need to remove the mats that came with the vehicle for correct fit- Can't see them sliding around if you do. Rubber does not need to be thick; rubber is good- these replaced some small rectangular rubber mats that I bought for a new 1979 Pinto! (And they're still usable).There is a reason it is cut out around the accelerator- too much risk of curling up or getting stuck under it and causing an accident- some of the Toyota accelerator accidents were caused by floor mats. Can't see damage occurring there as your shoe is on the accelerator, not the carpet.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Perfect!!!
B00I36K1VQ|5|This is a very nice piece of electronics.  2000 watts works fine for the odd microwave blast and making coffee in my RV.  6000 watt surge I'm sure will come in handy.  This one piece (Inverter/Converter Charger/Switch made it very easy to wire into my main breaker panel.  I can run off my solar panels (which I do most of the time) and when I need or have power I just plug in and it will automatically switch my panel to shore power and charge the batteries. (I can turn off the charger because the solar panels keep my batteries fully charged most of the time).  Very helpful tech line and helped me sort out a few issues that were not the fault of the fault of the inverter (bad battery cables).
B005H5369U|5|The hid kit I ordered was a 6000k hid low beam/halogen high beam kit in 9003/h4 bulbs. Gotta start off by saying this is BY FAR the best hid kit I've ever ordered. Starts right up, no pulsing/flickering, even with a 3,000watt sound system. I've had this kit installed for about a month now, if not longer, and have not had a single problem. Definitely recommend this kit to anyone I know.
B000S2U6QI|5|This is a direct replacement antenna base for any GMC product, as long as you use ACDelco antenna 22876544, which is 7mm.
B005ESIHOY|4|I ordered these from Amazon and receicved them a few days later.  Three (3) of the liners fit perfectly but not the Driver's due to the fact that I've got an Elentra GT (hatchback) model.  The difference is in one of the corners.  since the GT does not have a lever for the trunk or gas door release on the floor, the cutout is there, but you don't need it.
B002Q3BJIG|3|I like the look of sticker but hate how quickly the color faded.  It changed from brilliant orange-red to dull peach in less than two weeks.
B00CH8QQ24|5|We have done a side by side between this cargo mat and the weather tech and this one takes the cake! Its the ability to fold up and store when the third row is used that makes the difference, its light weight but seems very durable.
B000ZD21LI|5|Though small, this clock is very useful estimating arrival times without taking your left hand off the bars.  On the FarBoy the perfect location is on top of the center cap of the forks.
B000ALDQXC|5|Work like a charm - I have the Grand Cherokee window and hatch both with these shocks. The window, make sure you have the right for the Right Side. I was sent two Right sides, so had to improvise and make the wrong one fit on the Left side. Other than that - wonderful!<br /><br />It is amazing that something so small can hold that heavy tailgate open. No more bonged head or back. Infact, now the window almost opens on its' own. The tailgate holds in place like it did when new.
B00CB1O38G|5|Super bright!!!! Fast shipping!!!
B001C6GQQ8|5|The hitch was installed on a 2010 Toyota Rav4.  This hitch is a class III which will accomodate most everyone's needs.  The bolt holes lined up perfectly with the existing holes in the vehicles frame.  The entire installation took about 30 minutes with two people.  While is doesn't have the amount of contact points that the OEM hitch does, it is a beefy hitch.  So if you don't want to pay the $500-$750 dollars Toyota wants for theirs, then this is a great alternative.
B00G4CT0TU|5|Made well. I purchased it for my husband.  Great buy. Took several weeks to receive it. Came directly from China.
B00164QBKM|2|Does not remove scratchs like it states it will.  Used a lot of elbow grease then tried a drill at low speed with a buffing pad.  Did not touch the scratchs and they were very light scratchs.  Not recommanded.
B00914AL0A|4|They look like the regular seats, most people have no idea that they are a cover
B002J7VWWC|5|I purchased a boat that was uncovered for 6 years , I gutted all of the wood flooring and carpet , but the fiberglass was black with oxidation . A new air compressor,a couple of medium buffers , some oxidation remover ... and these Meguiar's cutting pads turned the boat white again .
B00WS3P37C|4|We have a large garden, berry bushes, a small orchard and landscaping plants so we do a lot of watering in the summertime.  We can never have enough hoses and sprayer heads/watering nozzles!<br /><br />This Blusmart watering nozzle is just what we look for in a spray nozzle - metal housing (resists breaking down in the hot sun), and seven adjustable water settings (everything from a gentle shower to a hard blasting stream), and a comfortable, easy to squeeze handle.  I've been using it for watering over the last week and it's done great.  No leaking around the handle, and no hand cramps from having to squeeze too hard.  It also has a metal loop that holds the handle &#34;on&#34; if you're doing a big job that takes a while.<br /><br />The only downside of this nozzle is that the user has to install an included adaptor to make it fit on a standard American 5/8&#34; hose.  It's not a big deal to snap it on, and it didn't leak or cause any problems, but for this item to be marketed in the USA, it should fit standard American hoses without any adjustment.<br /><br />I received a complimentary Blusmart watering nozzle for testing and review purposes. I wasn't asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item. Look at the hundreds of reviews I've written over ten years and you'll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.
B001C3GH0G|2|These are very bulky.  The liner was difficult to get in and out. Fit and quality was good. I would have problems carrying these on the cycle if I wasn't wearing them.
B003IY5YLA|5|Very nice
B0042H6BA0|3|Currently on our third venture with this bag in less than a month and it has poured rain on all three trips. The bag itself remains waterproof which is great; however the water pouring into the car where the straps enter is quite an inconvenience. We have taken to wrapping baby diapers around all the entry straps to collect the water.
B0036FHDVA|5|Just like the factory.
B000B6JJUK|5|It works great, easy to program. Love all the features. Has a nice bright screen, flashlight just incase. plus it can be programed to remember how much air your tires need.
B004NNMN9Q|4|Purchased this tray for our annaul cigar weekend, and it has certainly held up just fine to our torture.  It is solidly built, with no quality issues, and everything was as described.
B00ARNIDO0|5|Bought this for my daughter's car.  It's a fun and funky way to show your Doctor Who fandom.  Will purchase another when needed!
B0031I3TNI|5|Easy fix for 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo brake light problem. Assembly came with sockets and bulbs already installed. Installation was perfect . . . just plug-in and go. You can buy assembly without sockets and bulbs, but that would cost more money overall, so unless you just bought sockets and bulbs, this is your best value. Shipping was extremely fast with free shipping. Wish I had ordered long time ago instead of just trying to replace bulbs only, but really the price finally came down to reasonable amount we could afford.
B0020KWCTA|5|MADE THE CAR LOOK 2 YEARS NEWER
B0007TJ7GW|3|I thought I was getting the 3rd bar in my order but I must have misread. Purchasing the optional bar separately is relatively expensive.<br />The bars are easily adjustable for width which is nice. However, there is no way to lock them in place. Labs learn to knock them out of the way and stick their heads through. Eventually they will be motivated enough to force their whole body through. I'll be rigging up my own solution to that issue.<br />Otherwise, the gauge of metal used and other hardware seems stronger than other no-name barriers I've had.
B001K7TZ6C|5|excellent
B002ZS4QCS|4|This item is great for me for my car.
B009QVXTTI|5|This works really well at night and in direct sunlight. Fit's on visor very good and is not in the way when we are not using it.  Great product. Shipping was very fast considering it came direct from China.
B0023E59IY|1|This things dont fit on my 2008 mazda 6. The one on the gas pedal is too big and the one that goes on the break is too small .. this sucks
B00CQ8SNL2|4|My kit sank another inch after the first year.
B0014YC3EC|5|Drive a 2008 Tacoma.  Best blades I have ever purchased.
B009M08UCY|5|Excellent wipers
B00280BA4A|2|One of the hub ring cracked after the first time it was mounted. Could be due to lug bolts being over torqued, but still prefer a better quality hub rings that would hold better. Buyer be aware.
B0030DIURE|5|Great fit and easy install, would not use any other brand, these are far superior to the auto parts store brands.
B004MEBENM|4|All good stuff.
B00332GO8O|5|I received the truck rail caps in 2 days after I placed the order. They arrived on time and were of great quality. They were easy to install and looked great on my truck after I had installed them. Will be proud to purchase from this company again whenever I need parts for my vehicles. Thanks a lot.
B004EB9A5M|4|Loved this key chain when it arrived.  It is solid and very masculine to the point that I realized that I did not need all of the other junk I had on my old key ring.
B002IQ889E|5|Received the order, thanks. Good product, good luck to you.  все замечательно, очень признателен,  рад вашему сотрудничеству, буду рад вашему процветанию)
B00G620ZVU|5|Easy hookup and pretty bright. Took me less than 30 minutes to replace my old KC lights with these. I would buy them again.
B009DJU5U4|5|Looked exactly like the factory original, and fit was perfect. Couldn't be happier with the purchase, especially at this price.
B000CLQPZG|2|I bought this muffler from Amazon on March 22, 2010.  I installed it in early April 2010.  It is January 2012 and bottom of the muffler in both the front and the back of the muffler is actively peeling and bubbling from rust, it is coming apart and the muffler sounds somewhat louder than when new.  I am sure it won't last another year.  The stock muffler lasted almost 11 years.  So if you like replacing your muffler every 2.5 years, get this muffler.  I live in the rust belt, if you live where it never snows, maybe it will last longer.<br /><br />The outside is obviously NOT stainless steel.  I have contacted Walker and will see if this actually has a lifetime warranty or even what they mean by that warranty.  I'll update this review after they respond to my contact.<br /><br />Since I first reviewed this, I contacted Walker which told me Amazon will honor the lifetime warranty on this muffler.  Sure enough, Amazon sent me a new muffler and a return slip for the old one.  Amazon sent the new muffler first so I didn't have to drive around for two days with no muffler.  5 stars for Amazon customer service.  Hopefully, the new muffler will last longer but at least if I have to change it I am just out the price of the gasket and some time.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, I'm out.  My POS walker mid pipe fell off the rear flange after 2.5 years, it was wide open.  I paid a muffler shop to weld in a piece since I was on the road and needed to get home, but the first guy wanted to cut the muffler pipe and I said no but he had already made a cut which I didn't notice.  So I bought a used OEM mid pipe in excellent condition and had to then buy a used muffler in excellent condition from CA.  Similar price but all is stainless steel including the flanges.  I got almost 11 years out of my originals.  I guess it would have been ok to keep replacing the muffler every two years but I wasn't going to pay a shop to weld the cut which would have rusted even faster.<br /><br />My advice is unless you can replace your own mufflers, these Walker exhaust parts are not worth it because they are complete junk.  They are annoying even if you do replace them because it's a new gasket every time (only $5 though) and the time, which isn't long, it's just that these are awful quality.
B00DFBAKQK|4|its the second time i purchased this, its awesome for making your helmet look dope. my helmet fell a few times and the spikes didn't budge. durable.
B000C5E8VA|5|I thought it was the hose to the heater from inside of the radiator but was not so did not work .<br />Was totally different from what I needed.
B00FM7POF2|3|Charges the battery.
B008PWQW5M|4|use this helmet while riding my snowmobile and can keep the visor all the way closed without any fogging at all,seems to make a whistle sound alittle bit threw the vent around 100mph but i do recommend this helmet for the price
B005N53C9I|5|These seat covers are the best! So cute, comfortable, and adds a lot of color to the car! So glad I ordered :)
B001C6L6FE|4|Fit right in my vehicle with no problems.
B0053ZL3KI|4|I would recommend this bumper sticker to any Washington DC sports fan. It may not be the most durable bumper sticker, however it will last a decent amount of time and will look great while doing it. I have had mine on my laptop for about 5 months and it shows no signs of wear and tear, I am not sure how well this sticker would hold up on the back of a car.
B005NLQAHS|4|this bluetooth obd2 scanner works fine for a 2008 Highlander  and a 2008 Civic LX coupe...incase someone wants to know if it works for these cars, u need to get the android app torque.
B0009ILZAW|1|This product I bought for a customer of mine after I saw all the good marketing and information they provide.  When it came to the product itself, they should have spent half on marketing and the rest on making a half descent product.  My customer had his original one broke and we got one of these to replace it.  The replacement went back after 4 months.  No big deal, until I find out there warranty is 90 days.  So, I get another one, and actually glue the ends shut so no water can get in.  The first one we could see where water was in there and shorted it out.  The next one lasted just short of 6 months.  Not good at all considering the truck it is on is garage kept.  So if you want a good product, do not buy this one.
B000BZL08U|3|Both of the O2 sensors i ordered were missing the &#34;connection system&#34; , and unfortunately i didnt have time to ship them back and exchange. The sensors worked great, i had to wire them with wire connectors and electric tape i had in the garage.
B003E0UZGW|4|Very good tool I wished I had purchased it sooner. It's good to Know what the codes are before you take the vehicle to the shop for repairs.
B00CGK0P4S|5|excellent product with an excellent design. If you want to keep your vehicle carpet NEW, these are the way to go. They rinse off easy. No one drop of water or dirt will ever see your new car carpet until you sell it or trade in.

B008L5J5G6|4|This tailgate latch was east to instal, I think it took all of ten minutes, I watched a video on youtube and it was a snap. with the lock nuts that come standard you have to go slow and easy, but no problems, thanks for a great product.
B004KEFE1W|5|the pump works very well and the can does not leak when tipped over.  Has a quality feel to it
B0000AZ78A|5|great replacement
B002OHN5NQ|2|The CTEK 56-261 Comfort Connect 3/8&#34; Eyelet was really an M8 (8mm) model.  The eyelets had to be enlarged with a dremel tool to make it fit a 3/8&#34; post.  Don't try to drill out the eyelet or you'll probably destroy the connector.  Grind it out instead.  It seems to work fine once it fits the post.  I only gave it two stars because I don't appreciate being mis-lead by the description.
B0052KI59Q|5|Can't believe the cover worked so great in the first snow storm round here. Kept the windshield clear all night for the next morning.
B0027A5L3M|5|My TIMKEN bearing was actually an SKF bearing, which is an excellent bearing. It was the same bearing as the original OEM bearing my Honda Odyssey came with from the factory. I have been using Timken bearings in trucking and on my personal stuff for years. Great high quality bearings.....
B00AF67MSC|5|awesome I didn't think the rubbersealint stuff that's molded though out the strip that's covering everything on the strip like the glue I guess will melt cause I put one under my hood and had to shift it a little to make it work but other than that awesome product s***s awesome works well remotes kinda on low end of qual. but still works well and watch were u put the control box it can over heat and might not turn on and if it does it wont turn off till it cools or u go to were u plugged it in and disconnect it.
B006RNE77Q|5|Very cool product, after a three-day experiment to color lighting seems to me like a German car.<br />Not as strong as the original bulb 4700-4300 as excellent but for me<br />I added pictures of my car during the day and night, one of Holden WMV and branded in the Arabian Gulf as Caprice.<br /><br />I would recommend this seller.
B00029NDGW|3|Product took a while to take effect and left an oily residue.
B0029XAJW0|5|Easy to put on my car window, stays on nicely. Actually lasted through a bunch of salt getting on it from the road during a snow storm. Love the decal.
B00I82C2MG|5|Excellent product for alot cheaper. Strong and looks good. Shipping was VERY prompt!
B006P88TJ0|5|Great item. Perfect! Just what I was expecting
B001FXL4Q0|5|Easy to install. I used self tapping sheet metal screws. Used to protect an older cars wiring after an alternator upgrade. Well built
B0015PMQDI|4|Works as described.
B000UVUAFO|3|Good product for light scratches and beginners , but for professionals it is worthless
B009YR00L4|5|It does NOT come w/a detachable flashlight as described , BUT the light that is provided is bright .<br />but it does NOT detached  .  I still love the unit
B000CQDQ7Q|4|This part fit right out of the box with the exception of the eye-bolt connectors on the end.  My need required the hole to be 3/8&#34; and the existing hole was 5/16&#34; (or so).  The connector was easily drilled out to the larger size and everything is working well.
B00141KZO0|5|just like the original. 2009 Jetta Sportswagen 2.5. Installed in 10 minutes (I had to see how this new kind works, plus the angle of the hook is new, too).
B00A1O72TW|5|iDiagnose is the most perfect scanner tool I have ever experienced. It is so small but works like a boss. Salute it !! Bluetooth and Wireless both works fine and awesome. It is a perfect OBD2 scan tool as well as car code reader. It works nice through android mobile and tablets. Also works great with windows with the given driver. I loved it so much. Must try !!!
B001KSGFPK|5|Works 100percent so happy
B000CSINYK|5|Great for use as a solvent trap for cleaning my guns. It works well in every way. no leakage and no noise.
B000GVD0VE|2|I have 2 of your travels trunks. 1 of them has lasted for several years without incident. I bought this second one and installed it when I bought my additional scooter. I thought the mounting piece seemed of a different quality plastic but I figured it was fine. To be clear, I have this trunk solely for storing my helmet in while it is parked, and I have never NOT worn a helmet while riding. Today while driving over a manhole cover on the road, not a big hole, not some huge bump, just a man hole cover. I only drive about 3 miles in any direction I go and I drive the same route nearly every day.  About 20 minutes ago, I heard a strange sound, so I turned around and my trunk was on the ground. I was confused and turned around and picked up my trunk. And I found the mount has completely snapped.The trunk itself is perfect fine, seemingly without a scratch. Which make sense since I was only going about 5mph IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION AFTER STOPPING!!.<br /><br />I could understand if I had something heavy in the trunk and was driving through the woods, but neither of those scenarios have every occurred with my Zuma.  Again, the box is empty 100% of the time when the scooter is moving. My question bluntly put, what are you going to do about this?<br /><br />Their response, Which was prompt:<br /><br />&#34;Once the item has been installed, any defects due to use or wear are covered under manufacturer warranty.<br />We are just a retail outlet, and we do not offer any warranties of any kind.<br />You can contact Emgo directly to process your warranty.<br />We apologize for any inconvenience<br /><br />Brendan<br />Customer Service&#34;<br /><br />So they do NOT stand behind the products they sell. They simply defer to the manufacturer with no assistance.
B000E3EXD8|4|I bought this pair of front seats as well as a backseat &#34;bench&#34; cover. The front seats fit pretty well. The fabric is soft and pleasant. The color matches my light gray interior. I look forward to sitting on these covers and maintaining my car's interior.
B007Y1PQQG|3|ok
B0049ZJEEK|4|It fit.  Will need to run the engine for a few thousand miles to see if it lasts as long as the original.
B00GA76MYA|5|Yeah, I love this product.  It applied really easily and looks so awesome.  Great buy for any Star Wars fan.
B00C6MTD0S|5|Good quality & price. The only compaint is that an inner boot was packaged in box instead of an outer boot.We had to reuse the old boot.
B0023VKXDI|5|I purchased the fog light assembly and it was the exact match to the original gmc fog light that came with my truck.I should of bought the set because it looks newer than the driver side,but all in all it was here shortly after i ordered it,and was the same unit that i replaced.
B0000AXCSP|5|Love the Loadhandler. Sure would have been great to hear about it much sooner. It really saves time and effort--- and my back!
B0055DOCHO|5|Good for all sorts of clamping. Like zip ties but better !
B00MOMADZY|5|This gave our seat belt just enough height for my daughter to be able to buckle herself when she sits in her booster seat.
B001G98UPG|5|Fast delivery and Great price. I would highly recommend.
B000SBCHCA|5|As expected. Thanks.
B001DUKIGM|5|Great!!
B00NVTYPF8|2|I just installed the light, seems to be made well and attractive, as far as brightness, I have a set of Pro Comp 2.5 inch LEDs on my windshield that are brighter, but they are OK as far as brightness, could be brighter. No instructions at all, lucky I have installed several light kits and new what to do, not that bad, would be fairly easy for a 1st timer, just go slow and take your time. My light bar was installed on the front bumper between a set of KC Lights and I have a set of Pro Comp lights on the windshield, this is on a Jeep Wrangler.  Update!!! The light have a sever short in the fixture, at the wiring by the light, now they don't work! You might want to avoid this light!!!
B00473VO92|3|This product does not fit the 2 door coupe 2011.  It is for 4 door. The actual tail lights looked awesome.  Too bad.
B001DRJN5M|5|Filter appears to be of good quality for the price. I would recommend it. Cost was less than Fram. Filter material appears to be the same.
B005E39NS8|5|Excelente item
B004JO9O78|2|Below average plastic quality but fair price
B00ASY29AM|5|I have a 2013 VW Touareg TDI with the factory tow package and the Pollak round 7-pin socket attached underneath the rear bumper. I rented a 5x8 U-Haul trailer that had LED lights which had the 4-pin connector. This adapter worked perfectly. When you have the adapter plugged into the 7-pin socket, because of the factory tow package, the vehicle recognizes that something is connected and will not engage the power tailgate. Remove the adapter from the plug to return the power tailgate to normal operation.
B005MKX2TY|1|Our family bought three of these to help the kids access their seat belts.  First, we were surprised by the EULA that states we use these extenders at our own risk.  We went ahead and tried them and found that all three extenders, if you pull hard enough the seat belt will come out.  Returning.
B0071I37IG|5|Worked great on the truck.
B00480J5CW|5|I wanted a bulb that gave a better beam pattern. I used this bulb as a replacement for a 9005. It did require a slight modifcation to one of the locating tabs.Don`t know if it may have a shorted life span as it has not been in service very long.
B000WHACHC|5|I have a 2010 CRV with that ridiculous drop down center console, which is totally just a waste of space and offers no storage at all.  I'll say right off the bat that I didn't purchase this at amazon, but at my local big box store, but I'm reviewing it here because I simply trust Amazon reviews myself more than the big box store's.<br /><br />Once I got the OEM Flip down tray out, this TSI product just slid into place like it was designed for it.  The black and gray is a perfect match for my interior.  I did have to take a pair of tin snips to the bottom to carve out a slight channel where the unit sits over a small hump on the floor, but the snips made quick and easy work of that.  This comes with two screws to secure it to the floor, but I didn't even bother, it's such a good fit and with that slight, carved divet for the hump it isn't going anywhere.<br /><br />I love the design, front and rear cup holders, a VERY generous covered bin.  I've read criticisms of the lock, but I didn't buy this for security, but for storage, so that's no matter for me.  I also was pleased to find the front coin slots were in order, quarters on the right, then slots for dimes, then nickels, then pennies, making it really simple to reach down and pull out what you need knowing they're in order.<br /><br />I really couldn't be happier with this.  I looked at an actual Honda replacement console and it was over $300, so for the price this was perfect.  It transformed the interior of my CRV and appears to be original equipment....only better than the original sad little drop down tray.  Highly recommend.
B000765MHI|4|Larger and louder than expected.
B0006303PS|5|Looks nice under the hood.
B000AMPIXM|5|Exactly what I expected....love it! Excellent quality.
B00P8ALB7I|5|I purchased this for my Father. He owns a 2005 Crown Victoria. He parks in a very small shed with low clearance. He was afraid the factory antenna was going to break. I found this to fit a Ford F-150 which I own. Before I purchased this I removed both antennas and found them to be the same. After receiving this item I tested it on my truck and it worked perfectly. I put it back into its original packaging and gave it to Dad for Christmas. He was thrilled. Of course I had to install it for him that day!
B003EOZMLG|3|I bought these not realizing they are made in China. They work great but are heavy. I think I will opt for Aluminum if I want to change or do another Jeep.
B00HDFF5AA|4|I've had Husky. I've had WeatherTech. The reason I come back to Husky is two-fold. First, when I write them, they answer me. I wrote WeatherTech three times with a complaint. They never responded. Once they had my money, they didn't give a rats ass about me. So they won't get money from me again. The other reason I prefer Husky, is that spikes on the back hold the mat in place very well. The WeatherTech passenger liner in my 2015 Ford Escape just slid out from under your shoes when you got in. Terrible design. So the reason I didn't give Husky 5 stars? The carpet hook holes. Mine looked like they had been reamed out by some horribly old drill bit. Lots of shredded material around the hole. And as other have stated, the holes are no where near big enough for the hooks. You end up tearing the liner material if you try to force them through. Jeep uses holes that are over 1&#34; in diameter for their mats. Husky used about 7/16&#34;. I ended up using a special drill bit for PVC which is very sharp, to enlarge the holes. Unfortunately, one hole wandered a bit and took out a bit of the surrounding moat wall at the back of the hole. But it's still usable. I disagree with reviewers saying that the hook holes are purposely small to keep water from leaking through. There's a moat wall around the hook hole for doing that.
B005V9NSE0|1|did not fit my model<br />has it was specified
B000CF6RX2|5|Installed on my 2015 f350 super duty, they look great with easy installation.
B001TYMK1S|4|true to picute but hard to install at first. once your figure out the first one you are ok, but no directions make it a little difficult
B0050SFZBG|5|Gets the job done quickly and with out damaging the hose. Using round ended needle nose pliers help get the tool to work better.
B00KLZ65GM|5|Works great to keep your face warm
B0007TJ7E4|5|The floor mats were perfect for my 2007 Nissan Murano - they fit perfectly and they matched the beige interior.  I highly recommend these.
B0009H51O4|5|i dont see a difference in certain things between this and \\"premium\\" air filters, get the cheapest one. It does the job, just make sure you install it right and you are good to go!  would you buy 1000 plastic spoons? or 150 premium plastic black spoons for the same price?? THEY ARE GETTING REPLACED ANYWAYS!!!    toyota 2001 corolla.
B002S97BM6|3|Despite reading and reviewing, the &#34;Custom Fit&#34; well, isn't custom fit. The front is way too short and only if something falls directly into the middle does it actually protect as well as it says it does. It's &#34;okay.&#34; I will be upgrading to a better design as soon as I can re-sell this one.
B00WQ37ZXY|1|Poor quality. It was not a solid color, had lines running through it. Cheap looking is a better comment.  Something I would not dare display
B0068OZ020|1|No really i tried to fix it but didn't work. .maybe I'll check on line for others instructions. .
B009FS5VOI|5|Awesome quality!!! Direct fit, take off the old one bolt on the new and you're done. Really cool because i didnt know light mount came on the grill guard.
B000BQSIWK|4|This small unit has worked quite well and appears to have rehabilitated one battery that I had thought was a total loss,
B005LW5K5M|5|fit good
B004IUSA7S|5|This sticker looks great on my truck it is perfect. The color of white on a tinted window is great
B00F675WNW|5|Fit perfectly, took no time at all to put in and solved the P0010 and P0011 code in my Pontiac Solstice GXP (2.0 Turbo).
B0091X0ULG|5|Awesome, just what I was looking for at a good price!!!!!!! Great service!!!! If you are looking for this, this is the place to buy!
B000CPAW2O|5|Nice looking finish, easy to install, good price.  What else could you ask for?
B0052FRXXA|1|These handles do not pull back far enough to release the locking mechanism.  After closer inspection I realized they were not made exactly like my original Camry handles.  In order to get them to work properly I had to bend the metal rod in the door that connects the handle to the lock release.  I would not recommend this product.
B000CMHNY2|5|This worked perfectly to mount my jack to the side of my CJ7.  Holds it nice and tight, no slop at all...very easy to install.
B00FM006I4|5|Good collection of tools. Bag comes with velcro backing to stick to car's trunk interior. Good set to just buy, put in trunk and forget, and hopefully not need.
B001CF1A6U|3|These are nice D-rings.  I was disappointed that they were made in china.  I would have thought that the decription would have said that.  This may have influenced my decision to purchase them.
B0031HC8S6|5|Quality was good, install was simple, it's doing its job well. That's all I could ask for!
B00EPKV7OE|5|I love these,  They are truly Spot lights, not like many that claim Spot / Flood  a Description that is useless and only valuable to sellers so you can't return them because they were not the Spot or Flood that you wanted.  These reach out farther than my High Beams. They are well finished and look like they will hold up.  Haven't yet tested them to see if they will hold up and seal in the rain at 75 to 90MPH. These are for my older truck that doesn't have fog lights and I will buy more for my Harley when it warms up enough to ride again.<br /><br />Since I reviewed these, I now have them installed and have driven with them over 3,000 miles, much of the time in rain and snow conditions, and most of that driven where the speed limit is 80MPH on Freeways in low populations areas in the West.  Absolutely no problems and although I had mounted them low in the bumper, they still reach out as far as my High Beams and double the light of my Low Beams.  They are particularly great when it is raining and the wet road eats your light.
B0045LC9JU|5|As expected. Very Satisfied.
B000IYR7QI|5|Fit perfectly, works like a champ 2003 Camry 2.4L
B000K01TN2|5|Sound is awesome, cheap and was easy for my machanic to put on.  He had to flare out the pipe where he cut off the old muffler  and then used a clamp.  That was 8 months ago. Still running strong.  Have them on both side, ordered both from amazon.
B006PPM6BA|5|great fit. great price
B00390X6DQ|5|Mounted this on my 2003 Wrangler Rubicon with the opening facing the windshield and it not only looks great, it does keep moisture and debri from getting in the intake grill. Installs easily and stays put if you clean the surface with alcohol first. Thanks for offering this and with Prime!
B004N6YRDS|1|didn't work at all, might have been my fault but it seems pretty cheaply made anyways
B002M4C7H6|5|PERFECT FIT, EASY INSTALLATION, WOULDN'T HESITATE TO RECOMMEND TO ANYONE
B00BMU9BOI|1|cheap cheap cheap even for Chinese....broke 2 installing them for the first time....waste of time and money.....and you pay to ship the broken ones back...shakeing my head that Amazon carries such junk....this is an edit...3 weeks later....had a flat and had to buy a new tire....installer broke number 3 of 4 hubcaps...they should include a glue gun  with the purchase....good luck
B003LSJJJ6|2|Bought these as a backup pair - first time I wore them it was about 45 degrees out - they fogged up before I could get my helmet on and never cleared.  They might be ok in warm weather but if you ride in any season but summer they will need treatment.
B00CPGQ1GO|2|It's slick hard plastic, nothing supple to it.
B00MDUI7MS|5|Received earlier than expected! Can't wait to try it!
B000UVCK8O|5|Work great and add a very nice touch to the auto interior when opening the door. Would recommend to anyone looking to add a little something special to their interior.
B000O9K836|1|Didn't work as described.  I may have had a poor application in mind for this product.<br />Good packageing and directions
B0019IA41W|1|It worked but one screw holding the module to the bracket was striped I had to use the old bracket.  It is working fine now!
B00ACNBD0Q|5|Very attractive license plate frame for the Infiniti.  Got it as a gift for my step-son, who loved it.  Excellent price--much less than $30-40 cost at local Infiniti dealer.  Comes with chrome nut-covers and was easy to install.  Very good alternative to buying at full retail price.  Order fulfilled promptly and professionally.
B0002X520S|5|Thick solid paste at room temperature like bees wax.  Snow Seal is still solid but more liquid (cheaper in price).  Hard to tell any real difference between the two products other than temperature and ease of use.  Guessing Obenauf's LP Boot Preservative product may be better at waterproofing do to it's thicker nature but when applying this product it and the leather should be very warm, almost like you want a vat of heated liquid bear grease or this stuff to dip you gloves into.  Seriously scooping out a glob  and rubbing it in to leather gloves repeatedly at room temperature works.  Takes several hours after or overnight for the product to be fully absorbed until then they are sticky mess.  Several coats are needed and your gloves will never be waterproof but it far better than nothing at all.  If you want waterproof use rubber gloves over a glove liner.
B003JIDTQW|5|VERY GOOD
B0018RFBJ4|5|awesome!. sealed to keep dirt out before use.
B0020K0DJG|5|Great
B005CIGI6K|5|I've had all manner of sun shades in all kinds of cars.  Even $175 units for my wife's BMW 740 and my 12 cylinder BMW sedan.  I wish I'd been smart and bought these units for about $20 or so.
B0043063JU|5|Very nice! The size is good for camping.
B0040CRTCG|5|Great service & great buy!
B00OH0S5Y2|5|I looked for the LED lights with the best reviews, and then found these that look exactly the same for half the price. Two months in and no problems. They are as much brighter than the OEM incandescents.
B0002Z9O8C|5|Feels solid, and the included wobble-stopper and solid bolt seem to work well after two uses, and a fully loaded thule rack!
B00CH6T18C|4|Not bad. It didn't get some of the older deeper stains off, but I feel with continued use it might.
B007ZQS67G|5|Awesome thanks
B007IO9IA4|5|Great addition to the truck.
B004ZF3ALM|4|So I ordered the 12000k 9006 and it was right size and stuff yet the color was more like 8000k. There still fine by me I just wanted blue but I wanted deeper blue that's why I gave 4 stars
B00A3SGHQK|5|The instructions were very simple, A nice addition to you vehicle.  This was a good purchase and would buy again.
B001THNWMQ|5|This stuff is awesome, easy on and off. Will differently get more.
B00BKHPIBS|5|Good
B002R0OIUO|5|Great price and quick shipping.  Used on me 2001 Supercrew.  Looks as good as OEM.
B007BSG760|5|Great unit! I would order again in a heart beat! Will be referring others to buy this unit for their homes!
B007TG7HHC|5|I love these wipers, my old ones made horrible noises when using during light rain. The are absolutely silent as they work.
B001T6FC34|5|ARP. Enough said. They are the standard in excellence for fasteners in the industry. There is no better than this.
B00HB8SVO6|5|I like this I will buy again.
B00NWF5RUI|5|works great  easy to program
B002SJH6NU|5|They have done wonders for my trucks very tired leaf springs.  It picked my truck up about 3.5in from what it was before.<br />Like the other poster said I had to remove the clips and such.  It was not fun. But needs to be done.  I wish that the directions mentioned that... But oh well....
B005CQ0FA2|5|received in good condition...applied easily
B000E3CYJ8|3|I know this isn't what I should be doing but I need to know the size!! I understand it says it fits most but who knows? It possibly couldn't fit and end up a waste of money, my steering wheel is aftermarket that's why I'm asking, I have a 13 1/2 inch diameter steering wheel... Will it fit?
B003BLSPN4|4|It really is a pleasure to drive now that I have this leather wrap on my steering wheel. It is more than just good looks, it is a safety issue. I would have given 5 stars, but the instructions said 1 hour. This is absolutely impossible. You have to wear leather gloves when installing this thread to be able to pull it tight. It took me 4 hours to do this correctly and I am a aviation tech.
B00CTSNO4K|4|Looks really great on the trailer hitch.  if I had one con, I guess it is a little bigger than expected.  But once on my truck for a little while, it looks great.
B007P4IUJW|1|Boss Powersports sent me the wrong Carb rebuild kit, and as a result my bike was out of service for the entire riding season.  They responded to my one star review asking what they could do to rectify the situation and I told them that a simple refund would be fine(a measly $30), they demanded pictures of all the parts, as well as invoices, and other info.  Who keeps tiny unusable O-rings after you've removed them and they're covered in oil that leaked through, And the packaging they came in?  Without this they refused my simple request with a bitter and scathing attitude.  I will NEVER buy another item from them and I urge you not to either.
B00EKV5KE6|4|Ok first off this grill looks amazing and saved me a ton of money. I gave it 4 stars bc of the fitment issues. I have installed 20+ fuel grills on trucks at my shop and all fit perfect. This one was not bad but having it completely flush did cause a little bit of bow at the top so i had to cut a lot more of the grill off than i wanted to. All in all i didnt expect it to be perfect but for what i paid its awesome! It changes the whole look of the front end. Gives it an aggressive look and I'm please. Definetly recommend.
B001FHZYE4|1|Bolted right up in a 4 cyl Honda Accord, looks almost identical to stock starter, pretty easy install.  It worked flawlessly for 2 or 3 weeks, then one morning the starter motor got stuck and would not shut off.  It just kept spinning, started smoking and quickly burned itself up (major fire hazard).  Not sure what kind of damage it has caused to my transmission... Guess, we'll see when I install a decent starter and fire it up.  Sent this garbage back to amazon.  Cheapest one I could find... obviously cheap ain't always the best way to go... when will I learn this?
B000KSTCGU|3|Had a difficult time getting the splitter to stay square on the nut that I was trying to break.  Did enough damage though that I could get an air chisel to finish the job.
B004MG923E|5|I purchased the decal to put on my motorcycle. We applied the decal to the tank and it looks great.  The only negative with the decal is that it didn't come with instructions and they would have been helpful.
B004C02CSC|5|Should a done this long ago
B00CQLJ6K6|2|did not fit my Ford F-150 as advertised, and it is poorly made. The eye ball sprayers were loose in the sockets.
B00BT1GUNK|5|A fantastic and affordable way to repair an extremely common volkswagen problem. If your key just turns in the door, this is probably the issue. The kit contains everything pictured,  spring, retaining clip, actuator rod, etc. I'm not sure who the manufacturer is, but the materials definitely seem better than OEM. The only issue I had was it is tricky to put everything together. When the old pieces are broken, it's hard to tell what way they go back. Maybe at least a diagram of the order of assembly with the kit would be a nice addition.
B0033WNJBO|5|I should have had better tools to drill the necessary holes, but that's my failing, and not the hitch.  Excellent hitch.  Very solid.  Easy enough to install.
B00CMFF1AA|5|Works great and no issues to report at this time.
B001RLOI1S|5|Replaced the stock plugs on my 2009 Mini S at about 69k miles due to a mild sluggishness that only I noticed (friends thought I was crazy).  After replacement, car ran like new!
B006PHX504|5|Very pleased With the pricing in the speed of delivery
B000BRFQLK|5|Great product A++.
B008G3IV2M|5|This was a perfect addition to our scan tool that is mounted in a cart and has too short of a cord to do anything with.
B006NSN7OE|5|When I'm at the gun range everyone loves the saying lol. Great sticker and quality.
B0002STSQM|4|Made in USA, all metal parts, scale marks are bigger and more visible than competitors. Happy.
B000C846MI|5|LOOKS GREAT ON THE VEHICLE VERY HAPPY ON THE OUTCOME OF IT WILL DEFENETLY ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN IT FIT LIKE A GLOVE
B001FJDAZC|5|Inexpensive part for my rear truck door and it was on in under 10 minutes.
B000SOIRCG|5|I use this for straining gasoline for all small engines which can be temperamental anyway.  You can often see the stuff it filters out.
B009HVPV4S|5|Easy to use.  Easy to read and/or erase engine codes. Storage case is great for carrying and protecting this product.
B004OK6A9W|5|As advertised, fixed the broken one,speedy shipping.
B000C5YCZ2|5|Installation was easy + check engine light problem was resolved instantaneously in my Lexus RX 300 jeep.  I strongly recommend it
B00AFRJ1B2|5|It's a K&N, so it filters like it should.  I replaced a Green's filter on my 6.0 diesel and this is WAY better quality.
B00CF97LN8|5|Shipping was quick. Decal looks awesome on my truck. Small and subtle but big enough to get your point across. I'm about to order 3 or 4 more as gifts.
B003RVUZIG|5|Love this remote! Very easy to program and very affordable!
B001OZQEHI|5|love this stuff! great smell....it has a cinnamon smell followed by a bubble gum scent. So i 'was' using turtle wax ice since like 2007, but recently the bottle changed and I'm thinking the product inside also changed. ICE Spray detailer was all you needed way back when, but now something is definitely off. Anyways.....that was the reason i changed to Lucas Oil Speed Wax.....so awesome! goes on simply and wipes off without a smear, smudge, or streak! (unlike the blue stuff above) I'm so happy with this product! 2014 BMW M3 Looks great after a wash, but looks even better after spraying entire car with this stuff. Thank you Lucas for an amazing product.<br />(I didn't buy here, but at advanceauto with retailmenot coupon netted me $6.50/ bottle)
B0036E81OY|5|Air intake works amazingly and definitely increased the sound, Nice little performance boost as well. Truly would recommend this to anyone looking for simply modifications.
B001QI7ITG|5|fits perfectly
B008ZY3QWC|4|Looks to be good quality I just got them on the bike they fit good know I am just waiting for summer
B001AKOFMI|5|I love this decal, but you must be patient putting it on. I have a Chevy Avalanche, and I put it on the rear window.  It turned out to be the perfect size for that window, and likely would have worked out just as well on the front.
B003S8B352|1|I have a 2001 mustang gt, this key is not fit!! It is a junk!
B00YML13OU|5|I love these magnets.  I have a teen learning to drive, and they are very helpful.  They stick on great and are reflective.  I was searching for something like this, and even though I received these at a reduced price, I would have paid full price for them.  I think they should be required for all student drivers.
B008O4WJNK|5|It was exactly the decal it showed in the picture and it look great on my truck. I will recommend it.
B0040CWY58|4|arrived as described.
B00FH8P1DG|1|Extremely disappointed this light is not waterproof ended up getting moisture in it and not as bright as other brands
B00KTHXO2U|5|Exact replacement for 2010 Tundra and do require owner to have programmed by Toyota Dealer.
B00DJDXL5Q|5|I've been looking for a bag that I could mount on the luggage rack behind the sissy bar on my cruiser mainly to hold a  second helmet. Tried many, none worked. Finally I found this one and it was worth the wait. The bag is just deep enough to accept a 3/4 helmet. Not sure if it would hold a full helmet but it might. The bag is well made and looks good on the back of the bike. I used bungy cords to mount it to the rack, though the included straps would work also.  The side pockets are handy for extra gear like gloves, etc.  The zipper handles on all three zippers have holes in them to allow small padlocks to be used to stop nosy tourists from &#34;checking out the bag&#34;. Obviously, a thief will be able to slash and run but it's a bag, not a safe.  It has a nice carry handle and if mounted for easy removal, would make a nice little overnight bag. The rain cover is screaming yellow which would make you more visible from the rear in the rain. Very happy with the purchase.
B004J36IAA|4|Everything came in good. And on time.
B001GMTL2Y|5|Great value for the price.  Thanks.
B005SAJ9A4|5|This decorative plate is so cute and affordable. It is also easy to clean and maintain. The delivery was also prompt!
B00NB8TWNO|4|Originally, I purchased this kit to replace the interior lights only.  They look great and everyone loves them.  Later, I attempted to replace the license plate lights, but the LED bulbs were too long.  Still not disappointed.
B003YC6A78|5|hi ,everiting fantastic thanks
B0019I9SB4|5|OEM fit worked great, no problems Waker exhaust is a good line of product will continue to use walker every time
B007VLFA4M|5|Installed in map lights on my truck.  Extremely bright.
B001MXH9FS|5|Well worth the money. A quality product that functions great. Kinda wish I would of got the remote controlled one, but very effective with thermostat
B002UK2GZ0|5|I thought the logo was embroidered but it is more like iron on stickers. Not wearing too bad, but is showing some.
B000S2UVA4|5|This replacement switch is better than the original with an option to turn on/off the headlights via ignition. It took 12 minutes to replace and would buy again.
B0002SA3TS|5|Excellent fit! Windows are very nice too!  Just what I ordered.
B000ALBS0K|4|These work great!  They're a bit awkward to install, kind of bend at a strange angle.  You'll need torx wrench to unscrew the old ones and install the new ones. But they work fantastic and no more holding the gate open with your head.  Took me less than 30 minutes.
B000CB0XSQ|4|There are two different PVC designs used by Subaru around this MY range.  So make sure you visually check what is installed on your car already.  This one fit my 2002 Forester 2.5L SOHC fine.  Honestly I rarely see PCV valves simply fail.  This one was replaced with other tune-up parts and the \\"what the heck\\" factor.
B00HJEZG2C|4|thanks
B00CWFZ4HU|5|Great product. Easy to install
B002DLYR8A|5|Fast delivery, great product.
B0041RPGQ6|2|I am a school bus driver and in the winter mornings the bus is a fridge on wheels for awhile till the motor heats up and starts to warm the bus up. So for me this heated seat pad takes the edge off while I have to sit waiting for the bus to warm up. I found the wiring and the way it is attached to the pad very well done. Not cheap at all. The attachment to the seat, the wire, off low high switch is made durable. I like it warm to hot- but after an hour I need to switch it to low. I was very happy with it as I used it for past 2 weeks with no issues. Has a lot of people saying what I feel in reviews because its a well made low priced item that works.  OPPPPPPPPsssssss look at updated reviews........<br /><br />UPDATE: After a full 3 solid months of use 5 hrs a day this heat pad has performed flawlessly. I bought another one for my daughter and other bus drivers have been buying them as well now that they know how well they work.  Says a lot for this product! Opppppps spoke to soon I may have gotten 3 months of good service from this but the following winter after a few weeks it died... I ordered another one and its lasted 3 weeks before it quit, so I am done with them.
B0038AV968|3|Everything fit together just fine for these headlights. The initial installation went by smoothly. I turned the lights on to check that all the bulbs were working and to adjust the low beams to a good level. I instantly noticed the left parking light (3157) was about twice as bright as normal (the right light was fine). I tried the bulbs that came with the new headlights. I switched those out for the Sylvania SilverStar, then gave the light bulbs that i had just taken off the car a try. All these light bulbs were extremely bright. I thought for a bit, then switched out the wiring of the new headlight assembly for the wiring off the old headlight assembly. So, I now have the new light assembly and old wiring installed. Everything is fine now and the lights look incredible.
B00D8ZFDTM|5|Fit like a glove and easy to install. Looks great....what more can you ask for?
B00806G136|5|Excellent conversion kit. Other kits have blown out on me in months, these bad boys are still going. Brought life to my Chrystler 300c!
B00080QHMM|3|Very accurate.  Easy to use.  After a year of using it, the plastic tip broke off and pressure was used to read accurately.  Overall good while it lasted.
B004BZE45C|5|sound great has a very deep rumbel. also installed airraid intake and that gave exhaust even better sound
B00JVPGV1W|5|These were better than I expected and were easy to install,
B00AQI8SH8|5|product was delivered sooner than expected. product was in great condition and fit perfectly into my 2007 Toyota Camry. Great value!
B002300LOU|5|no complaints. works as advertised, very easy to install.
B00316K61S|4|Just received it and tested it out on my 12V marine battery. Voltage on the battery reading was good! Did the LOAD test and in 5 sec it started to smoke and got a little hot. I think the smoke is mainly from the initial use burning the coils. Tried it again and it didn't smoke, but I didn't Load test it as long. If you test load batteries, I would suggest to let it cool down before testing the next battery to prolong the life. Heat destroys everything and<br />it's made in CHINA! Someone suggested to wear face protection when testing batteries and I do concur! How long will it last??? Is the question..<br />Works great so far!
B00B90J9YI|5|Great product, great price. Installed on a 95 yj. Little bit of fabrication required. Works great though. Definitely worth the price.
B000FW61EW|5|Used this  to stregthen the motor mounts (rubber engine mountings) on my Honda, which was going through motor mounts like there was no tomorrow. Been driving two months and so far the motor mounts are holding. I hope it works for a good long time.
B001F1BC4G|5|Love this purchase. Great quality.
B004K25IC4|3|I got a soft top and haven't even installed this yet.
B000H90XDS|5|Works well for keeping trickle charge on batteries. Does not overcharge.
B009YJGKW0|5|Lights work great.  Plenty bright!  For the price, I think they are a good deal. Amazon says I need 5 more words, so I am typing this sentence.
B00Q34F94E|4|not fit at what i thought.
B0066PXEN8|1|The plastic nut is very cheap and breaks at the least bit of tension. If you are lucky enough to get your headlamps installed with these cheap nuts without them breaking the adjusting screws just stripe right of of the cheap plastic nut and eventually the headlamps come undone. I have been looking for a metal nut replacement, the screw is excellent but will not work without a better nut.
B000JZZDLM|5|Plug wires are direct OEM replacement.  Arrived on time and best price anywhere.  Would purchase again
B00DGZB5GY|5|Easy to install, very bright
B00HB68SD2|4|Very easy to do for someone that is familiar with removing some interior body panels.
B001RIFT7I|3|They are working but I had two that were did not work right out of the package.
B00MIQ4UPU|5|very nice..
B00EVIOOO0|5|Awesome transaction and I love this shallow water anchor.
B00CL2V6VC|5|Item was returned due to a misdignosis from Toyota mechanic.
B00DAXJMJY|5|I installed this plug the other day and my ride started right up.  It even sounded better, or maybe it was just wishful thinking.  Either way, I like it!
B001GH5PX8|5|I used the switch to install fog lamp on my truck. The Switch Kit came with everything I needed and works great even at night easy to see.
B00G1X9ZA6|1|Washers provided did not have the center hole big enough for the cab bolt to go through ended up having to tap them bigger with a drill. two of the bushings had absolutely no use on the vehicle. overall too pricey for the hastle.
B008VSB0DE|5|Made winterizing quick and painless. High quality aluminum, snaps onto the air compressor nicely with a quick disconnect. Standard hose connection on the opposite end. The blue color lets me know its only to be used for the fresh water system.
B000CESEW0|1|Be on the lookout for the newest ford motorsport guideplates.  I have had several sets thru the years, and the latest versions seem to have a slightly different pushrod alignment.  I could not use them, so I installed an old set of Manleys that worked perfectly, the same way the Ford parts used to.  The suffix is different, and they are described as fitting standard 289/302/351 factory heads, but somewhere along the way there has been a little revising, to the detriment of their fit-up.  My old Ford OHO versions from the early 70's, some Ford Motorsport versions from the late 80's, my Manleys, and some new Comp Cams all have same same slot and stud placement.  The new Ford Guideplates, or rather the set I received are definitely a little off.
B001BK7SVC|4|Everything works. My mirror did have heat, but this mirror without heat hooked up perfectly (same connector). The connectors for the heated mirror and the non heated mirror are the same, it is just the wires that are different. The heated and non-heated are interchangeable - but the heat will not work (I cannot tell the difference)..<br /><br />It was easy to paint. I wiped the outside down with brake cleaner, and taped off the mirror, and it painted great with no primer or topcoat using regular touch-up spray paint. You have to get really close to tell that it is not the original.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, the mirror image is a bit distorted. But overall it works fine, and for the price, is only a very minor inconvenience.<br /><br />For the price, this is a cheap and easy fix for a broken mirror. It would be hard to find a better deal in a junk yard.
B00A6FOP0K|5|Product was as-stated. Quality BMW product at a fair price. Nothing more to be said ... the product was exactly what I needed.
B008K4BKMK|5|Product received was as advertised for my 2007 pontiac G6. Installed circuit card from my old remote in about 2 minutes. Works like new now!
B00CANRL66|5|Boots are boots, these are karting boots and do their job well.<br /><br />My only grip is Amazon etc being a bit more clear on the sizes, took me too long to figure out the last 2 numbers were the European size.
B000F0DXSQ|5|it fits and works grate for cant complain i put in on and it just fire up thanks amazon for this product it made my day
B001PJS4LW|3|thought I was getting the hook also. not sure if a &#34;warn&#34; strip is worth the cost
B000CIXMIC|5|no problems installing everything I needed was wit it except I bought new o rings for injectors does not come with bottom insulator
B00OQS2M8K|4|It sticks very well to my hardhat
B00PCHSMW4|4|It is not that hard to install and heats up so you are toasty warm.<br />So far I like it very much.<br />Jim in Ct.
B007BFT5I0|5|This windshield looks great and fits perfect. Easy on and off. Customer service was great to deal with, I would buy from them again with no hesitation.
B00EA2VQ66|5|So freaking happy with how things look!!!
B00CPO4Q6I|5|The sunshade fits my Honda CRV like a glove.  It looks like it was custom made for the vehicle.  The only thing I would change is that you cannot fold it for storage.  You have to roll it up and it takes up quite a bit of room in a small CRV. It would be nice if it could be folded into a more compact package.
B00842A7F4|5|Worked perfectly; arrived ahead of promised time.
B000B68V90|5|Nice I will buy it again. Is durable and resistant to heat i recommended to anyone fixing engine Dupli the best
B00AZXBDUS|5|Perfect match. Blades a little less solid than original, but they fit and work.
B006XY3H48|5|A+++<br />I have to say, this company is AMAZING!  They are WONDERFUL to work with!  They have FAST shipping, the customer service is 100% friendly and I will be buying from them again.<br />I made a mistake and purchased the wrong kit, I am a female after all ;)  and THEY FIXED MY MISTAKE!  They must get a lot of business to do this at no added cost to me!<br />The headlights worked with the relay harness and the warning canceler, my husband has a 2009 Dodge Ram truck, so I will suggest buying that with this kit.<br />Again, did i mention I love this company and the headlights!?
B004SCTWTQ|5|arms arrived on time and work perfectly.
B00AETR5W8|5|Nice cap, would recommend.
B009DJKXFG|5|Great buy i replaced L/R lenses shipping was fast ..and the best feature on the lenses is they are adjustable and easy to line up lights. For good nite time driveing....
B000S2KZXW|1|Wrong part, does not fit 4wd trucks!!
B000C7WWUW|5|Good quality.
B000RN2AHQ|5|I can't say enough about this bag.  I ride a 2008 Yamaha FZ-1.  I purchased this for a cross country tip I had been planning for years.  It made it through rain, high winds, high heat, and the general abuse associated with travel.  It never fell off and is still in great condition.  The only thing I would recommend to a buyer is not relying on the rain cover, pack everything in it in zip lock bags.
B00INVF4PY|4|excellent item
B008HIT07G|5|Excellent!
B0010G81G8|5|pARTS WERE AS STATED AND ARE EXACT DUPLICATES OF THE OOM SWITCHES.<br />These pressure switches are about half the cost of the same parts available locally and do as well.  I would recommend the purchase AND INSTALLATION OF THESE SWITCHES ANYTIME YOU NEED WORKHORSE PARKING BRAKE REPAIR.. Chevrolet does not sell the units any more, they just install the workhorse systems.  Seems like these systems give poor service and I know from experience they will fail and leave  you in the worst of situations.  A couple of spares is a better idea.
B005C2L618|5|i have a black car so no painting needed.  wasn't hard to take door panel off to get at three nuts that hold mirror on.  works fine
B0054YCW62|4|I used it under the cover of my paddle boat to keep water from puddling.  Worked well but did see some color bleeding.
B000W0OFXG|4|Exactly what I wanted, no key for me to lose and it works like it should. I like the molded cover for the dials, should help it last by keeping road crud out of the lock.
B00NMXM76C|4|Will they fit 99 explorer
B000FQ0FR2|4|Fits nice on wrangker yj, need new holes
B00C306YP0|3|Returned because it did not fit my bike honda shadow vt1100. Seemed to be of low quality and i really did not want to trust my life to it. But you get what you pay for i guess
B006GZHJTS|4|Works well, pretty bright brake light.
B0043M68ZW|5|The kit worked just fine, but the problem is I paid 50 dollars to only use one jet.  Price could have been a little better.
B000CMHTZ0|5|very nice hard material
B0057QZPZ2|4|The jack works great, took about 10 minutes to install. My only problems were the lack of new bolts and an actual crank handle were not included, bet they saved a bundle on leaving those out. The crank socket and lock washers were provided though, big whop! As for Amazon people getting off their butts and actually shipping this thing, I have nothing but bad feelings about them. They waited until the day before the last day of the estimated arrival date to ship it. I guess you have to pay some price for the free shipping.
B00EQV4TJW|4|Item as described.
B008X9UV22|5|I have had the bars on my Road star for a bit and I love how they look as well as the comfort they provide down the highway.  The seller was prompt and easy to do business with.  I will do business with them again.  They also mounted to the bike easily.
B002E2YEYK|5|Love these lights!  Don't hesitate to buy them.
B006RWGMWK|5|I searched all over for these filters for my bike. The bet I could find were near $60 EACH! These were not only a great price but they really look sharp too.
B001AWU6KQ|5|Highly recommended
B003Z9T33I|4|This is easy to install... It will do what it's supposed to.. The only knock on it is that it has a minor leak near the cab... Good for the price
B000W0RQ8C|1|Works perfectly.  I understand this barrel type lock may not be a secure as a padlock hanging down but for my usage it's fine.  UPDATE:  After using this for about 2 years I found I could not take it off, first trying the key and spray lube, then a crowbar and finally a hammer - I guess proving that it's good security.  Finally, I had to cut it off using an air grinder with a thin cut-off wheel.
B007QBR5TA|5|Everything fit like a glove. I would recommend Amazon to anyone encluding my family and friends.
B002UVHN20|5|Shipped on time and work great!
B00GSAUHB8|5|I use to live near the equator where car sun shades were almost mandatory. Most of the sun shades I've used in the past were bulky, hard to use and didn't work in all vehicles. This Sun Shade solves all the problems I've had in the past. It is super quick to put up and take down and it really covers a wide range of car, SUV or truck windshields. It works in my car and SUV equally well. I love how quickly I can put it back into the handy pouch. I travel frequently for business, and I've started popping this sun protector in my carry on bag so I can use it the rental car as soon as I arrive.
B0031BLGRG|5|Awesome pipes with an awesome sound.  Easy to install and the instruction are simple to understand.
B0016LE80K|5|I travel a lot and use a standalone GPS and I need to power my phone. A lot of rental cars only have one cigarette lighter plug so I carry this with me in my notebook bag. I have a Griffen dual USB adapter permanently placed in one. [...] It's not permanent but once it's pushed in, it's flush and not easy to get out. I plug my GPS cigarette plug into the other. The phone goes in one USB port and the bluetooth earpiece, camera or other USB device that needs charging goes into the other port. The unit is well built and serves the purpose well. It has also fit well in every car that I've rented. Some 12v plugs don't fit well in some cars but this one has fit well in every car that I've rented.
B00HY3COJG|5|worked as expected. I had used them before, anybody that run big tires should try them, reblances the tire everytime you roll off
B0041CDPQO|5|I bought this to charge my phone on my sport bike.  It fits my phone charger well, actually alot better than the one in my truck.  The cord is plenty long and quality looks good.
B000EVWDU0|5|This item is well built and performs as advertised.<br /><br />I have several of these devices by various manufacturers.  This one is easily my favorite.
B0045XRK06|5|love this lamp.  nice and bright, but wish it was a little more sturdy.  I have to prop something under it to hold it in place where I want it.
B000GOG3FG|5|I bought this blower for my 2004 Honda Civic and it works like a champ.  Perfect fit and easy to install.
B002NR2Z56|5|performed as expected
B0002SR6XE|5|A great solution for getting into the tight spots (like my tractor/shredder u-joints)  I have it dedicated to it's own grease gun so I don't have to change it all of the time, You can't be disappointed in this- GET IT.
B003LZ9P8E|5|My stock LCA bushings were destroyed, so I purchased these to replace them.  The car feels SO much better under spirited driving conditions.  They are a little harsh on rough roads, but I still fully recommend purchasing these.
B001U2D6OO|2|size & brightness is good, but the motion activation does NOT work the greatest. Used for driveway lighting when entering/exiting. moved light twice (still not working nightly) Then the light stopped working! would not come on at all.  I email Amazon & product company (lucky it was,under the 90day warrany) Sent it back to Company at MY EXPENCE.(I should NOT have to pay $10 postage for a defective product) Hope I have better LUCK with the replacement.
B0007SXIZ4|5|Easy installation and works just as expected.
B001SH6Q16|5|Product is new and as described.  Well packed and Shipped quickly.  Very satisfied.<br />Relatively easy to install.  Simply remove the cosmetic trim around the sunroof/headliner opening by starting at the seam and gently pull horizontially.  Then with a screwdrive gently pry the aspirator cap from the headliner.  With screwdriver and flashlight gently pry the headliner from the sunroof opening.  The unit has a couple clips that need to be compressed to remove from the wire harness. Then simply plug in the new unit and replace the cap and trim.
B00MHK963I|5|this is a very nice , it is thick and fits real good. have to pull on it a little to get it on, but not hard at all.
B000CJ914A|4|Fits great on my 13 year old BMW.  However, does not have the same tabs as OEM.  Plastic framing is a little flimsy, and can snap quite easily.
B009LOO1DS|5|Good stuff.
B00HS5DRG4|5|OEM and looks great, easy to install
B0042Z307E|5|Love this mat, just what I wanted for camping.
B000CO7NGI|4|good price, arrived quickly , fit perfectly although the site vehicle matching software said it wouldn't
B001B4C4EY|1|Interested in painting my 1964 Sunbeam Tiger, I'm looking for a source of acrylic lacquer paint, found this company. There are 144 different colors to choose from; the color swatches are a bit small, however.    What isn't so good is the exorbitant amount for postage. Even sent in a large envelope, According to the USPS web site, postage for 3 oz First Class Mail should be $1.22, yet they charged me $4.89! Unusual, usually Amazon controls costs better than this. Cannot recommend the color chart at this price.
B00BU44TOI|5|Can feel the difference
B000DN7Q3S|5|Anyone that has had to hold up their hood with their head will know how great it is to finally replace these supports, although watch out, they spring up pretty quickly when new!! I totally recommend these to everyone that doesnt have a rod to hold their hood open. I got these because of the name and the price.
B0036R1O90|4|Definitely a learning experience when using the kitchen oven to open the headlight housing.  I've been using the lights for a few months now and they work as expected.  They are a bright white color, but not to the point where you could use them by themselves while driving at night.<br />All the pieces came in intact and worked without any issues, even though I was worried the adhesive wouldn't be strong enough to hold the rings to the insides of the housing but it worked with no issues.
B00K7RHW4S|4|Very good product, it seems a bit thin, but if it holds up as well as my last set they will be great.
B006RA2JFG|2|i ordered one,loved it,ordered 2nd one,its like 5inches shorter then first one thought maybe would stretch out,not! Had on ground so to late to send back
B000Q9BD1K|4|It's a simple, but colorful bandana. This was a gift for a motorcycle guy.  He liked it and will most likely use it.
B004KAX1LQ|5|Fits well, not too difficult to install, nice and bright, overall and excellent buy!
B00D8RYGOI|2|Either the light board is bad or a wiring issue on veh. Light worked for a couple of hours as of now very disappointed with purchase.
B0015PK3AG|5|I used this oil socket wrench for a 2008 scion xd. I had previously used a wrench from a brick and mortar store that failed on me on the first try. It literally broke on me while I was under the car.  I ended up returning it and taken the car to the dealer for an oil change. I came here right away after that had happened and came across this wrench.  Let me tell you it's solid and it will hold up to all sorts of torquing.
B006X1TYCA|5|Fit just fine but wish they had the anchors that the originals pads had to keep them from slipping.
B004C443R6|5|The gloves are exactly what I wanted.<br />Rugged enough to be worn while riding my Harley, and fashionable enough to worn while driving a car.
B00HYHXC3O|5|These are the best fit. Perfect. Recommend to anyone who wants good looking mats.
B002AKFA94|3|Very flimsy but does what it is designed to do.
B004HYNG38|5|They came in less than a week. Instructions are easy to follow and they installed in less than 45 minutes. I would recommend these
B000XECJES|5|We love these cloths, and are so thankful to not be throwing away money on paper towels.
B00CNX98V4|5|The build quality is top notch on this product. It fits like factory and is easy to install. Great way to keep your remote in good condition and add some personality.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Mounted one forward and one backwards on the ROP bar on my Branson tractor.  No more working the fields in the dark. Almost like driving in a little circle of daylight.
B00R8QGITG|5|I brought this car jump starter as a gift for my brother’s bday as he is too much into cars… And he absolutely loved it… He said that besides serving as a backup for dead batteries, it also helps charge your phone battery, ..  In addition, it well worked with his bike too.. Nice product!!
B00HY07KOS|5|Great
B002L7G1LW|5|You will have to get behind the grill and feel for the studs<br /><br />Not a sticker ! thick metal and well made.<br /><br />Install on my '04 Avalanche was a task but the front end plastic on the truck forgave me and went right back in place.
B00B7SVB8O|3|The headlights look really nice on the car.  Since installing them I've had 3 friends ask about my new car, they really make a big difference.  So that's a plus.<br /><br />The minus - light output is a bit disappointing.  High beams are OK.  Low beams have a weird beam pattern with a lot of reflection from the chrome headlight body.  I'd replace the lens with an HID retrofit but I'd worry about blinding other drivers.  The LED bar along the bottom is also really dim, nearly invisible during the day.<br /><br />Given the price, they're just fine.  I got them because the wiring on my stock Hella headlights was rotting and I didn't want to pay for new OEM headlights.  I'm happy enough with them but if you're looking for bright headlights, these aren't what you want.  If you plan to do an HID retrofit, go with the black housing instead of chrome (and buy a retrofit kit that includes lenses) and they should be fine.
B0000AYZ3O|4|Great Deal!!
B004MDEVBU|4|Great hitch. Instructions were good.  When on fairly easy.  I didn't like that the spare tire now doesn't sit in place straight but it still goes up and down fine.  The shipping package was terrible and the hitch came with a few scrapes but nothing major.
B00LIAOUU2|1|Got in good time but package was beat up and product looked to be used
B000C9Y14A|5|The best oil filter made, just ask your mechanic.
B00E3M82XI|5|Perfect fit!<br />Identical size<br />The Mann filter has slightly longer rubber/plastic piece at the narrow end of the filter, but does not affect usage.<br /><br />Be careful when removing the metal retainer clip so that it doesn't fly off. While the filter comes with the large plastic holder, it does not come with metal clips
B00CSCWOA2|4|ok
B0018YGNTE|5|Gave my truck a better ride
B00B2SD7FY|5|Nice fit and good material at a fair price
B0040D2QC8|1|I ordered this part for the bottom front air deflector replacement on my GMC Canyon pickup at the same time as I bought the deflector because the deflector page indicated they go together. The required clips are similar, but these clips do not fit. The are a couple sizes to large.
B00CZBQCR2|1|Wron actuator.
B0011NDZKW|5|Works for me. I mean how can you screw up on a oil drain plug. Like buying bananas. One brand tastes just like another. I have a '97 Chevy Venture with a 3.4 motor by the way. So to all the owners of this year and model; IT WORKS.  It is a good idea to replace the rubber seal that came with it after about every 10 oil changes. It's up to you. But when you go to change your oil and notice some oil around the plug that is a good indication that the rubber seal needs to be replaced.
B000FRZ9A4|5|great buy !
B000C2UKXS|5|Direct fit for my 1982 Chevy luv diesel c223.
B0041TS29C|2|I purchased this product and was pretty happy when I received it. Looked identical to the one that I was replacing. I ended up getting it color matched and when I had the mirror installed the mirror itself is distorted. It looks like I am seeing double when I look it the mirror and cannot see clearly.
B004M66OZ8|5|This is a good looking key chain for a Toyota Tundra truck owner.  Fits well in a pocket or purse.
B000CN9AK6|3|bushings fine but no washers
B004GCRIYY|5|Easy, no-brainer to install. Saved 100's on replacement at dealer's.
B0006JO0TC|5|I have three of these panels. I use one to keep my ATV battery charged, One to keep my tractor battery charged and one to keep my boat battery charged. They work fine for that purpose.
B00JE5SLGW|4|This is described as a 2 wire meter.  It is a 3 wire meter.  It reads .09 volts high compared to my fluke and there is no trim pot to zero it in.  It is yet to be determined if I can hook both VCC and Sample to +12 and get a steady reading. I did hook both VCC and Sample together and it works fine. For the price, I can interpolate the actual voltages.
B008J25JCA|5|My husband was kind of skeptical about getting such a cheap replacement remote as the Dealership quoted $125.00 for the remote and programming.  The directions for programing the device were so easy and I actually programmed it in under 3 minutes myself.  Works like a charm and so happy I did not get burned by the dealership...Saved $113.00 to DO IT MYSELF.  These really work great!!
B002AMAXNA|5|Haven't had to use this yet (and hope I never have to), but I'm sure it would get the job done. Will probably buy a few more as stocking stuffers for the holidays.
B000MDZLRC|5|This cover fit perfectly on my 31\\" Spare tire...fit is nice and snug and looks great...great item for the price...
B0055DV81C|5|These are far better than I expected and they arrived quickly!  A girl can never have too many bungies laying around the house!
B007HSLSNG|5|High quality
B008B08QKC|5|My 2002 Tahoe with 76,000 miles was mechanically in excellent shape. The paint was dull and the lights duller. Didn't want to get rid of a good vehicle so I did something about the things I disliked about it.<br />Had a local paint shop do $700 paint touch up and detailing. I spent a lot of time researching euro type lights before going with RXmotering's. Installation of the headlights was a tight fit. Did a little cutting on excess plastic on both the Tahoe and back of the light. It's a piece of cake to do in good outside lighting.<br /><br />My friends think I have a new car. Hope this helps...
B000FRTZDG|5|Excellent Seller and Product!!!
B000SP5YUS|4|It is nice small and handy to use.
B000L6203S|2|This product works well but the battery does not hold charge for a long time. I fully charged the unit and placed it in my vehicle until i needed to use it. when i tried to use it about three weeks later the batteruy was depleted. this happened a few times.
B0029XHOK0|3|this is a ok product had problems with the sticker coming off the sheet had to peel some off and put them on
B00CFJT6AE|1|I tried one of these to fix a 2006 vw jetta 2.5 liter. It would not work. It did not seal. I even took it off and tried adding grease and tried using the old spring. I could not get it to seal.<br /><br />If you can get one local it is worth trying to see if it will work on your cover but it's just a gamble. the price is reflective of their quality control and fit. I'm going to have to buy the whole valve cover to fix my problem.
B007W45UTS|5|I am writing this review because there are no reviews. As far as engine noise, it's not much different from factory, except a little deeper. However, my turbo sounds like a mini jet. Excellent turbo whistle and sounds awesome idling. Also, unexpectedly this came with a chrome exhaust tip. Install was strait forward. As far as driving goes, since the engine is finally breathing, taking off and braking is much smoother and she drives like a hot knife through butter; almost like a gas burner. This thing is perfect all the way around. Perfect price point, perfect turbo whine, easy install and sounds good. Can't go wrong with this product!
B0002SRFLC|2|will not fit behind some CV joints, will not work on Subaru
B000XY51I4|5|Seen my best freind had these, found them on Amazon, better price. I did e-mail if it had two. That was on Sat, it came in that day. There is two.
B00ANWV6C6|1|I just purchased these last week and upon opening the packaging could tell that they were very cheap flimsy plastic.  When securing them to the rim I could instantly tell that the fit was extremely loose.  One fell off on my first 1/2 mile drive. Do your self a favor and spend the money for the OEMs.
B009PF8FYY|4|Much less expensive than OEM GM replacements and work well.  Actually have to hold onto the hood to prevent it going up too fast because these are very powerful when new.  Easy replacement.
B000KL0P4A|4|The chassis did work with the 2006 ford focus ... however I needed to clip some parts off the bottom in order to fit it in.  It was not clear how I needed to hook the side panels to the front section and the instructions had no illustrations of the finished product.<br /><br />At more then once I doubted whether this was the proper product for my car; thinking that I may have had a 2006 Ford Focus (xyz) that had some special dash.  I went out and around to check that no, I had exactly what was printed in the manual.<br /><br />I was also expecting that I would fasten the module into the dash via the flathead screws like the factory stereo.  However, it appeared to stay in there via friction.  I was able to find a place to connect the module at one place, but that was all.<br /><br />The ftont part had alightment slightly off and the colors didn't really match with the overall interior that well.<br /><br />However, as a do-it-yourselfer, and seeing as this cost less then a decent lunch at a cafe, I really ought not expect much as beforehand, my aftermarket stereo was just hanging out in the cavity of my double din for a week or so before this arrived.<br /><br />It's sturdy, fits in snugly, and totally does as advertised; although there was a frustrating amount of, what I could best describe as, unusual, modifications to get to this point.
B006MHDYJY|3|I'm giving this 3 stars because of the problem I encountered. The install went without hitch until I attempted to install the left side fasteners. I installed the right side first because it uses the two (2) carriage bolts and it was easier to spin on the nuts to hold the hitch up in place. My 2005 Magnum has never been in an accident so I know that the frame is straight. The left side is attached with one carriage bolt & nut and two (2) bolts. After getting the one nut installed and attempting to install the (2) two bolts it became clear that the oblong holes weren't long enough to allow them to align with the factory threaded frame holes; they were off, by a lot. I removed the hitch, got out my air die grinder and used a 3/8&#34; carbide burr bit. I elongated the holes an 1/8&#34; and that proved to not be enough. I removed the hitch, again, and ground out another 1/8&#34; which did the trick. I don't know what another DIY person would have done if they didn't have the additional tools; it would take a long time to enlarge those slotted holes with a rat tail file. I probably could have beaten it with a hand sledge but it has such a nice finish I didn't want to scratch it all up.   The wire harness install went very smoothly, no complaints. One suggestion though. If you have big hands, as I do, take extra care when removing the plastic wing nut from the back of the tail light housing; the opening is fairly small and hard to get your fingers or hand into. I dropped the first wing nut, never to see it again. The other one I was a bit more careful with and managed not to drop it. I purchased another OEM nut on ebay for $8.
B001413FUQ|5|Bought it for my sister to show off her accomplishment, I actually bought the same one a year earlier for myself to keep on my fridge. Very simple which I like.
B001DMDT7U|5|Sturdy built product. Included all the parts to install per the diagram. I had to purchase 4 longer bolts than what was supplied for the mounting of the base plate. No problem, Home Depot had them in a grade 8 strength.
B004RDNOTA|5|A simple 10-min installation for the pair on my 2004 Sienna LE with a manual rear hatch, requiring only a flat-head screwdriver.  Exact OEM fit and operation.  Great product and price.  Quick delivery from Amazon.  Highly recommended.
B005JU60ZK|5|I have tried many different wiper blades on my Toyota Tundra, and they all left a streak right in the middle of my vision on the driver's side.  I was about to give up searching for blades that wouldn't leave the streak, when I read reviews and tried these blades: they work exactly as advertised!  They exert even pressure over the surface of the windshield, and I no longer have a streak in the middle of my field of view!  I don't know how they work for snow (they've only been used in San Antonio), but they work great for rain.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Evenly wipe the entire surface of the windshield<br />Easy to install<br />Quiet<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive than other blades<br /><br />Overall:<br />I highly recommend this product; it is worth the extra couple dollars.
B0085EZWBU|4|Very handy keeping the dust out of eyes when bicycling in eastern Oregon; or other dusty areas.
B001F15UBM|5|Works good for a replacement when my original on began to leak.<br />Quick shipping
B0038FLJJA|5|They came very well packaged and several days earlier than expected. They were alot cheaper than the ones at your local auto parts store and made just as well if not better. I actually saved $75 by purchasing from Amazon. They look great on my wifes car.
B002J8UPO2|5|I got this sticker to put on my macbook pro and i absolutely love it! i have a pink one on my dodge caliber and they both look amazing. ANYONE could easily put this on themselves:)
B005ESSY8S|4|THEY LOOK GOOD AND FIT WELL.  ONLY ISSUE WAS THE MIRRORS DIDNT COME WITH BOLTS AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO PICK SOME UP FROM THE HARDWARE STORE.  THE MIRRORS I TOOK OFF WERE AFTER MARKET SO I AM NOT SURE IF THE ORIGINAL MIRRORS BOLT WILL WORK FOR THESE.
B0055SYJ8Q|5|Perfect
B00BD9RC8A|2|This is an old style brake handle.  I bought it for my '73.  I am not going to use it.  The finish looks OK, but the &#34;Made in China&#34; sticker that was applied left its mark in the chrome.  I didn't actually install it, but when I fit it together it felt like it would be loose (release button - handle).
B004QEH16M|4|No problems here.  I did cut a splice in the top to release air so it goes on and off easier.  Many people don't, but I grease my balls so there is a seal when putting it off and on.  The slit makes it go on and off easier and I don't have to worry about water because I grease my balls!
B001CUNFGI|4|It is what it is! R 134A refrigerant for about 1/2 the price they charge at the auto stores.
B00D3QQUGG|5|I definitely noticed a difference once we started using these magnets. Drivers were much less likely to tailgate or drive aggressively behind or around us.<br /><br />I know when I see a car with driving school logos or student driver signs, I always give them a wide berth.
B00BES2IZW|5|Cheap, east to install, looks good and works great. What more could you ask for other than the fact it doesn't say HD on it
B005N53AM2|4|When I first received the steering wheel cover it smelled awful. The type of plastic they use has an unpleasant smell. But after about a week it went away. The cover is hard to put on the steering wheel, which is actually a good thing since the tightness keeps it from slipping. I solved the problem by parking my car in the sun with the steering wheel cover partially attached. After it sat in the sun, it was more pliable and easier to get on the steering wheel. It looks lovely in my car, and the cloth stays a neutral temperature. The steering wheel is never too hot to handle nor too cold to grip now. I'm going to order the matching seat covers next!
B00JRTKAZ0|5|They fit like a glove. They are great for all this snowy weather this winter.
B000HZT89C|5|Every car should have one of these.   I use it all the time.   If you don't want trash on the floor of your car then you need this.   I have had one for years and this one I purchased for my daughter's car.   The quality of this litter bag is excellent.
B009YLT3QI|5|OEM all the way!
B00DP3MGME|5|They work great. They work so good that I only have to replace them once or twice a year when they get too hot and burn themselves out.
B0002RNSG4|5|Easy install. It made wiring up my 2006 jeep liberty for towing extremely easy. True plug and play. The only part you actually need a tool for is grounding the wiring harness.
B0030D0T2S|5|Don't know what else to say, but my Cherokee battery seems to suck and I've had to jump it about 4 times in the last week, and these cables have worked well every time. They could be a little tougher, but if I'm not abusing them, I expect them to last several years.
B00B7SLVGG|5|Love them
B00192JGN0|5|Bought these covers for my ST205 75 R14 boat trailer tires in early Oct 2012. Here in south Louisiana the summer sun is brutal and I just bought these tires a couple months ago. Covers have a durable vinyl with a convenient adjustable snap in the back to snug them up. They've been installed for over two weeks and appear to be doing fine. One thing to watch is damage from a grass trimmer since the covers extend down past the tires about two inches. Definately would buy again.
B0031T3SUG|5|This Warmskin Balaclava is great for the winter months if you live in a northern state. It fits well on my head (not too loose, not too tight) and the mesh breather keeps your nose and mouth area warm without making you feel suffocated. Highly recommended.
B0008FUH46|4|Feels like it's well made I just wish it had a cover over the key lock to protect it from the weather.
B000EDOSM4|1|I have a SURVEYOR SP280BH, 30.7\\" Travel Trailer.  I have brown plastic bath and kitchen faucets and the thread on these will not fit this hose adapter. They will fit the ones in your house but apparently the ones on my RV are different.
B00EZADNVE|5|Price of headline was low than anyone that I buy parts. Fit perfect.
B0041PWFP8|5|Heavy duty. Works well
B00CNUFEBK|5|its doing what it has to do, there is a window on upper side for display logo, then it may use for  same shape keys of other brands.
B003FO2O1G|5|Works great on our motorhome antenna.  Pick up more channels.
B0041CAECM|5|These pipes make awesome low end power.  I ride 2 up all the time and these pipes really gave the bike a lot more power for lugging around 2 people.  I had true duals on before and loved the sound but not the performance.  The sound is good, but not as loud at the true duals!  Love the quality of the product.  They fit perfect and the chrome is awesome!  No problems here!  I think S&S has these pipes figured out!
B00GZ05BCG|5|Fits good and easy install.
B00B3YRR0I|5|Works great with my 2011 Cadilac EXT
B000E2AQXA|5|The filter gooded great and came very quickly
B00466V9AY|5|This opener works great.  We have had No problems.  I would order this car door opener again with no reservations.
B004RPJWHQ|5|Great paw print valve stem caps - they look great on our cars! Would recommend this product to others. Fast shipping!
B00DSMEL2A|4|Cleans good but it doesn't cleans as well as it did years ago
B000HBNV6W|4|Used a couple of times replacing ceramic pads with good results.
B000LG6IBI|5|Great price and fast delivery on my keyless entry. Programming was very easy to understand. Had it programmed and on my keychain within 5 minutes. Didn't even need to bug my husband to figure it out for me!
B00FH43VFK|5|Can't beat the helmet for the price.  Very comfortable and at high speeds visor seals well lowering the sound and wind inside helmet.
B000GPRG9M|5|Super deal on the price of this sport grip steering wheel cover.  It is REALLY difficult to get on (I am a 57 year old female that doesn't work out much, so maybe it is easier for a stronger person to get it on), but once you get it on, it is REALLY nice and comfortable and improves the look of my car.  The color is a soft dark tan that goes perfectly in my car even though it is a few shades darker than my leather upholstery.  I was happily surprised that it is so well made and attractive looking for the low price of the product.  It was exactly what I wanted, looks just like the photo on site, but was so much better made than I expected for the price.  Love it, great deal..!!
B00FO5YP1Q|1|This is not a &#34;No Cut&#34; design as advertised for '06 suzuki hayabusa.  I'm disappointed.  The Fairing must be cut and modified.  I had to purchase the correct item from another vendor.  Wasted my money due to false advertisement.
B000C59N42|2|I wish someone would have given some warning on the item before I bought it.  This is just for the strut.  I did not receive the boot or spring bumper for the item.  So if you think what you get will look like the picture, you will be sorely disappointed.  You get an unmarked, black strut loose in a box with a little nut in a baggie.  That's it.  I bought all four and, though the boxes were a little different, they were all the same in quality.
B006JN5ED0|5|This thing is awesome!  It accordians out of the way when not in use.  Everyone always asks where I got it!
B000IYNA2I|5|Well I failed the smog test here in Ca and labled a gross poluter. And my 1995 S10 was going through gas like it was water. And I was only getting 200 miles to a tank of gas. So I read that the vapor and map sensor if they go bad could cause you to go through a tank of gas like nothing. I thought this was going to be a pain in the butt to remove and replace this but it took my longer to get the tools and getting under the truck then to replace it. 10 mins to remove and replace. I still did not pass the smog test when I had it retested. but my gas milage did go back up to normal. I still had to replace the Cat and oxygen sensor to pass the smog test here in California.
B00IUXQM38|5|Looks great and works great.
B004ZF3DYG|3|I bought this set to replace the factory halogens in my F150. Installation went pretty well but had a problem with only one bulb igniting when using auto lamps. Had something to do with low voltage during engine start. Fixed it by installing a 10 delay at engine start. Anyway, after about a year, started having flickering issues while driving. Like they were bouncing from low beam to high beam on their own. I started to not trust them. Headlights have to work. Every time. So, I just put a new set of halogens back in. While doing that, I noticed some damage inside my head light assembly. I think the HIDs were overheating the enclosure. I'll try to attach a pic. Customer service is great! But, OEM bulbs are OEM for a reason, you can rely on them.
B000BYB2K2|5|Wish I would have known about these wipers in years past. My latest wipers didn't take more than a year or so to start degrading and I was sick of buying local auto store cheapies that I can look forward to replacing next year and also blades that are a pain to deal with in this wet/icy new england winter climate. I read up on the reviews here on amazon and am happy I took everyone's advice. To early to tell but I bet these hold up great through winter and provide more life than my previous sets of wipers.
B0037NIG44|1|Can not recommend this product. Installed easily, but in less than 2 moths time, The check engine light came on. You guessed it, it threw a code for a bad synchro. Emailed Amazon to see if they will honor the manufacturers 90 day warranty.
B000BZADQK|5|These bearings have worked well; have had them in for about 2000 miles. Ordered this model for '02 Ford F250 7.3L. Fits and works perfect.
B000VUASMY|4|it does job but it flew from wind hit my back window no damage spray in liner is best way to go it does fit good
B003888CPG|4|Fits as described.
B00V3JJXKA|5|Great deal
B00BSTWYCE|5|Fits and works good.
B00697RY6G|4|You should consider adding more pic's of the moldings on the vehicle.  I thought I was purchasing the moldings Acura provides but was surprised these moldings sit higher on the MDX and do not look the same as the factory ones.  I still like them but more pictures can prevent this type of confusion/mistake.  Plus the moldings you have in the current picture aren't even the ones you provide.
B000071NUM|5|Very nice product, works as expected,
B004L5KK0A|5|WOW my daughter couldnt be any happier, she loves it!!!  her friends love it and they are amazed how great they look on her car.  After that you are hooked and you get other similar colors on stuff like cup holders, cd holders etc, the fabric is good not like the other ones that yes you pay cheap but dont look as good.
B006V4S0VK|5|It's proudly displayed on my truck!!
B001HBWKC2|2|Do not fit my key size. I waste my money!!!!!!!! Feel sad.  I have BMW X6.<br />And I just bought my car.
B000BQ08QO|5|SEARCHED ALL OVER FOR A 20MM TO 20MM FILTER RELOCATION.THIS KIT SEEMED TO GOOD TO BE TRUE BUT I FIGURED ID CHANCE THE 24.00. WELL I'M GLAD I DID! IT WORKED PERFECTLY WITH LOTS OF OPTIONS. I WISH I COULD GIVE IT 10 STARS!
B002P8USYS|1|I ordered this because my original broke off. First of all these are not even close to the factory mirrors. The lever to adjust is completely different. And the one I was sent was constructed poorly. The mirror will not adjust high enough and the lever hits the A-pillar making it not view high enough for me.  I don't know if they are all like this or I got the messed up one. But you are taking a gamble with the replacements.
B005DUV9OI|4|Came on time :). The LEDs that come aren't the same ones as shown in the picture. Worked well tho. I am pleased with this purchase.
B00A8MM0G2|5|works!
B00546KUDM|5|Good hooks for the money. I have winched a number of cars on to my trailer with them. Also great for general scrap iron like pieces of old farm machinery the large hook comes in handy.
B001EP2904|2|Attn: Curt- This needs to be longer so a receiver pin can hold it in place.  Otherwise it falls out in the car wash and possibly after many miles of road vibration.
B00ITXKNDO|5|Went in to a 1983 Honda 185s perfectly.
B004AE0EBC|5|Great product, just as expected with quick arrival.<br />Service was wonderful!!!
B0053ZNMDE|5|This stuff is great!  it's so much easier to apply as a stick than a liquid/gel.  Less mess and more control with dispensing.  I will buy every STICK Loctite sells as the needs arise.
B0013V6NBA|5|EXCELENTE...
B004HMBK5G|1|Only worked one time. Once you remove seatbelt, it won't work again.
B001LA4IXS|4|Had a little trouble getting it to come off but over all it ended up working just fine, hopefully it holds up.
B003YLKLD8|5|Work fine, fix my heating problem
B004HCM9H4|5|I put two coats of this wax on my newly polished 14 year old motorcycle's paint.  It now shines like a mirror.
B0010DMXYM|4|Easy to install, Looks great. If you use a ratcheting wrench for these they are much easier to install.
B00BUGQZPW|5|Exactly as advertised
B007BXCMI2|5|So far, so good. Build quality looks good, and fit was perfect. Some filters are too tall, and get crushed upon install. Gaskets seem to be of good quality as well. It's hard to go wrong with a Purolator Synthetic filter.
B0041TQSRA|5|Exact replacement for an orginal OEM cabin filter for a 2009 Hydai Sonata. Much cheaper than any of the after market versions.
B00EECLXLK|5|A great company to work with! The product is fantastic, I replaced the factory hid bulbs on my 740i BMW with 10,000w bulbs, twice as bright and at such a great price.
B006U58KXI|5|My husband and I made use of all five of these mustache decals within the first 10 minutes of opening them. They are the really good kind of decals that peel from both sides so no clear plastic shows around them. We've stuck them on a variety of things, from laptops to kayaks. Even with the H2O exposure in the kayaks, they've held strong!
B0000AYES4|5|Very nice kit for easy change out of ball sizes. When you have numerous trailers this makes it easy tow different things without a fuss.
B0042ZPA9U|5|Love it - great for outdoor decks - doesn't seem to mildew or retain water like those &#34;outdoor&#34; carpets always do.
B0061R34M2|2|One of the lights came with a problem with the hardware, lazy to return I fixed it with some imagination. A month ago, one of the bulbs blown. VERY POOR QUALITY. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE
B00HMG8QHE|4|Great product and amazing customer service
B003WSZH9G|5|Worth every penny! Bought this for my lowered Jag on 20's to do DIY car work. Very helpful for OIl Changes and what not. Build quality is top notch, I would definitely buy again, but then again, these look like they will last for years to come. Very good clearance height while underneath.
B00KTHYCEO|5|Easy to program. It works great.
B00BKVFJTK|1|Hell to get on and it's not differential size to account for throttle assembly on the right side....thrown away already
B002R1PWWQ|4|Just installed yesterday.  Had heavy rain fall and notice a little leakage into seal, hope it stops there.  Other than that and the (1) day of usage, everything seems to be working fine.  I will follow up after more time has passed.  Shipping was fast and packaging was fine.  Thanks.
B009FIC2N6|5|Was a really well worth product ; went well with the matching Jamaican Flag License  Plate.
B00FT2TET2|5|I have a special edition 2014 Kawasaki kfx450r quad, didnt know what i wanted but after researching alot.... i bought this full system locally and efi for 801.00<br /><br />U will love it adds low and mid range without the efi... with proper tunin and i run 110 octane its amazing. Sounds beast looks amazing lighten my bike up so so much im so happy im doing a review, trust me just buy it try it n u will love it
B00829RHE8|1|junk
B0028UK7JE|5|This is a nice quality extension cord. I really only use it when my RV is at the house, but have no doubts about performance.
B0000DYV3N|1|not satisfied sent it back
B008WWH9UM|5|Very well made! perfect fit, just make sure your car is a 97-01 2.5rs bumper style Only, this will not fit on a regular 97-01 square fog light bumper. I will buy a couple of this in the future for others impreza projects. Thanks!
B001F7CFPU|5|It may be my imagination, but my car seems to run a little better since I replaced my O2 sensors at 170,000 miles.<br /><br />Denso (a Japanese company) is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), so they are a perfect fit replacement for the old ones on my 2007 Subaru Impreza 2.5i. These are packaged with some extra hi-temperature anti-sieze compound, so they won't become permanently stuck in your exhaust system.<br /><br />All you really need to do the job is a 22mm open end wrench and a diagonal cutter (side cutter). I have a socket specifically made for O2 sensors, but it was easier just to use the open end wrench due to vertical space limitations. The diagonal cutter is used to cut and remove the old clip that holds the wire in place at its mid-point.<br /><br />Assembled in the USA
B003YMX288|5|This was exactly the part I needed. The shipping was fast aND the part worked great for me.
B002M1SQ24|5|Crush washers work great on 14mm plug for Nissan Altima 2012 & 2014.<br />The box has 10.
B004Q3KE12|5|The quality was what I expected. It was a gift for my daughter who love butterflies. Look great in her car
B004K2FSXI|5|Very good!
B00BJ7OK6I|5|I thought it was metal.  But it worked and looks good.
B009DJX4O8|5|Perfect fit. Works perfect.
B00CEXK6R8|3|I do not like how it mounts on the ends.
B00E1SMY5Q|5|a second purchase of these because of good experience with a 4-wheel set for my older Jeep.
B004C444VG|5|good fit, very flexible, not real warm, more of a Spring and Fall glove, will probably buy a second pair, reasonably priced compared to motorcycle shops
B000KV8KJ2|5|Could not be happier.  Although it did say in the description (at least that we read) it also has the fittings for the tie downs built into the unit.
B000HVTERW|3|This carrier is s bit awkward to use and has sharp edges that can cut the hands.
B001VHRX6A|5|Awesome I love it works great thank you
B0047RV8WG|5|It is easy to install but beware of polarity, if it doesn't work, reverse the terminals and here it goes. Bright enough as expected and more energy saving. Hope it will last longer than the conventional bulb.
B0009RSR36|2|These are great for warning of low pressure, but mine got frozen onto the valve stems after about 2 years.  Required vice grips and damage to valve stem to remove them.  If you use them, put some grease (maybe plumber's grease?) on them before attaching.
B003XGYDE2|5|This thing is awesome for everyday use!
B000H8XIP4|4|The package arrived without damage, the item is new and in perfect condition. The only thing the page does not mention is that this fog lamp is for SEDAN MODELS ONLY. I have a Saturn Ion COUPE and this is not the correct item.
B001A1RLC8|3|[[VIDEOID:38824041]]October 20, 2009    The product was received today.  The gloves have come to unravel the fabric on the fingers and left hand was torn. This is unacceptable for a product purchased as new.  I do not recommend the product or the supplier.  I want to be refound ou receive another good condition gloves.    ................................    December 2, 2009    The seller sent me another new gloves to replace the defective ones that was showed in this video.  The new gloves are ok and are a good choice.    ...............................
B000EANNDM|5|OIL EATER: I have used it for years.  It is advertised as a oil detergent but it is excellent for heavy cleaning.  I have rentals and a five gallon pail of this will clean a unit in and out after a Sec 8 tenancy just fine.  If you use full strength you need gloves.
B0067ED4ME|5|just the right part for my Suzuki GN 125
B001GORX3Q|4|This item was easy to install and took less time than in the instructions included in the writeup for the item.  Although it's only been a couple of weeks, I don't have any complaints about this item.
B003NDPUP6|4|very good
B002UC2ZCM|5|Worked exactly as advertised. Very simple installation. Took a matter of seconds to swap out !
B000GUPN9M|5|Fit great and was fun to install. Adds such a gorgeous touch of beauty. So much lighter and sounds sexy. Using this with a Power Commander V, O2 sensor and K&N filter.
B0021URQSQ|5|It worked out great, it was large enough to cover the area in which welding was going on?
B008S9CPFS|4|I bought this helmet due to California's rediculous side by side helmet law.  The helmet is small for the price.  Seems well made.  I have owned it for almost a year and no problems. I am buying a second one for my passenger.
B004I12W6M|5|Excellent replacement.
B001E74NE2|5|I had no problms installing the hub caps.  I have had them on my Nissan Cube for a few weeks now and have hit a lot of Ohio pot holes and they stayed on.  For the price they look great.
B008BE04C6|5|Used these in my HHR. Awsome light.Very nice field of light.
B0013ERRSK|5|Absolutely perfect!!!
B00BTKWQ3O|1|Lasted only about three months and began to fail.  These made in China bulbs are worthless.
B000LUBQ52|1|read alot about this battery,good things,amazon price great.so I ordered it sept 17/2010,recd sept29th,not bad its heavy,installed it and worked great till !yr and 3months its dead.Amazon only warrenties it 365 days,Kinetik only warrenties it for 1yr[I know its thw same amount of time thats how they state it]so a battery thats $224 dollars is only good for a year,but a battery at wallymart for $59 is good for 3 years and $20 more is a 5 year battery,at least sears is prorated,Optima batteries at costco and sam,s club has a 3 year and its $100 cheaper.what a rip off,just like laser discs.
B002QALLOQ|5|Wanted to run electric into a small camp trailer - nothing too fancy, just 2 outlets.  Since what I planned to hook up didn't need a big 30 amp supply, this fit the bill.<br /><br />And, since it uses a regular extension cord, if forgot the cord I could pick one up just about anywhere.<br /><br />Easy to install, but you have to cut the hole just right.  Too large and the screw that hold it in place won't have anywhere to bite.
B009E9JIRE|2|The only thing that is positive it that it locks and unlocks my car. The remote start feature doesn't work because the programming is not set up correctly within the fob. The remote start button makes the alarm sound. I had to take fob back to dealership to determine reason for this issue. I will never buy another electronic device from an online service. I will pay the additional cost to get genuine parts. Lesson learned. Frustrated in Arizona.
B0057B4XS2|5|Fits like the oem one! Looks original and works jus fine
B007JBC2JA|5|This showed up a day early and it fit perfectly. The best part is that now my trunk actually works!!! I found the same part at an auto parts store for $75, so I looked on Amazon and found this one. Incase you want to know I have a 2001 VW Jetta.
B009WEUZ3C|5|Love it!  Awesome look!  Exactly the look I wanted and matches the theme of my bike perfectly.  Easy to put on.  Arrived Quickly.  Really appreciate it!  Thanks!!
B001AWIHHK|5|Easy to use and read. Very accurate.
B005MJYTYC|4|The brace worked well. I can feel the support and the x strap help add extra support. But I like the model they had a couple of years ago.. it was made with a thicker neoprene material and it felt like it provided alot more support. But overall this model did well
B00L2QM806|5|With 2 young kids in the back seat having shade is a must. This sun shade by x- shade is the best I have bought. It provides excellent sun protection yet they able to look out the window and enjoy the scenery. Installing them was super easy and they are the perfect size for the perfect amount of shade.
B004A30XJ6|5|went on very easy.
B001O4DLIE|5|This bumpersticker was exactly what I expected.  I have it on my car (natch).  Isn't it ironic that most wars were started in the name of \\"religion\\"?  Be proud to remind others that it's NOT about GOD blessing America or Christians or anyone, but about EVERYONE (or no one) being blessed.  Imagine...everyone getting along.  Thanks, John!
B00H8SQVYQ|5|Excellent
B0013ET0IU|3|i agree 100% with George P. Olsey Jr. comments. 2006 dodge 5.9 mega cab khaki dash color. edge cts
B000BXOGNI|5|I bought this product to clean my the clock mechanism on clock left to me by my grandfather.  This clock is over 100 years old and moisture and dirt had taken its toll.  The spray did a nice job removing the grime that built up without hurting the workings or the clock face or the wood.  So Grampa's clock continues to run and keep perfect time.
B000CPCBEQ|5|My old miata called for GL4, & go figure, my old Geo Tracker did the same.  Try & find GL4 & it's a nightmare.  I heard Napa has GL4 but everytime I got they don't so I just stocked up here.  Miata is gone but still have the tracker as my toy, so about once a year I do a change out...<br /><br />thanx<br />David
B00MN92QI0|2|Lights work great and easy installation but black controller box got hot within a couple hours of use and quit working also the white connecters for the wires were cheap and came undone. Only about 6 ft of wire for each light.
B00B7SZPZE|2|Nothing special. Ok at night, during daylight is hard to see the difference between running lights and turn signals..
B00BP9LFAO|4|Great Mats but the Stiching has started to come undone on the Drivers side. I had even put clear plastic mats over them When I first bought them. I guess its just wear and tear. I would buy them again and might look for something to make sure the stiching won't come undone.
B004N1T6XY|5|I love it, wife hates it.
B000CIT1Y6|1|This item is large and heavy, but was put in a flimsy/thin cardboard carton with no support or packing. Whoever is in charge of that department either does not care or is just plain incompetent. The chest came all banged up and not usable. In fact, because of the extensive damage, I decided not to reorder the chest as I felt it also was not built sturdy enough for its intended use.
B00JQRQHIM|5|These gave my 2007 Tundra a new look and freshened the tired look of the original discolored headlights.  They were very easy to install, just use a search engine to watch one of the various how to videos.
B00W2XFUN0|4|These are better than the ones that were on my Envoy when I got it!  Everyone should get some!
B00122EGOQ|5|Well worth the cost, added HP plus performance, ease of installation,<br />A real no brainer.
B00NGFACCW|5|Perfect fit
B00C6MYUDS|5|Quality and fit is spot on, quite satisfied with product
B00192JH5W|5|Bought this as used from Amazon Wharehouse deals. It was brand new just the box was ripped open. If you see one used and it's from Amazon Wharehouse buy it. I tow a 23' travel trailer with a '08 Chevy Avalance LT. I will never tow without this hitch. This same hitch at the RV dealer was $599.00. All set with that!!
B00DR14W4Y|5|Awesome top. Awesome fit!
B005VFWOOE|4|do you think that people will question me when i drive up to the elementary school to work and this is on my window???
B000X2B0RW|4|I have several lead-acid batteries that I need to keep charged up; I heard about desulphating chargers, then found this one. I first used it on a 5-year-old car battery whose voltage indicated that it was at about 40% capacity.  After following the directions (about 6 days of desulphating), the voltage jumped up to a point that indicated that the battery was now at 90%.<br /><br />I have a friend who had been trickle charging his older car battery and felt that he had gotten it as fully charged as he could, but then I loaned him this charger and a week later got a phone message from him indicating surprise at how much his battery had improved. He was convinced! It's very possible to double a battery's life with this charger, and so it can pay for itself quickly.<br /><br />The problems with this charger are the complexity and the poor documentation.  I think you can see the all the lights and buttons on the front of it - somewhat bewildering to most.  So you have to spend a lot of time reading the manual at first, and, I think, it could take a lot less time if they could find a competent technical writer. They KNOW their manual has problems because they added a supplement that says to ignore all the instructions in the manual and just read that one page supplement! The trouble is, even that supplement is a bit hard to understand.  One example is how batteries are to treated as large, medium, or small, but they really don't tell you how to classify them. I had assumed a battery for a compact car would be considered medium, but a phone call to their support guy informed me that it was actually large.  The manual just assumes that we can read their minds on things like this, but we can't, so we get confused and use the charger improperly.
B001QN7F62|1|Really the palm tree was fine.. It just didn't fit correctly on my wall - SO. I wanted to return it.  I got absolutely no response.  I emailed them several times and never got a response.  Not good business.  So therefore I would not order from them again.
B000BITYS0|5|The helmet has a good look and the safeness of the helmet being dot certified is even better. Thank you.
B009E9J1Y4|5|I received the remote sooner than expected and it functions as designed. The horn button seems a bit more exposed in the aftermarket case. I set the horn off numerous times with the remote in my pocket, so I placed the circuit board in the original factory casing.<br /><br />As soon as my budget permits I'll order another.
B001C92YP2|5|This rotor was confirmed by me through an EBC rep to fit a Chrysler 200 rear rotor with 18 inch wheels.  My car is the 3.6 liter v6 289 horse power.  The Amazon &#34;car tool&#34;  for finding parts has the incorrect parts for the rear axle and I don't know if it's been fixed yet.  The pads for the rear axle were also incorrect.  The car stops great now and I would recommend these and  I believe my ride is smoother.
B0000AZ8JB|3|I've been using  this in place or the OEM rear view mirror in my van.  It stays up pretty good and when it does happen to fall is easy to suction back up.  You can see much more area with this than with the original mirror, but the objects being closer than they appear isn't great.
B000GZAVZS|5|I bought these to convert my 79' Triumph Spitfire Bonnett (hood).  Installation was a breeze and they work awesome!  Would recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing.
B008C45XDK|5|Super bright like the ad said . More than pleased. I would recommend this to anyone who needs more light to their ride
B0009NZL1Q|4|This is a good product, extremely sturdy, a very thick and durrable material. It made it just fine through rain, snow, hail, wind and shine from Utah through the Alaska/Canada highway and then all the way through Alaska to Kodiak. No leaks, no accidents, no rips and still looks brand new. The only problem i have with this product was that it only loads from the back, so it is extremely difficul to load (seriously, i read the reviews and shrugged that advice off, and was surprised just how hard it was) i was also always worried that the method of closing the bag, which is just rolling it up like a potato chip bag, would not hold well, but it really was solid, and there are loops on the ends so that when you roll it up you can bring the ends together and secure them with a lock or just a rope like we did.<br /><br />Regaurding NOT HAVING A ROOF RACK on our midsized sedan- it actually worked decently without a roof rack, and we just straped some sinch straps through the car doors. my word of EXTREEME caution on this is that because we were using the bag to move our entire household (heavy items) combined with the difficulty of loading the bag (i had to climb around on the roof of my car) the roof of our car was/ is perminently damaged, there are large dents and bumps all over the roof of our car, caused mostly by my wight climbing on the roof to load (i think), but many still left just from the items weight alone. This would not, i feel, be an issue if the items you were loading didnt weigh much, and/or they were soft or rounded (ours were all moving boxes), but if you have heavy items, my advice would be to figure something else out, because the roof repairs will probably cost more than the shipping would have.<br />The thing seriously takes a huge load though and we were able to fit 6 medium sized moving boxes, a couple back packs, and a jumbo sized flat bag style \\"space bag\\" with no problems, and it distrubuted the weight well so that we didnt have to have all of the weight in our trunk.<br />I would reccomend buying a skid proof matt that will show in the \\"also bought\\" section if you are using it withough a rack, i think we would have probably lost the bag had we not had one.e weight in our trunk.<br />I would reccomend buying a skid proof matt that will show in the \\"also bought\\" section if you are using it withough a rack, i think we would have probably lost the bag had we not had one.
B004IG79WE|5|I have tried about 4 different towels (even the high rated ones on amazon), and none of them are as good as these.<br />I accidentally got one of these at a vending machine at a local car wash. I didn't think much of them because they were only $2, but they turn out to be really good. The one defining feature about them is that they do not leave streaks on glass surfaces. All the other towels I've tried leave streaks. These do not.
B003OBRSRA|5|Works like a charm, easy to install. No idea what long term performance will be, but so far so good.
B000CIV1N0|5|It's a pulley. It works, so far.
B0035P7KCI|3|Not helpful for my dents, possibly for someone else's.
B00CYU9DF2|4|Didn't camber as much as I wanted, but built very well.
B000COCAC0|5|My truck is a 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4 Quad Cab  I've always known Bushwacker puts out quality products, but these flares are more than I expected. I've purchased more than my share of Off Road parts before and they all have the same things in common: Either you need specialty tools or there is always something that is not included which you have to buy separately. Lets not forget the instructions that never make sense.Well, here is the complete review of these flares:  1.Packaged securely from factory. 2.All the pieces were included. 3. The instructions were easy to understand and included step by step pictures. 4. PERFECT FIT!! NO CUTTING OR TRIMMING REQUIRED!!  It took about 20 minutes per flare to mount the gasket and the bolts to the flares. The actual installation time was: (ONE PERSON ONLY, Using no special tools, no hoist, no drill, and leaving the tires on)**9 minutes** for each of the front flares and **22 minutes** for each of the rear flares. Actually the second front one only took **7 minutes**.  They claim that they will allow you to use 35\\" tires with no stick out, my 37\\" x 12\\" Hummer tires are nicely hidden and are perfectly street legal now.  Thanks Bushwacker for all your attention when manufacturing these flare kits.
B006K8VNH0|5|basically took it apart and installed switches for rigid industries light bar and dually. then installed a corvette c5 start button.
B00APJVAMS|5|Very noticeable improvement in cold starting and driving performance from the installation of these high quality OEM injector seals for my 2004 6.0l Power Stroke diesel.<br /><br />Press copper seal on the suitable size deep-well socket for simple trouble free seating. You will need smallest flathead screw driver and working against workbench surface to pry the old copper seals off...once you figure out the first one the rest will go easy.
B000CITK8S|5|Winters are long where I live so bikes dont run for months. the tender really keeps the battery full and ready.
B0002KNYK6|5|Haven't used it yet but it seems to be well made and I like the size.
B00KTJ0KA2|5|Very low price and easy programming instrutions to program both the key and the remote on your own!  I took the key to Walmart and they cut it for free!! I am very pleased with the outcome of this purchase, and I saved a fortune!!
B007TO3Z02|2|Expect a DARK GREY non Translucent  paint which does not have a smooth finish.  The Only good thing is that it can be easily removed.
B000C540DQ|5|correct product, great price.
B00068XCQU|5|Bought a new one for me and gave my older unit o my son who is moving out. A very good chargerv
B00U2ADLW2|5|This second one works super and has earned the 5 Star's in spite of the first one I purchased which &#34;failed to connect&#34; to my trucks computer.  I had to return it but the replacement has worked out perfect for me.  Thank You &#34;Blusmart&#34; and Thank You Amazon for terrific service and standing behind the items you offer..  I'd recommend this tool to anyone without question..
B004OK86XA|3|If you need just the inner workings of a coupler, this is for you.  It includes the lever and clamping mechanism that secures the ball to the coupler.  Unfortunately, that’s not what how this item was pictured or described.  Guess I should have read the reviews instead of the product description.
B002XYJJTY|5|Exactly the right piece, came complete and ready to install (you do need a rivet gun).  Fit was right on and works perfectly
B0026JAK9Y|5|As discribed
B003ZWED1M|5|Great Value - Better than the OEM !!
B00SKVBDKC|5|Just what I was looking for.
B000BQW5LK|5|I used this to replace the transmission fluid on my truck.  Even though it had the wrong sized lid to screw into the bottles of trans fluid, it still lifted the fluid nicely.  I'll buy this again next time I do a fluid swap.
B000E2ANIS|5|Works great, I could tell a difference between the stock filter and this one. The box says 5 to 8 hp gains but if you pair it with an exhaust and a tuner you will maximize the benefits of both.<br /><br />Other stores charge 10-25 bucks more for this so it's a bargain on here.<br /><br />Includes K&N's Million Mile Warranty, you will never need to buy another air filter again. Requires cleaning once every 25,000 miles but that's only a 2-3 times in the life of a motorcycle.
B00846HT38|5|Nice design.  More sensible use. Prevents temptation of vandalism to the antenna. Easier to store and fits under car cover ;)
B001OBO4FQ|5|I bought this for my 03 gsxr 750. Fit perfect. Looks great
B00HQRUOQA|5|Impressed!! They look exactly like the GM ones but a fraction of price. I never get overly excited about things like this but this was the perfect accessory! Has been through the wash 20-30 times already!!! Everything is packed really well too!
B002MUY3KO|5|I have two of these and they do a great job of watching both the car and my motorcycle.The hardest thing on a battery is not being charged fully I've had them for four months and highly recommend..
B000J2NZ74|5|Can't beat the price.  a couple of duds but other than that, works well on the lamps that line our staircase outside.
B00IKJCN30|5|awesome, installed easily way cheaper than local auto parts
B001JBAUHM|5|It is easy to install. You definitely need this additional  part to enjoy the convertible. love it and recommend it
B00BGS3JMQ|5|Color was right on!
B000H774BY|5|This battery charger works great!  Had opportunity to use it before wrapping -really come in handy
B0027Y1ZHE|4|Lower price for  quality brand  than local parts stores. The parts arrived quickly. I was able to complete my repair under budget.
B00B99U074|1|west of money
B00B2E6LE2|5|This is my first sheepskin steering wheel cover. It still makes me smile when I climb in the truck. Love it. I'll be putting it on every winter.
B0046NUOC6|5|Fast shipping, fits good and works great!
B004HD0CTU|4|I have a popup camper with a Marinco power inlet. I purchased this Conntek power cord because is was about half the price of thr Marinco cord. The coord is as advertised. It is very heavy duty...almost too heavy. Regardless, it is very flexible in spite of its thickness. The angled female connector is nice and keeps from straining the male contacts on my camper. It mates to the Marinco inlet just fine however the black locking ring is slightly larger than the mating Marinco external threads. The threads will not &#34;mesh&#34; since the cord ring is larger. Although this is a great power cord, I am giving it 4 stars since Amazon does not provide any information on the locking ring compatability. I see that Amazon has doubled the price of this item since I purchased it two months ago!
B000C2ADRG|5|Good price
B00110UTLI|5|This is a great wheel cover for the price. it does shed some, but is overall very comfy feeling and stays in place
B003SY3NWM|5|So very pleased with my new lights. looks wonderful. easy to install. I have recommended this to anyone needing a replacement lamp.
B001AMCC80|5|Great for his truck, good quality, fast shipping, no problems afterwards.  Will order again if need these parts as we have many trucks in this household.
B000CIV4LE|3|This is just a badly engineered hose in general. While the Dorman product is probably the best OEM replacement you'll find, it is doomed to fail in a couple months at most. I kept buying these hoses and replacing them, but no more. Go with one of the bypass operations you can find online.
B00G620ZVU|5|These were originally purchased to go along with a pair of 60 degree floods mounted on my off road vehicle. These give the reach that the others lacked. I can not over state how bright these lights are! The light is a very white light with the added benefit that it makes any road sign or road edge marking almost jump out at you. Off road they are like daylight.<br /> Highly recommended and well worth the price.
B0051UGTYK|5|Bought it for my 2007 Ford Escape and it fits perfectly (You have to warm it up to make it easier to fit) The lips on the sides and back do a good job at protecting the back seat and the sides. So easy to just wipe it with a wet cloth! Used to have the cargo full of dog hair not anymore!
B00KQSW78E|5|Works great and looks alot better
B009DK3RFS|5|i love it
B000QN494Y|5|I have a 05 Durango and these were night and day from the stockers, a much better ride! Quality material and rides like a dream.
B008AI6U4O|5|I have been using a cushion like this that belonged to my Mother.  She used it in her car for many years and it was still in good condition but starting to flatten out somewhat.  I searched for one like it everywhere I went, finally saw it in the catalogue and ordered and got it in good time.  Probably my favorite part is that it is made in the USA.
B0002SRF6C|5|This piece was made of good quality, well made and forged nicely. I would recommend this tool.
B003BGSJGC|5|Great Product works 100% and fast shipping to boot!
B00CB8WM2S|5|My granddaughter lives on a river in north Idaho & has to drive by Pend Orielle Lake to get to work. AND she will be heading to college in Sept near the pacific coast. So this was a no brainer. Teens (and others) sometimes think they are invincible. That accidents will never happen to them. But we know different. So I think she needs all the help she can get. Since ordering it for her, I have had comments & endorsements from lots of folks out there. EVERY car in America should come with one of these gadgets factory installed. If you never have to use it; GREAT! But if you do & it isn't there, it could be tragic.
B001G64882|5|Strut is strong easy install. Was literally a 2 min install (would have been 30 second install but I had to find a flat head)<br />If I need to buy another I will use this one again in a heart beat.<br /><br />Hood strut arrived fast thanks to amazon prime. Matched perfect. I did no research on this product only used the \\"amazon garage\\" selected my car and boom perfect match.
B009DJIQZK|3|I order this part thinking it was the fuel pump and sending unit. Turns out this is the sending unit only. I informed the seller of this situation and they resolve the issue very promptly. I would recommend this seller and also use them in the future.
B00B5GZYJA|5|Awesome transaction Super Fast S&H  had it with in 3 days of buying this so my bike riding was restored fast. Battery comes a;ready charged and ready to install which made this a easy job. I will return when I need another one . Do not be affraid to deal with these people . Excellent - Smooth transaction, Priced to save you money also .I saved 27.00  Thank You !
B008N20YGC|5|A nice decal with good detail and heavy material.  Prompt delivery.  Great Seller A++++
B004BCDO0G|4|Fit exactly into my 2001 Ranger Edge.  Definitely not as heavy duty as the OM and I had to set the the setting screw all the way to the top for the beam to be set correctly.  Time will tell if this was a good purchase but the local shop wanted $120 to restore the OM and these only cost $29 for the pair.
B00FTAZ51K|5|These fit my 2005 Yukon XL.  Removing the old lift supports was easy, just use a small screwdriver to lift up the clip on the back at each end.  They pull right off.  Installing the new ones was even easier, just line up the socket with the ball/studs on the vehicle and push in.  No tools for installation, only for removing the old ones.    Make sure to have a second person available to hold the glass up.    Delivery on these was very fast.  They were delivered two days before the start of the expected delivery dates.
B005SUXT6E|5|They are pretty large and come with all hardware necessary.
B0006JLVC6|5|works great.
B001EOV45G|5|Bought for my Curt Hitch after I lost the last one when hitch scraped going over large speed bump.  Works great and stays in place. Holding up well to the elements and sun.
B000GROZK8|5|Just what I wanted.  It looks great with my vehicle and it really helps when I need that miscellaneous thing to take home. Extremely helpful-- don't know how I lived without it!
B000EBMLIY|5|Product and shipping was great.
B00J2CHYZQ|1|To sum it up im fed up with the product it never worked correctly for<br />an extendid period of time 2 months. Constant blowing of bulbs and<br />troubleshooting which i don't have time for. In the end I took it out and will be disposing of it.<br />HID KIT & LED Bulbs This system was installed on a 2012 Toyota Hilux 3year old vehicle<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this, Packaging is very nice which is the only selling point for this product.<br />Verry Poor quality Brackets and materials used to construct this.<br />Support is a waste of time tons of questions and no results just more excuses why it doesnt work.
B000WK6FEI|4|I have bought 3 of these chains over the last year bcuz its the only chain made to handle the power of my hayabusa & its lightweight compared to a 630 or cheap 530. I have a 240 rear tire and keep going thru these chains bcuz they get a slight bend so easily and start taking chunks from my 240 back tire. One actually chipped my wheel. A bend was caused once by the way it was handled when installing it & another from sprocket alignment off 1/8\\" after I only spun wheel to check it. Buy this chain but BE careful not to bend it!
B001TJ70ZE|4|Good mats for the sand and mud. Floor mats logo broke off after the first week of putting them in my jeep. Overall a good floor mat
