B00KL3ALGO|5|These car sun shades work great to keep direct sun off of my toddler. In my car I only need one on the window and in my SUV I use two on one window.
B00Y480W3Y|5|This Portable Car Jump Starter is one of the best Jump Starters available in the current market. Not only does it come with a compact friendly design, it also offers quite a lot of options when it comes to jump starting your car. The following are the most common specifications and features I like about this new Kaska Portable Car Jump Starter.<br /><br />A Built-in Power Bank<br />With this jump starter you should never be worried about getting stuck in no man’s land with nowhere to go or anybody to help you. I like the fact that it has a built-in power bank which has the capability of holding electric current of up to 13600mAh. It’s built in power bank also comes with 3 different power voltages namely 12V, 16V and 19V which all operate on a DC power output. This power voltages perfectly work for my car and I don’t have to be worried about using way to much current that may end up damaging my car battery.<br /><br />7 in 1 Laptop Adapters<br />I love the fact I can easily charge my laptop with this portable jump starter. I attribute all of this thanks to the internally built power bank. A good thing about the adapters is the fact that you can use up to 7 different brands of laptops which have different charging systems or adapters.<br /><br />Compact and Portability<br />If you are looking for a compact and portable jump starter, look no further than this Kaska Jump starter. I love the fact that I can easily carry this jump starter from one place to another thanks to its light weight of only 2.2 ounces.<br /><br />LED Indicator<br />A perfectly in-built LED indictor gives me the freedom to operate and use the jump starter without been worried about its status. This is because; the LED indicator comes with 3 different modes which can stay ON for up to 120 hours. These long durations give me the freedom to check on what’s wrong with the starter and correct the error.<br /><br />Fully Charged Battery<br />With this jump starter, I can easily jump start my carfor up to 3,000 times. Its fully charged battery guarantees me a complete life span of the battery.<br />USB 5V/2.1A<br />This USB Port combines 4 different mobile adapters which give me the freedom to charge 4 different mobile phones, my MP4 players, cameras and a GPS locator just to name a few.<br /><br />Emergency Starter<br />An auto emergency power starter with a voltage of 12 comes with in-built safety features. I don’t have to connect different cables as with manual starters. The starter also recharges the battery and at the same time starts it hence saving me quality time.

B000K1K0U4|5|Have worked as they are intended
B000S2S6ME|5|bon produit merci
B001V3B4YG|5|Great for riding at night!
B006WQSXSW|1|It was the wrong part had seen it back
B003VDX5D2|4|It looks nice, but is a little wobbly when on it.  Still better then carrying a step stool. Folds up nice. Delivery came when they said it would.
B000GU5H9I|4|After ordering this, I found a factory manual.  The Haynes manual is ok and will do the job, but, the factory manual is much better.
B00D99RXI6|1|Rear visors didnt fit well, and one of the rear visors flew off as i was driving..
B0050SYSRS|5|Works great.
B00MS97ZYK|5|Love these lights. Get lots of looks in my hotrod. I also did an evil eye mod on them
B001GP78RG|4|Works great at getting dust off
B0024GR0S8|5|I bought this for my husband as a gift and it has come in handy so many times! From inflating kids bike tires and basketballs to jumping a dead car battery, this has been invaluable. We bring it camping with us as a just in case, and also on road trips. My only complaint is that the pressure gauge no longer works, so you have to guess and check with a separate gauge. In the end though, I have been really pleased with the performance of this product and I would buy it again!
B00JXZKIW8|4|Works pretty good so far, I was a little hesitant about quality because it was made in China. But so far it works great<br />-2006 Honda Civic lx
B002PZA2UG|5|Very happy with this model
B00NL63NB8|5|perfect addition to my new Crosstrek. very nice indeed.
B0033XYBC4|4|Have used it a couple of times and it has worked perfectly.
B003O0VYHQ|5|Inexpensive, installs in a second, works great.
B003SZMGTC|5|I Love it works great
B000ET9SA0|5|patches holes
B0056GUSNM|3|Kinda met my expectations.
B00K889FCI|5|Easy!!! Works amazingly well!!! I went over rack headlight twice with the little pad before applying the 'Wipe New' cloth. After 8 years and 130k miles my headlights are awesome again!!! Like new!!! Living in deer country, my night driving will be greatly improved!!!!!
B00JJZ1SLM|5|These worked great on my 07 Jeep Liberty.
B000R8Y7BS|4|fast shipping, didn't have rubber boot, but jeep rides completely different!  I'm happy, will repost in the future to tell how they hold up. (Installed today)
B000C5I2YO|4|Work good
B000AM8C5I|4|It is goood
B00943S48E|5|5 Stars
B009DJJEFG|3|Cons: Very fragile, clumsy fit, cheaply made.<br />Pros: Inexpensive, nice and bright, look good.
B00HLPSBL2|5|Wasn't sure if it would fit my 2014 QX60<br />Took a chance but now my truck look awesome<br />Shipping was very fast
B00G4L1T8Q|3|The biggest plus for these is the white color, something in the 4300K range. The may be marginally brighter but that is totally subjective. I like the white look and do believe they make the car more visible with the DRLs on. Can't speak to longevity, only have had them for about six months.
B003K20JXI|2|Nice mug ,don't keep drinks hot .
B000F18LR8|5|Great color match & fits perfectly.
B00ED81S0Q|5|very small, but that was expected given it was written in the details. arrived fairly speedy as well! :)
B00LBAF9S6|5|great item fast shipper.
B00T92HQA2|5|These are really good spark plugs they were already gapped ND ready to be installed.
B00FMV0WFA|5|Fits perfectly in my 2015 Silverado high country! Fits in the open center console space and helps with the organization. It is made of black plastic and the coin dispensers have a good quality spring. This was a major influence on my purchase as the new Chevy's don't have a designated spot for loose change. There is absolutely no rattling while driving overall it is a great product for a even better price compared to the dealer's price. Well worth the purchase if you like to keep things organized and don't want the center console to become a catch-all
B00B72QOTQ|5|Just like it come from the factory that way great part.
B00B945P4C|5|Fit like a glove!!
B00UBIMB58|5|Great car detailing product. Easy on and off for show quality shine
B00VS6RLFW|4|Nice
B00RGQ1PDC|5|I Spent more than 6 months searching for the best looking, most useful pilion bag for my Yamaha mt07 and I found it! The bag is amazing. I use it every single day. The &#34;expandable&#34; feature saved me a few times to carry more stuff than I was expected in the first place. Great item, fast shipping over seas. Recommended item/dealer.
B0089YVIIW|5|They did the job on our 2008 Highlander. Hauled a Thule from CT to Maine and back with no problem.
B00R516D3K|5|Good packaging, great cables.
B000IZ3MPC|5|excellent
B005I60VZK|5|Got here fast and works like a dream
B00BFDGL4K|3|Min works fine after 5 months. Now it's dead.
B0060YHLJS|4|These are okay but material made out of is a little hard and does not seem to bite into battery post as much as I like.
B003WHPO9A|5|Love these covers I've been using them for close to 2 years now and they got perfect in my Toyota Corolla!
B00HHGDHZA|5|Perfect decal for our car window. Great quality and easy to apply.
B000NOO798|5|I purchase this for a 2007 Toyota minivan with a head gasket leaking. I followed the direction and it has been 2 weeks since I added the Blue Devil head gasket sealer in the car.  So far so good. I am praying this was the fix because if not it is going to cost $3,500 to $4,500 for a head gasket job. The minivan is running well now.
B000BQW5LK|4|I used the Plews pump today to refill my Transfer case and Rear Differential gear oil. The cap of the pump did not thread onto Red Line Gear oil if that helps anyone. Down one star for that. That being said I just stuck it in the bottle and started pumping. The materials that the pump are made from are quality and the pump tubing is soft and flexible.<br /><br />If you can find a container that the pump will mate with so much the better. For an inexpensive item, it did the trick for me and saved me a lot of time and spillage no doubt. I did have to cycle the pump many times to empty the quart container, but it does work.
B00QFIIDI2|4|So far, it has worked for 2 months. Most of the others we have tried failed within days or weeks. It actually gets too hot after 10 min. or so, especially if the fluid level is low, which I suspect would burn out the internal elements if allowed to continue. I just unplug it, and it stays warm for a while.
B00HQQQZ0K|4|Easy to install, definitely changes lighting of whole car making it much brighter.
B00NQUSNEQ|4|sturdy, looks nice, fits fine.
B00466V9AY|5|Works perfect on my 2004 F150 XLT. Bought another one for a backup.
B00GUD0Y2A|5|I thought it was a short bar..but when It arrived it was a long bar and very nice looking. .I would 100% buy from them again!
B001P24PEY|2|came in was a bit smaller than i thought
B00K1C1WC2|4|Good quality and price.
B000G6M3VC|5|Great product!
B003BZD03K|4|Stops wear on hose.
B00D7QHSKY|5|Exactly what I wanted.<br />Works very well.
B000182DPG|5|I put this K&N prior to a 600 mile road trip and whether it's coincidence or not, but I'd say I averaged about 1 - 1.5 mpg better than my previous trips.  I have a 2009 Maxima and while it doesn't have the same throttle sound as my old Mustang, it's a family-ish car and I don't need that.  I don't feel much difference in driving but I know the car is breathing better with the mpg proof.  You probably won't see the difference as much in city driving but continuous driving on the highway I did.
B00SAAW8Y8|5|Easy install, simple diagram.
B00B76RXRY|5|No problems. Great fit.
B0049IFX56|5|It was a little hard to get it to start but it works well.
B000BG1X54|5|Its works great!
B00N7C2O6G|5|nice bulbs
B00KTHY49C|5|Very easy to use. Perfect fit.
B002AUE0MC|3|the price was right but I think the material is a bit on the thin side, I will just have to see how long they last and how they wear.
B00O9G8RO2|4|Had to buy different screws. Otherwise fine.
B000EDUUHQ|5|Keeps all my stuff from falling out!! I love it especially because we go to the dessert alot so the roads are extremely bumpy & holds everything in no problem
B006IV6CAW|5|My husband put it on his golf cart.  Loves the thing, me, not so much.
B00IS94KME|5|nice brackets fit good but you need better hardware to install
B006K92P4O|5|Everything seems fine with it.
B00H95ZZUY|5|Product was what i expected
B003BZQ6U4|5|Work as intended
B00X6HFCQG|4|Have ordered more because it has faded due to the extreme sun... I feel strongly about the symbolism of what this flag stands for so I have 5 more on the way to me. I do wish they slid onto the pole and lasted longer.
B00JC6XOAG|1|Did not like the paint delivery system. Difficult to use although I followed the instruction completely. Did not dispense well and did not cover scratch even after second application.
B0007M1UO6|5|Works as expected.  Easy to install and seems to be sturdy enough.
B000CPCBEQ|5|My Z shifts like it should.
B00KBBL4H6|5|The gauge is still performing well, which is more than I can say for two other gauges from other dealers.
B00HWPYU6Q|1|what do u expect for 6 bucks. When mine got stolen I ordered this one . It lasted a week and flew of my hood
B00GSAUHB8|5|Perfect fit for my truck!
B0021JMWKE|4|Very nice, all metal, hard to fit due to over sized grommet.
B00630IZYO|4|smells great, labeling is a bit odd as most of the packets are hand written labels. It is a bit strong to keep constantly plugged in so I only plug it into car for brief periods of time and then put it in tray for remainder to diminish the smell. Overall wished that the scents were a bit more predictable and contained a scratch and sniff on outside to know what I will be getting instead of a label that says &#34;attention&#34; or &#34;awake.&#34;
B00OYR8PQ6|5|These set of DRL and Fog light are so great.  The dimensions are as indicated a they really fit perfectly.
B006E0KS8Y|5|Fits my 2005 Toyota Sinnea AWD, the AWD does make a difference....
B003DUFBRQ|3|Works well. Must have aftermarket rims. Would also lock the items down. Expensive jack and gas held down by a screw.
B00EC0Z8AG|5|Every shop wanted to replace my cracked mirror for $200+.  This was so incredibly easy to do.  Just unsnap the old mirror and snap this one on!
B0006MRR6W|5|Is just what we needed.
B0080HJL7S|5|This bag works great for garbage, and surprisingly it also worked good as a mini cooler for drinks !  I know it wasn’t intended for this but what a bonus I must say.  I drive a large truck as I have a family of 4 and this bag comes in very handy especially with two kids in the back.  I actually own two of these bags as I feel they are a good way to keep things tidy.  - item received as part of promo for review
B00NFPTTZE|2|Was nearly impossible to apply and tore in several places while attempting to apply. Wouldn't order from same place again. Have local shop now that makes superior decals.
B00RGZWIW0|5|this product is quality constructed and it looks nice. I highly recommend it
B001P6GONU|4|I use it for important docs, flash drives etc... very simple.
B005U804JO|4|Arrived with a few scratches but nothing I couldn't fix. Easy to install but the instructions are all but useless.
B00B2AFO4E|5|Great product
B0009VIQ1A|5|What s great ptoduct
B00MBNOHW6|1|It did not work won't send back because to expensive
B00GPC2XZC|5|Great handguards! The usual Acerbis style and quality and definitely worth the price. The LED lights are surprisingly bright, very adjustable, and absolutely contribute additional light while riding at night. It's a killer look on my KTM. If I did have complaints, it would be the lack of wiring for the power supply (you will need to make your own wire/connections) and also the fact that they use phillip-head screws rather than allen-head for the small amount of assembly required. Be aware, this is more of a cosmetic accessory and it won't hold up to any serious/repeated drops. Not a durable off-road handguard! Other than that, great product and I would recommend to others.
B000GTV7HA|5|You can put this on while the engine is still hot. After the bike cools down I put a full cover on top of this so the UV can not penetrate both layers.
B002O17ZNI|5|HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH.
B00T7CE0YY|5|nice and looks good
B0040CRREG|5|Worked fine no issue on 2009 HOnda Civic EX
B00JS9WMGO|5|These are a perfect replacement for hubcaps that were stolen. Looks exactly like originals minus the logo in the middle. Easy to snap onto tire and makes the car look pretty again.
B00H6XPZN6|2|ok
B0072W5PFO|2|Is not working in my car !
B008535CTS|4|Nice.  Fit Perfectly.  Wish top was a little thicker grade material, however, it is well made and certainly worth the economical price.  Very satisfied.
B001NZS9ZY|3|Item received does not look like the picture. As others have mentioned, it seems to be a cheaper version that has an exposed spring, and the housing is chrome instead of black. However, the product worked just fine in my 1989 Jeep Comanche 4.0L and my motor is running way smoother now.
B0071LF4FM|5|I had one like it but was unable to find another one for backup until you. Thank you.We are dairy farmers and use it to see the cows early in the morning.It's the best we've ever found.
B000C58046|5|Perfect fit and worked well.
B00JF5LRN0|5|Great
B005BNP7UO|4|I was very pleased by the unit. It works well and looks good.  It's a lot of fun to impress your friends with it!  However, having said that, my unit broke in the car wash.  The plate pulled loose from the receiver insert and tore the wires.  I like it so much, I'm going to buy another one and remove it before each car wash.
B00LPWKQ56|4|Manufacturing quality is on par with K@N but the filter fitment is not the same as OEM. it was 1.5 inch less in thickness (highly) compare to the filter in 2012 Sienna.
B001KOZ05U|5|great product
B00CDDBAQU|5|Simply an outstanding tool.
B001D9E41I|5|works awesome on our travel trailer windows to keep the street lights or sun out of the door windows! very easy to install and so far they have worked perfectly!
B000NW6W6Q|5|save you time and money if you are installing new accumulator. I used the old one but it leaked so I bought new switch and no issues.
B00594OIWS|5|Looks great and the quality is excellent...
B0009IBJE4|5|This is a good battery charger.  My dad uses this for truck and tractor batteries and says it works great.
B004AIJ0W2|5|I got what I paid for.. Just like I expected. Thanks!
B00UVQ5HJW|4|LOVE IT!!! But the picture and product is different. It doesn't come on a key ring which is sort of disappointing but I still love it!!!!!
B001LTVHD8|5|Awesome product, everything included: gaskets, bolts etc.
B0068ESIXI|5|I didn't buy them from Amazon, but I knew this was the item I needed for my short shots.  I called V&H directly and they sent them to me free of charge.  My plate and screws came off after hitting a pot hole on the freeway.  This is a good replacement item.
B007KFMF1U|5|These are awesome!
B006MM3OQ2|5|It's works good. Better then paying $300.+ for the same starter from the Polaris dealer.
B004IPWLK0|5|This is an excellent pump for my camaro. 500hp ls3, pushes 70psi all day long and just as quiet as a stock pump. Much beefier than a stock pump. The center inlet is nice and is about a half inch in diameter. The supplied wiring is nice as well. Would definetly reccommend this pump. Excellent pump for the price. I had an aeromotive inline pump before this one but was too loud. This small, compact pump pushes just as hard as the inline version at 30% the cost. Excellent. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B00LLZFIK0|5|Fantastic Item.  Very useful
B000HBM5S2|5|Work like a charm.I used the permatex on my cars weather stripping,one can was enough to do the double seals on all 4 doors plus the seal on the trunk deck.I highly recommened it.
B00CQAR1C2|5|Was afraid that installing this myself would be very difficult but was pleasantly surprised to find it fit perfectly the first time. Good product so now need to do window shades
B00EKTJFLW|3|Look and quality are perfect. Fitment however isn't that great. The actual handle cover hangs on the outer cover when you open the tailgate but after you open it just a quick push of the handle back in as you are letting tailgate down fixes problem. I am sure that after a time it will show wear.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent!  I love it!
B00E3ST48E|4|Met all expectations!
B000CP0G1G|1|if you purchase the bully tailgate tr-02wk you dont need it
B0041TU56A|5|Good thanks
B00OHCUHPK|5|son loves them
B0002U2V1Y|5|My first try at a clay bar and I must say it was awesome. Easy to use and great result!
B00KS3BGAM|5|son loves them
B00JQQZAA4|4|Great OEM replacement
B00K7VE2VK|5|Today was my third time washing the car with the Enthusiasts only product. The entire car looks great and it took less than an hour. The solution also works well for other household cleaning like doors, the microwave, and the inside of the dishwasher. When my supply runs out I will likely buy again from Enthusiasts.
B00Q6EXNVW|5|Working Great the LS is back on the road!
B0030634X6|5|I bought these for my boyfriends truck and they look Amazing.  Installing was very simple I could figure it out myself.  Installing is just as easy as changing the bulbs.  Totally worth the money
B00FFAUQ68|5|Exactly as expected at a reasonable price and fast shipping.  Our family vacation was saved by Amazon after our RV manufacturer forgot to install an exhaust pipe and running the genset would have poisoned us (luckily the CO detector was working properly and warned us!)
B000630D3A|5|Great price
B004GCS7GC|5|Looks and works like the OE.
B00HL9UT18|4|These items took about 5 weeks to arrive from CHINA. Although shown in a variety of colors, I received only black. Hmmm..... They work well, being extremely tacky and will keep whatever you put on them from sliding all over the dash of your car. Recommend, but be prepared to wait for a long time for delivery and expect only black....
B0009JKGJW|5|Will buy again. Use in Fuel and oil to free up sticky lifter.
B00390BS7C|5|Helps when there is a tight fitted oxygen sensor.
B0039538RK|5|These fit perfectly and so easy to snap on.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I bought this for the leather seats in a used 2009 MKZ and Leather Nova gave it a very nice appearance and left the leather softer. I had the same result with a new leather and vinyl office chair. Good product for perforated leather.
B00R92O1QQ|1|These are WAY to dim to be low beams. I thought buying LED would be brighter but I can hardly see and now have to use my highbeams at night.  I do not recommend.  Not sure if the wattage was too low or what but they are terrible.
B004RINXPA|1|I just wanted to say that I am highly unhappy with this purchase. I placed the order August 4th and the product is currently about a month old and is already wearing really fast. It is very flakey and falling apart making my car a mess! It is also very flimsy and a tad too small for my car. Does a decent job at keeping the sun out but I would not purchase this product again.
B00BAZBYTU|4|Very good product!
B004VSCQFE|5|This is the only product I have found that keeps a new car leather smell for about a month at a time. I will usually put 4 in my truck at a time and they last a little over a month. I have turned a friend on to the wonder wafers (& he even smokes) the wafers have totally killed his smoke smell. Best orderizing product on the market without having to put ugly clips on all the vents. True leather smell!
B000UK67G6|5|Great filter fits like original !
B0018YD2PW|3|These are great shocks, they are comfortable for a lifted vehicle and would use them again especially considering the amount of money for the alternatives, such as bilstein or fox. The reason they received only 3 stars is because one of the main reasons we purchased them was because of them being adjustable. We understand that you will never get close to a stock ride with a lifted vehicle, however there in our opinion there is no adjustment, yes there is a dial from 1-9 but we're here to tell you it might as well just be 1 & 9, if there was a difference between 1 and 5 we could not tell at ALL. it is the same ride. 9 is stiff for the desert roads and what you need for that.
B00KQ5ZRAM|5|I wanted to raise the front of my Cherokee 2&#34; and In about 2 hours I got the results I Iwanted.
B00MI7LMLO|5|exactly what I needed. Thanks!!
B005OVM1KC|1|I just want everyone to know. This item does not come with the motor. It is the regulator only.
B00ZY1LS6A|5|great gift!
B005N00FB6|5|love it.
B000KL8RKO|4|It fitswonderfully  No wind noise, and looks nice
B00W4G3WSK|5|What should come on a new gas can. Price too high
B00FKYS3PU|3|workcfor bmw 2003 325i  need 2in shorc tube
B00EC2C726|1|They cut easily against my trailer. Never had that problem in the past.
B0035R5P3M|5|Installed and ride great.  Just what I needed.
B0006IX7Y2|5|Great support for RV hose while camping on sites that support individual site dumping.  No more finding rocks and sticks, this system gives you dependable even support.
B001HJ60NE|4|looks good, but the gasket arrived kind of bent.
B00EQMOC8E|1|Don't fit
B006R34PB4|1|These products came loose to the tip and weren't making contact properly leaving a constant flickering when which eventually went dead.... 2 days after.
B001LHVOVK|5|Always wanted one....so i know whats going on before i take my car to the shop!
B000CFEZWM|4|Fit perfect, works well.
B00B5FJP0A|4|My baby looks allot better with these shiny bad boys!
B0009JKGEM|3|Product doesn't work well.
B0002SQU8Q|5|Perfect for drum brake jobs. Something to say for having right tool for the job.
B009PAK75E|5|Fits Just Write and The Pink is Bright ! I love it !
B004TRKBOK|1|Junk.
B00KM79M1Y|2|Hardly as blue as I wanted it, I painted it over a gray bace and a black bace the black had the most blue but for the most part it's just green paint
B000CLBKEW|5|Love it. Bought two more for other family cars
B001XLG5FE|5|The parcel arrived in good condition, the windshield fits perfect and looks great! 😀
B0001XPC7C|5|Works great in our Subaru Outback Center console. I used some 3M, low-profile Dual-Lock and it quickly attaches or removes inside and gives us a spot for that loose change.
B00UUQHANE|5|Very nice product!
B00BP5Q5PS|5|Excellent product. Great value. They look good and have a better feel than some more expensive brands.<br />I am very happy with the purchase and will buy at least one more set.
B00GSAUHB8|5|As promised
B00GBJZ2WK|5|Great brake pads, not sure how much better they are over stock, but mine were going out anyways and this replacement was cheap and works well
B003ZOH63W|5|Picked up way more channels then the old original sensar model, even in HD. good purchase
B00U6CBAEW|4|I like this, but I am not in love with it. I have an Audi Q5 and it was slightly too big for my car and with my rear trunk cover type thing on it makes it harder to see in the pockets and to get anything from the pockets. Overall, its a keeper, I am not 100% sure I would order it again... Perhaps for a larger SUV yes, but for my Q5... eh I'm up in the air. I did not initially plan to keep it, as I wasn't crazy about it for 30 bucks for 20 yeah its  better, but 30 is a bit high for my satisfaction level...
B0013VT5N8|5|As advertised
B006RY7WE0|5|recommended item and recommeded seller.
B00VSH42NK|3|Good except had to trim rubber ring to make fit but all good otherwise
B008FRFC8U|1|Don't buy used 5 times and wires in plug came apart. It was bright and worked good when it worked.
B007G2IH4Q|1|This only works on a hard, level surface. It will never work on a hill on gravel.<br />I suppose I should have thought of that.
B001PNU0Z6|2|The cord has a hard time retracting, so I mainly just use it as an ordinary auxiliary plug in
B000NW6WDO|5|i have replaced my old blade &#34; 7 blades&#34; with this one that has 9 blades and it is a perfect fit for my Chevy Tahoe 2007. I got more air flow as a result better performance Air conditioning,
B001TWD5KU|5|Great lights. Wiring diagrams hard to follow since they were in black and white instead of color.
B00HZCGS2A|3|Has a white background - i thought it would be clear - my mistake.
B000PAM9KO|5|Super easy to install.  I looked up a YouTube video on how to do it and had the old one out and this one in quickly and easily.  A huge savings over what the shop would have charged me to do it.
B00O0SRAK6|4|they are super bright just didn't fit in my grill otherwise highly recommended
B00KL3ALGO|5|Works great!
B00UY2COP8|4|This is a great product that solves an annoying problem in a clever way. For years I have been consistently coming inches away from slamming the front of my Grand Prix into the concrete steps at the front of my garage. I am not about to suspend sports equipment from my ceiling, and the blinking stop sign I got from a garage sale eventually broke from all of the times I knocked it over. The appeal of this laser guide was that it seemed more accurate and less obtrusive than other gadgets (a pretend traffic light on the wall is almost as bad as hanging sports equipment).<br /><br />Well, it is accurate, and it's not obtrusive. I have the two-laser white model with a bonus LED light. I followed the advice of another reviewer and installed a combo power socket/bulb fixture in my door opener. That way the laser guide only comes on when the door has recently been opened or closed. (If you do this, you'll probably want to use a 100W CFL bulb, as it might cause the bulb to press against a plastic surface and man do those 100W bulbs get hot! Even the LED ones do) I have a white extension cord and the laser unit's white power cord secured to the ceiling, and the laser unit itself sits above a walkway. (Remember to install it where you can reach it with cars in the garage) Everything blends in with the white ceiling nicely.<br /><br />I had a concern that the laser beam would be difficult to see when actually trying to park. No problem there. What is difficult is the adjustment. I have a very small garage with about a foot of wiggle room before I'm either covering the walkway or hitting the car with the garage door. Side-to-side, it's about the same or less if I want to be able to open the doors on both sides. So I was trying to hit an area on both cars that is about a square inch in size in order to really get that accurate parking location. It was pretty difficult to do that. The lasers use a ball and socket type connection, but in order to move the dot an inch you have to nudge it about five and hope it comes back to the place you want. So if you want to be more accurate than about 3 inches, be prepared to finagle. That ended up being my biggest issue. I will say that the single-beam version, which doesn't seem to have any side-to-side adjustment, looks like it would be a pain. The reference point on your car may not happen to line up with the vertical line the beam can reach. So I'd get the double beam even if I had just one car.<br /><br />My other complaint is with the LED light. There's hardly any difference in price, so I thought I'd go ahead and get it. Well, imagine one of those really cheap LED flashlights (a dim one) stuck to your ceiling. The bluish light looks really cheap when you have actual light bulbs on at the same time, and since it kinda has to be located at the front of your garage, chances are it's not going to be illuminating some dark corner of the garage. Plus it's weird that they give you double-sided tape, which can't be used in a ceiling mount, and meanwhile this LED light can't be turned off which would make it really obnoxious for a wall mount. I guess the fact that it's a motion-activated light might make it useful for someone, but not for me since it's only on when the opener light is already on in the first place.<br /><br />I haven't had the issues other people describe in regard to the quick shut-off times. In fact I felt like it was impossible to see it turned off because the motion sensor picked up my movement. I have no idea how you could be moving a car under this without triggering the motion sensor. But if you look you will see that some of those reviews are quite old. For me the minor problems don't get in the way of a full recommendation. Chris gives the MAXSA Dual Laser Park Right in White 4 stars.
B000C9J4VA|1|Holy heck do not buy these.  They are out of spec for your parking brakes and will not fit.  I spent 1k and a month of frustration getting the XC90 parking brake working again.  Buy OEM volvo rotors only for the rear!  Front aftermarket rotors are okay.
B005GY9XVW|5|Perfect for our fifth wheel
B00MIJQL7C|3|Read the rules of your state first. I learned it is illegal to use here in Florida. Though many people have them. You can get a ticket for it.
B0002SR0X0|4|Works fine.
B0031XQRNW|5|Was a perfect fit!!
B000DINKPQ|5|Great sounding horn ordered again.
B00HY06FAI|5|love the blue LED looks so cool
B002BHWZFI|2|It dried up with the container sealed in weeks.  Get the spray type.<br /><br />Other than that the actual product works great.
B0021USOM8|5|Worked great
B004R2Y64S|4|Study the instructions carefully and the installation goes well. I have experienced no whistling nor decrease in gas mileage, but have also not rigorously measured it. I carry a 38 Lb canoe which is not critical as to weight but can be a real issue from an aerodynamic standpoint. So far so good. Must use front tie downs that control both pitch and yaw. (Up and down, left and right)
B003D32OK0|5|Required slight modifications to location in order to fit, but only had to reduce size of hole in wall.
B00JHEG7UW|4|Very great quality headlights. I've had them on the truck for over a year and still no problems at all!!
B003900JXG|5|engine will not run right without it. factory part
B000WJJ83Y|4|Worked great for about 2 weeks recommend making the 5 pin connector a little longer for grabbing. Strengthen the strain relief .
B00Z1RCRUI|5|Very nice merchandise
B002NZL6M6|4|Goes on and comes off easy while leaving no white residue. Shine is good but not that deep. As far as durability it seems to be holding up well but it only has been on a month or so.
B00LM55Y0S|1|Not at all like watermelon, had to take it right of the car.
B00K6976RK|5|Not using these in the normal auto application but they work great and are bright.
B00ELR3YO2|5|Worked like a charm. Hubby installed them himself and saved us big bucks by not having the dealership do it.
B000668S9I|4|I like it  !!
B002YCEIRS|5|Outstanding! Met expectations and completely satisfied.
B008YHWMGG|5|Instant gas mileage back to 500km per tank !
B00MXF4N8U|1|Didn't work
B000CB5UFW|5|exactly what I was looking for, perfect fit
B0002SQYV4|1|Very disappointed. Purchased due to other reviews on how great this product is. I expected it to help clean my vinyl seat covers on my pontoon boat. This is a new boat so there is not any rubbed in crime/dirt. Want to keep it looking good. It had basically no effect on any dirt that was on the seats, I found a mild mixture of dishwashing liquid and water did a far superior job. Do not know if it would protect the fabric any, but since I have it I put it on the vinyl after cleaning with the dishwashing soap and water. Would not purchase again.
B001RUW4GU|4|It is a bit too snug for my phone but I am using it as a pen holder and business card file. Soft rubbery plastic so ti is secure in the cup holder.
B001CH9736|3|not very good didn't really make any difference at all
B0079QRRRM|5|Great
B008RJM2ES|5|nice
B00MJCYYMM|5|Easy to install. Took less than an hour. The only problem is the instructions are not complete. There were a few parts that the instructions did not even say what they were let alone how and where to put them on. Luckily I build things all the time so I figured it out. The more unexperienced person would have trouble. But the product does look good on my truck.
B00EOYL6DS|5|Works great
B004DLV4U2|5|worked great!
B0016I0GW2|4|Nice item for the money
B000GZGMQK|5|no problem
B00NFD7U9S|3|The fit was 2 out of 5 stars - it could have been a bit longer in the back . I had to use a heat gun and stretch the back of the cover so I could wrap it and glue it.<br />The stitch was 3 out of 5 stars - stitches could have been tighter with a better thread.<br />The fabric was 2 out of 5 stars - color is good, grain is off and thickness is fine, but no under padding like on the factory piece.<br />The price was 4 out of 5 stars - this was the least expensive route to fix the torn factory fabric.<br />You will need some auto upholstery glue and a heat gun or good hair dryer and some time. Take your time, and let the glue set up before you glue it otherwise your fabric will not stick. Use the heat gun to stretch fabric where you need to but do not overheat the fabric.<br />All in all mine turned out really good for the price, a lot less expensive than buying a new center console lid.
B004AIIVUO|5|Came fast - worked great
B0028JQYSS|1|stop working after first use
B000W3RU9Y|2|After using them a few times they lose their strength I would stay away..
B00U4JB6EQ|5|Fit my 79 xlh no problem
B000CNN26E|5|Sounds good on the 95 silvarado with a couple turn downs little louder than the 50 series  got that drone till it hits overdrive its nice
B000FGEF6Y|3|Compartments are great. It did not come with a screw, so on quick turns it does tend to slide. But for just normal driving it's good.
B00M1LCAWC|5|Very bright and good build quality
B000EQS1XI|4|Work great and was a direct fit
B001AIZ5HY|5|It really worked great and was very easy to use.
B005G527HI|5|great quality!
B00E1ETJNU|3|Worthless, the bottom part of it is so large it covered up the area where the registration goes. Probably a great frame (made of a nice metal) if you don't have your sticker  on the bottom of the plate. Sending it back :(
B00KMDARLW|5|Fast shipping and fits my vehicle.
B001GRX6M0|5|Great product !!! Good craftsmanship...
B00OXKR2MC|5|Absolutely love these. They are great and keep my purse off the floor
B000C2Q1O0|5|tons of extra for whatever system you have, just make sure to match the o-ring and gasket to the one coming off or you will be bummed.
B000JZZE6G|5|AC Delco is the only way to go when replacing any parts on your Chevy....
B005OZQDUW|5|perfect fit-had to have ford set it as I only had one, but guy was nice and did it for free<br />they should anyway gosh
B002I2PKGW|5|Very easy to install
B00AEJD8ZQ|5|Great price
B000C8Z6W2|5|Works 100%
B001JKXJF8|5|I was skeptical, but it totally works! I got the side windows, and it keeps my truck surprisingly cooler, er uh, in West Texas, I guess it's just not blistering hot, but they fit great, work great, and blind the $hit outta me when I'm taking it down, and fall prey to the reflection from the sun, bouncing and magnifying into my eye sockets, and burning my soul rings. What are soul rings?  If you don't know, you probably can't afford them, and an Amazon search will turn up empty for you, because Amazon knows.<br /><br />I just wish I could get these for all of the windows in my truck... and house... and soul.
B0002STTPW|5|Works perfectly. Keeps me from snapping off tabs.
B004GCDU32|4|Fit like a charm. It also came with the inserts to attach it to the bumper.
B00NAGI70Q|4|Great piece, looks good on the side of my KIA Optima.
B0096BAS2Y|5|Ordered it for my 1999 Honda accord.  Packaging was great.  Nice and secure.  Got here earlier than expected and fits like a glove.  Even came with a radiator cap.
B00BPVS1Q8|5|-hard body and really tough looking. glad I bought it.  I couldn't put it on the handle bars because of the Harley logo block in the center of the handle bar so I decided to try and put it on the medal frame on the windshield. I did this without the straps and it seems to work except I can't get to the buckles.  I'm going to continue working with it and see if I can't get it to work. But overall, it's REALLY a tuff bag.
B010MAAWLY|5|oem part
B00DD31A3M|5|Looks great and fits great!
B0049JGAB6|5|Way to quiet for my taste but how is that a complaint? I have to look at the speedometer to make sure it is running. Installed as an exact OEM fit with no altering or fabricating.My truck runs a lot smoother as well. Very well built looking muffler,it is stainless, and it is not very heavy,looks like it will outlast my truck.
B003LM9EWO|5|The weather rubber mats fits 2012 Mercedes Benz C300- 4 Matic:)
B00A5UEOLG|5|Worked perfect. Install in 60 seconds.  Not sure why others are posting it does not fit. It fits perfect, build it inside the box.
B0085SP55Y|5|Good pipes for the money.
B00JYXN34Y|4|Great product good buy...
B00BFDHX9C|5|Perfect.
B001G8AIMU|1|Complete waste of money.  I did something I've never done before, and went with a suggested pairing &#34;others who bought this battery bought this charger&#34; without bothering to read reviews.  My mistake.  This is not even a battery charger.  As other have stated it's a crappy 12v power supply with gator clip ends - it should not be sold as a battery charger.  Do yourself a favor and buy the Black and Decker charger seen here:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00<br /><br />$19.00, but actually trickle charges 12v or 6v batteries and shuts itself off once the battery is charged.
B00IA8J6W2|2|The anode does not fit on my outdrive.
B00480J4QY|5|By far the best halogens I have owned. Shine a great white light! I have had them for about 2 years now and they are going strong. Would recommend them to anyone who wants to have a brighter and white light. Best light for the price!
B003K0PX86|5|great arrival was fast and quality is great
B000EQCXE6|5|Can't beat a proper OE filter.
B004ZF4AFM|5|Great product and very reliable HID KIT, been using that brand for several years now and always exceed my expectations. And excellent customer service.
B001OMLDZY|5|this cover is well built. I would buy it again
B006QC36K2|4|Fits perfectly. Easy to install with included tool. Might give it 5 stars if it holds up to fork mount bike rack with mountain bike (as I've yet to use this set up) without any creaks or squeaks. I was pleasantly surprised that it shipped from an actual Subaru dealer as OEM.
B000OQIGA6|5|Handy tool for changing oil instead of using a pump. I have 5 diesel and 1 gas engines that I maintain. Some have areas where as much as 3 quarts of oil doesn't drain to the pan. In order to replace all the oil and get a clean change I use this to suck out the remaining oil. It easier than using a hand pump.
B00SI6NPS2|5|Thank you!!
B00TTLR8VK|5|Yum. Grape koolaid scented soap.<br /><br />Pair this with the bubble wand that Chemical Guys carry and its super sudsy
B00MVATPRG|5|My Ford 4.0 V6 pushrod engine set shipped same day from Riverside CA, and got here to San Diego the next day.  My mechanic says the carbon graphite head gaskets compared well to Fel-Pro, and the head bolts look legit, at a great price.  My online research indicated Evergreen gasket kits get good marks for completeness, which I'm counting on.
B00JBIDKT0|5|Better than stock headlights
B008VQ64G4|5|Outstanding  fits great.
B00TX42T1W|2|Cnt figure it out it has my truck tacking an 40mph has let out for it to shirft the color changer is cool
B004I12MXU|4|Excellent  fast shipping and fit perfect
B00SSFGDXW|5|These leds were much brighter than I anticipated.
B007ULXTD2|5|Super cute... Bought the simple rhinestone plate cover for the front and this one for the back.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.
B00V6J7Z2U|5|Excellent quality product!
B00FG8KY98|5|My SAAB 9000 Aero is running much cooler than it was with the one-row radiator that it came with (installed by previous owner).  Just be sure to have a selection of metric screws on hand for the attachment fittings, i.e. the oil cooler; the original radiators used some sheet metal screws into the plastic end tanks - and there's no plastic here!  Highly recommended.
B00OU5WQ08|3|It shipped fast, packaging protection was &#34;so so&#34; but it got here. It didn't fit my bike and had to send it back. that part was fine and got my credit right away
B000CQDKMW|3|Not a tight fit.
B00JFGBL58|5|Perfect for the car
B004P1WMDI|5|I am excited to say this helped my top look and feel great. My top is about a year old I treated it before winter and after but it was dry and dull. With bestop it is smooth shiny and soft. I am convinced that this product will extend the life of my top. I am very pleased with this purchase and this is my new go to for my jeep top.
B0002JMU2U|4|OEM...does the job.
B00B51Y3DS|5|Awesome product. Color match perfect,fast shipping.
B0058WXNOK|4|Haven't tried it yet, but should work for me.
B000CLV3QW|5|High quality and fit as described.
B00V4NBVC8|2|did not come with banjo bolt or washers shown in picture. had to drill and tap to make oem banjo bolt work. mounting holes are not threaded like factory. reservoir is TINY and remote res hose it not same diameter as factory so couldn't use factory. git it to work but not very happy with the mods I had to to being it says it fits my 2011 hyosung gt250r
B002VJYAK4|5|Fit my 2004 Toyota Tacoma Pre-Runner perfect. Paired them with Bilstein 4600 series struts and the truck rides, handles, and brakes much better now.
B002DPBI74|5|OK, I was worried based on some of the reviews here.  But I bought it anyway because I really like the idea of not having to replace the darn thing every few years...  All I can tell you is I slapped it right on, fit like a glove, and it is so smooooooth. Easy rolling, easy to pop up and down, very easy cranking...  I will never go back to the other type...
B000IHWEWM|5|Very nice tool. I have a similar impact driver, which works fine, but it's a little clunky and difficult to select Left vs. Right. I purchased this tool after reading the reviews and was very pleased with the design and build quality. It selects direction more smoothly than my other impact driver and seems to transfer the force of the hammer blow a bit more directly than my other tool. Handle has a good feel to it. Overall, as picky as I am when it comes to tools, this earned a coveted space in my 1/2 socket drawer.
B00GOO3KI0|1|It came broken
B00BD4VFFG|4|Good and came on time!
B00FMONBSC|5|Got this couple weeks ago and had my dealership install and have to say I love it.  Its is a tad large but does make people look at it that is for sure.  I have to say I dont think I would want to install myself its very large and heavy.  It feels like it will hold up really well to.  I also got there Westin 21-23715 Pro Traxx 4&#34; Oval Step Bar I like those to but I wish I had gone with 5&#34;.  I will say it is over kill for most people I got it cause I wanted something that stands out and this one does just that.
B0006N5RW2|5|Just what I needed.  Seems to be a big stronger and better made than what came with my trailer.  Happy with the purchase.
B00EVB5OAU|4|Would've been a 5 if it came with instructions.
B00N1GBLLW|4|I AM PLEASED WITH THIS ITEM.
B000C94DQQ|5|Fantastic
B00684TD6O|5|Follow the instructions on the website/video that come with the remote. Easy to follow and program. Took me about 2-3 minutes to get this going.
B00CVVUQ50|1|BMW Z4 E89 2010. As other have said it WILL TURN tinted YELLOW in the sun the plastic sides and the fiber material on the inside. Also You will have to make sure you have the plastic grommet with some glue to hold it in place.
B001O4CIHY|5|My second one love them
B000CB3X88|3|Shipping container was to large.
B0020KWCTA|2|Drivers side high beam does not work !!!!!!!!!
B00HAAX2J4|4|It fits my Thunderbird. Its made in Canada. Just because of that it gets four stars. its one of the few pieces of automotive parts not made in China. Its also the OEM brand for the car. The only reason it gets docked one point is because it made me reuse the old nut because it only came with one new nut. Also the boot is clear; but that's okay, its not made in china, so I trust it more than the junk sold in stores.  Also for some Reason Amazon is using the old part number. The part number according to TRW and what was on the box is JTS861
B000CIT3NU|5|The best oil filter on the market.
B00C5T6TNG|5|shipping fast, very good quality, fit very well on my RV
B0081MEG4A|5|lightweight and crystal clear on top and on bifocal bottom

B002Q1OCSM|5|awesome product
B001C6N7M4|5|Worked great
B000VKODIO|5|Easy replacement and inexpensive compared to having the car dealer do it.
B005C5F7B0|5|The delivery showed up on time the product was great I'd recommend them to a friend
B003FWVBHG|5|heavy duty and nicely made! best I have owned...
B0082ANA0C|5|product good
B00LPIA3T4|4|good product
B00B62M2FC|5|Perfect fit, made in the USA, pretty hard to argue with.  One note: be sure to double-check the WeatherTech website for the correct part number for your truck. Seems Ram made some rolling changes to the retention hooks throughout a couple year models, but the WeatherTech website is on top of it, while some Amazon listings are not.  Just answer their questions there and you'll get the right one.
B00SLKG4S8|5|Good price
B00698FFKW|5|Works great ....
B000IEAWN8|5|Installed on 2006 Ford F-150. Works great!! The performance improvement is awesome and the modified shift parameters really makes a world of difference especially while towing. Able to re-program computer to correct speedometer for larger tire size. The INCLUDED dash pod fits great on the dash and looks factory. Edge Products does have a newer/updated model of this might have been worth the investment
B008YLP2BY|5|Absolutely perfect fit and easy to install
B00B0Z1B5M|5|Excellent fit
B007XE5LTG|5|the on the fly reading works wonderfully
B002UWGYCE|5|Product works well
B00BFWK7JG|3|The construction quality is very good, especially considering the price point. I have a 42 inch chest and bought a 44 jacket and it fits perfectly. The pants are a little longer going one size up but not to an extent that they would be unwearable. Knee pucks are not included, and the size of the back protector is much smaller than the picture makes it seem. There is plenty of built in armor and the leather is of good enough quality that you could go to any canyon road or track day and feel safe.
B00R6XE8CU|4|Good product
B00X96V0JM|5|Great product!!!
B008LMY118|5|Is very good

B00RW7XD1W|4|These work pretty well and were packaged better than other name brand wipers.
B00IKYSEKQ|5|I like it very much.
B0010GI2KS|5|Appears to be an exact replacement for my 2006 Duramax.
B00DCF251C|5|Great fit, feel like Jax when riding😉
B004A2WONA|5|Great affordable brakes perfect fit
B00HESVTPQ|5|My husband replaced the broken one with this one.  Everything fit perfectly in place except the switch is on the opposite side.  The cover wasn't used because our propane tank holder is above the winch.  The only problem he said he had was getting the wire wrapped initially to wrap onto the winch, but he just diligently worked at it and it got done!  It works great!  It is louder than the original one we had, but I expected that after reading other reviews!
B000C2QMTE|1|Does not fit a 1980 Toyota 4x4 pickup.
B004A34G94|5|Easy to install and works great
B00P99KKAM|5|Love it! Keeps steering real cool even in extremely hot sun. Very comfortable and ergonomic. No offensive toxic odor.
B00CQW8XAY|4|Looks good almost perfect!!!!!
B00EF3SAJQ|4|Decent quality for temporary use.  I would consider a higher quality / more expensive set up if you need long term use.
B000C7YLEW|5|So far has worked great and fixed the problem nicely.price was good as well
B00VF0OSFC|5|The price is high
B00HZH66ZY|3|The Superchip was as advertised in providing the ability to change tire sizes and shifting patterns for oversized tires.  The TPMS ability of the superchip appears lacking with the software update crashing and then after successful update the superchip not having the ability to make changes to the vehicle.  The fuel mileage improvement after recalibration does improve, but I am not experiencing the gains other have had.  I am not getting factory mileage on 33 in tires.
B00K3A6ENE|5|Very pleased. Quality item. Fast shipping. Thanks!
B0012TWRQS|5|Product was perfect, brought my yzf 600r to life
B0095XQ5YS|5|tks
B001V8U12M|5|Install on cordless drill and works great.
B00G620ZVU|3|These are ok for the price don't expect high quality for  low price its just not happning to mee they look more like flood lights
B00IJSYVJ6|5|I highly recommend this jacket.  The zip-in liner provides extra protection for cooler weather, but I have been wearing just the outer in 90 degree weather without complaint.  The air vents and design provide plenty of air flow inside the jacket. It is cut well for a woman's figure, doesn't ride up in the back at all, and armor is comfortable.  True to size: I wear a women's medium in general and the medium in this jacket fits perfectly.  There is a spacious inside pocket for a cell phone (my iPhone 6 plus fits!).  It is not waterproof, but the one time we did get caught in the rain, I stayed mostly dry inside the jacket (my core was dry, my arms were damp).  Overall super purchase.
B009D39X3K|1|Public incorrect items
B00CXADGQ0|5|I tried to install the lights in my sunvisor but they are too big. They will no go or snap in right. I need the right size to fit my vanity mirrors. 2014 Buick verano
B00K7VE2VK|5|I was skeptical at first about waterless car wash but this product changed it all. I bought Enthusiasts Only Waterless Carwash for my 1953 Buick Super Convertible. I am very careful about wat product I put on this classic beauty. First I tried a small area. The result was outstanding. Then I applied it to whole car to a beautiful clean and shiny finish. I applied the product also at chrome and windows of the car with the same fantastic result.
B00PU0MRZG|5|It fit perfect. really comes in use. The price was right.
B008PW52OY|5|excellent tool, definitely worth having
B00U85L98O|5|Ok
B00FALVU8A|5|One of the best waxes i have used.  Easy to apply easy to buff off.  Be sure to use the OG clay bar first then use the butter wax then use the Jet Seal.  Really good results.
B000EDQQCY|5|Works as it should!
B000VSY4HG|5|Great buys and received it very fast in the mail.  This is what we have been looking for and much cheaper than in the stores
B000MSU28U|5|Autoglym is very good on all black body parts
B0063CV8S2|5|Love this.  I have these on all my cars and cannot live without them.
B00075XCT4|5|This one did fit my 04 Jeep GC.
B00DHVN8MQ|5|Awesome product I was very impressed as to the definition of the symbols and lettering. And I love the fact that they provide a small paper explaining the reason for the bell. Overall I'm very impressed! Oh and they also provide a cool little cloth bag to keep the bell in!
B000CMHVEY|5|I ordered this wiring harnest for my Chev. Colorada pickup. It was simple to install , only tool a few minutes, and works fine. It was shipped without a delay.
B00009PGNS|5|Bought for my father to take in the road. It fits nicely in his truck and seems to serve it's purpose and works well.
B002G47GE6|1|bought for my 2006 vw jetta. they do not fit. amazon wants to charge me $7 to return them
B001B7TT3K|1|I started to instal this on my 2014 Dodge Ram 3500. Part of the installation process is you have to drill 6 selt tapping bolt into the side of your box. I completed the installation and the box would not close due to the tie down hook. I do not want to remove the factory hook. I spoke to a dealer and he stated the company has upgraded this product to properly fit. This old stock won't fit. My truck is now dammaged from the installation process and I now have 6 holes in the inside of my box.
B006G14FK8|4|the best
B0010GL0W0|5|Makes my '07 feel like a brand new car every time I use my turn signal.
B00GMNL36E|5|It didn't fit my Tahoe...but gave to my uncle and he loves the way it makes his truck look!
B002EFP3D8|5|It is definitely the Alliance Lion but it was slightly too big for me to apply it to my car.  I cannot fault the maker for it but I should have measured where I intended to put it.  Instead it went on my bow case which is cool too.<br /><br />Measure your area before purchasing!
B004PXB93A|5|It's an oil filter, what can you say.  It does the job!  Comes with a new drain plug washer which is nice.  I have these on my subscribe and save to get them delivered regularly for my 2014 Kia Sorento.
B00HEPL92W|4|These are 6k and my headlights are 5k and are much brighter. I use them when I leave for work at 3am.
B0066TLNT6|5|5 minute replacement with one tool and no draining of the reservoir. Works just fine.
B00HR26U0S|1|I did not like I ruined the day after having put bad product.
B0041RPGQ6|1|Straps didn't even last a week.
B00FRLHFSW|1|Seriously?, I buy local for 85.00 per case which is about 7.00 per qt. Amazon I tried but this is in no way competitive.
B001BW8DS2|2|wrong size
B0041TUA1A|5|Deliver was fast and product was easy to install
B00GR8KJN2|5|Done well and matches the color of my new car.
B00KHUQGGA|3|First off this stuff smells REALLY bad, like hard to breathe bad. It will make you car and hands stink for a few weeks. Either I am used to the smell or it went away. It's ok for the price. You get what you pay for. I like how padded it is.
B00COYNZJ8|2|Very cheap construction - flopped  down from the start, now is falling apart leaving a plastic mess in the car whenever you touch it.
B00LEBLI82|5|all of them worked as expected..
B0002Z9N1K|5|Perfect fit easily accomplished with great ordering instructions.  Product makes quite a difference on my truck.
B003SZUT6E|3|Grill just seem like its something I couldve made with some wire
B0044B30TO|5|What can you say. This is the manufacture's exact replacement part.
B0058OU904|4|Works great
B00B2PYZWG|5|Best disposable filter on the market!
B00BAZMHUU|4|I did not have to install new brake lines, however I did need to adjust my front brake lever to a slightly awkward angle.<br /><br />I could use another 1/2&#34; of bar rise to make the bike really comfortable, but it's good enough for me now. (I'm 5'10&#34;)<br />2005 FZ1
B00DSPEFZ0|5|Really nice made. Far better than givi rack. You have to buy givi mounting plate same as with givi rack. It's only on US amazon but it was only couple days to get it shipped to UK.
B00MK3OY6Q|5|Great decal! Went on easily and has lasted through an entire season plus! (Including drive-through car washes, extreme temps etc. Definitely worth getting if you are a big baseball family.
B007Y85GBY|5|It work just nice and came way before arrival time....I give 5 stars
B001P010T4|5|Installation was extremely difficult for my mechanic but they didn't stop until they were installed.  The end result is exactly the look and feel I expected.  No regrets and great price.
B00DU0DE00|5|fits fine , a little to heavy
B003UVCY00|5|So BRIGHT!!!
B004ME6CJI|1|The product has a somewhat broken sound when running
B0094BNRA6|5|great
B00029K022|4|Got it to add to my small trailer. It did add some help with adding a load, but not as much I was hoping for. I installed the rivet for medium load, but plan to change it and set it for heavy load. Hope it helps a bit more.
B010OAKRTE|4|Great decal, easy to apply. Quick delivery too!!
B001O074JU|5|Excellent product I am very satisfied
B0002NIKLQ|3|OK
B000ND0WB6|5|Exactly as described !!! Fast Shipping
B004OFNJZ0|1|not impressed. I would return them but they will make me pay over 6 dollars to return, so my refund would only be 3 dollars. Going to give away as a gift to someone who's car they will fit.  I recommend to get the JUMBO size for ANY vehicle, standard is more like a extra small
B00XVZYTLM|5|Replaced every bulb in my Motorhome with these.
B000JK2D06|5|gives a great shine, and still there after a few washes. Just used recently.
B00QW3XLVE|5|Is very good
B000TE46SY|5|excelente
B004YMRIC8|3|I thought these would be longer. They're OK but they don't really make my job much easier since I still have reach deep into my offset wheels.
B00XAX4B9A|5|These are huge, but still fit my small Neon. They are perfectly designed so that they easily fit around the rearview mirror in my car and truck. I have noticed huge differences in the hotness of my car since using this sunshade. I don't have A/C in my car, so every degree of temperature counts for me. These keep my car slightly cooler. But the most important change they've made is that I can touch my steering wheel now. Plus, it takes me only a couple of seconds to fold them up and put them away. I just slip them into their carrying case which fits in the very small dide pocket of my door. I received a sample of thos product for free so that I could test it and review it. I hope that these opinions help you during your shopping experience.
B00JTSYB6I|5|Perfect fit.
B00GUTBHRU|2|Shock works great, but had to shave half of the metalhead in order to fit on the post.
B000TV59EC|4|Worked as advertised
B003OB2MXU|2|Both of the bypass hose clamps of the hose clamps didn't even fit. Other than that it works fine.
B001PBQ07A|4|should work, well, strong, solid
B00TQZS10G|5|Very good frame for the money. Our cadet loved it
B00MS9A33K|5|Great quality product. Much higher then expected as seen in other brand kits. Works and looks great. Easy to install.
B000FW2MWW|5|I love these extensions.
B00A32WHS8|5|All Fleetguard filters are very dependable that I have used and purchased so far.
B00M0TLQ66|2|Was doing a project & waited a few hours for a fan grill to soak with surface rust. Ended up running out of patience & used a wire brush. The 2 hours it was soaking did nothing.
B005G3XFW6|5|Official looking.
B004500M8G|5|works like a dream, repaired head gasket leak. caravan still running great a year later.
B00BNX81CC|5|fitted perfectly
B0010TFBR2|4|Works fine; looks like it sat in warehouse awhile, since adhesives on bottom where all dried out.
B00T9SS53S|5|Excellent helmet...
B004I0FFC6|5|Well packed D O T  approved looks great rest  great deal
B00062ZQ06|1|Simple and easy to install, but it only covers half the radiator so your engine fan can’t operate as intended. Imagine using a straw that was cut in half vertically. Too much air can escape and it would be useless. Same concept here. Do yourself and your wallet a favor by finding a full circle fan shroud. Once installed, you should be able to hear air being sucked through your front grill into the radiator and subsequently the engine bay. Your engine will thank you.
B002GCKV0E|1|does not work in motorhome, always shows north unlessyou take it ouside  WORTHLESS !!!
B000BYGD2O|5|seems to be factory repl.
B000CK5QHA|5|Replaced factory front pads on 2012 crv with these. 2k miles in and no issues, performs noticeably better than the old ones.  I kept the old rotors since they looked ok.<br /><br />Used caliper grease on all the recommended application areas as specified on the box to prevent squeaking.<br /><br />These are graded a level above the standard pads for only a few bucks more.  I'm sure a mechanic would charge a premium for these.  Anything more would be overkill IMO. Go with these for your general and sometimes aggressive driving habits.
B00EHYMSEQ|1|Bought this for our shop & went to use it & the pump failed. Supplier wouldn't stand by the product or even any help with manufacturer.
B003SG7PU6|5|These seat covers were well worth buying. They fit very nice and are well made. The straps that attach to the bottom of the seat have a good buckle that allows you to snug it tightly into place.The head rest pieces are not as snug, but without ordering a custom set, And not paying the custom price, we are very pleased,
B00NBN1C78|5|All in one tire changing kit. I got this tire changing kit to put in a car that was recently purchased that did not come within a jack or tire tool. This kit comes in its own metal carry box that not only fits under most seats and all trunks but bolts to the tongue of most trailers. Most trailers come with a spare but not with a tire tool, this kit comes with a four way tire tool that fits most every lug. The four way tire tool is a feature of this kit that sets it apart from other kits, the tool folds down to fit nicely in the metal carry box. The jack is a standard scissor jack and performs like any other. This is a great all around kit for the car or for the trailer. I would use the four way from this kit before I use the standard tire tool that comes standard with other vehicles.
B00Y75QZD0|5|This product is great for long trips.  I travel a lot and I have a laptop, cell phone and GPS all that need to be charged.  Well this is perfect for me.  I got this for free for giving a review.  I an truly grateful.
B00CMHY0UA|5|The product I received was new and in good condition but due to the fact I needed the whole compressor I had to return it.
B00TJ29YG6|5|The sway bar stabilizers were heavier then the original ones and came with grease fittings, should out last the factory ones.
B002WVWXNW|1|The edges of the strap are sharp and dig into my neck. Not very comfortable to wear.
B00M78820I|5|This is a FABULOUS sun shade!  Covers every square inch of the windshield. Highly recommended and I would definitely buy another.
B00CUOLQUC|5|looks good, not installed yet
B0010G2MFY|5|Fit and work like new, happy to have them on hand so i do not have to worry about rounding them off.  Just pop in new ones and off you go
B00G2BINUK|5|Fits perfect keeps the car cool and protects the dash.
B00PVM6ZA6|5|This scale is sleek and impressive! It is very small but can weigh items up to 11 pounds.  I like the digital display on the front of it, you can change the way it weighs from grams to ounces or pounds to kilograms! It has a nice bright LCD display it does require 2 AAA batteries to run! It also has the feature of the precision tare that will subtract the weight of the bowl. It is so small you can fit in a drawer. I also love it because it is fits with my kitchen appliances good.<br /><br />this product was given to me for free in exchange for an unbiased review
B0042H6BA0|2|The straps left marks on my paint and I cannot get them off.
B00A82A4N8|5|The battery worked great.  It fixed my alarm system and I saved the money on a service call.  Would definitely buy again.
B00556L6RK|5|Thanks
B00842A7F4|5|works as expected, good quality
B002PUM6NM|5|good
B0033X8MQU|5|Very nice... just need to paint the rims black cuz u can see behind the covers to the silver steel rims haha
B00L9NIEQO|4|Sounds great shipped fast looks good and easy to install I reccomond this product to those with a 2.2L motor I put it on a 1993 honda accord lx
B00PBFZEXM|2|These are soo not plug and play I've got no interior lights now on my 2013 tundra the only two that worked slash plug and play were my license plate lights sooo frustrated right now!!!
B00PXD3N2G|1|Both units I bought blew upon being plugged in, one of them fried my phone. I would not trust this product again.
B00YE5Q132|4|[[VIDEOID:46a001a34f74674af2b83f378873f44d]] In this video I go over this neat portable jump starter, that is a heck of a lot more than just a jump starter. It's not perfect though, watch and find out why.<br /><br />By the way, it's already proved its usefulness to me. We had an outing yesterday, and my wife forgot to charge her cell phone. This little thing powered it for her, and charged it too! Needless to say she likes this thing now.<br /><br />Also, a disclaimer - the company gave me this product for free for a review. I do not review any product differently, regardless if I paid for it or not. They all receive the same level of scrutiny.
B000IYSKH8|4|It seems to be running well with plenty of cooling power but the fitment of the weird clip that Jeep uses could have been a little better. Maybe they should send a fan retaining with the units to assure good installation?
B00871CJ1W|1|Dont work for new Volex Wagens may be good for older models ,I have jetta 2015
B00407YQW2|3|almost math
B005NYDRAI|2|Made a little too short has large gaps on bed sides and tailgate rubs top of roll pan if you move it down then it hangs lower than bed sides and defeats the purpose.
B00KFQQBP2|5|That is what I want
B00O83OBQY|4|As described have had no trouble
B00361V162|3|This is a sturdy, heavy duty tool. Unfortunately the water heater element will not budge. Some engineer decided that water heater elements must have a nut with very little surface to grip. Oh well. I'll have to drill it out or plumb in a new water heater eventually if the other element fails.
B003T7XUE4|5|These Qwik Valve oil drains are fantastic.<br /><br />I've been using them for over thirty years on six different Saabs [from an '80 Saab 99 to several mid 1990's 9000 turbos], a Chrysler minivan, an E46 2003 BMW 330, a 2001 Chev Suburban and an '07 Hyundai Sonata.<br /><br />Some of the valid complaints are for people who may not have realized the clearance of their particular drain pan. It seems that most newer cars have a plug which drains laterally, from a side or the rear edge of the oil pan. For most of these applications, there will be no problems at all with the installation or function. On the '03 BMW 330, the angled nature of the oil pan meant I needed to install a spacer segment [Quik Valve part number ADP-109 [[ASIN:B0043QWWRG Fumoto Valve Adapter ADP-109 (12mm-1.5)]] so the valve itself could be installed correctly.<br /><br />On the 2001 Suburban [with a 5.3 liter V8], the threads on the oil drain required adding an extra gasket so the Qwik Valve would be oriented with it's release tab away from the ground. [see pics for right and wrong orientations; pix are from a '95 Saab 9000 Aero] If you prefer a longer, brass adapter for the Suburban, there is one available: [[ASIN:B0043QWVOK Fumoto Valve Adapter ADP-107 (12mm-1.75)]] The Quik Valve folks are aware of potential issues with low ground clearance, especially if you're off-roading or four wheeling, so they do sell a clip that provides an extra measure of 'lock' on the tab to keep it from pivoting open if you snag a branch, etc. The clip is part number LC-10,  [depicted here as a part of a kit: [[ASIN:B00QXQU122 Fumoto Oil Drain Valve Kit F106S (14mm-1.5)]] a small, black plastic locking clip which goes on top of the closed valve.<br /><br />Ok, in use, after it's installed: you will never want to ever go back to an ordinary 'wrench it off' oil drain plug again. You can get the engine up to operating temp [which allows a better, quicker, more thorough drain] without thinking of the hot oil splashing around your wrist, let alone juggling a very hot drain plug. You simply reach the small locking tab, pivot it up slightly, then rotate it toward the drain port [approx 90 degrees] and the oil will flow. On most applications, I use a short section of clear 3/8&#34; ID tubing to guide the oil into the catch pan. There's literally zero splashing, which also makes cleanup a breeze [no Speedy Dri! no sweeping! no cardboard!].<br /><br />For a few years, before the Fumoto company made a drain valve for the redesigned GM 5.3 liter V-8, I used a Fram version of the same idea: no tools required, it used a small recessed one way valve which was depressed by screwing on a special brass collar, attached to a short drain tube. It barely functioned, as the diameter of the drain hole was reduced so small [perhaps less than 1/8&#34;] the oil took forever to drain out, even when pretty hot. This is not a factor with the QuikValve fitting: when you rotate the tab, the brass and stainless steel sleeve pivots [looks like it's inside a nylon bushing] to open a good sized hole, approx 5/16&#34;.<br /><br />Makes oil changes easy, clean, and quick. You'll never want to go back. Buy one for each of your cars and you'll be set. [save the old drain plug only if you want to be cheap and re-install it when you sell the car OR to remind yourself of what a pain it used to be].ound your wrist, let alone juggling a very hot drain plug.

B0002F67ZK|5|Installed easily, works perfectly
B000C59LH6|5|Fit perfect! 20 minute install.
B004PX8BC2|5|Happy  with  purchase
B004DEBBPM|1|It wouldn't fit into my hitch at all.  It fits some vehicles but not others. The male portion is made of thin non-standard sized metal.  I had to go to Northern Tool to get the real deal made of thick steel that fit properly.  Don't do it.
B0073TCFQI|5|Came properly packaged, and new. Fit perfectly. No issues. Thanks!
B008KZJV3Y|5|Fit perfectly and were very easy to install.  Couldn't be happier.
B00VB2OJLW|1|too short
B00NI1KKK8|4|Great for the price,  easy to trim! My only complaint is that the rubber smell was a bit strong for a while,  but it went away after a week or so.
B000BXKYYI|2|Product looks ok, however, Prime delivery took forever.
B000PIMX5C|5|The item is comprised of two front floor mats. It fits my BMW X5 2002 perfectly. It looks very nice and the material seems durable and of good quality. The instructions on how to install the little anchors seemed useless but it was pretty easy to do after watching a you tube video. Overall I think it is a great buy, much better than the old stained carpets.
B00OW0NQGE|2|The metal keyring is large but strong, easy to get things on and off yet nothing falls off on it's own (yet).<br /><br />The leather strap seemed nice as well, but it came out of the metal part. I don't even hold it by that strap, I just stick the entire thing in my pocket.<br /><br />It looks like the screws on it are not designed very well and its breaking is inevitable, as seen my many of the reviews here.
B00GHTE2IO|5|Worked perfect and was half what other sites charged.  Thank you
B008Y69BYI|5|Fit 2003 Dodge Durango well
B0049ZLDN0|5|Brake shoes superior to OEM.
B0075ON740|5|Tight fit, but worked great.  Turned the unusable hand-me-down from the neighbor into hours of fun.
B00VN0FMMM|5|Love it smells great looks great
B0007WJRF0|5|As others have stated it fits square while the bed contours the cover is straight. That's not a horrible issue for me it still looks great. It seems to be very well made and functions great.
B000CPI6UY|4|Yep - I had to have this connection.  It is a true Reese at a much better price.  I looked locally (Elko Nevada) and did not find a single plug like this.  I have a K1500 Chevy and a Ford Truck bed trailer, and this did the ticket.  It works like a champ.  Although there were no actual comparisons locally, the prices generally on the other plugs were much more!
B00VNQLDQK|1|only one of the four lights worked the other three only half of the light work
B00DQD3PU0|5|These things are beefy! I bought them to replace my RE Superflex lower control arms so I could rebuild them, but I think I'm going to leave these Rough Country arms in place until they wear out! Super happy.
B00UNTU3VO|5|What a great car duster. I keep it in my new car and it easily cleans and shines my car!  The product came quickly, as promised. I am very happy with it.
B003HEXNLO|5|Great flag pole
B00K8BLM7G|5|Looks so good. I would definitely recommend this grill to anyone who wants to dress up there Arcadia . I'm very satisfied. . So easy to install. I think it took me two minutes.
B00V5QDJI8|5|Love it!
B00DJDYORU|3|One can was empty when I got it. So I used stop leak and one can. Works good enough.
B00CQ8ED84|5|Perfect
B00W31VMYC|2|Displeased, didn't work on my 2000 Dodge Ram or 2001 chevy Tahoe.
B00N4ESS1M|5|Works great!!! Fits perfectly in my truck.
B000CN95YC|5|nice
B000IOKWIS|5|Works great!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These little pods are amazing and bright as heck! Easy to install but it's doesn't come with a wire harness. Delivery was fast, four day for me. Overall a good buy for $20
B000O5DUP8|5|I was concerned about my new cargo carrier being visible.  This kit was extremely easy to install and worked perfectly.  All functions (turn signal, stop light, emergency blinking, etc.) worked very well.
B000TQ6P40|5|works fine
B00XZ9PJUO|4|It was perfect
B005GEJU88|5|As described
B00NRCX136|5|Worth every cent...
B00F0VMMSW|5|Worked for Saab 9 3.
B001EOV3JS|5|Easy to use, got the job done.  15 minutes to install.
B00BDBWRJW|4|easy install and work perfectly
B00YPPS0NA|3|The quality is good. Be aware the the red on pegs is a billet aluminum red & is different then anything painted red on a stock bike.
B004JBIGQ6|5|Direct replacement for 07 Hummer H3. No issues.
B000K03ULQ|5|Worked direct fit. You will need to get some 3/8 bolts from a local hardware store to put on. Very quiet. Works as expected.
B000CISD86|5|fits as advertised
B00N1YNJKU|5|Gd deal
B00BD5GVVI|3|Don't quite fit my 09 Jetta but they are really cute and I kept them on and deal with it.
B00AAI5C4Q|5|Item as described.  As good as OEM part removed.
B00BMJXZUA|5|OEM brand but half the price - OE parts suppliers are great
B00418U0AM|5|It's perfect!!!
B00ZB38A2Q|5|Great Product
B00PU49KC0|5|Just what I needed for my wedding ceremony as little gifts to who came.
B003YMVOL0|5|Warehouse damaged box delivers a rotor in perfect condition and saves a few dollars. It doesn't get much better than that.
B000CPA8DM|1|I thought it would be a clear with metal flakes but it just seems to be clear. Disappointed and I bought 3 cans!
B008BVZJQU|1|Product looks good, installation was fairly simple (the hard part was figuring out how to access the inside of the front grill on the Dodge Charger). The reason I'm only giving it 1 star is my son cannot make the lights stay steady on one color. He didn't want flashing lights. He has read and been told to just keep cycling through the patterns and eventually it will hit the steady state colors. After pushing the button that changes the flashing patterns about 300 times and getting nothing but flashing patterns, then trying a few random combinations of other buttons, he and I gave up. If someone can get me instructions that will actually work to get the lights to burn steady on one color, then I'll give the product 5 stars. Meantime, this was a waste of money because in our state, flashing lights of blue or red on a private passenger vehicle will get you a ticket and a day in court, or maybe worse.
B00936PB60|1|it wasnt what i thought
B00V89NFL8|5|Works great I would buy again
B00HLRAT92|5|Love this sticker, it get's lots of laughs
B001KOIRPU|1|I purchased a relocation kit, had it installed, and it leaks.  I called Baron but they would not answer any of my questions.  They passed me off to a motorcycle shop and they wanted to get paid for it.  It was leaking where the flexible hoses connecting the filter to the kit.  I purchsed new lines and it still leaked. The kit cost plenty and I was really disappointed that I could not get any help.  Don't buy this brand, cuz if it leaks they want you to pay more w/o helping you at all.  Really upset me, cuz I thought it was a good unit and expected some feedback, but I was wrong.  They'll sell it but not help you if it leaks.
B00KWLLB3M|5|Used it a few times so far do good. Like stock
B00FRHOJYE|4|Fits vehicle fine. Only issue is the bracket (comes with blade) that attaches the arm to the blade is much more noticible than the original equipment. But with the price of this vs the original equipment, I can live with it.
B00EJFH6YA|5|very pleased with the shipping and the light!
B004A6FBD6|5|Fits great on the passenger side. I recommend this if you plan on ditching the OEM ones. It's difficult finding an aftermarket wiper to fit the passenger side.<br /><br />Performance wise, I just installed them recently but wipes well for now, no streaking. Will update in 6 months.
B00LO3FPQ6|5|I mounted this into a stereo I built in a cooler to keep the battery charged. Does a great job, charges fast but stops when needed. It is a bit larger than I expected it to be, but that's my fault for not paying attention to the description. It is simple to use and very heavy duty. Haven't had any problems out of it so far. I had a smaller &#34;heavy duty&#34; 4 amp charger, but some water got into the stereo and it was toast. This seems to fit the bill for what I needed.
B00DK1MEWS|5|I really love this plate cover.  It looks exactly like the picture.  It is plastic,  but that's what I was expecting.  I've had it on my car for a few weeks now,  and so far I'm very pleased.
B008I6UE1I|5|Very nice cold air intake On my 2012 Subaru Legacy give great sound.
B00JMXQLYU|5|Perfect match. Easy to purchase. Free shipping was tremendous.
B007G7PV6I|5|good~
B00JXYFCA2|1|After having it professionally installed, the mechanic said that the compressor was not as strong as my original equipment compressor so it would not blow as cold when idle. It was installed exactly as directed. Overall,  I should have paid the extra money to have a better aftermarket compressor installed.
B00GUC00QG|5|Fit like a glove on my 2006 Trailblazer
B001TZBB3K|5|These are very good for windows and do not leave any streaks at all.
B009YFRJU6|3|Pretty comfortable, looks good and the installation is pretty straight forward. The one issue is that the pad height has to be adjusted with the seat on and getting access to the slotted screw is quite difficult. Takes a bit of time and some frustration to tighten. The screw should be a hex head or allen head to make this process easier.
B002PUROAM|3|Expensive but I guess that's to be expected for small volume replacement parts.  Fit right in the slot but the wiring was reversed don't know if it was the switch or if the original wrong was reversed. Not a problem I made the adjustment and it worked properly after that.
B00C6MVCBQ|5|its was a Really Good idea to order this kit, because I didn't know which bearing was bad,<br />inside of wheel there is two of them, so better to order this kit rather than wondering which bearing is making noise
B0000DYV3N|5|As described on AMAZON. It was easy to install. It gives a strong high frequency sound to perhaps keep deer and other animals off the cars path.
B004IBZS04|5|Came quick and was good deal
B0059QMF6C|5|very nice gift for the mini owner
B001KVW6EQ|5|Worked just as described.  Made life a lot easier on a plane.
B006R170LI|5|Great LEDs for the price, they worked, quick delivery, what more can be said.
B00U1LMPB0|5|Did everything it claimed, easy to use.
B00H24FZEI|5|I really like it and it looks good
B0001L0DFA|5|Finally!  A hose nozzle that works and lasts!
B009HU7GII|5|Ok
B00KTHY3F2|1|Two business days late, and it doesn't fit. I tried making it fit by cutting away some plastic- turns out the shell doesn't even go with the internals components.<br /><br />0/10, would not purchase again
B00NYBYD1Y|4|100% Goggles are the best I have used and the replacement lenses are great.  This no-fog smoked lens works as expected and is a great replacement to the mirrored finish that the goggles came with.  I don't know if I would recommend the mirror finish because it came off rather quickly.
B00BJ4BLMC|5|Ford quality great price... always get my filters here
B004TOB6EW|3|The tote works perfectly and is very convenient when camping! However the hose that came with it had several holes it which made the first time we drain the tank really gross! However Amazon did make this good and apologized! So a little advise always test your hose with clean water before using it to dump!
B00HVGG95Q|4|I replaced a worn out cushion from Kmart with this one. It is comfortable and does elevate me a couple of inches. My car does not  have height adjustable seats and I felt the driving position was a little too low. This cushion certainly solved that problem. At first I felt like a gargoyle perched on a ledge, but I'm getting used to it. I haven' t used it on a long drive yet, but anticipate it will improve the comfort of spending hours in the seat. It fits the contour of the seat quite well and stays put when I get in and out.
B00QQU6MKK|3|Owls were cute, but not quite of the quality I would have expected. Packages were attached together with packing tape and a label that rendered the original packaging useless for gift giving.  I put the owls in other packaging for use as favors at a bridal shower. Out of 16 owls ordered, 1 owl had an imperfection of an extra dot of on the front and one of the magnet on the back arrived cracked in half.
B00F9LPIAC|5|Awesome Battery!  Extremely light weight and powerful -- starts my KTM 450 XC without any difficulty.  It is smaller than the OEM battery, but it comes with pads of various sizes to obtain the correct fit in the battery box.  This battery is definitely worth the money you will not be disappointed.
B000KL1896|4|good exactly like description
B009408LLC|2|Useless. Will be good if had a handle for carry it. Also bottom need to be strong to keep bag's form. And the top should be closable. Quality of materials is good. Just need some must-have improvements.
B002UC8RN8|4|Its what I needed.
B00KWNULFO|5|Easy easy to install works great
B00N2CJYAK|1|I didn't come with instructions at all first off. Then when I found out how to put it on the 3m  tape adhesive didn't not hold on one of the sides that we'll and came off after I washed my car and got list in the car wash. So yeah not happy at all.
B005OVIMA0|5|Part fits perfectly, no leaks!
B000A8JNF0|5|Great kit.  Cleaner works great, and the Fabric Guard really does make the top waterproof.  I could say that it makes the top looks new, but my car is new, but it does make the top look great. You will want to cover your windshield and other window before applying it.  It is difficult to get off windows.
B00X9E0HRK|5|This is awesome, I finally have power in the Ranger and not 1 but two. Worked right away with no issues, hubby had it hooked up within minutes. Bought at a discount for an honest review.
B00K56PSI8|5|Love it! Looks like the picture and fits my Equinox perfect.
B002RPPIQC|4|LIke everyone else said, it is big.  Feels like it has a much larger profile than other half-shell/open-face helmets.  But with the visor down it looks a whole lot better.  Almost pretty cool (just how cool depends on how cool YOU are).  But the visor woks well and provides great vision, while blocking the wind hitting you directly in the eyes.  The lower back of the helmet provides more protection than other brain buckets, though it only fits down as far as the top of the ears.  If you're looking for ear coverage, get a 3/4 helmet.<br /><br />As for the fit, if you're right on the threshold between sizes, go for the larger one. I wear a 7 hat size, should have had plenty of room for the S, but am thinking I could have gone to the M.  Maybe as I 'break in' the helmet the fit will improve.  It's not too bad though, and still plenty comfortable already.  Liner looks like good quality, chin strap and fasteners are all solid, and it even came with the spare parts if you want/need to remove the visor.
B00Y7VOVPS|5|Awesome got here fast and perfect for my trailer
B00PGCDFH2|5|Ty
B006J35ZVQ|5|Great quality.
B00UYMRNOU|5|good deal
B00PMDG4O6|1|Very small, and they're black so they don't stick out at much on your windows. Low visibility.
B0068FU5U6|1|The only worst purchase ever made. Grips started to rust within two weeks! How do I get my money back. Avon should know not to mess with a person's bike.
B00S0JSQY0|5|5 Stars
B00KKYG230|5|The sticker was just as I expected. Good quality and easy to apply
B001EOV49C|5|Excellent, operation perfectly for 1998 GMC Sierra.
B003UM7B98|5|Great jack for the cost
B00JGJH8QU|5|Compact and works well
B008Y9K0OU|5|Good fit.
B00U83AZOA|1|I am sorry to say it did not fit my vehicle and kind of annoyed about it. I struggled for a half hour it would not no on at all I ended up throwing it away in the garbage very unsatisfied. Mr. Mammano
B00ULNYNZ4|1|What was pictured and description of product didn't match what I received at all!!!
B008GUTVMO|5|perfect!!!!!!
B000VL4ITM|4|It was within my expectations
B000JW7F48|5|WAS A PERFECT FIT
B0051UH656|4|I have only had this installed for a few weeks and my car is not a daily driver.  Pump is smaller and produces less noise than the Bosch 044 it replaced.  It is able to supply the required ~58 PSI of fuel pressure my car needs.  The electrical connections screw/bolts are smaller diameter so I had to use some washers to sandwich my cars existing electrical connectors under the nuts on the pump.  I bought some AN fittings for my fuel lines to adapted to the pump inlet and outlet.  Outside of this the kit comes with everything I needed.
B000CFGU98|5|Perfect fit. Arrived on time.  Thanks.
B00BJCHTFW|4|Larger than the crud at Walmart. Contoured very well.  Like them!
B00PNUIKDG|5|Fit perfectly and works great. It was pretty easy to install. Just watch videos online.
B000WKALOS|5|pipes are awesome...fit without any troubles at all  ,.....love them and the sound!
B001DBTV0U|5|Fit perfect and had all you need, even new lock ring, very happy!!
B000E7SY16|5|ME HAPPY
B00RTFCQRO|4|I wish the scent was a bit stronger and lasted a bit longer
B00JXYKJ5A|5|LOVE these things!  BRIGHT white and look MUCH better than the wimpy yellew from Chevy
B000CFS028|5|good
B0010E00T6|5|Super easy install.  Not sure if I'll buy this one every time since it was a little more than the basic air filter and I don't notice any &#34;fresher&#34; smell, but even if I do get this one again it's a bargain compared to what an oil change place will try to take you for.
B00I7EL1OU|5|Works as described. Thx
B0093AA1CK|5|Works well.
B0010E00T6|5|Easy installation, I replace it every 13 months.  No complaints.
B003MZQK04|4|Fits key well and keeps it somewhat protected.
B00BJOT9A8|5|I purchase this for a 2007 Toyota minivan with a head gasket leaking. I followed the direction and it has been 2 weeks since I added the Blue Devil head gasket sealer in the car.  So far so good. I am praying this was the fix because if not it is going to cost $3,500 to $4,500 for a head gasket job. The minivan is running well now.
B00ZGQ21CI|5|Does the job without costing me an arm like other name brands do. I like how these have the middle piece i between the rear mats. This part is often overlooked and gets extremely messy then it looks very odd when you remove your mats and your center piece is extremely dirty and the floor is not. Overall good purchase! :)
B000JFJLP6|5|Was very happy with the Jump pack! Was exactly what I wanted and the price you can't beat! We've had this jump pack before and it worked for a good 10 years so this time I bought 2, one for each truck!
B00AVQC01U|5|Now this is what I'm talking about!!! A REAL GAS CAN!!!<br />Wow what a difference from the ole Wal Mart/Menards can.<br />You gotta feel it to believe it!!!
B0045MDZ2Y|5|Installed easily looks great
B006X8AIXW|4|Looks great! Scratches pretty easily, and incredibly hard to install, but worth it once it was all finished
B00HUM9VI8|5|Fit my truck perfectly....high Quality....not a cheep product!
B005G6J3EM|5|Very pretty and easy to put on.
B00FA8XRIO|5|We purchased our new Mazda 3 one month ago. We are very satisfied with the Genuine Mazda all-weather floor mats. They are perfect fit, they're easy to clean and made of strong rubber to last longer than carpeted mats. In the winter, the snow will melt and flow into the ridges on the mat, as opposed to soaking into the carpeted area. We compared these to Weather Tech laser cut mats which are good but more expensive. We hope the mats will protect the carpeted area on the sides from winter salt, dirt and snow. We bought the Genuine Mazda cargo mat also and we're very satisfied.
B001GKVZAW|4|The mirror is very different than the original.
B009K2QX0U|4|Just what I need
B008IEV2XE|5|Perfect fit
B00BITJUUS|5|Perfect! Thx
B000F6DNMQ|2|This is great item but the part that this really misses is the fact that how can you fix this to the concrete floor. That is something very few people will have the power tools to drill in and fix this appropriately.<br /><br />They need to figure this piece out on the product front in my view. The whole point of this mat is that the car stops on this and it does not move. Since the screws cannot be drilled into the concrete floor that easily it kind of makes the product ineffective.
B0002AJR8E|4|This pump works very well. Note: Make sure all seals are in proper places.
B005IRN8U4|1|One of them was broken and I had to buy two more
B00KMLU8BS|4|It was great thank you soo much!!!!!!!
B000CMH58G|5|nice
B00JMLB4TY|5|Improves engine efficiency by minimizing friction, helps maintain lubricity during startup.
B00192JGN0|5|Working awesome
B0096569KU|5|Worked perfectly
B00767BA68|5|Works great
B001O0X9LC|5|Carrier holds bike secure without sway.
B000CJG06C|5|It fit perfect.
B007R69W9A|5|I hope this review is helpful in your shopping. I always appreciate it when people write things that help me make a shopping decision. This stuff is great. I live in a 40 year old house that has never had the windows replaced. I also live in a very alkaline part of Texas and have well water. It has so many minerals in it that the lime builds up on the windows from the lawn sprinklers. I plan to move in the next year or so and did not want to replace 35 windows. So I bought this stuff to polish them. I gently used it with an orbital automobile polisher. Wow is all I can say. First I polished the glass and it truly went from opaque to shiny. Then I masked it off and painted the trim. A friend came over and thought I had replaced all of them. They look brand new. So, while I do not know about every application, this powder was exactly what I needed to bring my house windows back to life.
B007MS9144|3|I ordered this for my sister. She says that it is just Ok. It does not hang from the window like the picture shows and it is easily pulled to point in the wrong direction. For the most part is accurate but if there a is a big truck or anything near by it messes the compass up, usually just throwing it North.
B004BWU8H8|5|This item is HEAVY. When I picked up the box from the delivery person I was shocked at the weight. Opened the box and found a very well crafted and well made lock box. The installation took me about 20 minutes. You will need a LARGE breaker bar to loosen the two bolts from the seat bracket. Once installed the item works as described. With the seat in its normal position, you cannot see the box under the seat. I feel comfortable storing items in the box I would not feel comfortable leaving just under the seat of hidden in the Jeep. If you need to leave your watch, phone, jewelry or other small items, this is the product you will want. I would not leave my firearm in the box. It would most likely be OK.... I'm just not one to trust even a lock box when it comes to some thief breaking into my jeep and figuring a way to pry open the box. Having said that it would take some work and more tools than most of these individuals carry.
B00VKT66CQ|5|fit great worked great...what more could I ask for
B000OAG2DK|5|Perfect fit! We installed it and it has great pressure. The shut of is solid and we have no leaks. Also the water stays warm during the shut off period! We are very happy with this product. :)
B00KGICIJM|5|Perfect match.  Works great.
B000FW7V50|2|Needs instructions on how much to use.
B005BNZGCS|5|Easy to order, fast delivery, power cord meets and/or exceeds the RV 's original cord.
B002DU3S9A|5|Bought for my tractor.  Did not work well.
B00196QK2G|5|Good fit
B002JH7PEQ|1|It stopped working after a short time.  I also had trouble keeping the plug in, it kept popping out.  It is probably cheaply made.
B005R5WGCS|5|Fantastic product, does exactly what it says it's going to do. How amazing is that!!
B00M9IAJQQ|4|Ok product slightly cools car seat
B00QLGKQAQ|5|I was very pleased with my light and the transaction with your co will buy again.
B00A6D8AI0|5|excellent
B004A30UHG|5|Worked and fit perfecto very satisfied would highly recommend
B005XRQ694|3|Bought these for my 98 SS and wasn't impressed with the quality or the fitment compared to the orginal ones. I recommend Lubing the nuts or using WD40 before adjusting them to fit; otherwise you can strip the bolts very easily. Even with a straight body the Gap between the lights and the bumper is easily over half an inch.
B000ZLSF74|4|works fine; but I should have read the description more closely; I thought it also had a built-in soap dispenser which is what I was really looking for...
B00NO14ZLC|5|OEM part - thank you
B00RJV03B4|2|The hook that goes around your headrest post is very flimsy and pulls loose with more than a 15 pound bag.The end caps holding the bag hooks on their post also come off easily causing the device to fall apart.
B00EEGAQDC|4|Great product and very quick shipping for it coming from China. However you do have to cut the bottom of the boot in order to fit properly. Which wasn't a big deal.
B00ECW2T38|5|works and looks great on my Subaru Forester
B004AFTDC2|5|as pictured on your web site
B003T1H7IA|5|Really works as advertised. Keeps my tools rust free in humid beach environment.  Leaving a tool out on the bench overnight reminds me of why I bought these.  Will buy more Zerust product to protect all my stuff.  Pricy, but worth it.
B0083HOY9U|5|Good quality and easy to put on. Can be easily removed if at first isn't positioned correctly or if any trapped air bubbles. Expensive but good value compared to lesser priced/lower quality comparisons.
B004AQU3NE|5|Works as advertised.
B00PKQGTM2|1|They roll this up so tight that when you unroll it the vinyl comes away from the backing.  It is not nice and smooth either and the cutter has a hard time with it.  Once I do get something cut out using the adhesive does not want to bond well with my car with or without rapid tac.
B0024NSS0A|5|My car looks new now.. really a great deal..
B008322O88|5|You cannot get anything better for $117. Good ahead with your purchase if you do not want to spend more than $120 on riding jacket which will be used once or twice a month on rides.
B00PZTY8XQ|5|This looks great on my 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium. Perfect fit.
B00H4GU8OQ|1|CRAP. Made of clay and wire. I did better with high temp rtv and cardboard!
B003ZIPV1W|4|Like the lights a little difficult to install if HD
B00LP93NAY|4|This work well for what I needed them for on my bike but had to buy a different brand because in Missouri it rain alot and these switch can not hold up to any moisture rain or heavy morning do so they are not for me
B00X5GESMM|5|This looks great. The picture shows a Subaru with a CVT but it was also a perfect fit for my 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium with manual transmission.
B000TYOQVQ|4|Exactly what I needed, I only needed one but whatever
B00D6H8AEW|5|Fob cover fits perfectly. Very snug & easy to put on.
B0016KFW06|5|Good
B00I4WZ2LI|5|Well made.  I also like the way it looks under the hood.
B000CGM1IG|5|Prefect fix for a 1999 Chevy S-10 ZR2!  I'd also recommend purchasing the Dormain 579-091 Fuel Pump Locking Ring kit because your locking ring will probably be all rusty and hard to work with.
B00SR2HRIQ|5|One thing about filters they are recurring expenses you will keep replacing them time and again.GOOFIT have present me with a cheap option when it comes to changing my filters.The quality is absolutely sublime i like GOOFIT products be it filters or any thing to do with spare parts for scooters.
B002E2WMWG|5|The shade is more towards an orange yellow. However, it looks really good at night.
B000BWAPH0|5|Worked very well. Had great difficulty getting the right gaskets for my exhaust system. All the energy spent looking for the right gaskets went into making exactly what I needed. pretty tough material! I used tin snips and hole punch to fabricate. First I made a paper template by firmly pressing the paper into the surfaces needing the gasket and then cut out the holes and the template from the blank paper. Then I traced the paper shape onto the gasket material with a sharpie pen. Worked like a charm. I have plenty left over for the next lime I need a gasket.
B00KYQPL8Q|5|Nice and bright white not bluish used for interior of my 05 ram.
B009Q6M1JW|5|Works excellent, same quality as the 3M version and about $10 less so no complaints there either.
B005FNKSMW|5|Great, cheap and it makes the mustang go really fast.
B005NLQAHS|1|Didnt Work in any of my Volkswagens
B00ODGHVMC|5|Excellant Transaction, item as described Quick delivery. Thank you
B00VQWK42A|5|bought this for my 2011 audi a5 coupe and couldnt be happier, easy to install and looks great! its a good purchase
B000CKTJZU|5|Works Good
B00KTITCRU|5|easy to program for a 2010 F250SD.
B0016GZQ60|5|This is amazing stuff !! Works great !  Why didn't I know about this before !!
B00J99774K|1|I can not give less than one  star. It was broken in 1 month, after buying.
B007AMAPG0|5|This thing was well packaged in a hermetically sealed bag and well protected by a box in a box.
B001FHZYBM|5|Perfect replacement of the old isolator bolts.  Once I replaced them with the new ones along with the intake clam shell gaskets, the Check engine light code P0171 and P0174 has been resolved.
B00ZV1E1U8|4|Did not come with the small metal key rings or directions for programming but youtube videos made it easy. Delivered very quickly and for the money it is worth it.
B000AMZK8U|5|Very happy about. I had a great experience
B000C5GAQQ|5|Works on my 1995 Dodge Caravan.
B00495UQT2|5|Ok for the price
B005BNP7SQ|2|It worked for about a week now I am starting to loose LED's part of it is lit and part of it is out.
B00RMD6NMW|1|No because it said it would fit my key and it didn't just didn't feel like sending it back
B00NQJ9QDE|5|This came at once and was just what I expected.  Thanks, friends.
B0038WSRN4|5|Quality gasket material for my project and very happy with  this product.
B001DKT0DO|2|Too small...would buy something else
B0002F66GA|5|Just what I ordered...my daughter loves it!
B00IZAKBGU|3|they dont fit very well i ordered xxl and they are very snug hands get numb maybe there not broken in yet
B005JUXCLK|5|I used this wrap for a motorcycle pannier project. I have a set of aluminum panniers that are were a little scratched and dinged up. I used this vinyl wrap and covered all four sides and lids. This product was excellent and very good quality. Arrived fast to my house.
B00D260J96|1|Didn't work
B004RH6G82|5|It fits perfectly! I love Motorcraft products. I wish Autozone had Motorcrate products for sale, they would make millions! 💰💰💰ツツツ
B004IVGA0G|5|I'm very pleased with the quality of this flagpole holder.  It fits the flagpole that I purchased from Harbor Freight. This combo is a nice way to fly my flags on my Motorhome while camping.
B007GMHTQ8|4|Great! Assembly fairly easy, but recommend you to have someone to help you out, as it will be a little difficult just one person as you need to force one side to put it together. Seems like very good quality and looks great on my SX4
B00O2K2YZI|1|It doesn't fit Oregon License plates, It covers parts of the date and year stickers and the holes don't line up properly. I really doubt if it would legally fit any state plate!
B00COYNZJ8|5|thanks!
B00XY6WL8Q|4|worked well but brackets needed to be modified because i had a 52 inch lightbar
B00BPJ0JG0|4|Right on the money.
B00KLCI91Y|5|Perfect item as described shipped very fast no issues will definitely use fowler again in the future.
B00QWGAJNE|5|Great quality vinyl sticker. As advertised, arrived on time.
B000CAVB3S|5|Baldwin and Wix are the two best brands out there.
B002ZS4QCS|3|Ok but smaller than expected.  Purse handles get stuck.  Better for hanging light bags in back seat.
B001G6HD8E|5|Direct fit for my 2006 325i BMW
B00838808A|5|works great
B0085IK9MI|5|Works great !!!!
B001IF3XW8|5|Really works well. Makes rhe truck look better
B002ZUUQWU|5|Awesome product
B004J869AE|1|Properly installed and cleaned the windshield however when I went to use the new blade it was skipping and not clearing the entire windshield. Not satisfied.
B00IO4EYMY|5|Great deal on R134a.  Note that oil is not included.
B000CQ4BZ2|5|EXCELLENT WIRE SET FOR THE MONEY!!
B005VO2E36|5|Perfect time. Not in a rush. May be expensive but it's worth it
B007TY4N9O|5|fit  /  works
B006EGAIII|5|Used them for my Honda Civic this weekend to change the oil. Worked great!
B009IF2LEQ|1|Returned. Was wrong part for my 05
B00ZGI840Y|5|Looks and fits exactly like the original.....
B0006IX87S|4|Definitely cleans and filters campground tap water.
B00JGU58U2|4|Can be hard to put on and even take 2 people to install. But front seats work well. Back seats are more suited for SUV or truck where you can get behind the back seat. Trimming the leather can make the seat fit more true to size but is not necessary. Back of seat sadly isn't leather but a thin mesh fabric. And headrest are not the greatest fit for some cars but can be cut & trimmed to fit.
B0049ZHBY0|5|Easy to install  works like new. Trick is removing the door panel. Once you have done that its under a half hour to put it back together
B000WEPI4M|2|too shallow and doesn't grip the cups well
B002E3FXB2|4|Got this installed over the weekend of the 4th. it took 3 people and a bit of wiggling. Don't know it if was an engineering problem, or a fit problem, or an our car problem, but it was about a millimeter off being an exact fit to our 2011 element. we got it to fit and to be stable though with some feats of strength and serious 'you hold that, I'll screw here'  cooperation, so all is well. Haven't towed with it yet, that's in two weeks, but it appears stable and is exactly what we needed.
B00E1SMA7I|5|Put these on my Accord 6 months ago. Perfect stopping on all 4 corners. Great carbon metallic power stop pads and the rotors are perfect. Highly recommend these for your honda!
B0002UHVAA|5|Works as it should!
B00Z8R2LQG|5|. This light is BRIGHT. It has been great! After reading reviews that moisture would get inside lens I just ran a bead of clear silicone around edges that took less than 60 seconds just to prevent that from happening.
B0008F68KS|4|ok
B00FB35RSG|4|Took a couple days to ship, overall satisfied with this sticker. Easy to install and looks clean. I didn't realize it only came with one sticker so I was kind of disappointed when expecting two.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Well built , very bright , would recommend to anyone!
B00UW4DNEO|3|I doubt it'll jump more than 3 times in a row.
B00R34S63O|5|Can not get 91 octane gas here in California. My GTI needs 93.  Car runs great with this product
B00T0WTYX8|1|wrong size back window, got the one for 1998-2002 dodge rams when i needed the 1994-1997 and came with a solid back window tint and needed the sliding back window and the tint is so thin that when you squeegee it it tears way to easily not happy with this crappy product at all
B000MUOPNG|3|Thanks
B007RW19YA|5|Identical to my original
B00MPX9RDQ|5|Makes every smile.. I've seen some similar but mine are Big enough to see far away but not my View.<br />If you want to make heads turn BUY THIS!!!!!!
B008OADK9G|5|Easy to use and understand. Installation can be done with the right equipment and you should have two people for safety. Please use multiple supports such as jack stands and wheel chocks also we attached the trailer to a vehicle for extra stability. Well built kit and rugged. Did a over to under axle swap. 2015 Coleman lantern LT travel trailer. Started out with 4 inches of clearance now I have 8-9&#34;.
B005N6WC16|2|Size large does not fit as a large
B002J858HQ|5|Chemical Guys AIR10216 Leather Scent far exceeded my expectations.  Where most spray scents mask odor and last a day or two, this product appeared to have neutralized the odor and it lasts on average about 7-10 days.  That is very impressive for a scent spray.  My interior is primarily alcantara and so I learned a trick from a car detailer.  Don't spray the interior itself; instead fold a microfiber towel and spray it liberally.  Place it under the seat and will last a good while.
B00OC90BR2|1|The rhinestones were glued on really crooked...
B000A835AY|5|Wow it really does clean and shine. The car inside looks spiffy!
B004H1WUDS|1|Signal not good
B000BQW5LK|4|Basic pump, not much to say except it works.
B004K9CTQ0|5|Looks great!
B00J5S5WD8|4|Direct bolt on for a 2014 Lancer ES. I installed it in 1 hour with basic tools on a lowered lancer with no jack lol. Would highly recommend a jack though. Sounds Great. My exhaust came with a nick and scratch on the burnt tip. It wouldn't have bothered me but its on the top center and clearly visible with it installed on the car, also it comes with generic bolts, would like to have been able to use my stock bolts. To use stock hardware you need 2 nuts with a different thread type. Love it otherwise. Its pretty quiet until you stop on the throttle, then it comes alive, which is what i wanted. Only other problem doesn't have anything to do with the seller and that is that the fedex guy just left it at my door and never obtained a signature from us or our neighbors or left a note even though it requires an indirect signature from someone at the address. no prof that it was even delivered, but i'm not the type of person to take advantage of that. Good exhaust though and definitely recommend it for the price.
B00B2AF5LQ|5|Nice, quality built brake hose.
B00280BGI0|5|Perfect Match for my existing Centering RIngs
B000BQWLE6|5|Great kittle trash can to hand from turn signal indicator
B00QSNZUNU|1|Broke after one day in the car. Sticky pad on the bottom fell off and the top half broke off. Too cheaply made. Do not buy this!
B00FSH0WM6|1|Update Dec 17, 2015 - Last 2 Gold Star LED's failed in past week. One lost 50% of LED's, then went black. Second one went black all at once (no flickering). These items are JUNK!!! Previous Review:  Wow.  My experience was nearly identical to the 1 star review given in July 2015. 3 bulbs failed withing 3 or 4 months of installation. I noticed they were slightly dimmer. Removed fixture lens. Sure enough, 4 to 5 of the individual LED's were not lighting. For me, the loss of light seemed minimal. So, I did not pursue issue. However, within a week or so these bulbs really started acting up. The light emitting diodes that had NOT previously gone blank/black were lighting and flickering at a high rate. Very annoying. Summary: Amazon support for product failure used to be excellent.  Not it deserves a 1*. Just like the failed bulbs.  Beware, Amazon support is now very poor.  Buyer beware. You may be getting junk, and be stuck with it.  Writing from a personal 'real (and recent) experience.'
B00SO9GYNQ|5|EXCELLENT
B000KYYMKK|5|Great product
B009DJMZ3E|5|Installed with no problem, works great!
B001F72Y5G|5|Works well for the price
B00HESPG9Q|5|Very sturdy
B00NI4ZH6C|1|They did not fit what they were supposed to
B00DSD4ILS|5|Adorable.
B003BZD03K|1|Started leaking during the first use.
B008OOP99G|5|I've been through a couple pair of the other TM road boot and these are definitely cooler boots.  These are now my favorite riding  boots.
B0016KA9PY|5|Worked as expected, although the wiring it up to our 2013 GMC Acadia took a little googling around.  But couldn't be beat for the price.  I paid over 100 dollars for our previous brake controller.
B00PUYDV98|5|Good!
B00LVV6ARE|5|Perfect fit
B0066SJYG6|5|Car fixed nuff said
B00D0JAAW6|5|Perfect fit, great sound, nice looks.
B0024ECCJW|5|Installed in a new heater but yet to be installed in RV.
B0089G0570|5|They are very bright give it a nice look for a low cost.
B009XVBTN4|1|Most needed parts were missing ( 2 round rubber  ) its a shame.
B000GKJKGE|4|Looks great easy install
B00K2G5I40|2|It is ok for the price. I live in the desert, our temperatures are way too high for this shade.. 100 + degrees, the heat shrunk the shade a little... But still works so I'm ok with it.
B002UC2Y3C|5|Cleans well and is mild on wax finishes.  My boat really shines!!
B0009V1WQQ|5|function and style... they are not lightweight.
B00VFCG3IA|5|Looks awesome.
B000VKTUD2|5|good for the price
B00AKWTJF0|1|When I got my items they were damaged and a part was even broke :-(
B00BL51H28|4|Might be a bit more expensive but it was everything I needed with no question weather or not I was installing the right parts and the right oil  into my KLR.650.
B002S9UYM0|5|Great item, You get what you see.
B00CM5863O|3|Works great until brush comes off.
B00VSHY28A|5|Excellent headlights.  Put on RV for better lighting on dark roads on trips.
B002FS4C0Y|5|Perfect fit for the vehicle... cant go wrong with Moog parts.
B000NPGXJO|5|We use this in my shop and add it to all engines with an oil leak as it saves us from having to clean motor prior to inspection for issues.
B00LOS782K|5|Exactly as described delivered on time
B0009I5WS8|5|good
B009NMLLV8|5|After owning my Toyota Sienna since purchased new in 1998 (yep, that's right--17 years and still going strong), a recent new tire purchase at a local big box store went awry when the installer did not properly attach one of my wheel covers and it disappeared during a freeway commute--found weeks later, crushed on the street below the bridge where it came off my vehicle. So I needed a new wheel cover, but I was concerned about getting the right one to fit my wheel and one that would match my other 3 original wheel covers. I found this one, a genuine Toyota cover, and the seller makes it easy to match to your vehicle with a make/model chart. The wheel cover was packed very well, arrived promptly, and fits my wheel perfectly! And the color and finish matches my other wheel covers, which was one of my concerns. Very happy!
B00PXLVS16|5|100% super
B00JSJMV38|3|Update, 11 months old now and the bottom is coming apart. See the attached photo.   Nice finish but too big for my 2013 Honda Civic. It claims to fit 13.5 to 14.5 inch wheels. The Civic is a 14 inch. This cover is loose. The next smaller size only goes up to 13.5 inch.
B00O99UR5G|4|Nice product, way easy!
B004AQZUX2|5|I was skeptical at first, just like many of the other reviewers had noted they were, but after seeing some pictures from one customer I thought I'd give it a try. I received my items quick and they were exactly what I was expecting and fit my vehicle perfectly. So far they've worked great and I look forward to them working for many more hours to come. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone else inquiring because for it being the right product, you absolutely cannot beat the price.
B006G52A7O|3|Voltage reading is 0,6 Volts too high...not too accurate!
B00A6AS6LY|5|Used this funnel on my daughter's civic and my S10. It is nice for filling the radiator and eliminating air. The caps worked well in both vehicles. Came as illustrated with all of the parts.
B00LHB08C6|5|These are so cute! Look amazing in my car. Very very pleased.
B0043029XY|5|its a towel. It picks up water, buy it....
B00U2AZ12K|2|It does not work correctly.<br />Usually indicates communication error or failed communication, rarely it indicates the failure of the vehicle.
B005GYAKVO|4|Excellent
B003QQ06XG|5|got it earlier than expected.put it in,cranked over perfectly.couldnt be more pleased.
B004XONW54|4|Harness came neatly packaged and had a straight forward instruction sheet and wiring diagram. I didn’t use all the connectors that came with the kit and opted for better supplies I had laying around. Go above and beyond by soldering and heat shrinking the connections. The only thing I didn’t like was having to extend the wires that lead to the temp switch. They don’t give you more than a few feet to start with. To hide wires, you need much more.
B00LPIA3T4|5|Very handy
B00L9NHV4K|4|After a few modifications it works great...
B005HF7GS2|1|Design looks great but the decal would not separate from paper and adhere to window.  I bought 2 but could not get either to work.  I followed the directions included and<br />I've put on a lot of these types of decals before so this was not simple ignorance on how to apply.
B009V06W98|5|Love it and so does our 8lb dog last weekend  a couple stopped us asked us where we got it .They  order one on the spot for their dog.
B00S0SSCQ8|5|Good lights
B001U8MPMM|3|Thee were bought for a friend who decided to NOT keep them as soon as they were shipped.  I sent them back.
B00VTT8NY6|5|I received this in a mystery box from the Adams website. It's now my new favorite product to use. You won't be disappointed with the shiney wet look it gives your finish as well and a sealant protection that water beads right off of. Buy this stuff you won't be sorry.
B00FWND5KM|5|Good
B000C9SRD6|5|Very easy to install and works great.
B000C0WPRY|5|Had no problems with this item.
B00OGWZ01W|5|Easy install, great price, awesome upgrade look, and affordable.
B00DB8J5XG|5|It fit perfectly
B002A6LZ38|5|You need this! It is a fantastic tool for troubleshooting systems.
B00OBB41QS|5|They work great. We bought more after trying these.
B00J5CVMLU|5|I use it if there is just a little dust but very little on my Yellow Corvette, all over the body, and use it all the time on my chrome wheels. Good product, takes care of lots of little stains, like mud splash, little tree sap drops, finger prints and more...<br />I have been using it since 3 months.<br />I recommend it.
B0002SRCMO|5|I use this all the time now that I own it.
B00EKEGRVS|5|love it
B0120LF844|5|Applied well to my cleaned windshield. I highly recommend going slow and taking the time to use a credit card to go over the decal before removing the plastic for fi all application. Especially take your time around the small lettering. I spent about 5 minutes going over it and it has no bubbles whatsoever.
B000CF8W1W|5|Very easy to install! Look and work on my Tacoma
B000GU5IH4|5|i have had the cover for over a year and it has held up very well. its been through a few texas storms and the only damage is from putting the cover on while the exhaust was still very hot...couple of small burn holes.
B0089RXEVS|5|Filter worked perfectly and boy was my previous one nasty. Literally was completely black. It was a pain in the a$$ to change but that is ford's fault. Good filter my AC smells much much better now.
B000C2AL7I|5|Very nice gasket set. For the rubber sections at the front and rear of the block, I only put a little Ultra  Blue RTV at the ends of the blue rubber sections.  I used Ultra Blue for the manifold to head seating surface the for the upper to lower manifold seating surface. Very high quality.
B008G328BW|5|The mirrors are great and fast shipping. Would order from this seller again.  Tobin  AutoandArt
B007WMGMC4|5|Installed parts on my 2006 325i BMW.suspension feels better than when it ws new.
B00L4LFXYC|5|Perfect fit!
B000IZ12HC|5|Replaced the original leaking hose on my 2001 Durango. Works great no leaks, fit perfectly. The install wasn't as bad as it looked.
B00OGDO9NQ|5|Just Great--
B00NSTSQRE|5|I have a friend whose daughter has just turned 15 and a half, and you'd think the world has ended every time she has to turn the car off. The problem is she's a lot better driver in her own mind than she is behind the wheel. It's not that she's horrible, she just hasn't developed the skills to be a good driver yet. And that's where this flexible &#34;new driver&#34; magnet comes in. It lets everyone know that her skills haven't yet developed to the point that they can ignore her when she's driving near them. It's good for her safety and for theirs as well. As soon as we put this on her car, we noticed other drivers giving her plenty of room.<br /><br />I received this magnet at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
B000BQSIWK|5|Use it for my trolling boat motor battery, works great
B0058WXNOK|4|This is a really good product the only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is because of the finishing step heating the iron and blending the colors together didn't work well but it did cover the hole and looks much better than a torn seat.
B0022XMKK6|1|Arrived in opened box and was returned for a refund.
B007Q1CNFQ|5|Fixed my problem; ABS and traction control lights went out after installing.
B00H27JMEE|5|I only used the GT part.  Don't know why Hyundai chose not to put GT on that model, but this product fit perfectly and looks like it came from the factory that way!
B001DCF6LW|1|absolutely useless. returned the first set thinking they might actually be able to replace them with a functional product as the ones they initially sent failed to hold the hood up in any meaningful way at all. they more or less slowed the slamming slightly. second set is only marginally better. absolutely unable to support the saab 9-3 hood they claim to able to be used on. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|After having put two pairs of lights like these on my 4x4 I decided my bike could use a pair. I admit that they look better on the 4x4 but the light can not be beat. It is a clean white light that really lights up the road at night. A real plus is that two of these lights (12 LEDs!) draws less wattage than just one regular headlight bulb but gives off at least twice the light.<br /> Absolutely great lights! Highly recommended.
B003SJNOJE|5|This beats buying OEM. These sensors setup in minutes, automatically!!!<br />I was about to spend 4 times the amount, I am so glad i gave it a try.
B00192JGY4|4|Works as advertised; have wanted/needed one for a while.
B00CPSXPUW|5|came fast and looks nice.
B00CWXGJCQ|1|Pads were to long. I had to modify them to get them to work.
B00BPDB5NM|5|Very pleased. Quality item. Fast shipping. Thanks!
B003VAWYRS|4|This thing worked like a charm for our very 1st camping trip.  It's light and easy to use.  Really like the small profile.
B0001XPC7C|1|Too small to be useful.  Not enough capacity.  Very sorry I bought this.
B00B9FE5BA|5|good deal
B000BZ968Q|5|these fit perfect on my ford f-350 2002 they come whit the abs wire 2
B00F3I93UM|5|Awesome bulbs
B00MG687JW|1|If you're looking to start a 12hp gas engine then this may be ok, but I used it to start a 30hp diesel engine and every function stopped working, even the on/off slider switch. I turned it to the off position and then put it down and it sparked. It doesn't actually work for small diesel engines as promised... Junk
B000WJ5HA2|2|Cover quality was fair. Problem was it said it specifically fit my bike. It wasn't even close. It was way too small. Had to send it back. Be sure about the correct size before you order!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent product, does everything it's supposed to. Buying another one..
B00DL6T2YK|3|OK
B005CRE2K0|2|Bought these for my car in January and it hasn't even been 6 months and the drivers side seat is ripped.  .
B004MXN71U|5|I am I've done a timely fashion and work great I recommend using Amazon per all your purchases
B00RK770EA|4|UPDATE: I spoke with the seller and they sent me a different net, which fit my ML 350 much better.  It is still a little loose in the bottom, but over all, I think it will work ok for light objects for sure, One thing different about this net and the actual Mercedes nets is that these nets don't have a cloth straps to reinforce the top and bottom or the sides of the net.  Other than that minor difference, this neet does seem to fit well and I'm just happy to get the net that fits!<br /><br />.
B000IYSL0E|5|Straight forward swap. Great unit got my AC back with minimal work. 30mins.
B0068Q5C1M|5|Very well mad I will buy them again any easy to put on
B0012Q4IPY|5|Had both plugs and wires changed in my 1997 Lexus LS400 - getting two more MPG!!
B000C8WM9W|1|these are the worst bulbs I have ever owned. I have seen candles on a cake put out more light then these. Waste of money do not buy. The one star is for quick shipping.
B000Q08RLI|4|So far so good. It fits my 2008 Prius perfectly. If you google how to put it on, you will find it is a simple job. It took me 15 minutes and I saved $75 versus the dealer.
B002SB03IS|5|I had high expectations because Toyota isn't going to put their name on &#34;crap&#34;. I was not disappointed either. The fit is perfect for the Tacoma Long Bed. The material is thick and should easily last the life of the truck. Nothing slides around on it and it really dresses up the truck bed. The price too was amazing as it retails here for nearly double what I paid. I'm very happy with the mat.
B0007M30BW|5|Well made and exactly as described. Arrived quickly.
B00FSH0WM6|5|Meets and exceeds expectations.  Replaced conventional bulb, in two bulb fixture with this and higher output  8305, so have a low light or nice and bright.  If you are considering these for an RV, don't hesitate, you be glad you did it.
B00IOAHL8M|5|Outstanding product and well made. Added rear shocks 24&#34; recommended even though factory would have worked but would be at their maximum range. Keep the original front shocks.
B00IY20J02|4|Perfect replacement for OEM.  Would be 5 stars if it came with screws and washers.
B0007LL0CO|5|Worked perfectly
B00P9R8O02|1|Strap is too short to go around my seat.  The product looks nice and flat in the picture but, in reality, comes wadded up and is not likely to lay flat.
B0096725GA|5|Soo good I bought 6 more.
B000BYGEWS|5|Product arrived 1 day ahead of time...no problems...5 stars all the way!!!
B00LG07MZE|5|Fits my 2013 Escape perfectly.
B002P8RAM6|5|Showed up super fast.  So easy to install,  wish I didn't Wait so long to purchase. .
B00KQWMH2G|5|The best stuff since sliced bread. It's pricey but well worth it!
B006UKGBLQ|5|Fits and works as described.
B000EDOTAK|5|Great quality, Although I would not bolt it down, use heavy duty 3M 10 pound Velcro.
B00068XCQU|5|Very good charger. I have several. This is the best charger for AGM batteries.
B0081SQY1W|5|These work really well to protect the handicap Placard.  It was a replacement for one that was damaged.
B00E8CV0EQ|5|Just as expected
B00T8SWG8E|4|Put these in last weekend.  The look is much better than the stock bulbs. I have 2 issues though. The fit into the existing enclosure doesn't seem solid.  I had to really force them in to get them to seat. Maybe it a dodge design. Other issue is that now they will not light up if I have my high beams in auto. Take them off auto and they work fine.  Not sure where the issue is but its not a deal killer.
B00DU0NI7Y|3|I bought this for my niece, she loved it, the only thing is, we couldn't fit the back covers to her back seats...She is rocking the zebra print!
B000BUOSGG|5|Just what we needed
B001C1GWTY|4|It was not a direct fit, I had to shave down the edge first to make it work.  Looks good once modified.
B00JGJGFQY|5|great quality
B00GJMXTD8|5|Best I can say is you get a great price and quick delivery. Marine grease is marine grease, if you get my meaning.
B001W9OP86|3|The 2 front seat covers fit my 2000 jeep wrangler pretty well. And being cloth/fabric they don't get as hot as vinyl. The back seat cover was way too big for my jeep. I put it on the back seat of my Tundra and it fit OK.
B00Z0KQB8K|5|Very good,Fit great.
B00WNQGYHC|5|Used these to replace HID kits on my bmw 335.  Pretty bright, but not as bright as the HID kits.  Very comparable though.  Wishing these would last longer since they are LEDs.  HID kits are great but the ignitors/resistors never seem too last very long.
B0010E1LYY|5|Great substitute for Camry OEM part and much, much cheaper.  With receipt you can even save more with a coupon from the company.
B00QJMN5FK|1|0% V bad
B002PQW4TC|5|Perfect fit, good quality aftermarket lamp assemblies.
B001RBCU90|5|Came out absolutely beautiful on my mirror and on my car, would definitely buy another one again.
B00PV6TFG8|5|Super  Very good come to fast
B008CE06ZA|5|love this towing hitch
B00FZQ0OZA|3|This pump works just fine however there are a few things buyers need to be aware of.<br /><br />1) The male end for the power receptor has 3 raised points to make sure it aligns properly. Problem is that the make of the Toyota only has 2 points for alignment. It was easy enough to trim the extra point off but I'm sure it voids the warranty immediately. It did work fine when connected.<br /><br />2) There is a 0.5 - 0.75 second delay before fluid sprays from the nozzles to the wind shield. The pump is definitely less powerful then the original but works just fine spraying the entire glass.<br /><br />Because of the price, I recommend this pump. Just be aware of the 3 points of alignment and the need to trim one (at least for a 2008 Toyota 4-Runner SR5).
B009FUF6DM|5|really good quality
B00GJ1CMTQ|4|I didn't think that this would look good next to all of my other wheels with the center caps that have the chevy logo....but I hardly noticed at all. Way better than no center cap at all! Save yourself $30 and buy these, then go buy a small Chevy decal and put it on yourself...you'll never notice
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Perfect fit. Item is as described. Shipped quickly and is very sturdy and durable product. Just remember to not leave it.
B004LL9MPI|4|Fit pretty well on my 2014 1ss had to make a few  adjustments but crazy
B008ECDF8A|5|as same as the original
B00WJ05RPM|5|Worked great and fit well
B00S5O3DIY|5|Great product - used it on my pantry door looks great and plenty left for other projects
B00GZKC6EW|5|Excellent oil at a very reasonable price.
B0023VDOZ2|4|good price for this replacment part; fit perfect; arrived as expected
B002P3LLSU|5|These are exactly what the description says. Haven't fogged up on me and fit very well. Also lenses come out easy for replacing but will not fall out when using. Good item.
B0018YGOCA|5|my housband sais is the best
B00KFQ28P4|2|Fairly easy to install, even without any instructions. (It took 2 of us about 40 minutes to do front and back seats) They fit my Honda Civic decently (a bit loose in spots but they are universal fit and a few safety pins fixed it) and they look really nice.  However, they have only been on about 3 weeks and there is already a huge hole ripped in the driver's side cover. Nothing caught on it--it just couldn't take the stress of use.
B004GCT4YG|5|Keep in mind this does not have any wiring for in car adjustment or mirror heating.
B004C6M5BU|5|Great fork bag. Holds some tools and looks great!
B001AV545Y|5|Yes luved it.
B000JZ8X32|4|Worked as described. Stickers all over it that said made in china so if you think its an American part its not.
B004942LSM|4|Good quality piece and good price also, replaced mine , but what i see now my temp. gauge runs 1/2 or more, according this a oe replacement but not sure if it is going to affect my motor in the future, here in California most of the year is hot.
B00CJFQD5U|4|After figuring out how to tighten then up from wobbling around. They work excellent. There is a nut on bottom of mirrors the instruction paper with mirrors does not even mention them. Very easy to install would recommend then to anyone. I have these installed on a 2015 Can Am Commander . If instructions were clearer it would have been 5 stars
B00852QTIC|2|There is a problem with one of the wheels/tires. I have replaced the inner tube 4 times and it has sprung a leak each time. Not sure if the wheel or the tire has a defect that causes this problem.
B0089LT5ZS|5|Great filter, high quality
B00THH9I7I|5|Works well and ergonomically easy to handle.
B00FT2QNHI|2|There are not enough letters in the package
B006BDGDXI|1|Bought these and just now getting around to getting them programed and find out from two different places they are defective :( needless to say I am out my money.
B005IZ1PH4|1|This is not what I was looking for.
B00IDDEGHE|5|hi the stud who are breaking with spacer I want to thank you for another stud
B00KTHUXKQ|5|Great replacment for the broken OEM fob. Be careful replacing the buttons and internal components into the new cover.
B002BEC1NC|5|Beautiful helmet, protects well, the quality is excellent ... I recommend it.
B000CO9186|5|I needed 2 as the previous owner cut the old ones. It took less than 5 minutes to remove the old ones and replace them with the new ones. The dealership wanted a lot more for just one than I paid for two. The box was about 8 time's bigger than need be but I'm not going to complain about that. These are the exact one's the dealer had on the shelf.
B002UC1ALE|5|Great replacement hose for the outdoor shower.
B005Z8HAUK|4|It works well,  I just wish it stayed cooler longer
B0009YID8I|5|Oem. Exactly  as described. Arrived fast!
B001MOVK9S|5|Everything is going great
B00XB59HT6|5|Very cool
B00F50T8GM|5|it works, i don't know how lights would perform without it
B007KPWU8I|5|This was purchased as a birthday present for my brother -- it was quick to install and looked great on his bike
B003ZOF09Y|5|Very pleased. Haven't used much yet.
B000C1F8UE|5|Used in a 2004 Cadillac De Ville. This was a replacement for another manufacturer that had issues reading the fuel level along with reporting the gas cap was off.<br /><br />This unit dropped in perfectly and worked as OEM.
B005ZYAB2S|5|Great replacement!
B0026N91PE|5|Works great
B00CMNY2M0|3|just put them on they squeal a lot on just rolling towards at low speed stop but other then that their okay for the price. might have to break them in first.
B0046BFWUW|4|The design and build is good, but it needed to be a little tighter around the wheel...
B00I7ELSSY|5|Since i installed the air filter the air inside cabin its  much more pure good product i recommend for everyone, good price
B000I1IWVA|5|This is what I needed for my project and it is high quality.
B004AIJUF4|3|All went well.
B001A1FO6I|5|Fit 97 tercel perfectly
B001QVFD4K|3|Great product. Easy to apply and gives a good shine, but TOO  EXPENSIVE for such small bottle.
B00DSD68N4|5|Good quality and size. Kids love it!
B0002VFE30|5|Perfect for the cargo trailer!
B00K6PIE1G|5|Love it
B000FW2NEY|5|Love it!
B0075FG1JW|4|Works as I would expect the Husky Liners to work on my Tacoma - a proven product.<br /><br />-1 start because there is a little carpet exposed along the side of the transmission housing near the accelerator pedal.  The liner could have come up a little higher along this side to protect the carpet.
B00AETON9G|5|Perfect
B008YJAIWO|5|Great buy at a third of the price from Mopar. Nearly identical to the the OEM. Lift sockets fit perfectly into the housing and the replacement took less than 5 minutes. Plus I received the part quickly.
B00B2QFIVC|2|each seat cover is two pieces so it doesn't stay on the seats. the steering cover is very loose fitting so it slides when you turn the wheel, and that is dangerous.
B0082365AQ|5|This thing is awesome for the price. If you have a tri bow fishing yak, it can be challenging to get it centered. Smell goes away after a while.
B000F5ED12|5|Thank you
B00FBXXSWS|4|very good Products
B00BRL73Z6|5|Ad advertised  OEM floor mats by Toyota.  A little darker shade of gray, but actually look nicer than the previous lighter gray mats I had before, which were OEM as well, but came with the car new.
B00II5YADC|4|Excellent
B0037N9WMO|5|They are soft as mentioned and they look great. price was inexpensive and  delivery was quick.
B001B9SL50|5|Great price, arrived on time, perfect fit, and work great!  I would definitely buy again when needed.
B002P35N7A|3|Looks better then old on
B00DHVKV4Y|5|Great
B000A8OK6W|5|Fit just like they should and look great..
B00BEZIAPC|5|Fits good
B00746N6XG|5|👍🏻
B000BRKYIA|1|this product said it would fit my 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan. it did not however because there was no option to put in the sport submodel
B00030BF88|5|Best I have ever used to combat rust.
B0009IQZPW|5|Use these to wax my car on a monthly basis.  They work well and can be cleaned and reused.  They also work well to apply clear bra wax.
B00VEWI38O|5|All went well
B000BRGAJ2|5|good product good price.
B0096E5FC4|5|It does the job and it is what it is.
B004K0RVKI|1|This coil does not hold up under high RPMs. Upon acceleration the engine bogs down and sputters under the increased load.
B004I0H86C|5|It fits my car. looks very nice.
B000EDSSDE|5|Works great
B00DVS5LK2|5|Part fit perfectly and was easy to install.  Comes with a lot of extra hardware too.
B00JVHLS3G|1|The white parts of the emblem have turned yellow after having it on my car for a month. It looks awful, so Im now having to order an OEM one. Do yourself a favor and get an original BMW emblem the first time.
B00JM5BEUE|5|These are the best lights ever! I'm very happy/impressed by them and they get alot of attention! Great job!
B00A14QREI|5|Exact replacement for my 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited (5.4L 3v v8)<br />My external temperature reading was off by about 10-15 degrees and replacing this part fixed it.<br /><br />I originally tried to clean the original sensor, but it did not fix the problem.<br />It is important that this sensor is reading the correct temperature because it works with your ECU and your climate control feature in your car. It's not just a thermostat/thermometer. Replacing this part made my A/C unit work better in Auto mode.
B00062ZQAG|5|awesome, tight fit around 1/4 plastic tube.
B0034ND4CG|5|Excellent value. I've seen complaints about &#34;mushroom head&#34;. Make sure you buy a helmet that fits around your head..not on top of it. Get the right sizean d you'll love this helmet!!!
B001G7EHGY|5|This part is the perfect fit. Its easy to buy the wrong one...This is the smaller of two ring seals that fit on the lower end of black plastic U shaped tube that goes from the air filter housing, to the front of the turbo charger. Grease it up before installing because it is a very tight fit.
B001HATY36|5|Perfect for the camper while it is in storage.
B00T2XJ39K|5|Warning...The Tornador is addicting!  I bought this the clean the carpet in my pickup from multiple kid spills and rotten watermelon explosion.  Needless to say, it works wonders.  I ended up cleaning my truck from head to toe.  My only complaint is a lack of operational instructions for a no professional dummies like me.  I have no idea what dilution ratios to put in this thing nor what soaps can be purchased at a local retailer.  I emailed the manufacture and got no response.  Also you need to add a swivel adapter for the air hose or you can't set it down without spilling.  I love this product and you will too!
B00N6QGQWG|5|Sweet
B009EUCAYG|5|This was of high quality and looks just like the picture. Especially considering the price.
B005CLP35E|5|thank you
B00JMD4NUO|4|Good modular helmet, blue tooth controls takes some getting used to but it worked against phone and rider to rider against a blinc m2 model.
B004GCF4D6|3|cant tell which one was replaced! very happy! thanks
B00N675IZQ|4|Some of the cuts are not straight. You have to look close, but I noticed it while installing them. They are a nice fit in the vehicle and look great from a distance. Getting up close you can see the wavy cuts.
B000CCFIJ4|5|Just as it should've been
B00HHJLCU4|4|Great light but stock bulb is very dim.
B00JF5LRN0|5|I shopped around, compared several. Was not the cheapest but was obviously better built than most. Amazon had best price.  Glad I bought it. The raised offset on the mount keeps it from dragging so much on inclines or entrances.  Have loaded it pretty heavily, no problems.
B007KPWQBE|1|.. the item looks ok but seems lose when installed  ..  should fit much tighter so I am not using it  ..  there ya go  ..
B000CSINYK|5|thanks
B0002L683A|5|👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
B009V14I7U|5|Good fit and value! Originally odered this with muffler delete but thought otherwisw after placing order. Ordered Diamond Eye SS muffler to compliment this stystem. Muffler is straight through design and really mellows out the exhaust note. It's still loud but not obnoxious to the piont you can't hear yourself think! I removed the &#34;beehive&#34; as This is a turbo back system and I don't have to submit my truck to state inspection. Opened my truck up and let it breathe!
B003N27636|5|I had the older version and the new version works even very well. You will have an idea about the state of your BMW before taking a long trip. So, you can address any issue and prevent problems. Also, it will reset an assortment of indicator lights. I would not be without this tool.
B002S70H9M|5|It met my expectations.  DuroMax recommended it.  I read the reviews about having to place it on the tray backwards so I expected that and installed it easily. It started right up once in was in place.
B00T0TZSPE|5|Cute!  Easy to place!
B00515NGVY|5|My truck runs a lot better now that i changed my plugs!
B0000WZLPM|5|Best device I have ever seen for helping you secure your cargo in the truck bed.
B000CFGSRM|5|Love love love... Would buy over and over again.  Super cute and awesome!
B00BFU2CPK|5|Works perfectly as designed.
B00ESLBQXM|1|The button did not work. Even took it to a shop and they told me the box was defective.
B00M2QMHK6|1|The adjuster lasted about a week
B000AXHPRS|4|did exactly as I expected
B001MXL71A|5|Great device. It worked right out the box . I pumped up my sedan in quick speed . I hope to use and have it for a very long time.The only downside is i had to use my digital tire gauge to check tire pressure.The gauge on machine is only good for making sure pressure is building up and holding ,and that was not a problem for me.
B004K8V6XS|5|Perfect product.  My 2008 expedition blower got stuck on high, the dash and wheel buttons made the indicator go down but the fan stayed on high.  Better than staying off I suppose but still a pain.  After much googling I found out this is a common problem on expeditions and F150s and it's an easy fix.  Squeeze the two sides of the glove box so it folds straight down and you'll see this on the far right side of the airbox.  Two 8mm self tapping screws takes the old one out, new one in (new part number, new design, upgrade) in under 5 minutes.  Voila, everything works as it should again.  Dealership wanted $125, this is a steal of a deal and came in a ford OEM part baggie.
B000C9MN2C|1|Made in the Chinese Republic of Taiwan.  It's flimsy, it fell apart the internal spring and small bb allowing for rocking and depressing flew out.  I expected better.  Iits almost as if it's a knock off
B002YXUISU|5|Perfect just what my boat needed.
B00D92ZTI4|5|Very good quality and they match my car perfectly, however I never received a gift box, I just got a plastic holder but I'm not complaining. These caps are great I would recommend them
B000BRCKTG|5|As described. Quick response.
B00BTL7P5M|5|good
