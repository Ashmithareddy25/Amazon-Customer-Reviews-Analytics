B00846REIS|3.0|The books were okay but I felt like I was reading Fifty Shades of Gray all over. They should have changed it up a bit.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Another to add to my collection and entertainment for me and my nieces to enjoy anytime we want. Great for that special sleepover...
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Very much like the Glee series.  Really enjoyed the singing and dancing.  Also liked the competitive nature of the story line.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I added this one to my collection then I can see them when I want and its entertainment for my nieces too.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I really enjoyed Mark and Ted in this movie.  Very incredible how the bear is so lifelike.  Highly recommend this movie.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is unfortunately the first Blu-Ray I have ordered through Amazon, which I now regret. I saw the low price and had to do it based on the fact that you're lucky to find one great movie at the same price, and not an amazing trilogy. Arrived quickly and looked as though I had bought it at any brick and mortar store.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Well, the story line hit home, and I was entertained the whole time, but Denzel just wasn't sparkling like he has done in the past.  Perhaps that is the point, not sure.
B004R0WKNE|4.0|Funny, feel good flick. Enjoyed it more than expected and love my Amazon Prime Instant Videos.  This service is the best!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|It was excellent and a very different role for Denzel Washington.  I have never seen him play this type of role before.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its cool<br />pony fans will like it<br />rarity is too expansive though she needs to qbe cheaper 70 gems that's outrageous
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris will always be remembered for being an American Hero.  This book is about yes is about killing but, killing for the right purpose to save American troops Chris was the best as saving our troops.  As a former U.S. Navy Sailor I am humbled by the things Chris was able to accomplish on the battle field.  American High School history classes across our country should make this book mandatory reading.<br /><br />From one Sailor to another Sailor I salute Chris Kyle.
0761169253|5.0|Personally, I bought this book because I was curious. Now I'm glad I bought it because it tells me things no other author/novelist/writer has told me before. Honestly, it seems like everything that has been creatively founded by their creators have been inspired by other people's stories. I kinda cringed at the word 'steal', but I guess it's okay for others to use. Or maybe not. Honestly, I like to call myself a remix/mash up artist. That's more positive as a title to use these days, I believe.<br /><br />Overall, this book Steal Like An Artist is a great way to learn something new about yourself. Truth is, we live in a world where there is hypocrisy, so I hope every writer learns something from this book and realize that no one is an original creator of their own stories.<br /><br />As for aspiring artists in any industry (literary, music, films), I would gladly recommend this book to you all. You don't have to use the word 'steal' I prefer remix or mash up artist as a title, which is pretty much the most useful. But props to Author Kleon by writing this nonfictional book. I do prefer you choose your own destiny while reading it as a word of caution.<br /><br />And remember, folks, everyone has the right to tell their own life story, especially when it comes to books like these. It's a positive item to have.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|And you only play against yourself, unless you get your family and friends to play it also, then you have each other's times to beat!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's a cute app that works well. I like the ability to use my own music to wake up to. The only negative I've found is to shut off the alarm (on the kindle fire hd) I have to unlock the first screen to get to the alarm to press snooze or stop. A little too much sometimes, early in the morning. Other than that, it's great. :)
B008476HBM|5.0|I have never read this classic before, but love the movie.<br />This book was excellent, I would recommend it to everyone!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I like this Angry Birds (Stars Wars HD) much better than some of the others. It poses some challenge but isn't so hard as to be frustrating. I like all the angry birds for the physics challenges they present. My grandkids don't even know they are learning anything, they just think they are having fun :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|He was a true American hero! Was very honored to read how he served our country and the love he had for our country. We need more people like him in the world!
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Love Sinatra, classic and timeless music, never gets old, the monologues are funny too.<br /><br />It is a must have in the collection.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. I could read it over and over again! It actually feels like you are there dealing with his pain as well.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was great. It made me laugh and cry...but in a good way. I can't wait to see the movie now!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|It is great I'm in tech school and its really nice to have something easily put away at night and get out the next day.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|A 12 year old romantic would love it.  I found it unbelievable and juvenile. Could have been a Harlequin book.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|My hero since I was a teenager!!! Great movie.Very interesting and moving--- More people should live their lives as he did-
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I haven't finished the whole season yet. I am about halfway through it. I absolutely love it. I loved the first season too but I think the story line in this season is way better and more developed. The characters are richer. I was unsure at first how they were going to use some of the actors from the first season but am so glad they did. Of course I adore Jessica Lange!
1878424319|5.0|I give this book a five because it really helped me through a rough time in my life and helped bring me a totally different perspective. The shipping was fast and the book truly captures you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin dozer is a good game and it would be cool in an arcade or D.S game with everything in it.
B0001I562I|5.0|The movie is a fun as it was when released. Enjoyed watching it again. The quality was not diminished by being transferred to DVD. If anything it appeared enhanced.  Breathless adventure, fit for young and old alike.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it! No problems watching this-thank you amazon!  This is a wonderful series! Stop thinking about it and just watch it-you will fall in love!
0205606288|2.0|Book looks great but when I got to King Lear, the whole second act was missing as was the whole first act of Macbeth. I'm returning the book beyond the return deadline and hopefully will get a full refund. Check the 1200's when you get your book.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Nice.  Works well, clean, easy to use, fast. Compact, does every thing I need it to do. Very likely to tell others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's fun and awesome. My sister has it on her ipod and she loves it. I play it on my dads kindel fire. It's a tad bit better then temple run, temple run 2, and brave temple run. I love this game a lot!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run fun I give it all five stars! fun fun fun fun.  I played it all day all the time warning it is addictive so be careful
B007PTJOV0|4.0|4 year old has a great time playing this game<br /><br />He likes the little characters. And likes to shoot the acorns. He says it is fun
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love this book it's the best. It is really heart warming and cool to find out about greeks and Romans. One of the best books ever
B005HJU7HA|4.0|So these stories are available free on project Gutenberg... But they are not organized as well as this compilation.  Is it worth it?  It was for me but you decide what's good for you.  I rate the stories at 5 stars.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Original.......[...] movie grows on you, at first I wasn't thrilled, but now I like it. Check out another original noir with humor, a book:  Howie Weener Unclogged.  Great noir humor packed into one.
B000LC55F2|5.0|It didn't get the respect it deserved.  Michael Caine is great as usual.  The story is fantastic in the truest sense of the word.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I got a Kindle Fire HD in December 2012 and the email app included with it will not sync well with my Yahoo email account (it did a little bit at first, albeit with emails coming in late, but now always tells me \\"Yahoo failed to authenticate\\").  I read about K-9 here, downloaded it, added my Yahoo email account to it, and .... voila -->>> I have all my emails uploaded and current.  The layout of the emails on this K-9 app is quite cumbersome, but it works okday for reading and replying to new emails, which is mostly what I want it for.  I would have given the app 5 stars but for the cumbersome design of the email inbox that the app provides.  [I'm still highly annoyed that the email function native to the Kindle Fire HD won't sync with my Yahoo email.  Amazon really needs to fix that, coz a lot of people are still using Yahoo email.]
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story was a little slow to start, but got interesting in about Chapter 6.  The characters drastically change during the story.  I would not recommend it to my friends.
B007S3S8HO|4.0|We picked up this product for my 7 year old son for Christmas. He's a huge Angry Birds fan, and was just thrilled to open this up for the big day. I was even a bit surprised myself at how much this toy ended up being. Setup took about 5-10 minutes, and then we were off...Literally having a real life game of Angry birds. The slingshot that is included works pretty good with the birds.. Boy can they fly! It's been a toy we find he consistently goes and sets up himself every couple or days or so to play around with. He's able to do it just fine himself, and it easily entertains him for a good 1-2 hours. It's fantastic. He often tries rearranging the setup to see if he can find new ways to have the birds hit the pigs.<br /><br />My one complaint is with some of the pieces. With one of the pigs (if you follow the directions on how to set it up) is on a piece that has wheels. The slightest touch can move that pig off the wheeled piece. Makes for the game to be won really easily, I suppose. My son gets frustrated with this often during setup, however. When he plays, he doesn't seem to care though, of course.<br /><br />Overall, pretty good product. It may not seem to be a hugely educational toy, but in many ways it is. He's learning about angles and now best to hit the piggie \\"targets.\\" In my book, that's better than the video game version any day.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|Movie could have been better written, especially if kept closer to source material. No truly jump out of your seat moments
B008B68J2G|5.0|I got this for my daughter who LOVES Monster High (as do all her friends in 1st-3rd grade).  I really wasn't looking for anything in particular other than just something new that she can use with her dolls.  Here's what I found:<br /><br />1. She loves the cute accents like the little hanging skull lights on the table umbrella<br />2. She loved playing with it and pretending her dolls were someplace amazing<br />3. It was easy to assemble with normal durability for a plastic toy accessory - thin, but durable enough<br />4. NO sticker accents - thank goodness!  Those #$^^$ stickers always end up everywhere but where they should!<br />5. Nothing special as far as play time - it needs your child/children's imagination!  They can make it into anything that they want it to be, but there are no whirling parts or buzzy bits or flippy switches that spit out candy or money or a glamorous lifestyle -- UNLESS your child imagines it does.<br />6. The colors were the normal girlie colors and not goth-y like some of the Monster High stuff seems to be.  I like that it has more of a neon/day-glo accent to all the toys in this line.<br />7. The chairs (as to be expected from EVERY type of doll playset ever!) do not fit the dolls well.  Honestly, the only way that they would fit the dolls and hold them into the seat worth anything is if they added seatbelts or some sort of torture-device type clamps.  Personally, I get it: I don't want some clamp attaching to a doll's legs - it just doesn't look right!<br /><br />Overall, my daughter likes it so I'm happy.  It isn't dark, there isn't emphasis on death or goth or anything like that (more like mythical/paranormal beings), so I like it.  And really, can we expect anything different with the age of Vampires, Werewolves and Zombies we live in? Yeah, right.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What do you get when you cross Pretty Woman with poor writing?  You get Fifty Shades of Grey!  This book was POORLY written.  There was NOTHING good about it.  In fact I was embarrassed to own it.  What a waste of money and eye sight.
B00340ESIS|4.0|The advice for writing screenplays is good advice for writing in general. It also makes you examine why you enjoy the stories you do.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My grand daughter and I love this game, she loves to pretend she is actually making all the fun meals on the menu!
6305128952|5.0|Excellent movie for families with older kids, the opening scene with the truck hitting the girls on horses is disturbing. But the rehabilitation of horse and rider is quite absorbing.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a game my grand sons all play. I have to admit I sneak and play it all the time too!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|This is the best action adventure animated film I've ever seen. It has humor, wit, insight and lots of action and a multi-strand story line without leaving loose ends. It has the feel of a live action feature. The film is fun. I recommend it highly.
B00BHMF578|5.0|The movie showed that the problems we are experiencing with Iran today are the result of America intervening in a foreign government's business back in the 70s!  We should have kept our nose out of their internal business!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Just what I needed to shop on the go...helps to keep track of my account when I'm not near my pc.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|ONE OF THE BETTER SEEK AND FINDS.  IT COULD HAVE MORE AND HARDER PUZZLES BUT OVERALL, VERY ENJOYABLE TO PLAY
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Have downloaded several Angry Birds apps and they don't get old. Easy way to keep boredom at bay. Highly addicting.
B003ZHR6T8|4.0|I ordered from amazon, it said new in package, but I think it might have been resealed after use. Either way it's a working disc so i have no complaints.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Have downloaded several Angry Birds apps and they don't get old. Easy way to keep boredom at bay. Highly addicting.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Basically it's a looooong MacGuyver episode on Mars. Good concept, nice first-person style; I simply got worn out after 200+ pages of &#34;and then this technical thing failed.&#34; Needed to be balanced with character development, and tightened up a bit (I'd say 100 of the 342 pages could be cut). Still, a good value for 99 cents, and as a first book, quite good. He's a talented writer, and I'd definitely read his next book.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love that I can access my music from anywhere with this app. Uploading my music was easy & listening is even easier.
B005LAII3U|5.0|This movie is much better than the original by 100000%. the acting is awesome. the special effects are the up to todays standards. The main charecter is more about abilities and cunning, and not about how big he is. In every way shape and form this movie is fun to watch.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Have downloaded several Angry Birds apps and they don't get old. Easy way to keep boredom at bay. Highly addicting.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|But the 3d just not as impressive as some of the other movies I have seen. Got a great deal on the combo so not complaining. I am only rating this 3 stars as a 3d movie.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Bought this season for my son for Christmas. House has it all and we both enjoy this show very much.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|I have only had my 3d for about a month now and so far have seen top gun, Spider-Man , shrek and Hubble and Hubble is probably the most impressive in 3d. A lot of the stars, etc. shoot out at you. If you want to show your 3d and home theatre off....this is the one to do it with .
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love being able to read my books wherever I go. Easy to use & easy to find new items to read.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Unbelieveably real story here..I had to watch it twice,,,This movie imacts the mind and soul in so many ways. Brace yourself for an extremely realistic &#34;real life&#34; drama  Superb acting, and screenwriting....it will grab you, and stay with you for a long time!...It is adult/mature in it's nature...so, watch with caution...it pulls no punches....
B004Y042N8|5.0|Love this game but can be frustrating in the higher levels. Definitely keeps you &#34;on your toes&#34;. Addicting to play.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took me a while to get really into the book and when I finally did,I couldn't put it down..............if keeps you on your toes but j hated the ending !
B005C9YZKU|5.0|I am SO glad having decided to purchase this limited edition...my husband and our friends never tire of watching this particular series... Mother Nature truly does keep peace and balance of our Mother Earth!
B009EEFTMC|2.0|I did not figure it out.  my granddaughter liked it and were playing it.  When I figure it out, I might like it better.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The original Mafia...glorified, but at the same time, sickening...but those were the days when the Mafia truly controlled the imports and exports...thank goodnesss the elder mafia WAS against the drug cartels...unfortunately, the Mafia, of whatever nationality, or country, is now purportedly controlling the drug trades...sad, but true!
B006T5C5PS|4.0|The ideas behind this seem wonderful. Bus as the treatment itself is not available in the States, it is sad that only those rich enough to travel and pay for the treatment outside the country could truly benefit. The book would get 5 stars, but loses one to the legalities of medicine.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great. Don't know how they will make a movie, but enjoyed the book alot. Still its just a book like many others
B009K72RRS|5.0|I love this cartoon. I have been a fan over the years of the &#34;Star Wars&#34; franchise. I particularly like this series because of the graphics being used.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Recommended again to alot of people. Also could not wait for Book 3, Also a good story line. Really enjoyed.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Their music is evolving with class.  Loved it...so much so I bought tickets for this year's tour coming to Washington on August 14, 2013.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Thought it was a good story line. Couldn't wait to read the second. Also recommended to other people to read.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Great story.  Excellent quality.  Great rainy day or weekend movie to watch and get a warm fuzzy feeling!  I've watched it many times and will always have it in my personal library.  Very well done!!!
B007BVOEPI|4.0|This suspenseful series draws you in, and you find yourself wanting to continue on. The only unfortunate part is that you definetly can't watch it with the kids around I wouldn't even feel comfortable with a 16+ year old watching it full frontal nudity and lots of blood.
1616550414|5.0|My boyfriend absolutely loved this!  The cover is beautiful as are all of the images within!  This was a steal for the price!
0440245915|5.0|If you loved this book, like I did then you'll be excited to hear that John Grisham will be talking about it on World Book Club which is on the BBC's World Service.<br />They are asking for questions for John Grisham as they are recording it on the 13th March! You can email them to worldbookclub@bbc.co.uk<br />Thought this might interest you all!
B005NPCJ88|3.0|I feel a little bad for leaving a 3-star review for this, because 5FDP here is at least daring to be different. \\"Way of the Fist\\" and \\"War is the Answer\\" were unrelenting and brutal with a strong theme of war, violence, and fighting throughout. I thought they were great, but also that they've played that out and needed some change for the new album or risk being stagnant.<br />\\"American Capitalist\\" focuses more on class conflict than physical conflict, and the sound is different - slower, with more in common with hard rock and grunge than with heavy metal and metalcore. Again, not a bad thing, it's good for a band to change things up, but the results just don't work for me.<br />First of all, they might have gone too far from what they're good at in one step. I loved the opening onslaughts to the first two albums, 'Ashes' and 'Dying Breed', and there's nothing close to them here, except maybe '100 Ways to Hate'. It just doesn't sound like 5FDP, somehow. And that wouldn't be bad if the new stuff was just as good, but there's too many slow songs and most are let down by the lyrics. I don't even know what's going with \\"The Pride\\", and most of the other songs are good but not great and don't grab your attention. 'Coming Down' and 'Remember Everything' (the best of the slower songs) are the standouts for me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's such a innovative sci-fi show that doesn't take itself too seriously, a great mix of adventure, drama, horror and humor. Too bad people prefer dumber TV shows these days. We watched Galatica and Walking Dead and found them lacking compared to Firefly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first book I have had trouble putting down in a very long time. Howey has a fantastic style of writing that paints such a vivid picture, it makes it feel like there is a Silo just down the street. Wool is a great series, and I cannot wait to read more.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I find myself using my apple and it's u tube . I will use my Kindle u tube when I don't have my Apple with me.
0393317552|5.0|Right price, studied Diamonds theories in school for a while amend finally decided I'd have to pick up his book.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Thanks for the $1.99 download sale. I put the whole album on my MP3 player.  It was nice to have new Train music to listen to!
B000ID37T0|5.0|Would recommend it highly for any fan of Al Pacino.  No wonder Pacino received an award for this movie.  Loved it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|keeps me entertained. free but options to lag. I did not find that I needed to pah more to enjoy it
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This puzzle game is easy to use, and the graphics are great. I enjoyed other Patchworkz games from Big Fish, so the HD makes it even better.
B0068THAGY|3.0|There are some amusing theatrics and enough going on to keep your eyes on the screen, but mostly this is a movie of pure cliche - misunderstood aliens, kids bravely defying their parents on matters of shallow emotional &#34;principals,&#34; tween romance, family reconciliation.
B007REV4T8|5.0|this may be my new favorite bond film of all time, Daniel Craig did an amazing job as 007 in this film. delivery was right on time and i got it the moment i got home from work. if you haven't seen this 007 film get it.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|The whole idea of treating life as a video game pretty much gives you what to expect here. I like the concept, right down to the juvenile pee bar, so it works for me. Bonus points for Ramona's believable contradictions. One star off for the superficial, typical, and thinly supported transformation of the titular character from a truly shallow person to moral redemption through self-belief.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Very good extra protection for an expensive product.  Very good fit & looks good on the Garmin 800. YES Recommend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent show, actorsand download - thank you Amazon prime for the access to quality programming - wish there were more like this
B00908DDZM|4.0|I've been listening a little bit to macklemore and felt like picking this up. it was cheap and the rhymes are pretty great. I'm not a big hip hop/rap listener but the instrumentals and lyrics were pretty good. don't take this review with a grain of salt because this is just one mans opinion. if other reviewers say buy it, then do it!!!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Best book ever it capes you hanging to the very end.<br />I'm looking forward to the rest of this awesome series
B003INBOE2|5.0|Donnie Yen is one of the most underrated martial artists out there. He has the swiftness of Jet Li and the tenacity of Bruce Lee. It was a real treat watching him portray Ip Man. You can look up the synopsis on wiki or something. But the action sequences in this film are incredible and very explosive. The music score brings real passion into every scene and truly puts this story in your heart. This is the tale of a man who stands up for what is right and the representation of a country's honor.<br /><br />Amazing film and a must buy for an martial arts fan
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Can't wait for the holidays to put this movie in and BELIEVE again. Thank you for letting my kids still have the hope and BELIEVE in the dreams.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|A revision of the Scarlet Letter, this is extremely witty and entertaining.  Not your normal chick flick, but a thoughtful comedy.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty (2012) is the best movie that I've seen in 2013. The story is gripping, the acting is outstanding, and you walk away feeling that you've witnessed something significant and moving.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain plays Maya, an intelligence officer obsessed with finding Usama Bin Laden (\\"UBL\\"). Maya spends about ten years of her life chasing various meandering leads, pressing her superiors to follow her research and hunches, and finally, as we know, all the zealous effort results in a monumental and historical raid and kill. Chastain is great as Maya; you won't recognize her in comparison to her performance as the ditzy, blond stay-at-home wife in The Help. The access that the filmmakers must have had to CIA and other intelligence personnel to create Maya's character made the story and character true to form, even if some of it turns out to be false.<br /><br />The torture scenes during the first ¼ of the film are over-hyped. I was expecting much worse. By today's movie violence standards, the torture was tame and not gruesome. The unwarranted controversy that Zero Dark Thirty has created stems from the implication that torture led to information, which led to UBL's comeuppance. That implication is clear, but I did not walk away thinking that this film condones torture or \\"enhanced interrogation techniques.\\" On the contrary, later in the film it becomes clear that the intelligence community's use of such tactics has been criticized publicly and politically, actually jeopardizing the license to conduct an all-out manhunt by any means. To say that a message of this film is that \\"torture works\\" is incorrect.<br /><br />UBL is only in a few minutes of this film, but Maya's obsession with finding him makes him a of pot of gold or trophy. We learn a lot about how Al Qaeda ran its operations in the 2000s, relying upon some very primitive means of communication (basically person-to-person) to spread messages between key operatives and their underlings. UBL wasat the top, but he was in deep hiding for years after 9/11. The interspersing of scenes of other terrorist acts linked to or credited to Al Qaeda builds the drama and importance of bagging the trophy, UBL.<br /><br />The portrayal of the raid of UBL's fortress in Pakistan is brilliantly executed. It is believable. It is terrifying. It is, ultimately, gratifying. Knowing that things went wrong during the raid (a helicopter crash, for instance), leaving the top folks in U.S. government on pins and needles for dozens of harrowing, nail-biting minutes, this portion of the film has a tinge of dread throughout. You are just waiting for a Navy Seal to get shot, stabbed, or maimed. When they \\"get their man,\\" the reactions of relief, disbelief, pride, and a continued focus on completing the mission are great acting and filmmaking.<br /><br />See this film. It may not be a History Channel documentary and, therefore, its accuracy is not beyond question, but as entertainment it is top notch. You can't ask much more of your movie than to build human drama, create procedural suspense, and execute fast-moving action in a carefully constructed package.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game, it is one of the best ones out there. I have played every level several times and keep coming back for more. Hopefully there will be some more New packs soon
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Auggie has always had facial disorders. But that never stopped. Read a lovely tale of a boy struggling with a new life at . Middle school.
030758836X|4.0|\\"She wasn't on the water, she wasn't in the house. Amy was not there. Amy was gone.\\" - page 24 Gone Girl<br /><br />Gone Girl surprised me, and I like to think that that's hard to do. Not only was the plot relatively unpredictable, the characters and what they're each hiding is thrilling. Gillian Flynn surprised me by not being your run-of-the-mill mystery/thriller author. Flynn's characters were not only dynamic, they brought to mind a person that you knew and never understood before. There was an amount of Humbert Humbert (from Lolita) in them. I won't say how much, that would spoil the novel, and the subject matter is thankfully quite different. In Gone Girl, Flynn discusses our ideas and ideals of marriage. But I digress, here's a synopsis for you:<br /><br /> The book starts with Nick, a married man in his 30s celebrating his fifth anniversary with his wife, Amy. They live in Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri, where they moved almost two years previously, after each losing their jobs in New York City and Nick found out his mother was dying. Amy resents Nick for having moved them away from her hometown, and Nick resents her resentment.<br /><br /> And then, Amy disappears. The novel switches to a diary entry from Amy from seven years before, when she met Nick. From then on we see Nick's story unravel in present time while we get to hear Amy's side of the story through her diary.<br /><br />  \\"Give me a man with a little fight in him, a man who calls me on my bulls***. (But who also kind of likes my bulls***.)\\" - page 29 Gone Girl<br /><br /> I don't know how much I can say without ruining some plot twist for you, but do be warned it is a bit slow for a thriller. I would not say it was boring, or that you could leave it for long, but you are physically capable of putting the book down, as opposed to The Hunger Games. I might even classify it in the Song of Ice and Fire realm...you can put it down, but inevitably you want to know who done it!<br /><br /> All of the characters seemed like possible suspects: from old stalkers to jealous in-laws, the husband or too-good-to-be-true parents possibly masquerading as psychotics? this is where my mind goes. And while the suspect was on my list of suspects...when every character you've heard mentioned even once is on your list, it's rather likely that you'll at least guess. But the method, and the story behind Amy's disappearance...just wait until you get there.<br /><br />  \\"It's a very difficult era in which to be a person, just a real, actual person, instead of a collection of personality traits selected from an endless Automat of characters.\\" - page 73 Gone Girl<br /><br />See more books I love at [..]ects: from old stalkers to jealous in-laws, the husband or too-good-to-be-true parents possibly masquerading as psychotics? this is where my mind goes.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was so amazing! I just could not put the books down! I read all three books in less than a week!
0316056898|3.0|I was pretty excited to read this book for some reason.<br /><br />I'm not much of a Tina Fey fan (I can't watch 30 Rock because the characters annoy me actually!), but I've always found her interesting.<br /><br />Maybe I just imagined the book to be different, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />The thing is, I did get a few laughs out of it, but that was about it. To me, it wasn't very interesting, her book isn't really \\"honest.\\" The entire book just comes off as one giant humble brag where she talks about all these great things that happened, but then makes all these cracks about how awkward and weird looking she is.<br /><br />What she doesn't really mention is how beautiful most men think she is, so when she cracks all these jokes about her looks they just don't ring true.<br /><br />I was just hoping for more of a look into who she really is, but the book is basically joke time. I did laugh a few times, but for me it just interesting or funny enough to recommend.<br /><br />Also, if you're looking for a better look at the world of SNL, check out the fantastic \\"Live From New York.\\"
141659521X|5.0|Easy to order.  Arrived as scheduled.  Another great read from Vince Flynn.  Keeps you on edge and a must &#34;hurry and finish&#34; book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Once again another great season at the Abbey, but there were a few low points with the loss of characters.  I like &#34;Happy ever after&#34;!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the best film adaption of Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Jennier Ehle as Lizzy and Colin Firth as the dashing Mr. Darcy have wonderful chemistry together. The other actors in the film are just as wonderful. Wonderful movie. One of my all time favorites.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I was a little leery of this but bought it anyway because of the cast.  Because of the cast, it was a great movie - it kept you interested through the whole story.  I understand there will be a sequel - can't wait until it comes out!
B00001W9G0|5.0|What a wonderful film! The film score is so beautiful. Streisand and Redford have wonderful chemistry together on screen. This is a classic love story told beautifully in this film. Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the challenge of trying to unlock all the games with a wide variety of games to do it with, that way if there are certain ones you like better, you can just play those for points.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have always loved this game on my computer and it is awesome. But when I figured out that I can get it an my kindle I was amazed. For all you people think it is to violent its not. My teacher's son has it and he is 4. This app is great if you like games that are based on real life. I love the multiplayer setting  you can have your friends over and play. But to play with your friends you need a Wi-Fi connection if you like swords bows picaxe s and shovels and hoes well download this app! When people say that they don,t like it well I say that's bull crap. I love this app and I think you should get it too!!!!!!!!!
B001C1066E|4.0|I knew based on the pictures I was getting a knock off of the licensed Naruto coin pouch.  But seeing the price difference between the real thing and this one, I took my chances.  The construction is mediocre quality.  It's held together just fine but it is obviously imperfect. The pouch itself is smaller than I thought, but I fixed that myself.  The only thing that really bothers me is that the one I got has these weird felt eyes and I wanted the the googly eyes, but again, I can fix that myself.  So in this case you get what you pay for, but honestly it's just a coin purse so I wasn't willing to spend $15 to get the &#34;prettier&#34; one. Either way, I get excited to see the look on a cashiers faces every time I pull it out and ask them to &#34;Feed my froggy please.&#34;
0061689246|5.0|I saw this movie years ago when a friend recommended it and didn't realise it was a book first.  I came across The Graveyard Book recently and saw that he had written this one too.  I loved that book and so ordered this on as well.  So glad I did.  It is a really wonderful story for anyone who loves fairy tales, romance, adventure or even just likes to believe magic is out there to be found in the world.  I only remembered that I had seen the movie after the first chapter.  It is very similar to the book. Great read, I loved it and would highly recommend it for most anyone. ( Only problem with younger readers is that there is some sex and language - not much - but may be uncomfortable for young teens and children.)
B007STXHTM|4.0|This flat port GoPro housing allows for better focus while taking dive videos.  My only complaint is that it should come with an appropriate snap-on red filter to color-correct underwater photos and videos.  A good one is available on Amazon but is, of course, an additional expense.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|I have owned this movie for years and &#34;lost&#34; it recently, so it was great to be able to buy it again and store it online for viewing any time.  Of the three in the series, this is still the best IMO.
0738727326|4.0|Beautiful illustrations, didn't really buy it to fortune tell, but the booklet seemed to only be marginally helpful, but other than that, a gorgeous set of cards!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|At last, a book where the teens act like teens, and life is messy. It took a bit of patience to get past the first few chapters, but I was crying by the end, so stick with Sky & Holder, you'll love them in the end.
0553062182|5.0|Definitely would recommend to HSPs or sensitive people in general, this explained a lot about me and my sister, and I haven't even finished the book!
B008OHV4PG|5.0|If you are a Neil Young fan it's a must have! Takes you back and interesting home video of him. Recommend to the true fans.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Big fan of the earlier movies, however I loved the great stunts, action and loved the surprise at the very end
B00821OX98|5.0|Series is better than I expected. If you like aliens and sci-fi stuff, this is one of the series you will like.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Lovely to watch, listen too and follow.....just wish that there were more episodes available...I can't bear to wait for another season!!!
B001P1MZNI|5.0|How can you not love Sinatra? This is him at his best and I will love having it to listen to on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin.... never fails to creat good music, with meaningful lyrics. Great guitar work as usual and his voice never falters. I wish the Moodies would come out with new music as well. Thanks to the Moodies and Justin for all the years of great music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best series that I've ever watched, (three times.) Excellent acting, gorgeous clothing, sweet plots. Can't get any better.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|great adventure and fast paced....just great entertainment....also liked the fact that there did not appear to be language that was offensive...I think kids would enjoy this watching with parents...Fun movie....i hope there are more
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|1. poor character development (especially between Forrest and the woman who left Chicago).  Also - why was the new deputy so cruel?  Again, poor character development.<br />2. several scenes filmed without accompanying light; had to listen to what was going on instead of viewing during several scenes.  Would be fine if the darkness lended to the movie, however, it seemed it was a cheaper way of filming this movie.<br />3. really great cast - that's the reason for 2 stars.<br />4. overall disappointing and felt like a waste of time... : (
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm not an avid reader but after reading the 50 shades series I stumbled upon the Crossfire trilogy. What an amazing story!  I fell in love with the characters ... A much better read than 50 shades!  I can't wait for book 3!  Kind of bummed I have to wait til June.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it! I preordered the second book and can not wait until it arrives to my kindle. I think I got little sleep for two days as this page turner kept me going. I loved the bad boy gone good.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|I love SciFi and Westerns so this was a no-brainer purchase since I missed it in the theaters... But somehow, it just doesn't work. Maybe it was the editing for length, but it feels like for half the movie you're scratching your head going HUH? Well you figure it all out by then end. But by then you care a little less.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|What hasn't been said about the beautiful and talented Kelly Clarkson. Former Idol winner to mega star. Nothing fake or ignorant about her....can't say that about past Idol winners. Great CD. Looking forward to many more great years from her.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|My daughter loves all things chipmunks/chipettes so this was a must buy in our house and has probably been watching over 200 times. It's pretty cute and I like how it teaches Alvin a lesson about responsibility. If you like the first two Chipmunk movies then you'll probably like this one too! :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best he on the Amazon app store. I positively sure of it . It's a little pricey but worth the 7 bucks buy but if u see a minecraft slenderman don't buy it it is just a big waste of money it's just a bunch of pictures. Don't buy that game it sucks
B002HFP0R4|5.0|I got this as a gift and the recipient loved it! It was just what she wanted and seems great for any Bee Gees fan!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Liked this camera a lot, it's cheep but it takes good pics.  would have been nice if kindle had put a camera on the back, because it makes it hard to take the picture.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is great for my grandson who is 2 1/2 keeps him occupy for hours at a time. He loves it.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|With so many vampire movies, books, etc., it is a terrific to read the original.  Jonathon Harker's description of the count and his confinement the original scare!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Jeff Kinney's work was okay but kind of left me hanging at some parts. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are getting shorter if you ask me. I feel that the book should have been part of a bigger story about Greg's feelings about love.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is not just a movie about a console, its music history.  Watching the footage, old and new, of some of my favorite bands is just thrilling. Combine that with my love of analog tech (built my first tube amp at 17) and I've got a movie i love.  I bought it on digital download, and you can bet bluray is next to get the most out of the music.<br />FYI: Grohl had an excellent interview with Chris Hardwick on the nerdist podcast. A great value add.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|This was a pleasant watch.  I think the times were even harsher on woman than were portrayed here.  More entertaining.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|These are classics. Just free your whole day, sit back and make some pasta and enjoy. Pacino,Caan, and Brando what else do you need.
B000IAZ5HK|3.0|This shaker is an attractive design and will fit, without the stopper, in almost any decor.  The glass is quite thin and I don't think would survive a short drop to a hard surface.  My only objection is that it is absurdly overpriced.  Unfortunately, there are not many options.
1451627297|5.0|Stephen King has written a book that both entertains and stimulates thought.  My book club chose this book in spite of its length.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Yup. That's about it, you know.<br /><br />It's a good game. I even play it over Skyrim sometimes. Sometimes.<br /><br />WORD MINIMUMS ARE NOT COOL. :)
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have been looking for ages for a game like this!!! The graphics are terrific,  background  music is just that, softly in the background...I would highly reccommend this game to everyone, finally<br />!!
B000PY6BBI|1.0|The film was not delivered in HD, it was letter boxed in low resolution, streaming performance was poor.. very disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has it all. The suspense, a little romance, thrill, and that one thing that keeps you reading all night. This book is pure perfection. By the way I'm nine
1907590331|3.0|“Of Mice and Men” tells the story of two friends who wander from ranch to ranch to make money, and hopefully, own their own farm someday. The only Achilles’ heel in this plan is Lenny, a giant of a man with the mind of a child, who tends to get in trouble although he is full of good intentions.<br /><br /> “Of Mice and Men” has similar social criticisms to “The Grapes of Wrath”, also written by John Steinbeck. I am aware it was published before “The Grapes of Wrath”, but still I recommend reading “The Grapes of Wrath” which is a better version of “Of Mice and Men.” The plot and characters are more developed, and the message behind it is deeper. In my opinion, “The Grapes of Wrath” is better in every aspect.
B007Y1JGOY|4.0|I do believe this is there third album. I also have 'April Rain' and would say that this is even better than that they keep getting better as time goes by and I love the song 'we are the others' it has real meaning behind and challenge anyone who reads this if they haven't already to go and see the story behind the song. I would recommend this to any one who is into bands like Nightwish, Sirenia, Epica, within Temptation and Xandria.
1451648537|5.0|I was eagerly anticipating reading this biography, chiefly because Steve Jobs is a man who has fascinated me for many years and his effect on the modern world is impressive.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was written by master biographer Walter Isaccson, which is another great reason to read this book. I have read in the past his biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Einstein and enjoyed them both.<br /><br />This biography has provided great insight into Steve Jobs’ way of thinking, his life philosophy and his eccentric behavior, which I found to be very interesting and unusual (in a good way).<br /><br />My only disappointment from this book is that it seems that Isaccson rushed through the last part of the book in order to publish it as close as possible to Jobs’ death. Other than that this is a great read.
1401308201|5.0|So glad to have the chance to get this book. Thought it was only available at the production and was delighted to get a great copy.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I don't listen to a lot of hip hop, etc.  However, this made me want to hear more current stuff in the genre.  The album is incredible.
0007447868|1.0|To start, I have to say I truly enjoyed the first three books of the story.  Even then I felt that Martin had written more than he had story to tell.  That thought became overwhelming in A Feast for Crows.  Instead of focusing on characters and plot elements developed in the first three long books, we are suddenly introduced to whole sets of new or previously very peripheral characters and plotlines.  I found myself skimming over chapter about Dorne and the Ironmen, reading only enough to note major points.  I found myself thinking, \\"who cares about this?\\"<br /><br />On the positive side, Jaime's character continued to develop in interesting ways.  Unfortunately, that's about the only positive thing I can say about the book.  I was so thoroughly bored with it that, although I did plug through to the end, I cannot now generate any interest in A Dance with Dragons, the 5th book in the series.  The first three books were good enough that I may try again on the 5th - after a hiatus to abate the bad taste from the 4th. Too bad there isn't a Cliff Notes version for A Feast for Crows.  I would have rather read a 20 page synopsis and then moved on.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the game but whenever I try to open it on my kindle fire it closes before I can start :( its getting quite annoying
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have Jake tricky Lucy and so on this game is so much fun but today is carmen ' s last day but still the game is fun LUV IT buy it it's worth it :D
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like it a whole lot and it's great to play but takes a short amount of time to download
B005PK1G76|5.0|So far I really like this product. It fits my bob and although it has soft material, it does have shape. I like the two cup holders and the inside pocket. It's a good price compared to the bob handle ba console.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I had and still have issues with accessing my Yahoo account using the mail app on my S3. The rep at the Verizon store couldn't resolve it either and suggested I download the Yahoo mail app.<br />It's as function as the web desktop version, no issues.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This was a good place to check the forecast,I used the city option to get  cities north and south to get a better idea of what the weather is doing .I haven't had this app for very long when it asked for a review
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Perfect, beautifully shot with exciting and wonderful soundtrack scoring favored with drums and Arabic sounds. Price was really nice too.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|One of the best racing movies ever.  Cinemotography is absosutely breathtaking. Considering that there is no computer graphics and all scenes are shot real it is just amazing.  This movie could not be made today the way it was made in 1962.  This is the best Formula 1 movie ever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is not normally something i would play but the little one likes it and im getting into playing it myself.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Great romantic movie, kind, smart and moving. Can be watched over and over again. The quality is awesome. Highly recommended.
B007O70QB0|5.0|If you don't feel like tracking down a vintage copy, this is a very nice reissue.... Gatefold package and dead-quiet vinyl. I picked it up for $20 from a secondary seller and couldn't be happy.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Nice approach to the story. I liked the first part of the book the best. Good suspense. How did Defuenso get into the bunker?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you can play all day long and not be bored. It is so fun!!!!! Play this great game and join us to help us take care of horses!!!!!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Found this little device to be just what I was looking for.  It provides enough amplification to allow me to listen to some of my movies on the plane.  My player didn't provide enough volume especially during low passages in the movie to hear it over the noise on the plane.  It's small size and included cables makes it very convenient and easy to use.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|what a good album, cant get enough of macklemore, a loooot better then a lot of crappy rappers now a days that only talk about sex and drugs
B007SGM084|1.0|I did not like  the books, it was somewhat bording flith.Some may like it but to me it was very repiticous in the worse way.Would not recommend it it to real women.Sorry!
B00A83075M|5.0|My 2 year old and I go to a lot of movies and she definitely has an opinion when it comes to what she likes. We have seen Ralph 10 times and shes still in love with this movie she laughs through out and really enjoys Ralph. The only part that seemed to scare her was near the beginning when they visit the hero's duty game however that's one about 10 minutes in a 2 hour film. Her favorite part is at the end when the music come on and she adores the theme song.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun it is very very life like in very many ways I absolutely love this game it is great for all ages and it really teaches a child how to take of a of a life like horse
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I had high expectations for this cd since doo wops and hooligans was such a great mix of sounds and I wasn't disappointed. This cd has a great 80's sound (from Sting to Michael Jackson) to reggae, to a retro 40's style song and Bruno's own style mixed into each. Such a great variety all sung and written by such a talented artist.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this because my daughter was having fun with it on her iPod. Thought, \\"Well, why not try it?\\"  It's a fun game and almost as addictive as TempleRun2. Great job with the graphics and gameplay. I would recommend this to all.<br />:-)
0679735909|5.0|Took me a few (hundred) pages to get into the book (Possession) but so worth it to finish it.  Hard to believe Ms. Byatt could write poetry & prose so well that I was convinced Ash and LaMotte existed. I have refused to pass my copy along until I re-read some of the poetry. Not everyone will agree however because it is a little dense.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I wish there were different levels and sets in a game.it gets boring. I wish that the game had done kind of end point.this game is like the song that doesn't end.l other than that it's fun.
0545101425|5.0|Bought this book for my grandson who has difficulty reading and he<br />loved the book. He read along with the cd. I wish they offered more<br />packages of the book and read along CD.
0156027321|5.0|This is a classic and I had to read it before seeing the film. It was a quick read, but contained adequate vocabulary to make it not a child's book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not one moment of this book leaves you willing or able to put it down. At once heartbreaking and exhilarating, you won't rest until the story concludes. It is a story of survival, at times distinctively futuristic and at other moments calling to mind a more barbaric time in history. Katniss is the perfect heroine. Not just relatable or admirable but also flawed and at times distant. Her motives are not always pure or simple, but through the course of the story we come to root for her spirit of determination and raw pursuit of truth and justice. Her vulnerability is matched only by her courage. I have read this book and this trilogy over a dozen times and have yet to want to stop reading.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|season three is wonderful, the writers do a wonderful job of blending the family and modern times at the world of downton.  there is some heartbreak, to be sure, but more doors were opened than were closed.  highly recommend!

B007REV4YI|5.0|unlike the rest of the series, which relies heavily on misogyny and gratuitous sex, this movie is actually character driven. oscar winners galore in the cast with nice nods to previous bond movies and the spectacular chase and stunt scenes we have come to expect.

1933633867|1.0|First off, I gave this book one star rather than zero stars simply because there was some historical information about debt and money.  Unfortunately, I found the title of the book quite misleading.  The title might make one think that the book's main point is to educate on the history of debt.  It does this to some degree, therefore it gets one star.  What the book really is though is Dr. Graeber's  personal attack on capitalism and free markets.  Dr. Graeber is clearly very knowledgeable when it comes to anthropology.  He also, clearly, does not like capitalism and free markets and doesn't seem to think much of economists.  This concept is pervasive throughout the entire book.  Now this is not why the book gets only one star from me.  There is nothing wrong with disliking capitalism or free markets.  I think most reasonable people would agree that there are problems with capitalism and free markets.  The problem with the book is a lack of support for his statements and positions and a lack of possible solutions to the things he sees as problems.  In fact, he offers only one proposal at the end of the book to deal with what he sees as problems.  The quote is as follows.<br /><br /> \\"It seems to me that we are long overdue for some kind of Biblical-style Jubilee: one that would affect both international debt and consumer debt.  It would be salutary not just because it would relieve so much genuine human suffering...\\"<br /><br />  The quote continues for a bit but never in the book does Graeber explain how a cancellation of debt would relieve so much genuine human suffering.  He makes statements like this throughout the book without backing them up in any way.  Think about what would happen if there was a cancellation of all debt.  It would be economically distastrous for the world.  It would increase genuine human suffering.  Economies around the world would fail causing a worldwide depression.  Banks would fail, followed by businesses, followed by massive unemployment, followed by more poverty and human suffering.<br /><br />  Never in his book does he look at third world countries as internal problems with corrupt governments but rather accuses rich countries of keeping them down.  Again, he does not back any of this up with any empirical evidence.  Never in his book does he address the issue of allocating resources which is what economics is ultimately about.  How can resources get allocated in a way that does the most good for the most people?  This the fundamental problem with Communism and Socialism.  They are inefficient at allocating resources, which leads to waste and a lower standard of living.<br /><br /> We could dissect the book at length and find numerous problems but I want this review to be short so that people will hopefully read it and therefore, read this book for what it really is.  Again, it's okay to have opinions and disagree, but you should have facts and evidence to back up claims.  The evidence in his book is all about history and anthropology which is why he should have written a book about that, leaving his political and economical views out.  I also find it interesting that he has so much contempt for a capitalist system that was good enough for him to be educated in, good enough for him to work in, good enough for him to write his book in, and good enough for him to live in.  If Dr. Graeber is so intent on making this world a better place, he should begin by looking at the world in a realistic way.  This is what economics is about.  On top of all this, the book is quite incoherent as well which makes it convenient for him to rebut any negative reviews by accusing readers of being biased.  He may say that capitalism is only mentioned a few times in the book for instance.  Don't let him fool you.  First and foremost, this book is about his own political views but is masked by some anthropology.  I find it very difficult to believe that, if the objective history was actually his main purpose, he would still have put so much emphasis (in clever ways so as not to be held to them) on contempt for capitalism and free markets.

B000UNYK3A|1.0|Hostel(released Sept/05)stars,among others,Jay Hernandez as Paxton,Derek Richardson as Josh,Eyþ&oacute;r Guðj&oacute;nsson as &Oacute;li, and Barbara Nedelj&aacute;kov&aacute; as Natalya.I was recently handed this one and didn`t know anything about the film,except Taranino was involved,which piqued my interest.It turned out it was yet another of such plot lines with people getting into places they don't belong and barely escaping with their lives,if at all.But as the film got deeper and deeper into the story,the gore got worse and worse and it became totally gratuitous to the extreme.How many sawed off body parts,drills to the body and blood squirting and spattering everywhere,does one need to see before it is too much.Not alot,but for director/producer/writer Roth,&#34;just one more for the road&#34;,seemed to be his motto.<br />The story finds three young men,two American and one Icelandic,back packing across Europe.They get a tip from a young man about this hostel in Czechoslovakia,that's not on any maps.The three travel there and manage to hook up with some local action.The next morning Oli,their Icelandic friend,goes missing.We have a cut scene where we see Oli's disembodied head on a table.<br />That night at a disco Josh feels sick and goes back to the hostel.Later Paxton gets sick and gets lost finding the disco washroom and is locked in a closet instead. The next morning Paxton gets out and finds Josh has gone missing also.Josh,we have seen,was being held prisoner by a man who they had all previously met on the train going to the hostel.He tortured and killed Josh.<br />Paxton is at loose ends and decides to have a local girl take him to a museum before he finally leaves later.She takes him out to an old factory and he becomes,like his two friends,an unwilling participant in the &#34;wheel of torture&#34; game.He loses three fingers but manages to fight and gain his freedom.He inadvertently runs into a fellow American who mistakes him for a client.It seems this whole factory is set up as a large torture chamber for those willing to pay good money for the experience.As Paxton is outside he hears the screams of an Oriental girl he knows and he returns.He extricates her and they both flee to the train station.When she sees her horribly disfigured face she deliberately jumps in front of the in bound train.Paxton gets on and is heading away from this nightmare when he hears the voice of the man that killed Josh.When the train makes a brief stop he gets off and follows the man into the washroom.There he gets his revenge by slicing a part of his hand off and cutting his throat.He gets back on the train and leaves.<br />This isn't Nightmare on Elm Street,whose violence had an air of tongue in cheek to it.This is not Kill Bill,where we had a lady on a mission whose unreal acrobatics took the violence to a totally different place.No,what we have here is gore just for gore's sake,as the plot plays it all too seriously.We get to see every slice,vein and blood spattering.And believe me,there is blood everywhere in this gigantic torture chamber.In every room there is something twisted and sick going on.It is definitely not for the faint of heart,let me tell you.Long before the end I was totally sickened by what I was seeing.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and was generally clear and crisp,although the film was grainy in some spots.Extras include featurettes,the trailer,commentary and a look at a specific scene with three different angles.<br />All in all a terribly gory and in my opinion,sick movie.The film plays its plot straight as the three enter a twisted scenario where clients get to pay to torture victims in any way they want.A must to avoid.as a large torture chamber for those willing to pay good money for the experience.As Paxton is outside he hears the screams of an Oriental girl he knows and he returns.He extricates her and they both flee to the train station.When she sees her horribly disfigured face she deliberately jumps in front of the in bound train.Paxton gets on and is heading away from this nightmare when he hears the voice of the man that killed Josh.When the train makes a brief stop he gets off and follows the man into the washroom.There he gets his revenge by slicing a part of his hand off and cutting his throat.He gets back on the train and leaves.<br />This isn't Nightmare on Elm Street,whose violence had an air of tongue in cheek to it.This is not Kill Bill,where we had a lady on a mission whose unreal acrobatics took the violence to a totally different place.No,what we have here is gore just for gore's sake,as the plot plays it all too seriously.We get to see every slice,vein and blood spattering.And believe me,there is blood everywhere in this gigantic torture chamber.In every room there is something twisted and sick going on.It is definitely not for the faint of heart,let me tell you.Long before the end I was totally sickened by what I was seeing.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and was generally clear and crisp,although the film was grainy in some spots.Extras include featurettes,the trailer,commentary and a look at a specific scene with three different angles.<br />All in all a terribly gory and in my opinion,sick movie.The film plays its plot straight as the three enter a twisted scenario where clients get to pay to torture victims in any way they want.A must to avoid.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Jessica Lange is awesome in this series. Even though I know what is about to happen in the story line sometimes, I still have to watch it. It gets really good by episode 7. Now, I'm beginning to see some surprises I didn't expect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game in the whole world and I'm getting a new device. I don't want to lose all my progress. Is there any way I can transfer my stuff to the new device?? I've almost unlocked all the characters and have upgraded all my power ups. If there is anyway, please let me know. Thanks.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Have read 4 times!  The characters are well written and believable.  Can't wait for Travis side of the story to comes out!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book tore out my heart. It really brought me back to high school and the things one goes through as an adolescent. Very real and touching.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story was so creative and heartfelt. The writer made it easy to identify with the pain of the characters and was filled with love. Great book!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a great hidden object game.  Every detail...the music, the graphics, the plot and the balance of mini games are all just right.  The full game is well worth the cost (I think it was 2.99).
1439152802|4.0|Although it seemed to take a while to get into it, this book was really good. At first the plot was confusing as it switches from 1941 to the present day, but one gets used to that pretty fast. Although I had wondered about the possibility of the ending - the really BIG secret - it comes off well and as a surprise.

0670024813|1.0|What is the basic idea of this book. It's quite simple. Diamond tries to make the case that primitive peoples in their primitive societies have something valuable to teach us. He tries to make a case for the wisdom of what he calls pre-state peoples.<br /><br />Diamond has been visiting New Guinea for fifty years. It's what he does. Some people ski others play golf. Diamond likes to go bird watching in the mountains of New Guinea. People who have a strong interest in their hobby often express other ideas in terms of their hobby. That's why there are so many sports references in political speech. I personally tend to see all sorts of social and political issues in terms of Italian opera. For Diamond it's New Guinea natives.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book and I recommend that everyone read it. But please read something else about New Guinea too. The US State Department issues warnings to travelers about New Guinea. The main city - Port Moresby - may be the most dangerous city on earth. Men are murdered. Women are raped. Everyone is robbed and assaulted. People are cautioned to only go into the bush with care and a trusted guide. There are web sites and Wikipedia articles showing the rampant gang violence. Diamond as a long time expert can go there but you can't. You'd be killed. New Guinea is a terrible place on the human plane of existence. It seems however to be very fine on the song bird plane.<br /><br />In the first half of the book he tells personal accounts of typical activities in primitive groups and contrasts them with how these events would transpire in a modern nation state like the US. The first example he gives is the story of Gideon and Malo in Chapter Two. In this story Billy, a child, runs out from behind a mini-bus into oncoming traffic. He is killed when Malo's car hits him. Malo who is just an random driver who had no connection with Billy before, immediately vacates the accident scene and goes to the nearest police station.<br /><br />Diamond explains, \\"That's because angry bystanders are likely to drag the offending driver from his car and beat him to death on the spot, even if the accident was the pedestrian's fault\\".<br /><br />These are highland New Guineans. Billy was a low lander. Everyone involved in this traffic accident worries about a blood feud that erupts into a tribal war between the low-landers and the highlanders. Somehow Gideon the employer of Malo is extorted to pay compensation to some people who claim to be Billy's relatives.<br /><br />One of the tribal customs that Diamond cites is the practice of killing someone in retribution for some offense or if that's not convenient to just kill a relative of theirs. It doesn't seem to matter just who you kill anymore than it matters if the person was guilty or innocent. At no point in this story does anyone dispute that Billy ran out into traffic and got himself killed. Yet it is only by the thinnest margin that a general war is averted. No one says to Billy's parents - \\"You should teach your kids to look both ways before they cross the street\\". No one thinks they should put up some traffic lights or stop signs. They just engage in another round of murderous tribal feuding.<br /><br />These are the people from whom we are to learn life lessons?<br /><br />Diamond is obviously deep into the romance of the primitive. A more objective person would see these people as nasty pests. They remind us of the brutal primitive past from which we have emerged.<br /><br />At one point Diamond mentions that there are more than a thousand separate languages in New Guinea. He mentions wistfully that 95% of these languages will die out in this century. That's supposed to be a bad thing? None of these languages are written. They contain no novels or epics. These people have no literature or science. The uttering in these languages are just crude accounts of daily events in the jungle. There are hundreds of words for the same species of tree or monkey.<br/><br />It would have been bad if the world had lost Greek before the Renaissance. That would have meant that we would have lost Aristotle and Plato. There was lots of valuable content written in Greek. But what possible loss is their if we lose these obscure proto-languages used by jungle savages?<br /><br />For that matter, what does it matter if we lose the Yamomano or the !Kung? None of the bands he describes is likely to last longer than this century either. Or if they survive it will only be in something like a zoo. We should prepare for their extinction by studying them. We should have books like this one and movies. They have virtually nothing to teach us but we should garner what there is because they will soon be gone.<br /><br />Diamond is a very silly man. He likes to watch birds. Fine. Me too. He likes to watch forrest natives cavorting in the jungle. Whatever. Jane Goodall liked to observe chimps. Diane Fossey preferred gorillas. But those women didn't lecture us with the lessons we could learn from the apes.<br /><br />Around the year 2000 there were two big best sellers that addressed differences in human accomplishment. One was Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". The other was Lynn and Vanhanen's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\". Diamond's argument in G,G&S is recounted in this book on page 19. Lynn's argument is even simpler. He says nation's with smart people are rich.<br /><br />Currently Diamond is immensely popular with the general public while Lynn is controversial with academics. But Lynn's ideas are likely to endure while Diamond's are already fading. Basically Diamond feels bad about being a member of the dominant culture on earth. He wants everyone to understand that he isn't in any way superior to the savages with whom he congregates. He's eager to demonstrate he's rich and prosperous only because of a series of accidents of history. He's got white guilt bad.<br /><br />And of course he's dead wrong. He is a superior person. He's a fine writer and has produced a number of excellent books. He claimed in G,G&S that some native was more intelligent than he was. We admire humility but no one really takes him seriously. If we believed him we wouldn't buy his books.<br /><br />Lynn's book on the other hand says that Koreans are smart. I have a Samsung tablet. I do not own a single electronic device created in New Guinea. Lynn is factual. Diamond is sentimental. He now wants to explain how his beloved primitives have something just as valuable as electronics. They have jungle justice.<br /><br />That's the first half of the book. The second half is different.  He has big chapters on health. These read like they come from a different book. He rails again salt  and then against sugar. Much the same information is well known now to the literate public. There are many books that say much the same thing. Everything Diamond writes about in these chapters is more or less correct. Salt does give you high blood pressure and sugar does gives you high blood sugar. You should watch them carefully in your diet. Diamond connects these health concerns to the main theme of the book only awkwardly. He essentially writes a sermon on proper nutrition for Westerners and says New Guinea natives don't have these particular health concerns. But of course he's completely wrong. Western whites get diabetes largely because of their diet but forest people who meet up with civilization soon eat the same way and get even worse diabetes. There is a lesson to be learned here but it is not to do as the natives do. We can learn from these people in the same way we can learn from a jungle mushroom that has some useful chemical properties. The natives can be used as objects of study but that does not mean that they can actually teach us anything. They have no schools, no classrooms, no books.<br /><br />Danny Kaye was wrong. In his great novelty song \\"Civilization\\"(Bongo, bongo, bongo I don't want to leave the Congo) he expressed the viewpoint thatwas popular in the forties that forest natives are happy. About the same time there was a song \\"Skokeegan\\" with the lyrics \\"Down in Africa, happy, happy Africa\\". Diamond is part of this older mindset. He warns against romanticizing the natives and their way of life and then does so with a vengeance. The reality is that these pre-state people want to get into the modern world but they are ill equipped to make the transition. They want the peace, order, and prosperity of the modern state. They do not want to stay in the bush and starve and be murdered. All of these tropical peoples make lousy citizens in the modern world. If they stay in their native country they join gangs a who murder and rob. If they go to a developed nation they form gangs who murder and rob.d has produced a number of excellent books.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is only my second Blu-Ray DVD that I own.  I was not really a big fan of the Super Hero's.  But I had taken my 8 year old Nephew to see the movie and was instantly hooked on them.  It is absolutely a fun and entertaining movie one that I have watched more than 5 dozen times already.  Though I have never seen the other individual movies about the Super Hero's but after watching this, I will be watching the others for sure.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, that's how good it is.

B001ANYDAO|3.0|Gladwell is a good writer, a really good writer.  You'll find yourself glued to the prose as he masterfully tells his stories.  But for me the book can be summed up by answering this simple question, &#34;who is most likely to be successful, a child born in Indonesia or one born to a wealthy family in Connecticut&#34;?  The answer is obvious, yet the whole book is built around this point.  Gladwell claims most success can be explained by digging into the successful person's past.  You will, according to Gladwell, find a string of opportunities provided to the successful, all of which &#34;made them successful&#34;.  Obama must have read Outlier before making his &#34;you didn't build your business&#34; speech.  And for me this is where is starts to get dangerous.  Once you can say the money earned by the successful is not as a result of their own endeavors, you can easily make the logical jump and say they don't have the exclusive right to the rewards of their success.  Surely the successful need to &#34;share their success&#34;.  Gladwell doesn't say this explicitly in the book but any intelligent reader can see this as the path the argument is taking (and surely one picked up by the Liberals).  This is simply anti-individualism - it's determinism.<br /><br />Gladwell also introduces his idea of the &#34;10000 hours required for mastery of any skill&#34;.  It's an interesting idea and Gladwell argues it well.  This seems to imply hard work is required to succeed, contradicting the ideas of determinism.  To get around this Gladwell argues the successful people profiled in the book were all &#34;given the **opportunity** for 10000 hours of practice&#34;.  In doing so he once again shifts the emphasis to the &#34;opportunity&#34; and away from the hard work.<br /><br />So what's missing?  For me it's &#34;choice&#34;.  Sure, we all have opportunities which we encounter all through life.  Some of these we pursue, others we choose to ignore.  We do not live deterministic lives.  Our background and genetic makeup are neither necessary for success nor sufficient for success.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Outlier and would recommend it as a great read.  But don't be suckered into thinking you're a victim of your childhood and your ancestors - you're not!  Those things may provide more, or less, opportunities; but in the end you have to make the most of the opportunities which do present themselves (usually in the form of hard work!) and you have to choose who you want to be!!c lives.

0763655465|5.0|I am a Christian Educator and work in a Presbyterian Church. I purchased this book to use one Sunday in worship when the theme of worship was Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. I read the book to the children who came forward for the children's sermon.  George is tempted to misbehave when his owner leaves him at home alone. He gets into a plant and chases the cat and eats a cake. Even though he thinks about it and knows what is right, he still gives in to temptation.  When confronted by his owner with his mistakes George apologizes and says he will try to be better.  Then we see a series of occasions upon which he resists temptation.  The illustrations are charming and the wording simple enough for a preschooler but still funny enough for an older child. George is like all of us.  He wants to &#34;behave&#34; but sometimes falls short.  I highly recommend this book. Though not a religious book, it teaches values that we all can applaud.

B004DARF6A|5.0|I watched & enjoyed this movie as a child & had longed to see it in the years since.<br />Recently I noticed there was an option to stream it. I was initially trepidatious that it's humor had been painted a rose color hue by my childs' eyes & that I would be disappointed by it now.  I had no need. I found it to be even more humorous. I was delighted over it's ability to hold up over all this time.  This movie is still amazingly funny & pertinent to modern day versions of David vs Goliath. It's the lil tramp against &#34;the man&#34;. He proves he can still get ahead & find happiness, while doing it his way.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|As a lifelong inhabitant of northern North Carolina right next to the Virginia line, the moonshine business is a bit of our history. This movie captured my interest at a new take on our legacy. Oh how I loathe what I saw. The town in which the film takes place at is hardly far from my hometown. First of all, moonshine business is not this violent.  This movie is very over the top. The acting it horrid. The story is a disgrace. I would have even been mildly entertained at some blood or action, but sadly it lacked even slightly cool fighting scenes. It has been a while since a film was so bad I just turned it off. In conclusion, STAY AWAY!
B00A8307BG|5.0|If you feel at all disappointed that Trower took a different route with \\"Roots and Branches\\" than with his last two releases--settle down, take a deep breath and give this one time to grow on you.<br /><br />This is first and foremost a blues album, and it's a darn good one at that.  Robin Trower seems to like a certain type of blues, smoky, smoldery, slow and atmospheric.  I have to think that B.B. King would approve.<br /><br />There are a couple of Hendrix-flavored originals thrown in for good measure.  \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" has a descending progression a bit like \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\", and \\"See My Life\\"... well, \\"See My Life\\" is a tour de force full of lyrical references to Trower's past.  It's the best, and it's saved for last.  As for the others, \\"Hound Dog\\" is nice and frisky, and \\"Little Red Rooster\\", \\"The Thrill is Gone\\",\\"That's All Right, Mama\\" and \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" are all superb renditions.  Livingstone Brown plays bass on all but two tracks.<br /><br />I hope that Dan Ackroyd and some of the modern day blues impresarios sit up and take notice of this cd, and put it on the airwaves.  I'm willing to bet it will be one of the best blues albums released in 2013.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Used the older version which gave me the option to color code each event. This new one has only one cole for everything - definitely a downgrade.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Fun and interesting movie.<br /><br />Full of action.<br /><br />Wish it would keep on going and going and going...<br /><br />Cool sound and visual effects.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game, but it keeps telling me to download the update for Rome and every time I click the link on the game it sends me to the Amazon app store to purchase the game which I already own! Where is the right link to get just the updates?
B0070DQZ86|5.0|seen this movie when I was little, was very happy to find it and watch it comfortably at home.<br /><br />Romance and action packed into one Robin Hood movie.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This was ordered for a gift for my nephew. It came to as promised and my nephew did enjoy the movie. I was happy in how fast it came to the house.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just a fun game to play and used to play it with friends and nice to be able to play it when nobody is around to play it in person and making their own rules. lol!
B007X4ECMI|4.0|This DVD arrived as it should have. I did not watch it as it was gift for my nephew.  He had enjoyed it.
B0041KVYIW|5.0|Came perfect and played perfect. The album needs no review. I have two remasters left to complete my collection! Great addition to anyones record collection!!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Yes this movie should have won all the awards as it was a great movie that my wife and I enjoyed.
B000SW16NU|5.0|if you like Troy, 300, etc then this is a must have. Orlando bloom isnt the strongest lead but the supporting cast, and smart plot more than make up for it. PS. this movie is not a documentary, so like most movies based on actual events, liberties were taken with historical accuracy.....but thats why they call it a movie.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|It was a gift for my nephew who enjoyed the movie.  The price was good as well as how quickly it was shipped.
9889979942|5.0|I was recently tasked by a group of doctors to design and construct their new office space on Wilshire Blvd in Beverly Hills, California.  With a very sophisticated and high profile patient base - these doctors wanted only the best for the people they treat.  Every detail was met with careful thought and consideration, including the reading material selection in their very posh but comfortable reception area.  I immediately recalled sitting with a friend of mine who had just received a signed copy of a book from a friend of his who had traveled through China for 2 years, photographing the people along the way.  We sat for hours looking through the book and imagining the epic, and sometimes painful, journey of his adventurous boyhood friend.  I know very few people who could endure such feat, for such a long period of time, that offered little to no creature comforts and a constant threat of going broke before finishing what he had set out to do.  Years later I had the pleasure of meeting Tom Carter, and I assure you, he himself is as brilliant and fascinating as his book.  He is a gorgeous man who stands at least 6'3\\" tall and captivates your attention with his intelligent wit and soulful eyes.  I can only imagine what his subjects were thinking as he rolled into their village with his backpack and camera.  But look into the eyes of his subjects and you will see that they too felt his warmth and compassion for mankind.  You can see by their expressions that they felt safe and were intrigued by his curiosity in them.  So.....it goes without saying...CHINA was one of the first books I ordered for the new office space.  I love the fact that the very size and shape of the book makes it the \\"crown jewel\\" on any stack of coffee table books.  It is always the first book to be picked up, and the hardest book to put down.  If a picture is worth a thousand words then a candid portrait by Tom Carter is worth a thousand looks.  I never tire of the content, and I always see andlearn something new every time I open this 638 page masterpiece.  It has opened my eyes to a culture and sector of people I knew little about. It sparks my interest in learning more, and ignites my desire to adventure out and connect with a world of people who I've not yet met.<br /><br />In closing, it would be impossible for me to pick my favorite page, portrait, or landscape shot, but every bit as heart warming as the photographic content of his book is Carter's tribute to his travel partner and inspiration.  It's hard to believe that any woman so perfectly sculpted and stunningly beautiful could be so tough.  It's wonderful to know that her courageous spirit, and undying support, wasn't lost on her relentless photographer friend.  She persevered on a journey to show Carter that her people are his people too.  It should come as no surprise that after 2 years of traveling thru 33 distinct regions, and photographing 56 different ethnic groups, thru weather and lodging conditions that would make the best of us book the first flight home, that she became the wife of the man who set out connect the \\"East\\" with the \\"West\\" through the lens of his camera.  Equally as exciting is that  within the last year they embarked on an even more incredible journey together---- parenthood.<br /><br />It is my sincere hope that my review with inspire readers to treat themselves to a photographic  adventure and labor of love.  CHINA will far exceed your expectations of adding the perfect book to your coffee table collection.  I look forward to seeing what Tom Carter publishes next.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzel Washington was perfect for the role. I enjoyed the movie and thought it should be up there for an Oscar.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Fast and easy to get the information you want. It is much better than the Weather channel sight I used to use.
B005VTGB0S|5.0|I bought an Apple I pad for the first time recently.  I needed a cover and found Amazon Basic to be a good value.
B008Y2X78S|5.0|Nucky is my hero. Steve Buscemi is perfect for this role. One of my must watch series along with Dexter and Homeland. Amazon has a good delivery system.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the walking dead, and season 3 is great, it feels like there is a lot more action compared to season 2, I read people were concerned that some of the staff left the show, but the show hasn't lost any momentum, I look forward to this show every week!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I have trouble trying to update it to rome so I cant play the new one can I get some help?
0345529057|5.0|We love Game of Thrones, and can't get enough of it, so I thought I would get the books too.  This box set was cheap and comes with a cardboard case to hold all the books, great deal!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book get omg!!!!! Read the rest of the series please you have to if you don't I will go mad
B004P4S4NM|4.0|I loved this album.  It's soulful and fun to listen to.  &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34; stands out as my favorite track.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|By far the best Dragon game out there. It is so much fun and has lots of things to do besides breeding. You can race with the dragon racetrack or fight in the colossium. It is so much easier to earn money and level up then some of the other dragon games. I highly recommend it!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|This alblum is pleasant enough, but doesn't have the bite and sting of most of his previous CD's, and at times, the musical background overwhelms his voice.  Not one song really \\"jumps\\" out - reminds me a bit of elevator music - this CD does NOT do him justice.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|No aliens...just a lot of space engineering drama that was enjoyable reading.  Couldn't put it down till I read the whole thing.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The worst song is Thrift Shop and I dont mean that in a bad way. Highly recommend the whole album.
B0000AC8LR|5.0|This movie is definitely different than others you might have seen. It is a little weird, but that's what makes it unique. I love it because it gets you thinking
B001E9641K|5.0|I received this game yesterday, and my wife and I have so far played it only once. However, we already love it! This is the first of the Ticket to Ride games that either of us has played, but we decided to get this version as I read it is better for less players (being limited to only 3) and we would often be playing with only the two of us. As we are also moving to Norway later this year that made this version the logical choice, as I even came across an unrelated online review where someone had learned their geography of Scandinavia from this game. That clinched the deal!<br /><br />The gameplay so very easy to learn that after only one game my wife and I understand it entirely. The rules themselves are only four pages long, including instructional diagrams! The first game lasted about an hour (with my wife defeating me!) and we are looking forward to another. Setup was easy, and the instructions even include a diagram for where to lay the cards and pieces around the board, thus leaving nothing to guesswork. But while the gameplay is easy to learn, the strategy appears to give this game significant replayability, as you are constantly guessing which cities your opponent(s) is trying to connect and you do not know the answer until the game ends.<br /><br />Also, unlike some other games which can skimp on pieces, this game even came with extra pieces in case you lose some (40 train carriages of each colour are needed to play, while it came with 45 where the extra 5 are referred to in the rules as spares).<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with our purchase and recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, easy to learn, and enjoyable game!
B003UESJF6|5.0|Hilarious animated film. Great for adults, teens, and children. I love the animation and the comedy is absolutely hilarious. My family and I can't help but quote the movie all the time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really a great game. its a good way to pass time. my lil sis loves it... it keeps her entertained for a good while!!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I love this movie. One of my favorites. Gets you thinking. Wonderful actors, and captures emotion. Some parts of the movie are so heart-wrenching.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids love playing this game and collecting the coins to buy all the hoverboards. The addition of the new cities is awesome.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|It was actual a pretty goo movie about getting revenge the old fashion way. The sniper action was actual ok.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Definitely a page-turner and if you want a quick read you'll enjoy this book! Already lent it to my mom as a recommended read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|First time for me to read Sparks.  As an attorney the way he develos the story around spousal abuse is very realistic.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Read this for book club. I liked it in the child's voice brought some innocence into the telling of horrible things.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have several friends that love to listen to Josh Groban so I preordered two and when hey came in I had to order two more.  Great CD
B006TLFPKO|5.0|this is not the kind of film I would normally watch.  vampires?  however; the story line is captivating.  i was hooked from the first film.
B009IF8CH6|2.0|In my opinion, the show is just declining. I know viewers have never been higher, but the soul of the show is just gone at this point. All I hear anymore is the laugh track.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|the courage and determination of one individual changed the outcome of 6 lives and that will always have my attention.  the fact that it was put on film so realistically makes for a perfect movie.
B00846REIS|2.0|I have found this book to be half way similiar to Fify Shades of Grey, this books attempts to read almost exactly the same, but likes orginality.  However Bare to You didn't even come close to Fifty Shades of Grey. The story line is too quick and the ending is missing. I read the complete series of FSoG, which took me 6 days to read.  I could seems to put it down, because it was well written and had an excellent story line. With Bared to You, I have to force myself to read it, thinking where is this story line going, surely it will get better, and it to be wasted my time. I was intrigued to see just how ridiculous Bared to You would get and sadly I was not disappointed. I would rather re-read FSoG series again, before I pick the next sequel to Bared to You.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|honestly, i would watch anything by daniel craig!  nonetheless, i liked it.  true to bond films, this movie keeps you engaged from the beginning.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I give it a four because I am new to series and don't yet know about it's staying power to keep me interested. It does have some great characters and extremely talented actors.
0062082353|5.0|Loved the book. I know others helped Chris but it was an extremely easy read, because I'm such a lousy reader, I read it in 2 days, hey but I was on vacation in Cancun...<br />I'm prejudiced because I'm a Navy veteran, a North Texan and old enough to be Chris's dad. So I claim him and his soul. If you aren't military you might not understand the way we think. I get it.<br />Chris's book is GREAT. Love you man. RIP.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The songs keep going through my head night and day.<br />Such a wonderful movie, we need more like this for generations to come!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|HOW YA DOIN\\" ?<br />Far out man!! Love it Joe. Rock lives. And it always will with Joe Walsh (Midnight Moodies)&(Tomorrow)<br />Thanks Joe. Got any gum?<br />Enjoying your analog man dude thanks thanks thanks
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Who could not be thrilled with new music from Josh<br />He puts a smile on your face and makes you happy inside and out!
B0002XNT0I|5.0|Incomparable rendering - Hanks and Washington uncovered the truth about how our prejudices bind our souls and deprive us of each others gifts.
1587613379|5.0|My wife and I read this book together. It is really a great read. Terms are explained and there are excercizes to help you figure out if polyamory is for you. It is a beginners introduction into the life of open relationships. The chapter my wife and I found especially helpfull was the \\"Unlearning Jealousy\\" chapter which transcends far past romantic relationships. No matter what you decide in the end, it is truely an insight into the mind of another lifestyle.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read it in high school and enjoyed it more this time around.  Hugo was great at character development and felt like you were back in revolutionary France while reading the book.  It was a love story; an adventure and a history lesson a rolled into one great story.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I think he sounds great and Count Basie and the Orchestra are superb.  A must have for the true fans of our great treasure from Hoboken.
B002IR3PSC|4.0|I have added only 4 Stars, because the first part of the video was only a Audio Sequence.<br />But the Music is TOP
B00AHXIC50|4.0|A couple of really good selections.  After seeing them on Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago, it is obvious the energy of the live show is impossible to capture on recordings.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This calculator is great for your everyday adding, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I gave a 4 star only because it doesn't have a percentage & I use that slot.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Very few people I know like this, but I really enjoy everytime I watch. There isn't a lot of talking in the beggining, you just understand whats going on from the scenes.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I really do enjoy this but if your just learning to play it may be a little frustrating only because of the free song choices, but you can download (paid) others. There is 3 levels easy (slow), average, advanced (fast) on each peace .Reason I gave 4stars was only because of the song choices, other than that it's great even the keys are marked.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The DVD are of good quality and even though its not the favorite of the three seasons, I enjoyed it greatly.
B0094KTC6K|5.0|This starts out a little slow, but I'm interested in chimpanzee so it was very informational to. It's more toward a documentary, but I really enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun and gives responsibility<br />love love love love love love love download download download download<br />must play you will LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I like having the cover and I really like that I can easily plugged it in to be charged. The kindle sits secure in the case.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Love the idea of having Uno and its waterproof!!!<br /><br />Very convinient as all the cards fit perfecty on the hook that is provided.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|The game was fun at first, but then after a few times I became bored with it. Maybe they could change the size to create more challenge for the player.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like this app cause talks hahaha and that it monitor everything like music and Internet usages great app guys
B0091THRCU|1.0|i saw some on amazon for cheaper on that this one is 10 bucks it should work better than the other ones. i got it in a few days and i was excited when i tried to slip in the iphone it would take all the strength i had in me. When i finally got it in i tried to slip it out and when i would pull on the strap up it wouldnt push the phone up. Worst mistake was buying from them. Im not even going to bother trying to get it exchanged or get my money back its not worth it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was a good book to read and I enjoyed the action that was going on by how he was telling
B004OR199G|5.0|Great read, funny and inspirational. This book will make you think about what you put into your body.....and makes you want to make better eating choices for yourself. A must have !!!!
B000FCKPHG|5.0|As a student of positive psychology and someone who works to help people reach their maximum potential I have found this book very enlightening.  I am always helping people to find that they have more choices than they have previously believed.  This book provides a great framework, and a new vocabulary, for having this conversation with clients. The only disappointment was the last chapter which I hoped would be a little more practical in nature.  Nevertheless, a great, quick read.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I wish the man had written it himself instead of coming from Mr. Harden, but it was still a thrill ride from start to finish. Makes you want to find out more about how he is doing now in the modern world.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Received in great condition. Love the different versions. Watched all in a Blade Runner marathon just to see the differences.  Some subtle, some not so much.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|For anyone who's thought more than they've spoken.<br />A book about an observer who has had more pain in his life than meets the eye.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Good inside look as to what makes a SEAL tick. Also showed the struggle between God, family, and county. If you are looking for an easy read about one of the many brave men that defended our freedoms this is a good one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one great game.  It is so much better than the original Temple Run.  The graphics are great and I especially like the zip lines and the mining carts.  If you like the original Temple Run you're gonna love this one.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is fun easy game to pass time if you like puzzles.There are quite a few different puzzles to do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Again another wonderful season at Downton Abbey.  I am always disappointed when the season is over.  Quite the unexpected turn of events at the end of this year.  Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy period pieces.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book brings back reach in a way just like the video game it had me wanting more from each chapter day or night
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow! What can I say? This was an excellent trilogy. It is not what people think. It takes on many forms.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Perfect in every way just like always Suzanne Collins delivers yet another book that makes every book that isn't in the series look like trash
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best keyboard I've used. If you have only used the factory standard key board and wonder how much better it could be, try the trial version. You won't be disappointed.
B00190OHD6|4.0|Sweet movie; HIllary is believable and good as her character, and Gerard shows his tender, sweet side, while staying as sexy as ever.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Downloaded the Kindle version and liked it so much, that did same on my Android smartphone (RAZR Max); both apps work fine.  AccuWeather has all the information I need (daily forecast, hourly predictions, and 10 day forecast) in an intuitive easy to navigate set-up.  It allows you to save a total of 10 locations so you can tell in a hurry how's the weather at distant family members location.  Radar animations load up fast and cloud movements are smooth.  Both local forecast and other available videos play fine.  The free version has a small non-intrusive add banner on top that does not interfere while viewing pages.  Highly recommended!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The Kindle Fire version of this book includes a rather lengthy explanation about the Jack Reacher genesis from the author.  A foreigner writing a first person book about an American is a tough task to begin with, but when you add a clear lack of knowledge of firearms and tactics, it's almost painful.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - this is a great thriller.  The story is plausible and fun to follow along with, but the glaring technical errors are almost unrecoverable.  Most distracting is Mr. Child's confusion with regard to the differences between automatic and semi-automatic weapons.  In his books, Mr. Child seems to think that any weapon not classified as a revolver is therefore an automatic.<br /><br />This mistake is made over and over (including in the excerpt from the second Jack Reacher book).  There are also some blatant inaccuracies with the ballistics of shotguns (and their dispersion patterns).  This lack of knowledge extends to hand to hand combat scenes.<br /><br />If you're looking for accuracy, or you're a gun enthusiast, this isn't your series.  This is more of a popcorn thriller than actual substance (Like Brad Thor's Scot Harvath series, for example).  Can't expect too much from a British sitcom writer.  At least it's entertaining.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|So fun!<br />Beautiful graphics. Challenging but not to hard. The story line pulls you in and keeps you very engaged all the way to the end.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|i found some of the information in this book to be helpful but still had some issues in formatting, none of which seemed to resolve itself til i found information elsewhere about general formatting for Ebooks.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|For a old Star Trek fan this movie was great, seeing Spock again brought back so many memories, can't wait to see the new movie
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Have read this many times each time I still enjoy it. At one point I thought I gave it away just to buy another copy, lo and behold it was in my mothers attic. When you need to read it you need to read it.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|this album in the vinyl version and played it forever, now i purchased it in the cd form and play it all the time without hearing the needle scratch the surface, of course the music itself is extraordinay, i can never get enough of it, listen to it on a good pair of headphones and experience all the nuances.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|Album has a nice throw back to the 80s with new pop feel to the Tegan and Sarah discography. The songs are fun listen to, but they also all sound very similar. If you like one song then your bound to like the rest but don't count on diversity. Overall great for hipsters, 80s lovers, and fans of the digital alternative genre.
B00007M5CO|5.0|This album is great for people who like nuevo tango, there are many intersting songs on it and when i play it during my parties my friends really enjoy dancing to it. candles, wine and this album, very good combination.
B004QWKIYQ|5.0|I just absolutely love this album. The music is so upbeat and everyone that hears it wants a copy.Great album
B000002LCI|5.0|I had purchased this album in the vinyl form when it came out in the 80s, i lost it after moving, now i bought it in the cd form and it still sounds as good as it did many years ago, for me this music has not gotten old, i still listen to it all the time, loud.
B0091LS07E|5.0|great album,,,,enjoy lt every time I play it. one of keys best  albums yet, I highly recommend it to all
034580404X|3.0|About the story:<br />The main female character, Ana, is a naïve college graduate, which her language shows all too well, and perhaps goes too far. She reminds me of myself in high school, but perhaps even more naïve, which is hard to imagine of someone, who lived through college.<br /><br />The main male character, Gray, is messed up and an not very nice. No, I do not mean his kink side. He breaks her limits at least twice in the first book and it is basically the same freaking limit, impact punishment/play and it does not seem gentle at least to her. Who makes same mistake and then wonder why she leaves? Then knowing she has a problem with his (let's go with) ex, continually put her in situations where she is expected to interact, even, outside of family functions, causing her so much stress every time, yet claiming she is much more than his other submissives.<br /><br />The books quality itself:<br />The paper is what you would expect from a mass production paper back. I was impressed by the printing, which I am always worried about with paperbacks. The printing was clear and dark, so it stuck out from the darker paper that it was printed on.<br /><br />Side note:<br />Before you participate in kink, I suggest you do some research, outside of fantasy. Remember fantasy is not real life. Sadly, I have heard of people expecting real life to be like the book, but only like the good portions.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is the BEST new TV series I've seen in a very long while!!!! It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat! Love it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|very enjoyable, good graphics, many levels and variety of challenges.  Runs well on my Kindle. you will like it! and the price is right.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Starts off a little slow with a small number of tiles but then builds up. Provides hints but try not to use them.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a great book. I shouldn't have to tell you how good this is, just read it. You'll thank me.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Very addictive is the British soap opera. Can't wait for next season. So glad we purchased this and will watch it again soon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My sister was the one who turned me on to Downton Abbey and now I can't get enough!  I never though I could be so emotionally tied to a show!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game but there are so many files to go into at least on my kindle fire. Maybe combine some or do something the indicators for the journal is kinda awkward to understand also
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This is not my preferred genre but an author I follow (and love) on twitter tweeted that it was on sale a few weeks back and that she loved it. That was enough to sell me.<br /><br />It was a wonderful book. I fell in love with all the characters, foibles and all. I am Anna so that helped. Once I hit 25% I didn't want to put it down and didn't want to stop thinking about it when it was over.<br /><br />It leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside at the end and that's important to me. Loved the book.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love all of Bruno Mars' songs. But this album is even better than the last! I would buy all of his albums!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game use to be bad but now it is the best odee plz keep on updating this and never stop thank u
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game and entertainment for the whole family.  Good for the waiting room at the doctor's office or being held up in traffic.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|played it for a while it was amazing and then it just pooped the bed allover it would quit and go back to the main screen
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just like the other Angry Bird games. it's hard the stop playing. The music and the birds talking and chriping are great
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I keep hoping for one that was as good as Casino Royale, but as of yet, no luck.  This one is definitely better than the last one, though!
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Picked up this album after hearing much hype, both positive and negative, and after hearing several of the songs on KEXP here in Seattle.  This music caught my ear because it made me feel good.  I find the song &#34;Same Love&#34; to be incredibly moving and timely.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It's this kind of ignorant trash that sets feminism back decades. Women who defend this book are, however unwittingly, participating in some of the most blatant misogyny I've ever witnessed, giving the impression that some women enjoy being debased, abused, and controlled (outside of a consensual Dom/sub relationship). This is not a book about BDSM, this is a book about one sick, abusive man and his obsession with a young, naive invertebrate. It's a book about a girl who has absolutely no sense of self, who sacrifices any pretense of individuality in order to hold onto a man who doesn't even show her the faintest glimmer of respect. It's about two attention-starved individuals with the emotional maturity of toilet paper convincing themselves that their relationship is 'like, the best thing ever, OMG'. It's trite, insulting, and dangerous. I fear for any impressionable young women who read this and think that this is how an ideal relationship should operate. If nothing else, it should be issued as a guidebook to mothers around the world to show their daughters the kind of man to avoid at all costs. This book does good men (and indeed, all of humanity) a disservice.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book. I finished it in about 2-days. I cab't wait to get started on reading additional Gillian Flynn novels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved it, all except the ending.Why did they have to go that way? I hope they do a season 4.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have ever read! Couldn't stop reading it! Amazing description! Felt like I was there! I definitely recommend!
B008J34466|1.0|At 51, I feel I can listen to whatever the hell I want to listen to. So, when I was excited to get the new Pink CD, I didn;t realize they set me to wal mart, who by the way ,decides what you can and cannot hear, geesh, I am adult, can I at least have a choice? So, now I have a useless cd with no curse words in it, then had to buy another that had the curse words in it. F this Amazon!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I love anything with Keira Knightly, although the direction of this movie is very different. If you like any of the old versions, you will be surprised by this one!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett never disappoints. Fall of Giants brings the turmoil of the first world war to your doorstep while the characters are brought to life struggling for a better future.<br /><br />.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|My grandchildren loved it and have watched it over and over again.  Myself, I like the music but have watched the movie with them.  Would recommend it for all children to see.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|YOU PEOPLE BETTER LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO GET MORE TIME ON IT!!!!! :) ALL U DO IS WHEN IT SAYS U HAVE FINISHED THE DEMO THEN UJINSTALL IT THEN INSTALL IT AGAIN AND U GET MORE TIME TO PLAY EVEN THOUGH U LOSE UR WORLDS
B0090X4GLW|4.0|If you liked the music in the movie you'll really enjoy the CD.  However, there are some songs they did in the movie that I really liked that didn't make it to the CD.  I also wish some of the songs were a little longer.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|4.5 is more like it.<br />After exploring Wilson's solo career, beginning with '[[ASIN:B001O2ZW1A Insurgentes (CD & DVD)]],' I was quite hopeful. That album was a shift from what I had come to know in Porcupine Tree, but it was still very interesting and engaged me for quite some time. Once I learned that the next solo album, '[[ASIN:B0058WFO1K Grace for Drowning]],' would boast itself as a double album I was ecstatic. It finally arrived, however, and I found myself disappointed by what was there. I wrote another review on that particular album, so I won't delve into it here. And now we have 'The Raven that Refused to Sing (and other stories).'This was a very welcome digression from the past.<br /><br />I previously listened to the songs that were made available by Wilson from this album in hopes of getting a fair idea of what to expect before purchasing; I did not want to have another 'Grace for Drowning' experience. So I listened to 'Luminol' from the mailing list and the title track from the accompanying video and found that this was nothing like the previous two albums. So I took a gamble and purchased the record. Thankfully this turned out to be a good decision.<br /><br />I will admit that I have never been fully keen on Steven's influences and always wonder what could be next. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of '[[ASIN:B007DJUO8O Storm Corrosion]]' and am now happy to see that some of that same influence spilled over to this record. 'The Raven...' has a quality 'prog' feel to the whole record. And the storytelling stands very well against the song structure  of the album. The musicians play very well together and blend each of their own styles very well. Wilson's vocal work is also some of his best, straying from previous releases in style.<br /><br />Overall this record is quality from start to finish. I personally hold it higher than the previous two albums and will say that this is currently Wilson's high point in his solo career. It's not as traditonal Wilson as was 'Insurgentes,' nor was it as experimental as was 'Grace for Drowning,' but it stands on its own as a shining example of where musical progression can take an artist. It is haunting, it is sentimental, it is melolancholy, it is beautiful, and it is purely Wilson's flare of contemporary progressive rock. I hope you enjoy this album as much as I have. It has been a long time since I have wanted to listen to an album immediately after the first listen (unless for mere curiosity to what I thought of it), so this album has come as quite a shock and delight.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Really if I had a 1.5 option that would be my rating for Hopeless. And I am really sorry to say that due to the fact I actually liked the first 75% of the book. I got this book after seeing all the 5 star reviews on Amazon and Goodreads. I have to wonder what is the age demographic.<br /><br />Sky's adventure from homeschooling to real life high school is a great storyline. The relationship between her and her bestie are humorous and loving. When Holder comes into the picture I liked the mystery and teenage angst that was going on. Real, human and very much a self discovery. It was all going along great even with this unraveling abusive back story going on. You had me invested in these people and their relationship.<br /><br />But when the truth and the \\"real issues\\" surfaced..... I hate to say it but..... I call BULL$#*t.<br />There were just too many unrealistic responses to what should have taken, I feel, more time to handles and come to terms with.<br /><br />*****SPOILER******<br /><br />There is NO WAY after finding out what Sky finds out that this is a realistic response. Nope, nuh uh, no way. There is no way a cop would just lay down his guns outside his home and turn his back and walk in without a care. There is no way a young girl would learn and remember a horrible ongoing rape/rapes and then cozy up to him to get more information. Oh and the next day we are all hunky dory after watching a man kill himself???? No. You had me then you jumped the shark.<br /><br />It is too bad because I truly liked the Hopeless in the beginning and wish the author would have stayed in keeping with character.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book!  I read it on our cruise because I want to see the movie.  I will definately read more by Nicolas Sparks!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent production. Really holds our attention. Story line is easy to follow. So much intrigue with all the main cast of characters.
1594203334|5.0|Love, love, love this book! With all the &#34;parenting style&#34; books and trends out there, this one helps me stay grounded and confident in my ability to just do what I think is best. We don't want to follow a book to raise our kids. We had great parents and great childhoods. We can figure it out.<br /><br />I read this book in three days. I think I want to read it again now... :)

0880796863|4.0|I have seen the Rider Waite printed in a few different color schemes and what disappointed me about this particular one is some of the coloring is so dull you miss some of the symbolism in the cards (hard to see/bleeds together). A few examples of this is the 7 of Cups it's hard to determine what is in the cups, especially the central arms wide open figure. A lot of the cards with water in the background can be lost because the water blends in with the rest of the image. Some may find this particular print beautiful but I would steer any new to tarot student away from it due the difficulty of being able to see the small details in the cards that really give symbolism and meaning to them. This is a review of this print only and not Rider Waite in general. I still highly recommend the Rider Waite as a learners or a primary deck. And the 4th store was given to this print mainly because of the nice quality box it comes in as well as the beautiful print on the back of the cards.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I wasn't't going to watch this Batman movie, finding the last couple to dark and stressful. But my husband wanted to watch it, and so, here I am. What I loved about this movie was the story of humility and redemption played out so seamlessly from the last movie, The Dark Knight, you'd almost never know there were four years between filming them. Christian Bale was, for once, restrained and excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Until this movie, he just didn't do it right for me. But his fall from grace and resulting brokenness (literally) was some of his best acting.<br /><br />I loved Anne Hathaway as Cat Woman. She played her just right, not overly sexy, more scrappy and pulled in two directions - will she be the bad guy, or will she end up showing she can be redeemed? Marion Cotillard is mesmerizing as Miranda, good friend of Bruce Wayne and supporter of Batman. I did not recognize one of my faves, Tom Hardy as evil as it gets, Bane, what an amazing performance from this gifted actor. And where were the Oscar people when this movie came out? Just shows how divided and out of touch Hollywood has become with us regular people in recent years. This movie deserved recognition!<br /><br />I won't put any spoilers in here, but let me just say how much I enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the loyal cop, Blake. As always, Michael Caine turned in a difficult performance with his usual brilliance as Alfred, and Gary Oldman as well as Commissioner Gordon. Simply superb performances all around. But it was the story that was the hero in this movie. It could have followed a safer path, but chose a very difficult one, one instead. And for that, I gave this movie 5 stars.<br /><br />The franchise is successfully rebooted in a spectacular way (cue the fireworks) and I now am looking forward to the next movie, if there is one (not in the know all things Batman movies). If you haven't seen this one, definitely worth watching. It helps to have seen The Dark Knight first, though. I highly recommend this movie!commend this movie!

B0018QOIXU|5.0|I recently discovered Adele. I like her second album better, but I hope to get all her recordings!  I can't get enough of her amazing songs and her beautiful voice.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a great game. Despite what others have said, it was not confusing or hard to follow. I played the expert level. It was challenging, but not impossible. The hints are there if you need them. The story line was creepy, but I love that part of these games. The hidden objects were easy to see and it has the zoom in feature. It played longer than most games so you get your money's worth. However, if you are afraid of clowns, don't play it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have the CD, which comes with free mp3. I haven't even opened the CD yet. What a great deal. If I had to pick only one album for the past five years, this would be the one:-)

B0051RP4DA|4.0|If you like &#34;Into the Wild&#34; it's fairly similar in a Ukelele kind of way. I want to like it a little more than I actually do like it, but it's a good addition to the music library.
B005Q1W10A|3.0|The 1st DVD worked perfectly - the 2nd DVD kept stopping in the middle of a scene and I had to start all over again or try to find which scene it stopped - kept this up thru the whole 2nd DVD. The 3rd DVD only had 1 stop, but after starting over, worked fine.<br />I hesitate to buy Season 3, when available! Do not want to encounter this aggravation!

B002ZHKZEC|2.0|Oh man. First off, don't blame David Tennant for the atrocity that is the specials. His performances have never been less than astounding, and even though before these specials he's had a few less then stellar scripts, he does a great job given what he had to work with. With Whovians, you either love Russell T. Davies or Steven Moffat, you're not allowed to like both. Thing is, I do like both (at least only for the seasons of Doctor Who, not that Torchwood garbage), and Davies even turned in the best episode of Tennant's tenure: &#34;Midnight&#34;, the psychodrama that takes place on a train. So what exactly happened with these specials? Especially as series 4 was so good and maybe even best yet?<br /><br />I guess you can't place the blame entirely on Davies either. He wanted to leave at series 4's end, but they wanted more out of him, so these &#34;specials&#34; (and I use that word loosely) were done as a compromise. But man, by the time &#34;The End of Time&#34; Part 2 was over, I was glad he was gone, and even though I'm only a new Whovian (I started with Eccleston at the beginning of January and am now entirely caught up), I can already say that Moffat runs circles around him in terms of scripts. Sure, Moffat can be a tad pretentious at times (if just slightly, it rarely ever shows), I'd take pretentious over the lowest common denominator scripts that Davies provided for thes specials.<br /><br />There are four specials here, and only one of them I enjoyed: &#34;The Waters of Mars&#34;. That episode at times recalls &#34;Midnight&#34;; Davies' good eye for suspense is front in center and at times the episode is ever so pretty looking. Yep, I'm shallow like that. But the Doctor ends up on Mars and because he read it on TARDIS-Wikipedia or something that effect, he's in danger of water-spewing zombies created by a virus. It's actually worth watching in its entirety; even though the main conflict ends too quickly. &#34;Planet of the Dead&#34; is ever- so DULL. I literally can't remember what happened in the episode, except a desert planet with a bunch of people trapped on a bus with The Doctor. Alright, skip to the last ten minutes. I remember them quite well. &#34;The Next Doctor&#34; is half good; it takes place in Victorian London, with some guy considered to be &#34;the next doctor&#34;. But don't get your hopes up. It's a cop-out; it's just some guy who thinks he's The Doctor. Watch the first half, then make up your own second half.<br /><br />And then the two-part &#34;End of Time&#34;, SKIP BOTH OF THEM. Alright, I'm being a little dramatic there; they're mostly crap, and there's nothing you need to know until the last ten minutes of the episode, where The Doctor regenerates. Some tear-jerking acting by Tennant in that scene, and a hilarious and heartwarming introduction to the ever so charming and suave Eleventh Doctor played by Matt Smith. But other than that, well, NOTHING HAPPENS. Some ridiculous plot involving a cult revivng The Master, The Master turning everyone into clones of him, some cactus race, banging drums or whatever. Oh, and The Doctor turns into some emo kid who spends the whole second episode bitching and whining and angsting. There is literally a scene where he tries to kill himself, but fails, and breaks down in an over-the-top crying fit. Again, not Tennant's fault. But The Doctor constantly says whiny and emo things like &#34;Time Lords' lifespans are too long!!!!&#34;. Please, Doctor. Spare us the theatrics, go start your own emo band.<br /><br />Overall, there's one of four specials that is worth watching. The other four range from meh to garbage, and either way, Tennant (and the tenth doctor) deserved a better bow-out. Thanks to these specials, while the Tenth is still my favourite Doctor, I'm glad he's gone, in fact I'm really enjoying Smith as Doctor Eleven, who is the most charming, suave and upbeat Doctor yet (though he was rather mean and condescending in the first few episodes). Moffatseems to be really nailing it and the series has taken an upward flight in terms of quality. Otherwise, skp these specials. There is nothing you need to know in The End of Time except for The Doctor regenerates.<br /><br />Though, to be fair, at least it's better than Torchwood.seems to be really nailing it and the series has taken an upward flight in terms of quality.

B00006EXDM|5.0|The best of the best!  This album keeps you on your feet.  You just cannot help dancing and singing along.  A definate upper!
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|Helloween is back with their follow up to the very heavy 7 Sinners.  This album won't blow out your ears the same way their last album did, but Straight Out Of Hell, especially the title track, are very solid metal songs, that will stick with you long after the songs are over.  Helloween has mastered the art of writing catchy songs, and Straight Out Of Hell is no exception.<br /><br />I prefer the bonus track version of Burning Sun.  World of War, Far From the Stars, and a surprise favorite, Years are the other standout tracks on this album.  At 15 songs, this is a bit longer than most of their other CDs, Legacy notwithstanding.<br /><br />But back to the music itself.  Deris' voice hasn't shown any aging (a big concern as vocalists like Bruce Dickinson just can't hit the same notes they did 20 years ago).  The guitar work is also on par with any recent Helloween standard.  Fans won't be disappointed!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is everything a game should be. It's just so addictive...and because the company updates it regularly, it stays interesting! I love being able to sing the praises of a good product.
B00821OX98|5.0|One of the downsides of having the entire season at your disposal is gettng to the end of the series and having to wait for the next season to be posted....

B0036TGSJ4|5.0|If you haven't seen Easy A, just watch it already!  Emma Stone is adorable and up to the task of portraying her character, who gets trapped in a tangle of well-meaning lies.  Also stars the coolest parents this side of George and Lorraine McFly.  No sex/nudity or violence, although there is some language and conversations about sexual matters.
B0035WTJFW|5.0|As with Blade Runner, both based on Philip Dick scifi proposals, excelent! Bluray resulted to be the best format to get involved in created scenarios.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|This is a fascinating collection of the well written fictional stories told of Mr Holmes adventures.<br />I am only 50% through reading the many stories contained in this edition and whilst I may go off and read another author for a change of style, I always come back to the Sherlock Holmes collection.<br />Great variety of cases and good value for money.<br />Ron Davenport
B0063IH60K|5.0|Exactly what you'd expect from a solitare app. Glitch and virus free with one easily dismissed add before each hand. Has a really nice feature allowing you to replay hands with the cards dealt the same exact way, in case you feel you made a wrong turn along the way.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Twisted novel, lots of excitement and turns. The story was really crazy however the ending STUNK!<br />Brilliantly written until the end!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|First I have to say that I've seen much worse movies in the past, so this was horrible, but it did lack something.  The premise was interesting enough and if they would have explored the lore behind the entity and the images it might have worked.  I had the film figured out way before the final scene.  I think anyone who has watched enough horror movies will probably get it.  There was a definite creepiness to the whole super 8 film thing, but just not enough to make me really get scared by this movie.  The scenes with the husband and wife where way to melodramatic and they just didn't deliver on the spooks when they had apple opportunity.  If you have money to blow and time to kill go ahead and watch, but don't expect too much.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I enjoyed listening to this CD, but you have to be in the mood for the techno and turn it up LOUD! Great music, great songs with great lyrics!
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I've been a fan of Porcupine Tree for many years, though I only got seriously into their music in 2011 when I saw Steven Wilson's solo concert for \\"Grace for Drowning.\\" I've been looking forward to this album for months and I'm overjoyed to have it in my hands. I had high expectations, and \\"The Raven That Refused to Sing (and other stories)\\" surpassed them. The songs are all based off of folk tales and myths, and I'm interested to look up what they've been based off of.<br /><br />Song by song:<br /><br />Luminol: This might be my favorite on the disc, though it's hard to pick. This is a 12 minute, mostly-instrumental song that blows me away. Sometimes when bands create long songs, they tend to drag on--not so for Steven Wilson. This song keeps you captivated until the end and begs you for a replay. The beat of the drums make it a lot of fun to drive to, also.<br /><br />Drive Home: A beautifully melancholy song. It's one of those sadder sounding songs that doesn't make you feel depressed, but instead makes me feel an almost hopeful kind of longing. I don't like this song AS much as some others on the album, but I do still love it. Good to listen to when you're in a calm mood.<br /><br />The Holy Drinker: This is the one song on the album that's taking a little while to grow on me. I still like it, but not as much as the other songs yet. However, I know from experience with listening to Porcupine Tree/Steven Wilson that oftentimes songs that don't catch your ear at first become your favorites. So, we'll see! The song is heavier than Drive Home, and has a driving force behind it. Definitely going to be a headbanger at concerts. Even with a heavier instrumentation to it than the other songs on the album (though Luminol is heavier as well), it still fits in perfectly with the mood and feel of the album as a whole.<br /><br />The Pin Drop: Okay, maybe THIS is my favorite song on the album currently. At 5 minutes long, it's also the shortest. It's an amazingly beautiful,longing, melodic song. At the chorus, as he sings \\"I tried to be the way that he wanted me to be/I did not hear the pin drop down/I did not hear my heart\\" it just sounds absolutely perfect. I could listen to this song forever.<br /><br />The Watchmaker: The intro to this song reminds me of the style of \\"Grace for Drowning\\" songs. Distant and flowing. The lyrics to this song are heartfelt and bittersweet. I'd especially love to see the stories this is based off of. \\"I never really loved you but I'll miss you anyway/You were just meant to be temporary while I waited for gold/We filled up the years and I found that/I liked having someone to hold.\\" Absolutely lovely flute (?) in this song as well.<br /><br />The Raven That Refused to Sing: Ah, this song. Such a perfect song. If you haven't seen the music video for it, I HIGHLY recommend it. It brought tears to my eyes. This song is very atmospheric and gentle in a dark way, to my ears. Listening to it while remembering the video just makes it even more heartrending (in a good way!) I can tell this will be a song that I'll be able to listen to a hundred times without getting tired of it.<br /><br />All in all, this album is a 1000/1000 for me. I couldn't have asked for a better group of songs. I'm going to see it performed live in a couple of months and I know it will be incredible.<br /><br />---<br />My one complaint about the album isn't for the album itself, but for Amazon's shipping. When I received the CD, the front of the case had a huge crack that reached to the edge of the case and made the front and back of the case fall apart. Then, after taking out the CD, I noticed that the middle section that holds the CD in was broken also, so the CD will fall out if I try to put it in. I'm not pleased about that, it seems like someone stepped on the packaging or something.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just an amazing story. The first time I read it right on the heals of Catching Fire & was annoyed by this suffering drugged & mentally damaged Katniss . This time I mourned with her & had more empathy for her trauma.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kid got me hooked on this game! So addictive!  Now we play as a family - all taking turns - quality time with my kids!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I just happened to find this album when I was checking out an Amazon $5 download sale. I am in love with this album since the first time I listened to it. Its original and though the album is cohesive, every track is different. I have hundreds of albums and this is in my top 10 for sure. An Indie Rock gem if you ask me. Get it!
B0088WLM9K|4.0|I did not care for the SG spin offs before this one. Pretty good even if it's only two seasons.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I have fallen in love with Of Monsters and Men. I think I first heard a song on a show something, long before the videos and radio airplay in the US. I bought the album and can't get enough. They are so original, with poetic lyrics and a unique musical style that I find hard to categorize or relate to other bands. If you choose one album to buy this year, buy this one! Indie and mainstream music fans alike will get hooked on this band.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|This map is bad, I was hoping for a map I did not have to download one by one. I need to know how to get my money back. Is just a big waste of time.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I love this game! I remember playing a very similar game on the internet a few years ago. I loved it then and it's even better now. It might seem like a strange idea for a game, but it is a very thrilling strategy game. In my opinion, it is like the game Risk, but instead of the object of the game being world domination, it's world elimination. If you love challenging strategy games, then this is the game for you.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|Lots of fun, good story, and really interesting.<br />A bit like X-Files but better science and plot.<br />Definitely worth watching.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Love her music and her videos.  Such a creative performer.  Some what mystical in the melodies, which I really love.  She is great!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I now have the Susan Boyles three records.  And when she makes another one I will get that too.  o
B003A9FFNA|4.0|My favourite melodies on this album are:  Messages, for the very uplifting feeling that it always gives me when I am feeling in a melancholy mood.  The song never fails to bring my spirit up a few octaves.  Prelude and Dream in Open Spaces are my second two favourite melodies.  Just beautiful melodies.  These melodies will stay with me long after I have finished listening to them and often times, I will play them in the background while I am reading a novel on my Kindle Fire HD.  Perfect backdrop for romance novels.  I do like all the other melodies on this album as well.  But the three above I listen to everyday.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|Entertaining movie with a good message for children and adults about bullying. Everyone can take something away from this movie.
B00AI3UP54|5.0|Digibooks are worth it just for the cool case ! Special features are basically the same but prequel comic is pretty cool . Shipped quick and received promptly. Would definitely buy again .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|honestly one of the best books I've ever read. If you like romance novels with a good bit of suspense and mystery, you'll love this. Seriously, worth every penny.
0393327655|5.0|awesome. Sam Harris tells the truths, the world should read this and wake up!. Brilliant. I look forward to reading much much more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so so awesome. you need to get this game! If you don't you may as well just not buy anything until you do. there is no reason not to get this game<br />. it's free and it's awesome. I totally recommend this game 100%  if you don't get this game you might die of being weird. you need to buy this game today. awesome game. buy it. bye
B007J7LFTW|4.0|So many of the reviews of this album completely miss the mark, in my opinion. I've read everything from, \\"This album should never have been made\\" to \\"How dare he make a sequel to a classic\\" to \\"His voice isn't what it used to be\\" and \\"I hate the poetry readings.\\"<br /><br />Wow. It's really too bad that some people can't seem to get over their (often odd) expectations. This is an amazing and inspired piece of work; one of the better albums from anybody in recent years. I don't see the need for any of these inconsequential comparisons. If you've ever liked anything Ian Anderson has done then this album should be a wonderful unexpected gift, not because it is a sequel, but because it is so very, very good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't put the series away from reading. Gonna read Mokinjay tomorrow. Love the series so much. Can't wait for movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I kept hearing about this show.  Sat down to watch it and immediately was hooked.  Used Amazon instant video to purchase this season thru the TV pass so I was able to watch the entire season BEFORE it aired which is a great service offered by Amazon and very reasonably priced.  If you haven't watched the show, just make it through the first 3 episodes of season 1 which are admittedly slow and you'll find yourself at Amazon buying the seasons.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was amazing, it seriously left my jaw dropped. I haven't been able to put it down. One minute you're feeling anxious and the next you're wanting to cuddle up to it man. Amazing. And a nightmare.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this years ago and it's still a page-turner!  I couldn't put it down.  One of King 's best!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book reminded me a lot of Fifty Shades of Grey, only the scenario being a little bit different otherwise.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed these books! The story was disturbing but the characters overall were well developed and the story moved quickly. Great weekend read!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Not only do you get the war side of Chris Kyles experience, but you also learn his personal conflicts.  The reader comes away learning that America's most active service men do have have a family life they must deal with under the most difficult situations.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|good cute app for the kids my daughter loves to play this have no problems with loading all around great app
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Wished I would have gone with the kindle fire.  Didn't check that it didn't have a reading light.  Does work well.
B004FP1WX0|1.0|Let me save you some time and money. Don't watch this film. Knew nothing about it, but was totally predictable, and boring.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|it was good but wasnt jason bourne. like the new true grit, he ant john wayne.  i didnt like the new true grit.
0307719219|5.0|It's a well written, extensively-researched book.  It is accessible even though it's written by scholars from MIT and Harvard.  It explained the reasons from a historical perspective why nations are poor or not prospering.  European domination, exploitation and destruction of other cultures and economies is fundamental to the underdevelopment we see in nations around the world today.  The Dutch engaged in genocide in what is now Indonesia to control the spice trade.  The British, the Portuguese and the French turned many economies around the world to purely extractive projects.  Those nations could not take advantage of the Industrial Revolution and all the technologoies that came with it.  Africa was savaged.  The Atlantic Slave Trade destroyed their economies and the British exported arms and gunpowder to different societies, which intensified the wars that fueled the slave trade. In South Africa.  whites destroyed a prosperous farming culture.  African farmers donated 46 pounds to a Fund or Trust that was meant to ameliorate the poverty and misery of textile workers in Britain!  The point of this book is that institutions matter in development.  Inclusive rather than extractive institutions, with a centralized state, are necessary for economic prosperity.  Creative destruction is also necessary.  When elites prevent creative destruction, which gives birth to new modes of production, it leads eventually to economic disasters.  The authors gave copious and detailed examples around the world to support this theory.  Their theory  calls into question the Culture, Geography and Ignorance Theories of Underdevelopment.  They are very convincing.  It's a highly readable book for people who want to go beyond the headlines.  Fine scholarly work.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I'm a hiker, but the book was more about her decision to take on this great experience. She made a lot of bad choices in her life, but this book keeps you riveted, waiting for more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book just like the first two. This one took me longer to read but kept my interest. This book is a definite must read to have closure for the series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love reading about life from different perspectives. Grissom really brought the characters alive and made you want to learn more about them. I would definitely recommend this book.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Pretty solid quality with re-mastered classics in Blu-Ray.  Not quite as crystal sharp as original Blu-Ray but still very good.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game keeps you preoccupied. Nice decent game. Definite game play if your in a waiting room or similar situation.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the most interesting and amazingly well written book that I have ever read. I look forward to reading the next book/books that you write.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|Although is appears to display and run statistical scrips.  I does seem to slow down my kindle; maybe the ads.
B00AJLHUYO|2.0|Ethan Hawke's character is in need of a better movie, as he meanders his way through an underwhelming screenplay and lazy jump scares.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Everything works as advertise. Great sound quality, great features. The only minor complain that shuffle mode seems to repeat the same 100 songs or so over and over, even though I have about 2000 tunes in the USB pen drive
B00A4W3AJC|4.0|Horrible film or amazing achievement, you decide. Despite disappointment after my first viewing, the essence of the film and the images still linger inside me. Not so much a cohenrent film as a symphony of episodic musical cues and blissful visuals. Hit me with moments of brillance and headscratching bewilderment. Once the cars start having a comversation in the parking lot and the credits roll, you'll feel you need to see this film again. Not because it requires your undivided attention, but because you'll probably be dying to see it again.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Only showed how much battery life was remaining.  Did not meet my needs of killing apps.  I was looking for something to help extend time between charges.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Familiar, yet an immensely satisfying coming of age tale. Though at times it all seems a bit uninspired with a knack to trip over itself quite too often, it excels due in large part to a blissful and effective screenplay brought to life by powerful performances.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|i really didn't enjoy the game, i found it to be a little too juvenile for me, maybe a young child might enjoy it! I also did not like the fact that it is repetitious, it tells you what to do and how to do it with every animal, the goal is to help the other species build a home, then find a mate then get a baby. Its like that with all of the animals. I really cant say much because it just wasn't my type of game!
B0042J6VUS|3.0|I got it to fit an samsung galaxy s3, without case.<br />The top is spring loaded, looks like it can't fit it. But you push the phone at an angle as I read in a earlier review, and it will fit. The top spring will be bent back, but it looks like it might survive. I wish it was bigger though, It might break soon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is much and very challenging. i recommend it to any one who wants to pass an adventurous time and laughing lots. My son who is 12 plays it better than me and gets a kick out of me playing. its really a fun game. ENJOY!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Lots of info. Accurate readings. Thoroughly satisfied. Thanks for making a great product. Here are a few more words to make it to twenty.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is fun and challenging. i spend hours playing, i recommend it to any one who ,likes a challenge and likes puzzles as much as i do. If your that kind of person  then this is for you. ENJOY!!
B008220DIC|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film begins with introductory sketchlike shots of Freddie Quell, a WWII soldier who it seems has spent a little too much time overseas.  The opening minutes of the movie reveal that he's freakishly obsessed with sex, has a serious drinking problem and very likely has nothing waiting for him back in the States.  His comrades feed his weaknesses gleefully, happy as schoolchildren to see the mindless animal perform.  Quell, borderline insane perhaps, goes home with his fellow soldiers sometime after we see him take great lengths to make moonshine.  After failing to keep a job as a department store photographer or as a farmer, Quell slips onto a yacht commanded by Lancaster Dodd.  Dodd claims to be many things--writer, doctor, physicist, philosopher--and says he knows about Quell's juice and has tried it and likes it very much and wants some more.  (This is an off-brand of booze that Quell has made with paint thinner.)  So a sort of bond is formed between the two men; the aimless Quell has nothing better to do than get schnozzed and do physical labor for Dodd, and Dodd sees something in Quell that he may be able to use in his life's work, \\"The Cause,\\" a movement which asks its followers to recall past lives in order to discover the answers to problems in their present states.    The dark heart of the movie is the relationship between the unstable Quell and the charismatic Dodd.  Likened to L. Ron Hubbard by rumor-starters before Anderson's movie had even been shown once, Lancaster Dodd is wonderfully portrayed by Hollywood's great big man, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who smiles through his mustache at just the right moments to his character's listeners, and asks deeply personal questions to newcomers, unflinching to their responses.  As mysterious and layered as Dodd may be (and by the way, Hoffman's simply in top form), it's Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the mumbling, frightening, possibly shell-shocked veteran Freddie Quell that will leave you astounded.  (If it's one nominee who could've rivaled Daniel Day-Lewis for the Oscar, it's Phoenix by far, and this lowly reviewer dares say the man was robbed.)  Phoenix simply disappears into the role; gone are the evil cool of his performance as Commodus in Ridley Scott's \\"Gladiator\\" and the troubled badassery of Johnny Cash in \\"Walk the Line.\\"  Here Phoenix plays a dangerous half-monster of a man, a curled-lip wino who simply can't get his act together and more or less doesn't care.  He has nothing to do, nothing to lose, nothing to believe in but the prescriptive demands of those around him, be it Dodd or Dodd's wife Peggy (played Amy Adams whose girl-next-door face makes the character really get to you when she does the things she does to the two lead males).  And a man with these qualities is unpredictable.    What \\"The Master\\" is really about, thinks this worthless reviewer, is not \\"The Cause\\" or Lancaster Dodd or hardly even Freddie Quell, though it is arguably the latter character's story, but rather the battle one of them fights to keep him on a self-medicated track, and the attempt the other makes to stay in the left lane forever and do simply what he wants.  Which, you really have to hand it to Quell, since he doesn't seem to really live anywhere but with his hosts, themselves hosted.  The Dodds and their crew don't pay rent or for groceries; they make appearances, perform and are given the Rain Man suites.  Quell simply goes with the flow.  At first he looks more or less convinced that the experiences Dodd's patients are real, and then calls Dodd a fake when they are both thrown in prison (this happens a little after Dodd's own fresh-faced son whose actor's looks actually bear a resemblance to Hoffman's tells Quell the man's making things up as he goes).  All in all it doesn't matter if \\"The Cause\\" is BS or not.  What's more interesting is whether Quell thinks it is.  And what's more interesting than that is, after all of the troubling, furrow-eyedspectacles Anderson will show you with his new movie, whether Quell, man at man's worst, will try to help himself.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to get better with each season.  I enjoy watching it on the DVDs because one episode requires immediate viewing of the next.  All of the characters are fully drawn and beautifully portrayed.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The book was ordered on my kindle and came quickly. I have not had a hard time with receiving any books from this company.
0765325950|4.0|Took 2 books with me to Desert Storm.  Misery & Eye of the World.  Now 22 years later the series is finished.  Was a good ending for the series.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|So far I am enjoying this app. Pencilling in numbers makes it easy to keep track of possible answers. Yes.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|What is love without sacrifice?  and sacrifice with out love?  Find out in this wonderfully told story of love, lost and found.  Responsibility to our loved ones...past...and...present.  But make sure you grab the tissues, because cry you will.  Happy tears, and sad ones...this story will touch you in ways you didn't know you could be touched, way down deep in your heart!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good twist and turns that were not expected nor foreseeable.  Easy and fast reading.  Kept me wondering who killed the judge.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Leave it to Nicholas Sparks to &#34;spark&#34; things up!  He just keeps coming up with great ideas, in my book!  Another great book, and a must read!  You won't regret it!  See for yourself!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved every word! Cried all the tears, had a few laughs. And now, I need more. This was a beautiful book with great little life lessons. A must read!
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I didn't grow up reading this kind of stuff, so I guess you could say, I am trying to make up for lost time.  I haven't read many, and I can't seem to read them in succession, but I am reading them.  This is the second Jane Austen novel I've read, and I really couldn't tell you which one I liked better.  I think it would probably have to be this one.  Maybe it was because I had already had a little practice with Pride?  I don't know.  But this one, to me, seemed to be a love story from the start, and also seemed to be much sweeter, somehow.  But I'm not sure what it was that struck me closer to the heart, because Pride was just as much so...wasn't it?  Anyway, if you want to read the classics, and can get past the old english, which to me is kind of elegant, then give this a try.  It is a good read, after all...
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game. It keeps your mind sharp. I don't like that you have to purchase items to enter certain rooms.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|But you're going to have to read it to find out how!  Nicholas Sparks has pulled off another winner!!!!!  Try it for yourself!!!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is fun and easy to play. The different levels allow for more or less distraction. Great to play in a waiting room or while riding in a car.<br />The only thing I dislike is that it won't play in landscape format. It is harder to hold in portrait view, but I still love the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AMAZING! It is so fun. It never gets boring and you always try to get new people like all the time. Right now I am getting king. I recommend this game because it is action-packed and FUN!!!!!
B009C7JS14|5.0|Great to have when traveling. We entered the zip for where we were and it showed us all the weather information we needed. I will use this App over and over again.<br />I only wish that I could view this App in landscape format. That's how I set up my clock at night, so i have to pick it up in the morning to check the weather.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I HAD THIS ON VHS AND I LOST IT SO I WERE LOOKING TO REPLACE MY LOST TAPE. SO I FOUNDED IT ON BLU-RAY ANDI LOVE IT. I JUST LOVE MICHAEL JACKSON ALSO AND HIS MUSIC. MISS HIM A LOT
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this clock. I just had surgery and needed to do something every hour on the hour. I just went to the alarm section and preset all my alarms for the day in a couple of minutes. I also love the note section for the alarm. I was able to enter when to take my meds and what to take. Great feature.<br />It also shows the weather for whatever area you enter, great for travel. I also love the 24-hour feature to keep from having to worry about AM or PM settings.<br />This App is a must-have for your Kindle.<br /><br />Only things I wish it would show is the date. Maybe in an upcoming upgrade?
B0099116AY|5.0|We had already seen the movie but I bought it because my wife really loved it.  Not a chick flick fan but I did enjoy this movie.  Thanx Amazon!
B00138F080|5.0|This album, as well as the group MGMT are really worth having a listen to. Whether as the background music for a party, or the foreground music for a chill night. This is a must have.
B000JML7EC|3.0|Kind of hard getting used to ready the old? English. Slow start with a quick finish. Stupid review wanted 4 more words before submitting a review. So I gave it 15
B004W7OQMA|5.0|I thought this album was amazing, and then I got it on vinyl and it blew me away. A must have in every vinyl collection.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who is even slightly interested in running, if for no other reason than to motivate you to run more.  It's written in as a story, with pertinent aside that delve into some of the research that is being down that shows, far from being a machine built for walking humans are not only built to run, but that we re-evolved to run.  I'm currently training for a marathon, and an office mate pointed me towards the book.  Next race I run, I'm going to start training from zero w/ barefoot style shoes just to see for myself whether the author has it right.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This character is amazing.  I have loved each and every book in this series I have read!  These books are exciting and they are interesting.  They are fast moving and you can't help but like Jack Reacher!
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|I'm relieved to find other Groban fans who think this is not his best.  At first I thought this would be one of those Cd's where the songs will grow on you  ( in my case those are the Cd's that become my most favorite ).  I have given this several listens and so far nothing is happening.  I realise there comes a time in an artists career where they want to take a bit of a detour and explore new avenues, I understand that, but sometimes they can and have taken a wrong turn.  This is what has happened to Groban and  'All That Echoes'.  Except for one or maybe two tracks, 'Brave' and 'False Alarms', the rest are bland, boring or just plain rubbish, especially the last track 'I Believe ...Bla Bla Bla', what a mess!  Grobans vocals are thin and at times strangled.  I guess we just have to wait till his next release to see if he finds his way back to the standard we have all come to expect.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book was great! If u like geek mythology u should read it. What disliked about it was it took way too long to read. I really enjoyed this book
B007RI56NY|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this CD. Every song was good, which is rare. Train seems to put out consistently great music!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The season finale of Christmas at Downton is sumptuous!  Bring it out every year to enjoy this by gone era.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is GREAT! After viewing the first three seasons it isn't even possible to stop. Season number four is a MUST!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If your hooked to Downton Abbey, season 3 won't disappoint!  Interesting evolution of the characters, all of whom are brilliant.<br />Especially enjoyed the sparring of the Grandmamas - both sage, both drole.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The game is great for a newcomer who has never played be for. It progresses in number of tiles and complexity. But what could make it better should be a point system that takes into consideration the amount of times you have to shuffle the titles and take points away from you. That will help to have someone play a certain puzzle until they get it done with no mistakes
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is very addictive fast paced and fun. I have totally enjoyed it and suggest you give it a try!
B009KNPPS0|5.0|Eric fans will be pleased with all the additional material, including an LP version. It's all packaged in a great collectors set.
B001VLFEEE|3.0|Good album but is missing the bonus tracks which really is the main reason that I decided to buy this copy.
B00003CXBK|5.0|All of Miyazaki's films are awesome and the rewatch value is great.  You catch little details you didn't catch the first time through.  Princess Mononoke is a little violent, so if you're getting it for kids, just be aware.  Ponyo, Castle in the Sky and Kiki's Delivery Service are my two year old son's favorites. =)
B0085M9L0U|5.0|Excellent quality of an excellent album. Like most people outside of Africa, the fantastic documentary 'Searching for Sugarman' brought me here
B007TK77QE|3.0|In the style of a modern-day Dickens (too many characters and too much description) J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults gets off to a slow start. The small village of Pagford, where all the many characters are interlinked in one way or another, is thrown into disarray when a local councillor suddenly dies. The fight for the seat brings out the worst in the community: adults and children alike. Eventually picking up, this has a dramatic, satisfying and thought-provoking ending.
1452110581|4.0|But, if you or a friend have experienced a cat's attitude and related reactions to life, you will certainly read these vignettes with a smile. My 'cat owner' friend and I both loved the book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Anyone who has gone through something life changing should read this book. I fell in love with it and read it three times within the first week of having it. It is so beautiful and simple, and i myself found it easy to relate to. Hats off to a wonderful novel with a lot of common problems in our world today.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|&#34;The circus arrives with warning.&#34;<br /><br />With this first sentence you begin a magical journey that keeps you wanting more. The character development, story line, and details are wonderful.  Once you pick this book up make sure you have time to curl up with it and read because you will not be able to pull yourself away!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was a little afraid at first to read this book because of the sexual stuff but this book is more then that. The plot of the story is amazing. A very well written book.
B00AOEA2B4|5.0|Bursting onto the melodic rock scene is Diamond Dawn, a six-piece powerhouse that has instantly created their own identity while creating a masterpiece in the process. \\"Overdrive\\" is a blast to the face of energy from the keyboard intro of Into Overdrive, to the final chord of Powergames. Songs like Take Me Higher, Cryin', Standing As One, and Give It All are instant melodic classics, a beautiful blend of 80s and modern. Strong vocals, pounding drums, catchy keyboards, and ripping guitars throughout. Also worth noting is the production- crisp, loud, in your face, and just beautifully done.<br /><br />Between W.E.T.'s \\"Rise Up\\" and Diamond Dawn's \\"Overdrive,\\" February 26th will go down as one of the greatest days for melodic music ever. Definitely check out Rise Up if you haven't already, and pick up Diamond Dawn's \\"Overdrive.\\" This is the beginning of what I hope to be an incredible career for these talented young musicians. Absolute bliss.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|It's as good as everyone says it is.  Masterful acting, engaging story lines, beautiful settings, I absolutely love this show.
B003RNU8KY|5.0|That's what you will get with The Roots. Good, clean, meaningful hip-hop music. Too bad that we lack this in today's era of rap & hip-hop.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was insanely impressed by this book. It is so well researched and grounded for such a big idea, it felt small and personal. There isn't a ton of character development but the fun and ingenuity make up for it. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next!
B00136NUG6|5.0|Enuff said right there but since I have to have a certain number of words, I'll reiterate. It's Earth Wind & Fire.....
B0058YPGVQ|3.0|The program picked up right where the other stopped,  and would have great if it didn&#34;t freeze up in places and we had to spend a-lot of time getting it to move on so maybe we missed a little but it was realy good and can't wait for 5 to come out.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno is one of those artist who is so different and yet so great that you wonder how we got thru without more artist like him. In a time where the quality of music/ entertainers is dwindling rapidly, it's nice to hear a guy who can actually sing and makes you feel something with his music. Definitely recommend.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I read the other reviews. Unlike others my Kindle eBook contained no other stories but the title story (purchased Feb, 2013). I did  not mind the descriptions, the story held me and the descriptions help me understand what the man was going through. Since most of the story only has the one character I don't see how it could have been otherwise. Keep in mind this was written in 1954. I compare the story line to the movie Castaway with Tom Hanks. It is the story of a man alone in the world trying to survive a plague that turns everyone else (as far as he can tell) into zombie like creatures. I enjoyed it.  A short read.  You understand what he is going through, the stress, his breakdowns, his escape through booze, his series of spirit shattering disappointments.  I don't want to give anything away by giving more details.  Suffice to say that the latest movie (based in a large city) is very loosely based on this story which is in a suburb of a small town. I understand the Will Smith movie was the 3rd based on this story.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Great movie and a tear jerker!  Diane Lane is such a great actress!  There are a few stars in this one including John Malkovich - also a great actor!  Highly recommmend!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Good book. Fast read. Somewhat spiritual. I enjoyed learning why she changed her name.  Why was her mother her rock?
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Not sure why or when I bought this, but it's a fun song and great to get people moving!  Buy it if you want!
B0082XKGGU|5.0|Easy to read, plenty to ponder and rethink. Then because he's easy to pick up,put down, go off with Seneca for a while, then return, he's an especially good read.
B004S699HC|5.0|Good storyline and Vincent Perez did well to take over from the late Brandon Lee.<br />..and with Iggy Pop in the movie nothing can go wrong in my opinion..
0064431622|2.0|I love this book and got it for my preschool class. When it came in, it was bent in the middle. The packaging was very bad. If it wasn't 7$ I would send it back. They can't expect to send a paper back book in flimsy packaging and it not bend or tear.
0979019710|5.0|I'm loving reading this book... Hal's righting style is like he's sitting next to you, sharing what you need to know.<br />My son started his challenge 60 days ago & he can NOT believe how much easier he's handling his high stress job. He's lost weight, read 6 books he's always wanted to read, is happier than I've EVER seen him!<br />Now it's MY TURN to learn about this NEW WAY OF LIFE!!
0385537816|5.0|Love this series!! Originally read e version. Had to have hard copies... Money well spent!!  If you're going to buy the series I highly recommend a physical copy, and hard back is more sturdy. :)
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The movie was a little slow to start, but it was enjoyable, and at the end of the movie, you were tapping your feet and smiling.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The way the storyline of this book unfolds is very unique and the story is fantastic.<br />I have no complaints or disappointments with this book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game rocks.  I can play this for hours.  It is a well made game with good graphics. The only con is the way that upgrades are popped up in your face when shopping for upgrades.  Other than that, this is one of the best free apps out there.  I play this on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it is gorgeous.  There are also mini games within the game with the pichinko machine, where you can convert the tiny marbles into useful items like in-game money and cards.  It is almost like the Army of Darkness Defense game, both of which are excellent in their own ways.  Very fun and awesome free app. This is a lot better than most of the free app of the day apps.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I could not stop playing this game!  It was so much fun, but I wish it had way more puzzles especially since  I paid $5 for it!!
B004QX07G4|3.0|Ellen is great but the book is a bit all one note. Much of that was fun but I gave up before the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever<br />In the world and I love horses there so cute,I have 4 of them and there and fun to ride

0735327793|3.0|My almost 5 is just now starting to get somewhat interested in this puzzle. Although younger kids love the story, this puzzle is too diffucult and somewhat boring for them due to all the white.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game even my little nephews and nieces can play this game this game is really fun to play
0141301139|5.0|Ah, how I love Roald Dahl. I recently reread Boy and The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More, so I figured it was time to reread some more of his children's books, all of which I love. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a short, but really clever and entertaining book. It is the story of \\"Fantastic\\" Mr. Fox, and his ongoing battle against Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, three farmers who despise him because he always steals poultry from them. In Fantastic Mr. Fox, they are determined to dig him out and then wait him out. Mr. Fox also has a wife and four small children to protect.<br /><br />In many of Roald Dahl's books, it's about the children outwitting the grown-ups. In Fantastic Mr. Fox, we have instead a clever animal outwitting a bunch of stupid and mean adults. Fantastic Mr. Fox isn't my favorite Roald Dahl book (that honor would probably go to Matilda), but it's certainly a book that I love and enjoy.<br /><br />I probably reread this book in about ten or twenty minutes. It's short, and the font is really big. Plus, a lot of space is covered by some pretty good illustrations (by Quentin Blake). So this whimsical book is perfect for reading aloud or for just reading in a few minutes for some fun. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it's pretty entertaining.<br /><br />There was a movie made of it in 2009, and I saw some of it on a flight when it came out, but I don't think it did this amazing book justice. Fantastic Mr. Fox is just too short for a movie, so they had to add a whole bunch new things into the movie, and none of it has the sheer genius of Roald Dahl. To be fair, I haven't seen the movie in a while.
0316069434|4.0|When someone asks Detective Harry Bosch, homicide specialist with the LAPD, how long he'll stay on the job, he replies \\"As long as they'll let me.\\" In any event, he's in his sixties now and took delayed retirement so he could come back on contract and work for the cold-case squad. And his current case, on the twentieth anniversary of the post-Rodney King riots, is a homicide that took place at that time (one of many that weekend) and on which he was actually the first, very rushed investigator. The victim was a Danish photojournalist apparently covering the riots and who was shot execution-style in an alley. The case was never solved but Bosch is determined to do it this time. And so, in his trademark uncompromising way, he begins picking at the thin, dusty reports, re-examining the handful of personal possessions from the property archives, hunting down those who were present twenty years ago and their associates. And as he begins to unravel the story of what happened, it takes him far afield from both L.A. and the riots.<br /><br />Connelly does first-rate procedural mysteries and this one is no exception, following the cops as they try to think their way through a very cold case and skirt the edge of the law to get things to break their way. And to complicate his life, Harry also has a much younger lieutenant on his back who wants to force him into permanent retirement with an Internal Affairs complaint. Well, he's survived a lot of those in his career, so he figures he can deal with one, too. Maybe. Also, Harry's various personal relationships -- with his partner, David Chu, with his teenage daughter, Maddie, and with his possibly-serious lady friend -- have largely been shifted to the back burner this time in favor of the whodunit plotline. But it works.<br /><br />Bosch has maybe four years left before he has to pack it in for good. I have a feeling we're going to see at least a couple more books in the series before that happens. I'll be waiting, not so patiently.ntly.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Good for a generic cover but definitely not built to use as a stand.  Feels rather flimsy but seems to hold Kindle firmly and is easy to fold back cover and read.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Overall this is a really good Sudoku app with easy controls, simple and elegant graphics, and a mix of easy to hard puzzles. I enjoy playing Sudoku on my phone and have played other versions. This version ranks just as well if not better than the others. As the free app of the day I am very excited to get this for free, but I would pay for this app if it was not.<br /><br />The game play is straight forward and they give you convenient hints and tips if you are really stuck. The permissions on this app are correct for what it is (nothing invasive!). Network state and vibrate control. Overall this is a really good Sudoku app with tons of different puzzles, difficulty settings, and different color schemes to help you out.<br /><br />I would recommend this app and would pay for it if it were not the amazon app of the day! Great job Dev!
B000NTPDSW|4.0|I like the movies and it is in Blu-ray. I thought it was a good buy. Four more words needed. ...doh!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I LOVE this series! This is such an amazing show and so interesting! I love the dynamic between Sherlock and Watson and the cases are so cool and engaging! Watch it, love it, share it!

B00846F1YW|5.0|This was my first mystery app. so I can't say how it stacks up with other apps like this, but I found this to be very enjoyable. It kept me interested and coming back for more. I did it without clock and  the penalties for tapping !! But I'll do it right next time, that's right I would do it again! Like I said I'm no authority but I truly liked this app !!
B0060MYM7O|3.0|Giving this a 3 because season 2 is awful if you've read the books like I have (there are good moments like Jaqen, Ygritte, Ironborn & Theon scenes but then you'd have character assassinations of Cat & Littlefinger (not to mention his teleporting), NotJeyne!Talisa, Ros the whore, every one of Dany's scenes as well as that House of the Undying scene) & also I discovered, when I was watching the Dragonstone featurette, that Disc 5 of the BD was scratched so it skips which sucks because it was the first thing I watched from the BD set.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|this is so easy to use... When I figured out I was putting Negative in upside down or backwards it worked great. copied over 300 negatives in 1/2 hour and they print out beautifully... We want to get another neg. holder they say it can get scratched then show on copy, but so far so good... Works good on Slides when you remember to switch from neg to slide.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game it's just like the game super Mario brothers.<br />This game is the best. I hope you will make another game like this

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best one of the books. It made me cry reading knowing that it will have to end. The hunger games has changed me
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|A rare find that kept me guessing and intrigued, sometimes frustrated and saddened but an overall joy to read.  It's not often I find a book that I can't put down, but this was definitely one of them.  Only downside is that is may make you rethink your choice of flowers the next time you give as a gift...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so amazingly AWESOME and so much fun especially how you can play against your friends and show off ur high scores on Facebook
0143038419|5.0|Even if you've already seen the movie, the book is worth a read.  Elizabeth Gilbert is funny and completely relatable.  Who knows? Maybe you'll follow her lead and cross an ocean yourself.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It broke 2 days after I got it. I will never get another one . And it's hard for people to hear u on it . So fake !!!!!!!!!! Amazon I should get my mney back or another case . Make sure it's real this time !!
B003Y5H574|5.0|Emma Stone is perfection. Ryan Gosling is always perfection. Steve Carell is most perfect when being imperfect.<br />This whole movie is just funny and endearing and I love the way all the stories wrap around each other.
1616550414|5.0|I loved my purchase and i receive really fast! This is not a book is something that any fan of TLoZ must have it. All the art and history are more knowledge to a gamer.
B005LAII1C|4.0|I purchased this movie because what could be funnier than a rude and raunchy talking teddy bear ?<br /><br />I really liked this movie, I guess because it is a guy thing. The story revolves around a child (Wahlberg) who gets a teddy bear for Christmas. He makes a wish that the bear comes alive since he did not have many friends. Move ahead 20 years and Wahlberg is grown with a grown teddy bear living with him. Ted cusses , drinks beer, and is quite the ladies man. It boils down to Wahlberg having to decide between his new girlfriend or his best friend, the crude and rude party boy teddy bear,Ted.<br />Not to spoil this, but it all works out for them both in the end.<br /><br />This movie is quite hilarious at times, but it definitely is not for kids. There is a large amount of profanity, from Ted of course, and some scenes that are not kid friendly.<br /><br />This reminds me of the eighties film, Howard the Duck, in some ways, but it is a whole lot funnier. My better half mostly hated this film and thought it was silly, but sometimes you need a little silliness in your life. I hope they do make a Ted 2. I also think Mark Wahlberg is a great actor and brings life to just about everything I have ever seen him star in.
0812982622|2.0|I read other reviews on what a great read this novel is.  After four weeks, I ams still strugging through it and am just about ready to give up.  I do not find the characters interesting or engaging.  The plot moves very slowly.  While the writing is excellent that in itself is not enough to keep me going. Perhaps I am not interested enough in the politics of North Korea to find this interesting.  I'm disappointed since I had really looked forward to reading this novel.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|The Bourne Legacy is the fourth installment of the Bourne film franchise. It introduces a new protagonist named Aaron Cross played by Renner. This film sort of runs in parallel with the ending of the third installment where Dammon's character , Jason Bourne, exposes the &#34;Treadstone&#34; and &#34;Blackbriar &#34; government operations to the media.<br /><br />The newest operation is called &#34;Outcome&#34; and this is where Renner picks up as Aaron Cross. The new agent is genetically modified via science through a system of pills that makes him sort of superhuman. The problem is, he is running out of these meds and needs to find more. He basically starts to crash at about the same time the &#34;Outcome&#34; project has been terminated. This is where he meets up with Dr. Shearing (Weise) who is one of the doctors that worked on the genetic medicine which gives Renner his strength, speed, and high level of cognition. They stay on the run together trying not to be assassinated like everyone else connected to the new operation. The director over the new government operations is played by Edward Norton. His performance in this movie is barely memorable and lacks that of the previous director of operations played by David Strathairn.<br /><br />Overall if you have seen the previous three movies, you will be more than likely disappointed in this fourth installment. It is very hard to follow and seems as if it has nothing to do with the original Bourne series which we have watched over and over.<br /><br />The actors in this film are great actors, but I think the director is what made this movie a miss for us. In my opinion it seems as if this movie was made to take advantage of the previous Bourne movies. It also was way too long and you are almost glad that ends.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I tried  this  on my sister's kindle only got a bit in I  then I bought it and it was awesome those 1 star guys lie u can either  pay OR do challengers sure its creepy to kill everyone but still great job
B0011Z51QG|5.0|There isn't much I can say about this download that most people are not familiar with. It was very easy to download right to my device and I really liked the price. I just wish that Amazon would offer High Definition 24 bit , 96Khz downloads in Flac format. I realize they would cost more and you would need a potable DAC to enjoy them, but these higher quality downloads are an audiophiles dream. Also, Apple offers a few Flac apps that are amazing. I use it all the time. It made my Shure 535 earbuds sound like the $400.00 I paid for them. I also paired these with an external DAC /amp made by FiiO and the sound is incredible. I use the Andes E07K FiiO DAC and I love my iPod now. I rarely use Apple's music player anymore.<br /><br />I currently buy these High Def downloads from HD Tracks, I just wish Amazon carried them as we'll. There are a lot of audiophiles out there that would love this format even if they just used it is on their music server or computer. I think Amazon could also cash in on a lot of business offering these higher quality downloads for those of us who want them.
0307346617|5.0|A little slow in the beginning, but after a few chapters it opens up, can't stay away from it or put it down!
B008220DGE|1.0|Save your money and your time and watch anything else but this. Whatever movies are supposed to do, they must not bore the viewer. Nothing saves this movie from boredom, although the production design is excellent and the mid-twentieth century of America is well evoked, and although the actors deliver fine performances. Unfortunately, all of them are trapped in a narrative that is tedious and directionless.<br /><br />In 1964, Andy Warhol mounted a movie camera on a tripod, pointed it at the Empire State Building, and let the camera roll for eight hours of slow motion footage. Watch that instead. The story is more compelling.
0425264351|3.0|I needed a fun read for a vacation.  This served the purpose.  It does require that you believe two government investigators can go missing/be murdered, but the FBI and state police won't get involved in the investigation (cause they weren't asked), leaving the investigation it in the hands of a podunk police department - with the help of Mr. Reacher.  The premise also requires that you believe in coincidence.  But Child has a good writing style and he keeps you in the book with a nice progression of mysteries revealed and action.  He doesn't drag out action sequences too long.  Overall, a good light read.  I will likely turn to Reacher/Child again for some \\"escape\\" reading.

B004XQYBA2|5.0|I just uninstalled my other two Sudoku apps. I could never decide which I liked better. This app solves that problem because I definitely like this one best!<br /><br />It's not that this one has any more features than the others, it's just that it is so much more intuitive. Everything that I want to be able to do, I can simply and easily.<br /><br /> As the name suggests, it has 10,000 puzzles with the ability to download more should that ever be necessary. They are all sorted by difficulty and it is very clear which are solved or in progress. There is also a very nice help file with Sudoku history and solving strategies.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great Sudoku app that I highly recommend! Give it a try.

B0000U0X1G|1.0|Although this was recommended as a good movies I really did not care for it.  Good actors but not so good movie.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Have enjoyed this series, season 3 did not disappoint! When do we get season 4? Hope it will be soon.
030758836X|2.0|It was hard to get into and when I did I really did not care for this book, it' language was not what I like.
0553801473|4.0|It was a good book but the first three were definitely better. The fourth and this on have this style of only focusing on certain characters. While it is nice to follow a storyline for a longer amount of time to see how the character develops, it can spend to much time in boring/long scenes. I think Martin needs to put all the storylines back together because this way, he can put the more uninteresting parts from one character with an action filled chapter of another character. This helps the story move along but keeps the reader interested for a longer period of time. All in all, still worth reading.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|A friend who read the series and saw this movie recommended it.  I really loved it except for two scenes that were quite horrible.  Other than that I really enjoyed the story and the actors.  It was quite good.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book!  It was scifi but read like real life. I found myself unable to put it down because I had to know how each crisis would resolve itself and it felt like anything was possible.  Worth way more than than the 99 cents I paid.  Looking forward to reading more books written by this author.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I am not a fan of Tom Cruise but always liked the movies,  I started watched Mission when it was a TV series and never missed an episode.  I have seem most of the movies, this one was good, the action scenes were worth buying this movie, jumping out of this tall build was very scary and exciting.
1451696205|5.0|realy good book it was realy creative writing the book in a series of letters rather than story format. Youe can sympathise with alot of the characters andcan almost see yourself as some of the characterts.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this movie.  Meryl Streep was Julia Child.  I watch it all the time.  I was introduced to Amy Adams in this movie and watch most all her movies.  When I find and actor I like I seem to want to see everything they have done.

B004XQYBA2|5.0|I have played quite a few different Sudoku games on the PC.  This is my first Sudoku on the Kindle Fire HD. While I have not yet explored all the different types of Sudoku available in this game, the basic gameplay is far superior to any that I have experienced. I love the different color options, the way it highlights the numbers while playing and marks the completed numbers. This is a must have game for Sudoku fans.

Would love to see what a skilled artist could create.

055215783X|4.0|A band of travellers from Ankh-Morpork have arrived in the town of Bad Blintz. The band consists of a boy with a flute named Keith, a tomcat called Maurice and a lot of rats. A lot of very smart rats. However, as the town suffers from a curiously well-timed rat infestation and Keith and Maurice prepare to enact 'the scam', it becomes clear that something else is at work in the sewers and tunnels under the town. Something that takes an interest in the curiously smart rodents...<br /><br />The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents was Terry Pratchett's first Discworld novel aimed at younger readers, released in 2001. It was, arguably, the novel that finally broke Pratchett in the USA, where it won the Carnegie Medal and won more notice than his previous books (which had been a cult success at best). Subsequent Discworld books began to hit the New York Times bestseller lists, finally giving Pratchett some Stateside success after almost two decades as Britain's biggest-selling author (well, until the arrival of a certain J.K. Rowling).<br /><br />It's an interesting novel, most notably because Pratchett makes exactly zero concessions to his apparently intended audience. The novel is written in the same manner as his adult books and in fact is actually among the most disturbing Discworld novels, with the revelation of the antagonist in the book being one of Pratchett's more revolting moments. It may have talking rats in it, but the tone is closer to Watership Down (complete with some pretty savage fights and deaths) than to Beatrix Potter. Pratchett seems to do this deliberately, with the rats' belief in a utopian future of animal cooperation stemming from reading a children's book called Mr. Bunnsy Has An Adventure, which becomes a totem of their tribe. Pratchett paints the internal divisions of the rat gang and each character in some detail, with his traditional economic-but-effective storytelling. The book has a darker tone than most of his novels, and whilst thereare still a few laughs here, it's a more intense book than many of the Discworld series.<br /><br />It's also quite snappy, coming in at a breezy 270 pages, avoiding the bloat some of the more recent Discworld books have suffered from. Pratchett sets up his plot and characters, tell his story with impressive depth and characterisation and gets out all in the time that some more traditional fantasy authors are still using to clear their throats.<br /><br />The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents (****) is Pratchett at his more impressive, telling a darker story than normal but with his trademark wit and skills at character-building. It's also a complete stand-alone, with no connections at all to the rest of the Discworld series and can be read completely independently. It is available now in the UK and USA.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Simply outstanding.  A great story, well written... actually I should say stories, as I read the whole trilogy. Thank you.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved the series.  It gives good insight into the historical realities of the British &#34;class&#34; system.  It is one of the few TV programs that is truly family friendly.  Gripping story line, too!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I haven't picked up a book in years. And I kept hearing about this fifty shades. So I decided to buy the first book pretty interesting , now I just finished the second one. I can't stop reading it pulls me in and captivates me. Can't wait now to buy the third book.now. and not to mentioned how much my husband likes me reading it....haha
0470932139|3.0|I am an avid consumer of food blogs.  I read about 25 food blogs religiously and see a lot of food photography.  More and more, food blogs are becoming uniform, with the same distressed-wood platforms and soft-light setups and props that suggest a rustic country kitchen turning out classic dishes for a group of close friends and family gathered around a centuries-old table used by generations past. In short, everyone is becoming Helene Dujardin.  The thing is that I'm sure her photography was once really groundbreaking for its clean images and exact propping.  But now it seems same-old, same-old.  Anyway, I got this book because I thought, at the very least, it would give me a starting point to learn how to create photographs that everyone likes and then work from there to find my own voice.  Except, to me, this book is more a narrative on what it's like to be a food photographer and not any kind of practical instruction on how to be one.  Sure, Dujardin talks about lighting setups and camera angles and composition, but there's no meat here.  It's mostly fluff, not readily applicable to a beginner's abilities and understanding of photography, food styling and composition.  That said, it's a nice read, has beautiful photos (if you can get past the sense that every last cocoa nib has been placed precisely with tweezers....) and has some vague information about equipment and general camera settings that have worked for Dujardin.  Probably better as a pleasure read for some information about the life and work of a successful food photographer than it is an instruction manual.

B00797MB0O|3.0|Most of the movie you just want to slap her, and in the end when you think she might have grown up, you want to slap her again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Like Temple Run 1 but on steroids. Graphics are better and you get to choose from different characters. Also, each character has a different skill set that you can buy upgrades for to improve their performance. Fun and more addicting because you always will set it down, but only after you upgrade something and then you want to keep trying after that upgrade to see how much it helped, then you get close to another upgrade so you can't set it down just yet...
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I don't normally read thrillers but I had to read this one as I felt completely out of the loop when people kept asking me if I had read it. Glad to say it completely lived up to its reputation and was one of the most original and intriguing books I have read for a while. The story of a dysfunctional marriage Gone Girl shows us just how messed up most of us really are but don't probably show it. In this book we see the consequences of what happens when people show their true colours. There were also lots of subtle but very clever lines scattered throughout the book that made me feel that Gone Girl was much more than just a thriller, it is a social commentary. Would love to be able to write something like this myself, that appeals to everyone but is so much more than another page turner.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|There are many, many good things in this Emma. A very fine and varied screenplay that moves along in a leisurely fashion while focusing on character. Generally excellent acting, with neither Mr. Woodhouse nor Miss Bates played for humor (though I do admit considerable enjoyment of Prunella Scales' turn as Miss Bates in Thompson's version). Clever casting: Mrs. Elton is the only blonde aside from Emma, thus emphasizing in physical appearance as well, the likenesses in personality that develop an immediate antipathy in the latter for the Vicar's new wife.<br /><br />We get plenty of Stately Georgian Manor views, inside and out. Some brief but effective glances of the life lived outside the wealthy set's bubble--which mirrors Austen's own treatment. A judicious selection of dialog. Strong costuming. Direction that is usually invisible, but occasionally partakes in the wit--as in the visual spin-and-snap when the plans for a quiet outing are twice taken over and regimented by Mrs. Elton. Two of the three dances we see are authentic (and they're the best), and the dancing itself is spot-on; and having met my future wife many years ago at a Celtic dancing society where we both were members, I have a small bit of knowledge about that.<br /><br />Of course, some things are changed, but that's only to be expected, given modern sensibilities. Emma is much more forthcoming in expressing her affection and concern to Miss Bates the morning after insulting her, where Austen is very restrained. And we're never shown Emma withdrawing from Harriet in the film the way ever-class-conscious Austen has her do so in the book, signifying her displeasure with crossing class lines. But there are none of the character rewrites one finds, for example, in the most recent Mansfield Park. There's fidelity to the characters, and that's a very good thing to those who value Austen's ability to create believable personalities that fit within their culture.<br /><br />The things I don't like are few,but deserve to be mentioned. First, Romola Garai, while a fine actress, is completely of the 20th/21st century in her gestures, facial expressions, and movements. She stands out all the more in that the rest of the cast displays a finer understanding of the appropriate style.<br /><br />Second, there's a judicious amount of Romantic/Impressionistic musical wash that's completely alien to Austen. I guess it's to be expected in a comedy of manners that, to interest our times, also must be a modern romance. This will probably bother almost no one save me, and as I already wrote, there's some good popular dance music of a folk variety as shown. It's also great to see and hear the actual actresses of Emma and Jane Fairfax sing: a decent amateur and a moderate one. Instead of the professionals overdubbing as was the case in Thompson's Emma.<br /><br />Third, the cleanliness of it all.  The women visit the outdoor market on market day, and there's no dust, grime, dirt, etc. The entire group go to take the view on a stifling day at Box Hill: nobody sweats, and all the clothes are neat.  Harriet is knocked down by the gypsy boys: when she's brought back to the Woodhouse estate by Frank, the only evidence of this is the tiniest smudge of grime near one eye. It's as though the whole place had a squad of Laundering Nazis dusting, vacuuming, and otherwise tidying up everybody and everything 24/7.<br /><br />But those are my only complaints. This is far more authentic to character and depth than Thompson's version, which I still enjoy a good deal. And I can make allowances for Garai. If 4 1/2 stars were possible, I'd give them, but since I can't, my objections aren't sufficient to really knock off a star. This is the Emma to get.
B004UM6KGW|5.0|This book is so good that I think other than the Bible,  it is the best book I have ever read.  I wish someone had told me long ago, no, begged me to read this book.  I am so grateful I found M. Scott Peck!
1616550414|5.0|This book is a Zelda lover's dream. Packed with tons of artwork from pre-production and alternate art styles are a glimpse into how much work is put into this series as a whole. There's lots of trivia and unknown facts including the official Zelda timeline which has been a mystery up until now. The cover is deep green with gold embossed lettering and feels more like a coffee table book than a fan-boy throw-together. The pages are of good stock and most are in full, glorious color. The aesthetic is amazing, and it looks and feels impressive.<br />The book is divided into four &#34;parts&#34;, with the beginning focusing only on Skyward Sword [Pg. 5-66], the golden brown section features the timeline (except for the CD-I games, Link's Crossbow Training, and the BS Satellaview Zelda released in Japan) the third section [Pg. 66-136] focuses on touching a bit on each main game released [Pg. 137-237], and the final section houses a manga style comic (To be read in REVERSE; PG 277 to the end on Pg. 240) [Pg. 240-277]. There are special messages from Eiji Aonuma (Development head of EAD #3 Division and series producer), Shigeru Miyamoto (Series creator), and Akira Himekawa (Manga), along with a few ads and full color artwork pages in between.I would have preferred the book to go in chronological order and give more in depth info about each individual title than they did, especially Majora's Mask.<br />A must buy for Zelda fans, truly; and a stunning gift overall.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is boss get it! But I think the first temple run is a little better. The graphics for temple run2 is better and there is zip lines, but there is less characters, the power ups suck, and the temple is to modern. Temple Run2 is still good, it's just that the first one is better, so get it instead.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Totally blown away, downloading the next one now!!! Highly recommend! Any and all Batman fans must read this, seriously, like right now!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I particularly like the voice notifications of battery level; you can set which levels you want voiced - different ones while charging or unplugged. Quiet hours 10pm to 7am but that's too early for me so I plug in my earphones overnight, which is simpler than switching off the voice setting or the Kindle. (I'm using Kindle Fire HD bought in the UK, Autumn 2012)
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was very comforting in knowing that life doesn't end when we die. I love how he takes us on a spiritual journey that leaves us wanting to know more. It reminded me of  [[ASIN:0615578845 From Hollywood to God]] by Kelly Granite Enck. I couldn't put that book down. Both books are great if you seek a spiritual journey! However, Proof of Heaven lost momentum towards the end and it was harder to follow. Other than that it was worth the read.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book will made me think about who my parents were before I existed as well as how my children won't know who I was before I was a mom.  Intriguing characters & well thought out plot.
0143038419|5.0|This book was so good. I could not put it down. What made me buy this book was because I read [[ASIN:0615578845 From Hollywood to God]] by Kelly Granite Enck. Both books are about a women's spiritual journey to finding what they are missing in life. They both travel all over the world and experience places that most of us only dream about. I just love books that talk about travel, love, and where the person never gives up on what they are looking for! For those of you who loved this book I am sure you are going to love From Hollywood to God just as much!
B0076794IO|4.0|The expat lifestyle, startling imagery and a mystery involving the FBI, white collar crime and an ex-CIA operative with a haunting past make sure that you have an exciting and riveting story that won't disappoint.
B00AFEY354|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />It’s hard to find a word to describe this movie other than “fantastic,” “great,” “powerful” or “amazing.” Which, now that I think about it, these are the same words that came to mind after reading the book. After I found out that Stephen Chbosky, the author of the book, was directing the movie I expected this to be one of the most legit film adaptions to date. I was expecting pretty much a line for line recreation of the novel, but that didn’t happen. So most of my complaints come from the differences between the two.<br /><br />When making a film adaption for a novel it’s natural to make changes so it’s a more enjoyable cinematic experience, but some things they changed, or left out completely, were kind of odd. For example they left out the lunch that Charlie (Logan Lerman) had with Bill (Paul Rudd) which was, in my opinion, a very important scene in the book. It really showed the relationship between the two and explained why Bill acted the way he did towards Charlie. They kind of gave a half-assed version of this on the last day of school, but it wasn’t the same. The other major scene that got left out was the whole ordeal with Charlie’s sister Candace (Nina Dobrev). Once again this was one of those sections that really helped build the relationship between Charlie and another character, but it was completely ignored. Which is really sad because Charlie’s family as a whole kind of felt like an afterthought in this film.<br /><br />The only major gripe in terms of scenes being altered was the scene before Sam (Emma Watson) left for college. It felt really watered down in comparison to the novel. It was kind of the climaxing point in the book, but here it just seemed like another scene. There were other scenes too. Like when Charlie was shoveling snow at the party, Sam came to talk to him instead of Mark. How Charlie approached Sam and Patrick at the football game. The confrontation between Patrick and Brad in the “nutrition center.” It’s actually surprising how many changes were made.<br /><br />With all that aside the movie was, as I said before, fantastic. The cast was excellent, even though I pictured some of the characters differently. I didn’t expect Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) to look like so much of a punker chick, and I pictured Bill as someone who was a little overweight, wore glasses, and was bald on the top of his head, but had hair on the sides. Either way, both Paul Rudd and Mae Whitman did a fantastic job. The person who played Bob (Adam Hagenbuch) was perfect and I almost died when I saw his face after Charlie gave him the bubbles. It was such a simple, kind of insignificant, part of the story, but it was just perfect.<br /><br />Logan Lerman and Emma Watson were fantastic as well and they had great chemistry in their scenes together. At first I was kind of on the fence with Erza Miller, the guy who plays Patrick. There were some scenes where I felt he was amazing, but then there were others where I felt they went over the top with the whole homosexual thing. Especially when you take into consideration that Patrick is supposed to be the dominant one in his relationship. The only character I felt was poorly cast would be Charlie’s brother Chris (Zane Holtz). He’s supposed to be a freshman in college, but he looks old enough to have a six year old son. They didn’t give him a lot of screen time, but every time I saw him it felt weird.<br /><br />The DVD contains some bonus footage as well as the main movie. You have some deleted scenes and an altered version of the beginning. Most of the scenes, although not in the book, were nice and would have definitely been a nice contribution to the main film. Most of it was family related material that showed the reserved yet lovable bond between Charlie and his family. One of the deleted scenes is actually a slightly altered version of the scene with Candace. Now it wasn't perfect, but it was still a beautiful and should have been included. Along with the deleted scenes you have the &#34;Best Day Ever&#34; feature which is basically a clip lasting around five minutes that has Stephen, Logan, and Emma discussing what it was like on set. Then you have three &#34;Dailies&#34; which are three separate clips that Stephen looked at when he felt that they were never going to get a shot right.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.75/10 - Even though a lot of things got changed from the novel the film was still extremely enjoyable. Part of me feels they had to change a lot so they could keep the PG-13 rating. Which kind of sucks because when I saw it in theaters there was only like ten other people in the theater with my sister and I. If you're a fan of the book I would definitely recommend watching it. My only advice would be to go in with an open mind and not expect a perfect book-to-film recreation. To those who haven't read the book well what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor a read the book first then watch the movie. You'll appreciate it more that way.

B00BHU2A7I|5.0|When I was about ten years old some 45 years ago I remember my grandparents giving me a hardcover book of ghost stories each with an introduction by Alfred Hitchcock. In fact if I remember correctly the series was called \\"Alfred Hitchcocks Bed Time Stories:.<br /><br />Well, between the books and the television show my fascination with Alfred Hitchcock began early on.<br /><br />Brilliant, one of a kind, a maverick and a deeply flawed human being. However he was in every way a true master of movie making and an editor beyond reproach. The latter something I especially liked seeing included in \\"Hitchcock\\" because it's really there - in the editing room where movies are made.<br /><br />Hundreds and often thousands of hours of film are whittled down to a seamless ninety  minutes of magic.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as \\"Hitch' his movements, voice syntax are spot on. The makeup spectacular and the transformation is brilliant. Oddly there were many times I could hear Hannibal Lechter in the voice and see Him in \\"Hitches\\" slow turning gaze and the even slower closing eyes.<br /><br />Perhaps because the real Hitchcock carried and expressed himself much like the fictional Lechter I don't know. However,  I do know Hopkins is a national treasure and that there is no trace of Lecter in any of his post \\"Silence\\" films. Regardless, the performance is stunning and a kick to watch.<br /><br />The entire cast is smashing. Helen Mirran is sheer perfection as Alma, Hitchcock's wife, muse, editor, writer, co director, protector and touch stone. And it's here inside their relationship that the story unfolds. They were certainly  a unique and formidable team and the film pays tribute to a relationship as uncanny and unique as the movies they created.<br /><br />The entire cast is sensational  a few standouts being Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Toni Collette as Hitchcocks long time assistant Peggy Robertson - and a remarkable performance by James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, every movement, his voice, his appearance is a bulls eye it's absolutely uncanny.<br /><br />At it's heart \\"Hitchcock \\" is a love story, those looking for an in depth look at how Psycho was made may be disappointed, those hoping to find a bit of what made one of the most prolific directors in the history of the world tick will adore every moment of this film.<br /><br />It's an endearing and brilliant homage to one the greatest directors of all time.kins, every movement, his voice, his appearance is a bulls eye it's absolutely uncanny.<br /><br />At it's heart \\"Hitchcock \\" is a love story, those looking for an in depth look at how Psycho was made may be disappointed, those hoping to find a bit of what made one of the most prolific directors in the history of the world tick will adore every moment of this film.<br /><br />It's an endearing and brilliant homage to one the greatest directors of all time.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first 2 books of this series. However, I was extremely disappointed in this last book.  It was very sad and depressing, and I felt like the author went over the top for the sake of entertainment. The beginning started out well, then the plot was all over the place. It was just discouraging to follow this trilogy and then have it end with this last book.  Just stop after the first two. :(

I enjoyed the fact that there is a storyline and you learn more about the relationship between the 2 main characters.

I was not too impressed with this movie but I think kids will enjoy seeing all the special weapons used throughout the movie.

I've enjoyed the times their documentary has been on TV,<br />and cannot wait to buy a copy of it.  Little did they realize when they were young guys, the millions that they could<br />provide pleasure!  How worthwhile and great they must feel!  I hope they keep going on with their great talents.  Glen<br />and Don have written fabulous songs!!! They are an inspiration to young people who remain with what it is that they love.<br />They also demonstrate that success comes with very hard work.  Congrats to them.!!!

(Clearaudio Concept,  Concept carbon fibre tone-arm, Grado Statement Sonata 1 cartridge, Grado PH 1 phono stage, Roksan Kandy K2 integrated amp, Celestion SL600Si speakers)<br /><br />Side one<br />&#34;Where Do the Children Play?&#34; – 3:52<br />&#34;Hard Headed Woman&#34; – 3:47<br />&#34;Wild World&#34; – 3:20<br />&#34;Sad Lisa&#34; – 3:45<br />&#34;Miles from Nowhere&#34; – 3:37<br />Side two<br />&#34;But I Might Die Tonight&#34; – 1:53<br />&#34;Longer Boats&#34; – 3:12<br />&#34;Into White&#34; – 3:24<br />&#34;On the Road to Find Out&#34; – 5:08<br />&#34;Father and Son&#34; – 3:41<br />&#34;Tea for the Tillerman&#34; – 1:01<br /><br />This was Cat Steven's most popular album... It is worth the money for the first three tracks alone.  Though I have always loved Father and Son the most.<br /><br />What is most special is how quiet this pressing is with the resultant increase in information that can be picked up from the vinyl.  There is no extraneous noise; this pressing makes the music totally transparent and brings out the timbre of Cat Stevens's voice like I have never heard before.  The clarity of the vocals is astonishing and is coupled  with incredible detail revealed on the guitar... I swear you can hear the plectrum rub against the strings on &#34;Sad Lisa&#34;.  Bass lines are solid and decay perfectly.<br /><br />If you have an old pressing, or you are looking for a timeless classic which will make your ears smile, buy this LP it is worth every cent.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|The hero and secondary characters are complex, and believable.  It is a classic coming of age tale with authenticity to it.  Lately I am finding a lot of fantasy authors are rushing through, and I feel like I am reading a less sophisiticated, or dumbed down story that just rushes to action.<br /><br />Ryan, takes a deliberate pace, but I was never bored, because I cared about the plot and the characters.  As often the case in this genre, you fear that as you get further from the humanistic part of the tale and into the magic or supernatural, that the story might lose something.  Often like a JJ abrams show, or Stephen King book, the intrigue of the evil is more compelling than the actual evil.  However, as the final pages unfold, and the evil begins to really have a face, the story only plunges ahead with renwed intrigue and some twists.<br /><br />It is Martinesque in that there are no pure good or pure bad characters, just real people who fit somewhere within that spectrum.  Read it, and it is cheap to boot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This games FUN it keeps you enjoyed if u have kids or your a rancher and your horse is not there u good just play on this
B004Y1USV2|3.0|What surprises me is that although I'm one of the many folk who is upset that - for now - Jon Anderson isn't in the band, I play this album far more than I play 'Open Your Eyes', 'Ladder' or 'Magnification'. What should that tell you!!??
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun. Levels get more challenging as you move up. Time trials are very competitive. Enjoy this game very much.
B001TM14VC|5.0|Love, love this movie ♥ I'm a fan!!! I  love to catch up on some oldies but goodies brings back memories
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Good game with good features.  Some upgrades seem like they should be easier to get but I guess it keeps you playing longer.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This book is insane! It starts off like a train, building with a slow chug, and as the book continues to move on it goes faster and faster until you are suddenly hanging on for dear life to an out-of-control caboose, swinging on the tail end of a runaway train on a mountain....and at the end, you smash unexpectedly into a wall, explode, and get thrown completely out of the train you thought you were in.<br /><br />The author is always a step ahead of you, though at first you don't realize it. This book will totally twist your brain around backwards in your head. All I could think of was the movie Sixth Sense, where after the ending I wanted to go back and watch it all over again to see how I missed parts and to relive the movie under the altered experience....the same with this book. The ending created such a plot twist that I felt like I wanted to go back and read it again to compare.<br /><br />Great fun! I think I forgot to breathe for several chapters at the end.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|Keeps my child busy which is the point of it.  And its much better than watching some of the other cartoons out there.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|This book was on my recommended list and since I was looking for something new. Still building my ebook collection, amazing how many books I have read in the last 25 years. I will purchase the next book in the series and see how things work out.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A lot better  than the weather channel I'll tell you that. Just type in your zipcode and you get the weather for today as well as the next 7 days. Also get sunset/sunrise etc. A very good app. You also get sever  weather alerts. Nothing fancy but a necessity if you like to keep track of weather.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was a touching story and will probably remain a favorite for years. I liked the discussion ideas at the end and even though I am not in a group I considered them each.
B004JVZXXU|2.0|Funny scene where they are supposingly looking on a laptop for information, yet it's not even on.<br /><br />I think the reason why many people don't find this one as scary is because they know it isnt real. There was so much hype and speculation about the first, it really bummed people out when they found out the truth. Still not as many \\"events\\" going on as in the first. The first was much better. Still a unique new way to bring \\"horror\\" to the screen.<br /><br />Side note. I want that house.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Música que inspira. Preciosa música para una banda sonora o  para acompañar cualquier momento del día.<br />Muy recomendable.<br />La aconsejo

B000SJJCX4|5.0|I got tired of my old tuners finicky nature(having to use harmonics),so after the new Bass Head amp from Behringer I thought why not,I'll try their Chromatic Tuner and...I loved the way it worked from the git go.Easy to read and easy to use.5 stars and 2 thumbs up.
B0012QRPU4|2.0|Flash was a bad technology when it was being supported. It's even worse now, on top of being obsolete. It doesn't work correctly (when it works at all), it crashes, the audio often gets out of sync (especially if you try to rewind or fast forward), it runs all of my processors so hard that the fans come on and ruin the viewing experience. It's just terrible in every way. I am running the latest version of Adobe's flash player (all of my software is always up to date).<br /><br />The show is really good. I'd give it 4 stars (and that's a lot considering the general quality of television these days) if watching it weren't ruined by Flash player. I'll be watching the rest of the series on netflix.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show!!!  This season is generally all about the war, but still very interesting.  I think season one is my fav.

B005IQZB14|3.0|Although I admired Cheryl for attempting such a daunting task, she clearly was not prepared for what she took on.  I found that I couldn't relate to her in any way, and therefore did not enjoy the book as much as I expected or my friends did.

B0006GVJEE|5.0|It should be noted that folks have been posting effusive praise for this movie here for 14 years. That should tell you something, dear reader.<br /><br />Let me first say that if you're avoiding this film because you think it's sleazy or you're uncomfortable with the idea of a relationship between an older man and a 14 year old girl (played by an 11 year old,) trust me... you're denying yourself a supremely well crafted, brilliantly acted and deeply moving film.<br /><br />Natalie Portman's appearance (her first film job) is, and I know this sounds crazy... is one of the single most remarkable female film performances I've ever seen. And I've been watching films for over fifty years.<br /><br />I'm going to leave it at that, except to say that this is one of the most riveting and moving love stories I've ever been fortunate enough to find. One of my ten favorite films of all time. And a great introduction to a great director.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|My first Joe Bonamassa purchase, most of his music I heard on Satellite radio, I am not disappointed with this purchase.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|As a big fan of the British original series (three series in fact) I avoided this US remake when it aired. I ended up watching all the first season episodes streaming over a weekend, and was fantastically and blissfully surprised. Just genius stuff.<br /><br />The entire cast even down to the smallest roles are exceptional, and this may be Kevin Spacey's very, very best work, a tour de force. His character is simply an amoral monster, a man with zero redeeming qualities.<br /><br />I'd specifically compare the British versus US versions but I don't want to give any of the plot away. I will simply say to any UK version fans that you'll find enough similar plot lines to please you, but endless diversions from the original that almost make it an entirely new story.<br /><br />If you're a fan of supremely high TV production quality, great writing and great acting, grab this set. And if you're a political junkie, you'll find this as rewarding as West Wing. High praise I know, but I think quite true.<br /><br />Enjoy. Then think about moving to another country. Because there ARE monsters under our bed. With very seductive smiles and very, very sharp teeth.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Though there are aspects of this book that I liked, overall, reading it was painful.  Too often when writers try to show teenagers struggling with the philosophical aspects of life and death, the dialogue comes across as forced.  Sadly, John Green falls into this trap.  Very rarely do the interactions between Gus and Hazel ring true.  There were many times I wanted to skip ahead so I wouldn't have to continue reading the unnatural dialogue between the two characters.  If he had stuck with the simple moments, this book could have worked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game for my daughter and she loves it. In great quality and great entertainment to keep kids quite for a while I would rate 5 stars
B001E3AXGS|5.0|this made the movie Lincoln soooo much better!!!! Gave me a much better understanding of a great man - maybe at times made him a little more human with a few faults (politically speaking)!!!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like to play Temple Run, this is a futuristic version. Instead of evil monkeys chasing you, you're chased by a cop and his dog. You get to fly with a jetpack and you have moving obstacles to challenge you.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not what I had expected but wanted to give it I a try. Not sure I liked  the content but kept me intrigued. Upon finishing I am interested in the next one however.
B005LAII3U|3.0|Being a big fan of the original Total Recall, I wasn't sure how I felt about them making an updated version, especially because the original is now on Blu-ray and looks amazing. I decided to check this out and see how it fared.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />The visuals in this movie are great. I really like the world they created, and the digital effects are very convincing. The set design, costumes and make-up are all first rate, and I have to give props to the designers for creating an imaginative and convincing future. The director also has an eye for interesting composition, and frames the movie well. This movie was fantastic to look at. Comparing this to other Blu-rays on the market, the clarity and fidelity are superb. The action sequences are pretty intense, so if you like lots of firefights and explosions, this shouldn't disappoint. The music and sound effects are fitting, and the audio quality is what you've come to expect from a Blu-ray disc. I don't have 5.1 surround, just stereo, so I can't comment on surround sound, but in stereo is sounded fine.<br /><br />THE MEH<br />The acting is not bad. Nothing stood out, but there weren't any particularly bad actors that distracted from the film. I am a big fan of Breaking Bad, so I especially enjoyed seeing Bryan Cranston as the villain, but he wasn't given enough screen time to stretch is acting chops beyond, \\"Hi, I'm the bad guy\\". I have no opinion of Colin Farrell one way or the other, but in this movie he did a decent job. As the lead, he held his own, but just barely. Everyone else was forgettable.<br />Another area that could have used some work is the pacing. The film seems to be in 5th gear the whole time, and refuses to let up even at the end. The problem this creates is that it becomes a predictable pattern. Characters give a little bit of uninteresting exposition, then a 20 minute chase ensues, replete with gunfire and explosions, then they have a 2 minute breather with more exposition, then another 20 minute chase, then exposition, then chase, and so on. Without proper pacing, the \\"big revelation\\" of who Douglas Quaid really is, followed by another \\"big revelation\\", has no impact on the audience because the actors seem too exhausted from the last 20 minute chase to really give a darn.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />This script is seriously lacking. There are no memorable lines, with the exception of lines borrowed from the 1990 film, and there's even a few scenes that makes small nods to the original film, which only serve to remind you of how much this version is lacking. There are three big problems with the script. First, it focuses way to heavily on the action sequences, and barely leaves room for story and character development. Second, the dialogue is really boring. Characters don't have anything particularly interesting to say, and don't have a clever or engaging way of saying it. I felt more like the characters were reading a synopsis off the back of the box rather than having natural conversations. Third, the story is too thin. This is really apparent when you compare it to the original. So much happened in that movie, so many twists and turns, so many interesting locations, so many characters, and they all seemed to have personality and purpose. The new Total Recall strips away the layers of depth from the original and all we're left with is a skeleton of a plot, a 2 hour movie with 6 minutes of story and 114 minutes of gunfire.<br />One final gripe, and this is more personal preference than anything else, but the characters seem invincible. Throughout the movie, dozens of trained police officers with semi-automatic weapons fire at the protagonists, miss every shot, then the protagonists will fire a couple shots and hit their mark flawlessly every time. Some of these police officers are robots, and even they miss. You'd think if they can build robots in the future, they could program some competent auto-aim software as well. It got pretty ridiculous in one scenewhere Quaid is surrounded by nearly 100 police officers in a building lobby, all of them aiming assault weapons at him and his partner. Logically the two protagonists surrender, since fleeing would be suicide. But then after a brief conversation, the two flee anyway and escape without a scratch. 100 cops, that have them completely surrounded and have been aiming at them for the last five minutes, are unable to hit two people standing in the middle of an open lobby in broad daylight!? WHAT?<br /><br />OVERALL<br />If you like seeing special effects in High Definition, rent this movie. It looks pretty, but it's not very memorable. If you don't already own the 1990 original, go buy that one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a awesome game best part its free Ive had it for a will it ks really fun I recomend u git it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very good game but needs to get buckets in pocket edition. My crops won't grow because they're not next to water...
0307593525|5.0|This is a classic.  It is nice to use as reference and to learn to perfect your cooking techniques.  This is not a quick recipe type cookbook.
1781164150|5.0|Great movie ...  Great book!<br />I don't buy a lot of &#34;Art Of&#34; books ..  but I'm glad I bought this one.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I just don't see all the twists people are talking about. I found this book to be predictable all but the last chapter (spoiler alert)where her only friend ends up being the ghost of her love interests wife....wow. It's a quick read but I just didn't get emotionally attached like I usually do. Mediocrity at it's best.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The storylines are bland, and character deaths are in season.  SPOILER:  The youngest daughter is most disposable, so she dies.  The male romantic lead (Matthew) dies because the actor refused to extend his contract.  Rather sudden, isn't it?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun. I love to get the new updates. I think that it is fun for all ages and like temple run but I enjoy this better. This is very close to temple run and I think it is just way better and it is free too
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Having played a backgammon game on my wife's iPad (and beating it like a rented mule), I was a bit wary of trying one on the Kindle. This one, however, was quite excellent.<br /><br />The different levels of play enable a person to improve their game. The usage of the doubling cube by the AI is quite good (it does know when it has the advantage and also realizes when it is beaten). The graphics are pleasant and the ease of usage is very good.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good quality backgammon game - and not something that you can beat easily - this one's for you.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|After seeing the documentary:  Searching for SugarMan, I knew I wanted to listen to some of Rodriguez's music again.  I had to be dragged to see a documentary about a musician.  But, the Academy got it right when the documentary received an Oscar.  Fantastic story, and music which certainly should not have been lost for so long.  This is worth listening to again and again.

B007N8RULO|5.0|Love to play this game.  It was strange at first because it is not like the Spider Solitaire on our Windows 7 Pro.  But I really do love playing it now.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|My Book Club read it and we all loved it. If you like historical fiction, and can stomach some of the horrors of slavery, this book is for you!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a very, very good read.  Overall I liked it a lot, however wasn't a huge fan of the ending.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|My lense collections was starting to grow and a little camera bag was not enough room. I needed something easy to carry but that would carry everything I wanted. This is a great backpack. I am older with back issues and this feels very comfortable, padded and balanced. Lots of room for many lenses, my camera, my tripod and many other items cause it is loaded with compartments and little pockets. You can buy a name brand one or get this one for a lot less.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It is a quick read that everyone should read with a open mind and heart. We should all follow this path : )
B008133MDK|5.0|Excellent! I was entranced! I cannot wait until the next season! Benedict is exactly as I would picture Sherlock Holmes would be now!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The man I am interested in (now boyfriend) recommended that I read this book. I've also heard it referenced several times on K love, I looked up info online, I've heard him in an interview, so I finally got the book. I have to say... I am impressed. I research love and relationships because the psychology of a long lasting marriage intrigues me. Point is.... My boyfriend and I have a great time filling each other's &#34;tanks&#34;  and asking each other what we can do to fill it.  I couldn't ask or pray for a better man. And I don't know how I do it but I fill his tank all the time and he is so appreciative! It doesn't even feel like work. I recommend this book to anyone who is in a relationship, single, divorced, etc. It's important to see what you're language is and what you need out of a relationship.

B00000ICN5|5.0|If you only plan on getting a few of his albums, this is one of the three you must get.  &#34;Couldn't Stand The Weather,&#34;  &#34;In Step,&#34; & &#34;Texas Flood&#34; are the three essentials.  Then again, why stop there?  If there is one album I could say a SRV COULD do without, it would be &#34;Family Style.&#34;  But if one HAD to limit their SRV collection, this one is indispensable.
B00133KHCY|5.0|This movie was my all time favort movie and love it.  I recommend that you buy this movie and see it.  You will enjoy it as much as I did.  It has a happy ending.
B0094OLJD0|4.0|Let's face it David Byrne has never been your &#34;conventional&#34; pop artist/musician.  Which has always been part of the charm for me, but simultaneously when he's gone too far off a tangent, I get turned off.  Overall this album walked on that razor's edge for me from start to finish.  There are absolute moments of brilliance and some really original musical ideas, but some of those ideas went a bit too far and wandered into the &#34;just noise&#34; realm.<br /><br />It wasn't nearly as easy to listen to as the &#34;Everything That Happens Will Happen Today&#34; album with Brain Eno, but I think the more I listen to this one, the more I will enjoy it.  I am thoroughly unfamiliar with St Vincent and her works, but I will be looking into them now.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I agree with the review that was posted to the left; could not of said it better myself. A truly magnificent, beautiful film.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I downloaded this app for myself, and I think it's pretty fun. Of course, not everyone is going to like it, unless of course, you're a brony or a little kid. I play it every now and then, only to collect my money and to play a few mini games with the ponies, and that's about it for the day. Other than that I think it's a good game for almost everyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers in my opinion is way better than temple run or any other game like it. It is also<br />free. Get this game!
B008OOYALE|2.0|Its impassable to get new pets! Does this look like the rich house? Well I live in a poor house! Just kidding. Like really For the other pets the lowest priced one is 20 golds! Not a nice and friendly game. Like they only want money. Make the prices lower! JESUS!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A very well written book that kept me entertained. He seems to have really thought out and researched the space tech to the point where it seems like most of it would work. It got a little over detailed at times, but what do you expect from a book narrated by a NASA astronaut.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Five Star Movie - Zero Stars for Double Dipping AGAIN with extended version... Sigh. I remember discussing this years ago with the original LOTR releases. Gotta double-dip and release a theatrical version and then the extended edition. Anyway, enough about that.<br /><br />[QUICK SPOILER BELOW - But seriously, you didn't see this already?]<br /><br />The movie brings back the magic of LOTR in a big way. Not quite up to par but very close (really I think some of the comedy was just stupid - such as when Gandalf killed the Goblin King and the Goblin King said \\"That'll do it!\\" - Whoever wrote that gem should be drug out on the street and thoroughly flogged.).<br /><br />Other than that silliness (actually just that one part gets to me), the rest is LOTR goodness!! I saw this in 48FPS (and also regular IMAX) and I gotta say 48FPS was like being inside the movie (after a 10 minute adjustment period to get used to it). I hope the 48FPS extended edition bluray comes out quickly. That's what I'm holding out for and that is what I recommend you hold out for!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so real. Like watching a live horse and taking care of It.<br />I recommend this game !!! Try it.

B004SGWYW4|4.0|This DVD is beyond expectation of which all 12 episodes are found to be highly entertaining except that it heavily tests the sexual Desire of the male characters. The limit that this DVD caused people to see it was to be highly desired, except that it doesn't have the 15 minute short.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|We have been waiting for the Blu-ray version of the original Star Wars trilogy for a very long time and went ahead and purchased the entire set with the behind the scenes extra.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is an excellent James Bond 007 film with a bit of a different spin.  Instead of just a fast action pedal to the metal spy flick this one includes more drama and details into the origins of James Bond and the issues within the British Secret Service.  I will not go into the plot and put spoilers into this review.  I will only say that it does include a lot of chase scenes, action, beautiful women and of course the always cool James Bond.<br /><br />The thing that makes this Bond film different is the in-depth insight into the stress, both physical and mental, that agents like James Bond endure while doing their jobs.  This made the film a great 007 movie along with being a good drama with suspense. I thought this film featured great acting and special effects but I also enjoyed the emotional and personal side of the story.<br /><br />This film seemed to be the first step of kick starting the 007 movies into a new type of film for the next 50 years.  I started reading Ian Fleming's 007 books 50 years ago and I loved every one of them.  This new transition made by this film will make the series of new films even more interesting and enjoyable.  This was an attempt to refresh the characters and breathe new life into the James Bond saga.  I liked it a lot!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|A great movie for the whole family! Wonderful animation and excellent story line. Characters are well developed and the story was easy to follow for all my boys age 5, 9, and 12.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've had to uninstall this app twice because it wouldn't work. Other than that I love it!! Get that problem fixed!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie was really wonderful and well done.  At first, I thought it would be simple and straightforward, just like the book, but I was so happy to see Jackson and Co. put in all the elements of the Tolkien world that were going on at the time Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves made this journey.  Before looking at bad reviews of how long the movie is, consider that Jackson isn't one for deviating from the books unless it is vital to do so.  In fact, there was not nearly as much deviation as folks think.  Tolkien actually wrote about most of the &#34;extras&#34; in Appendix A of Return of the King, as documents from Gimli, Gloin's son (Gloin who was actually part of Thorin's company of dwarves).  The necromancer was actually mentioned in The Hobbit, though it was not a main focus, and Gandalf did express worry about Sauron potentially using Smaug as a weapon against the forces of good.  What we tend to forget is that Tolkien spent years world building Middle Earth before he even wrote The Hobbit, and that there was considerably more going on than could fit into the initial book.  The Hobbit is written from Bilbo's perspective, and so we are limited to the world view of a simple, or not so simple, Hobbit.  Hence, we get the fast paced, delightful journey.  But if one delves deeper into the Tolkien realm, we discover the burden Thorin II Oakenshield actually bore, which was excellently portrayed by Richard Armitage, and we see that he is essentially set up as an emotional foil for Bilbo.  We see all the characters, dwarves, wizards, elves, and hobbits alike, grow and change within the confines of a few hours.  Jackson has provided the deeper human essence that Tolkien's light hearted tone alludes to.  This is not a flaw with Tolkien's style; in fact, if one reads the Poetic Edda and the Volsungs, Both of which were the basis for his Middle Earth, one can see the depth of Tolkien's works in ways which many modern readers may not be able to if unfamiliar with those centuries earlier works.  All in all, I feel that this film has captured the essence of Tolkien's world and has made me a very happy lady!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just wish it was a little easier to obtain diamonds without buying them. I really should be able to earn them what sense does it make to buy them?
0307887960|5.0|Excellent, well written book.  Easy to read and follow.  Anyone could do this diet.  You don't have to starve and it teaches you how to eat to live not live to eat.
B008MM9630|4.0|something you can relax and enjoy with or withoutyour kids. easy enough for the kids to do alone.. lots of fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it... such a great story. Would recommend to anyone. Can't wait to see the movie! Hope it's like the book!
B00136Q6DA|5.0|You know that. Her voice is angelic and her songs uplifting. I listen to her all the time and never tire of hearing her.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This series has captured me from the first episode, and I love being able to watch and rewatch my favorite episodes.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is extremely addicting. I play it whenever I get a spare minute, and my skills are constantly increasing. Play!
B001P1MZNI|3.0|Good but not the best Sinatra that I've heard. Kind of cool that it is live from a Las Vegas iconic venue.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I was addicted to this game for a month or two, and certainly the high variety of available dragons is the reason. I love that they are constantly adding new breeds to the game as well.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|My daughter had this game loaded on her own Kindle Fire and had me try it. My right side is impaired so I have only crude dexterity with my right hand so am frequently looking for &#34;games&#34; that I play with my disability. I love Mahjong games anyway and within a few days it was available for free and I downloaded onto my new Kindle Fire but I would have bought it once I had my new device set up.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Well executed, Maggie Smith is quick with a quip and this show is a great mix of drama, soap opera, and amusing dialog.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The sounds are great and its easy to use. I turn it on to help my baby sleep, works great!
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|This is a great film, that finaly receives the deserved treatment from Criterion. The image and sound quality are great! Recomend to everyone interested in contemplative films, and the western genre!
B002XD8KEU|3.0|when we started watching this HD movie we had to leave the room and allow the movie to download because the HD was taking everything out of our poor internet wifi connection.  So we decided to watch the movie hours later, hoping the problem had been solved.  The movie was kind of silly at first, it definitely had a slow start, but eventually, towards the end it made sense, for some of our family members that was too late as they stopped watching somewhere in the middle. Would I watch again, probably not, it's ok but I may find a book with a real story to hold my attention longer, and more vividly.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I actually put it on my Kindle and I love it.  I have been a Phillip Phillips fan from the moment in his audition and just love him more. This CD does not disappoint!
1591843790|5.0|I've come across several marketing books, some are like textbooks, which are filled with strange terms and really hard to grasp the ideas right away.  As a business owner, when I read something I want to be able to decipher right away what the author is telling me, the way Guy Kawasaki wrote this book is excellent because he was very straight forward and gave examples.  I really find a lot of the issues he discusses very easy to understand and some gave me a new perspective to the marketing field in business.  I was able to combine what I read with my personal development as a human being, all the skills we get to learn through several different books on selling, time management, personal development, and relationships came together with this book, it made me realize how everything can be connected and coherent. The other thing about the book, it's very short, although I wanted to continue to read, the book simply ended, which is good because you get to read it again! I recommend to any small business owner, it can be the difference between a marketing campaign that helps the business grow and one that simply wastes resources.  Great easy reading loaded with useful information!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great to play while I'm in the car. Avatar doesn't move to rotation. AWESOME! The best game I ever played.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Easy to play with nice daily rewards<br />Different characters to suit different styles of play<br />Lots of different levels to continue to challenge
B005HEFB6M|5.0|The Star Trek series evolved and became less of an exploration space opera and more of a balance of power war drama. This last chapter is more reminiscent of the original series.  The one that ran in reruns throughout the eighties.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This DVD is great because it only uses the words from the book.  They don't create new dialog that was not in the book.  I am making movies this year with my elementary school class and have been using this DVD to teach them about non-verbal interactions and the fact that, just because you are not saying a line doesn't mean you can't interact and tell a story.  The movie is 30 min. long and most of that time is non-verbal interactions as the mouse goes along on his adventure.  Very well done.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|David Arnold has yet to disappoint me in his venture into Bond's world. This is my favorite score of his, and one of the best 007 scores to this day. Although he retains some elements, Arnold dropped alot of electronics used in the Brosnan run, and uses a more melodic approach. The main title song really isn't as godawful as everyone makes it out to be, but it's nothing special either. The most I can say about it is..well, it's not as bad as Die Another Day, or LuLu's song for Man with the golden gun (which to this day, gives me nightmares.) The quieter tracks are the more standout ones, for me. These are/include : Greene & Camille, No interest in Dominic Greene, Night at the Opera, What's keeping you awake?, Forgive Yourself, Camille's Story, The dead don't care about vengeance, I never left (and available on iTunes for a dollar - which is well worth it - Crawl, End Crawl by Four Tet.) The action material is great too, and still includes quieter moments, some of the best in the series for Bond's broken hearted, and troubled psyche. I would definitely recommend picking this, and Casino Royale up, as they contain some of the best cues from all 23 Bond movies.
0142403873|5.0|I have read this book to my 1st and 2nd grade classes for the past two years.  They love it and are spellbound as I read it.  I have then shown them the DVD, which is also excellent.
B00B6DTWM2|3.0|The entire movie builds up to a huge discovery and real intrigue in the antagonist and then suddenly just cuts off, I was not expecting a happy ending, but the ending I got was worse off than that, It's abrupt and the main antagonist really only appears for about one minute of run time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was not happy in the way that Season 3 ended but I am sure season 4 will take care of that problem Need more similiar DVD's to watch. You feel like you are part of the family in that era.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This book was a light read, nothing too intense or complicated for me to follow, which just left me wanting a little more from Robin Sloan. I appreciated that the romance between the main character and the Googler is a secondary plot line, if that, meaning it didn't take over the subject of the book. I wasn't in it for a soppy romance and thankfully Sloan didn't give it to me. Intrigued by the same curiosity that the main character had over never looking at the books, Sloan pulled me in quickly and kept me entertained throughout the book with this weird mix of new-age innovations and old school.... books. I'm interested in reading more by this author but I see potential in this book that was not discovered - turning the weird club into something much more than what it is. Although the end of the book makes me think more is coming and I just need to be patient.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Very gripping book and impossible to put down. Sometimes the rough writing style is distracting, it's not very graceful, but the story makes up for it with lots of twists and impossible sub plots. I do recommend the book to those looking for a highly distracting, entertaining evening.
B009NCM248|5.0|I got this CD because it was being offered for just a few dollars. It was absolutely worth it. I was surprised when I started listening to this CD, and I've like it quite a bit. I had no idea they were heavy like this. I'd only heard a couple of their songs and non of them were heavy. Thus the surprise. I wound up buying another CD because this one was so good. I anticipate the part two release, I'll buy that too.
0486274268|5.0|I've mainly stuck to drawing portraits of friends and family members but have wanted to explore how to draw animals. This book is filled with beautiful drawings that are also accompanied by a short explanation and a rough sketch as well to show you the process of the artist at work. It is incredible at teaching you the anatomy of deer, bears, horses, etc, explaining how they move while also giving skeleton and muscle drawings to help you grasp how the animals body should look. There are also a few more cartoon-looking drawings as well if you are interested in drawing in a more toonish style. The writing is brief but tells you exactly what you need to take from the drawings being shown. I sat down and done some quick 10 minute sketch work and was blown away with how well my sketches came out. I love this book!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|game is cool I really enjoy all the puzzles and finding the objects and figuring out how to use them. I will be telling all my friends and about g5 games. impressed
B00BKVK0MG|4.0|I've been follow this series for some time and I love it. Suspenseful, scary, and full of surprise in every episode. I enjoy every characters arc and how they all become a cohesive family unit. However, I've notice near the opening scene the Governor of Woolbury is pulling the dressing off his damaged left eye then towards the end of the episode where Andrea is in bed with Governor's now his patch is over his right eye instead of his left eye that is suppose to be damaged. I don't know if this intentional or a spoof for future out takes for a DVD gag reals. For crying out loud that's just too funny!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for his Valentine's Day present and it was the perfect gift!  He loves Minecraft and anything to do with Legos, so this one was a no-brainer.  All the pieces were there and once it's built, the piece actually comes apart in sections that can be rotated and explored, it really is a mini-Minecraft world.  This is for gamers and kids and kids-at-heart. Great product!
B0000024K1|5.0|Public Enemy has been doin it for decades now with Chuck D as the lead and Flava Flav as their hype it's the perfect 1 2 punch I'd recommend this album to anyone who loves hip hop at its purest form
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great film, start to finish on the edge of the seat.  Affleck deserved at least a nomination for director.<br />Well deserved Oscar for best film.
B000000WFF|5.0|This album is classic matter of fact all of them are they have great harmonies and individuality I'd recommend it to anyone who likes good pop music
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Proof there are happy endings everywhere, although they may appear differently than the ones you would have chosen for yourself. This book highlights silver linings in the messed up moments of life. Read it of you want a few laughs and some positivity.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. If you havent seen it you MUST watch it, seriosuly so great. And this is actually a really great deal price wise for this movie on blue ray.
B00003CXMG|5.0|The soundtrack of this movie is what attracted me to it.  Then after watching it, I realized it's a great movie too!  Highly recommended.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|I like this CD. And if you love Lady Gaga then you will love this CD. I like her and just wanted to listen to her music for when I work out because some of her stuff gets me real pumped up, so it has been working good for me. For the price, since this is a double disc, it is really good, I saw it in stores for like twenty something.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|It is totally not what I expected and I feel like I wasted my money.  I want my money back!!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Addictive! Fun! This game is easy and it sucks you in w without you even realizing it! A good friend recommended this game to me. So, from one friend to another, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is definitely a must have dungeon hunter. The graphics are fine and gameplay is never get and smooth. It is possible to beat the game without having to buy any glu credits. Five stars all the way.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All the characters were unique in their own way. I really looked forward to each episode. Please do a Season 4.
B0053O89JM|1.0|item arrived on time, no complaints there... It seems the last two discs of this set are blank, they wont play in any of the 5 dvd players in my home :(

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|interesting & fun without being too complicated--love to watch it while I'm on the elliptical exercise machine at the YMCA--makes the time fly---no embarrassing nude shots to worry about other adults or kids seeing--good entertainment!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|After all these years the boys are still fun, fresh and kick ass. Great addition to the cast is Benny, hope he shows up again. My husband loves the show for the great stories, humor, scares and charcters.<br />I love it for the same reasons but confess I have a middle aged woman crush on the supernaturally handsome brothers in the story! I mean seriously, it should be a crime for two men to be that drop dead sexy.....ok I'll stop now.<br />I think there is something for everyone from this show but start from season one because the character development over the seasons is very important, lots of plot twists and I think you will enjoy the other characters as well.<br />Even the evil ones have a twisted sense of humor.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought that this book was so so so good!!!! I liked were it started because it picked up right were the second book left off.  I was thrilled with the way the book was written an I absolutely love the way all the characters blend together but are so different at the same time. I will not spoil the ending,but with that end I was so upset I complained for three days. I HATE STUPID CLIFFHANGERS!!!!!
B005FVA3LK|4.0|I'm a huge U2 fan.  The art that comes with this alone is worth this set.  I find it kind of odd that they included a Zooropa CD in with this but ahh well, clearly the band was in a mode with those two albums.  The alternative Achtung Baby album called Kindergarten that comes with this is a real treat as well as the DVD.  Did I mention how cool the artwork was?  A must have for the Uber U2 fan. :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun and addictive once you start you cant stop i started playing and got hooked love the game

B001UHOWXI|5.0|Great Classic !  Clean, wholesome entertainment. Most everyone takes time to watch this movie during the Christmas season.  I have always loved it.
0062238868|5.0|As Hemingway wrote, \\"All True Stories End in Death\\", which must be the footnote for Kyle's \\"American Sniper\\".  He wasn't killed in the heat of combat, as he would have preferred, but by a troubled ex-serviceman Kyle was trying to help.  Kyle was shot in the back reportedly for his pick-up truck.  A disgusting tragedy but, then again, it's the kind of tragedy that might happen to any of us.<br /><br />The book itself is an autobiography which a literature form that I usually avoid.  Initially I was a little put off by tales from Kyle's childhood and youth although they form the tapestry from which Kyle was created.  The story gets better--a lot better.  The story is about Kyle but is 'broken' by the writings of his wife as she undergoes the fears, angers and frustrations of a woman left alone while her warrior goes into battle--two entirely different points of view set side by side.  Fascinating.<br /><br />Kyle's many tales are honest and unapologetic.  He loves war and the thrill of combat.  He hates the enemy who he regards as soulless savages.  He is glad he kills them and only wishes he could have killed many more.  At the same time, he suffers the agonies of the Damned when his fellow warriors and friends are wounded and killed.  He writes--and this is unquestionably the truth--that he wishes that the bullet or shell fragment had hit him, instead.<br /><br />His wife, certainly, doesn't feel the same way.  She wants him home safe and sound but is, at the same time, angry at him for placing his duty--and battle joy--in front of his family.  She tells him on one of his times at home that 'if he reups for another tour in Iraq, it proves that he loves war more than his family.'  He reups and she draws the obvious--and no doubt correct--conclusion.  It is clear that, for Kyle, battle has become a drug to which he is irreversibly addicted.<br /><br />He doesn't have PTSD.  On the contrary, he has something quite different.  He has problems with high blood pressure which many people would attribute to the stress of battle.  Au Contraire.  Kyle tells us training in a realistic combat simulator that monitors his vital signs.  When engaged in the heat of combat, Kyle's high blood pressure returns to normal.  Fascinating.  Combat is not only an addictive drug, it's a therapeutic drug.<br /><br />I've often wondered whether something like this might happen to our President, Our Messiah and Anointed One, Barack Obama, and would LOVE to see him placed on a polygraph--a lie detector.  A polygraph records nervous reactions and 'baseline' shows up and down squiggles of various amplitudes.  If the subject should tell a lie, the fact that the subject is nervous about his lie oftentimes shows up as a jump in squiggle amplitude--IN PEOPLE WITH ORDINARY COMPUNCTIONS AGAINST LYING.  On the other hand, sociopathic people who spend much of their life lying, frequently show NO increase in polygraph background amplitude even when they tell real whoppers.  There might be people [our President?] whose polygraph background amplitude actually flattens out as they tell an egregious falsehood.<br /><br />In any event, \\"American Sniper\\" is an honest tale written by an opinionated man and his long-suffering wife.  It doesn't pull punches and it isn't politically correct.  It's the tale of a man who literally 'missed the bullet' in desperate combat only to be shot in the back by a loser who Kyle thought was a friend.ich many people would attribute to the stress of battle.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|very accurate description some reviews said flimsy not so stands up to my toddler and i really like it on occassion if i don't clasp band on it to close the auto awake function doesn't work but that is minor overall accurate sturdy and i'm pleased.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out and loved it.  I just had to have a copy for myself.  Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|meets my need allows alot of functions like on computer even though on cell or kindle good app great function
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD.  I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now.  Watch the movie if you have not seen it.  Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins .... when He was innocent of all sins.  Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind. All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul. He made that possible for us by taking on our sins.  Watch the movie.  Please !
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Didn't think it was going to be that good actually watched it a 2nd time I enjoyed it so much would recommend to anyone who likes music and laughs.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  I just wish it had been the black and white version.  Great Classic !
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig really makes a great James Bond and in this one he makes him human and not the super hero you think of from the older movies. Keeps you enthralled at all times waiting for what happens next.
0765325950|3.0|Like everyone else likely reading this review (and book), the Wheel of Time has been a good friend for a number of years.  Like most long friendships, we've had intensely good and intensely bad moments. At times we're inseparable; other times, it seemed like a year or two could go by without speaking.  That's OK.<br /><br />With this installment, of course, the friendship ends, and we're left with memories of the journey and the friendship itself.  Insert obligatory \\"memory of light\\" metaphor/reference here and...<br /><br />As a standalone review, the book clips along at a decent pace.  While the story IS about the Last Battle, like many I found the battle descriptions kind of repetitive and inexplicably inconsistent with other parts of the series. Many other reviewers detail this and other inconsistencies/problems elsewhere, probably better than I can.  Suffice to say: they're pretty much correct.<br /><br />However, I found myself almost wanting to skip ahead. While awash in minutiae of battles, I found myself hoping that the next page would contain details to close the loop on a story arc. When conclusion was given, it almost always seems rushed and thin.<br /><br />This is my big criticism. While the other books penned at the helm of Sanderson show what I thought to be a lot of liberty and vast improvement in writing and story style over Jordan, this one really reads like he was tightly constrained by a lengthy outline. He visited each point, eager visit each point like a scavenger hunt player ticking marks off of a sheet, without ever delving into detail.  I swear, it's almost like the list of important story arcs were dictated word-for-word by Robert (from beyond the grave) and Harriet with no allowance for variation, so Sanderson instead took license with less important aspects.<br /><br />Frankly I find Sanderson to be a better writer than this, and in that it's disappointing.  I'll accept the story (inconsistencies and all) for what it is.  Like all of my fond friendships, a little erratic behavior is OK.  I find the closing of the story to be sad, in that it's over, but I wish A Memory of Light would have stood up fully to its promise.  I think it could have, though it does miss the mark a bit.<br /><br />This does not make it horrible, just a little disappointing.  I do hope Sanderson picks up the universe for later story lines; I find the tableau fascinating and love Sanderson's treatment of it and I really like his writing style.fond friendships, a little erratic behavior is OK.

B00BESKTMG|4.0|Had really good fight scenes and Russell Crowe plays a good role in this. Have to watch it twice to really see all the action in the fight scenes because it happens so fast.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 did not dissappoint and there was never a boring moment. Look forward to Season 3. Highly recommend watching this wonderful/entertaining Masterpiece.
1616550414|5.0|The Hyrule Historia Book is great for both newcomers to the series and fans! The quality is great the images the info and about everything you'll find in it is very well displayed.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|I read this in preparation for world war z and enjoyed the quirky 'realism' of the book.  The accounts at the end were especially fun.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I SO appreciate access to news that doesn't come from our National media's politicized viewpoint.  There is a wealth of news options available, and the access page gives easy &#34;Netflix - Style&#34; content review.
B002ZG980U|5.0|So much fun to see how they use some of the computerized vizuals.<br /><br />Must have taken a long time on a computer farm, just to process all the graphics; not found on film.
B0050Q3TDY|4.0|I like this, as a diversion from Pandora.  It stays nicely in the genre selected, with a thorough selection of jazz styles.
B00049QQHI|4.0|First movie I saw Mr. Leo D. perform in.<br /><br />Moved by his performance, could have been given an early academy award for this movie!
B003TNW044|5.0|Had whole set of originals, lent it out, never returned. I love the replacement, same quality, but they did fit it into 1 box (1 DVD case) So it doesn't match the old (original) fold out style, but great price!
B006LSZECO|5.0|From the time I opened this book, it caught my attention. I loved it. I found myself reading it during work because I had to know what happened next ( don't tell my boss).
1616550414|5.0|Been waiting for a book like this to come out since the late 90's.<br /><br />Glad nintendo finally is investing in merchandise like this for their flagship franchises
B008OOYALE|5.0|I found it addicting didn't think I would get so caught up in it reason being that I only added it to get cash for another game
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Ever since we received this movie, it has played over and over and over again in our car. My kids can't get enough of Hotel Transylvania! It really is a very funny movie and I enjoy listening to it while I'm driving. We saw it when it was out in the theater and my kids were counting the days until we could buy it on DVD. The characters are all really great and give a unique twist to the typical scary creatures. I'm really hoping that they come out with a sequel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really adicting you should get it prepare to play it all day so get a charger and download this game¡!!

B004FRX0MY|1.0|I used to love using this app. It was quick, easy to use, and I could download songs anywhere......then they updated it......now i can't download anything unless I am connected to wifi, but in that case, why not just use my computer? This app now sucks....uninstalled.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Play the game every day! Love it. The only problem is that it is really hard to find gold or diamond on survival. It is so worth the $. It might be a lot of$ but u can create as many worlds as u want to. I give this game an a thousand star review if I could!
B007P06DJK|5.0|I had this on a cassette tape while in college. Loved it. My wife had never heard it. She recently saw a PBS program (the DVD in this set), and really enjoyed it.<br />I got this for her as a Valentine's Day present. I don't think it's left the CD player  in her car (except for when I copied it to my I-pod!)
B001P829VY|5.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Treasure of the Sierra Madre is excellent.  Details are crisp, and the contrast is strong.  There are about half a dozen moments scattered throughout the film where the quality goes bad, looking like an unconverted DVD.  But these only last for a few seconds each.  Apparently, they did not have good source material for those few scenes.  Otherwise, I was quite pleased.  The sound is okay, but not great.  Dialogue is fine, but the soundtrack hisses a bit, and the punches in a couple of fight scenes sound very weak.  Apart from these quibbles, this version is well worth owning.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful characters and dynamics.  Great generational story woven into the important events at that time.  There is a true to life unpredictability in the storyline and what happens to characters.  I like that even if it shocks me or makes me sad.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A well written dark quirky novel that can't be put down until finished. Love this author for her character development and for exploring the dark side just enough to seem real.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|It's been over a decade since The Fellowship of the Ring hit cinemas across the world, turning people who never gave fantasy (or three-hour movies) a second thought in to die-hard, Tolkien-lovers. Now, after years of studio politics and financial uncertainty, acclaimed director Peter Jackson has delivered the first part of a three-film adaption of J.R.R Tolkien's beloved (and significantly shorter) novel The Hobbit. The decision to turn the Hobbit into three movies, which came after principal photography was completed, was, and continues to be, a source of controversy among fans of both Jackson's films, and Tolkien's novels, but whether you have you reservations or not, we now have the first installment in theaters. So how does it hold up to the legacy of it's forebears?<br /><br />  The answer: its complicated.<br /><br />  Even though I didn't see The Hobbit in High Frame Rate 3D, the marks of a director who was shooting for this new format were very much present in the version that I viewed. It looks different, and a lot of times, its hard to say that that was a good thing. There were times where, because of the different style of lighting and the blocking of the scenes, I felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie, and other times where the cinematography was reminiscent of that of a BBC miniseries.<br /><br />  The pacing, too, was different than most other films. Faced with gleaning nearly nine-hours of footage from a 316-page novel, Jackson and the other writers were not only forced to make up new material, but also had to squeeze every second of footage that they could out of the book, and it shows; The Hobbit is paced like a book, not a movie. As such, it may come across as a little bit dull at times (even compared with the most drawn-out Sam and Frodo sections of The Return of the King) for those not already predisposed to being completely dedicated to the film.<br /><br />  The Hobbit is also a very different kind of film than The Lord of the Rings movies were. It is not an epic, it is a very personal, character-driven story about finding your place in the world. The Lord of the Rings, was a fantasy in a world brimming with weird creatures and odd magic, but still somehow grounded in reality, it made sense in a if-there-really-was-a-world-like-this-this-is-how-it-would-function sort of way. The Hobbit's Middle Earth, on the other hand, is a whimsical and often childish place, and full of humor to the point where I would actually classify it as fantasy/adventure/comedy. This is not the same genre as The Lord of the Rings (and rightfully so, as novels were very different as well) and anyone going into the theater expecting the same experience will come away disappointed.<br /><br />  Now a lot of what I've said sounds rather condemning, but there is another way to look at it. The Hobbit is an odd beast, filmed in a way we've never seen before, and written in a way that most movies aren't (and usually shouldn't be). But looking at the film as a whole, these things end up coming together to make a movie that is wholly unique, something that is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Yes, it won't have the mass appeal that The Lord of the Rings had, and in that sense, they were better movies, but Peter Jackson tried something different, and to a large extent, it pays off. The Hobbit does outmatch the previous films when it comes to the cast, who are all, especially the three leads, extraordinary.<br /><br />  The Hobbit harkens back to the original kind of adventure story or fairy tale, disturbing and frightening at times, yet funny and harrowing at others. It is, in the end, a very good movie; lightning has struck for New Line again, but in a very different place. I wouldn't want every movie to be made like The Hobbit was, with odd cinematography and slightly off pacing, but in this circumstance, it seems to work, all coming together to create the kind of on-screen fantasy spectacle that Mr. Jackson alone seems capable of crafting.<br /><br />8/10 (Very good)<br /><br />-Edit: 3.3.13-<br />  After seeing the film in HFR I can definitely say that while it did provide many 'oooh, ahhh\\" moments, it also provided a lot of moments that looked more at home on a 1990's BBC special or a soap opera. These moments pulled me out of the movie, and in my opinion, no amount of great moments can make up for even one that pulls the viewer out of the experience. That being said, the enjoyment of HFR will vary greatly on a viewer-to-viewer basis and I would encourage everyone to check it out on a second or third viewing of the movie (or on the upcoming sequels). New technology is always fun!
0439023513|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is a remarkable series of books, if for no other reason than its reception by the reading public. Long after the release of the first book of the trilogy I was still reticent to buy it, but finally I did, and I was shocked by the quality of the writing. More so by the cast of characters, the crucible, and the imaginative descriptions of Panem and its gloriously diverse cast of citizens. In the end, though, The Hunger Games Trilogy is simply a story about a young girl thrust by circumstance into the oppression of a Roman-type war on a personal level, a romantic see-saw, and finally all out war—the outcome of which is never really in doubt.<br /><br />You cannot easily or successfully review the last book, Mockingjay, without mentioning the first two. That would be akin to commenting on The Return of the King without mentioning its predecessors. Ms. Collins, however, succeeded in much the same way—though probably on a lower level—that Tolkien did. From the very first pages of The Hunger Games itself, I would hazard a guess that the vast majority of readers suspended disbelief immediately and immersed themselves in the dystopian world Collins masterfully created. I entered her Middle Earth and found myself mesmerized by two characters, Katniss Everdeen and arch-villain, Snow. Unlike the characters in Tolkien’s masterpiece, however, the dividing line between the heroes and villains becomes a bit more vague in Mockingjay. Snow remains true to character, certainly, but enter another villain in the person of President Coin—suspicious from the first pages. With Snow in the background battling Katniss behind the scenes, Coin emerges as an enemy equally virulent in her own way, bent on creating a new order that would perhaps not be as cruel as Snow's, but just as oppressive, using Katniss’s wildly popular persona as the means to her end. Katniss finds herself fighting on two fronts suddenly. I can only imagine how different the story wouldhave been had District 13 been a true place of refuge, governed by a just Coin, or (forgive me) a drunken Haymitch.<br /><br />Such is war--unpredictable while we are in the midst of it--and such are real people.<br /><br />Katniss is damaged at the outset, and naturally so, having killed so many characters, seen so many killed, and feeling responsible to a greater extent than justified for all of their deaths on a deep, personal level. Combine that with Peeta’s wholly distressing condition throughout, Gale’s unrequited love for the girl he grew up with, interest and suspense remain high and constant. I must say that the final journey to the Capitol is among the best and most tightly written series of scenes I can ever remember having read. There is doubt whether Katniss and her allies will foil the attackers time and again, and should they emerge in one piece, whether she (or they) will be able to clear the walls of the Palace and confront Snow. Even knowing she must win by book's end, and that somehow she will, that is great plotting.<br /><br />The one thing that I found myself “rebelling&#34; against from start to finish was the new Katniss, haunted by demons and not really in control. Not the center, the clear victor in a way. I must confess I wanted to see her not propelled forward by mere circumstance, but propelled by a less-damaged, clearly-focused mind. An outcome in which Peeta fully escapes the tortures he has endured. A happy ending, in control. But that is me, and what would one really expect in the real world? Peeta remains insane; Gale wins out in the end, marries Kat, and together they have ten children, and rule their new world justly. They live happily ever after, visiting Peeta daily…hoping. Of course Prim shows up after the conflict, unscathed, the finest medical mind of her generation.<br /><br />In thinking back on this, I’m glad Collins wrote a truly “real” book, mirroring the knowledge we have of the true ravages of war on theinnocent. Probably an epic that will stand the test of time in its genre.
055358894X|5.0|Beautifully written book. Though the story contains some heavy cliches, such as the main character being an orphan, it makes up for it in sincere literature, style, and a violently unfolding series of events that held both humor and grittiness much in the style of Joe Abercrombie. I've rarely seen such a good book that has such a horrible cover. I mean that thing is hideous. They should keep the old one with violet buildings and white pedals or whatever, the cover alone will turn most people away.<br />I became quite emotionally involved with some of the characters, and got much of the same feelings of shock i recieved in George Martin's third book of his Song and Ice and Fire series, \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" some of you will know what i mean by this.<br /><br />The book is not meant to be full of profound, philosophical depth- and instead quite adeptly accomplishes an original (despite the cliches) fantasy adventure.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is Diana Gabaldon's most exciting and riveting book of the Outlander series.  Once picked up, it was almost impossible to put down.  Definitely recomended reading.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good writing style and very homespun information of the SEALS part in the current wars centering around the most honorable service of Chris Kyle. Chris put you right in the middle of the fighting in his unique style of writing. One feels as though you are right there with him. A good working warrior's thoughts and feelings in the down and dirty fighting to protect our way of life as free people. From a personal standpoint I would be proud to have him as a friend. It's so hard to feel the pain of his family after his untimely passing.. A must read by anyone who honors our troops and service men and women and their families.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|love it!! all the early stuff and up to mid 90s, can't go wrong with this purchase at all!<br />great!!
1892005034|5.0|I totally enjoyed Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication.  He has a workable plan for everyone to communicate better with others.  His plan is logical and makes sense.  It is a compassionate plan to assess our needs based on our feelings.  We then can make requests from others to meet those needs.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|i think the storylines are even better than the first season love each episode more than the last one.  great show!
0307949508|5.0|Non-stop read.  I think I liked this one more than the first book.  The story is much different than the first book, so you don't necessarily have to read the first one to understand the story.  However, the first book is VERY good and it also gives you some background into the characters before you get into the remaining books.  Can't wait until this comes out in the movies!
B004XANKVO|5.0|So. when I first took this bag outta the box, I had quite a big shock. The bag was flat as hell, and looked NOTHING like 32 litres. Picking it up, it was quite a surprise how incredibly light it was.<br /><br />Fast forward, this monster can fit a WHOLE LOT of stuff.<br /><br />1) Right at the back is the laptop compartment. In this compartment there a sleeve/section specifically for a laptop. I have a 15.4&#34; MBP, and that thing fits in absolutely perfectly and snugly. It's briliiant. There's also some padding at the bottom where the laptop would otherwise meet the ground. I like that. apart from there, theres also a small sleeve area that fits a iPad perfectly and snugly. so if you're one of those who lug around a laptop and an ipad, this is just perfect. apart from that, this compartment would probably fit 1 other textbook or thin folder. There are also these 2 pockets near the top of this compartment. Incredibly handy for keeping small stuff. I use it to keep my earphone case, some pens, and my credit card holder.<br /><br />2) The main compartment: This is the monster. I generally keep 1 hugeass binder, 1 folder, 1 lab book and 1 textbook and 1 fat nalgene bottle (laid horizontally on top). I love how spacious this monster is. There are also 2 mesh pockets near the top, which I use to keep my magic mouse, a mini-display adaptor, a portable iphone charger and some cables.<br /><br />3) The safezone: i just bloody love this thing. I use it to keep all my non-so-tough electronics. I am usually able to put in my Canon S100 (which is inside a caselogic camera case so it's quite bulky), and sometimes a earphone. Don't expect it to be SPACIOUS enough to stuff tonnes of things. It's really meant for those couple of small stuff that are just fragile. Sunglasses, watches, camera, earphones etc.<br /><br />4) There's this shove-it compartment below the safezone. I love that spot. It's great for you to, well, shove any random things into it, esp if you need very ready access to them. The space can also be expanded by loosening the 2 buckles at the sides. for day-to-day I just shove my umbrella and lunch box there although if you want, you can loosen the buckles fully, and you can easily shove a pair of running shoes in there. The ONLY problem is, anything put there is vulnerable to the rain cos well, its not covered. Additionally, if you carry this bag out in the rain, water is gonna collect inside this compartment. It baffles me how they did not put like some kinda drainage holes at the bottom. Oh well.<br /><br />5) The front compartment: This is a nice roomy compartment good for shoving anything small and needs ready access. I usually put my mac charger, my graphics calculator, my pencil case and my spare sunglasses (in a case) in this compartment.<br /><br />6) There are 2 side pockets for you to put your water bottles and what not. One thing that might be a little annoying is that if you stuff the main compartment to the brim, it kinda obstructs any attempts to shove a bottle or stuff like that into the side compartment.<br /><br />7) The bottom compartment: so below the front compartment is this other compartment that literally lines the bottom of your bag. It's supposed to be for the MBP charger. I personally find it an awkward place (it's kinda tight and it's hard to push the charger in sometimes) and It makes your bag sit weirdly on the ground unless you managed to get it perfectly  fitted in.<br /><br />Overall, this bag is preeeeetty much close to perfect. It's got MONSTER volume for keeping just about everything. The construction is BLOODY solid - the buckles and zippers are some kinda metal (i think its aluminum), the fabric is solid and durable and there's double stitching at most places. I also think the designers at Thule are absolutely brilliant. The compartments are actually incredibly practical and useful. Plus I think it looks pretty damn good. I'm NOT sure if it's suitable for people who are slightly smaller inbuild though. It could be a little too big for their frames.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This is such a great movie, that I had to have the hard copy of it.  Unfortunately, this DVD will not register or play on my macbook or another PC laptop.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|Classic Tim Burton. I loved the look, and unbelievable characters. However, for dog lovers like my wife, the story was way too emotional. She was in pain for most of the movie.

0316228532|1.0|Maybe it's me but I could NOT get into this book at all. I barely made it to 85 pages and gave it away. I felt she is way too wordy and it seemed to drag on and on before getting to any point. I just wanted to throw the book against the wall I was so bored with it. I had a really hard time concentrating on the story. I love the Harry Potter books and read them all no problem, just not too thrilled with this attempt.....

B004EPYZP8|5.0|The lawyer showed you how to hustle in a legal way. I really enjoyed this movie. It's a must see
B004LOJPLQ|4.0|This is a great film for entertainment purposes. Mark Wahlberg does some of his best work in this film and the attention to details for &#34;retro&#34; props is FANTASTIC! However, the important key to staying close enough to a true story for the work to be considered a true story this writer and director failed. Let your fingertips take you on a search engine excursion and look up the real facts and you shall see for yourself. I would HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who likes boxing, Wahlburg, or just wanting to be entertained.

B000SW2F8K|3.0|Penelope Cruz is so hot that anything she is in practically burns a hole in the projector screen. That said this is kind of a mediocre movie for her. She does a great job no doubt about that but her role / character is oddly boring and I found I wasn't able to watch the movie all the way to the end.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Really enjoying it!  I can't wait to get the second season so I just ordered it and it should arrive soon.  Yippee!
B000PY6BBI|2.0|Wow the music is so mismatched that I couldn't get past the first 20 minutes or so. This is an older movie and the lack of technical quality definitely makes it look dated. Add to that the painfully weak dialog and acting (by some characters) and you have a potentially wasted two or so hours. Not my cup of tea.
B0018BZEOC|5.0|Kevin Smith is a better director than most. A fresh take on the Bible and the cast is classic View Askew.
B000NTMWYU|5.0|I thought this movie was touching and interesting.  Needless to say, it made me wish I was there!

Enjoy!

0385503954|5.0|There’s something so terribly truthful and romantic about lovers pulled apart by war…especially wrongfully. What if it took your entire life to realize you have been in love? What if you were able to find each other only to be torn apart by your family?<br /><br />Welcome to Cecilia Tallis and Robbie Turner’s lives. Growing up as neighbors, Robbie’s mother worked for Cecilia’s parents and in exchange, Cecilia’s father provided for Robbie’s Oxford education and acted as a father figure to him. When Robbie finally returns from medical training in London, Cecilia could not be more annoyed by her father’s displaced affections and her family’s blatant showering of money on the Turner family. As an up and coming society lady, Cecilia cannot simply be bothered with the commonness of Robbie. However, noticing Cecilia’s distantness since college, Robbie writes her a love letter to end all love letters and waits for her reply. However, this is where romance goes awry. Cecilia’s younger sister, Briony, reads the letter first, and detecting a few foul words, instantly thinks the worst of her beloved Robbie. The plot quickly thickens when Briony catches Cecilia and Robbie in an intimate embrace. Later that night, foul fate intervenes when a family friend rapes Briony’s cousin. When Briony catches a glimpse of a man, she is instantly certain that that man is the distasteful Robbie. When Briony’s cousin is found, Briony testifies against Robbie. At this point, Robbie is given the option to choose between going to war or rotting in jail. Robbie chooses to fight in World War II for his freedom and to get back to Cecilia. Cecilia refuses to talk to Briony and enlists as a nurse to be closer to Robbie. Years after the death of all of her family, Briony looks back on her poor actions as an author and chooses to reveal the mistakes of her past.<br /><br />I simply cannot sing enough praise for this book. Originally published in 2001, it is often cited as McEwan’s best work; it is beautifully written, historically correct, and so romantic. The best part about this book is the ending; rather than your traditional reunited-lover’s ending, this book has a very Romeo and Juliet twist. You can only guess at the tragedy that families had to experience at this time when they were forced to send their children off to fight their battles and more often than not, their children did not come home. Take from that what you will.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves love stories, World War II literature, or star-crossed lovers.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The best series I have ever watched bar none...I have watched it three times and will no doubt watch it again...Aaron Sorkin is a genius
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is a great show.  No indecency or bad language.  Drama, romance,  just fun entertainment that draws you in.  When it's over you can't wait for the next season.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun everyone should get it. I love hob yo can get mystery boxes LOVE. THIS GAME
B006JRY2QG|5.0|I'm not much of a biker, but this show was recommended by a number of friends and family so I decided to check it out. Once I started I couldn't stop. I think I watched the first 4 seasons in a month. Just when you think it couldn't get crazier, the plot goes to whole new levels.
1439156816|5.0|The second half of this book should be the writer's Bible. Read Anne Lamott's Bird By Bird, Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, and Mr. King's On Writing, then sit down, hack out a book, and wait for that call from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
B004SBX112|5.0|There are just enough less challenging episodes to prevent frustation with the rest.  Anyone can play this game...I am a 'senior' who just loves the birds
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another solid novel by Vince Flynn.  I like that this ending did not seem rushed like some others.  Cannot wait for the next one.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|I had to pay for something that won't download to my kindle fire.  If it is not meant to be on the kindle fire it should not be on my app purchases to buy.  I use my kindle fire for work and this would have been good for me to make short notes for my business while traveling.  If you can tell me how to download it please do.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Although slow moving, the movie is a sweet message about retirement and the emotions of this change to ones lifestyle.
B00AEK9BKQ|2.0|Sex, sex and even more sex is all that surrounds this 38 year old virgin.<br />Halfway through the movie, I was regretting watching it and wished I could turn it off. I couldn't though and give a real opinion. What if it came together at the end and I missed it?!<br />Well, I didn't miss squat.<br />It had a great group of actors, doing decent acting, with just an okay story. Really, it just wasn't my thing.
B000L3CHC0|2.0|I have owned this watch for almost a year now. The watch looks very nice and feels elegant and solid, but the hands of the chronograph now stop at the eleven o'clock position. I have been very careful with the watch and I haven't dropped it or damaged it in any way. I called Amazon (since I was aware that that Tissot would not cover a watch purchased at Amazon) and I will have to mail the watch (and pay for the delivery!) and then wait for 4 to 6 weeks to get an answer! and the repair itself could take even longer.  Very disappointed about the quality of the watch, since I didn't expect a 350 dollar watch to need repairs in less than a year. I'll keep you updated.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Not super impressed.  I liked my notes on my old iPhone better.  It was easier to get in and out of when I wanted to write a quick note.  Evernote is for more detailed notes it seems to me.
1616550414|5.0|Awesome! Worth every penny to any zelda fan!  I has so much nostalgia flipping through the cover arts to all the games I played in this wonderful series.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Bought this for my mom as a gift because she loves Ray Charles and many of the other artists featured in the duets. She loves it!!! It's something the whole family can enjoy together.
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|Its a nice watch, and I have received many compliments on it. But as others have said, the band clasp is strange. It is difficult to adjust (I had to use a screwdriver) and a few times has come undone while I was wearing it.
0765325950|4.0|It was great to see the series ending, but certain plot lines were never resolved.  What was the &#34;song&#34; that the Tinkers were looking for?  Still well worth the read.
0062206281|4.0|‘The Prisoner of Heaven’ is the third novel in the series that started with ‘Shadow of the Wind’. In this book, while it’s told from the point of view of Daniel Semper, we learn the ‘origin story’ of Fermin Romero de Torres.<br /><br />Fermin featured in ‘Shadow of the Wind’ as an accessory character who, while being strong and supportive, provided a comic relief. In ‘Prisoner’, set years before ‘Shadow”, we learn of his past and the true depths of the man. This is a man who is unjustly imprisoned in a hideous place (like many during the Franco r&eacute;gime) and barely escaped with his life, but never lost his humanity or his sense of humor. The horrific prison is probably a pretty good description of what really existed at the time, as well as the corruption, greed and fear.<br /><br />Unlike ‘Shadow’ and ‘The Angel’s Game’, the second in the series, this is a very fast read; it doesn’t have the intricate plotting that those two have. Sadly, the Cemetery of Forgotten Books is barely mentioned, there is no magical realism, and Daniel Sempere is acting a bit of an ass in his personal life. But Zafon’s writing is so beautiful that I would forgive him anything; it’s like the prose version of a piece of fancy, but tasteful, jewelry.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|WANTED THIS COLLECTION BRFORE THEY BAND IT BECAUSE OF GUNS, LOTS OF GUNS AND AMMO AND PEOPLE GETTING KILLED, JUST LIKE THE HISTORY OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY, GUNS MADE US FREE AND GUNS WILL KEEP US FREE!!!!!!
B007RTAR64|5.0|I purchased the doll for my grand daughter for Christmas and she was thrilled with it! It is very cute!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|If you're the fan of the Matrix movies and don't already own them this is a must have. Every movie looks and sounds great with tons of bonus content. I picked this box set up for basically nothing (60% off I think) but I would have paid full price any day. Shipping was good and fast, it's amazon.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really enjoy this series I have recommended this to friends I look forward to the next season . Watch season 3 on pbs
0671646788|5.0|Great book, I take it with me everywhere. It is written SO well and I think about the things I read in it during the day because they are just so simple and yet so powerful.
B001C08RHA|1.0|This was by far the worst DVD condition I have received. I mean just looking at the disk would tell you that it was junk. I know I did not pay a lot but really use some common sense. Will not buy from this seller again. I did arrive in a timely manner and was really looking forward to this dvd. Once Again I know I did not pay a lot but really it was junk.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved the first temple run. Maybe be I'm not talented at games. I was very excited to see Temple Run 2 come out. But my son and I were a little disappointed. It's wayyy harder. Which some people like I'm sure. It makes me dizzy because of the graphics. But I'm sure its fun once you get the hang of it.
B00008NRL8|5.0|I watch &#34;Shall We Dance&#34; with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez whenever it's on TV and my favorite part is when they are alone in the studio dancing the Tango to this amazing song which I love. Moving along, we were on vacation in Pismo Beach staying at our favorite place when I heard a song in the lobby that had the same sound I recognized from the movie even though it wasn't the same song. I asked the receptionist if she could find the performers of the song for me and she did since it was a music loop they used in the lobby for our enjoyment.  I was so grateful to her for finding the info for me and immediately ordered it from Amazon.  It is a beautiful CD and I recommend it to everyone.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|It's CCR!! I loved it along time ago and still love it many years later. Truly classics and a great purchase.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|This is a great family movie my daughter loved to watch when she was little. It is a story about a lonely ghost and a lonely girl who befriend eachother.  Heartwarming and funny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome but, it's just like temple run but better! I think  all people should get this app, because it is awesome!!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a classic, Adele is very hot and awesome and how could it possibly get any better than this? I'm sure she'll show us . . .
B007HC3LHS|5.0|All throughout this book I could truly feel the characters.  I could feel the emotions so strongly that it honestly gave me a dark, almost hopeless feeling inside.  There are people in your life that will come to mind as you delve into this story...people who you will see in a different light, wondering what and who they really are.  There are people exactly like what is described in these pages.  The chapters give a new view on what a seemingly flattering love interest can hide - maniacal obsession that can be all but inescapable.
B0047685I2|5.0|Thank you for a great product and fabulous service.  I love this movie and was happy to get it at such a great price.
B0046UGSNS|1.0|This movie was contrived, boring, destitute of anything charming, delightful, or good.  The gratuitous sex was stupid, and the acting was mundane.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is so much fun! One of the best downloads I downloaded in awhile!!! Glad I downloaded it...plus I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the Jurassic Park movies! Great game!
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|The music of this show is wonderful.<br /><br />I originally became obsessed with the music while watching the previews commercials.  They played one song and it took sometime but I found the title \\"Glitter and Gold\\".  This song should definitely make it onto the next volume, although I've already downloaded a version by Rebecca Ferguson from her album \\"Heaven\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book I did not stop reading till the end. Most books start off slow but this one(to me) started off pulling me into it. And the end is a major cliffhanger. I can't wait till the next one! And I can't help but wonder how the 3rd book will start off.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Been using ES File Manager for quite a while - my last three smartphone - and couldn't get along with out it. Great App!!!
159448385X|5.0|One of those &#34;can't put it down&#34; novels.  The reader is drawn into the lives of these women with empathy and compassion.  Life in Afghanistan becomes real.
B002VRNR1Y|3.0|I really have no idea why this mess gets such great buzz year after year. Olive Oil was really a pill, Jack was Jack but the whole thing was just not worth all the effort to stay awake.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved the emotion, drama, witty remarks. Couldn't put it down! Very well written especially in the perspective of Kevin. It's a must read.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|For a few weeks after I loaded Dolphin, I had to use ES File Manager to launch it.All of a sudden, by itself, it appeared in Apps and in the Carousel. Definitely worth the effort to install and use, don't miss the fantastic gestures feature!
1582701709|5.0|This book really helped me in a time of need!  I would recommend it highly, no matter what your situation is.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|App is simple and gets the job done. The things you want most are right there on the first pages well laid out and easy to get to. For those wanting more detail the historical charts are a nice feature as well as the more in-depth status information.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|sub surfers rock! u jump run on trains use jet packs and much more. it is TEMPLE RUN modernerized. u deff need to get it
B006OOHYIC|2.0|Not really my kind of game. Just glad I got it when it was free. I would be very disappointed if I had actually bought it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love the fact that this book focused more on Ethan and his journey into the caster world.  It was so cool to see the turn of events and all of the surprises.
B007TML4EI|3.0|Glad I got it when it was free, or else I would be slightly disappointed if i paid for it. It's a really fun game, just not my type of game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A friend of mine borrowed me season 1 on dvd. After that I was hooked. I never usually watch TV series but this one is more like something you would see on a cable network. Great acting, Great story.
B00B10ENBA|4.0|I saw this before it was awarded the Oscar for best picture and was not surprised.  It's a great movie with interesting characters, suspense, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  And one more thing, no obligatory sex scenes - you know, those nude, steamy, intimate scenes that Hollywood feels obligated to include in every single move these days.  Thankfully, no such scenes appear in ARGO - it's just pure cinema at its best.  A must see!  You will not be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so great im one of those people who dont get into games that much but i still play this and it has updates all the time so its always changing...simple fun.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel was very good in the movie but it is a much darker movie than expected.  Heavy drinking, drug use, and nudity really make it for a slightly depressing flick.
B001GF7WRW|3.0|The AKG K99's are decent. Nothing more, nothing less. They will provide music and not just 'noise'. They're lightweight, but not all that comfortable, and a bit hard to adjust due to poor construction with cheap parts. But once broken in, they're pleasant enough for the casual listener, not audiophiles who truly care (of course they likely wouldn't buy them anyway, and these were only going to be for travel in my case).<br /><br />The odd thing, to me, is that the K77 is better to my ears. Though they 'list' for less they are typically the same street price. They just seem to have more. Nothing too specific, just more. Once broken in they're more pleasing to listen to, as they're less boring. They're lively, well balanced and fairly dynamic. The K99's just seem to drop the ball somehow.<br /><br />In either case, the quality of the parts is piss poor, and the actual build quality is a bit touchy as well. Not that they fall apart in your hands or fall off your head, but just little things ... a crooked something here, a poorly adjusted something there. Enough to notice. The cord is rather annoyingly long on both pairs, and the ear cups feel rather like Dixie cups. Cheap, hard. You practically expect them to make cheap little plastic toy noises when you put them on.<br /><br />So, I'd say just buy the K77's, especially if you're buying from a seller who prices the K99's proportionately higher to match the list price difference. And even if not, just buy the K77's and enhance the odds of wearing a smile under those phones.
0547884591|5.0|I've read through the Kindle version twice and just didn't get the full experience.  I'm a huge TF fan and bought the Kindle edition on release day for $4.99.  I'm not a super huge fan of reading electronic versions but I wanted to read it immediately.  Yesterday I picked up the print edition after hearing people rave about how much better it was than the Kindle version; a very beautiful book indeed with very easy to read typography and nice vibrant photos.  If you watched Tim's presentation on CreativeLive then you already have the one-pager with all the highlights in your mind and while you don't need this book you should grab a few for gifts or to have on your coffee table.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|Glad I purchased this.  Great movie! We have enjoyed it every time we have watched it. Worth every penny paid.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|After reading this book I started to notice the love languages of all of the people in my life. I can see how connecting with people on their level can only enhance my relationship with them. Wish I read this book years ago.<br /><br />It's a very easy read with many stories of unhappy marriages becoming loving again using the principles in the book. The book, itself, didn't seem to be particularly geared toward woman or men, but I did find certain chapters focussed on one or the other. That was slightly off putting to me. Also, the quiz at the end can be pretty sad for those who haven't had love in their relationship in a long time. The questions are phrased as if the spouse has been doing the loving things.<br /><br />If you're not feeling particularly loved in your relationship this book may give you some insight and may help turn your relationship around. Definitely worth a read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app for instant weather updates. Easy to use. I usually watch the weather on my local news channels but tend to miss it. Very useful for days when I do.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Really enjoyed watching...in fact I watched 2 times!  Loved the characters, the actors and the story line.  Looking forward to season 4.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The puzzles are well designed and fun for all ages really because younger kids that just want to race through each level can as any solution puts you on to the next puzzle and the puzzles themselves are not hard to solve or frustrating.  Other folks might like it because you can also try to solve each puzzle in the minimum number of moves which adds some complexity and replay value.  Generally speaking, the puzzles that are more open are harder to solve in the minimum number of moves versus the more closed in puzzles which have a lot of forced moves.  The puzzles aren't arranged by how open they are, but how simple they are to solve in any manner.  So the difficulty of the puzzle might not match the level of the puzzle if you're trying to solve in the minimum number of moves.
1934609625|5.0|This is one of Ms. Allingham's best, I think. It also can be found under the title &#34;Tether's End&#34;. What can bring such a crime story to life is the people in it, and one can just see some of her creations as real human beings. Recommended.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Works great, easy to use, definitely a must have application for the Kindle.  It's a feature the Kindle should already have included with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Our whole family loves this game! It is challenging and fun for all ages. I Love the frequent updates also.
0880796863|5.0|This is one of the classic tarot decks, it's not meant to be more for beginners or advanced readers.<br />It was my first deck and to this day it is almost the only one I use.<br />Tarot de Marseille and Rider Waite tarot (I may be wrong) are sort of considered as THE original and most known<br />tarot decks, so this definitely worth buying.<br />It really well presented when it first gets to you with the nice box and all.<br />If your a beginner and think that you can rely on the guide it comes with well your wrong...it's tiny and is just a nice little additional<br />thing to have. If you need a first good guide, the \\"Learning the Tarot\\" by Joan Bunning is an excellent one.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app was just what I was looking for and quite enjoy it. This app can compete with Instagram I think and can only get better if they added more options.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Make sure you watch the band's comments section....it is fun and enlightening.  Also, there is an error in the people listed as the stars.  Jordan Rudess isn't listed...and some dude named Kent is.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are fabulous. I couldn't put  them down. Now I want to go see the movie. It is an interesting story.
0765325950|5.0|Entertaining though it would have been nice to have less &#34;battle tactics&#34; and more exploration into the wrapping up of the characters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story containing drama, romance, suspense and even some comedy! I Completed it in about three days and definitely recommend to others!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Played it for a while but lost interest pretty quickly, I don't think I had the skills to make it work the way it was supose to.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The movie was excellent, however, streaming had moments where issues occurred. I would definitely recommend the movie! Best Picture Oscar winner also!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|There were no characters, only caricatures.  Also, I am curious as to the instance count for any form of the word &#34;scream&#34; or &#34;red&#34;.  It started to feel like all people did was scream or redden.  I know it's a young adult book, but don't our kids deserve better than shallow, stereotypical characters that must suffer a writer's one-dimensional vocabulary?
B005H29GSI|3.0|It seems fun but it is tough to build.  The pieces like to fall off when you are building it.  It isn't usually played with the way it was intended.
0765325950|5.0|A great read. I could hardly put it down. Thank you to Brandon Sanderson! Its a very brave thing you did picking up a World created by someone else, you did a wonderful job with it. I only wish you could have stretched it out a little more.  Thank you Robert Jordan for planning ahead and allowing your fans to have closure, you were a rare man Sir, and you re missed.<br /><br />To anyone reading this wondering if they should buy and read this book. Don't listen to the haters. While parts of the book might not be what you wanted. The story plays out to a very fine ending.<br />Buy it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Terrible.Waste of money and time. What did I expect? The first one was terrible too. It is a horrible game. Give me my money back.
0142413828|5.0|I read this book to my 3rd grade students a few weeks ago. They loved the book! We followed up by completing a group book report project found on [...].
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|. Simple, yet a fun, addicting game. I find myself playing as soon as my coins reload. A fun game to pass the time without spending your own coins at the arcade.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I usually do not like duets CD's, but this is the exception.  Good songs, great artists.  Very enjoyable.  I am very happy I purchased it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Been playing for a few months now and on level 20.  I enjoy all the different cities you get to travel to!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My boys enjoy this game a lot. Even the 4 yr old thinks it is great! Thanks for the update.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I found this app to be very easy to use and use it mainly on my Kindle Firt but have used it on my phone also.  I like it even better than going to ebay on my laptop.  Could have used some basic instructions when I first started using it and couldn't find any but perhaps I just didn't know where to look.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought during Black Friday, good price nice movie, my kids love this DVD, they watch it repeatedly, everyone like the movie
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Pre-ordered this series back in August and finally received it this week.  We have been watching Season 2 daily, trying to limit ourselves to a disc a day but get so caught up in the story was are almost through them already.  Love the scenery, the costumes, and the wonderful characters.  The series is the books in motion.
B009IEXKXI|1.0|Had a lot of potential, but got lost in textbook like details. Got tedious. No way could I finish reading this book. Was a real letdown.
B008VBYN80|5.0|It is a very good game I love it it is the best game I have ever played I love it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always waiting patiently for the next John Grisham story, and never disappointed. Definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting a good read.
1616550414|5.0|For the ultimate Legend of Zelda fan, this is worth any amount of money, but the price was surprisingly low for this giant book of artwork and information.  I highly recommend this to any fan of any of the LoZ games!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Great series, got it for penny prices. I miss the HD DVD's. I know the blu rays are better but these looked great on my 42 inch tv.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Great album; love Florence's voice & the haunting lyrics. While many tracks have melancholy tones, it is not the kind of music that gets you down - instead it lifts you up!
0525953728|5.0|Liked the book, has some cool pictures and love the first hand experience. Sucks to see how he got in trouble for writing this. Obama took credit for what he did when Obama didnt do anything besides say mission is a go from 3000 miles away.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|The game is simple, addicting, and fun. However, the game tries too hard to get you to spend real money. About 65% of the dragons require red gems to buy and the only efficient way to get enough red gems is to spend ridiculous amounts of real money (up to 100USD). Also, it sucks having to wait 24 hours for things to finish. The only way to speed it up is,  again, buying red gems. Overall it's fun but a bit limited without spending a ton of real money.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|it wont let me install it even thiugh i already bought it saying theres an error. please help! (i have a kindle fire)
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A great story - definitely a must-watch for any film or music fans and anyone interested in seeing an incredible true tale.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Good show to watch. My wife and I watched all the seasons together and we enjoyed the story line. Recommend to everyone.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great thriller. I find it had to believe that I have read every &#34;jack Reacher&#34; novel and still find them fresh and a great read.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I think if I had sat down and read this book my review would have been different.  I think the person who narrated this story was amazing.  The reason I loved this book was Harold himself.  To make a whole novel about an average man not someone rich or famous, just a father, husband and son.  The story seems so simple but as the novel gets in full swing you realize how deep and layered this story really is.  There is not a lot of sex or swearing just an amazing tale that makes you think.  It goes to show you that every life is a story.  I can't wait for more novels by this author.  If you can listen to this on Audio I suggest it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very addictive my granddaughter started me on this and i cant stop playing.  No problems seems yo run fine every time we powerup
0307476464|2.0|I should say upfront that there are NO SPOILERS in this review. This is the first Murakami book I have ever tried to read, and, in hindsight, I do not think it was the best choice. I have since run into a number of amazon reviewers who say they love Murakami but thought this book was uncharacteristically bad. Personally, I was quite disappointed in the book. It is not my intention to dissuade anyone from reading it. At the time I am writing this review the five star reviews outweigh the one star reviews 199 to 89. So, statistically speaking you are apparently more likely to love the book than to hate it. Still, I think if you are new to Murakami, it might be worthwhile starting with one of his other, shorter, books. In the rest of my review I will explain the problems I had with this book and why, after 700+ pages, I finally decided to give up. I did not hate the book. The story was imaginative, and Murakami did a good job setting up some interesting mysteries, but, there were also some real problems with the book, in my opinion; problems that eventually outweighed my desire to keep reading to see how the story was resolved.<br /><br />The main problem I had was with the characters. There were three interconnected problems here. First, Murakami's characters are too \\"rational\\", for lack of a better word. As human beings we all reflect on ourselves to some degree, and through self-reflection we tend to construct our own personal narratives about who we are and what motivates us, etc.. As Freud, and a whole host of psychoanalysts after Freud, have pointed out, however, those conscious narratives, or rationalizations, tend to be very superficial. They do not really get at who we really are. This is not an insight that is unique to Freud. In fact, novelists recognized this fact long before Freud, and good novelists find a way to get below the surface of their characters. Murakami seemed to me to take everything that his characters thought about themselves, and their own personal histories, at face value. He never digs deeply into their psyches, their hidden motivations, etc.. We never hear the unconscious rumbling beneath their speech or in their actions. We are never presented with actions that appear unintelligible. If we were to walk up to someone we had never met and ask \\"So, what are you like?\\" the person would almost certainly be able to give us an answer, but it is probably not going to be a very deep or interesting answer. Murakami never, in my opinion, gets much beyond that with his characters, but that is what novelists are supposed to do. They are supposed to get below the level of conscious rationalization.<br /><br />That problem is connected to the second problem I had with Murakami's characters. Good novelists do not tell you what their characters are like, they show you. Murakami tends to reveal his characters through dialogue; he has one character tell another character about their history, and that is how the reader learns about them. I do not think that is the best method for creating full blooded characters. This is sort of a difficult point to describe so I am going to illustrate it with a comparison. If you (whoever is reading this) have ever read [[ASIN:0393964817 The Sound and the Fury (Norton Critical Editions)]] by William Faulkner, I want you think of the Jason section. Jason is a very interesting and unlikable character. The reader can tell almost immediately that Jason is full of rage and despair and he takes it out on everyone around him. Faulkner never, as far as I can remember, has Jason say to another character \\"I am just so mad that Caddy left, and that I did not get the attention I deserved, I am so full of rage and despair, that I just take it out on everyone around me.\\" Faulkner just SHOWS us all of that, without having Jason SAY any of it. In fact, it is clear that Jason is not even conscious of his own rage and despair, or the causes for his rage and despair. That is why Jason feels like a full blooded and real character. The reader feels like they know more about Jason than is actually revealed on the page. The reader feels like they have actually met Jason and they feel like they have access to Jason's inexhaustible reality. Murakami fails, in my opinion, to do the same thing with his characters. We never learn more about his characters than what they know and, for that reason, they feel superficial and shallow.<br /><br />The third problem is, again, related to the first two. All of Murakami's characters tend to speak in the same voice. I will give another comparison to explain what I mean. I recently read the novel [[ASIN:0547572174 A Scanner Darkly]] by Philip K. Dick. There is a character in that book named Barris. I am not going to describe in detail what he was like, suffice it to say that he was a very interesting character, he had a very distinctive manner of speech. After I read the book, I decided to watch the movie adaptation of the book. I had no idea which actors played which parts, but as soon as Robert Downey, jr. began to speak I knew immediately \\"That is Barris!\\" The reason I knew is because Philip K. Dick succeeded in giving all of his characters a unique voice (especially Barris), so I could tell just from his manner of speech who he was. Murakami's characters, on the other hand, do not seem to me to each have their own unique voice. They all tend to speak in the same voice which, I think, is probably Murakami's own voice. I think this problem is intimately connected to the first two problems. Murakami's characters are too \\"rational\\", and we all tend to speak in the same voice when we are being rational.<br /><br />Another problem I had with the book is that Murakami spends a great deal of time describing mundane details like: what people are wearing, what people are eating, etc.. Now there is nothing necessarily wrong with describing mundane details. One of my favorite passages in all of literature is a passage from Virginia Woolf's [[ASIN:0156907399 To the Lighthouse]] where one of the characters is simply washing dishes listening to the ocean, and listening to the voices of the other characters out on the lawn. Virginia Woolf was a master at capturing the beauty in the mundane. Also, sometimes minor details about what people are wearing can reveal a great deal about their character. Murakami's descriptions of minor details almost always felt like filler to me. I do not feel, for example, like Murakami's descriptions of Tengo cooking dinner really revealed anything interesting about his character, nor did his descriptions succeed in capturing the beauty of the mundane. It felt like he was just trying to fill space. A little of that is, perhaps, excusable, but I think that if you are going to ask readers to read a 1000+ page book, I do not think that such a high percentage of it should be filler.<br /><br />A fourth problem I had is, I just did not feel like Murakami's writing was very interesting. Of course the book was translated, so it is hard to say how much of that is Murakami's fault, and how much the translators fault. I doubt that all the blame, or even most of it, can be attributed to the translation. All I can say is, there were very few times in the book where I felt like Murakami's writing was genuinely beautiful. Most of the time I felt like the writing was just conveying information in a very transparent way. Good writing is supposed to disorganize our ordinary ways of speaking, and use language in new and interesting ways, to make our ordinary language yield \\"strange sounds\\", in the words of Maurice Merleau-Ponty (one of my favorite philosophers). Great writing introduces the reader into a new world, where words are free, to some degree, from their standard, transparent significations. That is what we mean by \\"style\\". I did not feel any of that in Murakami's book.<br /><br />I have one last criticism to make before I bring this overly long review to a close. I felt like many ofMurakami's \\"ideas\\" were superficial. Now, I have to admit, I am a philosophy graduate student, so I tend to like novels that have some philosophical substance. In my opinion, it is impossible to be a really great novelist if you do not have anything interesting to say (about human nature, the meaning of life, etc.). If the \\"ideas\\" behind a book are superficial, I do not think that any degree of skill or technique is going to be able to compensate for that. You need to have something interesting to say. Now, in fairness to Murakami, I have browsed through the positive reviews here, and it is clear to me that some readers are getting some interesting ideas out of this book. For whatever reason, they were passing me by. I was not getting anything of interest out of this book. Perhaps, for whatever reason, I have a blind spot when it comes to Murakami. Perhaps his ideas were just failing to connect with me. We all have blind spots. So I am willing to give Murakami the benefit of the doubt to some degree. But there were clearly places in the book where I felt like Murakami had his characters present really superficial and uninteresting ideas as if they were profound and original.<br /><br />I will just give one example so the reader will know what I mean. On page 550 Murakami has a character develop a theory of religion. Basically the theory, in a nutshell, is \\"People like to believe things that make them feel good, so they invent stories that make them feel good and then treat them as true\\". Now, it does not bother me that Murakami is having his character attack religion. I am not a religious apologist. The problem I have is that this is a really common place and superficial view of religion. Murakami has his character present it, however, as if it were a profound truth. Murakami also has the character over explain it, in my opinion. The idea is simple. Anyone who hears it can grasp it immediately, but Aomame, who we believe to be an intelligent character, seems to show signs that she is having trouble grasping the idea, so the character she is talking with over explains it. I do not know if people reading this have had this kind of experience, but it is always somewhat annoying to me when someone over explains a really simple idea. It feels like they are talking down to you, and I always want to say \\"Yeah, I get it! It is not that complicated!\\" Maybe I am just a jerk, but reading that section of Murakami gave me the same feeling. Also, the theory is almost certainly false. That theory of religion might apply to many modern day believers, but early religion was not at all comforting. Early \\"primitive\\" religion was based on the placation of ghosts and other evil beings. If religion is just a matter of believing what makes us feel good then why would anyone invent and then choose to believe in evil beings that need to be constantly placated and feared? The answer is, early religion was never about \\"belief\\", and the notion that people can consciously choose to \\"believe\\" in God or not is a very modern notion. Gods, and demons, were experienced before they were \\"believed\\". People were possessed by gods before they believed in them (I am not saying that the gods are literally real; I am just critiquing the notion that religion has its origin in a conscious decision to \\"believe\\" or the conscious invention of comforting stories) Anyone interested in that idea should take a look at [[ASIN:039471475X Politics of Experience]] by R.D. Laing. Laing was a psychologist, and the book is primarily about the experiences of psychotics and schizophrenics, as well as the collective insanity of modern society, but Laing makes the valid point that religion was not originally a matter of \\"belief\\". That is a modern notion which, in Laing's view, is based on our modern, alienated forms of experience.<br /><br />Okay, I have gotten somewhat off topic. Whether that character's \\"theory\\" about religion is true or not is neither here nor there. The point is: itis common place. I do not know how other people feel but when I read a book I like to encounter ideas I have never encountered before. If I read a book and it does not change the way I think about the world in some way I feel like I have wasted my time. I do not feel like Murakami changed the way I look at the world in anyway. That is probably the main reason I eventually gave up on the book. But, who knows. Maybe you will feel differently. Chances are you will...Murakami's \\"ideas\\" were superficial.
