0671042858|4.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is an almost completely psychological horror story.  Stephen King takes you deep inside the mind of an eleven year old girl who has become desperately lost in the appalacian mountains.  You will experience her hunger, pain, and thirst.  You become witness to the importance she (and all of us humans) place on the familiar in a strange place.  Gripping fear sets in slowly with an awareness that something is out there in the woods with you.<br />When I read the reviews of this book it was interesting to note the difference between those who loved it and those who hated it. The interesting part was that there seemed to be no middle ground.  I also note that most of the &quot;haters&quot; seemed to be readers who normally like Stephen King's work.  It is sad and predictable that this should be the case.<br />While it is true that this novel doesn't include any of the gore which Stephen King has become known for (which is what I suspect dislikers of this book felt was missing), it is a great story, told incredibly well.  A novel with true craft, by a true craftsman.<br />That being said, I did have one small gripe with this book.  In my opinion, some of the insights of the eleven year old girl were just a little too mature for a child of that age.  I found this to be just a bit distracting.  Normally, this wouldn't bother me too much - but I was a little annoyed at being distracted from an otherwise truly all engrossing story.
B00005NVDF|5.0|A comedy masterpiece with all of the traditional Woody elements:<BR>slapstick gags, supernatural moments, neurotic career-woman heroine, oblivious husband, great locations, classic dialouge.<BR>BUT - why did PARAMOUNT HOME VIDEO not include the 1972 15 minute &quot;Making of Play It Again Sam&quot; featurette and the 1972 promotional radio show on the DVD?. Let's hope PHV will release a special 30th anniverasry edition with these items next year.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Wow.  I guess I expected some negative feedback on this movie.  I mean, it was a big one.   And, you know what they say....you can't please all of the people all of the time.  <br />So much complaining about the love story...why is that?  How can you feel true apathy unless you are invited into a persons life.  You have to know their story.  Otherwise, you are just looking at them like, &quot;What the hell is wrong with you?  It is just a little smoke an fire.&quot;  Now, I might agree that they whole love triangle might not have been necessary.  However, things were different in the 40's. The men then were truly men of honor and courage.  They saw their first priority was to defend their country.   The angry people of the world probably don't care about this, but it is still true.  I wouldn't have bet two cents on the honor and courage of many of the people in this country before Sept 11.  <br />In any case, I can't believe that some of you can write a review so harsh that it loses its meaning.  No one likes to listen to a bitcher.  So, those of us who are sick of all the negativity just scroll right past.  If you are going to argue, please do it a little more effectively.  The movie was good.  It wasn't great, but it was good.  PH was worth going to see on the big screen and worth renting or owning.  The personal stories only brought it a little closer to home and put it in perspective.  I have much more respect now that I ever did from watching the scrathcy black and white footage from history class.  I think the film makers did what they set out to do.  They have honored the men and women who fought and died that fateful December day.  5 stars*****
0618002227|1.0|Tedious.  Plodding.  Boring.  Painful.  One-dimensional characters set in a ludicrously detailed, needlessly complicated environment (and lousy maps to boot).  A classic?  I've read soupcan ingredient lists more interesting, and product warranty cards more expertly written. <br />As if the prose weren't painful enough, it's constantly interrupted by schoolboy poems and pseudo-mystical &quot;songs&quot;.  I found myself skipping paragraphs to avoid (repetitive and) trite sunrises, sunsets, snowstorms, dark passages, warm fireplaces, etc.  Hello?  Can anyone say &quot;editor&quot; please?  <br />I finally picked up The Hobbit and the Fellowship in order to read them before the Fellowship movie comes out.  I will only complete the trilogy because I have never NOT finished a book...although this garbage is putting me to the test.  I just hope they all die soon so I can get back to reading about interesting characters in other books.  <br />Is this really the best of the fantasy genre, as my friends seem to think?  Please tell me there's some unheralded author out there whose prose dances around Tolkien's before I swear to never pick up another fantasy book again.  And to think I played Dungeons and Dragons as a kid.  The only question left:  do I save the $10 and skip the movie?
0385505833|2.0|Let me start by saying I enjoyed the introduction of each of the characters in the story.  But, the story made everyone out to be angry, caniving, or just plain idiots.<br />The idea of skipping Christmas was great, but the ending seemed to be without thought.  As if the deadline from the publisher came around before the ending was thought up.<br />The story had no meaning or moral.  This will definatly not be a holliday read like; A Christmas Carol, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, or A Christmas Box.

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie, is a book filled of beautiful and valuable thoughts, from a person who didn't receive a lot of love in his childhood. However, he was able to give love to others, even when he was dying.<br />I felt very touched after reading this book, in my ESL Class, at New York City Technical College. Morrie taught me how important giving love is, how important keeping in touch is with others, before is too late.<br />I liked Morrie's aphorisms, since we learn of them, especially this: &quot;Forgive yourself! Forgive others!&quot; If we don't know how to forgive ourselves, we can't forgive others. We can'tbe in peace with ourselves.<br />Morrie had an open mind that allowed others to learn of his ideas.<br />Thanks Mitch Albom, for putting Morrie's memories in this book!!!<br />Special thanks also, to my good professor, Elaine Sohn, in New York City Technical College, Brooklyn, NY, because she made more enjoyable reading Tuesdays with Morrie in my ESL class.
6303589162|1.0|.....I thought when I started to watch this that it was actually a spoof. If De Palma had thrown in some intentional humor, it might have been great. Alas, none of the funny parts were intended to be side spliting. What a disaster! Very sad for De Palma and Griffith. What was she thinking. Did you folks that gave this five stars, really think it was that good, or are you just perpetuating the joke? Shame on you!
B000002AGN|5.0|Don't be intimidated by all the talk surrounding the funky time-signatures and synchopation,... this is an album loaded with great melody, inspired instrumental execution, and lots of swing.  <br />One of the most overlooked reasons to buy this album is for Paul Desmond's saxaphone playing.  His tone is full, round, and beautiful.  His playing is flawless.  Yes, the 9/8 beat is funky and interesting and the crossover into 4/4 is as interesting as it is abrupt, but really, the thing to know about this album is that the songs are really great.  They might be hard to tap your toes to, but you'll be humming along to the cd and will find the songs stuck in your head.  Truly a must for even the casual jazz fan.  Worth every penny.
0385484518|4.0|The book was a fontaine of inspiration to me, and made me stop for a while to analyze myself. What I am doing ? About my relation  people , friends, relatives ,parents . Do I use my time properly ? How good I am as a person ? This book is a gentle invitation to reflection.<BR>In our culture we are forced to be competitive from the beginning of our education. We compare. Who is the winner is the goal. We don't like losers. Everyday a new challenge. Nice clothes. New hi-tech etc..But what is after this? <BR>We use our muscles and brain to get rich and successful. We are very generous feeding our ego, vanity, arrogance every single day. We forget that our soul is hungry too, and the only food that the soul digests is love.<BR>I played the cd version of the book in my way home. All of a sudden I began to cry, I went home and I sent an e-mail to my brother after a long time , we didn't talk to each other. He answered me , then I invited him to New York. He lives in California, he is here now, and I am very happy about it. Thanks Morrie, you make my life easier.
B00005NP04|5.0|i am very glad martina decided to release a greatest hits album and the timing could not have been better. i was getting pretty tired of other female country vocalists getting all the attention just because they decided to market themselves with a higher profile (and less clothing). i challenge anyone to listen to this album all the way through and not be convinced that, based on voice, style, and overall ability, martina mcbride can outsing anyone. her voice covers the whole spectrum on this album, from soft ballads like &quot;valentine&quot; to her now trademark belt-em-out hits &quot;independence day&quot;, &quot;broken wing&quot; and &quot;loves the only house&quot;. just listening to  martina hold that last note on &quot;broken wing&quot; sends chills down my spine.
0385505833|4.0|For the legions of fans anxiously awaiting John Grisham's latest thriller, this will probably be pretty unsatisfying.  Me, I'm not a big fan of his thrillers, and am glad to see him branching out more and writing the sorts of books I enjoy reading, with The Painted House, and now this.  Plus, I'm a sucker for Christmas stories.<br />Like most Christmas stories, this isn't groundbreaking literature.  It's as familiar and comfortable as watching a rerun of It's a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street while a yule log blazes away in a stocking-bedecked fireplace, and in the corner of the room you can see the lights twinkling on the Christmas tree.  It's the story of Luther and Nora Krank, who, with their daughter having joined the Peace Corps, decide to avoid their usual Christmas hassles and expenses and take a cruise instead.  Of course, this shocks their neighbors, who are completely bound up in annual Christmas traditions.  Told in an easy, breezy style, this story feels like the novel-length version of something that would appear in the New Yorker, poking fun at the pointlessness of all the surface trappings of Christmas in a slightly condescending but good-natured way.  There are few real surprises in this story, but that isn't the point.  We aren't reading this book for the shocks or the plot twists.  We're reading it to smile as Luthor finds himself under siege by neighborhood carolers.<br />While this story ultimately does nothing more than reinforce traditional Christmas values, Grisham gets points for not having someone stand up and state the obvious.  Indeed, upon first finishing this story, I felt sort of irritated.  I had the impression that Grisham had ended up endorsing the sorts of activities he had initially lampooned.  However, upon further reflection, I saw how he had subtly underlined a more important message: it isn't important what you do or don't do for Christmas, but the reasons why you do it are important.  For sticking to his guns without being too obvious about it, this novel earns four stars as a Christmas story.being too obvious about it, this novel earns four stars as a Christmas story.
B000002HMH|5.0|I am a fan of all Metallica albums, from Kill'em all up to S&amp;M.  All albums are excellent, but if I would have to pick one as the best, it would be Load.  If you don't like this album you're not a Metallica fan.  On the other side even non Metallica fans could love this album.  Still haven't bought it yet?  Hurry to the record store then.
B000056V73|4.0|I am looking forward to the director's cut edition that is coming out soon which is featuring 30 minutes of scenes cut from the theatrical version. I wanted more and I just felt with this version while very good and the actors deserving of the praise and accolades rendered I felt like there were some moments that were cut short. For example, the scene of Penny Lane dancing in the theatre actually lasts about five minutes and much of it was cut from the theatrical release. There are some other scenes as well that were cut and an additional scene from the end. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars. If you are unfamiliar with this film, watch it. It is a feel-good film no doubt, but well-written with expertly drawn characters.
B00005OB0A|2.0|I don't think that this is her best album over the years. <BR>Her best songs I think are Especially For You and songs in the past. <BR>But I still listen to all her albums anyways even the new one since I am fan of hers.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is an outstanding album.  True, it may not reflect the purist jazz tradition but why do we listen to any music?  Enjoyment, of course.  This album delivers more than its expected share of enjoyment.  An artist such as Krall should not be boxed into a single, restricted musical idiom.
0440219078|4.0|I thought that one of the most interesting elements in &quot;The Giver&quot; was the way in which the Giver introduced Jonas to pain. Lowry clearly distinguishes between types and degrees of pain. The first pain that Jonas experiences is the physical pain associated with sunburn. Jonas tells the Giver that he understands pain after feeling his skin burn. The Giver wisely tells Jonas that there are memories he must give Jonas that would be far more painful. Shortly thereafter, Jonas finds the Giver in anguish and asks if he can do anything to help.  The Giver asks Jonas to relieve some of his burden by taking a war memory from the Giver. Jonas lies on the couch and finds himself in the midst of a post-battle scene. Jonas sees and hears a dying man, bloody and thirsty, asking for water. Next he hears the moans of all of the men around him, some crying for death, some for mommy. Jonas could never have imagined such a painful place. The community in which Jonas grew up not only prohibited such pain, it made it utterly impossible for its citizens to comprehend or feel such pain. <br /> Jonas experiences physical pain in the sunburn and later in the novel when he experiences, contrary to the prophecy of an adult earlier in Jonas' life, actual starvation.  He experiences emotional pain in the transmitted memory of war, in the inability to be understood by his friends, and in the betrayal he felt when he learned of the underlying lies that were being used in the community he had grown up in without questioning.<br />I rate this a 4-star book because I believe it is definitely better than average, it contains interesting ideas and concepts, and it deals with important and mature issues in a way that is accessable to a relatively young audience. I would have liked to read about what the effects of his &quot;stirrings&quot; had been. I also would have liked to gain some closure. The book ends in a way that leaves me wanting to hear more about &quot;what happens.&quot; I respect the fact that Lowry leaves me to use my own mind to think about what would have happened and why. I only hope that Jonas didn't end up getting released.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I think people have been a bit hard on Sir McCartney. It's true that Off The Ground (an album that's got some really good gems in it) and several other solo efforts could have been better but his solo career has been a success. Flaming Pie was a great album but this new one is even better and it is his best since Flowers in the Dirt. The tunes on this cd are quite catchy and he has an interesting sound for this album with a pretty good band behind him. This album doesn't sound overproduced. He seems quite alive with this album. I like the edgeness of Lonely Road, the sadness of the lovely From A Lover to A Friend, the pop in Driving Rain, the beautiful I DO, the funk in Tiny Bubble, the somber Magic, breezy Heather, the blue Back in the Sunshine Again, the romantic Your Loving Flame, and Freedom, a simple and effective rally track as good as Lennon's Give Peace A Chance. A very addictive cd. Tell everyone McCartney is back!
B00000K19E|5.0|The brilliance that went into this movie amazes me.  I think I could watch this movie pretty close to a thousand times in a row without being board.  This is not just an action, thriller.  This is deep and brilliant.  <BR>I don't think, the plot ever really had what I would call a twist it was just so unpredictable the obvious seemed invisible; this script is genius. <BR>The action was powerful.  I can't think of any other word that really says what I want.  It was so stunning, so gripping, so real, so powerful...I haven't seen all the actions out there now, but without even really seeing half of them I feel like I could easily say: This is the best action yet in world history.<BR>And the special effects are stunning, and the entire creation of the scenery is again amazing.  Things like colors that were used to portray sadness and happiness.  I can't tell you all of the stuff you really should just watch it for yourself.<BR>And for you message people.  The message behind this movie is simply so incredible.  I think I should say messages.  I won't even go into it now.  I just want to say again.  Buy it!<BR>If there ever was a perfect movie I think this would have to be the one.
B00005Q66T|5.0|I made up my my mind about a week ago and bought this cd.  It was a hard thing to do, too, because I knew other guys might laugh at me and call me names ... like pretty boy or softy, or something like that.  But I bought it, and I'm not ashamed -- for I'm still a man.  <br />I think all the songs are great, especially 'Frozen' and 'Substitute for love.'  The lyrics don't really apply to <BR>me -- like in 'What it feels like for a girl' -- but I just love how her music sounds.  <br />If you're someone who doesn't like Madonna because you think she's trashy, I recommend this cd to you, too.  Because if you enjoy her music -- which I'm sure you will -- why should it matter?
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Being a dyed in the wool, British rock fan, unwavering in my loyalty to the tried and tested likes of Oasis, The Rolling Stones, and other such raucous anthemic supergroups, the somewhat accidental discovery of one Ryan Adams has been a fantastic experience. Gold is not merely an album, it is a unique experience, it is the work of a master storyteller toying with your emotions, while keeping you guessing as to what the next twist in the tale will be.  The opening chapter introduces us to the songwriter with the jumpy adrenaline rush of New York New York, while the epilogue of Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard gives us the icing on the cake; a poignant yet sarcastic homage to that mecca of shattered dreams.  But this is only the beginning and the end, what the listener encounters between these two classic tracks is a collection of songs so wide ranging that it is almost hard to believe they came from the same artist.  From the neil youngesque Ballad Sylvia Plath, to the menacing Enemy Fire, and the standout track of the album, The Rescue Blues, this is a journey that by the end of it, you feel both exhilarated and perplexed at the genius of Ryan Adams.
B00005214X|5.0|I first bought this \\"album\\" in the 70's.  At the time I thought it was great, but that was just about the time that KISS, Aerosmith and others were the rage... I just bought the CD (Japanese Version).  It is even better listening now.  I realize that one of the interesting facets about George, is that while a Beatle, a song by \\"Harrison\\" sounded like... \\"well... a Beatle song\\", and then after the break in 1970, many of his songs sounded like Beatle songs.  I can't help but think that some of these songs would have been major Beatle hits if they had been done by the \\"Beatles\\".  The only thing missing was John, Paul and Ringo playing the music!  None of the others solo efforts can compare to these songs.  McCartney was still great with Wings etc., but lets face it, his songs were strictly commercial.  George continued to write for the love of it, and this reflects in the sincerity and emotion throughout.  I recommend that all of you purchase Extra Texture, another great album that has a still youthful 33 year old George playing great songs like \\"you\\" and a sort of sequel to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" named \\"This Guitar Can't Keep From Crying\\". As a side note, the Import version listed here at Amazon (...) is of a superb quality!  I live here in Japan and have seen both the U.S. and Japanese versions.  The Japanese version is a small bit larger but the better quality is obvios upon viewing.  Simply put the Japanese version manufactured by Toshib EMI is of a finer overall quality (...).  This is also listed on the obie (paper sleeve that hugs the side of the case).  I bought two, one to play and the other to remain sealed!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What can you say? There aren't may films that are as entertaining as this one for kids or for adults.<br />The kids will love the comic like storyline and will recognise the fairytale characters throughout the film, the adults will remember the nursery rhymes of old - Do you know the muffin man? and anjoy the satirical humour - If I dropped one donkey you wouldn't be living!<br />This has to be one of the funniest and best made films of all time,  a future classic.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is another masterpiece from John Williams. All the audio tracks are simply magical and breathtaking. Listening to the album the first time reminded me of another of my all-time-favorite soundtracks, \\"Hook\\", which is also composed by John Williams. Both of them are about fantasy, and both of them are irresistable to me. I play back this \\"Harry Potter\\" soundtrack at least 5 times a day since the middle of November 2001!!<br />There is also a complementary CD-ROM that comes together with the audio CD! Inside the CD-ROM, you can find many international trailers (German, French, Korea, Thailand, etc), posters, game demo, and much more!!<br />That's not the end yet! Besides both the audio CD and CD-ROM discs, you also get a cool Harry Potter poster (featuring Daniel Radcliffe and the white owl)! (...) this is one of the best Christmas presents for Harry Potter fans!!
020530902X|5.0|This little book is great.  If you have no idea how to write well -- like me before I read this book -- it'll teach you how to write.  And even if you're an expert writer or a college professor, you can learn something from it.  All the obvious questions on grammer are covered, but there's tips on style, too.<br />For a high school student, college student, or just anyone, this is a good book to buy.

0694013889|5.0|My daughter had the vhs tape, book and a Prudence doll with her own potty.  This is a wonderful tool for helping children understand the concept.  Also, it seemed that my daughter related to it as well.  She'd read the book and place her prudence doll on the potty as she sat on the potty herself.  Additionally, she LOVED the video.  Especially the end where all of the children sang the potty song.  <br />Great product.
B000008JUM|3.0|some out and out garbage( thompson twins,jungle brothers,neneh cherry,tom waits)<BR> and some truly bizarre interpretations. Most of it is interesting to at least listen to even if it isn't true to the spirit of Cole Porter.<br />Worth it for annie lennox,u2,kd lang and lisa stansfield. in fact, more than worth it. lovely covers by these artists. There are versions here that I cannot get out of my head and this disc is a regular play for me. Although uneven, I highly recommend this disc.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This is one one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen.  Some of the people I know think that live action will always dominate anime, and this goes to show that this is idea is well, wrong!  I loved this movie and watched many times in a row, and I also confess to watching the final battle between Tetsuo and Kaneda many, many times.  This is not a movie that you should miss.<br />If I was weighing the pros and cons of this new version, I would have to say the good is more than the bad.  I can see that many people were upset over the new voices, and I agree with them.  The change in Kaneda's voice almost made me give it a 4 by itself!  Instead, I looked on the bright side.  the animation was re-vamped to become top notch, and the music has been redone to a great degree.  Overall, this is probably the best anime title that has ever been made, and to miss it would be a crime.
B00005QK3W|2.0|Every new album from Paul is worth waiting for. Until they are released. I haven't even been able to fully listen to Driving rain because it doesn't touch me. Apart from track 1,2,3,11 and 12, these song are totally indifferent. They have no inner strength, they have nothing to express (Spinning on an Axis is pure rubbish). Every artists only task in life is to make good music. Do not fill our ears with indifference, Paul. Please. We are your fans.

B00004Y6NV|5.0|The general perception of this album as &quot;failed&quot; in many circles always left me wondering. I can see nothing failed about it, and I feel it is fully as good at the &quot;multiple-platinum&quot; Brothers in Arms. I think it talks to Dire Straits advantage that they did not emidieatly after the huge success of Brothers in Arms shot out 2 or 3 rapid albums to score it big. Instead they waited untill they felt they had something they could vouch for artisticaly, and in the meanwhile doing some sideshows.<BR>The album got a very somber and dark mood to it, though it is unlike the moodynes of the early albums. Where the mood on the first albums seemed a somber optimism. On Every Street seem to contain a pessimist tone(which is also apparant on Brothers in Arms). Important issues get touched here on, Iron Hand(war)and My Parties(pollution and ignorance). But off course on a Dire Straits album there is also time for a broken heart(and a vengeful soul) on How Long. <BR>The style on this Dire Straits last &quot;real&quot; album has changed from Brothers in Arms and Knopflers involvement in Notting Hillbilies cannot be ignored. I see the album as the gold watch at the end of a fine career, and not as a &quot;going out of buisness&quot; sign.
6304401736|3.0|While I thought the animated old version was adorable and funny, this remake is far from that.<br /><br />I bought this video for my daughter when she was 4, and after watching it, she became upset for months about Cruella and scary robbers. This movie gave her her first nightmares, even though we hadn't even finished the film. While we were watching, she started to get tears in her eyes. I asked her if I should shut it off, and she said yes. She saw enough dark gloomy scenes in the castle, evil dialogue from the robbers, and Cruella talking about smashing the puppies heads in and skinning them to traumatize her for quite awhile.<br /><br />I was so angry about this being considered a movie suitable for all ages, that I e-mailed Disney with my angry thoughts. No response. I read a review of one parent saying they watch this repeatedly with a 18 month old and he loves it. Beware, he is responding only to the visual stimuli, not absorbing the plot. An older child between 3 and 8 might find this quite frightening.<br /><br />Disney movies aren't necessarily heartwarming or innocent. Everyone loves a great villain, but when they are played by real people and not cartoons, a young child WILL find them frightening. There's too much violence and cruelty in 101 Dalmatians, and this film should only be for children over 8. By that time, they have a better understanding of reality and fantasy. No matter how bright, (my daughter is gifted), below the age of 8, their emotions are not ready for this film.<br /><br />As much as Cruella is a great character, can't deny that, she's not for the young and impressionable. Know what you are showing your child ahead of time if you have any reservations about possible inappropriate content by previewing alone first. I learned the hard way, but worst of all, my daughter didn't have to if I'd known. Robbers, stealing, killing, assaulting and gloom are not pleasant at any age, but for your child? Consider this carefully, also factor in your childs age and temperament before allowing this \\"Disney Classic\\" onto your roster.fore allowing this \\"Disney Classic\\" onto your roster.
0596000480|5.0|Once again David Flanagan has created the definitive reference text for JavaScript. The most popular scripting language on the Web, JavaScript is nearly ubiquitous now. The fourth edition has been updated all the way from JavaScript 1.2 in the third edition to cover JavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript-262 Version 3), the W3C DOM standard (Levels 1 and 2), while retaining the old legacy &quot;Level 0&quot; DOM for backwards compatibility. <br />Older editions emphasized Netscape over Explorer, as Netscape had more market share. This edition has almost completely purged this emphasis, and instead focused on standards-compliance for cross-browser scripting. With the proliferation of implementations, it is no longer practical for one book to document every quirk and workaround associated with all browsers. Focusing instead on specifications instead of implementations makes this book easier to read with a longer shelf-life, and your scripts more portable and maintainable.<br />With the release of JavaScript 1.5, better browser support, open source JavaScript interpreters (one in C and one in Java), and its availability on a multitude of platforms, JavaScript has become a mature language. This book reflects that. The fourth edition splits the reference section into three parts. Core JavaScript, which should work anywhere. Client-side JavaScript, which deals with browser-specific language material, and the W3C DOM has a section of its own now. The DOM defines a standard API that is distinct from the legacy API of traditional client-side JavaScript. Flanagan has found that depending on the browser platforms they are targeting, developers typically use one API or the other and usually do not need to switch back and forth.<br />The book is huge, some 916 pages long. In order to accommodate all the new material Flanagan omitted reference pages for the trivial properties of objects. Everything is covered in the object reference page, just not twice as before. Flanagan has left out somenon-cross-platform features, like Netscape's nifty .jar ARCHIVE source file attribute, which is not supported by Internet Explorer.<br />While not a JavaScript in 24 hours how-to, this book has plenty of illustrative examples and explanatory text. This combination of explanatory material and matching extensive reference sections make this a must-have book for any JavaScript programmer. Highly recommended.
0385505833|5.0|We've all been fed up with the hustle and bustle of the holiday season at one time or another. This book shows that feeling this way isn't necesarily a bad feeling but it's not what the holidays are all about. The lead character is Luther Krank, a man totally mad that he is going through another boring, debt-filled Christmas. He thinks if he ignores the holiday completely and goes on a cruise instead that it will pass un-noticed. He learns through trials and tribulations that money and crowds and last minute shopping are not at all what Christmas is about. Rather, friendship and family makes our lives worthwhile!! A treasure of a book that i'd highly reccommend to all and I will probably find myself reading every year at this time!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I had heard that the DVD release of the movie would be like a directors cut &quot;R&quot; rated version with extra footage. I was also told that there would be less emphasis on the love story and more on the war and battle scenes.Nothing of the sort is true on my version. Yes the love story is a little long , but a least MS. Beckinsdale is nice to look at.<BR>Also, one major problem with the DVD version are the subtitles. When the parts featuring Japanese language are on. the subtitles are on the movie screen rather than on the black screen below as should be the case. As a result the titles are a little blurred and very small . One must get right up to the screen to read them.I have a 27&quot; screen. Even if you use english subtitles when watching the film, during the Japanese parts this problem still exists. Oh well, still a good movie and love the doolittle raid part !!!!! Very patriotic film too !!!!!!
B000001FTJ|4.0|The 1983 release from Tom Waits, ends the transformation that was first apparant on Heartattack and Vine, the transformation from the hobo-poet and in to the experimental seems to have gained speed. The use of piano is more limited, and the use of percussion and the less traditional instruments. The album is full of Waits, strange and witty lyrics.<BR>The change on this CD compared to Heartattack and Vine is monumental. Let me say it right away even if you loved Heartattack and Vine or Blue Valentines it is NO guarantee that you will even remotely like Swordfishtrombones. I think the change apparant on this release are welcome, to me it sounded like Waits was getting tired of his old style, and he wanted to try something new. I think that the album is like the wind after rain, fresh and clean.
B0000508U6|4.0|After I heard the cut \\"Trouble\\" on the radio, I bought this CD the same day. I was not disappointed. This is definitely thinking music as well as listening music. The opening cut \\"Don't Panic\\" is another track that I also fell in love with. Coldplay reminds me of Al Stewart with his great 70s hits \\"Year Of The Cat\\" and \\"On The Border\\". Those two cuts from almost 30 years ago would fit in on this CD perfectly.<br /><br />Although I listen to a variety of styles, from mostly alternative guitar pop (my favorite) to some R&B, Disco and even Country...this is a unique style that I find appealing in an entirely different way than usual.<br /><br />If you've been flying around looking for a CD to relax and ponder with, and want a fresh new sound...open your \\"Parachutes\\" and land here.
B00005QG9J|1.0|I went back to edit this review and I realized that I haven't listened to this album in a LONG time and it was a waste of money.  I gave most of the songs good ratings but now I deleted all of them because i really can't stand this album anymore.  I liked it when I liked incubus but now they're for teenage girls and not for people who prefer intelligent lyrics and astounding guitar work accompanied by a knock out rhythm section (i.e. Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd).  Nu-metal is dying, so don't buy this album.
0517122707|2.0|Written with style. Toole definitely had talent, but it takes more than vivid descriptions to make a great book. I found the book utterly depressing. It gave me the feeling I get after a David Lynch film, like I need to take a shower. I kept trudging through it because I had heard such good things, but the good things never came. (...) How can so many people love this book so much? I guess the world would be pretty boring if we all agreed on everything.
B000002J1U|5.0|My favourite Zeppelin album  partly because it includes one of my favourite tracks, Since I've Been Loving You, a bluesy number which seems perfectly structured for each member to showcase their talents. Great lyrics and vocals by Plant and the guitar work is Page at his very best.  That's the Way is a beautiful, wistful folky song as is Tangerine. Gallows Pole, a traditional song, gets a power packed workover and Out On the Tiles showcases Bonhams fine drumming.
B000002LKU|4.0|The Notting Hillbillies, was one of the projects Knopfler worked on while he was away from Dire Straits after the release of Brothers in Arms, and on this he admits his heart to the country/blues/roots music. Knopfler always had this in his heart and it gets more apparant on the last Dire Straits album, On Every Street. <BR>Here he is together with Steve Phillips, Guy Fletcher, and Brendan Croker, and together they make up the Notting Hillbillies, and don't let the name cheat you! There is nothing low about these gentlemen, all exeptional musicians and they seem to work together perfectly on this album, starting out with the brilliant Railroad Worksong and ending in the fantastic Feel Like Going Home. This is a fantastic album that should be in any collection, of country/blues. It really served Knopfler well to do this project before returning to Dire Straits for their final album.
B00003CXWU|4.0|I have to admit, I did find this film very entertaining. It does steal it's cinematography, direction, and soundtrack style from 1990s Martin Scorsese classic \\"Goodfellas\\" in a very obvious rip-off though. Let's face it, that's part of what makes it entertaining. What a compliment, over a decade and someone is still trying to capture that magic.<br /><br />There IS some magic herein. The film moves along interestingly, doesn't really have any dull moments, and is easy to follow.  This is a very watchable cast as well.  I personally found this film far more interesting than \\"Traffic\\", which felt slow, and too convoluted.  I will say that Johnny Depp was somewhat annoying to me in his role as main character George Jung. He wasn't a sympathetic character, he just seemed like a moron who managed to accrue a ton of money illegally, only to \\"Blow\\" it.  I didn't care about him or anyone else in the film, due to the one big fault here, poor character development.  Everyone in the movie seems empty, with the exception of Ray Liotta, who did a fine job as George's dad. I disliked Depp's bogus New England accent, it was annoying to listen to his narrations of the events.  This only thing worse?  His moms annoying nasal whine.  I lived in New England at one time, nobody sounded like this!  I also can't fathom why George evolves into such a doofy goofball toward the end, after having been a fairly cool guy at the beginning.<br /><br />The plot develops heat in the form of beautiful Mirtha (Penelope Cruz). She is a hedonistic, self indulgent Columbian coke family princess.  There is some steamy sexual chemistry as the two meet at a wedding of Georges closest  Columbian associate.  George steals Mirtha from a rival who can't fight his good standing with Pablo Escobar, famed (or so they say) lord of the (drug)rings. The two words \\"I Do\\" turn George into more than just a \\"gringo\\" to the cartel.  He becomes part of the family too.  Of course, that's not ALL he becomes as a result of this union.  Watch and see for yourself.<br /><br />Something I found funny, is the not so coincidental casting of Ray Liotta as Georges n'er do well Dad, and the goomah(girlfriend) he kept on the side in \\"Goodfellas\\", playing Georges Dad and Mom respectively.<br /><br />For the most part, watching the rise and fall of Jung from the 60s as a drug dealer who starts with marijuana, then pushes the envelope to a 70s Cocaine empire, is fun. You get an excellent feel of those eras in time, the clothes, hair, music ect. Again though, a similar agenda to \\"Goodfellas.\\" The only difference?  One was the rise and fall of a \\"mobster\\" the other a \\"drug dealer\\" but still, chronicled in similar fashion during the same eras. However, since Henry Hill and associates did traffic and sell cocaine in a major amounts, the only difference is with \\"Blow\\" is, that's the ONLY basis of the story.<br /><br />That said, although one dimensional in its plot, not delving too deeply into who anyone actually is, or really getting any feeling for the characters beneath the facade, surface fluff this colorful, is STILL fun and entertaining. That means, it's definitely worth a look.Watch and see for yourself.

B00005OAA6|4.0|Great Album! &quot;I.O.U.&quot; was written about her husband, David Beckham. &quot;Every Part Of Me&quot; is a sweet song about her son, Brookly Beckham (It's a heart-warming song &amp; it will make you cry!). Best songs: &quot;Not Such An Innocent Girl&quot;, &quot;A Mind Of It's Own&quot;, &quot;Midnight Fantasy&quot;, &quot;I.O.U.&quot;, &quot;Every Part Of Me&quot;. Worst Songs: &quot;I Wish&quot;, &quot;Watcha Talkin'Bout&quot;.
6300270424|4.0|I was pretty impressed when I saw this when it first came out [in a theatre]. While its flaws are more obvious now, it is worth having for any Zep fan. The fantasy sequences are a bit silly at times, Planty's ego is too and some of the performances are a bit dodgy against Zeppelin's best work. But it is worth it just for the 25 minute 'Dazed And Confused', a magic moment in rock history, rambling but not a note out of place. Here and in some other parts, it is a joy to watch the band,Page especially, at work.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Waits 1985 release of Raindogs seems to follow in the same vein as the previous one of Swordfishtrombones, the eccentric sound and the alternative music. This is a very mixed album which very well represents the diversity of Waits talent. Some songs are very alternative, Kurt Weil sounding(Rain Dogs), and some sound like his earlier works (Time and Downtown Train). The album represents Waits 80's production very well, and I would dare to say that there is something for almost every taste on this album.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Depeche Mode hasn't released a batch of songs so worth our while since &quot;Music For the Masses.&quot;  &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is their catchiest and bounciest single since &quot;Behind the Wheel,&quot; while the angelic &quot;Freelove&quot; is among Martin Gore's best compositions.  The Mode continues to prove that grown men CAN make sensitive synth-pop without sounding like wimps.  Highly recommended, and an excellent CD from a 20-year veteran pop act.
B000002UY5|5.0|I've been listening to Blind Melon since 92 and still listen to this album. No Rain is by far the worst song on the cd, but it connected with people.(..) A very underappreciated band. The band is/was incredible,and Shannon Hoonwho deep down is a folk artist. With a simple way of saying things that connect to anyone,that is so powerful. And a CD that last this long in a CD player is worth checking out. Change: a beautiful song anyone can connect to. Time: the incredible things Shannon could do with his voice. Tones of Home: I Wonder,why these songs/cd was overlooked.If you don't like it the 1st time, give it a 2nd chance, it'll grow on you. Trust Me (...)
B0000027RL|5.0|This is a classic Peal Jam album.  My first album from this band, and the one I still listen to many years after it was released.  Buy this album!  It's great!
B00004Y6NX|4.0|With making movies Dire Straits seem to change the tune a bit, getting a little harder and more edgy in their sound. The whole album is marked by this trend, which is very apparant on the (great) track Solid Rock and Hand in Hand. Although the soft balads for which Dire Straits are renowned is also there in form of Romeo &amp; Juliet, and the strange gay-balad Les Boys. The album seem somewhat atypical for the Dire Straits portfolio, and in some way it does not quite &quot;fit&quot; with the rest of their catalogue. It is still a great album though, by any means. Mark Knopfler can still handle a guitar like very few.
B00003CXTG|3.0|You'd figure that a movie like &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; would take its subject matter seriously and with some reverence, but we're dealing with producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, who are notorious for making loud, big-budget, empty-headed action flicks.  Now, I like a popcorn flick as much as the next guy, but &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is as shallow as film making gets.  To be sure, the 40 minute attack is as thrilling as a Six Flags ride, but there's no historical depth, originality, or dramatic thrust.  The film borrows liberally from superior films like &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; and the performances--from actors Affleck, Hartnett, and Gooding, Jr.--are wooden.  Only the lovely Kate Beckinsale radiates some warmth and energy in her performance.  As for the script, I was rolling my eyes every fifteen minutes: the screenplay leaves no stone unturned as it recites every war/romance cliche in the book.  However, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; the DVD is well-presented: the picture is near flawless, and the 5.1 surround remix is the strongest I've heard.  It doesn't surpass &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; but it comes close.  So if you've seen the movie and you know you'll like it, then by all means grab it.  Otherwise, you can find better ways to spend three hours of your time.
B00004TVG7|4.0|This CD's almost worth it just for the first track.<br />I really enjoy this CD. I'm no music expert, but I think some ancient or ethnic music tends to either be monotonous or just plain weird to the Western ear. This is not one of them.  It's at times dark, mysterious, playful, melodic, and overall sets a nice mellow mood. I found it indispensable for my Roman dinner party. My only (small) complaints are that the vocals sometimes seem a little over-the-top (probably much intended to be theatrical) and the volume of the tracks is uneven (some are much softer than others). I enthusiastically recommend this CD - good, reasonably-priced pre-Medieval music is tough for me to find. This is it.
B00005NTNU|3.0|The November 2001 'Collection' release should please Dirty Harry<br />die-hards a great deal.  Look up the individual titles for more detailed comments from me.<br />=-=-=-==-=-=-=-<br />DIRTY HARRY  (1971)  4- Stars<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />A very well made genre film that holds up very well and remains<br />a pretty violent and gritty film.  Directed by Don Siegel and featuring one of Eastwoods finest and most charismatic performances, this is the one that set into stone one of the most enduring formulas for action films. A formula still in use today.<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />Magnum Force (1973)  3 1/2 stars<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />the first Harry sequel is a film for action movie and or Eastwood junkies to appreciate. It softens Dirty Harry's character however and actually makes more political type statements than Dirty Harry does.  It's not a great genre film but it mostly holds up pretty well and is entertaining.<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />THE ENFORCER  (1976)  2 1/2 stars<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />The Enforcer really changed Harry Callahan's character.  On one hand he's a bad-(...) quick with the quips kind of a guy... but he's really quite a softie.  The film turns Harry into a kind of fish out of water dinosaur. When it was made, that variation on the Action film hero wasn't as clich&eacute;'d as it is now, but it still feels forced and insincere. It's watch-able but don't have high expectations for this one.  Lalo Schiffrin didn't do the score for this one unfortunately and he's missed.  This is also John (one year younger brother of Robert) Mitchum's last Harry film (he played Detective<br />'Fatso' DiGeorgio in the first three Harry's).  * * * *<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />SUDDEN IMPACT (1983) 3 1/2 stars<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />This is probably the best Harry sequel, and though it doesn't quite offer as much visceral fun as the other Harry's it's one to catch if you're an Eastwood/Harry fan. This is the only Dirty Harry that Eastwood directed.<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />DEAD POOL (1988)  2 stars<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />Dead Pool undoubtedly looked great on paper for several reasons.  Unfortunately it plays out like<br />A very desperate, tired film with ideas that are more silly than clever.<br /><br />DVD STUFF<br />Nearly all of the films in the Dirty Harry Collection of DVD's are presented in Anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen  The exception would be The Dead Pool (1.85:1).  The original Dirty Harry is not a re-release of the original DVD from a couple of years ago. This time out a sterling print was found and restored and digitally transferred. The original Dirty Harry has never looked better.<br />Most of these 5 Dirty Harry films are presented at their best with colors vibrant, black levels strong and few technical problems present.  Sudden Impact's quality is slightly less and there's a couple of moments where print damage glitches are very noticeable. Minor stuff over-all thankfully.  The Enforcer  and Dead Pool are the two films that are not Dual Layered, but in the case of The Enforcer that doesn't seem to affect the quality at all.  Dead Pool's presentation is a few links down the chain from the others.  It's the newest film but has the most flaws visible.  It's a little less crisp and sharp than even the original Dirty Harry and has more print damage visible than the others.<br /><br />All of the films have been given a complete audio over-haul and the engineers have done a superb job on all the films.  The older films in particular have been improved a great deal with a very well done sound re-design.  I suspect some re-recording of some foley type effects took place because some of the sound effects sound utterly free from distortion which you would expect to crop up in loud sound effects from 30 years ago.  All of the films have a Dolby 5.1. track that has been masterfully presented.  Dialogue is easy to hear, and the sound effects<br />And music effectively use the surround capabilities of all the speakers without over-doing it .<br />DVD EXTRAS:<br />Dirty Harry has by far the most extras of any DVD in this series.  I have reviewed Dirty Harry Separately but a heres a quick run-down of its extras:  * * * *<br />This new Dirty Harry release boasts several features including the all new 30th anniversary Documentary Dirty Harry:The Original. A 29 minute puff piece celebration of all things Harry Callahan that Dirty Harry fans will enjoy.  Not a hint of controversy is mentioned and not a discourage word is uttered.  Those interviewed recently for the documentary include: Clint Eastwood, Andy Robinson,John Milius, Evan Kim, Hal Holbrook, Patty Clarkson and Harry fan: Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Robert Urich (who was in Magnum Force - Dirty Harry 2) hosts the puff piece as he visits the sites of several of the films' original locations. Lots of clips from the Harry films are included.  You also get a separate Interview Gallery which shows slightly longer and sometimes different interview sound bites of all of the above participants.<br />The original promo piece from 1971 is under 7 minutes, called Dirty Harry's Way and is fun to watch containing a few Behind the scenes shots and glimpses of Siegel and company at work making the movie.<br />Magnum Force gets the 8 minute featurette entitled The Hero Cop: Yesterday and Today and was made as part of the promotional campaign for film in 1973.  It has some behind the scene snippets of Ted Post directing Eastwood.  The original trailer is not in very good shape on this one.<br />The Enforcer gets a short featurette used as publicity in 1976 that looks at the celebrity of Eastwood and of Dirty Harry.  A few shots from behind the scenes are included.<br /> Sudden Impact  and Dead Pool  are nearly bare bones with a couple of production notes, memorable lines, list of cast and main crew and their original theatrical trailers included on the DVD.<br />There's nothing of any real substance to any of these extras, but if you're a fan of any of the films you'll enjoy what there is of them.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />If you're big fan of all things Dirty Harry you take the plunge and buy the boxed set of all 5 films. It will really 'make your day' but be careful or they might 'blow your head clean off.\\"<br />Christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

B00003CXXI|3.0|At first, I wasn't sure that I would like this movie because it wasn't like the cartoons I am used to seeing.  The only reason I wanted to see the movie at all was the advertisements on television.<br />I was surprised that the Ogre, Shrek, liked any one at all.  In the beginning, he didn't seem to like himself or his talk-all- the-time donkey friend much less all the characters from every other fairy tail relocated to his swamp. Well, once a loner always a loner.<br />John Lithgow played his character well.  What a shame his character only chose a wife because she was a beautiful princess by day and all the others were spoken for except her. It's a shame someone with a small stature couldn't see past the bridge of his upturned nose.  Didn't he have the nerve to jilt this princess just because she wasn't what he thought she was?  He only wanted her to stay in power. Love?? Ha!<br />Granted, some of the scenes in this movie had me laughing so hard it made me sore, but that didn't happen too often.  That's why I recommend renting this movie before deciding to buy it.  There is definitely no comparison of &quot;Shrek&quot; to other Disney movies like &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Shakira...it was months before either Pies Descalzos or Donde estan los Ladrones ever left my CD player. But with Laundry Service...not what I was expecting. It took so much time for this album to come out, and while I know Shakira was trying to master the English Lang, I wonder why. With &quot;Donde estan los Ladrones&quot; each and every song is completely different, nothing alike. With &quot;Laundry Service&quot; they seem to ride in pairs. The rock infused &quot;Fool&quot; and &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot; are very similiar, as are Whenever, Wherever and Objection...and Rules and Te Dejo Madrid...&quot;Que me quedes tu&quot; seems very much like the after taste of &quot;Sombra De ti&quot; from &quot;Donde estan...&quot; &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot; seems rather lyrically simplistic for her usual poetic genius, and while &quot;The One&quot; is the most unique and thoughtful song on the album, it just really doesn't sound like Shakira to me..and &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;...not really even sure what to say about that one, it just doesn't say much at all to me, almost like some other artist who wants to be Shakira wrote that song, but it just doesn't hit it right on the money &quot;Objection&quot; comes close but the tango sounds are almost cheesy...Whenever/Suerte are very good though, which should be since they are the first single..but I can't imagine what will be the next single, I can't see anything else on the album really hitting it off as much in the English market as Whenever...I just really don't know what to think. It's so different. I know from Pies Descalzos to Dond estan there were alot of musical changes, but they seemed so much for the better. Now it seems like she's turned 80's punk rock with a few songs with latin sounds to reinterate that she IS latin. And what happened to her vocals?? It seems they have detierorated some...listen to the Ojos Asi then to Eyes like Yours, especially in the first few bars...you will see what I mean. I am disappointed...I still listen to the CD very much, and she is still my favorite artist of all time...but now I am just anxiously awaiting her next Spanish album...sigh...probably 2 more years to go...
0553212443|5.0|Yes, yes, I hear you say: why bother reading this old book when you can watch it on TV, in several different versions, during the holidays. Let me tell you, if anything, this is a better read if you've already seen the movie. The sense of bitter cold in London in 1840, and in Scrooge's heart, are all the more real in this slim text. Scrooge's isolation is shown to be something we have all felt at some time in our lives. His joyous redemption will evoke emotions you didn't know you had. Finally, for those of you who may have been tortured with Dicken's in highschool, this is an easy, single evening read.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  It's powerful, action packed, and well...it just rocks.  Great directing by ridley scott (legend, bladerunner, G.I jane, thelma &amp; louise, Alien...), great acting by Russel Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Richard Harris.  Great costumes, AWSOME score by Hans Zimmer, (i have the cd). This movie has everything: action, revenge, gore, romance, great CGI... well worth buying.<BR>   <BR>You might have heard some discouraging remarks such as Gladiator not being historically acurate, but it isn't supposed to be.  It's FICTION... its BASED on history, yes, but so is Braveheart...which is pretty unacurate, and you don't see people chasing down randal wallace with torches... (braveheart is a great movie too though).<BR>   <BR> Now not only is the movie great, but the two-disk DVD is awsome.  over 10 deleted scenes, 2 long featurettes, feature length commentary, great interactive menus, and a great addition to anyones DVD collection.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|What's THIS about?! I bought the stripped version a long time ago when it came out and absolutley loved it. I'm an huge DTS fan, okay....and naturally, loving this movie I HAD to have the bootleg cut...so I bought it this week only to find out the bootleg disc doesnt have a DTS track on it! What (...)is THAT about? The theatrical version does but this one doesnt??? <br />I would have rated it 5 stars but gotta take one off due to technical stupidity. C'mon Crowe, you release a movie the way you wanted it to be seen and then cheap out on us with the audio options? Bad move if you ask me....
0345440757|1.0|This book advocates breastfeeding on the formula feeding model. Many of the techniques it suggests, such as scheduling feeds and single-sided feeding, will kill the milk supply of a new breastfeeding mother. I know of at least one mother who feels that her loss of a sufficient milk supply was a direct result of following the advice in this book.
B000002U8G|4.0|Well when I bought this album, I only heard 1 song, and that was &quot;Fearless&quot; I figured if this song was this good the others would to, and I was right. It starts off with &quot;One of These Days&quot; with bass guitar tricks that can keep you listening into the scary voice says &quot;One of these days I'm going to cut you into little peices.&quot; Then it just takes off with rock from there. Then it goes into &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; I didn't really like this song, because the song just doesn't have enough to it, it doesn't have that Pink Floyd mellow to it, ut just sounds dull. But after &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; comes &quot;Fearless&quot; the one I heard. This is a good low beat song with a good acoustic sound, it also includes an extra song in it &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot;. &quot;Fearless&quot; is basiclly saying that Pink Floyd is ready to conquer anything...or not. After Fearless comes &quot;San Tropez&quot; This song I like. It's got a good guitar, a laid back tune to it and a good jazzy relaxed piano with it, I like this song. Next comes &quot;Seamus&quot; Now, &quot;Seamus&quot; isn't a very good song, its a VERY slow blues song, with a small amount of lyrics and a small amount of time, but once again, it's a laid back song. Then comes the amazing journey &quot;Echoes&quot;. &quot;Echoes&quot; is 23:31 min long, but it's worth the time. Once you listen to it, you can't turn it off, you seem hypnotized by it, its just an orchestral experiment,once it ends, you seem like you've been through a mysterious trip into your mind. And believe me, you'd zone out. The middle part kind of annoys me, it just sounds like they slapped a spooky halloween sound effect on for about 12 minutes then went back into the song. But after those spooky halloween effects, the song gets much more powerful with heavier drums, and a sort of un balanced wave of a guitar which can get you sitting there thinking this song will never end, which is good, because youshould be enjoying it. Over all &quot;Meddle&quot; is an intro to Pink Floyd's work after the Syd Barrett years, &quot;Meddle&quot; brings people to they're attention, and they certainly did.
6305078564|5.0|Watch this series and realize what Bridget Jones was writing about in her diary! Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle, and the entire cast do a magnificent job of bringing the world of Jane Austen to life. I watched this series and ended up reading all of Austen's novels.  She is a brilliant writer, full of wit and insight into the people and practices of her day.  If you find her hard to read, get the movies.  Any way you approach her, she is worth the effort!
0312243022|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book for my intro college english course.  It was a fairly easy read and the mutiple stroy lines were very intresiting.  Howevere I WOULD NOT read this book without reading Mrs. Dalloway first.  I am giving Cunningham only 4 stars, because I liked Mrs. Dalloway better.  Still it was a book worth reading.
B00005QCYC|5.0|The best dinosaurs movies ever made... together on an amazing compilation. These movies are fun and awe inspiring... and easily worth the price. <BR>These movies are six hours of escapism, what more could u want?<BR>(maybe JPIV!)
B00003CXTG|5.0|I love this movie, what could be better, it hyas action, love, and josh harnett in a white tank top but anyways , The action parts of this movie has amazing details and a great picture when it shows pearl harbor the water is crystal clear and the setting is beautiful, when its being bombed the fire and gas and smoke made me feel sick, i swear it seemed as if the people were getting tortured, and the hospital scene, with all the bodies, and the nurses have no idea what to do, the attack scene made me cry. Now for the love triangle, i honestly was on dannys side because hes cuter and more lovable, but ofcourse he hadddddd to die, rafe couldnt die, cuz in the movie he died and came back, by died, i meen everyone thought he had died. I liked the romantic part of the movie better, cuz there was no blood and gore. The most romantic parts of the movie were when evelyn and danny were together, and the saddest when the attack was happening, and when evelyn and danny were apart, and ofcourse the end.this movie has something for everyone, trust me, watch it and youll want to watch again.
B00005LANG|5.0|Bob Marley is not simply the best that Reggae ever produced; as far as I'm concerned he's one of the greatest rock musicians ever. I have trouble when trying to decide who I rank higher in my pantheon: him (and the Wailers) or the Beatles. Obviously, I'd urge people to go out and buy his entire library (at least the original albums, it's amazing how many times his work has been repackaged), but if you don't have any Marley this would be a good place to start. The grooves are deep, the song writing is strong. Marley got some heat in Jamaica over this album because people thought it wasn't political enough. For just that reason it might be an easier way in for American listners. It contains love songs and songs of great spirituality. And it rocks!
6304602901|4.0|This is a classic film.  Not very realistic but the film is about a young delinquent (Steve Guttenberg) who is forced into the police academy to better himself, but finds a bunch of people in the academy who would rather see him fail than succeed.  This is the beginning of series of movies which creates classic characters such as Hightower, Hooks, Tackleberry and Captain Lasard.  Got to have a since over humor to enjoy this film and Mahoney represents the kind of person many people would like to hang out with. This film is enjoyed best when watching with someone who has never seen the film and has a sense of humor.
B00005NZBN|4.0|I liked this album.  I'm not sure what any of it is about, but I liked it.  When I think of Dylan, I think of him as a song writer/story teller:  The Hurricane, Joey, Masters of War, Times They Are a Changing, etc.  I know what those songs are about.  The lyrics are compelling.  Most of the time on this album I can't really make out what Dylan is singing about, or at a minimum I'm not compelled to listen.  But... it still sounds good.  Dylan has become primarily a great roots rock musician, and this album is filled with bluesy, jazzy tunes that are simply fun to listen to.  It's worth buying the version with the bonus CD because then you've also got right there the evidence of what he used to be able to do.
0930289234|4.0|Shortly after this book was released in the 80s, a friend lent it to me, and it was a great read at the time, with its East/West conflict, characters searching to understand others, and themselves. People who were neither completely good, nor completely rotten. All this set in a world in which Richard Nixon was re-elected and the Constitution amended to allow him to continually seek and win re-election. And, the now requisite Armageddon, or near Armageddon. It was groundbreaking. But that was the mid-80s. This is 2001. Most of the themes in this book have been picked up and carried further by others,including the best graphic novel ever done, Ross/Waid's &quot;Kingdom Come.&quot;  This book is a good starting point and really should be used as what historians call a primary source, to get an understanding of the pop culture issues of the 1980s. They're all there, only they're disguised, and not always so well-hidden.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This is the ONLY good &quot;nu-metal&quot; CD. In my opinion, this CD beats &quot;Iowa&quot; by alot. The albums peaks are at &quot;Surfacing&quot;, &quot;Eyeless&quot;, and &quot;(sic)&quot;. But, how can you forget the intro? This is not for people who went out and bought a Slipknot t-shirt because they wear masks. This music is also not for teenie-boppers or preps. If you like this CD, check out Fear Factory- digimortal and Skinlab- disembody:the new flesh.
B000000OSE|3.0|I guess my expectations after Appetite For Destruction were far too high. Although this album contains some really good songs, a lot of it really doesn't do much for me. Right Next Door To Hell and Dust N Bones are good solid rockers and I like November Rain and Coma but more building up would have been nice. The point of an epic song is that it builds up and up. Some songs like You Aint The First simply bore me. Don't get me wrong, I like to find something different and I like quieter stuff as well as full on rock, but it just bores me. The only song I really like is Dust N' Bones and Live and Let Die is OK as well.<br />This has quite a few cool songs but 65% of them aren't worth it. I can't find much that would make me recommend buying this album. 4-5 good songs out of 16 simply doesn't justify buying it.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is the the most intense, gorry, and by far the most insane anime of all thime.  There has never been and probably never will be anything like it ever again.  Why is it so outstanding?  Because it has everything an anime fan could ever want in an anime, except porn but that really doesn't take anything away from Akira.  I guess some people actually care if an anime film has a good script or character developement and all that, but personally if I want that stuff then I watch something besides cartoons.  What I want to see in an anime is blood, gore, intense action, and really insane animatio.  Like tha scenes in Akira when Tetsuo seems to be on a whole lot of cid and watches all his guts fall out.  What else could you ask for?
014028009X|5.0|I laughed out loud!!  I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, they've left out quite a bit in the film.  The book is fantastic, I had borrowed it from a friend and liked it so much that I bought a copy for my bookshelf and a few others for some friends.
0393317552|5.0|I read this book when it came out and saw Diamond on the lecture circuit when he plugged the book.  I thought highly of it at the time.  Seeing it still selling well four years later, I wanted to review it but felt a re-reading was in order.  It was even better this time.<br />Diamond's central rhetorical device is answering New Guinean friend Yali's questions why Europeans have so many more goods than New Guineans do.  The answer is location, location, location:  location with lots of domesticable crops; location with lots of domesticable animals; and location with lots of productive acreage having 'Goldilocks' access to the rest of the world -- strong enough for crop and idea diffusion but weak enough to prevent political unification.  The book is twenty solidly written essays like his 'Discover' magazine articles.  Linguistics, evolutionary biology, history, archaeology, anthropology, epidemiology, agronomy and paleontology are just part of the palette from which Diamond draws for his sweeping portrait of the most recent 13,000 years of human existence.  <br />There is hardly a wrong word written, a false step taken, or an error made in this exciting book, which delights in no small part by raising as many questions as it answers.  Diamond knows a lot about a lot of things, and provides many an aha! moment.  He also asks interesting questions about some things that neither he or anyone else knows about, and those questions are as interesting as any of his answers.  He answers questions like: How did Africa become black?  How did China become Chinese? and Why aren't Australia, New Guinea, and Malaysia Polynesian?  One may not like the answers, but he takes a great shot at them, and I relish his doing so.  He asks why proselytizing religion (Christianity and Islam) were driving forces for conquest among Europeans and West Asians but not Chinese.  He also relates several interesting bits about his extensive field work (as an ornithologist) in New Guinea.  <br />Thebest page of the book is page 87, figure 4.1, &quot;Factors Underlying the Broadest Pattern of History.&quot;  The entire book is spent explaining that diagram, which is itself an answer to What are the proximate, intermediate, and ultimate causes to history's broadest pattern?  I would modify his ultimate factors to be geography (adding carrying capacity to his east/west axis) and, more controversially, co-evolution between humans and large animals (with respect to their availability and behavior).  I am also surprised that he did not cite the island-area effect in species or cultural diversity.  But perhaps that would have been gilding the lily.  There is nothing in the author's framework that precludes a change in where the most goods are today.  He notes carrying capacities and access have changed radically over the last 13,000 years, shifting the balance of power from time to time.  200 years ago, for instance, China had the most goods.  200 years from now it may again.<br />If you like history, evolutionary biology or (like me) both, read this book today!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|simply one of the best films i have seen this year,a new kind of cinema,a fantastic show, with great voices and dances.It touches everybody with is feelings.
6304504012|5.0|Many watched this film to see if its lead actress would fail. Madonna-bashing was a popular sport, especially for her acting performances. There is nothing wrong with her performance here, either as an actress or singer (even though she can be seen breathing when she is supposed to be lying dead in her coffin). The real revelation, though is Jonathan Pryce. We all knew he could act from films like Brazil and Breaking Glass, but here he shows he is also quite a good singer. It's clear that he did all his own songs himself, and some of the charisma he injects into the role of Peron rubs off on his singing performance. This is also true of Madonna, who singing isn't up to Judy Covington's original, but she just seems so right for the role, especially when the excellent period make-up and clothes are added. Jimmy Nail has fun as Magaldi, and Banderas (probably hiding from Madonna after her comments in In Bed With Madonna!) works well as the modified Che, no longer representing Che Guevara but now a metaphor for the Argentinean workers.<br />Parker manages some amazing feats, securing the use of the genuine Casa Rosada to film the balcony scenes, as well as the services of hundreds of Argentineans to play the grieving public. These give the director impressive distance shots to balance his subtle close-ups, reflecting the huge impact that this very personal story made on one country. Parker sticks to the original narrative of the musical without additional dialogue, retaining Rice and Lloyd-Webber's spirit. The sound quality is spectacular, the THX or surround giving us the full dynamic range of the orchestra. The additional song 'You Must Love Me' shows that Rice and Lloyd-Webber haven't lost their touch, and Madonna's idea of transferring 'Another Suitcase In Another Hall' to her character is spot on.
B00005QAPH|5.0|**EDIT 10/4/11: ADDED REVIEW OF 2009 CRITERION BLU-RAY**  The most obvious achievement in 8 1/2, Fellini's mind-boggling piece of self-examination, is its audacious mixture of dreams and reality in order to show the protagonist Guido's whimsical mind state. Dream sequences come and go without warning, depicting Guido's pain, yearning, frustration, guilt that can pop up at any instant. The first time we see Guido's face, it is his mirror image, hinting to us the unreality we are about to face. Some of the dream sequences have a Bunuel-like surrealism. Some of them, however, blend almost seamlessly into scenes of reality, intentionally confounding us. Some are nightmarish, yet some are warm and hopeful. Some are brief flights of fancy, and some are lengthy, elaborate, wild visions that reflect Guido's heightened sense of confusion and anxiety. Although the film is often called the best film ever made about a filmmaker, its theme is universal in that it is a vivid picturization of a person's (and by extension, any person's) mind, which is often haunted by the past, tormented by the present, and apprehensive about the future and the unknown...  The Criterion Blu-ray edition duplicates all the content in the bonus features and booklet of the DVD edition, but offers a high-def picture and lossless uncompressed mono track.  The 1080p video transfer seems to come from the same high-def source that created the DVD edition (which looks very good itself), so you get the inherent advantage of high-def over standard-def, which is 2-3 times higher resolution horizontally and vertically.  The uncompressed audio track is encoded at a bit rate of 1152 kbps, which is 6 times higher than that of the DVD's Dolby Digital mono track.  In short, this is the best the film has ever looked and sounded on home video.  Of course, the better your audio and video equipments (especially screen size), the better your experience.  I viewed mine on a 50\\" screen.  As is usually the case in viewing black-and-white films on Blu-ray, you see more optimal black and white levels than the DVD counterpart.  But be sure to calibrate your screen properly, such as with the \\"color bars\\" screen that comes with all Criterion discs.  Proper calibration is quite important for serious viewing of Blu-rays because of the format's ability to show a lot more subtleties and nuances in the picture than DVDs ever can.  The 52-minute short film \\"Fellini: A Director's Notebook\\" in the Blu-ray's bonus feature section actually has better picture quality than that on the DVD edition.  It still looks severely battered and scratchy, but the colors are much brighter, whereas on the DVD they look very faded.  Criterion has obviously found a different video copy of the film for the Blu-ray, as indicated by the opening logo that does not exist on the DVD.  For my opinions on the quality of the bonus features, please see my original DVD review below.  **BELOW IS MY REVIEW OF THE 2001 CRITERION DVD EDITION, originally posted Dec-05-2001**  The new Criterion DVD of 8 1/2 has a sparkling video transfer. A frame-by-frame cleanup of the picture has been done, so this DVD is significantly better-looking than Criterion's laserdisc version in 1989. There are momentary freeze frames during the opening scene, but since they also appeared on the LD, I assume they are normal. The 1.0 mono audio track is indistinguishable in quality from that on the LD -- it is mostly clean and sharp, although loud sound shows some distortion. The image is anamorphic. The disc is region-free. The audio is supported by newly-translated optional English subtitles.  There is one slight discrepancy between the LD and the DVD. The LD contained the American release version of the film in which some scenes, such as the one in which Guido first meets his wife, had altered music cues. The DVD, however, is the original Italian version, retaining all of its original music.  The DVD's audio commentary comprises of scene-specific comments (whose authorship is unclear), and additional comments from critic Gideon Bachmann and NYU professor Antonio Monda. The result is a pretty well-rounded audio essay covering the film's conception, production details, themes, and artistic significance, as well as personal recollections, anecdotes, and abandoned concepts and scenes. Other extras include two 1-hour films on the filmmakers. The first is \\"Fellini: A Director's Notebook\\", directed by and starring Fellini himself. It is a sort of Fellini-style DAY FOR NIGHT, a fictional, somewhat humorous account of how the director goes about making a film. The video/audio quality of this piece is poor, and there are no subtitles or closed captioning. The second film is a documentary made by German filmmakers in 1993 titled \\"Nino Rota: Between Cinema and Concert\\". It offers an intimate yet enigmatic portrayal of Nino Rota through his personal recordings, film footage of him working with Fellini, clips of some early films scored by Rota, and interviews of his associates and students. One segment is about how Rota recycled his score from the 1957 film FORTUNELLA to create the theme for THE GODFATHER, an act that would cost him the Oscar nomination. The DVD extras also include 3 new interviews. Sandra Milo speaks candidly about her experiences, both personal and professional, with Fellini. Linda Wertmuller lavishes praises on Fellini's genius while offering a fascinating appraisal of Fellini's psychology that figures prominently in 8 1/2. And Vittorio Storaro pays tributes to the achievements of 8 1/2's cinematographer, Gianni di Venanzo. Rounding out the extras are 100 or so still photos from the set of the film, some of which were taken from deleted scenes.
B00000IO4I|4.0|It's nice to see Caine cast against type. Here he is neither the hero, nor does he retain any trace of his usual London glamour. He is a morally bankrupt promoter, working with strippers in the clubs of Northern England until he finds some decent acts. One such act is Jane Horrocks's Little Voice, a quiet girl who comes to life only when she is singing. The actress's talent and extensive training leave you with the impression that she is a singer who just happens to act rather than the other way round. If Brenda Blethyn's part wasn't offered to Julie Walters first, I will eat my hat! She is stereotyped ageing northern tart, played with great pathos as well as comedy by Blethyn. Jim Broadbent is suitably seedy as club owner Mr Boo, while Ewan McGregor has a surprisingly small role as a telephone technician who has only peripheral involvement with Little Voice until the last scene. The script is full of good characterisation and wry social comment. I liked it because it tells an original story in an entertaining way. Special praise must go to the set designer, who re-created the record shop/house perfectly, even down to the dangerous wiring job. This film deservedly won many awards and I hope to see more from writer/director Mark Herman in future.
B00005QATY|4.0|While not normally one with extremely eclectic taste in movies, I must admit this film hit a spot with me. A retelling of Homer's Odyssey through the eyes of an escaped convict during the Great Depression. How wonderful.<BR>The basic story, for those who have never read Homer's classic work, deals with a man name Ulysses (Odyseus was his Greek name), who is forced to wander rather than return straight home. Along the way, he meets a Cyclops (John Goodman is perfect in this role) and sirens (wonderful scene). At home, his wife has been set up to wed someone whose ethics are less than sterling. And, it is all here, only a lot more humorous.<BR>In many circles, the soundtrack (wonderful bluegrass) has gained more attention than the movie. While the album is excellent, the movie also has its sterling moments.<BR>Now, this may just be a guy thing, as my wife, who had never read Homer's Odyssey (not sure how that happened) thought the movie was just plain wierd.<BR>I would love to give this film 5 stars, and probably should, but I am sure part of my adoration comes from the fact that Hollywood has churned out so much garbage lately that this film shines that much brighter in my book.
B000002ADT|5.0|'A Kind Of Blue' is the ultimate late night/early morning album.  Against a backdrop of swishing drums and mirror-smooth piano, three legends - Miles Davis on trumpet, John Coltrane on tenor sax, Cannonball Adderley on alto - sing an album of the blues, those of the sky rather than the soul.  The only tension is in the opening uncertainty between Paul Chambers' bass and Bill Evans' piano: thereafter, long, soothing lines lull the listener - even the more energised numbers like 'Freddie Freeloader' and 'All Blues' rarely become urgent.<br />It is probably a good thing 'Blue' IS a night album - the critical faculties are less alert.  Like a vampire, it doesn't take kindly to daylight.  The difference between its easy listening and muzak is not always apparent; it sometimes feels like the soundtrack to a Gerry Marshall movie or the ad for a classy liqueur.  The last Miles album I listened to was the equally nocturnal 'Porgy and Bess', but the latter's jagged atmosphere was one of breakdown and nightmare, not consolation.  Even 'Flamenco Sketches', with only the faintest Iberian tincture, barely hints at the radical fracture of 'Sketches of Spain'.  Best treated as a long, lovely lullaby.
B000002A33|5.0|Virtually everyone who's written a review has said the same thing, so no point going off on one about how good this album is.<BR>Its probably my favourite record ever, one that I have listened to regularly since I bought it all those years ago, it just doesn't date or become dull.<BR>Basically, if you haven't figured it out yet, this is an absolute masterpiece of epic proportions, melodic, heavy, beautiful, the sound of rock and roll in heaven.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I believe that the individuals that gave this movie a high rating only wants us to think that they knew what (...) was going on. No one is THAT intellegent. I think that movie started from the end and continued in reverse was because the writer and directer didn't have an ending for this puzzle. It was just a distration from the typical movie about a wife who really committed suicide and the husband went nuts...
B00003CXTG|1.0|There isn't much to say.  The movie was cheezy and I liked it better when it was called &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot;

B00005JKHP|3.0|First let me state that I love Star Trek, particularly the original series.  And I really liked most of the other movies...even III and V had their moments (okay, I'm pushing it with V, but II and IV were great, and VI was pretty darn good).  That being said, I have to say my reaction to this movie is much the same as when I saw it in 1979 - dull, dull, dull.  It has a few interesting ideas, and is very pretty visually.  But there is simply too much time spent with the characters looking in awe at the V'ger cloud, and very little of what made Star Trek popular among its fans. The &quot;Director's Cut&quot; is generally better than the original and 1983 (T.V. version) release, but there is only so much that re-editing can do.  There are many promising elements - its a shame that the series Star Trek Phase II was cancelled in lieu of this movie.  I think the series could have been much better.  That being said, I still highly recommend this DVD for Trek fans - mostly for Okuda's text commentary.  I found that very interesting throughout, even though the movie itself is worse than Voyger the T.V. series.

006092988X|5.0|I never read this book as a child (I missed out).  I'll tell you right now that it is NEVER too late to read this book.  It's a 'slice of life'.  It's real-life with real lives that render characters that shine.  It reminds us of the struggles we all go through in life.  It's a beautiful story that revolves around the life of Francie and her family.  It's no wonder that so many have told me how wonderful this book is to read.  I underlined scores of lines that made me want to go back to re-read them...to be reminded of how to live my life or how to advise other people.  This book would make a special gift for any one.

B00003CXTG|1.0|Boy falls in love with girl.  Boy dies.  Boy's friend falls in love with girl.  Surprise! - boy not really dead.  Boy mad at friend for falling in love with girl.  Japan attacks America.  Boy reunites with friend so they can save the world.  The End.<br />This whole movie reminded me of that classic B-movie line from 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' - &quot;The message couldn't get through because of the weather conditions in outer space!&quot;  Just a complete ignorance of the subject they're talking about.  But whereas 'Plan 9' can be funny and charming due to how bad it is, 'Pearl Harbor' thinks itself to be of a higher caliber and turns out being only insulting, vapid and very poorly written.<br />I won't comment on the factual innacuracies and two dimensional portrayal of Japan, since many reviewers have done so already.  I don't know if there is a line between patriotism and ethnocentricity, but if there is, Pearl Harbor definately crosses it.  But we can't really blame the writers for being so painfully ignorant, since they never claimed to be making a documentary.  The problem with Pearl Harbor is that it's 30 minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor surrounded by 2 and a half hours of soap opera.  Good writing is when even if one scene is removed, the whole story would be disrupted.  This movie could have easily been 90 minutes and still have gotten from point A to point B.  Everything is so predictable and cliche-ridden that not once did I forget I was watching actors moving around on sets.  Even the highlight of the movie, the attack, is far too long.  The writers seemed to realize that the story they had built around it was thin and plodding along so they figured that if they blow up as many things as possible, it would make up for it.  But, as Hemingway reminded us, &quot;Never mistake motion for action.&quot;<br />But the most disgusting part of this movie is its recent marketing campaign that exploits our sudden surge in &quot;american pride&quot;.  The commercials lead you to believe that seeing this movie is just as &quot;patriotic&quot; as donating blood.  I can only imagine the joy of everyone involved with the project when the WTC was attacked and the media flocked in calling it &quot;the next Pearl Harbor&quot;.  Maybe our oh-so-wonderful nation will be blessed with a sequel on 9/11/2002.  We can only hope.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I have to admit that I bought this album the first day it came out. I have her other 2 albums, but this on is by far the best. I only skip like 1 song when I listen to it unlike her previous stuff. Here's a rating of the tracks and reviews.<br />****I'M A SLAVE 4 U- A very sexy, different Britney song. Hot beats and sexy vocals<br />*****OVERPROTECTED- A classic britney song. It reminds me of stronger since it is a song about being independent. it really makes you want to dance.<br />****LONELY- REAALLY good guitar. More of an RnB song.<br />****NOT A GIRL...- This is Britney's best ballad. She holds a note for more than 3 seconds and it has a catchy chorus.<br />*****BOYS- OMG, this is one of the best songs on the album. Very sexy and catchy, and it has an awesome bass. Sound similar to slave.<br />**ANTICIPATING- Very unoriginal. Sounds like ALL 4 YOU. The worst song on the album.<br />***1/2 I LOVE ROCK N ROLL- Not as good as her cover of Satisfaction, but it works.<br />****CINDERELLA- Very catchy. Especially the talking part in the middle. Cool effects<br />***1/2 LET ME BE- More RnB. A little too short, but her voice is very deep and sexy<br />*****BOMBASTIC LOVE- Awesome, the most catchy out of all the songs. The lyrics are a little funny, but get over it and it's a cool song.<br />***THAT&quot;S WHERE YOU TAKE ME- Electro-britney. This one's ok. It almost sounds like a Christmas song.<br />****WHAT IT&quot;S LIKE TO BE ME- The album closer feat. Justin Timberlake works for me. Lots of sound and beaboxing close the album nicely.
B000002UTT|4.0|that's what the world said back in 1988 when this album was released. When I first heard &quot;The Look&quot; I knew I had to have it. The album has aged a little and some songs sound very dated indeed (eg Never Be The Same (which is updated and live on &quot;Tourism&quot; and much better) but there is still something very special about this album.<br />Among my personal favourites are &quot;The Look&quot;, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Half A Woman, Half a Shadow&quot; and &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;.<br />The album cover is very good - in a mock up of a newspaper and provides the listener with some interesting reading while the music is blaring from the speakers......<br />&quot;Look Sharp&quot; is not Roxette's best album ...that's &quot;Crash Boom Bang&quot; but it gets close.<br />Actually it's such a pity their recent releases &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; and &quot;Room Service&quot; haven't been popular but if you like those you'll certainly like this album and vice versa....<br />so now what are you waiting for..click on the shopping cart
0385505833|5.0|What's in a name? The answer is --- money! As the three most important ingredients in selling real estate are: location, and location, and location, the three most important ingredients in selling books have become: name, and name, and name. And this book has all three of those ingredients. John Grisham, and Doubleday Publishing, and --- the great title, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;. This is the second book I have read recently that reminds me of &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;. The first one, which by the way I also highly reommend when you finish &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, is &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. Meanwhile, Grisham wrote this one shallow enough and transparent enough so you can fly through reading it. Yet, I found it enjoyable and refreshing. It's a Christmas treat that has those other three famous ingredients for selling, well, anything: timing, and timing, and timing. Read this book now. You'll appreciate Christmas more than ever. A merry Christmas to everyone!
0060934913|4.0|Anthony Bourdain is a good writer.  And he writes like he talks (you'll hear him on National Public Radio from time to time) and you can imagine him reading the book out loud to you as you read it in his East Coast staccato.<br />Reading this book is not for sissies.  It can be rough at times, and he unfurls his abuse at us from time to time.  Under the bravado, however, is a sense that Bourdain is actually mightily insecure in some ways.  His profession of his love of his mother-in-law's imperfect cooking, though probably mostly genuine, smacks of kissing up, for instance.  And he claims to love the bawdy, sweltering, testosterone-laden atmosphere of the line, but then he turns right around and admits at one point to lapping up the swank digs of the pastry chef, having a light lunch and an espresso with quiet conversation.<br />That's what I think makes this book work--at least in part--the contradictions.  Bourdain thrives on contradictions, it seems.  That's probably how he can actually love the hellish, rough, interactive life of a cook/chef, and be able to go home, sit down and write a good book in solitude, too.<br />To contrast the way Bourdain writes about his life--the honest but sensationalist way that he does it--and the way someone else has written about him, see Making of a Chef by Dawn Davis.  She writes about Bourdain in a way that does not give you a very good idea about the intensity with which he goes about his business, for instance.  If you want to know about Anthony Bourdain, and his view of the high-end culinary world, go to the source and read this book.
0788816454|1.0|This film is a real stinker. No picture could be as bad as this horrid movie. Adam Sandler stars as a jibbering [simpleton](again?!)who has a job as waterboy for the local football team. He gets angry and delivers a bone crunching tag on a player which gets him a place on the football team. Now, don't get me wrong. I like Adam Sandler. I really do. But, this is just too awful. The funny voices he always does get old in the first 2 minutes. A whole movie of it is unbearable!. It's also sad to see a great actress like Kathy Bates in this. What was she thinking?. Same with Henry Winkler. Fonz, this isn't cool!. Fairuza Balk, as the love interest, is shrill and unappealing. So is this whole movie. A waste of money, time, and talent. Folks, it doesn't get any more sickening than The Waterboy. If you like Sandler, I recommend \\"The Wedding Singer\\", \\"Big Daddy\\", and \\"Happy Gilmore\\". Not that those are classics, but they are fifty times better.
B000002B9I|5.0|Abriendo Puertas is the second of Gloria's three Spanish CDs, but the last I became familiar with. At first I was disappointed as it seemed less &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;cutting edge&quot; than Mi Tierra or Alma Caribena, but increased familiarity has revealed its considerable charms.<br />This is a holiday (Christmas and New Years) related album, but not really a Christmas album as such. All the songs are based on Latin dance rhythms and represent the kind of high spirited festival music that is popular at that time of year. This is as much composer/arranger/instrumentalist Kike Santander's album  as Gloria's-- he has written 10 relentlessly upbeat, wonderfully arranged songs, inventive and  polished to perfection. The details of the songs are quite wonderful, and Gloria's singing is ideal for this idiom.<br />This is really a great album to put you in a good mood, as well as for appreciating top of the line musicanship. The Gold Star award for the songs must go to &quot;Felicidad&quot;, which is just that, and the impossibly infectious &quot;Tres Deseos&quot;, (try and play it just once!).<br />All together, Gloria Estefan's 3 Spanish CD's are a real achievement, and prove that her real talent is in her Latin heritage, and not in the rather ordinary English language albums she is more famous for.

B00005214X|5.0|I remember when this album first came out on vinyl. I got my copy for Christmas. This was not just another album. This was something special. It was a serious cohesive collection of work that surprised many people. George was always my favorite Beatle and it will always be that way. I was more happy than surprised. This album was only proof of what many of us already knew about George. But what was more important was that George had it his way. \\"Beware of Darkness\\" was always my favorite cut. As for \\"My Sweet Lord\\" that's still George's song in my book. Goodspeed.
B00004THAY|5.0|i bought this album for my boyfriend for his birthday, and wound up having to buy another copy for myself!  neither of us were blues fans, but we had heard that this album was a rare find and a good introduction to the blues. it caught our attention and we werent disappointed.  not very many cd's today can boast having an album of good songs-- but all of these ones are exceptional. no searching for the remote to hear the next song-- when the album ends you will find yourself disappointed that there wasnt more.  <BR>i dont know that much about the blues, but i will say that all of these songs have a bit more of a pulse to them then other blues songs seem to, and are just long enough; you will never say &quot;god is this song over yet?&quot;  both guitarists bring out the best qualities in each other, and their voices blend extraordinarily well. overall, i would give this album to anyone who is open to new forms of music, or is just looking for a change of pace.  it has been a great introduction to the blues, and i just cant say enough about it.
0440234743|4.0|A Review by Jimmy<BR>Have you ever imagined owning eleven billion dollars? It would probable be pretty nice. That's not the case for Troy Phelan. Troy Phelan \\"the tenth richest man in America\\" owns eleven billion dollars. Troy Phelan is a cruel hard old man who is on the verge of death. As he puts it, \\"Down to the last day, even the last hour now. I'm an old man, lonely and unloved, sick and hurting and tired of living\\". Troy Phelans 6, rude and greedy children, and his 3 ex-wives who have tried so hard to (...) money from their father over the years are now gathered one last time with their father for the final will signing. Each greedy hair has always thought that they will inherit some of their father's estate but their father had other plans.      <br />The hero of this story is a guy by the name of Nate O'Riley. Nate is a troubled young lawyer with a bad past. He has been battling his drug and alcohol addiction, hiding from the IRS and running from his marriage. Nate, just fresh out of rehab, has been asked by his boss and also friend Josh Stanford, to do one last case. Josh, who was Troy Phelans lawyer, and is now handling the Phelan estate, has asked Nate to find the legal inheritor of the will. Nate is being sent to the Pantanal to battle the heat, water, savages and to find the richest woman in the world.           <br />John Grisham a well known author of all types of books. His books have lots of action, adventure and reality about life. I personally think that \\"The Testament\\" was one of the best or the best book John Grisham has ever wrote. Rating this book in would give it 4 stars. If you're looking for an all around good book it has to be \\"The Testament\\".
0805062971|5.0|This was the best novel I've read all year.  It wass shocking, cryptic, different, and most importantly, thought provoking.  I haven't seen the movie, but if it is half as good as the book, I'm sure it will be worth it.  The book was ambiguous at parts, and sometimes confusing, but it all came together at the end of the story, and everything added up.  I would reccommend this book to anyone.

0380002930|4.0|At first the only reason I chose Watership Down was because I needed a good long book and I had started reading in about the 7th grade and never finished it because I couldn't really get into it.  I actually enjoyed this novel. I read about 50-75 pages in 7th grade and started reading it a couple of days ago and couldn't put it down.  It didn't appeal to me at first because the fact that bunnies were talking and doing human things sort of bored me. I don't know if I liked that at the beginning humans were the enemy.  The whole concept of it was very strange like rabbits talking in their own little language. It was very out of the ordinary because most books you read are concerning other human characters that you can relate to but you don't realize that you can relate to these rabbits. They had hardships just like you and I .  When I was reading this it seemed like this novel wasn't just about cute little bunnies but it had a deeper topic.  The outside of the novel was simply about bunnies but I think the whole theme was about survival and the dangers that wild animals have to deal with.  The novel starts out with two characters Fiver who can see into the future and Hazel who is one of Fivers friends .  One day Fiver has a feeling that something bad is going to happen to his home, Sandleford Warren. When Fiver and Hazel decide to tell their leader, he doesn't believe them.  The two rabbits decide they must take matters into their own hands and leave and a few other rabbits go with them, Bigwig, Dandelion, Pipkin, Hawkbit, Blackberry, Buckthorn, Speedwell, Acorn, and Silver. They begin a long journey in search to find a new home. While on there journey that somwthing in fact did happen to their home.  It was completely demolished to make way for a building development. Along their journey they encounter many animals such as cats, dogs,birds, other rabbits and even humans.  Overall I really did enjoy this novel.  I didn't think I would like it because I thought the plot was stupid but in fact it is not and we could all relate easily to this novel.  I would suggest everyone read this book.

B000002UAX|5.0|I have owned this album for years, both on vinyl and cd and I have always heard the &quot;it should have been a single album&quot; argument. After listening to it millions of times, it still remains my favorite album of all time. The White Album contains nearly every genre of music known to man, and then some! So, to quote Sir Paul, &quot;it's great, it sold, it's the bloody Beatles White Album. Shut up.&quot;

B00005Q45W|5.0|Leonard Cohen just keeps getting better. The first time I listened to &quot;Ten New Songs&quot; I was pleased but not overwhelmed; now that I'm on my 50th listen I think it's my favorite Cohen album to date (although &quot;The Future&quot; and &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; are pretty hard to beat). I only hope Mr. Cohen doesn't keep us waiting another nine years for more of his illuminated, magical songs. I can't imagine a serious CD collection without this album.
6304297912|5.0|&quot;I chose not to choose life; I chose something else&quot; proclaims Mark Renton, one of the main characters of Trainspotting in the beginning.  The film goes on to prove his point, showing Renton's dreary life with friends, living in a flat more resembling a dingy squat, shooting heroin, going day to day wondering where the next high will come from.  Renton, acted outstandinly by Ewan McGregor, decides to kick his junk habit with marginal success, as he is surrounded by addicted friends and endless boredom and limitations.<BR>Trainspotting offers a funny and candid look at heroin addiction without the usual glamorization; there are many gritty and disturbing scenes, such as the dead baby hallucinations when Renton is enduring withdrawal, a scene acted with sublime talent, as well as the hilarious opium suppository one.  <BR>This isn't a movie for the faint of heart of stomach and it may take a few viewings to understand their accents, but is a very entertaining and well acted and directed achievment and one of my favourite videos.
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham has broken his mold in this amusing tale of holiday stress. Luther &amp; Nora Krank decide to skip Christmas this year.  When Luther crunches numbers and realizes how much money the holiday season costs him, they decide to forgo their traditional holiday rituals and opt for a Caribbean Cruise. How this affects Luther &amp; Nora, their friends &amp; co-workers and particularly their neighborhood provides some light hearted laughs.  Filled with little stereotypes of nosy neighbors, how out of control the holidays can get and some of the craziness we will all go to in the spirit of the season, Grisham delivers a unique and entertaining story. Skipping Christmas is a light, fun read that will gear you up for some Christmas cheer.
B00005O5CM|3.0|It's a cute movie, don't get me wrong and it's great for pre-teens. But the movie depicts the general blonde stereotypes. The blonde is materialistic and very simple minded. The guy she's seeing doesn't want to see her anymore because she's not serious. To win him back, she applies for an upscale school to study to become an attorney. And eventually gets in the school with mostly her looks but also common sense...logic.<br />Blondes are stereotyped as dumb but if you think about it they are very logical in their judgments. And in the end Witherspoon's character uses logic to win her case!!<br />Nice one to rent but, in my opinion, unless you're young...it's not one for keeps.

0440219078|5.0|This book is about a seemingly utopian society.  It is written about the future.  In the community that Jonas lives in, no one experiences things like pain, urges, color, and weather.  The community has very specific rules and even decides who a person will marry and what job they will have.  Jonas grows up in a normal family with a mom, dad, and younger sister.  He is different from the other children his age and is given the assignment of &quot;Receiver of Memory&quot;.  After receiving memories, Jonas finally begins to understand what people in his community were really missing.<BR>Lowis Lowry uses this book to show the readers that in order to understand how wonderful things are, they must experience the not so wonderful side of things.  Jonas had to learn this the hard way by being the only one who received the memories.  Jonas begins to realize that there are other places out there beyond his community.  Jonas has to decide what to do with the memories he receives.  Should he stay or leave his community?  Read the book to find out what Jonas does?<BR>This book is motivating to children and easy to read.  Some of the concepts are almost unimaginable compared to our lives, but the author uses vivid word descriptions to help the reader understand.  It also teaches that children can make a difference in this world.  Most importantly it teaches that people have to experience the bad to appreciate the good.  People must be able to reflect on their past and their memories in order to move forward in the world.

B00005214X|5.0|Whether or not this is the best Beatles solo effort is irrelevant.  The fact is, you can't really compare them.  They are all pop records, but, very different in presentation.  George has presented a somber, melodic, spiritual side of pop that had not been seen before.  The haunting vocals are astounding and would be unmatched throughout the rest of his career.  However, the extra tracks are a bit unnecessary.  &quot;I Live for You&quot; is a beautiful song which I can't understand why it wasn't included originally.  But, the instrumental &quot;What is Life&quot; and the awful &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot;  have no place in the album.  Also, the instrumental jams towards the end do get tedious.  But, considering that's the only complaint I have, I highly recommend this album.  Trust me, you'll get hours of enjoyment from it.

0767821629|5.0|This movie blew me away and left me asking more questions like &quot;How do you know 2024 isn't another simulation?&quot;, &quot;Were these simulated worlds used to rehabilitate criminals in the future?&quot;, &quot;Were the inhabits of the future playing most all of the roles in the simulated worlds and that is why they claimed to be real and hated characters that would mess up their world?&quot;.<BR>I need a second viewing definitely.  My wife thought the movie was OK (3 stars) and had a simple answer for the ending.  I was about two seconds ahead of the 90's character when he decided to drive off into the desert.  I was thinking he should do the same thing at that point and said that to my wife before he did that.  Awesome movie I will recommend to everyone, did not expect it to be this great.  I will probably buy the DVD.  It does lack in extra features.

B00003CXTG|3.0|If ever there was a movie with mixed components it is this one. There are some amazing things in this film and some downright stupid ones. I am sure this movie will be debated for some time. But here is what I disliked, thought was ok, liked.<br />Disliked.<BR>Very little historical accuracy. Starting with the Eagle squadrons. America was Neutral [well sort of] during the Battle of Britain. If an American flew for the RAF he lost his U.S citizenship. It was not something they were encouraged to do. Ben's character signs up and is told his transfer is approved. It just isn't right.<BR>   The love triangle. Done to death and love stories in war films just never seem to work for me. Not when it is rammed down your throat like this one. As well as it being cliche.<BR>    They pick and chose from events and speed through them as fast as they can to keep up with the love story. The movie goes for three hours and they can't find the time to do real events?<BR>    Film makers [Bey I think it was] who say. &quot; No one has ever done a movie like this.&quot; Well he is wrong in a big way and I have three words for him. Tora, Tora, Tora. <BR>    Way to one sided. The patriotic messege is so strong and so one sided for the most part that it doesn't show the story from both sides. The Japanese parts are so quick that it doesn't make alot of sense.    <BR> A weak and extended plot really attack this film and that is a shame.<br />What was ok.<BR>    The initial dating part of the love story I didn't mind. It had some sweet and funny moments. But it soon turned into the triangle and that was the end of reality there.<br />What I liked.<br />   Dan Akroyd as the intelligence officer. A good portrayal for him and over all very underused in the film. Some likable characters. Some of the support characters are quite fun. The Japanese parts of the film are excellent although very disjointed. The pond with the floating models and the Japanese fleet in the background is an amazing shot.The letter home from a Japanese pilot to his father, hoping to bring honor to the family and to do his duty is an interesting touch.<BR>   The Japanese flying into the island. This is one of my favourite parts of the film. The boys playing baseball as the planes fly by, the woman hanging clothes as the zero goes overhead. Absolutly amazing. The attack itself is brilliant. Val's in their dives, Zero's flashing between ships and the torpedo's in the water are just breathtaking.<BR>   The digital sound. Crank it up for the aircraft scenes. The sound is incredible.<br />   But at the end of the day it is a mixed movie. A movie that is far better is Tora, Tora, Tora. It is alot older. But for its day the aerial scenes are amazing and they show the events from both sides. It shows all the major Japanese players and what led Japan to attack Pearl. It details why it had to be Pearl and all the planning and training the Japanese did. It is unbiased. It isn't pro America and it isn't pro Japan. It just shows what happened and why. It talks about the British attack at Taranto against the Italian fleet and how it and Pearl were shallow and normally torpedo's would not work. Overall Tora, Tora, Tora is an incredible film and if you are interested in the historical side of it without romance then give it a watch.<br />    So why did I buy Pearl Harbor? The aircraft scenes pure and simple. I love planes always have since I was a kid.  The aerial scenes and digital sound just drives me wild even though the film is no where near as good as it should have been. If you love aircraft as much as I do then the rewatch value will be there. If you want a historical movie without hollyood plots. Then give this one a miss and buy Tora, Tora, Tora

B00005NSB8|3.0|This album gets a bum rap because &quot;light&quot; sound and its relatively stupid lyrics. The most notable example would be the song Heavy Metal Hamsters. Nonetheless, this album has a precious gem on it - the song Number One, which easily eclipses anything the band put out after 1993. Other than that, there are a few average songs on the album and some poor ones. If you want to avoid this album, get the Number One single, which features a fantastic instrumental - Les Hamburgeois Walkways.

6304504012|5.0|Madonna was well-chosen for the title role of this musical. She is a promiscuous bottle blonde who lost a parent when young, just like the illustrious former First Lady of Argentina. <BR> Eva Peron was a woman who lived fast, died young, left behind a good-looking corpse, and a smashing wardrobe. This film emphasizes at least two of those aspects of Evita's life. Jonathan Pryce bears little resemblance to the real Juan Peron, but he can carry a tune. He never appears to be the menacing dictator that Peron was known to have been, but when he confronts his teenage mistress(sympathetically played by Andrea Corr), or Eva's terminal illness, he comes across as a sheepish little boy who was caught with his hand in the cookie jar.<BR> Victoria Sus captures the streetwise persona that must have been Juana Ibarguren. While the contempt that the widow of Eva's father must have had for her and her five children is understandable, it should be remembered that Eva's mother did what she had to do to survive at a time when women had fewer options. If there is anything to be said for Eva's contraversial rise to power, she did give Argentinian women the vote, which would help to lessen the chances of their having to prostitute themselves in order to survive as she and her mother did.<BR> Antonio Banderas wears many different hats as fellow Argentinian, Che Guevara, who in fact, never met Eva Peron. His subtle tone is quite suitable for rock operas and in fact, it reminds me a little of Ted Neely's singing in &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot;, another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. His mannerisms are mocking and unsymapthetic as he mixes in with all elements of Argentine society, trying to get the scoop on this young woman who has taken her country by storm. <BR> There is a noticeable change in lyrics where certain numbers are concerned. When the song, &quot;And the Money Kept Rolling In&quot; is played, a very important stanza about the Perons' fleecing of their nation's treasury isleft out. I have wondered if the producers of this film had to strike a deal with the Argentinian government to leave that stanza out in order to film in a country where Eva is still so revered. Earlier, Eva's lines in &quot;Peron's Latest Flame&quot; are changed from &quot;Is that the extent of your interest in me? It shows how futile acting must be.&quot; to&quot; Acting is limiting. The lines not mine. That's no help to the Argentine.&quot; But it's great how Lloyd-Webber recreates the two groups most opposed to Eva's rise to power in that song by making the military officers shout their lyrics as military officers would when giving or responding to commands, and the aristocracy sing theirs in a ringing chorale to express their highbrow mannerisms.<BR> Jimmy Nail is given the other standout performance as Eva's first lover, Agustin Magaldi. He has a pleasant voice, but somehow an audience would get the impression that he wasn't all that great a singer. Julian Littman does bear a close resemblance to Eva's devoted brother, Juan.The most comically pathetic character is, perhaps Marcelo Alejandro Marcelli's beautiful-eyed Huevo, the photographer who helps Eva land her first gig as a professional model, only to find himself being spurned by her as she goes on to more advantageous conquests.<BR> The film doesn't capture everything accurately. But it's quite a musical. At once, it is solemn, majestic, passionate, riveting, rollicking, funny,and dignified. It never lets up for a moment as it captures the fire, color and spirit of both its title character and of her beloved Argentina in the early part of the 20th century.
059035342X|5.0|Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone was the best book I have ever read.  It's full of adventure and excitement. <br />The book is about a young boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin because his parents died.  His aunt and uncle never treated him well.  On his eleventh birthday, he recieved a letter from a school for wizards and witches, known as Hogwarts.  The letter said that he has been accepted into the school.  He didn't believe it until the messanger used magic against Harry's uncle which was refusing to let Harry go.<br />So Harry goes off to school and makes some friends that help him learn things about the magic world, since his aunt and uncle never told him a thing about magic and that he was a wizard.  Why he's there he plays a wizard sport called quidditch.  The book has a great ending, and I suggest that you read this if you like adventure stories.
0385484518|4.0|My class was requested to read Tuesdays with Morrie. It is a lovely book about a man who teaches us the best way to find the happiness in ourselves,in others, and in little things. I learned a lot from this book. Especially, how to listen and respect my loved ones. I recommend Tuesdays with Morrie to everyone who needs to take a break from our busy days. You'll feel delighted and touched. Read it and you'll see.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a great read.  it was great how they played out an imagenary land called Narnia.  Narnia is a land that four children find as they play hide and go seek. One of the children, Lucy, the youngest of them all, hid in a wardrobe and found the land of Narnia.<BR>   The land Narnia is ruled by a mean witch.  She makes every season winter. She also turns people into statues.  The children have to try to stop her.<BR>  I think every body should get their hands on this book.  It is a classic.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I first read some of the negative reviews for DRIVING RAIN (bad songs, bad singing, etc.); then I listened to the CD, starting with &quot;Lonely Road&quot; (powerful song, great unpolished vocals and great playing); when I was up to track # 8, I just couldn't imagine what the negatve reviewers were listening to! All the songs up to that point were just perfect, Paul's bass playing is incredible, and at no moment is any song overdone or over-produced (which has been Paul's biggest fault since going solo).<BR>The second half of the CD isn't filler either; good songs and some experimentation ('Jaipur', 'Raindrops' are not great, but are interesting exercises).<BR>'Heather' should have been the closer, and 'Freedom&quot; should have been left out, which feels out-of-place (it's just not strong enough to carry the anthem-like message).<BR>Again, a great CD. Paul found a good band to play some great songs w/o overdoing it. Let's hope he keeps this formula for future projects and we might just see a new phase for Paul in his 60s!

B00000D9TQ|3.0|A respectable but definitely not conclusive gathering of Collins' best hit successes. Because of the fact Collins has completed multiple solo projects over the past two decades, this one disc anthology does not adequately provide ample housing for all his song criteria. Maybe the flip of a coin, but commercial heads probably triumphed. In any event, nice to know good intentions were there. One CD in particular I recommend buying is No Jacket Required; probably Collins' best wrought studio album to date. With it, you'll be sure not to miss the prominent hit songs `Inside Out`, `Don't Lose My Number`, `Only You Know And I Know` and `Long Long Way To Go` - all ignored on this present compilation effort. The tracks `I Don't Wanna Know`, `Who Said I Would` and `We Said Hello, Goodbye` are all of great musical status originality as well.<BR>   <BR>Hits nevertheless, like I previously gave indication to, has at least half of Collins' most appreciated studio singles. All became very popular whether making Billboard's Top Ten or not. In the meantime, No Jacket Required would again be the `Hit-Philled` CD I highly recommend owning apart from Hits. One I guess will have to wait till this former talented Genesis drumming man puts out Hits Vol. 2 for a complete hit listing. I'm optimistic further big hits such the like as `I Missed Again`, `I Don't Care Anymore`, `Like China`, `You'll Be In My Heart`, `Everyday`, `I Cannot Believe It's True` and `Do You Remember?` are additional tracks which should find also their way(s) onto this hopefully prompt counterpart. Three stars may not seem adequate for this retrospective attempt, but when including 3 others in a follow-up, the Orion Nebula should appear no brighter than tiny sparkles to any Woodstock dream believer...
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is a great book to read.It is a book about how George, a small quick guy helps Lennie, a big guy, who is not very smart.Through the story George always helps Lennie.This book makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happens.<BR>  My favorite part about Of Mice and Men is that it has a sad ending.It's not one of those boring story's where it has a happy endind.This book is more unique.
B00004W510|5.0|I've said elsewhere that the Stones' 'Let It Bleed' was the album of 1969, but I forgot about this. I can't decide whether or not it's better than The Band's remarkable debut, 'Music From Big Pink', but in any case it's probably best to follow Levon Helm's lead and treat them as the one work and forget about rating them. <br />The 'brown album' is full of tremendous cuts, notably Robertson's magnificent 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,' sounding starker and drier here than the live versions I've heard, 'The Unfaithful Servant,' with its stupendous Danko vocal and weepy horn outro from Hudson and John Simon, and 'King Harvest (Has Surely Come),' graced with perhaps  Robbie's best solo as well as a very funky rhythm section. <br />While the album owes its greatness to top-shelf songs more than anything else, The Band's ensemble playing is enough to make a person cry (Garth's piano on 'Rag Mama Rag' is, well, indescribable). More than that, you can't help but marvel at the fact that one band could have so many great singers. Put all that together and you have one of the very best albums anyone is likely to make.
0385484518|5.0|The book Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom was an excellent book.  This book was about an old professor who has a disease and he is dying.  One of his old students saw him on tv and saw that he was dying.  Mitch felt bad for not keeping in touch with Morrie even though he had promised he would keep in touch after he graduated from college.  Mitch decided to call his professor and they made an appointment to see each other.  If you want to find out what happens when they see each other you have to read the book.<br />I recommend this book for everyone to read because it has real life experiences.  This book also shows how friendships strengthen and how hard it is to lose someone you truly love.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie starts out promising then gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. The special effects were great but the plot and historical accuracy of the movie was so bad I felt betrayed. It felt to me like they tried to fit the entire history of WW2 in one movie and they did a lousy job at it. The thing I found most pathetic about the movie was the fact that it seemed to be a 3 hour soap opera and a lousy one at that. It also feels like they tried to glamoize what happedned at Pearl Harbour and make the dropping of the atomic bomb seem more justified. What the hell were they thinking these are tragic events both for the Americans and the Japanese if they are to be portayed at least do it realistically and in a more mondane mood. The sad thing about this movie other than its plot was the fact that when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour (about 2 hours into the movie!) the audience is by that time looking forward to seeing it happen and instead of being disturbed by the event they find it exciting and thrilling, why because up to that point the movie is so unbelievbly boring that seeing the carnage actully brings wondering minds back to the movie. All I can say is the director and all those associated with this movie should be ashamed of themselves. (...)
0312979479|4.0|And Then There Were None was a good book. I liked it because it didn't drag on that much. It kept going. Also, some of the words in it were hard to read and understand, but once you got going on it, it was easier to read. <BR>It started out with ten people being invited to Indian Island for a summer vacation by someone that they have never heard of before. Once they get there they go into their rooms and there was the poem &quot;Ten Little Indian Boys&quot;. Each verse is how each murder happens. The first verse says that one indian boy choked himself and the first man that dies had choked himself. Then the next verse says that an Indian boy choked himself and in the story that is what happened in the second murder of the story. And it went that way throughout the book.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Being somewhat of a reticent fan of Whiskeytown and David Ryan Adams, I have to say rewind or fast forward, Adams' work holds up pretty well considering his influences are the same influences of upteen other musicians.  With \\"Gold\\", I had a bit of difficulty getting jazzed about this new record since 1) I was playing Whiskeytown's \\"Stranger's Almanac\\" a LOT and it's very different, and 2) Ryan is a hot ember with the media now, which always gets me nervous for any artist in the limelight. But I have to say, it's remarkable to me that one guy --one YOUNG guy-- can fold Gram Parsons, the Stones, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Jeff Buckley and other easily identifiable influences into one record and do so without making it sound cheap and insincere.  I agree that while the editing could have been a bit better (I don't know what it is with some artists and their need to overdo it...but hey, let's hope they eventually learn), \\"Gold\\" has some incredibly beautiful songs.  My favorites are \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\", \\"When Stars Go Blue\\" and \\"Sylvia Plath\\".  Gorgeous songs, great production.  These songs make me cry, just like a Richard Thompson Black Vincent ballad.  \\"Damn, feels so good it makes me hurt.\\"  I guess I'm thrilled that Adams has the courage to express emotions while still feeling compelled to retain his rootsy Southern boy image.  I also consider this album a great gift for any friend or relative who needs to start listening to some newer, more intriguing stuff, but may be fearful of moving away from Dave Mathews, Hootie or...well, you get the drift.
0312979479|4.0|This book was a very good book and the way it was set up was very different because you would never guess the ending.<br /> It was about 10 people that got letters from someone who was in their past. The letters said that they wanted them to come to an island far away called Indian Island. When they all got there they relized that they were the only ones in the house except the maid and her husbsand, they took care of the house. So they were going to try and leave the next morning but when they went to see if any boats were coming there were none. So they ended up staying there for a while.And the whole book is based on the poem The 10 Little Indians.The only reason I gave it four stars was because I think that the author jamed alot of information in the second chapter and I kind of got confused. It doesn't sound like a good book but I just don't want to give away the ending!
0451457994|4.0|. . .serious science fiction novels ever written.  This reviewer has to agree.<br />From a beginning 10 million years in the past, to the &quot;creation&quot; of whatever it is that David Bowman becomes, 2001: A Space Odyssey grips the reader and doesn't let go.<br />Much has been said about this book; and I'm not going to re-hash what other reviewers have written.  I just wanted to add a few thoughts:<br />1) In the third novel in this series &quot;2061: Odyssey 3&quot; Clarke admits what became evident in the second book (and in the original movie).  There are significant differences between the book and the movie, most importantly, the replacement of Jupiter for Saturn as the destination of &quot;Discovery&quot;.  While Saturn's moon Iaptus was a more &quot;believable&quot; destination (and location for the Monolith) the story could not have been sustained over several novels.<br />2) From a perspective of 35 years later, it is interesting to see Clarke's perspective of the &quot;Cold War&quot; and how it would affect man in space.<br />3) Clarke's theology is present in this book -- and only becomes more clear throughout the subsequent volumes.  It is an utterly humanistic theology centered on the evolution of mind.  Nevertheless, there remains still hints of the transcendent (also visible in several of Clarke's other novels) which clearly disturb the otherwise cold rationality of his thought.
0312979479|3.0|The book And Then there Were None was very interesting. This book was about ten people that were invited to go to a mansion on Indian Island. Through the book they all end up dieing one by one in the same way as the indians in the childrens poem Ten Little Indians. The mystery is to find out who is the person that is killing them off. The book gives you hints to who the the killer my be, and just when you think you know who the killer is that person may get killed. To find out who the killer is you have to read it for yourself.<br />I thought that this wood was very interesting and a great mystery. To many people this may be the kind of book that you can't put down,but to me it was the kind of book that i liked to put down. Then when i finished it I thought over all it was a good book. I donbt think i would read it again. I think many people may think different because i am not the kind of person that reads a lot of books, and it talks a lot for me to really to into the book.
B00005RFAI|5.0|First, I must say that this album was NOTHING like I expected it to be!  I actually avoided buying it when it debuted, even though I thoroughly enjoy the first single &quot;Get This Party Started.&quot;  My reasoning for not being interested was that I thought it would be laced with rap/hip-hop, which I generally do not like.  Well, two days ago, I bought it on a spontaneous purchase and have not been able to stop listening to it!  I think it is one of the best albums of the year.  Pink displays such versatility with her song writing and styles on her album that it should secure her as serious singer/songwriter andhas certianly set her WAY apart from other acts that she has been compared to.  <br />It is important to say that, though this album is brilliant, it will be for everyone, including those fans who strictly enjoyed the &quot;old&quot; Pink, who focused more on Pop/Hip-hop/R&amp;B.  Those of us, however, that have various musical tastes and can respect an artist who displays her true creativity and versatility, should not be dissapointed.  Though I don't like comparing artists, if I had to compare I would say that her new style and sound is like Alanis Morrissette (though not as deep and with more of a pop influence), No Doubt, and maybe Sheryl Crow.  There are some really great, well-written songs on this album, my favs being &quot;Just Like A Pill,&quot; &quot;18 Wheeler,&quot; and &quot;Family Potrait.&quot;  <br />This album proves Pink as a serious artist, and whether you like the album and her new sound or hate it, you HAVE to give her accolades for being bold enough to change show her versatility and succeeding so flawlessly!
0385473788|4.0|The reason why I gave this book a four star review is because it explains the real life of a young girl living through one of the most dramatic times of our history. Her name is Anne Frank one of the millions killed during the Holocaust because she was jewish.<br />Her family has been discriminated and was treated very poorly because of there religion.The ruler of Germany at time despised all kinds of jewish people not because of the person in general<br />but because they were jewish.Anne Frank wrote her thoughts and feelings while she was in hiding,fear that her family may get caught by the nazis.<br />If you enjoy books that explain about how someone can treat people so cruel and how real life realy is you would enjoy this book very much.

0140177396|4.0|I like Of Mice And Men by John Steinbeck because the definition of the characters was so realistic.

0345357116|5.0|(2) Admittedly Unfinished Tales is recommendable ONLY to those who have read The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings (definitely including the Appendices) and Silmarillion.  On the other hand, anyone who's read those 5 volumes of legendarium is ILL-advised to stop short of this astounding book.  The opening brace of chapters are cinematic redactions of Silmarillion episodes from the late '50s, in which THE NAMES GET BETTER.  If you've labored patiently in learning to pronounce the Elvish names as intended, you MUSTN't miss this.  Chapters in the middle section enlarge dazzlingly on the Appendices' account of the &quot;Second Age&quot; linking the Silmarillion with the hobbit books, making Unfinished Tales the real KEY to the FULL SCOPE of JRRT's metahistorical imagination.  The chapters chosen by young Chris for the closing Third-Age section thus operate in THIS FRAME, giving EXTRA DIMENSION (which shouldn't be possible!) to the hobbit books' meticulously epical narratives.  So, yes, it's a supplement; but WHAT a supplement.<br />(1) On the scholarly side, Tolkien changed everything for medieval lit study.  Having washed in on the crest of modern comparative linguistics, he brought an unprecedentedly literary sensibility to philology of the postClassical, preRenaissance works (Beowulf, the Elder Edda, the Mabinogion et hoc genus) which have come to be readily available in readable translations ONLY since Ace bootlegged the hobbit books in the mid'60s.  Unfinished Tales is the crossroads between JRRT's scholarship and legendarium--key not only to the Second Age but indeed to an integrated perspective on his unique career.

B00000JNNY|5.0|I had never really paid much attention to Etta James growing up in the 60's.  But a year ago I heard some absolutely beautiful music while visiting my son and his girlfriend.  It was Etta James.  What a voice. I do not know how I missed her before, but now I have found her. Within days I had tracked down this CD.  I play it at least once a week.  I am not a musician, but I certainly recognize the quality of her voice, the range, and her fantastic control.  This is an essential CD for anyone who enjoys female R&amp;B.

B00003CXAQ|4.0|This one is my favorite of the trilogy. It is often criticized for being more violent than Raiders & Crusade which I think is unfair. The other two films have people getting run over, blown up, diced by airplane propellors, melted, etc. Granted the chilled monkey brains are a bit much, but the beautiful locations kind of make up for this, and I think the mine-car chase on the tracks is one of the best action sequences of all time. It seems to have inspired a couple of computer animation videos.
B00003CXTG|5.0|It was with trepidation that I bought this DVD as I had heard so many bad reviews and it had failed at the cinema. To my delight I thought it was great. I really got into the characters, the special effects were stunning and you saw both angles from both the American and Japanese sides. Was it factually correct? I don't know but it was a thrill a minute and the 3 hours flew by. I watch a movie to be entertained and taken away from the strains of every day life and this did if for me. As with Armageddon it was way over the top but blooming great!!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|The movie has incredible performances by the actors, mainly by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, who sing quite a lot. The pace of the movie is a little bit crazier than Romeo + Juliet, but also very different, even if it is a curtain flick.<BR>the impossible lovy story concept is somewhat simplified by Nicole Kidman's turning point sickness. But it never becomes sad as something unavoidable. It's a lovestory in spite of the fact of the structure where the couple is in trouble but still get to be together in the end, is a happy ending. It's a good movie because it resonates the 20th century of love songs and not only those, but the mile stones of that century music. it unites it in the year of 1900, which i think is symbolic for the 20th century even though it takes place in the 1900, as you can see on the costumes and designs, to add color i guess.<BR>It's also a cheat thing to take the best bits of a few love songs and turn it into something unique but not original. But when it's made you see the original quality of the outline, and the result is simply put entertaining. amazing and somewhat chaotic, but as you sit through it it's settling and sad at one point but reuniting of love hope and life from a century of song,<BR>okay?
0805062971|5.0|I loved the twists and turns of the movie, &quot;Fight Club&quot;. It has become one of the cult classic movies of our generation. When I learned that it was taken from a book, I had to buy the book. From the first page, I was immediately sucked into the story, even knowing what was to happen after seeing the movie. I stayed up until 4 in the morning to finish reading it! I was not dissappointed and was pleased to discover little idiosyncrasies that the movie could not portray accurately. From the detailed information of &quot;Tyler Durden's&quot; night jobs to the initiation rites of the Space Monkeys, this book was captivating! I have even passed it along to several of my friends to read. The screenplay was great and very well adapted from the book, but yet again, the book is better than the movie.

B000002LND|5.0|This, people, is the Madonna record for people who claim to hate Madonna.  With the glorious exception of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, all of the Material Girl's albums up to this point were pretty much &quot;three brillaint singles+filler&quot;, making them mixed affairs indeed.  Luckily, the only filler to be found here is the new track &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, which is relegated to the end of the disc and is, therefore, easily avoided.  That such smashes as &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Dress You Up&quot;, &quot;Who's That Girl&quot;, &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;, and &quot;Burning Up&quot; had to be omitted should make it plain that this is a heavy duty complilation, one that keeps the hits coming fast and furious.  No other artist since The Beatles has managed to put forth such a vast amount of sublime ear candy in such a short period of time.  From the throbbing &quot;Into the Groove&quot; to the explosive &quot;Express Youself&quot; to delightfully retro &quot;Cherish&quot;, these songs are eternal classics and only get better with each listen.  My personal favorites are &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, with its unforgettable chorus, and the majestic &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.  You'll have your favorites, too, after giving this blockbuster a listen.
B00005QFE5|5.0|&quot;The Road Home&quot; is made by my favorite foreign director around today! I don't count Bergman because he just writes now. But  Zhang Yimou, the director of this film, always manages to put such beauty into his films. Probably best known for films like &quot;Not One Less&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Traid&quot;, &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;, &amp; &quot;To Live&quot;. &quot;The Road Home&quot; follows in his tradition of making powerful, beautiful films.<br /> I've seen about 60 films this year, and I know that's not a lot when compared to how many critics see. But, I think it's a pretty large amount when compared to the amount that the average movie fan goes to see. From everything I've seen this year, nothing has been able to express the passion of this film! No film has been as tender, poignant, &amp; embarcive as this. I hate to admit this, for it's not really manly, but, I was misty by the end of the film. I've not seen a film that could do that to me in a long time.<br /> Many bash this film saying, there's no story. It doesn't move. There's no point to it. How wrong they are. Of course there's a story to the film. I was watching something all that time lol. It's a very innocent, simple story that captivates it's audience. A young man, Yusheng (Honglei Sun) goes back home after hearing about the death of his father. A local school teacher, who helped build the very same school where he worked. His mother is grief-stricken, understandablely. There's an old tradition that after one dies, one must be brought back to where they lived. Only they must be brought back by foot! Other's must carry the coffin so the person's soul will remember how to get back home. Yusheng mother, will not give in. She demands that the townspeople follow the old tradition. Afterwards, Yunsheng starts thinking about his mother and father, he sees a picture of them taken the day of their marriage. It makes him think about the story of how they met. And, this is where the film starts to take off. Granted, it sounds simple, but, please don't dismiss it. Just think of &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;. It takes a simple story, and does something with it, many films, no matter how complex their story-line may be can do. &quot;The Road Home&quot; is the same way. It may sound simple, but, give it a chance, trust me, you'll be impressed.<br /> I really, really love this movie. Everything about it seems to fall together in perfect pieces. The music by Bao San is charming. It hits all the romantic and dramatic spots it needed to. The script based on the book &quot;Remembrance&quot; written by Shi Bao, as is the script, is truly wonderful. It carries such heart with it. It makes us care about the characters so much. We can't help but get drawn into their lives. The film did more in 89 minutes then any Hollywood film I saw this year! I know, many people dislike having to read the sub-titles on these type of films, but, please, make an effort to see this one. I think this film will stay with me for a long,long time.<br />p.s.- This film has already won and been nominated for many awards including; a Sundance Film Festival Award, a Bodil Awards, and a Berlin International Film Festival Award.ake off.

The script based on the book &quot;Remembrance&quot; written by Shi Bao, as is the script, is truly wonderful. It carries such heart with it. It makes us care about the characters so much. We can't help but get drawn into their lives. The film did more in 89 minutes then any Hollywood film I saw this year! I know, many people dislike having to read the sub-titles on these type of films, but, please, make an effort to see this one. I think this film will stay with me for a long,long time.<br />p.s.- This film has already won and been nominated for many awards including; a Sundance Film Festival Award, a Bodil Awards, and a Berlin International Film Festival Award.
630575067X|4.0|Of all the movies released in recent years, undoubtedly the one that has been given the most unjustified criticism in recent years is &quot;Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantomn Menace&quot;. The reasons for this are varied, but the truth is that this movie is quite good. This is of course Chapter One in a six part story (a fact most critics of the movie seem not to understand the implications of:). The movie is therefore not going to give you a &quot;they all lived happily ever after&quot; though it is amaingly able to come close to it. Brilliant effect is piled onto brilliant effect and there are many great sequences: the journey through the planet core, the escape from Naboo, the pod race, and on through the finale.<br />The only criticism is that some of the acting is a little stiff (Natalie Portman's Queen Amidala is a little weak though she does just fine as handmaiden Padme) and that C3PO is left on Tatooine and thus misses the last third of the movie.<br />I would point out that once Episodes 2 and 3 are released, I believe the reputation of Phantomn Menace will soar, as I am sure there was some forshadowing in various places that one just can't see without seeing Episodes 2 and 3.
B00003CX5P|5.0|It was the 2nd best Star Wars movie so far (the best was Return of the Jedi).
B00003CXTG|4.0|A movie that will live in our memory forever. I think that this movie gives us just a little more than just the attack on pearl. It gives us a glimpse of what it was like in those days.The attack on pearl is the best attack seqence of all time period.The picture is great and the audio is great if you can sit thru some slow scenes than you will be rewarded with one of the most moving action the camera has ever filmed. just go out and buy this disc please.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|First I would like to say to the people who say they are prince fans I would give the album a chance.  I wouldn't just listen to it once and say it is stupid. I love every album prince has ever made and I wouldn't tell him to give it up. Because prince is the best and I don't want him to stop making music but to keep his music alive.  I had a hard time following the narration but after listening to it 6 or more times you start to figure it out and start grooving to the music.  I hope he don't keep making relgious music I hope he makes stuff like he use to.  I don't think he is just starting to make good music I always thought he did.  I loved the Rave Cd and the Emancipation, all his cds.  I would try to give this cd another chance.  But I really do hope he starts making albums like the gold experience and yet sell it again if he can.  I would really love to have that album.  Oh and prince you still capture the young audience I'm only 18 and my sister is only 16 and usually teens don't listen to your type of music but let me tell you you do have young viewers out there so can you still make songs for the young audience to.  Thank you, Oh and you really are a genious and the sexist man alive.
1884822312|4.0|I must confess I refused to do what I had to do in order to improve my game for so long.  There are many reasons for this - mainly that working on what troubles you can often cause great anguish.  It can be a most painful process, believe you me.  It is similar to how I feel when I do physical exercise.  I hate doing my regular four-mile jog while I'm doing it, but I feel great when it's over.  <BR>     Lazlo Polgar's book is a tactical workout that forces the beginner/intermediate player to acquire the essential tactics necessary for survival.  I reached an ICC rating of about 1750 before I got the book and having gotten about half way through, I am currently at about 1850.  I do three pages a day and mark my answers directly in the book, which I then grade.  I have worked my way up from an accuracy rate of 90% to a steady 98% for the mate in two's, which is the type of puzzle that comprises the majority of the book.  The reason why I do three pages a day is because I figured there is slightly over a thousand pages, so I will complete the book in a year.  I was at first turned off by the book because I thought that there were too many check mate puzzles and not enough 'regular tactics' and endgame puzzles but I soon found that the checkmate puzzles are good for way more.  <BR>     I look at positions way more in depth.  I used to deal with tactical situations by saying to myself, I take, he takes, I take, he checks, I block, he forks, etc.  Now I look at the squares in the enemy camp and take note of what is strong, and what is weak.  I know how to stage a plan based on controlling crucial squares and win or lose, I play more interesting games in general.  I understand the value of the initiative way better than I did in the past.  I am always looking to sacrifice material (especially the Queen) for an attack, and recognize how to judge a position based on piece activity as opposed to merely counting material.<BR>     What really forced me to purchase the book wasthe section in the back containing miniature games that involve kingside attacks targeting the crucial squares f3, f6, g3, g6, h3, and h6.  It is probably the most important part of the book because it illustrates the kingside attack in a real game situation.  At about [a good price], it is worth it to get the book simply for its collection of games.
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is nothing less than a masterpiece.  (...)
B00003CXP1|5.0|I don't think there's anything more I can add to the already great reviews given to this film, but I just can't recommend it enough.  Everyone I know who's watched it has been affected by it in some way, so it is much more than your usual film.  Do yourself a favor and watch this!
B00000K3CK|5.0|The best christmas movie made.Its timeless.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; amazed me at the theater, and now it has truly astounded me on DVD.<BR>This 2-disc &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; package is the ultimate for any DVD collector.<BR>Finally, we can watch this amazing film experience with the benefit of a remote control....something I longed for in the theater!<BR>Watching &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; and being able to freeze-frame, slow-motion and skip, jump and rewind to all your favorite scenes over and over again adds an extra dimension of viewing pleasure.<BR>This package is absolutely crammed with extra features that will keep you amused for hours.<BR>My favorite is on disc-2 in &quot;The Dance&quot; section. Finally, we can watch the fabulous &quot;Tango Roxanne&quot; routine as it should have been seen....UNEDITED and in its entirety! Truly breathtaking stuff!<BR>There are so many other extra features worthy of mention here, but why should I spoil the fun of exploring and discovering them for yourselves?<BR>There are also 10 Easter Eggs hidden throughout the two discs. One classic is Nicole and Ewan clowning around during a take of &quot;Your Song&quot;....very funny stuff indeed!<BR>Take it from me, you won't be disappointed with this purchase. It will take pride of place in your collection....Come What May!
B000002UJQ|2.0|I'm the first to say that \\"Airbag\\" is one of the best tunes I've ever heard, certainly the most dramatic uses of the bass guitar and drums, and I could listen to that song and \\"Let Down\\" thousands of times....but C'MON!  These guys are FAR from being the saviors of music and all the other cliches I always read.  <BR>The rest of this album simply STINKS.  Same with the ones that came later, and the first one.  Obviously, \\"The Bends\\" is a good album, but is it any better than the bands that came before or after them?  <BR>So many other bands made better records than Radiohead.  My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Stone Roses, Flaming Lips, the Wedding Present...and their attempts at mixing it up and supposedely 'pushing the envelope' of music with \\"Kid A\\"??  Unbelievable!  This was another case of them doing something mediocre that countless bands had done well before them.  Severed Heads, Psychic TV, even Laibach made better songs in the same vein.  <BR>I suspect most people who are blown away by this album were just getting into music about a year before they bought this record.  Probably never really listened to anything but the radio.  For them, this is groundbreaking and all the other adjectives.  But for the rest of us, we're left scratching our heads, saying \\"What genius?\\"
B00005N83M|4.0|Well,I have read all the reviews, and people keep on harping on the fact that she CANT sing! Ok, she does have vocal talents, she just needs to have a vocal coach to extent her range. Mostly, this is just her second album, and she is still trying everything, maybe on the next album she will refine one sound. I dont compare La Lopez to other artists like Christina(who can sing, my God, she won a Grammy!) and Britney, who really has no talent at all! <BR>I think J. Lo is just having fun with something. She is just enjoying the ability to entertain people. Nowadays, with all the bad things in the world, someone should be doing something.<BR>Anyway, I think she does have some weak songs-her slow jams&quot;Secretly&quot; and &quot;Come over&quot; are not the best. But, the hits &quot;Im Real&quot;, &quot;Love...&quot; and so on are good, with &quot;Play&quot; being one of the best songs along with &quot;Walking on Sunshine&quot;, the album is not so bad. But, in my opinion, she sings much better in Spanish, her voice is much stronger! <BR>Anyway, buy it, it isnt so bad, at least not as bad as some trash out there today....Britney, BSB, NSync....etc...
B0000033WC|3.0|But only because of Sweet Jane, which was the first Velvets song I ever heard. This band has a nasty habit of dropping it's members. First we lost Nico, then Cale, and Maureen Tucker doesn't even play on this record. Instead we have.... Doug Yule! &lt;sarcasm&gt;Oh Joy!&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br />Sweet Jane is awesome, Rock And Roll is good and I like Who Loves The Sun, but the rest isn't really worth hearing. The outtakes are also rather boring. You'd do better to get the Peel Slowly and See box set.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I realize that no one agrees with my point of view when it comes to this film, and that is quite fine with me.  This movie might work for a person who has been dulled by viewing MTV 12 hours a day 7 days a week.  However, anyone who enjoys great theater has no choice but to squirm though this so-called \\"musical\\" (isn't a musical composed of original songs?).  The music is dreadful.  The arrangements are terrible.  Originality... I think not.  Instead we are bombarded with the most irritating sequence of recycled garbage that has ever been on the big screen.  I believe the \\"Like a Virgin\\" sequence was my breaking point, though it's hard to isolate the straw.  Thank God I was with someone who forced me to watch the rest, because had I not stayed I wouldn't have known with absolute certainly that this was one of the worst 10 movies that I had ever seen.  When I saw Romeo and Juliet a few years ago, I remember how dreadful and insulting it was to sit through.  I am not impressed with cinematography for cinematography's sake.  How any producer could think that Luhrmann's technique (one similar to the one he used in Romeo and Juliet) was worthy of another dreadful opus is anybody's guess.  I heard today that this work is being given consideration for best picture of the year.  God, please allow this work to pass into obscurity where it belongs.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album is awesome, but you should know what you are getting into. Basically, it's 45 minutes of noise with some gorgeous melodies and great lyrics thrown in. The title track just rocks, and I Heard Her Call My Name is a great rock song. The Gift and Lady Godiva's Operation are really really disturbing (that breathing noise just creeps me out). Sister Ray may sound like 17 minutes of static and feedback, but it really does grow on you, and you can hear that there's a lot going on if you pay attention. Overall a great, influential album.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|i wasn't too interested in writing a review but i feel there are too many negative reviews of PRINCE'S latest release on here. the 1st thing you MUST realize BEFORE purchasing this CD is that it is NOT a POP album in the traditional sense. if that's what you want then buy &quot;VERY BEST OF PRINCE&quot; CD. this is a conceptual album that is stylistically similar to LOVESEXY in that the songs feel interwoven and meant to be heard as a whole. the music has PRINCE playing nearly all the instruments (except drums and horns) yet it sounds like a live band. if you liked PRINCE'S MADHOUSE project you should like this. his playing hasn't been this inspired in a LONG time.  also like LOVESEXY, PRINCE'S lyrics are telling us of his new found spirituality. this time, however, it seems that it may not be as universal and may be leaning towrds a specific faith. this appears to be people's main gripe about this CD. i suggest to listen to it as PRINCE telling a story rather than preaching a religion. after all, GOD has been a lyrical theme in his music for about 20 years. in my opinion it is a LOT more uplifting and meaningful than the disposable trash music cluttering our airwaves today.it is this sort of brainwashing done by the major labels that makes this cd so foreign sounding to most. i admit to being a bit biased as i am a diehard P-fan but can readily admit that his last few albums have not been anything to shout about. however, i feel THE RAINBOW CHILDREN is quite good with the potential of becoming a classic ala LOVESEXY. just give it a couple of spins and you should feel it to.
B000002G7G|3.0|This is the Velvets weakest album, IMHO. The driving rhythms, catchy hooks, killer guitar solos and feedback noises have all disappeared with John Cale. OK, OK, Pale Blue Eyes is good, and Murder Mystery is an interesting concept, but most of the songs are just boring, slow, and sappy. Not that all slow sappy songs are bad, Stephanie Says is wonderful and should have been on this album, but these are just sub-par. Bring back Cale, I say.

B00005A1PR|4.0|India.Arie's CD is one of my fave releases of 2001. The tracks are fresh, sexy, and soulful. Ms. Arie's lyrics are uplifting, sensual, and poetic. This is the kind of CD, you can play in front of your older family members, and not have to edit out the curses, and/or inappopriate sexual references.<BR>My favorite tracks are the popular &quot;Video&quot;, which deals with issues of beauty, and not falling to society's standards on the topic. I also love &quot;Nature&quot;. It is one of the best love songs to date, without the usual sappiness. Go pick up this CD! It's a true must have.

0451196716|5.0|A contest pitting children against one another in a charity walk from hell?  Sounds like fun.<br />King/Bachman has come up with a great story line here, and its so fitting in today's \\"reality\\" show market.  Its a combination of Orwell's 1984 and another Bachman book, the Running Man, that will leave you wanting more.<br />The story starts off with a group of boys getting ready for the walking competition.  The characters come from all walks of life and they all have different purposes for winning the competition.<br />(...)P>Its a great read, even for someone who isn't a King/Bachman fan.
B000000OS2|5.0|tesla rocks ! this cd is good. i lost it a few years ago, and ive been really missing it, but i keep telling myself im going to buy it, im going to buy it.. so im buying it again now !! its that good ! its a must have ..
B000002B7O|5.0|Firstly i wannna tell all guys out there that ozzy has the best voice on the earth.I came across many reviews which state that ozzy's voice (is bad)and many biographies on the net state the same.If u think so then i think u need to listen to \\"Suicide Solution\\".Now when ozzy got kicked outta black sabbath  he started a solo career and released the master piece \\"Blizzard of ozz\\" which is probably the best metal album till date.Now when this album was released everyone was surprised.Then people thought the madman was gonna be a one hit album guy.So ozzy needed a follow up.That was sufficiently provided through this masterpiece.It was the second and the final album in which randy---the legend played.It has beautiful guitar riffs especially on \\"over the mountain\\" which is probably the best song on the album.\\"You cant kill rock and roll\\" is a half ballad as it starts of slowly but gains a little speed in the later part of the song.\\"Flying high again\\" and \\"Diary of a madman\\" are the other highlights on the album.\\"Tonight\\" is a beautiful ballad comparrable to the likes of \\"Goodbye to romance\\" or \\"Old L.A Tonight\\".Randy lives on!!
B00005QAPH|5.0|Fellini's 8 1/2 is one of the great filmgoing experiences from one of the four or five greatest filmmakers who has ever lived.  There is nothing like watching Fellini spin his magic in one of his many classic works, and 8 1/2 is the finest of the lot.<BR>As with most of his best work, the film is virtually plotless and filled with scenes of great creative energy.  The film follows a movie director named Guido whose life is slowly spinning out of control while shooting his latest picture.  All manner of &quot;groupies&quot; and hangers on keep interrupting his life as does the crew, his mistress and wife.  On top of this, he faces a creative &quot;block&quot; and is disturbed by recurring nightmares, dreams and visions.  <BR>This is a GREAT film, and as usual, Criterion has presented it in a very fine package.  The supplemental material on this set is superb, it's really one of the best DVD releases this year.  <BR>Oh, and as for our friend from Salt Lake, UT down below, what can you expect from someone who spells Voila! as he does.

B000002H97|5.0|OK, I like Metallica's earlier stuff better.  But I can't sit here and tell you this is not a great CD.  It was my first introduction to Metal.  Every song is solid.  Make this your introduction to Heavy Metal.  But buy Master of Puppets next.  That's Metallica's best album.
0553579908|4.0|I picked up the first of this series of books directly after finishing Tolkiens immortal trilogy as well as the Silmarillion.  I was hoping to find something as engrossing and exciting as Tolkien's masterpiece but unfortunately I was dissapointed.  However, I did persevere and finished the first, and now I am glad to say after having finishing the second that it was well worth the time spent and I can't wait for the third to come out on paperback (so I'm cheap).  Mr. Martin paints an extremely elaborate picture that I feel could occupy atleast 5 more books, and to that I say &quot;Bring 'em on&quot;.  Though he does get a little caught up in the details (does he love food or what?), overall the books are very entertaining and worth the time spent reading their 800+ pages.  They may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy good fantasy you may want to pick these books up.
B000009EAD|5.0|This is where I would start (and where I did start) if I wanted an introduction to Iced Earth.  Listen to the Something Wicked Trilogy.  If you don't like it, you'll never like Iced Earth.  Those three songs are worth the price of the CD alone.  When you add all the other great songs you have one of my favorite albums.  I will note, however (and I'm not really complaining here), it sounds like Iced Earth were channeling Metalica's &quot;And Justice For All&quot; at the time this was made.  Several songs have riffs that sound similar to ones on Metalica's album.  The most obvious example is the opening riff of &quot;Burning Times&quot; which sounds like the main riff on Metalica's &quot;Shortest Straw&quot; (yet the songs are very different--and both great.)  You also have the same cold, raw, and heavy feel.  That said, in no way are these songs rip offs of Metalica songs.  They are very original.  Instead, I think of this as where Metalica might have gone if they had continued to follow the direction suggested by AJFA.  So buy this album.  And listen to the Something Wicked Trilogy first.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This film is in the same league as 'The Titanic', production-wise, treatment-wise, and quality-wise.  Sonics are stunning, given the THX soundtrack, and what appears to be meticulous digital mastering, and the video quality is equally phenomenal.  I would even venture to say it is state of the art DVD reference quality, especially viewed on a larger hi-res HDTV ready screen.  This was a perfect melding of love story meets the fury of war!  OK, 3 hours is WAY too long for a movie (Hollywood should stick to 2 hour flicks), but I managed to enjoy this movie for what it tried to portray, mainly a human element amidst all the carnage and death raining down from above.  The special effects are stunning, and all in all, I would rate this a solid 5 stars, given this film's tour-de-force production, and the accuracy of it.  Rent this one if you want to give your DVD player/TV a workout!
B000002HRE|1.0|There are about 4 decent songs here, none of them really great.  The rest are really bad.  I don't know what happened with this CD and with Load (which is also terrible).  Metallica says they were just in a &quot;phase&quot; when they made Load and Reload.  Let's hope they return to greatness with their next effort.
B00005U122|5.0|I saw this show live in Houston.  If the DVD captures only half of the energy and tallent of the live show its worth double the price.  If you are a Waters fan or a Pink Floyd fan you will love this DVD. In his live shows, Waters dose not quite capture the &quot;right&quot; sound on the Floyd songs, but they are still very good.  His solo songs sound as good live as they do on the studio recordings. Hopefully this will be released in wide screen format.........
B000000WA4|5.0|I love all of the cd's by the Smashing Pumkins including Adore and Gish (I love D'Arcy) and this being 2 discs is double the amount of wonderful alt. I hope that anyone who buys this is as pleased with the outcome as me. I love Tonight, Tonight since the video is fabulous and so wonderfully done. The Smashing Pumkins will forever remain one of my favourite bands and I hope that many, many, many (!) people will buy this cd!
0783221487|5.0|In an age when science fiction movies are exercises computer generated graphics and muppet shows gone wild, this film stands out.  The acting is first class.  The director never lost focus.  The plot follows Frank Herbert's masterpiece to a &quot;T.&quot;<br />My only criticism is that the producers or the studio left out much of the background from book.  Of course, it would have been as long as &quot;Shogun&quot; in that case.
B000001E3V|5.0|...This music is beyond definition, its almost like the words of the song are peripheral to the music that happens here. Almost like the main guitar riff is sort of some obscure reference point from which the real music is played. I can't listen to it without having it so loud that I could hear it if I were deaf. GET THIS ALBUM.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Lighten up!  The film and DVD are both fantastic.  Any true Star Wars fans will love every minute of it.
B000002MTU|5.0|Between this disc and Jimi Hendrix Blues, I have been converted into an avid blues lover.  I can't even imagine why anyone would try to criticize this disc, it is pure blues joy.  Eric Clapton's music rises to the level of exquisite craftmanship, whatever he does.  Saying that he's not a blues great misses the fact that &quot;E.C. is God&quot;, this was written for good reason.  I would learn the guitar just to play this album, or better yet, to be able to play &quot;Mean Old World&quot; found on his &quot;Blues&quot; double disc.  From the emotional high of &quot;Tore Down&quot; to the slower &quot;Sinners Prayer&quot; this disc is flawless.  BTW, check out Freddie King if you'd like to hear serious Clapton influences.  If you want more excellent E.C. Guitar, check out Derek and The Dominoes, Live at the fillmore (it makes me get goosebumps)!!!!
B00005QB9A|5.0|As many other reviewers have stated, it is an absolute shame that this film wasn't presented to the American public with the advertising vigor of Titanic.  Much like Titanic, this film has fantastic effects that make the ship seem real.  Much unlike Titanic, the story is interesting, and the acting is supurb.  The overall cinematography is absolutely captivating, and the music is so engrossing that it washes over you like the water the ship travels on.  This is by far the best film I have ever seen, and I recommend the DVD, as it should be viewed in widescreen.
B00003CXTF|5.0|As if all the reviews about this movie were less than 3 stars!!! (...) Geez... this movie was amazing. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me think about the things that happened before I was even born. I loved this flick and I'd say it is a *Must-see* for anyone that knows (...).
6302794331|5.0|If you are reading this review, chances are that you are as familiar with the story of Ebenezer Scrooge as you are with The Wizard of Oz. Who doesn't know the classic tale? Did you know the story of A Christmas Carol has been filmed over 200 times, the first film being made in 1908? Adaptations have run the gamut, from strict adherence to the story to the irreverent (Blackadder's Christmas Carol, 1988) and the modern (Scrooged, also 1988.)<br />Assuming you are already familiar with the tale, what makes an adaptation superior? Any story well known enough to have practically risen to the status of folktale is at risk of being so familiar its message becomes tired if not presented compellingly. On the surface, the broad plot action of A Christmas Carol might be summed up in the sentence: Scrooge gets scared straight. The challenge of any adaptation is to impress the audience of the personal joy that inhabits anyone who embraces generosity and kindness - we can all deduce that the lives of Bob Cratchit's family will improve financially, and that the poor in general will benefit from Scrooge's transformation: but what about the man himself? The beauty of the tale is of a bitter man who, in the end, really is given more than he can ever give. Even extremely liberal adaptations like Scrooged understood this: the real message in that film was summed up by Bill Murray in the closing sequence, where he tells his audience that once you start giving, you'll get a wonderful feeling, and &quot;You'll want it EVERY DAY.&quot;<br />The film must inspire us to do likewise, not to mention entertain us along the way. Think the muppets are just for kids? Wrong! There's enough sophisticated humor embedded in this film to give anyone a laugh, largely provided by its narrators, The Great Gonzo (as Dickens) and his sidekick, Rizzo the Rat. There are other detail changes to the old story slipped in to spice up the old tale for those familiar with it - just hearing the august Michael Caine sincerely utter the line, &quot;Why, it's Fozziwig's old rubber chicken factory! I had my first job there&quot; is enough to set us laughing.<br />Let's talk about the ghosts. A successful adaptation has just got to have good ghosts, and the presentations here are wonderful. Christmas Past is represented by an ethereal child, voiced wonderfully; Christmas Present is the most welcoming spirit, voiced marvelously by Jerry Nelson (a muppet veteran) - these are the speaking spirits, and both are stunning muppet creations. True to tradition, Christmas Yet to Come does not speak, and manages to be chilling and stern without being too frightening to children (this creation is faceless, and for some reason that spooks grownups more than kids.)<br />Michael Caine is an absolutely fantastic Scrooge, very human and real. It's no small feat to interact realistically with non-human counterparts - even if they are the wonderful muppets - and Caine does this with vigor, gusto, and humility.<br />The only weak spot in the film is the detail on Scrooge's lost love; no one really seems to do this well. It's not very interesting for children (uck, the kissing stuff!) and it's too tired for adults. This section of the film also sports the only disappointing musical number (the rest are great.) Don't let this stop you, though - it's brief.<br />Why such a long review for the muppets? Because I think Brian Henson is simply doing the best family filmaking out there today. As I stated in a review of Muppet Treasure Island, such films must have appeal for all family members, and A Muppet Christmas Carol is no exception. Make it part of your family tradition this year.sincerely utter the line, &quot;Why, it's Fozziwig's old rubber chicken factory!

B00005N9CV|5.0|My music listening started as a teenager in 1940. In the Navy barracks in 1945 I was introduced to classical music which I still like a lot, I have favorites of course.  Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald have been my favorites since 1940, that is until Diana Krall came along.  I still like them but &quot;When I Look into Your Eyes&quot; came to my attention, I began to wonder.  Then &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was published, I purchased it and started to listen, almost every day, the more I heard it, the more I liked it.  I am convinced that this is the best album I have ever heard, bar none.  I like big orchestras and good singing.  This one is the greatest.  Whoever did the arranging deserves a lot of credit.  The earlier albums she did leave a lot to be desired.<BR>Most people who like jazz should listen to this.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I bought \\"Pop\\" last year before the release of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\". The only songs with which I was familiar were \\"Staring At The Sun\\" and \\"Discotheque\\", both of which I mildly enjoyed. After one listen, I fell in love with \\"Do You Feel Loved\\", \\"Gone\\" and \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\"; but the rest of the album left me cold (\\"Wake Up Dead Man\\", \\"Mofo\\"), or just plain annoyed me (\\"Miami\\", \\"The Playboy Mansion\\", \\"Please\\").    A year has passed and, now, I can't get enough of this album. It's full of danceable grooves, and, much to my surprise, deeply personal and spiritual lyrics. Only \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Do You Feel Loved\\", and \\"Mofo\\" live up to the techno billing that preceded the album's release. The rest of the album's music is traditional U2 stadium rock. \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" is a haunting, beautiful U2 ballad, in the tradition of \\"All I Want Is You\\" and \\"Love Is Blindness\\". \\"Staring at the Sun,\\" \\"Last Night On Earth\\", and \\"Gone\\" would fit in on any of the group's albums from the early 90s. In fact, \\"Staring at the Sun\\" is probably one of the best yearning, bittersweet ballads U2 have ever written. I didn't think much of the song when I first heard it, but once I let myself get lost in the Edge's guitar, I was in love.    Speaking of which, \\"Gone\\", with its fuzzed out guitar is, hands down, one of my all time favorite U2 songs (right up there with \\"Bad\\", \\"In God's Country\\", \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Till The End of the World\\", and \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\"). The lyrics are superb, and Bono's delivery is stellar. \\"Mofo\\" is a marvelously eclectic rumble of a song that turns out to be one of Bono's most personal songs (it deals with the loss of his mother).    Elsewhere on \\"Pop\\", \\"Discotheque\\" and \\"Last Night On Earth\\" invite the listener to get up and dance (the former, literally), with terrific results. I haven't danced this much to a U2 album since \\"Achtung Baby\\". \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" features wonderful lyrics and a stunningly seductive delivery by Bono that gives me chills each time I hear it.    Finally, there are the songs that I held in something close to contempt when I first heard this album: \\"Please\\", \\"The Playboy Mansion\\", \\"Miami\\", and \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\". \\"Please\\" is a terrific song, full of yearning, desperation (a common theme throughout Pop) and frustration but it remains a difficult listen because of the intense subject matter and Bono's matching delivery. \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" plays like a bluesy soundtrack to some glitzy Hollywood film (a musical precursor to ATYCLB's \\"In A Little While\\"). At first, I cringed at the inclusion of the bit from \\"You Showed Me\\", but I realized that it fits the laid back tone of the song quite well. Lyrically, the song is a fun poke at popular culture's view of the ideal existence.    \\"Miami\\" used to grate on my nerves like no song in a long time, but the half-sung half-spoken song (backed with a trip-hop beat) about that famous city is actually a unique song worth the listening experience, even if has to grow on you.     \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" underwhelmed me when I first heard it, but further listening revealed some of the Edge and Adam Clayton's best work, as well as the desperate lyrical call for Jesus to appear in the here and now. It proves a fitting end to this ever-questing album.    Like many U2 albums, \\"Pop\\" rewards repeated listenings. It took me 5 years to grasp and appreciate the raw beauty of \\"Achtung Baby\\". It took only a year for me to like, enjoy, and even fall in love with \\"Pop\\". I'd say my U2 learning curve has improved considerably.
B00005OB0A|5.0|I was recently introduced to Kylie's new single in London while visiting on vacation.  Of course Kylie isn't even on the radar scope in the US, but after hearing this album, I can't figure out why.  She is fantastic!  This album is one of the best I have heard in years.  Now I am back in Chicago and I'm starting to hear &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; on the radio here even though it hasn't even been released in the States.  If this album is eventually released in America, watch for it to be a huge smash!  I am definitely a new Kylie fan and I will purchase other Kylie CD's.  I highly recommend this selection if you like dance music at all.
B00003CXXR|5.0|This was such an edge of your seat thriller.You'll never get tired of this movie.With returning cast members Sam Niel and Laura Dern.It is a must have to your collection buy it now don't wait another minute.&quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot;
B00003CXE7|2.0|I cannot seem to get over the fact that Russel Crowe won an Oscar for this!  He swung a sword around for 2 hours, come on!  If you want to see the Best Actor of 2000, i'll refer you to Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls).  Crowe's character reached no emotional level whatsoever.  We saw his wife &amp; kid through 40 seconds of silent flashbacks, tell me why we should sympathize with his grieving??  Well photographed, well choreographed, but the rest--Craptacular.
B000002I2I|5.0|What made me listen to this album was over-hearing 'Peace Frog' from a friend's walkman. All i heard was the opeing few chords of the lead guitar, the bass kicking in, and I was hooked. Though this esentially a blues/rock album, I never felt over-powered by that fact and felt this a very easy to listen to album. A lot of The Doors tracks are known for their twisting, poetic lyrics, however on songs like 'Indian Summer' I'm immediately struck by the Doors ability to make a simple love tribute seem so beautiful. In a sentance: It's so simple it's geneus. I don't have an overly extensive album collection, but this is the only album I could listen to over and over and over again and sing along to every word.  Two themes seem to re-occur - Morrison's loathe of his father, and his troubled yet un-wavering love for Pamela Courson. Sheer class.
B00004Z459|5.0|I am not your typical hip listener of the latest bands. I usually hover in the classical and new age sections listening to much more sedate music but Linkin Park drew me in with the powerful Crawling. I took a chance and bought the CD and have to say that it has been a staple in my CD player for several months now. Highly Recommended!
B000058T5E|5.0|I saw him perform this live, he was awesome.  The energy was the same as the album, which I must confess gets me going.  Everytime I listen to a Jeff Beck album, I put down my guitar.  I just can't keep up.  He is a distinctive guitarist that has a very different style.<br />I recommend this CD wholeheartedly.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|These guys are absolutley incredible. The cd is absolutely hilarious, and on top of that the music is really good. You have guys out there like adam sandler who are hilarious but don't have great music. Tenacious D writes incredible songs and the content of their cd is hilarious at the same time. I highly reccomend this cd to anyone and everyone.
0060278234|5.0|Just like my title, I thought this book was only semi-perfect because...THEY LEFT ME HANGIN'! I guess it's a good way to get you to buy the next book. But besides that I thought it was a very good book. Garth Nix is a very good writer and I can't wait for Abhorsen to come out. His detail makes you feel as if you really are in the book. The Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre creates a perfect world for Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen to be in.
0783230710|5.0|1995's &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (directed by Ron Howard) is an immensely-entertaining, mega-detailed true-life story of the near-disastrous April 1970 Apollo moon launch!<br />Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon star as the 3 men bound for the lunar surface, until an explosion aboard the spacecraft alters their plans.  The attention to detail in this picture is staggering.  Howard and company didn't miss a beat when re-creating these events and their surroundings!<br />There's a fine music score to accompany the action on screen as well.  And it's nice to have this one on DVD, for the wealth of supplemental materials, as well as a fantastic Dolby 5.1 audio track!  (Crank up the volume for the Apollo launch sequence!  It sounds awesome in all its 5.1 window-shattering splendor!)
0064471837|5.0|I admit it kinda started out slow...but it ended with a bang! The book was perfect! I love the characters and the world that Garth Nix has created in Sabriel, it's sequel: Lirael, and the upcoming book Abhorsen. I can think of one word that explains Garth Nix ideas...perfect.
B000002TQV|4.0|I love this album.  Fake plastic trees is my absolute favorite Radiohead song.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Don't listen to these gloomy geeks who say this movie isnt any good just because it has a love story, the love story just adds to the emotional value of this awesome movie, it makes you pround to call yourself an american. The actions sequences are great. You really need to experience this dvd widescreen style on a bigscreen its great. Once again the love story makes you want to cry, its great. with out it the movie wouldnt be the same. dont listen to them its a great movie. check it out. its definately worth the purchase. Also God bless our brave heros overseas and at home. thanks
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a great album!  It's the best of their first 3 albums, and a great turning point for their next two.  Listen to this thing at night with the lights turned off.  <br />You must get this album.
B000002J29|4.0|The success of Genesis after Gabriel's departure must have puzzled the latter, perhaps even rankled him a little.  \\"Seconds Out\\" is a necessary ingredient here in evaluating this success, for most of the material from \\"Trick of the Tail\\" and \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" benefit greatly from the live presentation.  \\"Squonk\\" just about redeems itself here (not sure anything could really help \\"Robbery, Assault &amp; Battery\\" ....)  Fact is, though, some of the grizzled Gabriel-era material comes off in fresh color, as well.<br />\\"Afterglow\\" always struck me as the song John Lennon would have made of \\"Imagine\\" (speaking sonically only) if he had had the resources.  The sound on this live album is much richer and warmer than the studio cut on \\"Wind and Wuthering.\\"<br />The same can be said of \\"Dance on a Volcano,\\" although there is something [I haven't quite put my finger on] that I do like in the studio cut.  Could just be that, while the song does benefit from the timbral enrichment on \\"Seconds Out,\\" the song benefits in other ways from the spare clarity on \\"Trick of the Tail.\\"  Yet, neither version is `incomplete' in any sense.<br />Similarly, \\"Supper's Ready\\" is less `edgy' here, live, than back on \\"Foxtrot.\\"  Some Genesis `purists' may take strong exception to this, but I find I prefer the rendition on \\"Seconds Out.\\"  The excerpt from \\"The Music Box\\" from \\"Nursery Cryme\\" is likewise fuller, and possesses greater urgency than I remember from the studio cut.<br />Contrarily, though, there is something in the `sonic expansion' of \\"Seconds Out\\" which does \\"Firth of Fifth\\" from \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" a modest disservice.  Having said that, though, I think Hackett's guitar does a marvelously creative job of substituting for the absent Gabriel's flute solo in the instrumental heart of \\"Firth\\" ... but the subsequent asymmetrical-meter-arpeggio material suffers on \\"Seconds Out.\\"<br />Of course, a great deal of the best music from \\"Selling England\\" and \\"Trick of the Tail\\" isabsent from the live album, for it would not translate well into a rock-arena show:  Hackett and Banks in their magical chemistry on \\"After the Ordeal\\" and \\"Ripples\\" ... and the Hackett/Rutherford/Banks massed 12-string-guitar-choir on \\"Entangled.\\"<br />There is a manner (as well as a degree) of musicality in this band, which you simply hardly ever hear in a rock group;  in fairness, it is a very different sort of musicality than is required for \\"Twist and Shout\\" ... there is a compositional breadth that they are capable of, at their best, which goes beyond the fact that their harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary easily transcends the rock idiom `around' which they created these songs.
B00003CX5P|2.0|From what I now know from the abomination called The Phantom Menace, Vader's childhood was total (...). He was a \\"Yippee\\" shouting, cornball of a person. He hung around with a cartoonish orange looking frog named Jar Jar, who would annoy the heck out of the normal sane person. No wonder he turned to the Dark Side. If I had to endur Jar Jar's antics for that long, I'd go insane too. Also Anakin/Vader built C-3PO, the droid he happens to be looking for in A New Hope. What was George thinking! Why does every character from the originals have to be added in. I'm suprised I didn't see a little Chewbacca running around. I think C-3PO should have been built somewhere else, or in the background and somehow met the crew later, maybe not in Episode 1. He didn't even hardly speak anyways. He had but two lines, so what does it matter. All we get from it was another corny connection. When I now look at Vader, I don't seem to feel as threatened or him being as feared as before when I think of him saying \\"Yippeee\\" as he runs off from a \\"hard\\" days work. Now to get on some of the real weak points.<br />The acting. Is it too much to ask for decent acting? Star Wars may be better than any other movie out, but at least the other movies have acting in it. They just seem to cardboard and wooden. I mean check out the part where Qui-Gon says, \\"There is a chance many Gungans will be killed\\". He acts likes he's reading off a que card. I never got any real feeling about the characters. And I just have to ask this question. Why is it that Jar Jar and Anakin get more lines than Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul? I know I would have rather heard more about the Jedi vs. Sith relationship and less of Jar Jar's \\"Ex-squeeze me\\" and \\"How rude\\". What is this, Full House? Please George, if you listen at all to the fans, just do something about the weak points from this movie, put the ego aside. If he was so unhappy with the originals that he had to change them 20 years later and want to change them again for DVD, then please say he will change this one. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't like the idea at all that this is the beginning Episode for the saga. I wouldn't want to show this first to someone who has never seen Star Wars. I may be a perfectionist, but I do wish he will come to reality and do better with Episode II, but he HAS to fix this one also.
B00005JKHP|5.0|When I first heard that they were doing a special edition I thought to myself about time because most of the ST films special effects looked terribly outdated.I have always liked the storylines, even though the Next Generation ones were a bit too dramatical and far too serious they were excellent in thier own way.<br />The motion picture which holds good memories with me for a longtime,I thought would end up looking like Star Wars special edition.However it ended up looking the same and the additional footage is  nothing much to brag about,I'd wish they used the money for those new scenes on the old ones to perfect them.<br />I feel cheated !The films opening scene with the Klingon ships are so evident of poor quality  special effects it hurts my feelings,and the Spoks' chase into the V'ger also looks bad.What a waste but the marketing campain deserve to work with Richard Donner who also made his classic Superman DVD movie with just additonal scenes and digital sound did nothing to improve the image quality of the movie.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I think George made Watto a little like himself.<BR>&quot;Great storyline, superb acting, tastefull humor, and delightful characters don't work on me....only money!&quot;
B00000IAU3|5.0|Sure her music's calm, some classify it as \\"boring\\", but if you'd actually sit down and listen to the lyrics I garentee you anyone will be amazed!<BR>First off I hate rap, I never listened to Eminem and pray I'll never have to, so naturally I never even knew she did backup singing or whatever she did do with Eminem. I heard \\"Thank You\\" and just loved it! It's so calming and soothing to listen to and the lyrics are amazing! She wrote all of them, so all of them have their own unique sound unlike some clones (...). <BR>So in conclusion:<BR>1.) ...<BR>2.) This is a good buy if you like her style (why you'd even buy it after listening to the clips and knowing her singles and hating them and then going \\"Hum, I duh think I'll buy that CD I'm sure I'll hate\\" is beyond me).<BR>3.) I hope she never turns to rap.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I'd heard this movie put down so much that I opted to not see it in the theater. I will admit that Bruckheimer films have a tendency toward prefabricated robotic scripts and melodramatic direction and acting; however, despite the consensus of the other reviewers, this film strays as far from those faults as it possibly can.<br />To begin, I find it quite amusing that no one giving this film an unkind review is able to give specific details of melodrama or clich&eacute;d plot or any other significant fault. So, to avoid that lack of credibility, I am going to actually explain why this movie is good:<br />It seems fairly taken for granted that the special effects and action sequences are of superior quality, and such minor facets of film as a whole are rather inconsequential, so I'll skip that category. So, what about the plot/screenplay: Let's start with the friendship of the two lead characters. Due to surprisingly authentic acting (accents included), the relationship between Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett's characters is immediately convincing and intriguing. They are country boys, who dream away their childhoods and aspire always for honor and courage. They love each other in a way that is never displayed in American cinema, unless it involves homosexuality.<br />Then we have the extremely sweet, innocent, and humorous romance between Ben and Kate Beckinsale's characters. Despite the commonly held notion, this is not in any way akin to Leo and Kate Winslet's relationship nor characters from Titanic. That film portrayed the old-as-time tale of a girl, who is, against her will, engaged to a man, whom she doesn't love. Those characters knew each other for like a day before they were gettin' their groove on and professing their undying love for each other. Can you say &quot;absurd&quot;? Anyway, the romance in Pearl Harbor does not come anywhere near the ridiculously overdone and unconvincing romance in Titanic. Rather, Michael Bay's superb direction-including cinematography (very dark backgrounds with bright lights on the eyes of the actors), angles (ecu's at pivotal and spiritual moments), editing (fast cuts and slight disorientation to express the &quot;butterflies in the stomach&quot; sense of confusion that love induces), direction of acting (the sense of puppy-love is enhanced by the stumbling and stuttering of both characters), and production values (did you see the sets?)-really makes the viewer feel like a part of the relationship. He also puts a different feel on the relationship by refraining from resorting to sex to solidify their love for each other. For this, I say, &quot;God Bless Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Randall Wallace.&quot;<br />As far as historical accuracy or whatever is concerned, if you care that much about such things, GO TO COLLEGE, READ AN HISTORICAL JOURNAL, WATCH THE HISTORY CHANNEL, TRAVEL BACK IN TIME; don't ever-EVER go see a movie expecting historical accuracy. Although a few--very few--may be &quot;historically accurate,&quot; they can't all be for the simple fact that that is already taken care of by educators, documentary filmmakers, et cetera. You might as well be complaining that the film didn't have enough of Santa's reindeer to please you.<br />On the subject of mental, moral, emotional, or political dilemmas: IT'S A MOVIE-ENTERTAINMENT, ESCAPISM, FUN, ROMANCE, LAUGHS, TEARS, et cetera; it never claimed to be and certainly shouldn't be a commentary on or an exploration of such weighty issues. It's simply a patriotic, exciting, and well-made love story, nothing more, and nothing less. Similarly to the last topic I dealt with, if you want significant dilemmas and character studies or whatever, watch a Merchant/Ivory film, read the Bible, read C.S. Lewis, go to Harvard Divinity School, just don't watch a big-budget American film with Alec Baldwin, Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Dan Aykroyd, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, et cetera. You don't see people attending a Lakers' game expecting to see Peyton Manning bowl a hole-in-one, throw a grand slam, and then fall off of his horse.<br />How could anyone dispute the eye and heart that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer share when it comes to filmmaking? The film is beautifully shot with low-lying angles, epic camera movements, appropriate distortions of the camera lens and film, gorgeous actors/actresses, lighting that rivals that of Thierry Arbogast, universally emotional music, characters that are developed enough to fall in love with, yet reticent enough to picture oneself in their shoes, and a factual event that changed the course of world history.<br />Most people who don't like this film though probably cheered when Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, and Gladiator won Academy Awards, and they probably all hail Citizen Kane and Metropolis as the greatest films of all time, so that should be incentive to simply ignore them all.ee Peyton Manning bowl a hole-in-one, throw a grand slam, and then fall off of his horse.<br />How could anyone dispute the eye and heart that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer share when it comes to filmmaking?

B00005RFQ5|3.0|I enjoy good music and this CD does it for me.  I admit the religon thing gets a little old, but the music allows me to get past that.  The deep voice thing does have to go, but overall its worth buying.<br />~Liv 4 Luv~
B000002UAR|5.0|...After George's recent passing,probably many aging Boomers (like me) have been reexploring old vinyls from the days of our youth.And &quot;Revolver&quot; is always worth listening to, whether you're 15 or 50.George has three tunes here,all of them different,none of them essential though. &quot;Taxman&quot; seems like a right wing Tory tirade,and the melody and blasting fuzz tone guitar are enough to make anyone run for the exit. But hold tight!! Interestingly, it shows that at the time (George was about 25),even though he may have been seeking wisdom,enlightenment,and inner peace, he was not above ranting on about taxes...But the rest of the album is ALMOST ALL AMONG THE BEST FROM ANY ERA.And, EVERY SINGLE SONG IS DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE.  &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; seems like George's version of &quot;Day Tripper&quot;,but &quot;Love You Too&quot;, is splendid and he scores a hole in one with the new (to the western world) sitar sound, and semi-transcendental lyrics.The real contribution is from Paul,whose every number here shows why he is most assuredly the MOST TALENTED musician and songwriter of the rock era.&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; has always been a wondrous one of a kind comment on what seem to be lonely lives that many of us may never escape from.&quot;Here,there,and Everywhere&quot; is still a lovely,almost perfect ballad.One wishes perhaps that the overbearing guitar chord lines were replaced by strings. &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; is a wonderful Gilbert and Sullivan-sounding quasi-Barber Shop Quartet joy from beginning to end with  a bouncy piano underscoring the fun.&quot;For No One&quot; again shows Paul singing haunting and sad lyrics in a much underrated Beatle special,and &quot;Got To Get You in My Life&quot; is a rousing hip-hip-hooray with a band that could do Sammy Davis,Jr. proud!..John's contribution here is a little problemic.&quot;She Said..&quot; with lyrics like &quot;I know what it's like to be dead&quot;..&quot;And you're making me feel like I've never been born&quot;, were probably plucked from a Tibetan or Hindu poem,and seem a little angry here.&quot;Tomorrow&quot;,always among the Beatles' strangest songs, I think may be based on an eastern chant.Interesting,and a real contrast with Paul's zest and fun. Even Ringo is perfect for the seaside chanty &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; as the gang does a great imitation of tipsy sailors.The other three cuts were originally from a US album &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;,and are of interest,though frankly,Dr. Robert for me has always been practically unlistenable,and still is...Better than any other Beatles' effort,this one shows the unique contributions of each member of the fab four,especially as they developed beyond the youth market.
1881273156|4.0|This is a good book for anyone who is trying to improve their marriage. I recommend this book and &quot;His Needs, Her Needs,&quot; by Harley, as good starting places for marriage enrichment through books. Granted this book provides an over-simplified version of love and relationships, but that doesn't make it bad. In fact, the simplicity of this book is part of what makes it such a great place to start. Understand the basics first and then move to the more complex issues. When you are ready for that I recommend &quot;The Passionate Marriage&quot; by Schnarch.
B00004XQ83|4.0|I really liked some of the bluegrass songs on this CD, Alison Krauss was great on two of hers, but didn't much care for the blues sound a couple of tunes had. I did think it was strange that there are four versions of &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot;, all of different lengths, two of them instrumentals, but I think that I like the second Soggy Bottom Boys version (#16) the best.<BR>#1 Po Lazarus, was recorded in a prison farm (I think)in 1959, it sounds like the microphone was in the wrong place (too close to the sound effects)#2 Big Rock Candy Mountain, was recorded in 1928, clear as could be. #19 Angel Band, was done in 1955, it's bluegrass, not bad either.
B00003CXWV|3.0|I'm impressed with Infinifilm's presentation style in their DVD efforts.  I really loved 13 Days (see a prior review), and if there is one thing worthy of notice in &quot;Blow&quot;, it is the presentation, technical style and DVD extras.  No attempt is made in the actual film to explore the horrors of cocaine, but the two<br />documentaries make it clear how the 70's drug of choice has devastated the culture and society of Colombia, along with the lives of many.  Ted Demme, a fine director, explores what scenes were left on the cutting room floor in an entertaining piece, and the real George Jung gives a film interview that makes the &quot;goings on&quot; in Blow seem a little closer to reality.<br />That said, the film was a disappointment to me - well filmed, with no seeming point or passion.  I felt that Johnny Depp was<br />believable and totally in character for the role, and perhaps he<br />and Demme meant to have him exhibit little or no passion or chemistry with the central women in his life, his mother, his wife, his daughter.  He's believable in the youth scenes and the drug trafficking scenes, in prison....but seeing him try to make us believe that his daughter is the central focus of his life...well, it just didn't feel that way on the screen.<br />Ray Liotta is miscast and subdued as Jungs' dad, and, with every passing flick I grow more and more disenchanted with Penelope Cruz, who just seems to show up on the screen, emote a little, and hurry to get back to her film trailer.  Capt. Corelli was disastrous, she is strident and unattractive in Blow, and, intuition tells me that Vanilla Sky will fall on its face.<br />So, you take a bit of pop culture, add an incredibly talented leading man and director with little support from the other cast, and perhaps not enough of a tale to tell, and you get &quot;Blow&quot;.<br />Not a favorite of mine.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie's career has had extreme highs and lows but the last few albums have seen her come into her own as a formidable musical force.  Both Fever and Light Years have received amazing success and rightly so.  Can't Get You Out Of My Head has been a hit single in all European countries, except one, plus in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.  The song is simple and yet a shinning example of Kylie's new found musical maturity.  <br />Fever as a whole is an upbeat exciting album.  The next single, In Your Eyes, is a personal favourite and pulls refference from her previous album's huge hit, Spinning Around.  Fever is another track that stands out among this collection of top material.  Burning Up finishes this album superbly with a mix of cool sultry vocals and bouncy retro disco.<br />Kylie, as a performer, is outstanding always trying to come up with shows and music designed to thrill and excite, on this album she succeeds yet again.
B000002Q88|5.0|I'm a huge Kansas fan--from the first album to Song For America thru Point of Know Return &amp; Leftoverture.  My favorite Kansas songs ever are Song For America, The Wall, and Journey From Mariabronn, so I know what I'm saying when I discuss their old stuff.  However, Steve Morse has always been my favorite guitarist, and when he joined Kansas, it was truly a match made in heaven.  Steve is from the great instrumental band, The (Dixie) Dregs, and fit perfectly into the Kansas sound, as both they and the Dregs used violin and keyboard textures extensively.<br />There is, however, an unfortunate side to Morse's joining the band: the loss of primary songwriter, Kerry Livgren.  Still, somehow on this album, the band managed to retain a bit of the old sound while writing some great songs.  Ghosts, House on Fire, Rainmaker, and The Bells of St. James are excellent. Also, if you can listen to Morse's passionate guitar solo on the beautiful Ghosts or his fiery solo on Bells of St. James and be unmoved by them, you're either not human or you know nothing about music.  Steve Walsh's pipes are (as usual) in good form throughout this disc as well.  This album will go out of print soon, so snatch it up, especially at this price!
0375703764|5.0|Just flipping through the pages of this novel could give you a headache, but it's one of the most intriguing books to come out in the last few years, maybe the decade.<br />The book is presented as a work written by a fictional blind man named Zapano who dies and leaves behind this tome, which is in turn edited and researched by a pretty weird cat who lives in his building, who in turn has the book published.  What's this merry-go-round book about?  It's a factual study of the phenomenon concerning the release of a home video by a noted photographer which shows that the house he and his family has moved into is strangely larger on the inside than it is on the outside.  When doors and hallways start appearing in the house out of nowhere that lead to impossibly large and creepy places, the fun really begins and the true power of the book starts to reveal itself: its a damn creepy read.  So creepy and surreal that it has you checking your own closets and doors, I'm not kidding.<br />The audacity of the author is apparant in a mere flipping of the pages: there are footnotes to passages that go on for pages, some research, but some mere personal musings and stories by the editor.  There are pages written sideways.  There are pages with one word on them.  Everywhere the word &quot;house&quot; appears it is printed in blue ink.  There are letters in the back written by the institutionalized mother of the original editor.<br />In other words, it ain't no weekend book.<br />I'm not going to lie to you: I don't even get it all.  As it turns out, you need to bone up on your Norse mythology a little bit to get all of the author's meanings, but I didn't and still got a hell of a charge from it.  I was able to superimpose what I thought was going on and it made it even more personal and creepy for me.  This book is like &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; written by Albert Einstein.<br />Not for the faint of intelligence.
B00003CXXR|4.0|Well I was dying to see this next Jurassic park movie.  I did not know at the time they were going to introduce a new dinosaur.  I think that they rushed this movie along.  The fact that the spinosaures kills a t-rex is way out of line.  I studyed dino's for years and the spionsarues could only kill and eat FISH defesless little fish.  and the fact that they completly blow aside the t-rex made me mad too.  they also need to stop focus ing on the raptors for gods sake there only in the movie every minute of the film.  and if this was on the 2nd island then why did the second film not include the spionsaus and petrodan.  WOW.  But still the only reson they added the spinosarus is because they wanted a bigger danger.  Watch closely the first film one t-rex two raptors and one diloposaurs (Which really got jipped because the diloposaurs is like the best dino that ever existed) but those were the only dangers in the first film.  the second film out of now were there has to be like 15 raptors 2 t-rex's one t-rex baby and no diloposarus! the 3rd movie NO t-rex NO diloposaurs BUT you got a Spinosaurs ( let me guess the 4th movie will have 2 of them) millions of raptors that look alot different than the first 2 movies and one albertosaurs that just looks at them and then walkis away. And a couple of petrodons.  The film directors got to realize that even  though these movies all had more danger than the last one.  I think many people agree that the first one was the best because it showed more of a variate of dinosaurs.  And I will never get over th fighting scean between the t-rex and spinosaurs.  It is completly fake!!!<BR>    However this movie is still worth watching is has some really cool parts. ( and if you did not know they are makeing a JP4)  So lets all hope that the t-rex earns back his crown and kills the spionsaurs and that there is a diloposarus in there too!
B0000214F0|1.0|\\"You cannot possibly absorb all that there is in this film with one viewing,\\" says Bob Guccione of his magnum opus, CALIGULA.  A pity, then, that the film is such a chore to sit through even once. Despite its clear aim to shock and offend, CALIGULA manages only to be an interminable bore.  It is, in a way, the Andrew \\"Dice\\" Clay of films.    Helen Mirren (one of several what-the-hell-are-YOU-doing-here members of the cast) once commented on the film's \\"irresistible mixture of art and genitals.\\"  The genitals are there, all right, but there is very little art on display, save perhaps a few nicely designed sets.  As for irresistible... The acting ranges from passable to atrocious, the script has no idea where it is going or what it is trying to say, and virtually nothing in the film has any dramatic impact whatsoever. It is impossible, furthermore, to give a damn about any of the characters, apart from Caligula's sister, Drusilla. In this role, Teresa Ann Savoy actually acquits herself fairly well, and manages to escape with more of her dignity intact than anyone else in the cast.    Maybe these aspects of the film are not what interests you.  Know, then, that even as a \\"guilty pleasure,\\" the film is astonishingly unentertaining.  In their quest for notoriety, the filmmakers have crammed nearly every frame full of depravity of one sort or another.  It is difficult to imagine a non-porn film with more nudity and sex in it, but nearly all of this footage is unpleasant.  Apart from the \\"not-bad hardcore footage\\" to which Leonard Maltin refers, there's nothing even remotely titillating, let alone erotic, in the entire film.  As for the notorious graphic violence, this has not aged well.  It's still unpleasant enough, but rather than shock, it tends simply to embarrass.  And then, just when you think the film has hit rock bottom, Malcom McDowell crams his fist up somebody's (butt)...  Waiter? Check please.    The DVD features the sorriest excuse for a 'restored version' Ihave ever seen.  The image is grainy and occasionally ill-focused, and the sound ranges from good to lousy.  The one bright spot (and, really, the only reason to check out this DVD at all) is a perversely fascinating documentary entitled THE MAKING OF \\"GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA\\".  This hour-long, poorly-filmed feature gives ample insight into the laughable pretensions of Guccione et al., and includes most of the film's naughtiest bits besides (God only knows what audience it was intended for).      CALIGULA is a failure on every level.  See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you. If you want porn, get porn; if you want graphic violence, get ROBOCOP. If you want a hammy historical epic, get CLEOPATRA; if you want a good one - well, I'm afraid I can't really help you there. On other hand, if you're still curious, get the DVD, but skip the movie itself and watch the documentary instead. Trust me, you won't be missing anything.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I would certainly agree with the critics that this is one of those movies that asks questions without answering them -- consumerism and the feminization of America are criticized but the alternative, Project Mayhem, isn't much better.  But that really didn't bother me much as I thought the questions themselves were enough to carry the movie.  Basically the idea is that the quest for material possessions in an effort to find happiness is doomed -- a man will only be happy when he's part of a team, hunting, fighting, and overcoming adversity.  <br />The script is hilarious and just about everything is well done.  Great movie.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is a thoroughly enjoyable book.  It defines very simply and clearly the possibility of transformation for human beings and lays out a simple course of action to bring about transformation. <BR>To varying degrees, we all grow up to accept the agreements of our society about the way the world is and how we are.  Some of those agreements are erroneous and cause us pain.  In order to be free of the pain, discover who we are and live a life of self-expression, we need to learn to choose agreements that support us.   Mr. Ruiz presents the 4 agreements that are key to bringing about transformation.  His presentation is gentle, powerful and encouraging.  His message is clear: It is within our reach if we want it badly enough.<br />If you are interested in transformation I suggest that you also read the wonderful book by Ariel and Shya Kane \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\".  This book can be read as a perfect complement to The Four Agreements as it develops other principles of transformation that are not developed in Mr. Ruiz' book and also emphasizes the concept of AWARENESS as the key to transformation. <br />Both books are a must read.  They have had a big impact on my life and I keep them handy as powerful reminders that life doesn't have to be painful cross bearing experience that it can, in fact, be magical.
B0000062W7|5.0|This is my favorite record of all time......the deftones capture every possible emotion on this album, and it's nice to know, no matter what's going on, Around the Fur is the answer.  There is pain, frustration, heartbreak, guilt, self rightousness, as well as confusion, love, and joy on this record. Abe's drumming is outstanding, and Chino singing-to-screaming 1-2 punch is the best in music.  If I could only have 1 CD for the rest of my life, Around the Fur would do the job!
6304143184|1.0|I can't belive there are people who like this movie. And my biggest reason of all for giving this 1 star is because of most of the movie, we can hardly see E.T. If you found an alien in your backyard, would you secretly keep him and not tell your parents. That's the hero in this movie does. His name is Elliott (Henry Thomas). One night he finds E.T (voice of Michael Patrick Bilon) in his backyard. At first he tells his family and they don't believe him. But when E.T comes back, Elliott shows his family (except his mother, he shows him to his brothers and sister). I can't even believe this is a children's movie. But I think it should have gotten a PG-13 from the MPAA.<br />There is much better family movies, like Lilo & Stitch, Shrek, Monsters Inc, Ice Age, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, etc
B00005RFVL|5.0|I have to admit i've never been into swing nor even heard it till now but since I'm a big fan of Robbie's I had to buy it because of it's first single from the album &quot;Somethin Stupid&quot; in which he sings the Frank and Nacey Sinatra hit with the amazingly talented Nicole Kidman. So after playing that song a million times I decided to listen to the rest of the album not sure on what to expect, but this album full of covers (excluding the first song on the album which Robbie wrote himself) is marvilous &quot;Somethin Stupid&quot; was no longer on the top of my list but alot of others were simpily devine such as the beautiful &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; and &quot;They can't take that away from me&quot; which Robbie dueted with actor Rupert Evvert and just when I thought the album would end, the simply beautiful &quot;it was a very good year&quot; in which with the marvel of modern technology Robbie was able to sing with his metor and inspierer Frank Sinatra was a wonderful and beautiful song. This is a great album with another familiar song which was on the movie &quot;Bridget Jone's Diary&quot; titled &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones&quot; which actually inspired Robbie to do a whole swing album and I'm sure you'll agree with me as it is now no.1 in New Zealand (for it's 3rd week on it's debut) and Britian (for it's 2nd week on Debut). A must have for all Robbie Fans young and old.
B00003CXRM|5.0|this coen brothers production has all the elements of an excellent movie without the silly trappings of many hollywood productions.  Great music, several very funny scenes with an exceptional cast.. John Turturro is a great actor and this movie continues his body of work.  I can only see this becoming a classic.

0440234743|4.0|Have you ever imagined owning eleven billion dollars? It would probable be pretty nice. That's not the case for Troy Phelan. Troy Phelan \\"the tenth richest man in America\\" owns eleven billion dollars. Troy Phelan is a cruel, hard old man who is on the verge of death. As he puts it, \\"Down to the last day, even the last hour now. I'm an old man, lonely and unloved, sick and hurting and tired of living\\". Troy Phelan's six, rude and greedy, children and his 3 ex-wives, have to suck money from their father over the years. They are now gathered one last time with their father for the final signing of the will. Each greedy heir has always thought that they will inherit some of their father's estate, but their father had other plans.      <br />The hero of this story is a guy by the name of Nate O'Riley. Nate is a troubled young lawyer with a bad past. He has been battling his drug and alcohol addiction, hiding from the IRS and running from his marriage. Nate, just fresh out of rehab, has been asked by his boss and also friend Josh Stanford, to do one last case. Josh, who was Troy Phelans lawyer, and is now handling the Phelan estate, has asked Nate to find the legal inheritor of the will. Nate is sent to the Pantanal to battle the heat, water, savages and to find the richest woman in the world.           <br />John Grisham is well known author of all types of books. His books have lots of action, adventure and reality about life. I personally think that \\"The Testament\\" is one of the best or the best book John Grisham has ever wrote. In rating this book, I would give it 4 stars. If you're looking for an all around good book it has to be \\"The Testament\\".

6303379214|5.0|I saw this in the theater years ago, and thus began my adoration.  (Yikes, has it been 7 years already?!)<br />In the realm of romantic-comedies, &quot;Only You&quot; goes above and beyond the &quot;formula&quot;.  Yes, you get the whirlwind romance, great funny dialogue, and enough surprises to make it hard to guess the ending.  BUT!  You also get so much more:<br />- dreamy Italian settings.  Forget Rick Stevens, I didn't know Venice &amp; Positano could be look so magical and luxurious.  <br />- a supporting cast that nearly steals the show.  Bonnie Hunt and her skill for honest (thus, funny) delivery brings the credibility to the movie.  Her style of speaking is so &quot;real-life&quot;, you forget that the whole movie relies on a shaky premise of the faux psychic and a plastic ouija board.  <br />- and a surprisingly underestimated chemistry between Tomei and Downey.  Case in point: Peter helping Faith dress for her date, and he's walking around her room realizing it may be their last time together. <br />Lots of great comic moments and sheer romance.  I'm sorry more people haven't seen it!
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is truly a fantastic compilation, a cd that all contemporary music lovers should not be without. Madonna is one of those artists that EVERYONE has an opinion about, and it is probably true to say, that most people like at least a couple of her tracks.<br />Most people will know most of the tracks, (see above), and its a perfect record of the last decade in Madonna's musical career.<br />Naturally, not ALL the singles are here (a couple are included on 'Something to Remember', Madonnas ballad collection), but this gives an excellent view of her evolving musical styles.<br />From the house / disco of 'Deeper and Deeper', the raunchy 'Erotica' (Madonnas first foray into electronica - a classic!), the spiritual and acoustic 'Secret', and the Bjork penned and fascinating 'Bedtime Story'.<BR>Madonnas 'Ray of Light' era is covered well, as is her recent 'Music' period. <br />There has been some criticism of the track listing, in particular the inclusion of 'Dont cry for me Argentina'...but without it's inclusion (and it is sung beautifully) then GHV2 would not be an accurate portrayal of the last 10 years.<br />The cd is packaged beautifully... absolutely filled with pictures, and the editorial...3 pages of hysterical comments, proving that Madonna has a great sense of humour, and can laugh at herself (though the joke is more on 'the press')<br />My only criticism, is that this cd has offers nothing new for the fans, there are no new tracks, and for ardent followers, no new pictures (though there are nearly 600 pictures in the sleeve!!!!)
0440219078|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas lives in a perfect word where everything is under control.

He also sees pain and suffering. He and the Giver make a plan for Jonas to escape, with a certain baby named Gabe...<BR>     <BR>     I reccomend The Giver to anybody. It gives you a good sense of setting. It is good for any age of people. It is a really good book!
B00003CWTH|3.0|Sometimes, it takes a long time to tell a story.<br />It should never have taken over three hours and 15 minutes to tell the stories in Magnolia, compelling as they are.<br />This movie has an amazing cast and is visually rich and engaging. The performances -- even a sleazy character portrayed by Tom Cruise -- can't be topped. Each actor hands in a great turn.  There are so many levels to the lives introduced here that for the first two hours, you don't mind the waiting game.  It unfolds like the flower that gives the movie its name.<br />However, as the last hour wears on, I became impatient. Forcing moviegoers to sit in witness to artistic vision for this long is simply arrogant, nothing more and nothing less.

B00005UKE0|5.0|With George's recent passing, I put a recently purchased copy of &quot;ATMP&quot; in my cd player.  It's been there ever since.  I am just floored by the greatness of this music.  The melodies are gorgeous, the harmonies are hauntingly sweet and Phil Spector's wall-of-sound production, while gently criticized by Harrison himself in the remastered liner notes, sounds beatiful and, at times, even majestic.  <BR>Many people have made a point of George's long, painstaking growth as a songwriter after having lived for years in the shadow of his more assured, prolific bandmates Lennon and McCartney.  This album, along with the memorable &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; from &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a great testament to a man who had learned his craft and was ready to share it.   One criticism, which is most likely shared by nearly everyone who has ever purchased this album, are the somewhat rough, rather superfluous jams that close the album.  They seem unnecessary and out of place but, hey, George was probably having lots of fun with his fellow musicians, so who am I to say anything?<BR>Above it all, what keeps impressing itself upon me as I listen are George's simple, contemplative lyrics.  As a person who has strived to be more spiritual in a city where it has become harder and harder to do so, I can't help but be heartened by the hope that emanates from these songs.  George was someone who strived to find the blessedness in everything.  We are very fortunate that he was gracious enough to share his findings with us and to encourage us to find peace, happiness and, of course, God.<BR>Listen and Love.  And so long, George.  We'll miss you.
B0000542D1|5.0|It has been referred to as 'The Citizen Kane of juke box musicals', and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is definitely that...and more!  Rock and roll movies prior to the release of &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; were, in the main, nothing but silly youth exploitation pics (eg. Elvis' post-army offerings and every Cliff Richard vehicle), but AHDN was light years ahead in the genre.  The songs are performed in a variety of backdrops and, viewed separately from the movie, have a music video feel to them, some twelve years or so before music videos became commonplace.  The dialogue is at times, witty, sarcastic, or downright poignant.  The storyline is not at all complicated, and for anyone who wants to know what Beatlemania was all about, this picture has an almost documentary feel to it, which is further deepened by the use of black and white.  Even though some of the dry British wit may go over the heads of some Americans, AHDN still comes off as being fresh and cheeky, and will therefore remain a classic.  Will the same thing be said of 'The Spice Girls Movie' when it's 38th birthday rolls around?  Somehow, I doubt it...
B00005OC06|3.0|The singing is very good and the Dolby 5.0 sound track is excellent. However, the performance, stage design and lighting are not as good as in another movie from Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, Verdi's &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. I'd rather turn the TV off or watch the weather network while playing the sound tracks on this DVD, just because of the artificial acting, fake smiling and the make-up of Freni. I am expecting another Madama Butterfly on DVD from Columbia TriStar with Ying Huang singing Cio-cio-san, although her voice was not as amazing as Freni's.
0679721037|5.0|this book lays it on the line - the horror of what the atomic bomb was like from the perspective of several different residents of hiroshima...who were there on august 6, 1945.  it's a clear, well-written (though DRY) account of that horrible day, and if there's any book that's going to make you against nuclear weapons this is it.<br />what shocks me is that people (some who even read this book!) still think dropping this bomb (not to mention the one on nagasaki) was worth it.  granted, there can be a million arguments justifying it, about how it saved lives, and how the japanese committed horrible atrocities too, etc., but just seeing the pure horror this bomb inflicted (through the eyes of these characters) is enough to make me say &quot;no way - going to this degree of horror cannot be justified.&quot;<br />and to all you who still want to argue that dropping this bomb had its merits...and that creating even more destructive nuclear bombs has its merits...well...well...i feel sorry for you.  because horror is horror, and when it comes to weapons of mass destruction we are all innocent.  no one deserves that.
8478884955|5.0|Esta novela me esta gustando aun mejor que la primera.  !Que divertida es!<br />The translators and publisher are Spanish.  There is much vocabulary from Spain, just as the English version has much British vocabulary.  I really enjoy learning about regional vocabulary differences, whether in English or Spanish, so this was a big plus.<br />A friend claims the American editions have been Americanized, although I don't know if it's true.  (The American editions still have many British words, but do use some American words, like &quot;sweater&quot; instead of &quot;jumper&quot;.)  It's funny how the Brits understand us from seeing our movies/television, but we don't understand their vocab or accent as well.  It's great to be exposed to different forms of languages we already know.<br />The translation seems very good, but some things seem wrong, such as &quot;?QUE TE TENGO DICHO?&quot; on the second page of text.  I think this should be &quot;?QUE TE HE DICHO?&quot;  Maybe this is a form with which I'm not familiar, because I can't imagine a native speaker and translator would make such a gringo (&quot;guiri&quot; en Espana) mistake.
B00005RFAI|2.0|Pink is one of the few female stars in music today without blonde hair extensions and a doe-eyed stare, so I took a chance on Missundaztood after loving the &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; video -- but what a let-down.  Aside from a few stand-outs (&quot; . . Party&quot; &quot;18 Wheeler,&quot; &quot;Respect&quot;) the album is a juvenile, pathetic attempt at channeling the same tired emotions from Alanis Morrissette and other Angry Young Women.  Pink thinks her family is dysfunctional and boys are mean -- and that's about as deep as it gets.  Even &quot;Numb,&quot; a truly original and melodically complicated tune, has the same dumbed-down lyrics as the rest of the ballads.  Nothing more than what I used to scrawl on the back of my notebooks in 7th grade.  To make matters worse, the last half of the album is in the same, excruciatingly slow tempo, and the inanity of &quot;My Vietnam&quot; doesn't even warrant discussion.  I believe there is hope since Pink does co-write most of the songs on Missundaztood.  Maybe she will grow up a little in the next few years and give us some worthier tunes.

Can they disappoint their friends and not toss their annual Christmas Eve bash?<br />Grisham does turn a bit sappy at the end, but I loved the beauty of Luther's final scene with the Scheels and his satisfaction in delivering the perfect gift.<br />This is a witty, clever, fast-paced read that made me laugh out loud in many parts.  It has &quot;made for TV movie&quot; written all over it and if it provides half the smiles the book did, it will be a success.
0761536434|5.0|Don't bother looking around.  Kent has everything you want to know.  I read this book cover to cover and every time I put it down, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  After you read about Nolan Bushnell creating Atari, you want to be Nolan Bushnell and I think this isn't because Bushnell is so great, but rather Kent makes you WISH you were him because what Kent writes about it so consuming.  Buy this book.  Don't shop around.  Buy it now.
B00003CXTF|1.0|Is there a great movie to be told about one of the most fateful days in American history?  Absolutely.  Is this it?  Far from it!  To begin with, a movie called Pearl Harbor should feel some obligation to concentrate on the events of December 7, 1941.  Instead, the movie serves up a ridiculous and uninteresting love story for most of the movie.  In the skillful hands of a director such as James Cameron (as in Titanic), the ploy of using a smaller love story to bring us into the larger story of history can work; in Michael Bay's hands, it fails utterly.  Only during the actual bombing sequence does the movie shine at all, and for a brief moment we see what the movie COULD have been.  Sadly, the best parts of this sequence are ripped off lock, stock and barrel from Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, almost shot for shot (Mr. Bay, you should be ashamed--but then again, you should have retired following the atrocity that was Armageddon).  Low point in the movie:  when Hartnett's character, as the bombs begin to fall around him, calls the airstrip and announces &quot;I think World War II just started!&quot;  Oh, I guess nothing at all had been going on in Europe since 1939--duh.  If you absolutely feel you MUST see this because Ben, Josh, and/or Kate are in it, then do yourself a favor--rent it on DVD, go to chapter select, and just watch the battle sequence.  This is three hours of your life you will never get back otherwise.
B00005JKES|1.0|I loved &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; when it originally aired, and when I heard its first season was going to be released on DVD, the collection shot to the top of my &quot;must have&quot; list.<br />Well, I own it now. And the transfers are gorgeous. The DTS 5.1 encoding gives the show an aural richness never before present. And the show's quirky pacing and obsessive touches have aged much better than one might anticipate, having since been often imitated in lesser venues.<br />That said, I cannot recommend this set, because it is deceptively marketed to an unsuspecting audience. If it were the entire first season, why would the episode labeled as the first in the set have a &quot;Previously on 'Twin Peaks' bumper?&quot; That's right, kids, the pilot episode is not in this set. And nothing on the packaging would lead you to believe that it isn't. I might understand a decision to package and sell it separately, but the pilot is altogether unavailable on DVD in the U.S. <br />Seeing the bumper and the opening credits of the &quot;first&quot; episode made me ache for that beautiful premiere in digital video and DTS sound, with its hypnotic opening credits sequence in the sawmill, and the sad horror that permeates the community as people discover Laura Palmer is dead. Ten years ago, the big question was &quot;Who killed Laura Palmer?&quot; Now, I want to know the name of the person responsible for this fraudulent omission and have that person send out a supplemental DVD to everybody who buys this collection under the false impression that it includes every episode of this series' masterful first season.
6304076517|5.0|. . . why one of the most brilliant films of all time isn't on a DVD?  Some kind of rights dispute or what?
B00000J7JO|5.0|Though not much of a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, I must say this album is great.  I don't know that much about thier music, but I really like this album.  My favorite tracks off of it are &quot;Other Side&quot;, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, and &quot;Californication&quot;.  The other songs are good, but those three are the best.
B00005LOUP|4.0|Advantages: An expensive remake to the original, pretty props, learning more about the fairy-tale Whoville<BR>Disadvantages: Goes astray from the book, Cindy Lou Who is considered as an older, only child in this rehash<br />Universal did a fairly nice job at re-making this high-budget classic: expensive props, visuals, and sound effects.  Unfortunately, ortions of the acting and storyline seem mediocre, and this film isn't nearly as close to the original.  But hey, how can the originals be outshined anyway?<br />This film is far better than most other PG-rated films, and it wouldn't hurt to add this to your Christmas collection.  It's supposed to be funnier than the cartoon, with the aid of Jim Carrey.  It makes a true classic, and is very heart-warming, especially at the end.  <br />Great, but could've been a lot better for a 100-minute film.
B000006045|5.0|The only thing I dont like about this album is that I wasnt part of it.  From start to finish this album explores the mind and like the artists name is a massive attack on your subconsiousness.  The more tripped out it is the better and this rates as my second most tripped out album of all time.  This one is great to listen to in the lexus on the way back from a digital bush walk.  When Liz Fraser sings, I see angels floating throughout the green milky way and when she doesnt, Im still out there with the deep bass, trippy beats and heavenly synth work.  I will be surprised but delighted if this trio can beat this effort on there forthcoming piece.  Even if it compares to Blue Lines and Protection its going to rate a 5.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie has surpassed herself.  I can not stop listening to this CD 24/7.  She has given her fans an all dance CD ala Cher and Gloria Estafan marking her greatest artistic achievement, and she has put out impressive CDs in the past.  Do yourself a favor a put this CD in your player, you will NEVER want to take it out.  I can't even choose a favorite song, because it just depends on my mood.  This CD deserves to be HUGE.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I've been looking for 2 years for an album with as many great pop songs as John Mayer packed onto this CD. The Amazon.com reviewer has it all wrong again... John's lyrics are clever, and reminiscent of Dave Matthews. He is a very accomplished guitarist, although his guitar playing can be better appreciated by downloading some of the his live performances from his web site...<br />Great Great Great pop songs... I can't stop listening to this CD! Any idea when he will be in Minneapolis?
B00003CXPD|4.0|The film does not give adequate time to develop Billy's growing interest in music, especially dance (ballet) -- apart from a few scenes (i.e. improvising a tune on the piano).  This lack of preparation makes the viewer question whether Billy's interest in ballet is genuine or whether it is an act of rebellion against his coal-miner father.  It is only in the latter half of the film is it made clear that his interests are genuine.  Apart from this one quibble, the film is very well made, capturing the feel of the labor disputes of the 80's in the UK.  <br />Jamie Bell who plays Billy Eliot should be nominated for an Academy award for Best Actor.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Peral Harbor is apparently the first DVD issued with a audio processing for headphones, designed to emulate Dolby 5.1 surround sound. It is one of 4 audio tracks on this dvd. The Dolby headphone works well, adding a great sense of ambience to the sound and a richness to the bass frequencies.  The sound projects behind  as well as somewhat forward. It doesn't sound exactly like a surround sound speaker system but it greatly enhances the movie experience, although doubt that I would like it for regular music.  It should convert many viewers to headphone listening with movies. Sound quality is generally obtained with headphones at a fraction of the price of speakers, so Dolby headphone listening presents a potentially much cheaper approach to good movie sound than investing in a 5 or more channel speaker set-up. (...) <BR>As for the movie itself, it was effective for me, although I can see why some reviewers objected to it's stylistic  quirks, e.g. slow-mo shots, the high contrast look which reminded me of tv commercials and the cliches and lapses in the story.  It was nevertheless, in my opinion better than Titanic, which it somewhat resembles with its weaving of a romantic story around a historical disaster.
0380973642|5.0|If nothing else did, Smoke and Mirrors will break down any prejudice you might have had about Neil Gaiman. He is one of the finest, most innovative English writers of the past few decades, not only in comics, not only in fantasy or horror, but in any medium. Though his stories are usually fantastical, or perhaps strange in nature, most of them are also very real in a much deeper sense, his writing is original and beautiful. This fantastic collection of short stories and poems show the full range of his powerful writing and the development of his style from the early 80s to today, including stories that are not, in any way, fantastical ('The Goldfish Bowl and Other Stories').<br />'Post Modern' is the rather odd label that would probably fit his writing best; a review in 'Cinemascape' called him 'a post modern Brother Grimm', which I think is a wonderful description. Neil's work is post modernism in its finest, most enchanting, the way it should have been. He smashes old mythes and taboos, and the stories are often shocking, possibly offending to some; his treatent of myths like Santa Claus ('Nicholas Was...'), Snow White ('Snow, Glass, Apples') or God ('Murder Mysteries') are extremely bold, and never what you would expect. He walks on the edge of pornography ('Tastings'); but he rarely misses his point. The stories are sharp, powerful, with a great sense of irony and social insight.<br />Smoke and Mirrors has something for most readers; some stories, like 'Shaggoth's Old Peculiar' and 'Chivalry', would probably be enjoyed by all, some may be more difficult. But while the stories are often very subtle and sophisticated, they are also painfuly crystal clear. 'Babycakes', one of my favorites, is one of many in the collection that are shockingly effective. Even if you're not a big fantasy fan, read Smoke and Mirrors and get to know an author who is one of a kind.
014028902X|5.0|This and the sequel &quot;Birds, Beasts and Relatives&quot; are among my all-time favorite books.  Recently a friend of mine declined to read the latter book in Fontana paperback because the type was too small but it looks like this new edition is a little easier to read. These books would be better still if they were accompanied by photographs of Corfu and of Gerald's animals, so its probably a good idea to read these while also stealing a glance at a photobook of the Greek islands.
B00000JCB2|1.0|I guess Korn's \\"Follow the Leader\\" can technically be credited as the beginning of the end, this is where mainstream music really hit rock bottom.  \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all\\" was bad anyway, but this is where Limp Bizkit really proved to the world how horrible music really can get.  Try as I might, I cannot for the life of me figure out how anyone can possibly like this.  Seriously, these guys make Linkin Park look like musical geniuses (no easy task).  Wes Borland barely uses one chord, and sounds like he's never seen a guitar in his life, John Otto sounds like a kid on his third day of drum lessons (if even that), and Fred Durst is easily the most irritating vocalist I've ever heard in my life.  The bassist is probably the only member who might have any talent, but he's still not that good.  So, the music is beyond simple, and nowhere near interesting or good.  Okay, it doesn't measure up in the metal world, so let's look at it from a rap standpoint.  The beats are not at all rhythmic or catchy, and Fred has no skill as a rapper whatsoever.  I don't care much for rapping anyway, but compare Fred to someone like LL Cool J. or Ja Rule, and you'll see just how bad he is.  One could argue it's because he's white, but man, even Vanilla Ice is better than that!  Besides that, Fred is one of the most immature, dispicable human beings on the planet, and his lyrics reflect that.  He claims he's changed after Sept. 11, but only time will tell.  Somehow, I have my doubts.<br />Really, I can't imagine why anyone would like this.  Even if you were really into nu-metal, I still don't see it.  This album is beyond horrible, and \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" is even worse.  \\"Rearranged\\" might be good if it were redone by someone else, but probably not.  Over this, I would recommend, well...just about anything!  Go listen to Machine Head or Faith No More, to hear how metal is done.  I can only pray that Wes's departure and Fred's alleged change of heart have brought this reign of terror to an end.an end.
B00004XQ83|4.0|I saw the movie, and went apey!  Incredible.  It's the first DVD I purchased, and have watched it about 15 times so far.  Just bought the CD, and keep listening to it.  Being born in Louisiana in 1950, it's almost like adjusting the Wayback Machine and turning it on, when I see the movie, and listen to the music.<br />Set in 1937, many of the mannerisms and speech carried over to the years I grew up in, in the early 1950's.<br />My only complaint about the CD, is that &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; (one of my favorite songs in the movie) is not the recording in the movie, although the rest of the CD appears to be.<br />From the dreamy &quot;what I'm gonna do with my share of the money&quot; scene's background music, &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot;, to the eerie wail of the Siren's Song, &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby&quot;, the music weaves quite a tapestry through the movie.  You can almost imagine ancient sailors being lured to their deaths on the rocky reefs while you strain to hear the supernatural, whispering instrumental melody of the Siren's Song.  I never really cared for Bluegrass, but this is more of a mishmash of old, Depression Era country music (thank God I didn't have to live through those times).<br />Is it possible to wear a CD out? I'm trying to find out the answer to that question, I'm listening to the CD right now....&quot;You gots ta go, to that lonesome valley... yessuh...&quot;
B00003CXE6|2.0|I can't decide if this is more of a rip-off of SPARTACUS or BRAVEHEART. <br />With all the hoopla made over this film I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. The acting is one dimensional, the story is not original (but drawn out and plain boring) and when you watch this film see if you really care about Crowes character. The answer will be NO.<br />I gave it 2 stars because it was mildly entertaining. However NOT oscarworthy!!!<br />Do yourself a favor. For the real story see SPARTACUS instead. Or if you want some real acting look for Paul Newman.
6305014140|5.0|This is by far the best ever.  The animation is great.  The story is even better.  Viewers will pick up new things everytime they watch.  A must have!
B00003CXTF|5.0|Okay so most people said that titanic was a chic flick, and now I hear alot of chics saying this is a guy flick and they aren't interested in seeing it. Let me say this.....this is the one movie that offers, love, action, romance, guns, planes, fights, sex, blood, everything. This movie my husband and I both love. It belongs in your dvd collection. How could you not enjoy such a great, well made, well written, well directed movie. And it doesn't take six hours to get to a very great surprise ending.
B00005ASOI|3.0|I bought the collector's DVD of this movie a few weeks ago and I actually returned it to the place that I bought it that same day! I had heard so much about Dario Argento and how wonderful this movie was, so I didn't hesitate to buy it on DVD, regardless of the price; I was sure that it was worth it. I took it home, watched the entire movie, and was gravely dissapointed. My fiancee was actually asleep by mid-movie! I am a huge fan of Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava. I expected this movie to be all out in the gore department, having heard so much about the dog attack scene and the \\"most violent murder scene ever.\\" To me, it was really lacking in gore, especially because it is so highly ranked on everyone's \\"must see\\" list; right up there with \\"Zombie\\" and \\"The Beyond.\\" Granted, I really did enjoy the razor wire scene. And, I was really impressed with the over all plot and story line. Bottom Line: If you're like me and you love all out guts and gore, do not buy this movie! But if you are more into dramatic story lines, and a \\"Hitchcock\\" style, you'll enjoy this movie!
0790729725|4.0|Scorcese is good.  But most of what he does I find excessive.  &quot;Raging Bull&quot; and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; are two of the most overrated films ever.  The only really outstanding Scorcese movies are &quot;Mean Streets&quot; and &quot;Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.&quot;  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is very entertaining--it's funny, how is it funny, it makes you laugh?--and there are certainly some classic sequences.  But it falls short of being a truly great film because the character of Henry Hill is never fully fleshed out.  He's a device--he provides a foil for Pesci and DeNiro, and his voice-over is the frame of the movie.  But his response to the violence around him is never quite made clear  (as in the scene where Pesci shoots Spider).  The acting is fine, especially Bracco, who is at her best and sexiest here.  I find Scorcese's use of rock and roll music excessive, too--it's too easy to crank up &quot;Monkey Man&quot; as a commentary on Henry's cocaine business.  &quot;Jump in the Fire,&quot; however, does work well in the famous helicopter sequence.  And this is a great movie about the connection between food and crime.  Still, Scorcese's films are too much technique for too little real content, and, in their obsession with technique, emptily portentous  (this trait he shares with Tarantino, whose best movie, &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; is his most restrained).  I don't think Scorcese will ever top &quot;Mean Streets.&quot;
B000000OPU|4.0|Peter Gabriel's album &quot;So&quot; has achieved classic status in some quarters. It has a few songs that are definitely great, some that are good, and one that I don't really care for. One thing is certain-this man has a whole lot of talent. Few people can write songs that seethe with humanity but at the same time are capable of casting their vision upon something greater. An historic example of this talent that springs to mind is the poet John Donne. Peter Gabriel is also a member of this club.<br />There are three songs that I consider as being &quot;great&quot;on this disc: &quot;That Voice Again,&quot; &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Mercy Street.&quot;<br />&quot;That Voice Again&quot; echoes Romans 7:15 where Paul says: &quot;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.&quot; The song is about the struggle within all human relations, the divisions that so dominate our interactions with others and sometimes our own inner selves.<br />&quot;In Your Eyes&quot; speaks of the place where we find our wholeness as beings. Thomas Merton called what Gabriel sings about as &quot;The Hidden Ground of Love,&quot; most folks just call him Jesus. Either way, this song uses some stirring language--filled with allusions and visual imagery--to describe reaching out to the light, heat, and completeness found in this divine center.<br />My favorite song on the disc is &quot;Mercy Street.&quot; Wow...what can I really say other than that this song is an almost perfect thing of beauty. Gabriel's vocals are amazing, the music is introspective, the lyrics help you to share in the journey Gabriel is on.<br />Like Donne, Gabriel writes some songs that I can only describe as &quot;masterpieces of desire&quot; (sometimes lust). &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is a prime example of Gabriel's talent in this area.<br />&quot;Big Time,&quot; &quot;Don't Give Up,&quot; and to some extent &quot;We Do What We're Told&quot; offer critiques of societies and cultures that have become cynical and abusive.<br />&quot;Red Rain&quot; (a pretty decent song in its own right) serves as a good opener to the disc. It draws the listener down into themselves and, at the same time, into the music--allowing for careful focus and free thought.<br />The only song I really don't care for is &quot;This is the Picture.&quot; It is just kind of weird, and compared to the other songs, it is weak.<br />Gabriel worked with some pretty heavy hitters on &quot;So.&quot; It is co-produced by Gabriel and Daniel Lanois (who produced some of U2's greatest albums). David Rhodes (from the Police), Kate Bush, and Youssou N'dour all make appearances here.<br />If you want some great music, look no farther than &quot;So.&quot; I highly recommend this disc.and cultures that have become cynical and abusive.<br />&quot;Red Rain&quot; (a pretty decent song in its own right) serves as a good opener to the disc.

B000006MS3|5.0|This has always been my favourite Kate Bush CD, which is something you'll hardly ever hear people say about The Dreaming.  This CD shows the world something its never seen since: Music in a popular format that is true abstract art.  Kate has successfully combined experimentle poetry and avant garde sound to create an entire dreamscape.  (...) However, this album is only for real musical fiends, people who appreciate the avant garde.  If you just want something to listen to in your car, you don't want The Dreaming.  The Kick Inside is a lot more digestible, you could say, for passive listening.
B00004RFCM|5.0|What else can I say but how can you not love Sex &amp; The City?!  I love this DVD set because it's great to watch with a group of friends, some food, and some cosmopolitans.  Needless to say I guarante that there will at least one episode if not more that you and your friends will be able to relate to.  It's a good pick me up when your down and the characters are out of this world.  I don't have HBO like alot of people so when I rented it for the first time to see what all the fuss was about it didn't take long before I knew.  I have the compelete second season now to and hopefully they will continue to come out with them..or I could just shell out a couple extra bucks and get HBO hahahaha!!
B00005RFQ5|1.0|Having followed Prince since 81', I agree that \\"Rainbow Children\\" is overbearingly religious, even in comparison to his previous work, and way overproduced.  For years, I've hoped P would give up the dialogue interludes and excessive sound effects, a la \\"Gold Experience\\" and \\"0-/-&gt;,\\" and just deal with his music fans in music.  This one is more production than music.  This album takes itself way too seriously, and more importantly, lacks musical substance.  And that's coming from a lifelong Prince fan.  (Sorry P)<br />If you want musical spirituality that will uplift you, try Coltrane's \\"Love Supreme\\" or a million Classical or Gospel CDs.  As for the best of Prince I think it is (in this order): \\"Hits/BSides,\\" \\"Sign O' The Times,\\" \\"Purple Rain,\\" \\"Emancipation\\" and \\"1999.\\"  Good luck!<br />If you still can't resist the urge to buy &quot;The Rainbow Children,&quot; at least borrow it before you buy.  You have been warned!
0316776963|5.0|I honestly thought this was the funniest book that I have ever read.
B000001F7R|4.0|Let me be clear: no matter what everybody says, or wht sales figures prove, I love ON THROUGH THE NIGHT and HIGH N DRY. They are, in my humble opinion, the best Leppard albums. Of course Leppard always targeted the American market (the first album has the tune HELLO AMERICA, for Gods sake!), but they were still rooted firmly in British heavy metal. But came PYROMANIA, the huge sales of records, and the band was doomed (musically) forever, making very competent, but heartless, hair-metal.
B00005TO7C|4.0|Britney can't catch a break from her fans. She can't please all of them, that's a fact, but she can definately entertain them. She is probably the coolest pop star out there. She can give what we want, even if she doesn't really aim for different musical style. The worst thing about this album is probalby its title, 'Britney'. This isn't Britney all the way. This is the thrid album that got released in a record time, with manufactured pop. There'll come a time (hopefully) when Britney is going to an album that'll be for her what 'Ray of Light' was to Madonna, and that album should much more like her. Now, a look into the 14-track album:<br />I'm A Slave 4 U - It's a nice song and something different from Britney has acostumed us to. This song shouldn't have definately have been the first single, because, although it is a very sexy song (not sexy because of the panting in the middle, because of it's instrumentals and way of singing), it's not very catchy and doesn't really make any justice to the album. This probably was an atempt to turn this album into an 'Erotica' (Madonna) or something. Overprotected - Standard pop. Nice, with more deep lyrics. She sings about her lif and she wants, but that somewhat contradicts her 'real' life. She's always surrounded by bodyguards wherever she goes, not because she doesn't want to (she did claim it's awful to give a lot of autograhs at once), but because they have to be with her 24/7. Nice song, but, since this will be the next single (in Europe) this should not have any dance, since it's a statement, not something worthy to dance to. That's probably a misfire.<br />The bonus tracks 'When I Found You' and 'Before The Goodbye' clearkly save the album from going down. The B-Side 'I Run Away' is also one of the best Britney has done and they shloud be stand-out, not stand-ins. If I was Britney's PR, I would definately choose 'Before The Goodbye' as the lead single, since it is different from everything Britney's done (it actuallyhas guitars mixed with eletronic tunes) and amazingly entertaining lyrics. The ballad When I Found You manages to be better then the Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman one, penned by M.Marin, Rami and Dido. Britney has a low profile in that ballad to hide her (somewhat) weak voice, which is not bad, but I wonder what Christina Aguilera would've done with her(probably shout too loud, like she usually does, but if she contained her voice a little, this song might've worked better for her).<br />Anther tracks, like Bombastic Love and Lonely could've replaced 'Don't Go Knockin' On My Door' and 'Can't Make You Love Me' on her last album (Oops!... I Did It Again), respectively, because they both sound like those ones, but are much better. Lonely has a very small acoustic part in the middle that makes the song worthy listening, but then the rap afterwards completely destroys the song. Bombastic Love has a chorus and a beggining to die for. They're very good. The song is like Overprotected: standard pop.<br />The cover this time around isn't all that great. Britney's cover of Joan Jett's I Love Rock And Roll is too tight and it seems that Britney was rushing to end it, since she sings the song really quick. If only there was some guitar interludes in the middle, that would've made all the diference. By this time, I wondered: Gee, is this really what Britney is about ? No, she isn't. Britney is cool, but she somehow lost herself in what she wanted to show us. Another misfire for the album (but not a bad song, just not appropriate in this context) is 'That's Where You Take Me', which sounds like a remix of a ballad, and is pretty convincing. The chorus is great, but the instrumental tune can be rather childish (added to the fact that she actually sings 'la la la la la' in a part of the song).<br />What It's Like To Be Me is a very cool tune. Definately a nice song. But buy the time we really wanna hear the clímax of the song, it ends. It only has 2:50 minutes and it's soooo small.Britney definately is nice and sweet and a real person, but the way this album was produced makes her look more like a product, then the real Britney, since every song seems to be manufactured on some level or desperately trying to please us...
6305014140|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  The graphics are good and they don't hold back.  You really begin to understand the story and the only thing I would have to say is that I wish the fight scenes lasted a little longer and you got to see more of their special powers.  I love that about anime but I am very satisfied with this movie and it fits perfectly in my collection.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Wow...how can I even begin to describe this.  I'll tell you the truth, when I first went to see this movie (Pearl Harbor) in theaters, I was a little dissapointed.  It seemed a little too corny (like someone mentioned).  I mean the dialogue  was past the brink of being terrible.  Plus, it was too long for my taste. However, the scenery and battle scenes were excellent.  Probably the best things in the movie were the battle scenes.  <br />I was a little hesitant on buying this DVD, but my wife begged me to, so I went ahead and bought it.  I figured, hey, she can watch it, I don't have to.  However, I ended up watching it myself (out of curiousity). <br />First of all, let me comment on the DVD itself. Hard work really went into making this DVD enjoyable. For a DVD, Pearl Harbor is put remarkably well. Even the main menu screen is something to be praised. The picture quality was so crisp, I'm thinking it was probably even better than the theatrical showing.  The sound was awesome!!  When the bombings occured, I found myself actually wincing because the sound was SO real! I was there shaking my head in horror at all the realistic attacks. There is a ton of REAL historical footage on this DVD also.  It comes well equipped with 2 disks.  One disk contains the bonus material.  I didn't think I would like it, but when I watched the \\"making of the movie\\", I really came to realize just how much hard work and effort came into making this movie.  I hate to admit it, but I actually feel that Micheal Bay was at least TRYING to be historically accurate with telling the story (...) and re-living that eventful day which we know as Dec. 7th, 1941.<br />All in all, not only did the DVD come with the making of the movie, but also a History channel documentary of the REAL unsung heroes of this war.  I thought that was very interesting.  It was touching to see these real survivors explain what happend in thier own words. Many of them became very emotional getting flash backs to that horrible scene.  I think I've had a change of opinion since our OWN recent attack on the United States on September 11th.  It made me look at this film a bit differently.  In conclusion, I think this movie Pearl Harbor, did what it was basically supposed to do.  Which is make people remember PEARL HARBOR.  It gave people sort of a glimpse into what the attacks may have looked like 60 years ago. (I'm sure the REAL attack was even worse than what we saw in this film.)   In that sense, I think this movie succeeded.<br />Even haters of this movie will most likely find the bonus material very interesting, and even very good.  The movie was actually bearable this time around.  Even the veterans found this movie enjoyable.<br />So, basically my advice, even if you don't buy this DVD, atleast go and rent it.  I think it's well worth it.
0446677450|5.0|This book will make great sense and challenge your views about rich, career, yourself and our lives. But only so if you are mature enough to understand its ideas. And if you just want to be a high-paid person, the book is not for you. But if you don't want to be just rich, but real rich with great enjoyment of freedom, you should keep this book with you all way along.
B000001ELL|4.0|Damn fine KISS album. Still more surprising, it aged very well indeed! They were at their last drops of crativity here, but no doubt its all about the quintenssential KISS sound yet, even with Anton Fig replacing Peter Criss for most of the songs. It seems all the negative critics were aimed at the tune I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU. But that is a generically good rock track, no matter the rotule (disco, rokc, whatever). The gems here are, no doubt, Aces compositions HARD TIMES and SAVE YOUR LOVE and the Stonescover 2000 MAN. Pauls SURE KNOW SOMETHING has a marvelous catchy riff, and Genes X-RAY EYES is also pure KISS. Not damage for their discography with this album.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I'm sad the youngsters of today have absolutely no idea what has come before them. They may be vaugely aware of band names like the Rolling Stones, Ramones, Stooges, Talking Heads, Television, MC5, but don't know much beyond that, and believe Guns n Roses are the grand ol men of rock n roll.<br />What else can explain this curious burst of excitement for a band rehashing rudimentary rock n roll/70's punk music? I mean, taken on its own merits, I do think it's a decent album. And in light of the horrible, horrible (...) passing as rock n roll (I'm loking at you, Blink 182 and Creed) we've been subjected to in recent years, it's certainly a welcome change to the landscape.<br />But, don't let that cloud your thinking that these guys are remarkably talented fellows. The fact they're young, stylish hipsters from NY no doubt casts the illusion their music is as cool as their image. But sadly, this in far from the case.<br />Wake up kids. Get some older relatives, perhaps even...your parents(!) to school you in rock n roll history, and you'll realize the Strokes really aren't anything to get too excited about. And if you're looking for a more current band to get into, try Built to Spill or Modest Mouse.<br />And for all of you heaping praise on these guys and are old enough to know better...shame on you.
0451204530|4.0|Set in the early 1940s and late 1950s, &quot;Zero&quot; has all the characteristics of a movie from that time: spies, war heroes, espionage, and drama. The hero is handsome, brilliant and dashing. His wife is stunning, tall, brilliant and only a little less dashing. The book jumps back and forth between the time the collection of key characters meet at Harvard in 1941 and the same set converge again at the time of the first American space launch in 1958.<br />In between, there are wars to be fought, affairs to ignite, and traitors to flush out. The basic premise of a man finding himself dirty and without memory, struggling to regain his own sense of self is an old story line. Yet it sets off a plausible and generally entertaining and exciting chain of events.<br />In his typical fashion, Follett does a good job of drawing the reder into his story, cliches and all. Books such as these, unless there is a compelling story, should be set aside very quickly or not read at all. Instead, despite the stereotypes and aged images, this is an enjoyable read. Yes, some of the situations are a bit too standard and two or more characters are more cartoons than characters, but Follett uses history as a method to weave together a not unlikely plot and even to throw in a few twists and turns along the way.<br />Great airplane paperback reading.

B000002JS6|5.0|Seldom, if ever, a band who had just lost such a charismatic lead singer released an album so commercially successful and so full of amazing rock tunes. AC/DC managed it (Hagars initial album with Van Halen, 5150, also was a milestone in sales figures for the band, but it not sold like Back In BLACK, after all!)<BR>Back in Black stuns you for the opening notes of HELLS BELLS, and goes on indefinitely with a clear, heavier and crunchy sound, with new singer Brian Johnson still at the top pf his lungs capability. Back in Black ends a series of almost impossible amazing albuns by AC/DC: DIRTY DEEDS, LET THERE BE ROCK, POWERAGE, HIGHWAY TO HELL and BACK IN BLACK.
0553573403|5.0|Having brushed into this universe with the the prologal story<br />&quot;The Hedge Knight&quot; from the Legends compilation volume, I had different expectations about this book than what I actually encountered. This does not mean I was disappointed. The ruling house that we encountered in &quot;The Hedge Knight&quot; has been deposed with extreme predjudice, and is now all but extinct, fifteen years after the overthrow. The steward of the new king has died, and he comes north to ask his best friend to become the new steward. After an intense prologue where we are introduced to the NightWatch (and some of the reasons why they have to watch) we are then lead into the main body of the story, which starts off with a nightwatch Deserter being beheaded.<br />What is interesting about this book and hopefully its successors, is that there is no quest. The author is merely telling a story. There is no predictable goal that will lead us to the &quot;good-guys win/bad-guys lose&quot; conclusion. The story is made of more mundane challenges and intrigues. This gives it an element of realism that makes it almost drama instead of fantasy. I do not think that the author could have pulled it off, if he had not written each chapter as the point of view of an individual character, each chapter having the view-point of a different character. The only thing  that I did not care for was the emphasis that he placed on sex. The story has that through out. Most of the fantasy that I like places little emphasis upon that aspect of human life. However, Mr. Martin does this in a realistic fashion, and the manner in which he describes sex fits the story and makes the characters more realistic. They way he brings mating into the story adds an Arthurian element to the tale. The only complaint left to me then is the number of characters from whose point of view he tells the story. Given that this shift is essential to the way the story is written, that is a small complaint. This story is overall an excellent departure from the quest based fantasy with which I am more familiar. Mr. Martin said that he wanted to write this as historical fiction of a fictious fantasy world. He has done that in this book.This story is overall an excellent departure from the quest based fantasy with which I am more familiar.

B00003CY0V|4.0|I will seriously grant that Swordfish is a good movie, but it could have been better. In reading some of these reviews I see people either liked it, or they turned up their noses adn said it was too low-brow to be worth it. I just wish to say...People, get over yourselves. Swordfish was an interesting idea. Even a &quot;thinking man&quot; needs to stop thinking sometimes, and just let themselves go. The oopening scene and Travolta's monolouge are excellent, and it is the best use of the &quot;Matrix&quot; software since it was released. if you want Drama, rent Hamlet, if you want a &quot;wild ride&quot; movie....rent Swordfish.

B00005K9LM|2.0|THis could be, definitely, not a bad CD or a bad remaster. But it is bad.<br />First, the bonus tracks: <BR>To put the worst track of the album (HEAVY DUTY) as a live bonus must only be a joke.<BR>THen, in the brief text written by the band in the booklet, they say that they did not understand why the tune TURN ON YOUR LIGHT was kept out of the original album. It was left out because it´s a sugary, faceless ballad reminiscent of Poison, that´s all!!<br />As for the original album, it starts pretty well and goes all the way greatly until SOME HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL. Then everything crumbles miserably, with some of the worst Priest tracks ever: HEAVY DUTY, OUT IN THE COLD and NIGHT COMES DOWN, all unashamed pop-metal tunes with lousy drums. Anyway you look at it, you see DEFENDER is a good album, but pointed the way for terrible things to come (TURBO and RAM IT DOWN).

And shocker I loved her remake of &quot;I love Rock n' Roll&quot;. The whole album is just pure ear candy. Her best yet.

0671027379|5.0|I have never been one to spend much time reading fiction.  On a whim, I picked up this book to read it.  I read it in my spare time this week, and from the moment I started, I could think of nothing better to do.<br />This book leaves you wondering what's coming next, as the writer takes you through a plot that, for the most part, begs to be read more.  The last book I read, Rainbow Six, played up the characters too much (this guy is the best...)  In Deception Point, the characters seemed real, if not always palatable.  The plot, although stretched a little from reality, was certainly feasible.<br />For not being a well read fiction reader (I read a ton of non-fiction), the book was a good draw to me.  Normally, I will buy a book and lose interest after a short period of time...
B000002JS8|5.0|HIGHWAY TO HELL is a sad album. Why? Well, this is the album that definitely put AC/DC on the map, and soon after their charismatic lead singer, Bon Scott, perished in a futile accident, death by misadventure.<br />Atlantic records had been pressuring AC/DC a long time, for the release of an album with more &quot;acessible&quot; sound. They even had previously shelved the magnific 1976´s DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP, which was only released in Australia. After an unsucessful period of work with producer Eddie Kramer, assigned by Atlantic´s staff, the band worked together with John Mutt Lange. So be it. Something happened between abdn and producer, some magical chemistry. Lange managed to focus the peculiar band´s sound, to polish a little bit more, all of this without making AC/DC look commercial. He respected the guys. The final result was an essential recording, a gem, one of those rare albums when you don´t skip any track.

0785813500|5.0|Poe has been in my library since my grade school days.  And everytime I go back to him I always leave throughly impressed by Poe's ability to create a total effect in the mind of the reader with his prose and poetry.  A good example of this is The Pit and the Pendulum, where our hero is subjected to the most vile psychological torture you can imagine.  Every sentece leaves the reader no choice but to be horrified at the bleak conditions of the cell where the protagonist is kept.  In The Cask of Amontillado, the fate of Fortunato is clear for the reader after the first paragraph, however the sheer brillance of Poe is in the execution.  It is a perfect clock work, where each paragraph ineroxably leads to the next until the grim conclusion is reached.  I wont give it away, but even after more than a dozen reads it still is spellbinding.  For anybody interested in the Macabre, the Amazing or the plain creepy Poe is and always will be the master craftsmen!!
0140311254|5.0|I read Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl for my grade 5 LA class.  I really enjoyed this book.  Charlie is main character in this story.  He comes from an extremely poor family, his 4 grandparents live with his parents and Charlie.  The story centers around a Chocolate Factory that is giving out 5 golden tickets, which provide the lucky winners with a lifetime supply of chocolate and a tour of the factory.  The tour has no end of unexpected surprises.  The funniest character was Veruca Salt because she was going to steal a squirrel. The squirrels tackled her and then knocked her on the head (to see if she was a good or bad nut).  They decided she was a bad nut and then threw her down the garbage chute! This book is very hard to put down! There is also a movie available called Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.
B00004TH7Z|2.0|Now that all excitement we Maiden fans felt after the return of Dickinson and Smith, I think we can clearly see the continuing flaws of this album.<br />First) The album has 67 minutes of songs simply because Harris seems to have \\"loved\\" to take a chorus and repeat it twelve times in a row. Not four times; sometimes not even eight times, but 12 times. This formula was tested unshamedly in one of the worst MAiden songs of all times, Virtual XI´s THE ANGEL AND THE GAMBLER.<br />Second) As long as Janick Gers stays on the roster, there´s no real possibility for the old chemistry to come back. (...) have you heard the ammount of destruction he does in the solo in OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET???!!! Seldom have I heard such a bad solo from a highly regarded professional guitar player. It seems that he´s playing that bad on purpose!!<br />All that said, I know people would get angry with my review. But look into your heart. We love Maiden so much that, with each album, we expect a miracle to happen, to the good old days. But that has not came yet.
B00005214X|5.0|I saved up my paper route earnings when I was a kid and bought this on vinyl. I was eleven at the time, and ALL THINGS MUST PASS was the first album I ever bought with my own money. It was every bit as good as I dreamed it would be. What a grand statement George made with this album!  Of course, I eventually got ATMP on CD. The original CD issue has sound quality problems, as many others have mentioned, but the 2001 reissue sounds fabulous. I must say, I have a problem with people who weren't interested in ATMP (or other George recordings) until AFTER he died. Someone needs to explain this phenomenon to me.  Why go out and buy an artist's music when he is no longer around to reap the benefits? Why not show appreciation when the artist is still alive?
B00003CWL6|5.0|I've watched this film many MANY times, I believe it is the greatest movie I have ever seen--a MUST watch if you haven't seen it.  Kevin Spacey superbly plays the roll of a man who 'never felt this..sedated.'  He searches for happiness, and the entire film shows the truth behind life.  Also, I'd like to just recommend to anyone who loves this movie that they see the french film Amelie--it, too, is a must see if you like movies that show the truth of life.
B000002WCJ|5.0|The sequel to Helloweens Keeper of the Seven Keys pt. 1, called surprise, surprise pt.2. This is a worthy sequel in all respects, the sound seems more refined, and the tunes more harmonic and there seems to be a great contiunity to the record.<BR>The sound is Iron Maiden mixed with Accept.<BR>This album offers great entertainment and enjoyment for the listener, and especialy for those of us that remember the 80's, it brings back nostalgia.<br />After Keeper of the Seven Keys part 2 everything seemed to go downhill for Helloween, and nothing ever became quite as good again. If you want some of the best metal from the late 80's try Helloween, it is definately worth it.
0743201140|5.0|The naysayers apparently are missing the truly revolutionary aspects of this publication. The 'book' is really a 'ticket' to a personal assessment (yes, everyone has to buy their own...can you take your friends and family to the movies without paying for each of them?).<br />And yes, as another reviewer said, this will likely confirm some things you probably already knew about yourself, but there's more. Even as a writer, I could never have encapsulated the perspectives they provided me, the way that they did. Perhaps if the book had been based on 20 years of research rather than 30, I could have used the results to better posture my career progress for the past 10 years (if only it had been released 10 years ago).<br />In addition, the assessment acts as a 3rd-party validation of 'who you are'. I took the 'management perspective' comments from the back of the book and represented them in a single page (edited to remove value'less' phrases or repeated concepts across strengths) that I now include with my resume when applying for jobs (or related activities). The statements represent the value I can bring to a team from a perspective other than me 'selling myself'.
0385505833|5.0|Well woven tell of a couple's attempts to escape the ratrace and commerical tensel of another Christmas season!<br />Grisham abandons his legal motif and strides off into this short novel (this reviewer read it in two brief settings) which in his tight, clear writing style, touches so many veins that we all have at the busy, holiday season ----  trudging around in weather, the commercialness getting to us --- all the time missing the blessings that can come when we let them.<br />Great choice of name to the main character, Luther.<br />I enjoyed this and will make use of it in my Christmas preaching.  There is a good story here, one that can be shared, enjoyed and related at many levels of understanding and application.
B000002N3N|5.0|Enya's richly chorded style has smitten me once again.  A little bit Gregorian, a lot Celtic, combined with a soft, well crafted execution, gives us a CD anyone can enjoy and relax with.  Enya performs all the instruments and vocals on the album.  Her vocal style is willowy and sweet, which blends with the synthesizer and piano accompaniment perfectly.<br />This is great &quot;Hot Tub&quot; or massage music.  If you're not so lucky as to have both a tub and a masseuse available, just try a recliner with a glass of wine.  Enya has given us more great music, still with her unique perspective of flow and rhythm.  Her music remains timeless and fresh years after its release.
B000002W9P|5.0|Helloween, it brings back memories of my teenage room, with Iron Maiden posters over the walls, and a casette deck blasting of in the background. There was a lot of commotion when this was released...it sounded kinda like Iron Maiden....and then again not. This is what I would consider &quot;classic  metal&quot; alot of guitar solos, and fast lyrics. This is definately Helloweens best release ever(along with Keeper of the Seven Keys part 2). It sounds much better than the murkysounding Walls of Jericho, and supercedes many many times the lousy Pink Bubbles go Ape.<BR>On Keeper of the Seven Keys part 1, the crisp, fast guitars and the &quot;adventure/sci-fi lyrics&quot;, everything on this album is like it is supposed to be, to bring you back to that 80's Metal nostalgia. Followed by an equally masterful Part 2.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I've never seen this movie and probably won't until May 2002 when this \\"R\\" Rated version comes out. I read in some trade papers that Michael Bay was against the softball version of this film from the get-go, but the Mouse House honchos wanted to tone down the violence and play up the romance, which is exactly why everyone says this movie (is bad). This listing is a little mis-leading because most of these reviews refer to the sappy version in current DVD release.<br />I know that I am in the minority, but I'd rather see the movie for the first time as the director envisioned it. There is supposed to be much more realistic and graphic battle scenes that the studio forced him to trim and I'm pretty sure he was recording a feature length commentary track for this version as well. I did not notice this feature on the current DVD release, which is why I am writing this and why I am giving this version 5 stars.<br />This is just another money grabbing ploy by Di$ney to get people to buy the theatrical version first then come back in six months and say \\"This is the version you should have bought in the first place.\\" Mark my words - You'll start seeing the \\"expanded edition\\" commercials in late April, 2002.<br />Why don't they release this along with the original version as a dual disc set, or even publicize the fact that this is on it's way? So they can hide behind the \\"60th Anniversary\\" ploy and capitilize on the current wave of patriotism in America to line their pockets. Sorry Mr. Eisner, I'm not biting. Send a message to the studios about double-dipping and pre-order this version right now. They'll be watching the numbers. Buy it the way it was meant to be seen.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is an in your face, violent tale that is remarkable for its depth of insight into today's 20-something.  This movie is the polar opposite of a &quot;chick-flick.&quot;  The film is based around the life of a young professional who realizes that he has been robbed of his right to be a man (Edward Norton gives another stellar performance).  The story is about his struggle to embrace and reclaim man's natural instinct towards violence in a positive way.  If you liked the way all the story lines in Pulp Fiction came together at the end, you will love this film.  This one belongs in every man's collection alongside Braveheart and Galdiator.

Other than Raising Arizona there is no other movie that comes to mind with such brillant dialogue.  I'm positive that the Coen brothers are the greatest script writers to ever live.

The racecar sound effects make it sound awesome. <BR>4)LIBERIAN GIRL - A good foreign type smooth/mysterious slow song.<BR>5)JUST GOOD FRIENDS (w/ Stevie Wonder) - Your average 80's pop song.<BR>6)ANOTHER PART OF ME - A different MJ fast song, but it is awesome.<BR>7)MAN IN THE MIRROR - A good thinking song with a good message.<BR>8)I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU (w/ Sideah Garret) - A nice slow duet ballad.<BR>9)DIRTY DIANA - A nice low tempo rock/pop song. Very powerful.<BR>10)SMOOTH CRIMINAL - The ORIGINAL version. Picture the Alien Ant Farm cover but, a little bit more sane and poppy.<BR>11)LEAVE ME ALONE - Also has the motown like beat, pretty kool.<br />HIStory Continues: The Bonus Traxx<br />STREETWALKER - I Don't No why this didn't make it to the album!! This is my 4th favorite song on the album! It is a crossover between &quot;The way you make me feel&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot;<BR>I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU (Spanish Version) - This is pretty good. M's good at spanish.<BR>FLY AWAY - Another great song that didn't make it to the album. It kinda sounds like &quot;I just can't stop loving you&quot;.<br />&quot;Bad&quot; Special Edition is AWESOME. If you love MJ's Hitz, than get this album!!
B00000JJQK|5.0|The 24 bit remastered cd stereo version is my favorite, but it still seems to my ears that in attempting to have a very warm sound that &quot;swims&quot;, this album has always sounded somewhat muddy. Even with Brian's emulation of Phil Spector's &quot;wall of sound&quot;, just imagine if the strings and other instruments had a crisper sound?<br />Is there anyone else but me who hears it this way?
B00005OM4Q|5.0|The main character in Almost Famous is a 15 year old rock journalist named William Miller. He gets the chance to write an article for Rolling Stone magazine about an up and coming rock band, Stillwater. He goes out on tour with the band and what starts out as a simple assignment, turns into a life altering experience for all involved. The character of William is director and writer Cameron Crowe's on screen alter ego. Mr. Crowe was a 15 year old who wrote for Rolling Stone and the story is based on his life. The film also involves William's overprotective and aggressive mother (played by Frances McDormand) and the battles she waged with his sister. They are based on Mr. Crowe's own family's struggles and the fact that he was willing to air his family's problems in public adds a touch of humanity and reality to the film. Stillwater is led by Jeff Bebe and Russell Hammond who bicker at one another about the band's future and possible fame. Billy Crudup plays Russell the lead guitarist and Jason Lee is Jeff the lead singer. They have a natural fear of the press and refer to William as the enemy. In fact, William struggles to get an one on one interview with Russell throughout the film. The band is followed on tour by a bunch of groupies who refer to themselves as Band-Aids. Their leader is Penny Lane played wonderfully by Kate Hudson. She is in love with Russell, but it is William whom she confides in. The tender relationship between Penny &amp; William is one of the film's great strengths. Throughout the film, William seeks and gets advice from legendary rock critic Lester Bangs. Mr. Bangs is played amazingly by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman provides the film's conscious and his brief time on the screen is electric. All the performances in the film are first-rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self-righteous and Ms. McDormand is a fierce presence. But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William. Mr. Fugit had never appeared in a movie before and had minimal acting experience, but he is the emotional center of the film, the link between al the characters. He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture. Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's. His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time. Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script. Almost Famous is Mr. Crowe's love letter to his youth and the 70's. The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.  This is an expanded three disk DVD that has everything one could want regarding the film including a disk of Stillwater's live performance that was filmed for the movie and vintage Cameron Crowe Rolling Stone work.  The DVD is as expansive as any released and worth the few extra bucks.lliam.

The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.   This is an expanded three disk DVD that has everything one could want regarding the film including a disk of Stillwater's live performance that was filmed for the movie and vintage Cameron Crowe Rolling Stone work.  The DVD is as expansive as any released and worth the few extra bucks.
B00005RFAI|5.0|She does a complete 180 and focuses on more of a sound that will draw attention because of its lyrics, rather than a catchy beat. That's not to say she ditches R&amp;B and hip-hop, cuz she certainly does not, as evidenced by tracks #1, #5, #7 and #8. But it does show a more versatile side of pink and you get to see who she truly is.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I really don't have a lot to say except that when I bought this I didn't know anything about it much, but I did se her on TV.  She sure can dance!  In fact she's the best dancer I've seen.  Well anyway after I listened to the CD I kind of liked it then it grew on me and now I love it.  Can't say why, just do.  Try it if your like me and saw her on tv but arn't quite sure....you probably will like it as I did.
B00005O892|1.0|A terrible movie -- insulting and offensive. From the guys who brought us 'Armageddon' -- a film that I enjoyed simply because it was a big ridiculous thrill ride with just the right blend of cheese and FX. 'Pearl Harbor' is made with the same formula (and one of the same actors, Ben &quot;Get me to a damn plane!&quot; Affleck, who is nothing but an overgrown frat boy strutting for the camera), but it fails because when you put a name, face and race on a metaphorical asteroid and call it the Japanese, the fun disappears and the slurs begin (I stopped counting the times I heard &quot;damn Japs&quot;). Yes, the FX are great, but it's Titantic territory revisited, and after a while you're yawning your way through yet another extra flailing in the water, yet another explosion, etc. They should have made the battles scenes into a one hour reenactment for cable and cut out the rest of the film -- the hour before and the hour after the attack are incredibly predictable and full of pandering, formulaic cheese. The love story is disjointed and the characters are cartoons -- Affleck is his usual brawny mess, Josh Harnett puts forth a decent young-Tommy-Lee-Jones effort but can't save his doomed Danny, and Kate Beckinsale pulls a Kate Winslet by hopping from a respected place on the international/independent circuit to an unfortunate hair-and-makeup turn in a disaster blockbuster (Winslet has barely recovered from &quot;the boat film&quot;... let's cross our fingers for poor Beckinsale, who shouldn't be wasting her time with stuff like this).  Why Cuba Gooding, Jr. chose to take part at all is beyond me. Dan Ackroyd, on the other hand, is right up his own alley as the Navy Intelligence man who saw it coming -- in real life, Ackroyd is the Alien Intelligence man who is waiting for an extraterrestrial encounter so that he can tell us he told us so... so I think he had some fun. As for Alec Baldwin, he's on the fast track to becoming one of the worst actors of all time, and Jon Voight is apparently trying to add historical charicatures to his resume (he's following his cartoon Roosevelt with another study in prosthetics as Howard Cosell in 'Ali'). 'Pearl Harbor' rips off many other disaster/war films from 'Titanic' to 'Top Gun', and is nothing more than a great big mess. I don't condemn it completely because of Hartnett's effort, the FX, and James King, who makes an easy, natural step from highly succesful model to competent actress (her Betty is one of the few characters you actually feel something for, spared simply because she wasn't given the screen time to become a cartoon). Otherwise, I would actively discourage any thinking filmgoer from suffering through this movie. Mike &amp; Jerry should stick to asteroids.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I am the mother of 2 year old twins and they love it.  My daughter will pick up the remote and throw it at me if she sees anything other than her big green ogre.  I know it's very difficult to wear out a disk, but I think that we are well on our way.  The twins especially like the music and love to dance to it.  I highly recommend this for all ages!  Enjoy!
B00005NWM3|2.0|From an unbiased point of view and an avid hard rock fan, I gave this album a fair try, but after completing the album, I found myself wondering how this band is so popular.  Most of the songs are either easily forgetable or repetitive, lacking in diversity and catchiness.  It's the type of songs you can listen to for the first few times, but after a while you get sick of hearing it as it lacks any flavor.<br />Recommend you pass on this one.  Recommendations on albums to buy this year would be Incubus &quot;morning view&quot;, Stone Temple Pilots &quot;shangri-la dee da&quot;, Pod &quot;satellite&quot;, and Linkin Park &quot;hybrid theory&quot;.
B000001ES9|4.0|By the time the band's 1981 landmark album Moving Pictures was released, the Rush of 1974 was long gone. What's odd though, is that by the time 2112 was released in 1976, this sound was already gone.  I can recall reading a review that came out in 1974 where the reviewer called Rush &quot;a bad Led Zeppelin rip off&quot;. While I can't say that I agree with that assessment, this album sounds a lot closer to Led Zeppelin than it does to the Rush of the 80's and 90's.<br />Basically, if you want good rock and roll to play extremely loud, this is a great album for that. Just sit back and listen as &quot;Finding My Way&quot; slowly increases its volume. Some songs are just short, feel-good type rock songs including &quot;Need Some Love&quot; and &quot;In the Mood&quot; (which I think they still do live). The best songs are the previously mentioned &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, &quot;What You're Doing&quot;, and the classic &quot;Working Man&quot; (do not, I repeat, do not listen to &quot;Working Man&quot; with the volume turned down low. This is a sin of the highest magnitude and will be punished by Geddy Lee himself).  Rush only got better through their careers. If you want the rock and roll side of the band, this is what you need.
B00004Z459|5.0|With their debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, Linkin Park has exploded into the mainstream genre with a sound unlike any other nu-metal/rap rock act.  With heavy crunching guitar riffs, melodicly diverse vocals, and a pace changing backup, industrial-rap vocal.<br />Unlike other similiar genre acts, this band has found the beauty of adding melody and meaning to their madness.  A well-balanced album throughout, giving us 12 strong, steady tracks.  Highlights include &quot;Papercut&quot;, a multi-level, rap-rock heavy beginning with a wonderfully melodic, pace changing ending.  &quot;In the End&quot;, a steadily paced tune with a soft touch.  &quot;Pushing me Away&quot; and &quot;Forgotten&quot;
B00005JKHP|3.0|As the other reviews will tell you, the enhancements are great.  Computer graphic additions and improvements/changes/additions to the sound effects make this a great remake.  It could have been five stars, but someone should have told Mr. Wise that &quot;director's cut&quot; doesn't necessarily mean &quot;cut it&quot;.  He should have created a &quot;special edition&quot; DVD and not tried so hard to shorten the movie.  There were some major scenes completely removed and alot of other scenes got little cuts in them.  Viewers are used to the full length version.  Remember the scenes they chopped back out of Star Trek II?  This is similar - only worse.  I hope whenever they get around to making the special edition for Star Trek II, they &quot;Wise&quot; up and put the scenes back in this time.
0684833395|5.0|Don't let the length of it to tire you, at the end you wouldn't want it to end. Take it slow and enjoy every sentence.
B00005O5CM|5.0|If I were just reviewing the movie &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, I'd probably give it 4 stars.  Reese Witherspoon is great, the dialog is fun, the characters are fun, and the plot, while adhering to every formulaic lawyer movie cliche in the book, is nonethless quite enjoyable.<br />Where this DVD really shines, tough, is in the special features.  I'm not generally a big fan of DVD special features, but these ones are really worth watching.  I especially liked the &quot;trivia track&quot;, which adds &quot;pop-up video&quot;-style trivia bubbles throughout the film.<br />Another nice feature was the inclusion of crew commentary in addition to the one by the director and Reese Witherspoon.  The crew can give a completely different perspective on the making of any movie, and I'd like to see more DVDs include this kind of material.<br />I also liked &quot;The Hair That Ate Hollywood&quot;, a short documentary on what they did to Reese Witherspoon's hair for the movie.  I never realized just how much work could go into making a beautiful blonde continue to look like a beautiful blonde, and it makes for an entertaining short.<br />My only complaint on the special features is that they put the supplemental material on the flip side of the DVD, rather than on a second DVD.  I would normally like that approach, because I normally don't like the special features, but in this case, it would have been nice to have both parts playable on my DVD changer.

B00005R2M3|2.0|I think she screw herself with this album. she was GREAT singing in spanish. Now, she made the stupid crossover. She didn't need to do that! And the english version of Ojos as (Eyes like yours) it's horrible. it loses every sense in the song. (...)

B000055Y12|4.0|The story as I got it:  Leon Uris writes books about the middle east for the most part.  Exodus, Mila 18, QB VII, The Haj.  He has an enormous reputation for well researched, gripping novels based on historical fact.  What reason is there to believe he was willing to abandon that reputation for Topaz?  In researching the book QB VII, I'm told, he stumbled across a story that he felt had to be told, and interrupted his work on QB VII to write Topaz.  For reasons of drama, and personal security, it was necessary to rearrange some facts and personalities, but the story is said to be essentially true.<br />As noted by another reviewer, the movie is good, but not great Hitchcock.  Maybe, it has to do with the truthfulness of the story converting to an action movie.  A similar situation arose in the attempt to make a movie out of Ken Follett's On Wings of Eagles.<br />I think Hitchcock gave this movie the attention it deserved, but let's face it.  It is easier for anyone to control the pace and action in a fictional work.  The marvel of this movie and the novel upon which it was based, is the way that fiction was interwoven in an essentially true story, leaving the audience to wonder. Which parts were fiction?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is hands down one of the most amazing films ever created.  Its creativity and sheer energy is unsurpassed by any other film.  When I went to see it, I had no idea what I was about to sit through.  It began dark and mysterious and opened into a world of music and dance I will never forget.  When I heard of the release date for the DVD I reserved four copies right off the bat.  You have to see Moulin Rouge to witness this landmark in cinematic history.  Thank you Baz for giving our generation this film to cherish for years to come.
6304779607|5.0|This film is great! (...) This was like one of the first of Stallone films that I had watched after the Rocky series. Maybe it's a little cheesey, but it's how all movies were made in the 80's. I like the beginning where Stallone comes in to the supermarket. Some dark scenes in the film. Substantial amount of violence, good film. It actually has a good story to it, yep another cop story against the bad guys. Fair Game.
0425152251|3.0|&quot;Sophie's World&quot; by Jostein Gaarder, can be considered to be a cult book. When it was first puplished back in 1992, it gained a great success in Norway, after wich it spread around the world.<br />I've got to admit that making a novel about history and philosophy can't be an easy job. You must make the information interesting, so that the novel works as a story.<br />Has Gaarder succeeded in this?<br />No.<br />&quot;Sophie's World&quot;, as is atmitted in the novel itself, is mainly just a philosophy study book for school students. It tells a story of a young girl named Sophie, who starts recieving strange letters from an equally strange philosopher, telling stories about philosophy and history.<br />The content of those letters is taken straight from a highschool philosophy book. They are dry and full of irrelevant trivia and dates, and on the top of that, those segments take approximately 80% of the whole novel, as the actual so-called &quot;plot&quot; advances with painstaikingly minor steps between the endless philosophy lectures.<br />The characters are horribly written. For example, Sophie can be described fully with the words: &quot;a 14 year old Norwegian girl who has never thought of ANYTHING even mildly profound&quot;. What I mean by this is that when she resieves the first letter from her instructor, that has only the question: &quot;Who are you?&quot; written on it, it's obvious she has never given one thought to her own identity. Similar questions like &quot;Since when has the world been there?&quot; are equally new to this 14 year old person, who's obviously spent all those years thinking everything but those basic philosophical questions we all start asking when we're little children.<br />Gaarder has written the whole novel to be reader underastimating, trying, in my opinion, desperately to give the impression he's somehow exeedingly smart and creative, when actually he's only achieved this very obvious illusion by breaking basic storytelling rules and creating story structures full of air. On the top of that, the ending of the book appeares to be taken out of nowhere, and doesn't at all seem planned and thought out of, wich frustrates the reader even more.<br />Don't get me wrong. &quot;Sophies World&quot; wasn't a wasted read. It gives loads of precise, if basic information about the history of western philosophy, adding names like Darwin and Freud, who are usually thought of only as groundbreaking scientist to the lot of great thinkers, even if it, to my great suprise, ignores Ockham and his nominalism, wich I personally consider to be quite a fascinating philosophical approach method.<br />&quot;Sophie's World&quot; is garbled and horribly paced, but an interesting book nontheless.
B00000BKDZ|4.0|Before I listened to this CD I had high expectations coming in. Judging from reviews on this sight this was supposed to be an epic concept-album and Maiden's greatest moment. I was expecting, from a lot of high reviews and some low reviews, that this album is going to be a masterpiece or a pretentious synth-laden mess. I actually found a little of both. This album is sure overated. No way this is better than the immortal \\" Powerslave \\" or even better than its predeccesor \\" Somewhere In Time \\" This is still a great album to buy after you've bought \\" Number Of The Beast \\", \\" Piece Of Mind \\", \\" Powerslave \\", \\" Somewhere In Time, and the awesome \\" Brave New World \\" It's supposed concept isn't well put together. Even for a concept album it's pretentious. You don't even notice the story while listening to the songs except for in the beginning and in the title track. It's also dissapointing that there's no epic songs on this album. Sure the title track is almost 10 minutes, but 2.5 minutes of a song with an insanely repetive chorus plus pretentious chanting plus 7 minutes of wankery, very good wankery though, does not an epic make. This album is also notable in that it was Maiden's commercial peak. It spawned an unprecedented 4 singles, 1 which was classic, 1 which was great, 1 which was good, and 1 which was an embarassing slice of cheese. Anyway heres my grades.  <br />                                          Song Grades<br />1. Moonchild-The \\" 7 deadly sins \\" intro is a great moment, it also closes out the album, but this, while a good opener, isn't as good as \\" Where Eagles Dare \\", \\" Aces High \\", or \\" Caught Somewhere In Time \\" The D & D lyrics also bring this song down and they could have made a better chorus. Still a rockin' tune though.<br />     Final Grade-B<br />2. Infinite Dreams-Every Maiden album, except for the two Bayley albums has a masterpiece song on it and this one takes the cake on this one. This \\" Revelations \\" like energetic semi-ballad is perhaps Dickinsons finest vocal performance. They would rehash the subject matter of this song on \\" Dream Of Mirrors \\" on \\" Brave New World \\" This is Maidens best song ever released as a single.<br />     Final Grade-A+<br />3. Can I Play With Madness-Here comes the first mistep on the album. Sure this got them some radio-play, but this embarassing cheeze-fest is still one of their worst songs. The chorus (is bad) and the lyrics sound like Poison using fantasy lyrics. \\" Flight Of Icarus \\" was a little cheesy too, but at least it was emotional and had great guitar. It wasn't ruined by the synths as this song was. Not that great to begin with anyway.<br />     Final Grade-D+<br />4. The Evil That Men Do-It isn't the greatest song in the world, but its sung in such an energetic way and it has a great haunting chorus that you can't help but like it. I can't get the \\" Living on a razors edge, balancing on a ledge, you know... \\" chorus out of my head. It's the 2nd best song on the album. Great choice for a single.<br />     Final Grade-A-<br />5. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son-You could view this either of two ways. If you view it as a song, it fails. If you look at it as a good mood piece on a concept album like \\" In The Flesh \\" from \\" The Wall \\" it's great. I'm still a little disappointed because as the title track it should be the best or close to the best song on the album. All of Maidens other title tracks are excellent by the way.<br />     Final Grade-C+<br />6. The Prophecy-This is a pretty underated song. If they made better lyrics for this song it could have become a Maiden classic. The lyrics though bring it down.<br />     Final Grade-B-<br />7. The Clairvoyant-Great guitar in the beginning. This was one of their big singles from this album. I really like the chorus on this song. This is a good song, but not as good as previous singles like \\" The Trooper \\" or \\" 2 Minutes To Midnight \\"<br />     Final Grade-B<br />8. Only The Good Die Young-This song should have been released as a single instead of the retarded \\" Can I Play With Madness. The only problem I have is that as an album closer they could have made this song longer and more epic. This song had the potential. Could have made it into another \\" To Tame A Land \\"<br />     Final Grade-B+<br />I feel that Maiden should have kept only the good material they wrote from 85-88. Then they would have had a tremendous album. They should have kept \\" Caught Somewhere In Time \\", \\" Infinite Dreams \\", \\" Heaven Can Wait \\", \\" Alexander The Great \\", \\" The Evil That Men Do \\", \\" Sea Of Madness \\", \\" Wasted Years \\", and \\" Only The Good Die Young \\" Imagine what a great album that would have been.
B000002MP2|4.0|Dookie is, in one word, awesome. The only reason i didnt put 5 stars on the score, is because its not the BEST green day cd. The songs that i like most are &quot;Longview&quot;, &quot;Basket case&quot; and &quot;When i come around&quot;. A must-have cd for any punk-rock fan though not better than Nimrod or Insomniac, but different and very original.
B00003CXCS|5.0|The movie is more than thirty-five years old, the musical is more than forty years old, and both have withstood the ravages of time.  This is a masterpiece of the American musical beautifully adapted to the screen.  <br />The casting is excellent, from Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer in the starring roles, to the children, each of whom has a distinct personality and screen presence, to the nuns, headed by the lovely Peggy Wood (and including an on-screen appearance by Marni Nixon who supplied the singing voice for Natalie Wood, Audrey Hepburn, and Deborah Kerr to name but three), to Eleanor Parket and Richard Hayden in the supporting roles.  The scenery is gorgeous from the first aerial view of the mountains to the last and the interiors, particularly those in the Von Trapp house, are sumptious.<br />Since most viewers have already seen this movie either in the theatre, on TV, or in video-format (either commercial or taped from TV) or perhaps on LaserDisc, the real question is, &quot;Do I need the DVD version?&quot;<br />In the case, the answer is yes.  The extra offerings are interesting and help increase the viewers enjoyment of the movie, plus, they are full of bits of useful (or is that useless?) trivia.  OK, now let's all watch once more to find the real Maria von Trapp in the crowd...<br />As with most DVD's the real advantage is being able to cue a particular scene for those times when you don't want to watch the entire movie -- no more guessing and backing-up.<br />So, unless you are just toooo cultured to enjoy this classic musical, consider adding this DVD to your library, or, better yet, give it to a young person who has yet to be introduced to &quot;the hills are alive....&quot;
B00003CX97|5.0|I had mixed feelings about this movie when it first came out...I was 13 and living in Japan - into WWII themes (looking for &quot;War souvenirs&quot; and playing with Japanese kids...) I loved the suspense and vivid colors and was haunted by the ever-enduring jungle and its sounds..(Ceylon, or Sri Lanka was an excellent choice for a filming locale - looked alot like Burma,<BR>where most of the story was to have taken place). The characters, of course, were what I focused on as I grew older and<BR>viewed the movie again and again. The American, played by William Holden, of course, had to be anti-war and vaguely anti-British and colonial...This was to be expected and was not a great surprise. Major Warden, played by Jack Hawkins, was my favorite. He played a type of Englishman that I greatly admired when I was 20; a combination of scholar and warrior which the British can only carry off. Brilliant student of foreign languages and archaelogist who gets a thrill out of leading indigenous peoples to victory over the enemy (T.E. Lawrence and<br /> Sir Leonard Wooley come to mind)...<br />     Katchanaburi in Thailand is the site of the real Bridge, some of which can still be seen today...The bridge was hit by B-25s flying from India...not as romantic as parachuting into occupied Burma and humping the jungle. I was amazed by the similarity of the movie location and the real location...the movie people cetainly did their homework on that one. There is an Allied cemetery there in town, and a nice museum near the bridge (reconstructed), which can be crossed...some good Thai restaurants also make  a very relaxing and educational visit.<BR>Even though the movie and the real story were different in those respects, I feel that the movie was very enjoyable and entertaining in its own right.
B00005Q4ED|1.0|This is the worse version of Jane Eyre I've ever seen. I cannot believe that Scott would even consider doing a movie like this. British accent? HA! Not even in his dreams. That was distracting enough. A story of this kind needs a certain amount of subtlety and Scott has none. Thank goodness I saw this as a special showing and did not pay money for it. See the Timothy Dalton BBC version instead. Much more enjoyable.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Pure beauty...this movie reflects all aspects of beauty! The deeper meaning to it all makes the movie adored by any age and audience. There was the awkward noise at the beginning, the silence, then the noise, and silence again...but it does not come together until the end. The director did a superb job, as did Tom Hanks! I give em' my ten thumbs up once again
B00005QXXO|5.0|Wow. That's all I can say about Thom Yorke and his fellow Radiohead blokes. These guys just don't stop churning out fantastic music, and they sound fresher and fresher with each and every recording. This collection of live tracks is something that seems like a quick way for a record company to make a buck on a hot property, but it's not that at all. For anyone unable to catch Radiohead on tour, and for those who want to relive one of their electric performances again and again, this is just what the doctor ordered. Songs from Kid A and Amnesiac are played with a blistering fervor that everything seems blasted through with a new layer of meaning and intensity. After listening to the last two albums with their huge amounts of studio mastering and electronic effects, it boggles the mind that these tunes could be played with such mastery in a live venue, but Radiohead does it, and does it perfectly.
0385505833|4.0|I do agree with another reviewer that the literary sophisticaion does not measure up to Dickens, but this book is a quick, easy, yet enjoyable read. Although taking a cruise to run away from Christmas stress and expenses may seem appealing, the story makes one realize that selfishness does not bring joy to anyone, even a vain couple such as this Mr. Krank and his weak-willed wife. Christmas can become quite expensive each year, but the solution to the this problem is not to cut expenses in half and spend half that sum on oneself, as the writer shows in this beautiful story. The string of people whose appeals the selfish couple rudely and obstinately ignores extends over many pages. Nothing moves them, however, except another selfish motive. The impact of this book can be not only on how one views Christmas but all of life. God's perfect Word teaches, &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35).&quot;
6305922756|5.0|This is Spinal Tap was basically an improvisation by some of the funniest comics working during the early 1980s. While the 80 or so minutes that made the final cut are priceless, there was plently of gem material left on the cutting room floor. The deleted material is the strongest feature in this very impressive  DVD. The picture quality is relavitely poor in some areas of the cut material (it's likely the film wasn't stored under ideal conditions), but virtually everything is good for a laugh.<BR> The audio commentary done from the perspective of the Spinal Tap  characters is also funny, but no more interesting than the commentary Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean did on the original DVD release. The character's commentary actually grows a bit tired after a while.<BR>  The menu boards are attractive and hilarious.
B000007491|5.0|I first heard this album in 1979 and was immediately hooked on it. I just now have been able to obtain the CD and after all these years it's still a favorite of mine from Supertramp. Sure, it sounds tentative in places, a bit uneven (it's still interesting to me how the track &quot;Try Again&quot; completely breaks down before the final refrain, but those wandering, odd moments before it starts back up again work so well!), but the album works as a mild masterpiece of sorts. Some other favorite bits for me are the haunting acoustics of &quot;Aubade: And I am not like other birds of prey&quot;, &quot;Nothing to Show&quot; and &quot;Maybe I'm a Beggar.&quot; Give this early stunner a listen. You can sense how the band would evolve in the years to come.
B00004TH6O|2.0|I bought this album expecting some quality tunes but was unfortunatly let down. I heard the song 'Feel Good Hit of the Summer' and thought that it had some quality to it. When I listened to the album in it's entirety it just kinda bored me and left me wanting more. I hope future stoner-rock bands don't follow in the Queens of the Stone Age's footsteps cause if they do there's gonna be a dark dark future...
B0000029GA|5.0|Its as simple as that. In an era when West Coast gangsta rap was the fad of the day and you were lucky to see your favorite New York group's video on the national countdown, here came Nas dubbed as the second coming of Rakim Allah, and the catalyst who not only is from &quot;the Bridge&quot; but was the bridge from Ol School to New School hip hop. To me this album was the one defining album that brought about the last &quot;Golden Era&quot; in hip hop, it is the best album by a soloist ever,,bar none.
B00005QCYD|3.0|JURASSIC PARK 3 could be viewed as the weakest in the series for a number of reasons. First, there's far less dino action (...). The plot is weak... I mean COME ON, DINO's that can talk to eachother?! Much less live in harmony with humans?! And what about the cell phone thing?! Anyways I digress. Besically in JURASSIC PARK 3, the dinosaurs are somehow comical and fake. The story goes like this... A couple forces \\"the scientist/dino guy\\" (Sam Neil) to go with them the the \\"island of dinosaurs\\" so that they can find their son (who crashed onto the island a few months ago). So, they end up crashing on the island and the fun begins. I thought JURASSIC PARK 3 was the weakest in the series but it was still fun. It seemed really short too. All in all it's worth taking a look at. The DVD edition comes with a ton of bonus stuff.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Techincal achievements:<BR>=======================<BR>- Visual effects are excellent. Color contrast and clarity are well above average. Some perspectives, like that of dog-fights among the fighter planes and exploded fighters in mid-air, were nicely done in terms of its intended effect.

B00005QK3W|5.0|This album is awesome.  Better than Run Devil Run.  I'm glad he wrote that song freedom, because he wants the world to be free from these terrorist attacks that happened on Sept. 11.  This is one of his albums you must put in your music collection.
B00005JKOV|4.0|The movie was interesting in relating life and existence, common understanding and accepted ideas, and that was the primary focus of it.  I enjoyed the notions that were shared in it, but it was generally without much of a plot, more a string of thoughts.  I would enjoy to watch it for the mind-expansion, but it can wear you down in a dark movie theater.  I had to go after about an hour of watching it.  I can sleep at home.  But I will be watching it again, possibly with a purchase in the equation.
B000000OEI|4.0|I very much enjoy this score. The main title is very powerful and memorable, unfortunately it only appears once in the beginning of the score and then twice towards the end. This score pioneered Zimmer's electronic scoring, and it sounds it. More orchestral work would have been nice, but the choirs more than make up for it. Overall, a good score that is oftentimes hard to listen to.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I just bought this DVD, and it's great!  I truly enjoyed the film.  The DVD is nothin short of amazing.  The picture quality, sound, and special effects are really nice.  I still don't see why people compare this movie to &quot;Titanic&quot; though.  I mean, just cuz it has a love story with disaster??  That happens all the time.  Plus, in the making of the movie, the fictional characters (Ben, Josh, Kate) are all BASED on TRUE and real people and things that actually happened and lived during this time.  It's not hard to imagine a pilot or army commander falling in love with a nurse.  That kind of stuff happened all the time back then. <br />The only thing I will  compare this movie to Titanic with is how this movie AND Titanic really made me actually FEEL like I was back in that time period. It was amazing. Micheal Bay did something that was kind of hard to do, which is give people a sense of being in the 1940's. <br />Really, I don't think that Pearl Harbor's video/dvd release was trying to capitalize on patriotism in line of these past recent events we've had in our own country.  The Dec 4th release date was talked about LONG before the Sept. 11th events.  If anything, the release date was supposed to sort of coincide with the actual BOMBING date (Dec. 7th).  That's like saying that all these new car commercials we have are capitalizing on Patriotism.  ANd you KNOW they are.  &quot;Oh great, we're in a war, now's the time to buy more American CARS!!&quot;  THAT'S pathetic if you ask me.  <br />I guess there will always be haters and likers of this movie.  I personally enjoyed it.  But if you want, I'd pick up this DVD, it really is nice.<br />Last note: this movie isn't like Saving Private Ryan, or Glory, or even Tora Tora Tora.  Those movies just focused more on the WAR aspect of that time.  I wouldn't really call Pearl Harbor a WAR film in that sense.   But I think that it focused mainly on Pearl Harbor.  Wich is why this film isn't called &quot;The A-bomb&quot;, or &quot;How America Fought the Japenese&quot;, or &quot;World War 2&quot;.  No, this movie was JUST on &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.  So, if you want to see a REAL view of World War 2, I suggest watching the history channel.  They have a lot of tapes out now since Pearl Harbor came out.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is simply atrocious.  If you want a good American war film go try Patton or Saving Private Ryan.  The fight scenes are somewhat decent, but the love story and plot is an insult to the viewer.
0449227545|4.0|I got this book from a friend. When I entered Amazon.com to check out the reviews I almost did not read it at all. I gave it a shot any way and I was quite surprised. This is a very exciting book. The pace is fast, the caracters are very well developed and the pages flow really fast. I honestly did not understand all the thrashing this book got from the readers. Sure it is no Pillars of the Earth but it is really worth reading.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|This is a classic comedy! A must buy that will keep you laughing all the night through tracking down memories of this fabulous movie. Buy it now for a cheap price to give your funny bones a wriggle and your cheeks a jiggle.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This CD is beautiful.  The production and instrumentation are AMAZING.  It can throw you off a bit when you first listen but keep listening -- it will stun you about the second or third time through.  And try to listen to it all the way through without skipping songs -- this will assure you have the ultimate Rainbow Children experience.  <br />OH -- AND DON'T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY LIKE ALL THESE PEOPLE ALL WORRIED ABOUT THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS INFLUENCE, ETC.  LET PRINCE EXPERIENCE WHAT HE WANTS -- JUST ENJOY IT AS A PIECE OF ART FROM AN ARTIST.  DO NOT TRY TO ANALYZE OR JUDGE IT!!

You will go to the strengthsfinder website and take the test.  The test doesn't take long, just 30 min.  Once the code for the book is used, you cannot take the test again.  The code is done.  So, do not purchase a used one, because you will not be able to take the test.  This test will give you your top 5 strengths.  This is the most accurate strengths test I've taken.  This test identifies not only the strengths that you have, but also the strengths that are in you that you can develop.  I am in a college class right now, and we all thought it could benefit our class community so all 60 of us took the test.  So far, it has helped greatly in understanding how each other thinks and looks at ideas.  Knowing your strengths is very encouraging, and no it doesn't identify your weaknesses.  Why focus on those? I highly recomment this book!  You will be glad that you did!
B0000032LS|5.0|I first saw this movie the other day with my husband (we are in our late 30's). When I heard the music I knew I had to have the soundtrack. I can do my housework to this music and it motivates me, so in a way, I get my exercise and my house cleaning done. Great soundtrack, well worth the price.
B0000024U8|3.0|When I was young (a long time ago), this album was magic. Bloomfield stills excells on several tracks and his guitar playing envokes good memories. However, the playing here is mostly dated. The original Paul Butterfield albums with Mike Bloomfield however, are still high on my play lists. This album for me is mostly memorable for the Stephen Stills rework of 'Season of the Witch' which captivates after 30+ years.
B0000028RR|5.0|When it comes to this album, I'm in awe of how well everything was put together. This is about as close to perfect you will find on an album. To inform a certain person, Wake up was a direct result of Kashmir. Listen to the song. The similarities don't end there either. The song Vietnow on Evil Empire is also a direct result of The Wanton Song, also done by Led Zeppelin. It's no coincidence that Led Zeppelin is a huge influence on Rage, especially Tom Morello. So I think you should know what you're talking about before you tell someone else that they don't.
0688170528|4.0|This is a very well-paced novel that kept me going till the end. I didn't believe in the ending, however -- it just didn't ring true. Ironically, the character who seemed most vivid to me was that of Emily, despite being mysterious and absent throughout the book. The questions of her choosing death have stuck with me long since reading this book several months ago. This is the sort of book I enjoyed most when I was in my teens because it inspires discussion.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna is pure talent.  She can sing, dance, act, direct, choreograph, write, photograph and influence fashion.  An astute business person, there is really nothing she can't do.<br />This excellent collection features high caliber songs that are not only fun to dance to, but thought provoking.  The title song, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is truly a masterpiece.  I love it!  This is without a doubt the best collection Madonna has ever done.  I also like the spiritual themes in many of her more recent songs.  I have a lot of respect for Madonna, her talent and this collection in particular.<br />This is such a treat.
B000002A33|5.0|I bought this CD used for $3 knowing what a great song &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; was and figuring their later stuff might be as good.  Little did I know that I had stumbled onto one of the best CDs I have heard in years! How were these guys not huge?  Buy it and love it!
B000059HCJ|5.0|Most reviews have already told you the story, how three heroin addicts and one diet drug maven spin out of control and self destruct.  I was clued into this film by my college son as the ultimate anti-drug movie out there.  I totally agree.  I see most movies and was thorougly impressed with the superior editing of this film.  Everything about the pacing of camera work, along with the wonderful Kronos Quartet interpretations, not only kept me on edge, but easily conveyed the actual rush of drug use, and the desperation of the next hit.  Pretty cool.
B00005QZGC|5.0|25 years since I first heard it, Tangerine Dream's &quot;Rubycon&quot; still has the power to send shivers down my spine! Their second album for Virgin records, and consisting of just a single 35-minute work (split in the middle for the old vinyl side-change, of course) this is perhaps the most symphonic of Tangerine Dream's works. It is certainly, even now, the most beautiful and the most elegantly structured, as well as the most mystical, with its soaring, contemplative mellotron choirs, lush tam-tam rolls and hypnotic pulse-laden textures. It is also the least overtly 'pop' in style and steadfastly refuses classification even now. Haunting and delicate synthesiser motifs blend with the sounds of prepared pianos and custom modified organs and other electronics, all of which ensure a uniqueness to the sound world which no-one has ever come close to emulating. A superb mastery of minimalist rhythmic patterns, together with a perfect sense of timing in the development of their material and knowing just when to introduce new elements combine to make this a truly great masterpiece that is set to live forever.<br /> This newly remastered edition is a joy to hear, too. Although some parts of the quiet opening passage remain a little murky, many of the technical problems of the original have been more or less eliminated (or at least substantially reduced) and the louder passages have come up an absolute treat. The flanging of the recorded beach-breakers in the middle of Part II comes through beautifully, too-much clearer than on older releases. The rather raggy ending of the original has been tidied up too and I think Virgin are fully justified in labelling this release as the definitive edition!<br /> At less than 35 minutes overall, this CD remains as scandalously stingy as it ever was, but its beauty soon forces you to forgive it this failing. Own it! Treasure it! Short it may be, but it is oh, so sweet!
1559408898|5.0|Paul Verhoeven has always been a favorite director of mine. (Ever since I saw Total Recall, I was hooked) So naturally, I watch of all of his latest flicks. Finally, I decided to rent Robocop, one of his first action movies. I was pretty sure it was going to be good and violent - that's Paul Verhoeven's definite style of directing. So I sat down and watched it.<br />It's basically about a cop named Alex Murphy who is gunned down 20 minutes in to the movie by thugs. Still alive, he is made in to a Robocop, a cop that's machine and man. (Mostly machine, or man?) Anyway, Robocop/Murphy ends up seeking revenge against the thugs and finding out if he's human or not. <br />The first time I saw it, I hated it and would give it one star. There wasn't as much action as I expected (compared to Starship Troopers) and it was way more violent then I thought, especially the ending. But as I watched it again and again, hoping it would get better, it did. I started to focus more on the character Murphy then the action. After viewing it for the fifth time, It was on my &quot;top 10&quot; list. The character development is great, the action is superb (the best action scene in the movie is when Robocop busts 20+ guys in a drug warehouse.) and the movie is quite funny. The most amusing parts are the media breaks and better yet, the commercials. (NUKEM, and &quot;I'd buy that for a dollar! Ha, ha, ha!&quot;)<br />The only grief I have about this movie is that you only see about ten minutes of Murphy when he was human. It would've been better if you could've got to know him a little better as a human. Also, Murphy's death scene and the melting toxic waste dude were a bit over the top for me.<br />The Criterion Collection DVD is worth 4 out of 5 stars. The 3 storyboards are pretty interesting , (two of the storyboard sequences were never shot, but I think they should have) the animated menus are good, the picture and sound is great, the essay in lengthy but informative, and last but not least, the commentary is magnificent. Also, it's an X-rated director's cut, so violence freaks will enjoy.<br />This robot movie is much better than the sequels that followed and &quot;The Terminator.&quot; (&quot;The Terminator&quot; lacked the humor) So if you like sci-fi action, pick up the Criterion Collection and watch it. It well worth the money.<br />NOTE: This DVD is out of print, so you can't find it in any store. The only place you can buy it (that I know of) is here at amazon.com.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I bought the soundtrack and liked part of it, the rest I thought was dumb. Then I got the movie and was bowled over. I now love the soundtrack because it reminds me of parts of the movie.<br />This is a must see movie for all. It is funny, sad, and Clooney's role is a real change of pace for him.
B0000062S0|4.0|I love Led Zeppelin, and I've followed all of the solo work of Page, Plant, and Jones.  I have another friend who loves Zeppelin and the solo work as well, but we disagree with this album.  I think it is damn good, some of the songs had to grow on me however.  Sometimes when I got a new Plant solo album, I loved it, other times I needed to get into it.  So my friend likes all of Plant's solo stuff, but admits he had to get into it sometimes, so now I say, Hey, this is like a new Plant album, with one important difference--JIMMY PAGE IS PLAYING GUITAR!!!  if you like these guys, you must own this--I saw the concert twice and was it Zeppelin? NO.  was it incredible music?  HELL YES.
B000059T5O|3.0|I've never heard of the guy [John Hammond] before this CD came out. I'm a Waits fan...a big one. I'm delighted for any exposure his music gets to new crowds. Having said that, I must say I'm not overly impressed. Hammond takes a lot of liberty with the melodies. This isn't, in and of itself, a bad thing, and when it works, as on &quot;Clap Hands&quot; and &quot;Murder in the Red Barn,&quot; it sounds great. The problem, though, is that Hammond misses more often than he hits. &quot;Heartattack and Vine,&quot; for instance, is supposed to be a real fire-in-the-belly kind of song. Perhaps Hammond's rendition is fiery...for him. Tom's broken vocals make this song roar, though, and Hammond just doesn't (or can't) do it. There are a lot of good tracks on this album, but the overall feeling I was left with was very hit-or-miss. I like Tom, and I like the blues, but I think this could have been done better.
B00005R2M3|3.0|I absolutely fell in love with the song &quot;Wherever, Whenever&quot; when I saw the music video on MTV.  The song is catchy, fun, and a great introduction of Shakira to the United States.  I just wish the entire album had been so fresh and fun.<br />Shakira is obviously very talented, but sometimes her raspy voice can get hard to understand.  Many of the songs require looking at the lyrics just to figure out what she is trying to say.  <br />Anyway, I hope that she continues to make music in the English language.  I'm sure that she could be the next Jennifer Lopez or Ricky Martin if she keeps up the good work.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I head these guys on Mancow's morning madhouse. This was the first I had heard of them and it is all good.  To me these guys have that Ramones' adittude, while sounding much more accessable. I am not all that familiar with the Ramones but that is the best compairson I can make. The song writing is great and the delivery is excellent.  They have a sound that is unlike anything out there today.  Perhaps you could say they are a more mature sounding grunge band without all the guilt. When they say &quot;Is this it&quot; all I can say is &quot;this is it&quot;.  It is a bare bones sound that gets right to the music and delivers all the way.
B00004Z459|3.0|Not a bad CD all in all. Some of the songs tend to be formulaic, mellow verse followed by hard guitars and a screaming lead vocalist - Crawling and In the End are proof positive that a hook can sell records. After listening to the record quite a bit I decided that there were 3 songs I really liked that broke from this mold. #2, #7 and #12. The lead singer really does have a good voice but doesn't showcase it except on one track - not sure what's up with that - listen to #12 and you know what I mean. The 'rapping' half of the group has solid lyrics but a monotone delivery that doesn't really do anything but waste time during the verse to make the chorus seem more powerful. I do like how the 2 leads play off each other on some of the tracks, which is what makes this group good in the first place. A focus on better delivery by the rapper and less screaming, more singing by the other lead, and you'll have a 5 star album.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Get this CD...!!!!! Del tha Funkee Homsapien is awesome on tracks 5 and 10. Get this CD!!!!
B000021YQV|3.0|Toxicity rocks. This album different than their debut but just as good if not better.  system of a down are a bit more grown up now and not quite as weird. Prison song and Chop suey! are stand out tracks.<br />Toxicity is well worth the money
B000025J6A|5.0|While I didn't care much for the sound track for &quot;Star Trek, The movie&quot;, the &quot;Inside Star Trek&quot; CD that's ALSO included with this packaged CD set as an &quot;Extra Addition&quot;, is what really in my opinion, makes it WELL worth the purchase price!<br />I loved this recording when I first heard it back in the 1970's, when I got it as a Vinyl LP as part of my Columbia Records Record Club choice of the month, and I STILL love it!<br />Since however, it's hard to find Record Players these days, so that one can play an old style Vinyl LP record Album, I was VERY happy to find that the &quot;Inside Star Trek&quot; recording, had been released again, this time, in the newer CD format.<br />If you are a Star Trek fan, especially of the ST:TOS (Star Trek, The Original Series), this is a definite MUST have!<br />In it you will find out LOADS of interesting tidbits about the Star Trek Universe, right from &quot;The Great Bird of the Galaxy&quot;, Gene Roddenberry's mouth himself!  <br />You will also find out how Spock was conceived, and while he wasn't the first Human/Vulcan conception, he was the first to successfully go from Conception, then to Embryo, and lastly, to viable Baby.  Gene as part of this &quot;discussion&quot;, also has the Actor who played Spock's Father, reprise his role for this recording.  <br />While in Character, he and Gene discuss how Vulcans &quot;Copulate&quot; as well as how long the normal Vulcan Gestation period is, and how Spock was able to actually become the first successful Human/Vulcan hybrid.<br />Gene also talks about his battles with the Sensors, and how he combated them, as well as much, much more.<br />&quot;Inside Star Trek&quot; is a very funny and enlightening CD, and I think all, even Non Trek fans will enjoy it as well.<br />Not only that, but with ST:ENT (Star Trek, Enterprise), the new show that's on, this CD is loaded with Information that will also help you understand Vulcans even more, and how the Star Trek Universe came to be.
0671799320|5.0|This book is a must for anyone working in the oil industry.  Though written early last decade during the Gulf War, much of the discussion and analyses in this book is still relevant today... proving that the old economy - powered by oil - is still very much a force to be reckoned with.
B000002U82|5.0|I remember lying in bed with fever so many years ago back in 1973 when a friend of mine brought me home new LP of Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon and said : &quot; Listen to this ! &quot; I clearly remember I cried when finished listening to it, I cried the tears of happines that something so good came out after a long time. Still have a MFSL vinyl copy and CD too. This is one of the best rock albums EVER released, and after so many years and after hundreds of listenings still sends shivers down my spine when listening to it ! Pure pleasure !
0679777547|2.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. After the first couple of chapters, I realized that I had seen the movie, &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, based on THE CLUB DUMAS. While I found the book enjoyable, especially the descriptive passages on the nature and fascination of books, the passion of imagination and archival treasures, I became confused by the two plot lines.<br />In addition, I was disappointed to learn that the concurrent themes intersected only in the mind of Lucas Corso, the mercenary book detective. All the characters are questing after Satan's secret map to immortality; unfortunately, they are all reduced to self-seeking greed. Unless a reader is curious about Satanism, I wouldn't consider any of the characters remotely interesting, except for Corso.<br />Possibly the only redeeming character was that of Lucas Corso. But his attraction to the young woman posing as his &quot;guard&quot; seems facile and predictable. Ultimately, I was disappointed in the experience, often prefering the movie images to the confusing passages in the novel.
6300184064|5.0|Wow! I love this movie. My all time favorite movie. '1984' done with dark humor by Monty Pythonian Terry Gilliam. Beauracracy run amuk. Futuristic, yet 1940's technology. Paperwork and forms,forms,forms...Robert De Niro as terrorist/air conditioner repairman! Terrorism (the real kind, not the tongue and cheek kind of De Niro's character) that goes almost unnoticed by the well to do who can't be bothered by it, or are just so used to it that they continue with their meal/and the band, though injured, plays on....After Sept. 11th, this takes on new meaning: don't let terrorism become commonplace,as portrayed here,but fight it to knock it out so future generations won't know what it is (hope, pray, support our President and military forces in this most noble of Crusades!).I have seen this movie at least six or seven times, and every time I see it I learn something new or make a new connection or gain a new insight into this great movie. Billboards as scenery hiding the industrial waste, plastic surgery that gruesomely destroys, gazillions of miles of ductwork, mechanical assistance for stenographs (unbelievable what she is recording and is not affected by it,again the numbing of the emotions and mind),dream girl,action and adventure chase scenes, and finally escapism....ahhhhh...Brazil is found......This is a movie that you need to focus 100% of your attention on, ie. put the kids to sleep, grab a beer, and engage your mind. A must,must see!
B000005RFM|4.0|The best thing about the recently remastered version of this<br />album is the inclusion of BLOW ON A JUG, that silly tune that<br />appeared at the end of THE WRIT on the original vinyl pressings<br />of the album.Tis a silly little tune! The worst thing about the<br />remastered version is the lyric sheet, which very annoyingly<br />omits parts of phrases and sentences on half the songs! It's the<br />worst lyric sheet I've ever seen in it's incompleteness!RAAR!<br />  This is a great SABBATH album, tho' it's not one of<br />my favorites by the original line-up. Half the album is absolute-<br />ly wonderful;the heavier half of the album. Songs like HOLE IN<br />THE SKY and THE WRIT and THE THRILL OF IT ALL are all top notch<br />SABBATH songs and rock out heavier than most of the songs from<br />SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH. Also, OZZY OSBOURNE was in top vocal<br />form throughout the album, especially on HOLE IN THE SKY, which<br />features his most angry sounding vocal ever!<br /> The production is a bit over the top , however, with too much<br />keyboards and other junk on some of the songs, like my two<br />least favorite tracks SUPERTZAR and AM I GOING INSANE.<br />  GREAT COVER; doesn't BILL WARD look sexy in them tights?
B00005RFQ5|3.0|Prince has outdone himself musically on this CD.  There is a Miles Davis feel to the intro song, The Rainbow Children.  The combination of Funk, jazz and rock is incredible.  Music just does not get better than this.  But, his lyrics left me hollow.  I, try not to judge people for religion or their beliefs.  Actually, I always respected Princes beliefs and his use of music to get this across.  There have been occasions his music made me feel love for God and a left me happy when I finished listening to the songs.  But The Rainbow Children does not give me that feeling.  Actually it makes me feel like \\"The banished ones\\" on this CD.  He left me behind with his psudo Jehovah Witness preaching's on this album.  I am happy he has found faith and love, but this is his way of going door to door.  Again, I am not bashing any religion or belief.  But, I was disappointed on the direction of this CD.  Prince, if you ever see the reviews, please keep up with the music, but tone down the beliefs.  You are leaving life long fans behind you, who are into the music and the love you gave us.
6305252521|4.0|Ok, this movie is wonderful and it is by far Jim Carrey's best, but where are the extra DVD features? I mean, why is there absolutely nothing? It would be 5 stars if it at least had 1 extra feature.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Michael Bay's latest epic sinks under it's own wright faster than the very ship-cum-movie which is obviously it's model. and whereas James Cameron's epic Titanic was actually involving, Bay's attempt, despite it's best intentions, is uninteresting and undramatic.<br />save, admittably, the highlight of the film - a full 40 minutes of Bay doing what he does best, that is to say, to blow stuff up good - Pearl Harbor is an uneasy drama and a pretty poor romance. it's also a cliched buddy movie from the opening scene, in which an eight year old repeatedly beats a World War I vet with a board and calls him a &quot;dirty German&quot;. we're presented a poor collection of cliched characters - the Unseperable Buddies Who Always Wanted To Fly Bomber Planes, the Beautiful Woman Who Comes Between Them,  the Stuttering Freind, and, yes, even the Token Black Guy. let's not forget the Evil Japanese. with no real back story or intertesting dialouge (most of it is damned laughable), the actors try their best to pull this thing out of the hole it's dug itself. they don't.<br />the story drags itself through beautiful sets without a hint of historical accuracy, through sappy and uninvolving romance, and finally up to 12/7/41, where the film's few pleasures can be found. stuff blows up real good - for over a half hour - and I suddenly found myself interested. regardless of the story that surrounds it, Bay proves here to be an able craftsman with obvious talent for directing stuff blowing up, sinking, crashing, and other forms of mass destruction - one wishes he were given something on the level of, say, Die Hard to work with. but he's not, and ultimatley the action, which takes up only about 21% of the movie's run time, is the only highlight in this amazingly disapointing cinematic train wreck.<br />similarly, following those amazing 40 minutes, there is a third act which feels too tacked-on for it's own good. and don't get me started on the cheesy, cloyingly sentimental and patrioticending, complete with a Very Somber Voiceover, that's supposed to add resonance to the drama. so's the action, but at it's heart this movie is a drama, and it's the damndest most uninteresting drama I've seen in a long time. in an effort to pad out the run time to it's full 3 hours, we're treated to human interaction against a backdrop of stuff blowing up complete with a melodramatic score. even people who didn't like Titanic will see that film's obviously superior execution compared to this mess.<br />Bay proves that he should stick with action. Affleck &amp; Co. prove that even the most capable actors can't save such a poor screenplay. and Bruckheimer proves that he can finance stuff blowing up real good. if you want good action, try Die Hard. if you want good romance, try Titanic. Disney's ad campaign was based on stuff blowing up, and those expecting 3 hours of explosions will be sorely dissapointed. it's more 2 1/2 hours of tedious romance. even the film's obvious interest in becoming what it ultimatley was not and it's action cannot save it.<br />it's not detestable, but it's not interesting. and it's not effective, but it's at least slightly distracting. avoid this padded out and ludicrous excuse for a Very Important Movie.
B00005Q4GA|3.0|Lara Croft--Tomb Raider was one of the most anticipated films of the year. The very idea of taking a video-game and crafting it into a movie took us all by surprise, and once it was announced that Angelina Jolie was casted as the leading lady, that was it: we had to see it. The film, of course, has your stereotypical plot of an action hero (this time female) going on a quest to save civilization. In this case, Croft must stop villains from getting the pieces of a triangle which once led to the destruction of a society and could be used to control the earth and lead to its destruction, if put in the wrong hands. Naturally, lots of stunts, fight-scenes, and narrow escapes ensue before Lara Croft ultimately prevails. There is also a link to Lara's own past, in that she is taking on a mission which her father was unable to fulfill. As his successor, she is determined more than ever to rescue civilization.<br />I found this movie hard to interpret in the sense that it was very unemotional. I associated Jolie with such roles as 'Lisa' from 'Girl, Interrupted' and did not know what to make of her as a cool and collected action queen. Of course, she was fun to watch, but she did not seem to have a lot of lines, and the lines she did have, were often giving instructions or in the middle of fight-scenes. The lack of feeling was disconcerting for me. I understand that it was important to Jolie not to have a female action hero wimpering and being carried off by a man, but surely that is only one emotion that a woman will feel. A lack of humor was keenly felt in this movie. Her English side-kicks only produced luke-warm chuckles, but perhaps this would have been different if the villain had had a couple of dupes for side-kicks.<br />The positives to this movie are self-explanatory. We have a female action-hero who is not afraid to look feminine and have some sex appeal (without falling into the arms of every guy or any guy she lays eyes on.) The violence was not overly graphic and there was hardly any sexuality. I liked the idea of the movie's traveling to Angkor Wat to find the location of the sacred triangle, as this Cambodian location is so beautiful, yet so ignored by Hollywood. And of course, Angelina Jolie is beautiful and absolutely stunning to watch in action. You can rent this movie, enjoy it, but you won't find yourself captivated by it.<br />Over all, a good, even if a little enigmatic, performance by Jolie, some nice scenery, a typical plot, but lacking in emotion or hilarity.
0385334176|4.0|After finishing one of Vonnegut's books, I always like to read essays and critical thought writings on the book. As I began to read some on Deadeye Dick, I realized that most people are morons. It doesn't matter what other people thought the book was about, where the symbols are, or how he meant for things inside it to be taken. Vonnegut himself lends his thoughts to this very idea. Look at the Author's notes at the beginning of the book. He gives a list of symbols that he included in the book. Did he do this for a reason? He certainly did. But in my opinion, and if youve been reading this, you realize it doesnt matter, but in my opinion, it doesnt matter what he thinks the symbols are. It matters how you percieved the opinions, and the way i percieved them is not at all how he did. Sure, he wrote the book, but I read it, and a book unread is useless. Life goes on.<BR>If you like Vonnegut, you'll love Deadeye Dick....
B00003CY5K|5.0|I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said. I loved the movie personally, I needed a good laugh as I am undergoing treatment for breast cancer. I especially loved the chihuahua, and ,yes, I own a chihuahua, and now have ideas on apparel for him. It was just one of those movies that tickles you. If you could use a good laugh I highly recommend this movie.
B00005ATQC|5.0|One of my friends told me that her mother said that this was a bad movie.  Walking out of this movie was an experience that her mother actually had at a movie theater, with a crowd of people watching this movie, and she didn't like it.  I think watching it on tape is a much more private experience, like having secret military tribunals instead of public trials whenever the government is stepping on its illegitimate protuberances.  Part of this movie is some sort of proceeding in which women remove most of what they are wearing, and then Bill is told to take off his mask.  This might be more creepy than secret military tribunals, but the people in this movie didn't claim they had any right to impose the death penalty.  Sometimes people just die.  This movie was made by an old man, and I think it really bothered him when women would rather sleep than do whatever he wanted to do, so the dead woman just represented the way he felt about the number of hours that he has wasted while women were lying around unconscious.  Now that Kubrick is dead, it makes perfect sense for governments to want to have secret military tribunals, because governments like people about as much as Kubrick liked whatever women this movie was about.  There aren't really many dead women in this movie, compared to the number of people that governments have killed, so I'm giving it 5 stars for showing the kind of restraint that great movies excel at having.  I just hope that no movie about secret military tribunals ever gets to be this popular.
0385505833|4.0|I enjoyed the story. It started out a little slow ...seemed alot like reading...&quot;The Christmas Carol&quot;, but midway into the book it really took off. I laughed at every turn of the page until the end! Would make a great 'made for TV' movie!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This DVD is great for all ages.  This classic story will warm the hearts of all who watch it.  The interactive games included on the DVD make you feel like you are on a real Disney World ride.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This most beautiful music sounds wonderful on CD and newly processed stereo tracks. It is clear, crisp, and with that fine Beach Boys touch of stereo clarity. For shortcuts I've been just skipping the old mono version to start things up at track 15 for the enhanced stereo version of this 1966 masterpiece. I guess this is the most magical rock album I've ever heard. Something to experience over and over and over and not tire of it or put it aside for very long. Yeah, this IS all about Rock's 1960s Mozart and this new CD brings it all to life in a big way.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The DVD is even better than the movie itself.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, but the added features (movie clips, behind the scenes, karaoke party, dvd-rom) really make this DVD a must have purchase.
0061091480|5.0|I read this book over ten years ago and it literally changed my life.  I've given this book to many over the years with the same result.  It should be a must read for all.  Don't miss what this book has to offer.  Your rewards will be great!!
B000006OBQ|5.0|This is Sinatra at his best. All of Sinatra's other musical work notwithstanding, this is the quintessential Frank. His voice is dynamic, utterly powerful, unbroken, and also subtly moving throughout the outstanding selection of both standards, and soon-to-be classics.<br />The Count Basie Orchestra, under the direction of the then-newcomer genius Quincy Jones, provides a perfect backdrop: perhaps the best swing group ever assembled. This sound was the heavy-metal of the era. Turn it up.<br />Sinatra, who recreated himself any number of times over the course of his incredible career, reaches his vocal peak in this period. No longer a crooner, and no longer bound by the syrupy strings of Nelson Riddle, Frank unleashes &quot;The Voice&quot; that we now associate with the greatest popular vocalist of the 20th Century.<br />The energy on this record is remarkable for a man of 50 years. Yet, one gets the feeling that Sinatra is only hitting his stride. Basie's brass supports, compliments, and is essential to the effort. Likewise, the arrangements of Jones. This collection's existence is a testimony not only to Frank and the great Count, but to Vegas itself, and the very end of the pre-Beatles era. Forget the so-called &quot;Rat Pack&quot;, because &quot;Sinatra at The Sands&quot; is it. It is a shame that this performance was mostly overlooked in the midst of the heady 1960s. It remains, however (and thank God), for appreciative listeners, both young and older.<br />Frank ruled Vegas and the Sands when this record was cut. That fact comes through loud and clear, as does Mr. Sinatra's seasoned, but perfect, voice. The album was released on Sinatra's Reprise label: in that, Frank gave it his own stamp of approval. Make account of that.<br />There is no need to go about a song-by-song review of the collection. It can easily be said that the entire set is phenomenal and classic. It is a live recording, and there is fault to be found in the low range, but is not at all problematic. It is just as it sounded in the Copa Room at the Sands, just as those who were fortunate enough to have been there heard it.<br />There are some particularly outstanding tunes that deserve note, particularly &quot;My Kind of Town&quot;, &quot;Shadow of Your Smile&quot;, which was brand-new at the time, and the mood-setting opener, &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;. Frank's comedy monologue, as well as the Basie instrumentals round out a truly fantastic thing. Start out your classy New Years Eve Party with this baby.<br />If you're looking for the &quot;real&quot; Frank, the Frank with the rep, this is it. Get behind the wheel of this one. 10 out of 10.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I really did debate on whether to get this or not. I like Pink's old style &amp; how she was always just in your face. What you see is what u get. But, surprisingly, I love this cd just after one listen. I read so many negative reviews on how &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; was the only good track &amp; none of the others even measured up to it. Well, they were wrong. In my opinion, each track has it's own special meaning and scenario. You have to check this out.<br /><br />&quot;Missundaztood&quot;- A wonderful song that teens I think can relate to, adults for that matter. Tne title track is not the best, but it's still really good.<br /><br />&quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;- Some very catchy lyrics &amp; the song is so meaningful &amp; it's true. It sounds great too.<br /><br />&quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;- Prolly the 2nd single from this cd, this track is really great. It also has catchy lyrics &amp; the chorus is just so fun and different, but again, it's ture. I really am liking this song, so I hope it is the the next single.<br /><br />&quot;Get The Party Started&quot;- Alot of us prolly know this one by now, lol. It's not the best, but it is a very good song with a nice beat. It's easily addictive when u need to be cheered up or dance.<br /><br />&quot;Respect (Feat. Scratch)&quot;- Not the best, but this song is really cool. The lyrics are cool &amp; Pink just tells it how it is.<br /><br />&quot;18 Wheeler&quot;- Woah! This song is pretty cool too, tight lyrics. A nice catchy tune.<br /><br />&quot;Family Portrait&quot;- This song is really sad to me how it shows that not every family is perfect &amp; what it feels like to go through such an awful tramadic experience that will affect you for the rest of your life, forever even. A very touching song that makes u understand how hard it is to go through something like that.<br /><br />&quot;Misery (Feat. Steven Tyler)&quot;- This track is very slow, but it's okay, not the best. But overall, this is a nice ballad &amp; it has a very different sound.<br /><br />&quot;Dear Diary&quot;- Omg, alot of people can relate to this. it's about only being able to trust your diary &amp; that being pretty sad. it's about that being the only thing some people can actually talk to.<br /><br />&quot;Eventually&quot;- One of my fave tracks off this album. 'You'll get yours eventually'. So true, I can definetly relate to this song.<br /><br />&quot;Lonely Girl (Feat. Linda Perry)&quot;- Linda Perry does not have very great vocals in my opinion, but this track means alot &amp; is spoken from the heart.<br /><br />&quot;Numb&quot;- Very very slow, but as you can tell by the title, is yet another song about the blues.<br /><br />&quot;Gone To Calfifornia&quot;- I can relate to the 1st part of this track so well, and this is one of my faves also. I love the catchy lyrics &amp; the chorus is really nice.<br /><br />&quot;My Vietnam&quot;- This song is great with the Sep. 11th stuff and all. It's kinda coinsedence she did this before then. it's about how life can be hell, good or bad. It's about being confused. A very great way to end the album, a great track that stands out.<br /><br />Well, I love this CD. The lyrics come in the cd jacket &amp; the pics are awesome. Plus, the enhanced cd features interactive lyrics pages for &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot; &amp; &quot;Get The Party Started&quot;. Plus like 6 photos that are really cool. You can also log onto a private party webpage &amp; view the &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; video &amp; hear a cool special bonus track called &quot;Catch 22&quot;. Don't miss it!<br /><br />So, this cd is awesome. I wouldn't reccomend it to young kids tho for one cos they wouldn't understand the points at all prolly &amp; two, there are some curse words in here. I love it, but I'm talking about like 8 year olds or something. But I guess everyone is different. Adults &amp; teens I think will like this. Don't judge a book by its cover, really try this.llad &amp; it has a very different sound.<BR><BR><BR>&quot;Dear Diary&quot;- Omg, alot of people can relate to this. it's about only being able to trust your diary &amp; that being pretty sad. it's about that being the only thing some people can actually talk to.<BR><BR><BR>&quot;Eventually&quot;- One of my fave tracks off this album.

6305922756|5.0|Finaly, A DVD adds up to the great film.  <br />Lets start with the fim itself.<br />Spinal Tap is a rare comic gem.  A masterpeice if you will.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a real documetury.  It's shot just like what.  And it demenstartes how a rock band would act back stage.  For instance, Nigel (Guitarist) complains about how small his bread is and that he wants it bigger.  And when Spinal app can't figure out where the heck the stage is.<br />The Extras are amazing.  The commentery is very funny, with the actors portraying themselves as the characters. Even though this great, I would like it if they included a commentery with the rea actors.<br />The 70 minutes worth of deleted scenes are great as well.  They add much to the plot are actualy funnier than what appears in the film.<br />The rest are music videos are entertaining and the commercials for &quot;Rock and Rolls&quot; are odd, but ae funny.
0385505833|5.0|I thought this book was very funny.  Just what is needed for a good laugh this season.  I hope he writes more!!
0440219078|5.0|This book is about Jonas who lives in a community where there is no pain and the community is all flat. No one can see colors and there is one person that keeps track of all the memories. That person is &quot;The Reciever&quot;. Jonas has a friend, Asher, who is a wild kid. Every December there is a ceremony like a birthday because you turn a different age. Each time you turn a different age you get something or something happens to you. When you turn 9 you get a bicycle and when you turn 12 you get your assignment. An assingment is the job that you will do for the rest of your life until you retire. They chose the assingment from the volunteer hours to do. For example if you do a lot of volunteering at the Nuturing Center your assingment will probably be Nuturer. Each child has a number at the ceremony which is the order they will be called up. The Cheif Elder skips Jonas's number then comes back to it. Jonas wasn't assinged, he was selected to be &quot;The Receiver&quot;. He gets trained by the old receiver, which Jonas calls &quot;The Giver&quot;, and gets to hold the memories. The Receiver is greatly honored because he can make decisions from past memories. Jonas gets the happy memories, but remembers the Cheif Elder saying that there would be pain so asks the Giver to give him memories with pain. During his training he sees colors for the first time and feels pain for the first time. Jonas's father is a Nuturer and he has to make a release. A release is releasing someone to another community. He watches the release and finds out that his father just kills the baby. Jonas runs away from the community and on his journey he feels pain, sees colors and sees hills. He also hears music which The Giver told him about.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and simply wonderful through and through!  It is an informal and clever treatise on how individuality and one's true personality and zest for life can be construed as being 'sinful' or 'wrong' by some fundamentalist...As a longtime freethinking agnostic with my own beliefs about the meaning of life and how to live it properly, the film reminded me of how so many fanatics have tried to ram their own religion and agenda down my throat over the years...You know, the Greeks have a saying, which loosely translated means \\"too much Kyrie Eleyson even God tires of\\", which in essence, could be the underlying philosophical theme of this phenomenal movie.  If you value individuality and your own personal beliefs and convictions, don't miss this milestone of a movie!  In my opinion, the year's BEST film easily!
B00003CXXJ|3.0|Shrek wasn't a bad movie, however it didn't live up to my expectations. After waiting in line for 10 minutes to get into the movie, a sitting in an extremely crowded theater, I was anxious to see the movie. <br />\\"Shrek\\" strarted out really funny. There were many fantasy characters being locked away such as snow white and the twelve dwarfs, fairies, etc. The donkey (eddie m.) tries to get away and runs into Shrek.  The humans try and catch the donkey, but Shrek is right there and they are scared and run away. The donkey and Shrek eventually become friends ( even after Shrek repeated many times to the donkey that he wasn't looking for any friends). The King of the land orders that Shrek's land will be taken away and the only way for Shrek to save it is to go on an adventure to save a princess (cameron d.) From here the hole story seems to slow down and not much happens. You can probably imagine...<br />Well the movie was still pretty good, and I recommend you to see it. (There is also a small twist at the end; I won't tell you what it is :)
B00000637V|4.0|Lou Reed's &quot;Berlin&quot; is perhaps the drakest album of a career full of less than happy music.  It is a song cycle about a drug addicted couple (Jim and Caroline) and their slow chemical destruction.  It is also one of Reed's most theatrical pieces of rock music, and whether you like it or not will largely depend on whether you like the style in which it was recorded.<br />The album starts slowly, and really doesn't get rolling until the fourth song, &quot;Caroline Says,&quot; an excellent rocking number.  The next cut, &quot;How Do You Think it Feels?&quot; is one of the best songs of Reed's career.  From there, the story REALLY gets ugly, and the most harrowing moment is and the end of the song &quot;The Kids,&quot; in which Reed sings the line, &quot;They're taking my children away,&quot; while the sounds of kids crying and screaming &quot;Mommy!&quot; fill the background.  By the time you get to mournful but beautiful &quot;Sad Song&quot; at the end, you are exhausted.<br />Overall, &quot;Berlin&quot; is one of Reed's best solo albums, but you don't want to put in on if you're feeling suicidal.
B000055WIQ|5.0|I originally saw this movie in college and its impact was long lasting.  Never had I, nor any of my friends, been impacted so greatly by a movie.  Luckily, I was wearing a strong shirt - without realizing it, I had a death grip on my shirt as my sweaty right hand gripped and pulled throughout most of the movie.<BR>   The flashes of evil cast an eerie spell on everyone who dared watch.  College atheletes, who weren't afraid of anything, were afraid to open shower curtains as their imaginations got the best of them.  There weren't even any shower scenes, ala Psycho.<BR>   If you've never seen the full, uncut version of this flick, you owe it to yourself to buy it (or rent it) and get the scare of your life.<BR>   I own my version, but it's not for sale.<br />GKS:  Syracuse University Class of 1975
B000002LQD|4.0|Lou Reed has always been better at tackling deep subjects, such as drug abuse and sexual depravity, than lighter ones.  On &quot;Magic and Loss,&quot; he tackles his deepest subject yet, death by cancer.  Two of Reed's friends succomed to the disease, and this album is his tribute to them.  It is a difficult album to listen to, but one that is worth the effort.  The second track &quot;What's Good,&quot; is the catchiest and probably most well-known number.  From there, many of the songs feature Reed's trademark talk-singing.  The lyrics are often quite poetic, with references to things like &quot;The Sword of Damocles,&quot; and the &quot;Power and Glory,&quot; two of the other song titles.  It also includes strange stuff, like &quot;Harry's Circumcision,&quot; about a guy who tries to alter his appearance with a straight razor.<br />Overall, I would recommend this album most strongly to Reed fans, since it is perhaps a bit too ecclectic for most casual listeners.
6305648522|5.0|humorous, sentimental, and touching film. subtitles easy to follow for those who do not enjoy reading your movie  but this is absolutely worth it.  beautiful music .....must see it.
B00005JKES|5.0|...a grandiose THANK YOU to the man who began molding my already 'warped' sense of creativity at the ripe old age of 12 when Twin Peaks aired for the first time!  i am so incredibly excited to FINALLY be able to own this collection in the version it deserves to be in, so that i can share it with my friends and family who weren't as privileged as i was to see it then. (can you believe there are people who missed it?!)  and to those who were concerned about the pilot episode not being included, nor being released on DVD, check out ...(you can get a dvd version shipped from hong kong)...the pilot's exclusion is definitely NOT a reason to miss out on owning this incredible collection that has forever left me jaded.  barring a few exceptions, the past 12 years have been hard-pressed to produce quality like this...i would really have to say that my introduction to David Lynch through Twin Peaks is responsible for encouraging me to think, and permanently take up residence outside of the box...(maybe i was just at an impressionable age!).  in short...DAMN fine 'movie'...
0385491026|2.0|Reading Margaret Atwood -her work, the \\"cats eye\\" was emotive in a vituperative out pouring of all that wants to be seemingly human and ratiocinatively inhuman in torrents that assemble through the whip of the persona in fragment. <BR>Novel plods warily, through characters in the guise of the selves. Ambi-orthodoxy of the characters insitu, is grudgingly carried on through discontinuities, leaving the stream of narratives palpitating in discontent. Time seethes through abstractions of vertigo, hanging individual particles to a levy a trend that stays on in a momentum of individuations.<BR>There is a pressurized attack to transport the present in abject shocks of being humans, levitating back to a slow development of the past, leaving the beginning so startling and then again leaving the place mellow in a beginning.<BR>The consonants of being filially attached to a brilliant paternity and a subdued maternity impinge the elan of growing up to a matrix, which traces the leftovers of what's absorbed in a normative. <BR>The vacuum of a needy person wanting to fill a myth to relate the entirety of the self is subverted to an attachment, which tags on to the friend's anglicanised form of worship. The aversion to it forms the terra-incognito of the conscious below thresholds.<BR>The repression of the native psyche allegorises the Risleyian development to the `still of life'. Is life ever still?? No it isn't! Every still is moving. The movement is vicarious in dialogues of celebration. The angst of growing up as a body, to be in a body, to be a body is thwarted in sublimity to subliminal intrusions that stay subdued and the torrent in ferment is forever going on as stills.<BR>The body never grows up-only the art does and warps into the canvas as tangled intimations of childhood, maturing the pubic to shades of a black Diaspora.<BR>Its disheartening to probe the stellar pores of the male psyche as they tend to stereotype a tendency that atrophies in intellections, objective and diffident to the within and to objectives that divine the anthropomorphic into impastos of arresting Oedipus's.<BR>Cosmological nuances and body hermeneutics mingle in aberrations, which keep jutting, thrusting and opening the body into art psychic. It's ironic in jestor-ship to obliterate the ballocks to gyenopathic angst's in simulation.<BR>From a sudden juxtaposition of the present, there's a shallow mellowing into the past with patches of present in between. The narratives in earlier development lead the reader guessing, at some point of time later on there would be a momentous union of Cordeila and Risley. But it does not turn out that way and leaves their meeting point as a plot left over in indigestion. <BR>The denouement of signification is rather natural in course as though nothing has happened. The only twist of a difference is Stephen's tragic death so unnatural as it stands out quite raving and different from the whole novel. <BR>Stephen's descent into eternity to be particles of after life is a mausoleum of digression and existing forever as a story quite different in rite. Whether they add on or diminish the periphery is mooted to introspection.<BR>Risley's development into an avant-gardist is buildgrunsroman in effort and kunstlerroman in effect. `Still Life' is an era wanting to refract in a subjective mortality of being frozen but chaotic and moving to the intimate that wants the immortal
B00005N9CV|2.0|Great songs, beautifully lush arrangements, subtle rhythms...unfortunately, the singer seems to have phoned in her performance.  Her delivery is, for the most part, flat and lifeless, without any of the spark she showed on previous albums.   Maybe she's tired from touring too much, but there's no reason to try to sell a bad performance.<br />If Ms. Krall has any respect for her fans, she'd have a cup of coffee and rerecord her vocal part for this CD.
B00004TH83|5.0|Once you listen to the first track Adagio, you will know why this chanteuse is so loved by the world. Her break in the US market didn't come this year but I am certain her next release will catapult her to major stardom domestically. Her hit single I will love again is a great song but does not showcast her abilities to interpret every lyric with passion. Just listen to the audio track samples and buy this CD to check her out, you will not regret it and will definitely become a new fan. I certainly have!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Well I'm so glad I bought this and really can't skip a single song. I had heard &quot;GET THIS PARTY STARTED&quot; and fell in love. Pink's new album is even better than her first one last year. I recommend this to anybody looking for some good tunes full of passionate lyrics.<br />1. M!SSUNDAZTOOD - I love this song, very catchy and upbeat. Love the end skit. 4 stars out of 5<br />2. DON'T LET ME GET ME - Very rockish, with a electric guitar and very strong vocals that stand out. 4 stars out of 5<br />3. JUST LIKE A PILL - OMG I love this song!!! Nice opening. 5 stars out of 5<br />4. GET THIS PARTY STARTED - Sooooo catchy! Anybody who can't get pumped up with this must be dead. I'm lovin the electronica and hip-hop mix, kinda Madonna ish. 5 out of 5<br />5. RESPECT (FEAT. SCRATCH) - Wow Pink pulls off another great dance song, with a awesome beat and incredible messege! It samples the &quot;R-e-s-p-e-c-t&quot; chorus of Aretha Franklin's 60's hit. 4 out of 5<br />6. 18 WHEELER - Your upbeat rock-pop. Love the guitar. 4 out of 5<br />7. FAMILY PORTRAIT - This is a niiice song. It has a rap feel, but not too much. Sad, sad, lyrics that make you think about divorce &amp; broken homes. 5 out of 5<br />8. MISERY (FEAT. STEVEN TYLER) - They sound soooo good together!!!! I couldn't believe, its' like they should have recorded from the start! 5 out of 5<br />9. DEAR DIARY - Kind of reminds me of Fiona Apple's 1997 hit &quot;Criminal.&quot; Love the hypnotic beat. 5 out of 5<br />10. EVENTUALLY - A slow paced ballad with strings. Its about revenge on people who try to use Pink and turn their back on her. 4 out of 5<br />11. LONELY GIRL - Nice rock song. The most classical rock song, as it has a Beatles 60's era sound to it. 4 out of 5<br />12. NUMB - Hard femme rock at its best. Love it. 5 out of 5<br />13. GONE TO CALIFORNIA - A very sad, slow ballad about how bad of a shape Philadelphia is in. Nice melody. 5 out of 5<br />14. MY VIETNAM - A great rock tune about Pink's confusing life and wars. 5 out of 5
B00003CXTG|2.0|Does anyone understand the title of this movie?  The main idea of the story isn't even about Pearl Harbor... its about two friends in the military; with a twisted love story mixed in.  The actually Pearl Harbor scene didn't take up much of the movie's plot, just a fraction of the time... and the movie is made to seem to be dragged on.  But I guess what do I expect... this is a hollywood film.<BR>If your expecting this movie to be a war movie (like I was), then you'll be disapointed... but if you want to see a drama/romance, then you'll probably enjoy it.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This might just be the best movie I've ever seen (and I can't stop listening to the album). Hedwig's story is hilarious, tragic and emotionally moving. Although the plot might seem a bit strange when described, somehow I feel like I love and know Hedwig, and I root for her to find herself-her missing half. John Cameron Mitchell gives a WONDERFUL acting performance and Michael Pitt is deliciously vacant as Hedwig's rock star love Tommy Gnosis. I've seen the film twice so far and am not the least bit sick of it. I could watch it 1000 more times. I wish there could be a sequel. Do yourself a favor and watch his film. The lines alone that you will take away from it are worth the price.
0385505833|4.0|It is a wonderful and actually very funny Christmas Story which you won't want to put it down once you reach chpt. 11/12. I had to pass it on to my relatives so they could enjoy this fun loving story. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Happy Holidays!
B000002IZM|5.0|I bought this CD one day. I saw the movie few times ago but I hesitated for a long time to buy the disc because I was afraid of disappointment. At the beginning, the only track I was listening to was &quot;Rachel's song&quot;. Then, I began to appreciate it and now I love it. One night, I listened to it from the beginning and I woke up at the middle of &quot;End title&quot;. It was so relaxing that I fell asleep!<BR>Well let's talk about this album. All I can say is that this album is a jewel. The music is intense, deep, very emotive with its mix of futuristic and ethnic (mid-eastern) tunes.<BR>The album begins with the dark &quot;Main title&quot;, where Deckard analyzes a picture.<BR>Then there's a transition to the second title which is a dialog between Rachel, Deckard and Tyrell. After it, the music goes on.<BR>The fourth track (Rachel's song) is for me the most simple and the most emotive. It begins with the sound of the wind blowing then slowly, you hear a small tinkling that gets louder and give the rythm of the song. After it, a high-pitched, full-bodied female voice begins to vocalize....... MY FAVORITE!!!<BR>To make short, Vangelis made a beautiful soundtrack. I'm among those who think that this is not only a soundtrack but also one of the numerous masterpieces of Vangelis. The genius idea was to make the tracks follow each other without interruption.<BR>The only thing that sucks was to put &quot;One more kiss, dear&quot;. I think that this Roaring Twenties-like song doesn't have its place in this album with futuristic music cause it breaks the slow-paced rythm of the disc.<BR>To finish, I have to say that this album is very relaxing. Put the CD in your player, set the volume so that it's neither too loud nor too low, lower the light or light a candle and listen to it as your lie in the dark on the sofa and........enjoy...........
B00005QZWI|5.0|As a new reader of the Tolkein books with the new onslaught of hipe of them since the release of the movie...I came across this cd and fell absolutely in love with it. It has the placid melodies of the nationally acclaimed Enya, and new songs under the direction of Howard Shore. I am not a big cd buyer but I certainly recommend this one. You won't regret it! I give it the Johanna seal of approval!
B00005R2M3|5.0|This CD is an awesome latin CD. No matter What kind of music you like, Shakira will be on the top of your Christmas List this year. So get out and buy it before I buy them all!!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|Visual effects and Battle footage were great...the other 85% of the movie was just lousy fluff...
B00005QHSS|5.0|This CD is just incredible. I am a &quot;special edition lover&quot; and this is the most beautiful CD I've ever seen!!!some special edition CDs just have an idiot little paper around the classic CD box and a sticker saying &quot;special limited edition bla bla bla&quot;...and have one bonus track not even printed on the cover... but this one is: 1.a double CD 2.a special digipack in red(original is green) with the Rammstein &quot;R logo&quot; in 3D on it 3.a special red cd cover 4.a special Tour Edition cover for 2nd CD 5.the music is fantastic. This is not a CD, this is a piece of A R T !!! If u r a Rammstein listener of if u know someone who is, get this for him and you'll be praised forever!!!
0393312836|4.0|It is hillarious what Mr. Burgess made of the language in the book. Most of those words are Englishised Russian words or Russianized english words. The book itself, although really violent, has great philosophical value and should be considered a classic.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you love a romantic tale then 'Pride and Prejudice' is for you.  This updated version on DVD captures Jane Austen's story in all its glorious detail.  This amusing tale takes hold of you from the beginning as it chronicles the lives of the Bennet family and the nuances of 19th century British society.  I defy you not to love the sassy, independent heroine Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Bennet (played by Jennifer Ehle) and the brooding, prideful hero Mr. Darcy (played by Colin Firth) as they spar off in this classic story of misunderstandings and true loves.
B00005LB50|3.0|This box set has two CD's more than necessary.  Several of these songs are repeated two to three times!  After owning this box set for a few weeks, I decided to make my own compilation and burn it onto a CD.  I only needed TWO 80 minute cd's to fit every single unique song (no duplicate songs), without leaving anything out.  It's just startling that there is so much duplication on this box set when there are still tracks missing from &quot;Last Time Around&quot;!
0061020680|4.0|After reading the first three books, I knew I liked Terry Pratchett. So my brother bought me Mort at a book store. It is the first in the Death subseries of the Discworld series. This one had more Discworld &quot;feel&quot; than Equal Rites. But it is not as good as &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, my favorite so far. This book is about Death's apprentice, Mort, who takes over while Death finds ways of having Fun. Some of the scenes with Cutwell the wizard are funny, and Rincewind makes a brief appearence. I liked the duel between Death and Mort, and there were many truly funny scenes in Mort. But it was not my favorite. My order, from best to worst, of the ones I read are: 1. Light Fantastic 2. Equal Rites 3. Mort 4. Color of Magic
B00005OM4N|5.0|Here is a song-by-song review of this album:<br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U - I didn't like it at first but it's grown on me. It is definitely a groundbreaking song for her. 4 stars out of 5<br />2. Overprotected - Wow! This is my favorite song on the album. Britney shows she has definitely grown since her last album and tells us she's not a little girl anymore. The song is irresistibly catchy pop. 5 stars<br />3. Lonely - A great, funky, R&amp;B-inflected song. Again, Britney wants us to know she's independent. 5 stars<br />4. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet A Woman - This is Britney's only ballad on the album. It's a power ballad, not too sappy. I used to think she couldn't sing ballads. After hearing this song, I changed my mind. 4.5 stars<br />5. Boys - At first when I heard this song, I didn't like it at all. The next time, I liked it more, and it is still growing on me. It's really funky, kind of R&amp;B-like. 5 stars<br />6. Anticipating - This sounds like a Janet song, in a really good way. I immediately loved it and still do. 5 stars<br />7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll - I don't really like this cover.  It's mundane and kind of boring. 2 stars<br />8. Cinderella - Again, Britney stresses wanting to be independent. This song is totally awesome. 5 stars<br />9. Let Me Be - I had the pleasure of hearing this song before Britney's album came out - it's on the &quot;On The Line&quot; soundtrack which I highly recommend to anyone who likes pop music. &quot;Let Me Be&quot; is yet another pop song in which Britney lets us know she is independent. This is one of the best songs on the album. 5 stars<br />10. Bombastic Love - This song is a little bit slow-moving in my opinion but still good. 4 stars<br />11. That's Where You Take Me - A midtempo song that is strangely soothing and makes me sleepy. It's pretty good and really sweet. 4 stars<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me - This song is no less than irresistible! It's easily the edgiest song on the album. Justin's vocals make it even moreedgy. 5 stars<br />Britney's first two CD's were guilty-pleasure albums. This one is a little less guilty and a lot more pleasure.
0071373586|3.0|A lot of interesting anecdotes and good points made by the authors.  Definitely useful to help one market their product, service, and company -- and themselves.  At one point a situation is being discussed and it is written that doing such and such would violate the number one rule of positioning theory.  What are these rules, I don't see a list in this book.  There are a lot of thought-provoking examples, which is great, but would have liked it all pulled together and summarized better.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Though 15 years has passed, this movie has not met a match. It is an unforgettable and moving story of human kind.
6302794331|5.0|Purists will cringe, but this is one of the best Christmas Carol productions ever, for either kids or adults. The Muppet ghosts are truly phenomenal--the Ghost of Christmas Present, especially, is wonderful. Michael Cane gives an uncharacteristically muted performance. The humor is all-over-Muppets, irreverent and pushing artistic liscence to the utter limit. But Dickens, I think, would grin; it's just up his alley.<br />The standout performances are Meredith Braun as Belle and the musical score by the very underrated American composer, Paul Williams. Braun sings Williams' ravishing song, &quot;When Love Is Gone&quot;, with a coiled tension that's operatic, and when Michael Cane haltingly joins her at the end, every adult will recall their own lost loves with an aching heart. There won't be a dry eye in your house. <br />There's enough goofy fun, literary puns, and excellent &quot;casting&quot; to please adult and kid alike (the rag-and-bone man who buys Scrooge's still-warm blankets is a grasping spider in a Victorian stovepipe hat...and the wheedling women who steal Scrooge's bed-clothes are bedbugs...I think!), but what'll keep this Muppets movie on your shelf long after the kids have moved on is the genuine portrayal of adult guilt and redemption. Which is, after all, the whole point of Christmas.
0804106304|4.0|At first, I saw the movie a year ago. Then, i had to read the book for my english poject.  I really enjoyed the book because I did not have trouble getting to learn and keeping up with all eight characters. I understood their relationships in this book. How? I think it is because I can relate to the book. My mother is the same way with her children. She pushes and pushes us to go to school and be a &quot;doctor.&quot;  The mothers of this story strongly encourage their daughters to be their best. They mainly do this because they pay most of their attention to what the other women think.  There is also a competition within each and everyone of the main characters. They strive at being the better chinese mother. By doing this, they put their daughters in a lot of stress.  Each set of mother and daughter have their own separate story to tell. All of the mothers in this story are part of a group called &quot;Joy Luck Club.&quot; I titled this review, not just a &quot;girly&quot; book, because many people have the impression that this is a book preferably read by females. It is not true because I am coninced thea more guys should read this book and hopefully learn something from this.  I definitely learned alot by reading this novel.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I liked the old ones a lot, and when I heard about Episode 1, 2 and 3 I was very exited, I bought my ticket one week before. I was happy, but then the movie started and, dear God. What was George Lucas thinking. The movie is way TOOOO infantile, what was the point of putting such an painful character as Jar Jar Binks, the worst chracter ever. And, no villan what so ever, if you have a character like Darth Maul, use it, make it talk, but not hide it, I remember the good old Darth Vader, but in this movie he was a way to merry little kid, even in movies children can be good characters, not some Cartoon Network wannabe's. The story has always been good, but, don't spoil it George, I hope the next two episodes are better, and please...Dont destroy your empire Mr. Lucas, you could have done a lot better. But until you do, as another customer said, shove all this childish nonsense up your Jar Jar Binks and give us the dark and serious Star Wars like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, the best Star Wars.
0790729628|3.0|Initially, I was glad this DVD was not the version of Blade Runner containing the Harrison Ford voice-over, which I feel ruined the film when it was originally released in theaters. I dislike the voice-over version, and the version minus the voice-over is one of my all time favorite films. Rumors were that the emotionless voice-over Ford gave, he gave intentionally because he disapproved of it. Done properly, it might have worked, but Ford's served only as a simplistic explanation of the storyline for the viewers, treating them as children, rather than giving the &quot;Marlowesque&quot; feel supposedly originally intended. This is probably due to the fact that the voice-over was finally added only after participants in test screenings complained of being confused by the storyline. The omission of the voice-over, leaving the events in the film to tell the story, allows the film to be the visual masterpiece it deserves to be. However, given Blade Runner's reputation for visuals, I purchased this DVD expecting to be able to view Blade Runner in widescreen or letterbox format. I never considered that someone would release this visual classic on DVD and not include a letterbox format for conventional TV monitors. But this DVD is only in &quot;anamorphic&quot; format. This apparently means you can't view the film in widescreen unless you own a widescreen TV, because the image or picture is stretched to fit your TV screen. For me, this makes the DVD a major disappointment.
6305265666|5.0|I always seem to get lost in this one!  I loved it the first time I saw it, and still do.  I just requested it on DVD since I no longer have a VCR and am not able to watch it.<br />My husband even watches it!!
B00005NKKY|5.0|Perhaps S &amp; G here were trying to tell a life story between the BOOKENDS from birth &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot; to the near end &quot;Old Friends&quot;...One line from the latter song &quot;How terribly strange to be seventy&quot;, I have remembered from time to time when seeing older people over the years,but now,of course,the age of 70 does not seem strange at all! &quot;America&quot;,tells a fine road story,and has always been one of my all-time favorites. I still don't know if &quot;Mrs. Wagner's Pies&quot; is a real brand! &quot;Overs&quot; has a folk-jazz feel that makes it,and many of S &amp; G's tunes, more interesting by far than much folk/pop of the time,or since.&quot;Fakin It&quot;,and &quot;Punky's Dilemma&quot;, a whimical look at the serious topic of draft dodging at the time,are equally good.&quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; is one of the few fast moving folk-rockers that I've ever enjoyed. &quot;At the Zoo&quot; is amusing,but not the type of song you'll want to hear over and over. Ditto for &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, a phenomenal hit at the time,but not one of my favorites. It is for me the only dud on the record,but did it ever get this duo into the big-time!! Bottom line,a timeless pop masterpiece,which I would put right next to the Beatles' REVOLVER, and the BeachBoys PET SOUNDS as the very best late 60's pop/rock!
B00005R87Q|5.0|Sweet movie. If u like cars u'll like this. ITs more of a movie for teens. Heard alot of old people didnt like it
B000003N89|4.0|A very high four-star for Diana,but just not her top effort. I prefer her ballads which,even more than the nifty swing numbers,are a fine tribute to Mr. Cole. She does the best &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dream&quot; I've heard,slow and moody.&quot;You're Looking at Me&quot; is also unbeatable,though truthfully I've never heard the Cole version.&quot;A Blossom Fell&quot;,and &quot;If I Had You&quot; are very nicely done here as ballads,the latter even better than the ballad version by Mr. Sinatra himself! Make no mistake! Diana's building up a terrific career,and we can hope she'll keep at it for a long while...PS-If you have a chance,check up on yesterday's New York Times Arts section,with an article about Diana and others who are keeping the great song tradition alive!!
0060254920|5.0|I read &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; to my sister in the sixties, to my three children in the seventies, and to my grandchildren in the new millenium.  It is a favorite of all.  My son is so fond of it he asked me to give a copy to his son for Christmas.
B000002UB3|4.0|Yes, I'm one who as a raw youth listened many ,many times to SIDE TWO of ABBEY ROAD in some amazement, since it was a new sound,each track sliding into the next with some smart rhythms,nifty harmonies (as on &quot;Sun King&quot;), and wry humor, very rare in rock then, and even more so now.But in the past thirty years, I have listened (and played) many other types of music: Broadway,Pop,Jazz,Swing,Classical,among others. Now as a semi-grizzled case,SIDE TWO seems a little childish,which was always part of it's charm,but now at times can get underwhelming.SIDE ONE I always thought so-so, though &quot;Maxwell's Hammer&quot;,and to a lesser extent,&quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;,maintain a certain breezy &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; feel.&quot;Something&quot; may be the best love ballad of 1969-70,but,given the competition,that's not saying too much. The rest of SIDE ONE is overdone basic rock, retreaded under a different brand name, thousands of times to no real avail. Yes, the Beatles are still the best rock band of them all yet who,for an aging fan, do not often go beyond the youth audience,even on ABBEY ROAD. The one album that does stretch the Beatles' into  more timeless territory for all ages is &quot;Revolver&quot; , my pick for the Beatles' best,and really among the great albums of 20th Century popular song and music,not just &quot;Rock&quot; albums.
B000002IV8|3.0|i,m sorry... thats all i can say. im probably the biggest overkill fan in the world......and when i say this i mean it. first of all this album could never be compared with any other trash outfit out there. why? because this aint no trashmetal album. this is more likely to be considered as a heavy metal album than any other thing. sorry guys but if you are a die hard trash fan....and u want to get into overkill....this is not the right way to start. try horrorscope for instance. i considerer this album as being like the &quot;load-reload&quot; (metallica) in overkill history......but dont get me wrong this is not a bad album at all, but its just not great .....in fact is my least favorite of all..and they have a lot. i like w.f.o ten times more than this one, even the killing kind..........try their early efforts like the years of decay or taking over.....thoes i can stand for.<BR>this album is quite slow, and maybe too boring compared with any other overkill releases.
0671015206|2.0|This book is just as advertised but very boring to me.  I was amazed by many of the little factoids sprinkled throughout the book.  However, I quickly lost interest and never could bring myself to finish it.  I think the information is valuable but I had a hard time staying intterested once I decided that I did not accept the authors definition of wealth.  I found &quot;wealth&quot; in the authors view, to be very stringent and constricting and it flew in the face of one truly enjoying life.  But if you are interested in seeing into the mind of an owner of local pizza shops, who drives the same car he drove in 1972, then this is the book for you.
6300248569|5.0|Maybe because I saw this version first (before the 1996 version), but I prefer this one.  The actress that plays Elizabeth is excellent.  I like her Elizabeth much better than the 1996 Elizabeth.  Although I love Colin Firth (he's a hottie), I like the way that David Rintoul plays Mr. Darcy.  He comes off cold at the right times and warms up when he wants to - just as I imagine that Mr. Darcy would.  The production isn't as impressive, but if you like P&amp;P, give this version a look.<br />When will they put this on DVD?
0451191153|4.0|I loved this book yet I felt I did not fully understand the message she was trying to convey.  Beautifully written and very entertaining, I read this many years ago and I only read around bedtime so I may have missed some of her point by being young and/or not fully concentrating in some parts.  Without the benefit of a professor or Teaching assistant to discuss this book with I somehow felt dumb for not completely getting it.  But still I would highly recommend it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't understand how anyone can say that this cd isn't good! I think that John Mayer is the greatest guitarist/songwriter I've heard in a long time. I like the mix of jazz, blues, light rock and man can this guy play the acoustic guitar. I don't think he sounds like Dave Matthews, not that I don't like Dave, but I think that John Mayer is pretty different. A good cd, with many good songs, Neon was the one that first got me hooked and the rest came along not far behind... let John Mayer take you for a ride... you won't be disappointed.
0446310786|5.0|I thought I would hate this book because most &quot;GOOD BOOKS&quot; are books that I hate.  But after reading this for my Junior Honors English class, I found that I liked it a lot.
630310696X|4.0|Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, and director Johnathan Demme more than deserve the accolades received for this story of a gay, AID-stricken attorney who sues the lawfirm that unjustly fires him; in fact, Demme and his cast are so incredibly good that you won't realize how one-dimensional the script is until you've had time to recover yourself after the film's powerful conclusion.<br />The problem with the script, at least as I see it, is that PHILADELPHIA is written in such a way as to create maximum identification with and sympathy for Hanks, and in consequence it never goes any further than it absolutely must into the myriad of issues swirling around the AIDS epidemic; there is no real effort to look beyond the the deliberately glossy, upper-middle-class surface the film posits as reality.  Well intentioned, no doubt, but the film never actually makes a viable statement of any kind.<br />Even so, Hanks, Washington, and the astonishingly gifted cast turn PHILADELPHIA into a powerfully emotional experience, and that alone is more than worth the price of admission.  Strongly recommended--but if you're looking for more in an AIDS-related film than an exercise in catharsis, you may be disappointed.
0385505833|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book, and I liked it a lot. It is relatively short which is nice because you can get through it quickly and move onto another book.<br />  The story was very entertaining and can get you in the Christmas spirit.<br />  About three quarters of the way through the book, I thought I was not going to like the ending; however, the ending turned out to be wonderful and very heartwarming. The book can remind us all of the true meaning of Christmas.
B00004W221|5.0|I think I've seen this movie 100 times, and I have to admit that I never get tired of watching it. This DVD is obviously not for insensitive morons like the guy that gave this 1 star. But, I can tell you that if you coach sports, play in them, or  are at all involved in them...you will want to buy this. <br />A guy said that he doesn't understand why Rudy wanted to play at Notre Dame so much? What about you? Have you never had a dream before? I understand why he did want so much to play at Notre Dame, and any other person can see that too. OK now time for my actual review of the movie:<br />I thought that this movie was very well-directed, and inspiring. I cried at the end of this movie, and I guarentee if you play sports you will as well. If not tears, you will get chill bumps just watching the end. It's about young man that has always wanted to play football for Notre Dame, but was always too small to. It's a long and meaningful story, but I don't want to spoil anything for you ...you have to get that experience when you see it.<br />Please buy this DVD. It is really a great and inspiring movie and I'm sure that you will like it.<br />HIGHLY RECCOMENDED
B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;O.K. Computer&quot; is the definitive masterpiece of the 90s and it may very well be the most influential album to come out since the Beatles made records. No other modern band has influenced so many bands on both sides of the Atlantic, and this album is their bonafide masterpiece.<br />From the opening track, 'Airbag,' this album probes the depths of man vs. technology. The classic Radiohead guitars are present throughout and notably on 'Paranoid Android,' one of the most brilliant songs ever recorded. The time changes are shattering and the arrangement is exquisite. It would be easy to dissect each songs on the album, but in the interest of time and space it should be said that 'Let Down' is probably the definitive song in expressing the overall theme of the album. The keyboards swirl and the guitars layer the sound. 'Climbing up the Walls' is simply disturbing in depicting absolute paranoia. There are catchier tunes here like 'No Surprises' and 'Karma Police' but they all function withing the concept of the album, a rare feat indeed. <br />&quot;O.K. Computer&quot; is not a particularly accessible album, but it gets better with every listen. One cannot conceive of the past four years worth of innovative music without hearing this; it is the supreme blueprint for its' time just as &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; were for the 60s. Absolutely essential for any serious music collection.
B00004Z459|5.0|If you don't own this album, you are missing out on some great music by an amazing band. I bought this CD many many months ago, and I still have to listen to it everyday, it's just so good. It's definetely my favorite CD ever. It's one of the few CD's I own where I don't have to skip any tracks and probably the only CD I own where I really cannot choose a favorite song, because they all rock! Seriously, I have a new favorite Linkin Park song every week. <br />Their lyrics are very meaningful and I'm sure that everyone can relate to at least one of their songs at some point in their life. I listen to this CD when I'm in a bad mood or a good mood, and of course in the car! And the members of Linkin Park express all these emotions in their songs, without one single curse word! This shows that you don't have to randomly add curse words in your songs to make it feel more emotional.<br />I strongly recommend \\"Hybrid Theory\\" to anyone, no matter what type of music you enjoy. You won't be disappointed in this CD.
B000006OAM|4.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect when I bought this cd.  I wasn't much of a Natalie Merchant fan, but the songs that I did hear were pretty decent. Little did I know that the rest of the songs on her cd were even better.  Its strange how her lyrics are usually uplifting and positive, but the music sounds so dark and mysterious.  A weird combination that I wasn't expecting to like, but I truly do.
B00003Q43A|1.0|Will Smith is quickly establishing himself as the king of commercial (movies).  (Wicky) Wild Wild West and  his heavily sampled music albums are just a couple of examples of his \\"full sale\\" entertainment career.  Independence Day is at the top of the (junk)heap.  All they needed was a schmaltzy Aerosmith title track to make this movie the perfect steaming pile.  This is American movie making at it's worse.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Out of all of Paul's solo albums, Driving Rain comes closest to sounding like a Beatles album. Sure, it does not sound exactly like Beatles music, but you have to think that every new Beatles album sounded fresh, different, and unpredictable, as is the case with Driving Rain. As in most Macca albums, Macca does not stick to one style of music. The difference in this album, however, is that Paul performs each song with new energy and power that can only be heard on Run Devil Run and Beatles records. The songs themselves are not influenced only by the Beatles (ala Flaming Pie), but by many artists such as Pink Floyd and Wings. &quot;She's Giving Up Talking&quot; is a dark song with beautiful guitar work that can be described as a combination of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. &quot;It Must Have Been Magic&quot; is a look back at how Paul and Linda met. Paul's voice never sounded so honest and calm as in this wonderful song. Other songs just plain out rock, &quot;About You&quot; and the 10-minute monster &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot;. My only complaint about the album would be that the lyrics are often quite limited. As long as it sounds good, I can't live with that.
1563896656|5.0|Like most of Moore's work, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is just ridiculously fun.  As has been said, he manages to blend a large number of famous characters from (mostly) 19th century England...including a few none of the reviews here have mentioned.  The plot gets fairly interesting as the story progresses, and it's incredibly fun seeing pieces of several other works of fiction all fall into place in one story.  It's also quite funny, in a mostly sophisticated way.  The art works well here, and as mentioned, has frequent visual gags.  It's worth noting that I don't think knowing who all these characters are is necessary to enjoy this, though the more you know of the stories these people came from, the more fun the whole thing is.<br />In my opinion, this isn't quite at the same level as Moore's Promethia, but it's definitely a &quot;keeper&quot; that I'll be reading again at some point.
B00005QIPH|5.0|'Is this it?' is what music should be about: attitude, spontaneity and incredible songs. It is so easy for people aware of the Stooges, Velvet underground etc., to hark about the influences, but who really cares when the music's this good. It seems that people, due to the hype, have unfortunately formed opinions before truly listening to the music, which isn't to say that everyone will appreciate it as much as me. Bands like the Strokes don't come around often and it's likely that this may be the best album they'll ever make. Remove the hype from most bands, and you're left with mediocrity. Remove the hype from the Strokes, and they're still an incredible entity.
B00003CXTG|3.0|To coincide with the 6oth anniversary of the sneak Japanese attack against American assets, the Disney machine releases the two-disc &quot;PEARL HARBOR&quot; (Touchstone), it's gargantuan recreation of the horrific incident that sealed our involvement in WW II.<br />Set against a sophomoric and predictable love triangle (Ben Afflect, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale), the stunning CGI enhanced invasion and the heartstopping flying sequences are all the more impressive. The Disney team had high hopes of duplicating the success of &quot;Titanic&quot; with what they thought were the same key ingredients but on an even larger scale. But alas, the critics and public did not respond in kind.<br />What made &quot;Titanic&quot; so universally popular had to do with the idea of seeking love in a perfect world that suddenly is doomed. Is there something in our collective subconscious that  understands that? After all, our time here is brief at best. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; does not connect on that delicate, spiritual level but certainly delivers the action. The magnificent looking film on this double disc set is artistically packaged in faux worn leather binder and is further wrapped in self importance with a great History Channel documentary &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; and a fine making of supplement. Disney will further exploit the vulnerable DVD collector when it releases the definitive director's cut next May. That one will have Michael Bay's commentary. Is anyone actually waiting?
B00005JKGK|5.0|A breathtaking film in of itself.  The Joy Luck Club is also a model for film adaptation of books.  What I saw in my mind's eye while reading the book was brought to new levels in the film.  The story is a gripping one for those who enjoy human drama and relationship films.  The film really speaks to the truth that we are all shaped by our parents, especially our mothers.
B00000K19E|5.0|I have loved this movie since I saw it for the 1st time when it 1st came out. Wonderful effects, fresh innovative story, and a handsome star. What more could you want? I am so disappointed that the DVD didn't have some more features. I thought DVDs were so cool because everyone always talked about getting deleted scenes and alternate endings, and this had none of that. I love deleted scenes, bloopers and alternate endings. That's kinda why I had hopped on the DVD bandwagon. Guess I should have done better research cause I haven't seen one deleted scene yet! Oh well, still a very awesome flick.
B00003CXXS|1.0|While The Special Effects Are incredible, The movie lacks one major thing, A STORY. This has to be the pinnacle of lazy filmmaking. Sure, The dinosaurs look better here than before, but where is the plot? Where is the suspends? Where are the likeable characters?  Special Effects are fine if this was made with a camp sense of humor (Like The Mummy Returns or any of the Tremors movies) but this is not even funny in a camp sort of way.  It's just down right bad. Even Sam Neill is bad in this film, and that is embarrassing because he is great in anything.  I know Some people are saying that if you don't compare it to the First Two films, then you will enjoy it, but that is a bunch of [nonsense]. The first two movie( Jurassic Park And The Lost World) were great because they were about something. They had compelling stories to them, And characters you can care about. They also were great popcorn films that were fun and exciting to watch. This one is just a mess with no sense of purpose at all. This is just a bad film with the name Jurassic Park attached to it.
6302860253|4.0|Unfortunately, it's not the best operatic version. This version as a recorded opera lacks the sensuality and tragedy of Bizet's original vision. It's due mostly to the miscasting of Julia Migenes as Carmen. Her voice is not suited for the role. She is out of place with the great talents of Domingo, Esham and Raimondi. Lorin Maazel's orchestration has its moments but lacks charm in certain parts. The film is excellent with Rosi conducting, everything from the opening scenes of the bullfight ending to the strains of the Overture to the climatic finale when Don Jose confronts a red-clad Carmen. The cinematic treatment is superb, shot entirely on location in Spain, combining a rustic and exotic charm to the film, particularily the streets of Seville and the bullfight arena. The Gypsy song, to which Carmen and her friends dance at Lilla's Pastias tavern, is done far too slow, the Habanera is overdone and made to look more like a dance number than the fine operatic piece it really is, and Migenes is not Bizet's attractive heroine. Yes. See the film because it is undoubtedly great. But do not get the soundtrack. If you wish a truly excellent Carmen, listen to either the version with Victoria De Los Angeles as Carmen, or Grace Bumbry (who is the best Carmen) in the 1971 recording with John Vickers as Don Jose and Mirella Freni as Micaela. All in all, this film is excellent. But I give it only 4 stars and the complete 5 due to the disappointing Migenes as Carmen and Maazel's weakness in orchestration.
B00005UKE0|5.0|George Harrison astounded me with this album when I first heard it as a teen.  No more Beatles?  NOPE, not with this three record box set.  This set was picked apart and every word was scrutinized by my friends and I.  We inhaled the smell of the box.<br />This is a recording that really surpasses the white album because it's only George.  One man made an album from his heart and no monkey business.  No other BEATLE produced anything on his own to equal this set.<br />You can tell that George had an awful lot of stuff piled up in his heart and soul.  The release of &quot;LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD&quot;  was the definitive cap on the bottle of Harrison's verve and immolation.  I love his strength to do his own thing.  He really pulled through for me.
B0000042H4|5.0|Arguably the best recording. Many would still say that Karajan's is the finest or Karl Bohm's live recording at the Bayreuth. Solti delivers an incredible rendition, orchestrating every key moment effectively; the preludes, the Magic Fire music, the Funeral March and the climatic finale. Wagner himself would approve of the cast. Birgint Nilsson will forever be Brunhilde, strong, beautiful, defiant and governed by the fate of her emotions. Neidlinger's Alberich is excellent, encompassing all his lust and greed, and the villanious Hagen is performed to perfection. The Nordic myth of the Ring, with its epic scope and symbolic meanings, has been called prophetic(scholars believe it is a moralistic insight to the twentieth century and modernism), has been called psychological (Freudian interpretations claim the Ring can be seen as man's mental-derived lust for power, or it can simply be one of the most exciting tragedies ever composed. We are drawn to the realm of fantasy and the tragic turn of events that begin with Alberich steals the Ring from the Rhinemaidens  and finalize with the immolation of Siegfried and Brunhilde. The theme is very simple: absolute power, as exemplified by the ring, corrupts absolutely. In the end, even the gods in Valhalla, who have craved the ring's power, are subject to a most dire fate. This is Wagner's masterpiece, years in the making, meant for the world to behold and appreciate, priced affordably and orchestrated unsurpassed by the great Solti. Five Stars all the way.
B00001NFCY|2.0|Take me higher - what an awesome number!  But the rest of this CD degenerates into a third-rate Pearl jam thing that I was ashamed to listen to.   The passion is just not there with these guys...and MTV sweat does not count!  <br />I must admit I was excited at the fact that ALT music was not dying with so many bands 'popping' on to the scene after Pearl Jam had a 'break' and Soundgarden just called it a day - but CREED is not the answer to the alt or any fan's rock today (unless you like bury your head!).  This CD is pretty cool, however there is a LOT of great music out there that is just as good that does not have the corporate endorsement that CREED has...(or maybe HAD).
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's style is very unique, passionate, and gets you moving.  Please stop referring to her as an Alanis clone - she has been around a LOT longer than Alanis Morisette.  She's an original.
B00005MP58|2.0|While I agree that this miniseries is awesome, this Special Edition DVD set pales (literally) in comparison with most other releases. My wife and I had worn out the tapes we made when the series first aired on A&E, and have since burned through the subsequent VHS official release, and most recently have been enjoying it on the first DVD release.<br />(...)the color/tint/brightness are all washed out. There is too much contrast in the color, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The hue of the color is also waashed out, a little too bleak to enjoy Ms. Bennett's rosy cheeks or Mr. D'Arcy's walk from the pond...<br />The widescreen aspect is great; it does add a bit of grandeur to the scenes, but the freaky color has us put off. Maybe if you've never seen this before, this edition would seem ok, but we feel a bit let down by the results.
0140186409|5.0|I've never known poverty.  Every day I have had food, every night I have had shelter and all of my needs have always been fulfilled.  After 28 years on God's Earth, my understanding of poverty has now become clearer.  Grapes of Wrath is timeless.  When a 60 year-old novel can move a grown man to tears that is powerful.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will simply say it is the most touching ending that I have ever read in a book, seen in a movie or heard in a song.  I had to read the last page three times to really get the full effect.  I have young children, this will be one of the first novels I will want them to read as teens.  I think I would have been more compassionate and understanding in my teens and twenties if I had read this earlier.  For years I have listed To Kill a Mockingbird as my favorite book.  Hats off to Steinbeck, I've changed my mind and Grapes of Wrath is Simply the Best!
B00005R23S|5.0|After seeing this show live, all I needed to preserve my memories, was this amazing double DVD set.<BR>Bruce and the E street band, once again prove to the world they rock better than ever, better than anyone else.<BR>Amazing performance for &quot;Light of a day&quot;, amazing &quot;Backstreets&quot;, incredible &quot;Darkness on the edge of town&quot;.<BR>A most have concert for all music lovers!
B00005B36H|5.0|There are certain groups out there who will release a highly successful album, become unable to duplicate the popularity of that album, and then fade into the sunset, never to be heard from again (at least not until their &quot;Best Of&quot; album is released several years later).  I submit as evidence &quot;The Gin Blossoms.&quot;  Tool, thankfully, is not one of these bands.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; is a superb effort which continues Tool's trend of ever-inproving albums.  Maynard &amp; the boys provide their listeners with a smorgasbord of styles, and Lateralus sends out a vibe that is quite unique.  There is a certain feeling throughout each track which cannot be explained without having heard each one for yourself.  I hesitate in using the term &quot;progressive&quot; to describe it, but I can think of no other musical genre that can hold your attention for 11 minutes.  Although Lateralus is somewhat of a departure from &quot;Undertow&quot; and &quot;Aenima&quot;, it still holds true to the ear-splitting power-chord, frequent tempo shift &amp; gut-wrenching lyric formula which Tool fans have come to know and love.  I would reccommend this album to both Tool fans and anyone else who can appreciate a truly great rock album.
B00005B36H|5.0|If you have been following Tool since the beginning then I think you will find that this CD is not as heavy and angry but it has a lot of the melodic styling of Maynard's voice blended with the expert guitar work we've grown to love. Tool is stretching out in this album maturing into what they are best at. This might not be the album that you drive to but it's the music that you'll be missing when you're not listening to it... and it's definitely Tool which is worth the money right there
B00000420F|5.0|If you owned only one of Cecilia Bartoli's albums, before her wondrous Vivaldi and Gluck releases, IF YOU LOVE ME, would be it.<BR>Not only is her voice extraordinarily flexible in a technical sense, but her capacity to convey the emotions found in the lyrics is unmatched today, at least to my ears.<br />The most beautiful songs on this recording are:<BR>Son Tutto Duolo, Caro Mio Ben, Selve Amiche, and Sposa Son Disprezzata. The entire album is great and Gyorgi Fischer is a wonderful match on the piano to Ms. Bartoli's talents. There's so much melancholy in these songs, but how welcome it is when Cecilia's sings of it!!<br />Bravissima!!!
6304331851|5.0|I highly recommend this movie musical of &quot;Camelot.&quot;  It is a very beautiful story, with wonderful songs and costumes.  I'd give it more stars if I could.  It's a beautiful love story.
0440133688|5.0|The best book of it's kind to be written! Not only is it funny, but it is TOTALLY TRUE. Shem's portrayal of a year in the life of an intern is right on and especially timely now, in the days of managed care. Much too often decisions are made for other reasons than the patients' welfare. The trick,per Shem, is to work within the system without getting yourself booted out of it. The second trick is to take care of yourself while taking care of the patient. This is mandatory reading for both patients and health care providers. Take heart, though, the good Docs are out there, you just may have some trouble finding one.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I have spent 11 years of my life studying music.  From my opinion, I can tell you that this is the best soundtrack I have seen in years.  I truly find it brilliant.  First of all, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor use their &quot;own&quot; voices, no standins.  That alone is impressive.  But who would have thought that they would sing so fantastically?  I was amazed, stunned, and still can not get over it.  I listen to the CD every single day.  I am just panting for the DVD to come out.  If you have not heard this CD, then you have missed out this year!!!  You must get this!  It is truly magnificent.
0679720200|5.0|No one was more responsible for the nurturing and development of the existentialist philosophies than Jean Paul Sartre.  That said, Sartre's words simply lacked the power and more importantly the compassion and understanding of Albert Camus.  Camus starts his text, The Stranger, with the literary equivalence of a powerful punch.  He ends it with two punches.  Despite my disagreement over key elements in his philosophies, I am nonetheless more than impressed with his concise voice and storytelling.  The Stranger is not only a must read, but a mantra to many bearing the angst of irrelevance.  I highly recommend \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" for further insight into this wonderful text.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is the classic of the seven Chronicles of Narnia books. In it we meet Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, four siblings who find a way to Narnia.<br />This is a story that kids and adults will love. I read it aloud to my 4-year old son. He was able to follow it when we read one chapter per day. Older kids will get more out of it.<br />The story brings up interesting discussion. One of which is how do we know what is true? How do we know who to believe? What is redemption? Can people change? What is real love?<br />Young kids may not think about these questions. But the answers, in the form of the characters, is set in their minds after reading this book. I plan to read this book and the whole Narnia series to my children as they grow older.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This romance-comedy story is by far the most romantic and classic fairy tale I have ever seen.  It is delightful and delicate as a flower. Beautiful scenes.  When are they going to release it in color and dvd?  Audrey and Gregory have the magical chemistry that makes this movie everyone's favorite.<BR>A must to see and treasure by young and old audience.
B000002TRM|5.0|I looked for this CD forever, some of the best recordings of the peppers songs. Essential if you're a big fan (which I am) I finally found it at a CD warehouse, still my greatest moment. I listen to it constantly. Not a good CD for beginners, but for the die-hard fan, a must have!!
B00003CXRM|3.0|This film is a &quot;Coenized&quot; version of Homer's Odyssey which takes place in the American south.  It is a movie about a man's journey back home and along the way Ulysees (Everett) played by George Clooney encounters sirens and a cyclops.<br />The structure of the film isn't as cogent as their previous films however it is very well crafted in terms of cinamatography and especially the music. <br />A slightly above average film and not as good as you might expect it to be -- unless Hillbilly music is your thing.
6305546789|1.0|good movie but not that goodddddddddd. jamie lee curtis is good in this movieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.i guess see it  not scary.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I love Pink's &quot;Let's get this party Started&quot; track.  Her CD has a broad collection of songs from blues to dance music.  She is an up and coming singer that is sure to go far. I also love her videos and her sense of humor that she projects.  Rock on Pink!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is a Classic. There is really no other way to describe it. I decided to read this book for a Grade 9 Book Report and I loved it! The author gives great character personality and keeps them realistic. The plot is amazing: there is always something happening. Some people MIGHT find this book slightly boring at some parts, but overall, it's a really good story! To Kill A Mockingbird does bring up Racial Discrimination in the 19th and 20th Century, but shows this realistically. This is undoubtedly my absolute favourite book! I highly recommend it to anyone in for a Good Read! :)
B00005QK3W|4.0|After reading some of the reviews for this CD (positive and negative), I have to say I agree that Paul's latest effort takes time to get into.  Even on the first listening, when I experienced some initial disappointment, I found several songs that I could really get into.  &quot;Heather&quot; just struck me as beautiful, &quot;Lonely Road&quot; kicks off the compilation well, and I believe that &quot;Freedom&quot; was great to get as a bonus.  Then, as I listened more and more, I really started to like &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; with its Yappa Yap Yap and sort of mysterious sound.  Then &quot;Driving Rain&quot; had me singing &quot;1 2 3 4 5...&quot; right along with Paul.  I now am really into all the songs on the CD except &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; -- just a little too long for my tastes, although I may come to like it eventually.  There are some nice parts to it.  <br />If you are a McCartney fan, you won't want to skip this one.  It is a very mature offering with just the right amount of freshness and edginess.  Amazing what this man can still do at 59!
0345347951|5.0|After reading Childhood's End, it still awes me.  <br />The book follows three stories.  Th first, Earth and the Overlords, is about the strange, large ships that appearover the reat cities of earth, and the Overlord, Karellen.  Karellen talks with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Rikki Stormgren.  No one else of that generation has ever, or will ever see an Overlord, but Stormgren plans to be the first.<br />In the Golden Years, Rupert and Maia get married and have a big party decades later.  The Overlords have shown themselves to humanity, and their secrecy on appearance is apparent.  Yet a mystery still remains.  Jam, Maia's brother, questions what planet are they from? The answer he gets will surprise him.<br />In the third story, Jan plans to stowaay n an Overlord ship and travel to their planet. It will take 40 Earth years to get there, but he will only age a few weeks.  What he sees there stuns and awes him.  He returns to Earth 80 years after he left, only to discover Childhood's End.<br />I hope I didn't give away too much about this bok.  It was really a great book, provoking many thoughts about how we believe and how great man's accomplishments truly are.<br />At first it was tough getting into this book because the reader has no clue what is truly going on.  All they know is that there are alien ships above the world's greatest cities, and because of that there is a great change that takes place.  After getting into this book, the reader becomes enthralled in the destiny of Earth and her children.

B00005RFAI|5.0|Okay, I heard Pink's &quot;Let's Get This Party Started&quot; once and absolutely had to go out and buy the CD.  Pink has a great voice and is a refreshingly real and not overly produced (Britney) talent. Her music tracks make you want to go out and dance. I'm thrilled for her success and look forward to buying more of her stuff.  Her new CD offers a broad mix of music from dance to R&amp;B to pop. She rocks and I'm a fan.  Buy this CD.  You will be pleased that you did.

B000001G7O|5.0|\\"This is not (only) a violin concerto, not (only) a virtuoso performance: This is a story, a love story told by Mutter's voice and Karajan conducting... Composers express themselves through their music: Mutter captured Tchaikovsky's love story. Tolstoy's images are coming in front of your eyes listening to this recording...\\"<br /><br />I wish to add as this week-end I revisited this recording in light of hearing Anne-Sophie Mutter live, here in Vancouver. For those reading the newspaper hoping to catch an account of the concert, you'll have to wait, perhaps another 19 years...<br /><br />There is no doubt that Mutter's rendition of the concerto is highly personal, highly passionate and very different let's say from Repin's vision. However, it is this personal vision, supremely articulated and expressed that transcends the piece of music and touched me. Yes Karajan is heavy but somehow his style fits the discourse Mutter wants to tell us: how many passionate women have fallen for rather unrefined men? Only to fall out and play with them later...<br /><br />All this is of course to be taken to the second degree: only a local CBC presenter would want to bring it down below the waist.<br /><br />By the way, Mutter played the Beethoven concerto, accompanied by a rather uninspired group starting with the conductor, who we were warned, battled the flu to gratify us of his presence. Mutter in fact was conducting, encouraging the concertmaster, turning toward the viola section while the conductor was busy with his papers...<br /><br />3,000 people were mesmerized and knew they witnessed the real deal. Her command of the instrument always serves her storytelling and yes, sure, one might want to have the story told differently. I for one would have enjoyed to hear the Schnittke Cadenza. But Mutter's story is refined, eloquent, intelligent and of an accute sensibility and sensitivity.<br /><br />In the past I have not been convinced by some recordings such as the Sibelius. At 44, she is clearly on top of her art and a unique voice, worth hearing in this world. It is fashionable these days to criticize her in the British press. Norman Lebrecht is leading the charge and upon last night hearing, is in my opinion, crudely mistaken.voice, worth hearing in this world.

B00000C28M|5.0|After seeming some of the more tepid reviews of this CD, I felt obliged to come to its defense. The historical value of this CD alone merits 5 stars. Bernstein's speech in the beginning is very interesting (although I'm not a Bernstein fan) and the portion of an interview at the end with Glenn Gould (and I'm a big Gould fan)is also very interesting. In between was what I thought was a great performance of Brahms by two outstanding musicians. The sound quality is understandably not up to 21st century levels, but it pretty good by mid-20th century technological standards. According to the excellent linear notes that comes with this CD, Bernstein may have been strongly influenced by Gould's interpretation of Brahms. It seems Glenn had the last laugh!
B00005LOUQ|2.0|The visuals were wonderful but the whole film lacked any spirit.  It was a very paint by numbers movie.  Lacks any joy or heart.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I have every Diana Krall CD and eagerly anticipated this release. Unfortunately, Ms. Krall didn't seem as enthusiastic to get back in the recording studio as this is a very lackluster effort which she seems to sleepwalk through. Nothing new,nothing different,nothing memorable on this CD. I'm on to Jane Monheit...
B00003CXTG|3.0|The action was awesome! It was some of the best action I've ever seen. The romance ruined the movie. It was a shame that they put it in there. When I get the DVD I am going to just skip all the chapters with the love scenes.
B00005RFAI|5.0|You've had those CDs where you jam to one song, then skip, then skip, then \\"oh yah, #6 is a good song\\" - jam to that - then skip, then skip, \\"oh and 11 too - that's good\\".  You realize you paid ...for 3 songs!  Then you feel like a sucker.  THIS CD IS NOT ONE OF THOSE!  Every song in Missundaztood is delictable and unique and is infused with influences from all types of musical genres.  Lyrics are raw but not over poetic and smarmy.  If you could wearout a CD from playing it over and over again, you'd wearout this one and buy another one and feel great about it!
6304712936|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best movies ever made, and also one of my personal favorites.  My parents gave me an extensive cultural education beginning in Utero--to give you an example, I could recognize Eine Kneine Nacht Music by sound by the time I was four.  &quot;Amadeus&quot; came out around the time of my birth, and it would be impossible to tally up how many times I saw it in my early childhood.  I became interested in it once again around my thirteenth birthday, and soon became captivated by it once again.
B00005LMBK|4.0|i like this album, but not all of it. there are definitely great tracks in it and i highly reccomend it to all fans of hip hop - alternative crossover, because this cd melds the two genres well. Clint Eastwood and Starshine are clearly the two most pop-centric tracks, dan the automator does his thing well, but just as in the handsome boy modeling agency, sometime he leaves his pop sensibilities and tries to make the music \\"deep\\" which is when it begins to (...). so, as long as you don't mind not liking a few tracks on a cd you own, this is a great cd to have, otherwise, just buy the singles because the remixes are dope.
B00005NTNU|4.0|I've been waiting for the Dirty Harry Series on DVD for awhile now and was no disappointed.  All the movies have excellent transfers picture and sounds wish there where a few extras but I'm not complaining.  Why only 4 stars because the Dead Pool was included in the set zzzzzzzzz
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink sings beautifully and full of passion. She can sing a phone book and make it sound moving and interesting and unique. That's how great and creative she is!!! The best song on here, IMO, is &quot;Lonely Girl&quot; this is worth the price of admission alone. It really moves you, and Linda Perry provides a wonderful acoustic guitar and backing vocals.<br />Awesome album!!!!!!!!! Go Pink!!!!!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|&quot;Rainbow Children,&quot; this CD is superb!!<br />Prince, has done a masterful job of intertwining bits of history, both exoteric and otherwise, into a musical gem that will last for many decades to come.

B00003CXTG|3.0|Granted Pearl Harbor was an over blown production of epic proportions that used virtually all known devices of modern Hollywood filmmaking to glamorize the events of December 7th. It still managed to remind the movie going public that there are moments in time that should never be forgotten, but rather perpetuated eternally through the use of cinema. <br />(...)<br />You can call Michael Bay a hack all you want, but I seriously don't think he will care. I would like to remind everyone of the fact that not everyone (even most directors) can handle a 145 million dollar budget, get the green light from a major studio (Disney) team with one of the biggest producers of all time (Bruckheimer again, who also chose Michael to direct Bad Boys, The Rock, and Armageddon) work tirelessly for 2 years doing research about the actual people who survived the attack, deal with the casting, the location, the shooting, the post production and the marketing. So for that much I respect Michael Bay. And it was not entirely his fault Randal Wallace wrote such a trite and cliché script, some things just turn out that way. Was it unforgivable in the sense that this was supposed to have been the biggest movie of the year? Maybe, but personally, in this year of such personal tragedy and hate in the world, I would rather push it all aside and just watch the film for it's historical significance, and salute those who died in the actual attack, more than 60 years ago.<br />(...)
B000000W5L|5.0|\\"Exile on Main Street\\" is the double album that haunts the Stones even today. Drug problems in the band (and in the production booth) were raging, but the creativity was not yet dulled - that would come later. Borne of chaos in the basement of Keith Richards' house in the south of France and suffering from the resulting leakage between instrumental tracks, the sessions were chaotic and seemingly unending. In fact, the final dubbing and mixing were so problematic that Jagger -Richards &amp; Co. were totally unaware of the masterpiece they had created-instead, they were much too busy replacing many out-of-tune bass parts and struggling to fit final vocals into the ultra-complex instrumental mixes.<br />The songs themselves run the gamut of American music-everything from traditional Black American blues to Country to Roots Rock-it's all here in one glorious panorama. Initially the album was misunderstood - there were no rebel anthems like on the previous three (now-classic) albums, and the up-tempo rockers were so tastefully understated that it was easy to overlook the greatness of the album as a whole-at first. No one track is a real attention grabber the way \\"Moonlight Mile\\" or \\"Dead Flowers\\" are on the previous year's Sticky Fingers, the former song for its dreamy instrumental beauty, the latter for its sassy satirical bite. But with Exile, every track's excellence seeps into one's consciousness with repeated listenings-the texture is so rich, the tone so intimate, unlike any Stones album before or since. And the songs themselves hold up so well with time, without ever revealing to the listener just what it is about them that makes them so good and timeless.<br />Indeed, the Stones themselves still seem perplexed by their masterpiece. Interviewers mention it to them as their artistic apex, and Jagger - Richard begin invariably to mutter darkly instead about the record's difficult birth and the chilly initial reception. &quot;Exile&quot; turned their world upside down, with its wider appeal to more sophisticated audiences and bigger, more sweeping ambitions. Their subsequent releases mirrored this dilemma - &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot; (1973) was a confused mess that aspired to please that wider audience, &quot;It's Only Rock and Roll&quot; (1974) a self-conscious attempt to renounce that and get back to `fun' music. Neither succeeded on its own terms, because the goalposts had been moved so much farther away - by that wonderful double album that everyone badmouthed at first.<br />Just as &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is Miles Davis's masterpiece, &quot;Exile&quot; is The Stones' definitive release, despite the stiff competition offered by all their 1960s classics and their 1971 classic, &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;.
B0000024JN|4.0|the beastie boys are my favorite band and as i get older i find my taste in their records progessing. licensed to ill was the first beasties album i got into, and although it is my least favorite now, it brings back memories. overall it is not a bad record, i would rather listen to this than not listening to any beastie boys, but there are so many better records like: check your head, ill communication, pauls boutique, etc. what is great about the beastie boys they have so many different sides to them that they have record for whatever mood youre in. this is good place to start, but not the place to end. the beasties talent is apparent by their ability to play such a variety of music. too many people think of this record when they think of the beastie boys. dont let that happen to you. the beastie boys are an amazing group, and one of the most talented.<BR>namaste
B00003CX5P|5.0|Now, I'm a HUGE star wars fan. I am also a purist. So I was furious when the storyline didn't quite work with the original trilogy. I'll get off that path now, though because this could turn into an essay.<br />If you enjoy a good martial arts fight, see this. Forget the rest of it. I enjoy this movie for the special effects, Ewan McGregor, the INCREDIBLE! fight-sequenes and the beautiful costumes. The movie does not hold with the original trilogy as much as I'd like, but since Episode II is going to AWESOME, you'd better see this first.<br />The special features on this DVD are to die for. Go immediately to the fight and costume short features. They created an entirely new form of martial arts for this movie. If you're a martial arts fan or want to know more about the Jedi, this feature is amazing. The theory behind the fighting is really intricate. Costumes are just beautiful. Need someone to make me costumes like that. =)<br />In short, get this movie for the DVD features and the connection it has to the SW universe
0440219078|5.0|i just recently finished reading this book in my 7th grade language arts class and i LOVED it! i never like the books that we read in class but i really enjoyed this book. there are so many things to think about and to love about this book. if u like books that explain things and have a wrap-up ending then u wouldnt like this book at all, but if u like thinking about things then u will LOVE this book. this is a great read for everyone. im gonna suggest it for everyone to read.BUY THIS GREAT BOOK.
0385493800|4.0|The Testament is a bit different from the rest of John Grisham's books.  The normal courtroom drama is present, but along with it comes a exhilirating race to find a young woman deep within the rainforest.  This woman is Rachel Lane, the long-lost daughter of millionaire Troy Phelan.  After Troy commits suicide by taking a leap out of a window, his lawyers examine his will, in which he leaves the vast majority of his fortune to Rachel.  Enter Nate O'Riley, a down and out lawyer on the run from the IRS.  Nate is sent to Brazil to locate Rachel to inform her of her inheritance.  When he finally reaches her, she touches his life like nobody else has before.  Meanwhile, back in the United States, the rest of Troy's children are throwing a fit over their father's actions.  With The Testament, Grisham has written yet another winner that will surely rocket to the top of the charts.  Worth every penny!
B00005NEZ3|2.0|I cant believe all these people gave this CD a good rating. I bought it thinking that all of the songs were going to be like &quot; Clint Eastwood&quot;, you know with a little rap, but some singing. Well let me tell you that this was soon to be found out not to be the case. A lot of the songs are weak, and its more sound FX than song, and the singer just wails in a lot of the tracks. The only relatively good song on this album are, &quot;5/4&quot;, &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, &quot;Double bass&quot;(Although its all instrumentals, and keeps repeating itself), &quot;Rock the house&quot;, and &quot;19-2000&quot;. So if you asked me if you should buy this CD I would say NO.
B000005IRG|5.0|&quot;Marquee Moon&quot; is, well, amazing.  Like many other great albums it takes a little getting used to, but that's because it's unlike anything you've ever heard before.  There are some blues-based rockers here (&quot;See No Evil,&quot; &quot;Friction&quot;), but I think the real killers are the ones where the band ventures into stranger waters.  On &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Elevation,&quot; the guitars don't wail or cry, they bleep like computers and chime like bells.  This is the sound that almost all great indie-rock is built on.  The guitar-playing is mind-bogglingly good and, what is even more mind-boggling, it doesn't sound silly or self-indulgent.  Tom Verlaine is a great songwriter (my vote for &quot;Best Underground Pop Song of All Time&quot; goes to &quot;Venus&quot;), and the band is good enough that on the title track they can turn a 5-minute guitar solo (just the words &quot;5-minute guitar solo&quot; are usually enough to make me cringe) into possibly the most effective build-up in rock history, the orchestra-and-alarm-clock build-up in &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; not excepted.  Tom Verlaine's vocal style may be off-putting to those who don't listen to punk or indie music, but it can be really really effective, &quot;Venus&quot; being the prime example.  So, in conclusion, if you don't have this album, I would suggest that you buy it.  If you don't like it at first, listen to it again and again and again until you do.  Some day you'll thank me.
B000002UA5|4.0|I personally cannot bear the dirge LPs that followed the ecstatic &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; Okay, parts of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; were brilliant. The Floyd I love were seen by most through the Window Pane.  Even the cover of this darn thing should have served the uninitiated fair enough warning to Don't Look Now.  Popular in dorms of its day as the &quot;acid test&quot; LP (not that I'm endorsing such behavior!), &quot;Ummagumma&quot; turned lots of folks onto experimental and avant garde musics like Varese and Cage, and opened many minds and ears. Moreover, cuts like the Stygian/Celestial &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; set some folks on journeys from which they would never return. In some ways, yes, it's dated; in others, it shows newbies how downright awful commercial music has become.  Mind you, they used to play THIS on the radio.  Tell that to your bean counters.
0800177177|4.0|While many vampire movies contain your basic good guys and bad guys, in this movie it isn't really that simple to tell them apart. In my opinion, Draula is the hero and he appears to be all to human, with human desires, fears, wants and needs. Don't put off buying this movie as it is a true love story in every sense of the word. But be warned, it is rather gory in certain scenes so children ought not to watch this. Try it, I think that you will be pleasently surprised. Enjoy!!!
B00004SCX6|2.0|Curses to Spears for destroying the rock n' roll classic of classics, &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction.&quot;  The terrible remix of this wonderful Stones work just goes to show Britney's lack of respect for music.  Still, if you're 14, a girl, and like to dance around the room because you're too young to drive, this one is for you.  A personal note:  I think it would be funny to give Spears a guitar, a piece of paper, and a pen and ask her to write a song.  I bet the response would be, &quot;Well, I'll write the song, but first I need a keyboard, a drum machine, and a songwriter.&quot;
B00004Z400|5.0|First a jangling guitar, followed by screaming, followed by metal, preceding the best CD ive heard in ages. The pure passion of Back to School, the eerie quietness of Digital Bath, the sick, nigh frightening Elite, the quietly heartfelt High School of Teenager, and the almost epic feel of Change, this album goes through so many emotions, yet maintains a sort of continuity. Maybe its because despite the changes, this album puts you in generally the same state of mind. Chino's weary, yet passionate vocals, backed by epic, disjointed music, creating a cold, mechanical feel, keeping you somewhat close to the ground, while inside you just want to scream your lungs out and bang your head.<BR>The whole mix of things will play mind games with you, and youll love every minute of it.
B00005R2M3|5.0|this cd is my favorite cd! it is so awesome- Shakira has an amazing talent and a breathtaking voice.  This cd is perfect for anyone who likes great music! its got fast and slow songs and they're all wonderful! WAY TO GO SHAKIRA!
6304806442|4.0|That is one thing this Movie is lacking in is Action, but that is actually it's strength as cliched action scencs will totally destroy this movie.  This movie is intelligent, funny, and quite thought provoking.  But what about it? <br />Drugs seems to be the main focus here to many people but it is not.  &quot;Life&quot; is the main focus in this movie.  Drug addiction is just one way of looking at it, and this prespective is done really well.  Though I never did heroin in my life, I heard that it was an excrutiaing experience during withdrawl... but this is true for most drugs that have a similar mode of action as heroin.  <br />What about life though? What's the point of this movie? The point is life, and life is just something you make of it, and is your choice wether you decide to pick it up, or dump it down the toilet.  But life it self can be a joke in some respect, and also quite depressing to choose a life to become another &quot;Average Joe&quot;, blending into everything... barely noticable.
B00000K2SC|5.0|I dont want to make this long.<BR>I loved this movie. The whole thing lacks color and the characters never change thier tone of voice. But the special effects are outstanding. I liked the plot too because no one ever has come up with something like that. There's a million types of horror movies. But this movie is one of a kind. The fight seens are exellent.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is my first Incubus CD, and I like it. I love the way the voices change so much in one song. It is a great CD and it is always in my changer. I listen to it every day.
0767836324|4.0|First of all not everyone is going to like the same movie.<br />Second I think that this movie showed a great portrayal of how  fun life was when you were a kid. You get the biggest urge of wanting to be a part of Neverland. The leading roles Hook, Peter Pan, and tinkerbell were handled beautifully. I liked how the movie combined the elements of adventrure, fantasy, and love all into one. The music scores were set at perfect places, and fit in very well. However I noticed a few flaws; the setting of neverland looks more like a movie set, Hook was well played, but his lines could have been written better, and that took most away from his threating image, the lost boys seemed too lost to understand how to act like there from neverland and not a junior high school. Other than that this movie was hopeful, and heartwarming
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I just had to see this movie. A critic I greatly respect-Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine, named it his number 1 choice of Indie films of 2001. I can definitely see why now. This is a very good movie and will doubtless go down as one of the best in the film noir genre because of it's unique way of laying out the plot-in reverse order! I was spellbound throughout watching the main character-Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) search for his wife's rapist and murderer even though he can't remember events after 5 or 10 minutes pass. The acting and screenplay were topnotch, and Guy Pearce gets my vote as the Best Actor of 2001. Christopher Nolan took a chance making this movie without backing of a major studio and that took guts. The result is well worth the effort. I rate it a resounding 5.
B00000I8BX|5.0|This is probably Fear Factory's Best CD. To tell the truth i didnt really like digimortal that much (even though it was still good)Dino's amazingly fast guitars, Burton's deep and awesome voice, Christian's low and heavy bass, and Raymonds drumming sounds like a machine gun goin off in an open field make the album one the best metal albums to date. The album goes from a thrashy cool beggining (Shock, EdgeCrusher), to the very good, emotional \\"Descent\\", and then back to kik-*ss metal (Freedom of Fire,Soulwound,Messiah) My favorite song on this is 0-0(Where Evil Dwells) This song is VERY thrashy, loud, and makes you want to beat the (...) out of everyone and everthing in site! Buy this version of this cd because the bonus trax are very good.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|It's about time the Maiden kings got back! This is a great album ever since the downfall in the 90s. Bruce takes the vocals down a little bit, but still is very good. Very intelligent lyrics also to these epics. There are a few problems. (...) It's too long. Also, there are some boring parts in diffrent songs. But it's ok. Janick Gers adds more to the band. (...) I think he's a great guitarist, and fits perfectly with the band. Also, there are some of the band's best hits. Wicker Man, Nomad, and Dream Of Mirrors to name a few. Good album.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I skipped this movie in the theater, and I'm glad.  I was afraid to watch Ben Affleck after Armageddon, the movie which started his career towards running parallel with Leonardo DiCaprio's.  Ben Affleck was worth watching in his Mallrats and Chasing Amy flicks, but now I wouldn't waste my money on his movies again. I made that mistake twice (Armageddon and Pearl Harbor), I'm not going to make it a third time.<br />The name \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is accurate for less than half of the movie.  I would have named it \\"Titanic in Hawaii\\" or something like that.  This movie reminds me what I think NSync would be in movie form.  ($) is not worth the 10 minutes of interesting footage surrounded by (...).  The first time I watched it I had to fast forward to find out if the movie had ANYTHING to do with Pearl Harbor. I like war movies, especially naval ones, but this I'd classify as worthless and embarassing to own.
B000007RYQ|5.0|I so desperately wanted to hate this recording.  Upon looking at the line-up (which includes a DJ and a guitarist!), I wanted to listen to this recording and write a virulent, bile-filled review of it.<br />However, it's brilliant.<br />Uri Caine, manages to distill Mahler's music down to its very core.  Sounds strange and daunting, and this is definitely quite a task, but Caine succeeds.  The pain, the longing of Mahler's symphonies comes out here, as does his Semitic influences (which are often covered-up in his orchestrations).<br />It's odd, but by playing Mahler's music with unusual arrangements and lineups, Caine is showing us a &quot;pure&quot; Mahler...he's removing the introduction, the body, and the conclusion, and giving us the thesis statement...and some really awesome improvised solos.<br />This is a triumph for the avant-garde, and for Mahler.  He would have approved.
0425170349|5.0|After reading this book i am a commited clancy fan. Rainbow six was the first of clancy's books I read and I now know that it is a large step away from his other books and in particular, his series. The book still clings closely to the Tried and True Clancy Formula, with character profiles taking up a good third of the book. However, once I finished reading the full 900 pages.... which i agree, to some may seem extravagent and unforfilling, to me it represented a brilliantly crafted diplay of writing and storytelling excellence and it has succeeded in making me a fan of the legendary writer, Tom Clancy.
B00005214X|5.0|Well, of course, let's start off with the obvious - George Harrison passed away November 29, 2001.<br />I'd never seen a reason to write a review for this album before - I'd made the trek to my local record shop for five weeks in the cold winter of 2001, hoping for this album to come in. And, lo and behold, it did, after what seemed like years of waiting.<br />This.<BR>Album.<BR>Rocks.<br />There's not very much else to say. I write the review now because, after George's death, so many people are suddeny sitting up and paying attention. His first post-Beatles album, the material on here is mostly Beatles-caliber (as it's mostly stuff that the other two music-writers of the Beatles wouldn't let on the last few albums). Harrison, a devout follower of what he calls the Krishna Consciousness religion, throws religious mention throughout the music. Unlike his later albums, however, Harrison seems to find a balance between preaching and singing, keeping a somewhat etherial but not condescending tone up nicely. &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, the #1 single that would later get him into trouble, is a lovely piece, as are &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, &quot;What Is Life&quot;, &quot;Let It Down&quot;, &quot;Let It Roll&quot;, &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Awaiting On You All&quot;, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot;, &quot;The Art Of Dying&quot;, and &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot;. The &quot;Apple Jams&quot; at the end are good listens, but pretty forgettable. Harrison also, in honor of the re-release, recorded a new, 'unplagarized' version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, which just doesn't have the same ring of the original. The instrumental &quot;What Is Life&quot; is my favorite piece on the album. Absolutely beautiful, I can see why he cut the excess instruments (they would get in the way of Harrison's vocals) but alone they sound marvelous. This is the track I listened to, over and over, when George passed away.<br />All those songs listed above glue the rest of the somewhat mediocre but never outright awful album together, and more than ever give it 5 stars. This is the Best of Harrison's 'spiritual side' right here. Unlike the excessively preachy &quot;Dark Horse&quot; or somewhat confusing mix that resolves into a decent album that is &quot;Extra Texture (Read All About It)&quot;, this album gets the tone, and the music, just right.<br />P.S.: Let's see the albums that the studios hated re-released, please! &quot;Thirty Three and One-Third&quot; is without question Harrison's other masterpiece, yet it's out of print while trash like &quot;Dark Horse&quot; is still around? News was Harrison was working on remastering his other albums (along with a secret project reportedly in the can... hope that sees the light of day)... so let's see them! Masterpieces like &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; or the last great supergroup that was The Traveling Wilburys need to get re-released again, in honor of our dear departed friend and quiet confidant, George Harrison.<br />RIP Dark Horse (1943-2001) &quot;What is this life without you?&quot;

B00004XQ83|5.0|It just owns everyone and everything.  Man of constant sorrow dominates my pants as well.
0062502182|5.0|I guess when something is of an extraordinary quality, its critics always go from one extreme to another, as is the case with this book. Some love it and others hate it with passion. There is nothing mediocre about it.This book is surely not for everyone. Not for people who are looking for some easy-read entertainment. Some reviewers have stated that this book is intended to &quot;brainwash&quot; readers, but I don't think that's the case. This book is not meant to be taken literally. It is meant to inspire us to think about spirituality and our own lives and it leaves enough space for everyone to interpert it in the way it applays to them as individuals. <BR>Also, the fact that this book was written in such a simple manner only adds to its beauty. Many readers have complained that this book is more suited for kids than adults, but to truly achieve greatness is to reduce complicated ideals, theories and beliefs to simple, to express them in simple terms. This book is intended to make a point, and that's exactly what it does. This is truly an extraordinary piece of literature!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I have read some of the negative reviews and choose to respectfully disagree with them.  I do not know how historically accurate some of the scenes are, but I did like the idea of making this an intensely personal crisis by zeroing in on characters who were in Hawaii at the time of the attacks.  There is a love story (or more accurately a triangle) and the viewer is introduced to young people whose idealism is only exceeded by their naivete.  Theirs is a world of flirting, young love, dancing, and parties.  Harsh reality soon sets in when the character played by Ben Affleck volunteers for duty with British fighter pilots who are already embroiled in war.  The other characters enjoy the good life in Hawaii until the attack brings them, too, into the terrible reality of war.  My advice would be to forget the pre-conceived notions of what you think this movie ought to be and enjoy the photography, special effects, and interaction of characters which makes this an entertaining movie.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Given that i have been a long time Incubus fan, i respect their change in style of music and look at it not as selling out, but letting their music mature. Morning view is the soft acoustic side of Incubus that they were so afraid to let out back in the family values tour. Even though I like their old style better, its still incubus and they have a magic to them that few other bands have. IF u want good lyrics and great singing look for morning view, if you want powerful hard hitting sounds check out SCIENCE. Itsn't good that incubus covers all areas of rock? ahh...well anyways if u don't like this Cd your probably a angry death metal guy who loved their old style..but i hafta tell you there's a lot more incubus to come. they've been life long friends and their definatly not about to give up, chances are their next albums will be very diffrent......
B00000K3CK|5.0|Miracle On 34th Street(1947) is without a doubt one of the best holiday films ever to be brought to the big screen, and has since become a family classic to many people all over.  As its theatrical trailer will atest, Miracle On 34th Street has everything: Comedy, Drama, Surprises, Suspense, Magic, Heart &amp; so much more!  <br />The DVD transfer is beautiful!  Nice and sharp and crisp.  Now I'm not someone who has a problem watching Black &amp; White films, but the original Miracle On 34th Street also had a colorized version, derived from a very impressive color transfer using computer technology.  I own this version on VHS (which sadly is out of print) and wondered why 20th Century Fox didn't just include both versions on the DVD?  Trust me, there's plenty of room on the disc for the black &amp; white and the colorized version.  I'll admit, many color versions of black &amp; white films are terrible (It's A Wonderful Life is the perfect example), but I was really impressed with the color version of 'Miracle.  The colors are rich and bright and the detail of the picture is still quite sharp and pristine.  I employ you, 20th Century Fox, to consider giving the public both the color and b&amp;w versions on DVD, just like the original A Christmas Carol(1951) was released (with both versions on one disc).  If both versions are put together, then people can decide for themselves if they want to watch it in black &amp; white or color, and you'll only broaden the films appeal by doing so.  Happy Holidays!<br />Miracle On 34th Street - A True Classic!<br />&quot;I believe...I believe...it's silly, but I believe&quot; - Natalie Wood as Susie Walker<br />PS - The scene with the little Dutch girl is my favorite!  :-)
B00003CXXJ|2.0|I don't see why everybody thought this was such a great accomplishment! It really was not very good at all. It sort of twisted on and on only to reveal a very predictable ending. A real dissapointmet.<BR>If you want to see something good, see monsters inc. It is definately worth seeing.
B00005QK3W|3.0|I have listened to all of Paul's solo albums many times (my favourites being Back to the Egg, Ram, Venus and Mars, Band on the Run and Flowers in the Dirt), so I pretty much know what I am talking about and why I am saying all I'm going to say. And I have given DR multiple listenings. <br />Lyrics have never bothered Paul, he has always said that they do not matter at all, the melody is important. That's what he has stuck to throughout his career. So, do not expect him to write some deep lyrics, that's simply not his domain. But to say that &quot;rock lyrics are typically undeep&quot; - hey, man, you've been listening to the wrong groups for sure!!! Listen to Roger Waters and you'll get the point, and never talk about what you don't know. <br />The voice... Oh God, that's really painful, though natural. I LOVE Paul's voice, it is one of the best voices in music. It was. Sorry... <br />Melodies... Who needs catchy melodies? The melodies must be beautiful and heartfelt, but why the hell do you people need catchy tunes? I loved some songs from the album - From A Lover To A Friend, She's Given Up Talking, Back In The Sunshine Again, Tiny Bubble, Heather are really nice. Rinse The Raindrops and About You are rocking - good!!! Your Way - great!!  But. A number of really typical and mediocre songs (sorry to say that, I am indeed sorry). These are I Do, It Must Have Been Magic, Loving Flame. They're just soooooo.. Usual. Grey. The others didn't attract my attention. <br />I felt that the production is a little bit overlooked here. It's a deliberately disheveled album, but IMHO it would have been better if Paul had worked on the production more, if he'd been more careful and ingenious with arrangements. <br />All in all, I haven't been expecting too much and I was neither pleasantly surprised, nor terribly disappointed. It's a good McCartney album, not the best, not the worst. But it lacks poignancy, and maybe inspiration of those albums that I have mentioned before.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Any Star Wars fan who has not seen this disaster need to avoid viewing it at all costs in order to maintain respect for the series.  This film is somewhere between the Teletubbies and Muppets in Space.  So be warned:  This film is marketed towards 6-10 year olds ala Harry Potter.  If you need a Star Wars fix, keep watching your VHS tapes of the real movies in the series.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Out of the two new tracks the live cut is cool the studio track is no prize but what can you do.  I always loved this album.  It is one of Priest's heaviest albums in terms of lyrics and music.  The new master of the album definitely kicks things up a notch.  You can hear things that weren't there before.  The album is just meaner, angry, more intense.  If this album had a soul it would be and evil one.  Buy it !!!!!!
B00004XOWM|5.0|This album is amazing!It is just the best album of 2000-2001.It has surpassed &quot;Significant Other&quot; and I will be looking forward to their next album. This album has everything, hard rock songs such as &quot;Full Nelson&quot; or &quot;My Way&quot; or even rap such as &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; maybe even anthems:&quot;Rollin'(Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; maybe serious songs e.g.&quot;Boiler&quot; and of course the mission impossible two soundtrack. I think the way DJ Lethal has mixed his decs in with the rock and how Fred Durst has mixed Hip Hop in. Warning! do not let the hip hop aspect frighten you rock lovers in my view the only really hip hop song is &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; featuring Xzibit. Which I much add is a pretty good track. The length of this album is seveny-five minutes! Which is obviously getting you the most bargain for money.I think this album is a lot better than the two before it. I think the lightening in the rock of Limp Bizkit was a wise decision, it adds more variety to their listeners an off course adding more fans.I think this has hours of listening pleasure and I hope for it to become a classic.
B00005B1EX|5.0|Judas Priest stinks without Halford!!!  This album is great its two CDS of Priest, Fight and Halford songs and they all sound awesome.  Its so much fun to listen to I can't help but smile.  After I heard Priest's new album Demolition that was no easy task.  Take the chance you have to hear the whole album to realize just what gem this is. Even the studio tracks are good, its just a great package.  Gold star for you Halford.
B000000OU0|4.0|Clem talks about a &quot;squiggley sound&quot; in HC on the DTS version. Well, it's clearly on the non-DTS original 1994 ADD CD too. At 1'52-1'55 secs. So, &quot;Get Over It&quot; [track 1]. ;-) Not defective at all.<br />As for the album, well, it's beautifully recorded, and works for me as &quot;nice music&quot; even if I'm not a big Eagles fan. Some of it is &quot;samey&quot;, for the non-hardened fan. Overall good stuff though. Nice &quot;evening music&quot; for chilling out to.
B00000293E|5.0|This CD is not valued by blues snobs for reasons that escape me when I think about it and are totally unfathonable when I listen to &quot;I am the Blues&quot;. It has the edge you associate with Sonny Boy or Wolf, the drive you find in Freddie King when he was produced by Leon Russell, and the power you feel when you are sitting at 2 am in a local blues bar and your favorite local band starts playing covers and you feel bulletproof. You may hide this CD when your blues loving friends drop by, BUT, this is the one you will listen to as you drive off into the night to raise a little hell.
0792140346|5.0|I had to view this movie for a class and can't say enough great things about it. I am in the psych field and even I was stumped by it. The acting, music and everything are thrilling!
0320037800|2.0|...The English version of the book is great... it's a treasure.  The French version is pritty dreadful and yet boring.  The translater did a poor job keeping the spirit & theme of Harry Potter alive.  Will hope the other books are better portaid in the French version as they are in the English one.
B000053V7Q|5.0|I just received this DVD from my girlfriend for my birthday.  What a pleasant surprise!  Rarely do we get to see Elvis in this manner.  We get to see the magic that was Elvis, both on and off stage.  This guy had star quality to back up his incredible talent.  It may surprise you to see just how down to earth this man was despite his enormous fame.  The way that the footage was assembled for this special edition gives the viewer the feeling that he/she is right there watching as Elvis and his band rehearse for a concert.  There is no commentary or interviews.  It's all Elvis, and it's all good.  If I had one complaint, it's with the bonus selections mentioned inside the case - I can't seem to find them!  There's 18 bonus selections listed.  (...)
B00004Z459|5.0|I had heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on MTV and decided that it would be nice to add something a little harder to my music collection.  I ordered it.  When it arrived I was completely surprised.  Hybrid Theory is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  The balance between vocals and hard core instrumental is amazing.  This is a definite buy.  If you like hard, loud music and good vocals than you will enjoy this album.
B00005OWIU|5.0|A superb soundtrack from the pen of the brilliant John Williams.  The music is absolutely magical (no pun intended).<br />The music is very much picturesque of Harry Potter and Hogwart's School.  If you like John Williams, you'll love this soundtrack.
B000002LK1|5.0|The first DM album I bought was Ultra, after which I bought Violator.  I had, of course, previously heard the well-known hits &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Violator&quot; and enjoyed them immensely, but I was largely unfamiliar with the terrain, as it were.  For some time, although I gave Violator hours of listening and soon also amassed a collection of nearly every DM release, I would have ranked Ultra at the top.  Now, giving Violator a close re-listening after a few years of losing touch with it, I have re-discovered its absolute greatness, and I would rank it at the top of my list of DM favorites and probably even at the top of my all time favorite albums EVER.  &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; remains a personal favorite, but each and every song on this album is amazing.  It is one of a few albums that I am actually able to listen to straight through without doing any skipping around, and I have been known to listen to the album straight through repeatedly, for hours at atime.  I would also rate &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; as an absolutely fantastic song; it probably surpasses &quot;Enjoy the Silence,&quot; at least in my mind.  I can't recommend this album enough.
B000002KKD|5.0|I don't know anyone who owns this disc who doesn't play the spots off of it regularly.  The musicianship isn't exactly virtuoso... but these tunes get under your skin.  I can't listen to a single track and sit still.  The lyrics are sometimes just nonsense, but the way they're performed here they take on the urgency of some Springsteen anthem:<br />Somebody went under a dock, and there they saw a rock.<br />But it wasn't a rock.....<br />It was a ROCK LOBSTER!!!!<br />Words can't do this recording justice.... but how many people already familiar with &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; mentally started twanging out the guitar riff upon reading the above lyrics?<br />DOW-DOW-DOW duh-duh dih-duh dih-duh!!!<br />Most of the tunes on this disc when played publicly, will immediately result in a loud cheerful whoop of recognition, followed by quickly moving feet.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Some of the best Beatles songs available -- great to have on 1 disc.  Sound is good.
B000007RV5|5.0|Its great. This album is the best from Limp Bizkit. We love Limp Bizkit and want to see them in Russia.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Since we've all &quot;had enough&quot; of Titanic, yet apparently not entirely, otherwise why would these other movies be successful?  <br />While being a bit idealistic and an imitation of Titanic at times, I still loved this movie.  The acting of Kate Beckinsale is a lot more polished than Kate Winslet's performance in Titanic, if you ask me.  And two of the hottest actors star in this 3 hour film, so what more could you ask?  <br />My friends cried buckets when we went to see this in the theater.  Of course we all expect tragedy from this movie - I mean, look at the title!  And some of you may be sick of those sappy endings, morals, and whatever, but I think this movie worked it in pretty well.  The plot incorporated humor and action to spice up the old love triangle - people have said that this movie could have ended in ten different places, but it just kept dragging on.  ...That is kinda true, but we can't just leave the story at the handicap of Pearl Harbor, right?  And the love thing still had to be settled.  <br />...Well, Titanic never had the entire audience satisfied either...give Pearl Harbor a try and see for yourself.  I think it's worth seeing and it's one of the best movies out recently - critics will at least agree that it was a good shot and good entertainment.
B000007RV5|5.0|I think it is the great album from Limp Bizkit. Its very hard. Many people in Russia love Limp Bizkit and want to see them here!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004YYDI|5.0|No women and no children, right? Wrong! This film should not be missed by anyone. Superiority, outstanding acting, impeccable soundtrack, and &lt;&lt;un cot bougant&gt;&gt; spring to mind. Luc Besson hasn't put a foot wrong to date, and this represents the pinnacle of his unblemished career.<BR>The principle is highly original: the &quot;best assassin in town&quot; - an Italian by the name of Lon (Jean Reno)- who is highly set in his routine of training and care enconters one day an arguement outside his shady appartment door: a pathetic drug horder and his dysfunctional family being threatened at the hands of a seriously weird and viciously corrupt D.E.A. officer (Gary Oldman), who has no qualms in killing anyone who stands in his way, or for that matter slightly annoys him. Under the pressure of all this, and repeatedly abused by her family, 12 year Mathilda (outstandingly portrayed by Natalie Portman of Star Wars fame) comes home from shopping one day to find blood and armed thugs coming out of her appartment - her entire family having been ruthlessly gunned down by Stansfield (Oldman).<BR>In an attempt to conceal her real identity she begs for Leon to open his door to her. When he does, the most incredible tale begins - Mathilda begs him to train her in his dark art, but along side all this are normal interests 12 year girls have (watching cartoons, dressing up as film stars and so on), giving the viewer a bizarre sense that there's nothing wrong with their &quot;profession.&quot; Initially reluctant, Leon eventually gives, and gives Mathilda the love she could never have had at home. <BR>The remainder of this mind-blower revolves around Mathilda's intent on taking out Stansfield, purely for the murder of her baby brother. All the while, Leon remains the Professional, protecting Mathilda from anyone and everyone, whilst their bond grows.<BR>As per Besson film, there are a lot of morals, ideas and very penetrating thoughts to be had here - the action quietly switches from Leon's cold, amoral assassin to water-fights in his appartment with Mathilda. The sheer scope of ideas in this film is incredible, and, without question, the thing that makes it work so well is the photography. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of THOSE films where the camera angle is perfectly cast given the temperament of the movie. Yes, I'm afraid this is one helluva flick. <BR>I can't pin down in a brief review what makes this film so god damn good - it's possible to write an encyclopaedia on what makes this one work. The casting is so good its annoying; the soundtrack by Sting, Billy Joel and Eric Clapton is very moving and well used (when Leon is walking towards his light at the end of his tunnel - I don't want to spoilt the VERY dramatic ending - the careful use of the music is admirable). I can watch the &quot;fat guy&quot; opening over and over, and the film is never in the slightest bit slow, despite there being so many personal bits in it. <BR>So, you have your orders, people.  Watch this film. Then watch it again, and again, and again....
B00005QFE5|4.0|Try to endure the monochrome prologue and epilogue portions of this movie. It'll be worth it because the core of this movie is a brightly colored flashback to a Chinese village in the 1950's. The story is essentially one long flirtation as a young woman over the course of four seasons tries to win the attention of the new schoolteacher.<br /><br />This was Planet Earth's introduction to the delightful Zhang Ziyi (or, for Westerners expecting the family name last: Ziyi Zhang). It is hard to believe that this exuberant girl is played by the same actress who later played the dour whirlwind in [[ASIN:B00003CXR4 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]].<br /><br />Just as it was inevitable that the schoolteacher fall in love with the young woman, it was inevitable that legions of movie-going Earthlings would fall in love with Zhang Ziyi.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I have had no problems playing this great CD on my computer. I use Real Jukebox (the free download) and everything works fine. Highly recommended.
0140067477|4.0|This book suits those with an interest in philosophy or Taoism in particular who also like a nice, easy read from time to time.  There will always be those who dislike having such a serious subject equated with something so childlike, and yet that is what Taoism is all about--the childlike way of viewing the world, accepting reality for what it is rather than trying to force it to be what we want it to be.<br />For those new to Taoism, it opens the door to a different way of viewing the world.  To those not so new to it, it's a refreshing, fun take on the subject.  This book is intended to explain the basic concepts of the philosophy.  For those looking for an analytical or in-depth book on the subject, you need to look elsewhere.
B00005QAPH|4.0|I will let others speak to the artistic merits of the film and I will only say that I have had the pleasure to enjoy it a few times in the theater over the years.  This is a dvd I have looked forward to for some time and the quality of the Criterion transfer is outstanding, although I did get a little digital weirdness from time to time.  For example, when the film director goes airborne in the beginning, his coat would fracture a bit in motion--very minor and not really distracting.  But here's the rub--I'm getting so tired of inaccurate info on these discs--the cover states the film is presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio--one look at my tv and it was obviously not 1.85--I got out a ruler and measured--result was 1.60:1.  Now that's close to 1.66:1, which is European widescreen and likely the proper aspect ratio--with the delays in the release of the disc, why can't they get these details right.  I have a region 2 copy of this disc from the u.k.--a basic edition-- and I popped it in to compare with the Criterion disc.  It was widescreen as well--and it measured about 1.90:1--which is pretty close to the 1.85 Criterion claimed--I believe you see more of the frame at the top and bottom in 1.66 anyway if you're worried that image was cropped.  It seems so strange that the American disc is presented in the European 1.66 and the U.K. disc is in the American 1.85 ratio.  The region 2 u.k. disc was also a little less contrasty and so you could see detail a bit better in the shadows, but the image itself was also a bit softer and didn't have the crispness of the Criterion.  This is really a minor complaint in the end, but Criterion has a low number of new releases and I think it is reasonable to hold them to a high standard in both their transfers and their information.
B00005LOUS|5.0|The Grinch was the best movie that I've seen since the Wizard of Oz. To all the people who hate this movie, I have to say, \\"Nobody (cares) if you like the outdated, boring, stupid, Boris Karloff version better.\\" Leave Jim Carrey and Ron Howard alone. It's not their fault that you didn't like this film. It's your seeing it in the first place that made you not like it.

B00000HYXB|5.0|First, for that one guy who said &quot;it's not progressive...&quot;, well, It shouldn't be. Blind Guardian is power metal, not progressive rock. Although Dream Theater does rock, you insisted someone buying their albums...well, metal fans would prefer Blind Guardian.<br />This is BG's second best release yet, thus the first is Imaginations From The Other Side, as it has Mordred's Song, the title track and many others.<br />Nightfall, Into The Storm, Mirror Mirror, Thorn, Time Stands Still, The Eldar, A Dark Passage, Curse Of Feanor, Noldor and When Sorrow Sang are the best...mind you, most of the leftovers are narrations to help you through the album, which is a concept.<BR>This album is my third all-time favorite, as my first is Pain Of Salvation's 'Perfect Element Pt.1' and my second is Dream Theater's 'Metropolis Pt.2: Scenes From A Memory', and my fouth, Iced Earth's 'Horror Show' and finally my fifth is Iced Earth's 'Something Wicked...'

B000000WA4|5.0|I am, to date, a pretty solid pumpkinhead.  I do not have all the albums, but am eager to deepen my obssession with this fantastic band.  That said, I will talk about Mellon Collie.  This was my first Smashing Pumpkins album.  I shamefully admit to listening to the singles first, but as time has gone by, I have grown to love nearly every track on the album.  Brilliant lyrics, compelling melodies, complex and textured arrangments, and (of course) a healthy dose of angst, can be found in nearly every song.  This is pretty near to definitive Smashing Pumpkins.  The only Smashing Pumpkins album that surpasses it is Siamese Dream.  <BR>   Some of my favorite tracks include: The beautiful, hopeful &quot;Tonight,tonight,&quot; the bleak headbanger &quot;Zero,&quot; the majestic &quot;Here is no Why,&quot; the overplayed but great &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings,&quot; the soothing &quot;Galapagos,&quot; the grungy, angsty masterpiece &quot;Muzzle,&quot; the epic &quot;Porcelina,&quot; the brilliantly dark &quot;Where Boys fear to Tread,&quot; and &quot;x.y.u.,&quot; the wistful classic &quot;1979,&quot; and others.  I've talked for too long.  Purchase this album and join the pumpkinheads.<BR>     --Jack
B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en is, in my opinion, the best directed film ever.  Perhaps had the subject matter been less grisly, multiple awards would've been won.  ...<br />The gruesome story about a serial killer who murders by the seven deadly sins is an incredibly smart film that no doubt was intensely researched.  Andrew Kevin Walker's script is rife with great dialog, interesting twists, and very well researched pathology and literatue references.<br />David Fincher had a highly successful music video career before this, but this film truly showed his brilliance.  Everything is dark and haunting.  The camerawork fits the situation perfectly, from the steady flowing shots in the calm before the storm to the highspeed handhelds in the chases and intense sequences.  He is a master of his surroundings and the direction is a terrific showcase of the dark territory this film moves into.<br />The performances are equally impressive.  Morgan Freeman turns in his usual great job, but Brad Pitt is truly an awesome force.  At first I thought that a lot of his acting in certain scenes was slightly cheesy, but in subsequent viewings it's easy to see where every bit of acting came from.  This is his show all the way.  Gwyneth Paltrow is warm and gives the right amount of emotion that is needed to counteract the gruesome parts of the movie.  Having truly earned his reputation for playing psychos through this film, Kevin Spacey is menacing in a very intellectual way, and it is perfect for the role.  He's smart and calculating, but you can see that's his character is just a powder keg waiting to explode.<br />Overall this is an incredible film.  It has great direction, acting writing, and especially production design.  The film is haunting and dark.  Everything is cluttered in the right ways and sparce where it needs to be.  David Fincher should be commended.  He has made a truly excellent film.  It would be a shame to pass this one up because of its subject matter.
B000002L68|5.0|I have loved a lot of Prince's music over the years, but &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is definitely my personal favorite out of all his albums.  The songs on this album are still as fresh today as they were in the 1980's.  Few 80's artists made the impact on the music industry that Prince did.  Only Madonna and Michael Jackson give him competition at all.<br />&quot;Purple Rain,&quot; &quot;Darling Nikki,&quot; and &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; are only a couple of the brilliant songs you can find on this cd.  All three are pretty revolutionary for their time.  Give this cd a try if you haven't already experienced it.  A+
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I don't have the words to say how moving the film &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; is.  The film and soundtrack are brilliant.  This is definitely Bjork at her best.  Very few artists today have the bold talent that little Bjork does.  I have nothing but praise for her, and for this album.  Get it today. A+
B000000OQF|5.0|I purchased this Tape when I was 12 years old.I would listen to it every day after school . I think I actually made it through junior high school because of this album. It is one of the albums you never get sick of or the &quot;Desert Island album&quot; I can pop it  in the cd player in my car and the music is still as good as it was in 1987. This album could easily be one of the best of all time.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Quite stunning collection especially for the inclusion of Echoes, Shine On and the Barrett work (delighted to see Jugband Blues and See Emily Play).just a few problems namely the presence of Sorrow and Learning to Fly especially when gems like Remember A Day, Wots The Deal, Fearless,The Gunners Dream,Two Suns in the Sunset, Flaming and Cirrus Minor are missing. <BR>Any fans of Beta Band, Radiohead, Primal Scream, The Orb etc buy this without hesitation.<BR>Just remains to be said that EMI should be bombraded with emails demanding the release of the Barrett era rarities that are rotting away in the vaults namely Apples and Oranges,Paintbox Candy and a Currant Bun, Lucy Leave, Scream Thy Last Scream, Vegetable Man and the other live/altenate tracks (Careful with that Axe Eugene, Point Me At The Sky etc).
B00005A1PR|5.0|This album must be the best album I've ever heard. I saw India on the late show with David Letterman or was it Jay Leno? Anyhow, I fell like a rock for the song Video. Ran directly to the Cd-store, listened through and bought the CD. IT'S THE GREATEST!! I wish I could rate it even higher than 5 stars. I just love it. She's got a great voice. Very nice India, already waiting for the next album
B000055Y0X|5.0|If you have not seen a clean print of this film, you do not know ANYthing about film, comedy, history or just about anything else!  The DVD provides the BEST copy of the film I've seen to date, plus more goodies than you could expect for a film done nearly four decades ago!  I am amazed that so much extra material survived the studio system.  Priceless...
B000002HJA|5.0|They had to go make a cd that exceeds all of their former albums, leaving me with MANY hours of anti-social behaviour, locking myself in my room and listening to the album 24 7.<br />I know many will disagree when I say this cd is was the Kyuss' musical peek. &quot;Sky Valley&quot; is loved by many, and believe me, it is as close to perfection one can get.<BR>But &quot;...And the circus leaves town&quot; takes their musical performance to and beyond perfection. My personal favourites are &quot;Tangy Zizzle&quot;, &quot;One inch man&quot; and &quot;Catamaran&quot;. <BR>I have yet to find a song that walks the line between calm, steady rythms and hard, beautiful rock as good as &quot;Catamaran&quot;.<br />While I'm writing this review, let me express my affection to the future legends, Tool. If you still haven't heard the deeply emotional music of Opiate, Undertow, Ænema (especially) and Lateralus, You have missed out on what could be your ultimate musical experiance. It may take some time to digest, but when you have, you will be awarded. Believe you me...<br />(Pardon my french, I'm Norwegian)
B000002IRL|4.0|Very heavy thrash album. Highlights include: Soulitude, Coma, and Thanx for Nothin'. The other songs are solid as well. If you're a first time Overkill buyer, then go first for The Years of Decay - their definitive album. Albums released after this don't hold up to the standards here. Then again, metal died in 1991 following Slayer's classic Seasons album and grunge took over. Sure there were stragglers who continued to put out albums, Overkill included. Which leads me to the question: how many times can a band put out essentially the same album with only small variations on the same theme? Hey, AC/DC has made a career of it. They wrote one song and put out 20 albums with the same exact style. Sure you always know it's AC/DC, but at which point do you stop caring - when the put out complete tripe like &quot;Stiff Upper LiP&quot;?

0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe is a masterful story teller.  <BR>In the Nigerian tradition, Achebe crafts a tale of Okonkwo, a strong man who cannot change.  More than that, the reader is brought within the realm of pre-contact African society, specifically Umuofia.  <BR>Achebe drops his reader into the midst of this society often without explaination or apology, immersing him in a true 'sink or swim' environment.  <BR>Although this edition contains a glossary for the various Ibo words and phrases sprinkled throughout, flipping back and forth would disrupt the flow of the narrative and become rather annoying.  Instead, I advise the reader to trust the author.  Achebe is a talented man and you won't be left in the dark for long.  <BR>Achebe's diction and skillfull description make this a truly unique story and, understandably, a modern classic.
0060934719|1.0|First, let me express that I am certainly a fan of Gaiman's work, and have read a great deal that he's written. From \\"The Sandman\\" to \\"Neverwhere\\" (including \\"Black Orchid\\", \\"Mr. Punch\\", \\"Angels & Reflections\\", \\"Death\\", and others), I have thoroughly enjoyed the way this man puts together characters, stories, plots, scenes, and settings. I have just enjoyed so much that he's done.<br />I fully expected to enjoy this book, but was sorely disappointed. Why, you might ask? (...) It's a rambling narrative set in a poorly explored and half-imagined world of fairy tale magic and Carroline witticisms. Please, let me explain.<br />The most specific criticism I have is that the plot meanders from one conflict to another without ever fully realising any real tension; instead of allowing the characters to overcome their own challenges, they are offered weak and easy \\"outs\\" from all of their difficulties (deus ex machina); or, in the case of the final and expected confrontation at the end of the book (that was slowly built towards throughout), the antagonist witch simply perishes before the protagonists are allowed to reach her and engage in any appreciable and entertaining skirmish.<br />Characters are too easily introduced and abandoned, settings are drifted through without rhyme or reason, conflict and comedy are whispered of and are gone... Every word in this book puts me in mind of an episodic story a grandparent might tell a young child at bedtime: the events of the previous nights' episodes are too readily forgotten; the details are fanciful and unimportant, grasped at in a desperate attempt to fill an evening; the ending obligatory, uninspired and uninspiring.<br />I urge anyone interested in Neil Gaiman to not be discouraged by this book or this review. He is a good author, and worthy of your attention. This particular tale though, is best left to gather dust.
B000002KHY|1.0|I loved this record, but the version of steam roller includes [some profanity].  So, I won't play it around my kids or even many of my friends.  Call me a prude, but its a shame that this was included in an otherwise great collection of work.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I liked the movie.....I think it was well done. It is a difficult task to make a movie about such a well known subject concerning American history. The story line is good....it takes many known aspects of the period into account. There is a bit of dramatic license taken, but how else are you going to make the film? There are too many people involved for the film to reflect everyone's actual experience with that event. Generalizations and assumptions were made....they had to be made. That is the film makers job. I challenge anyone who wants to try to better the attempt to go ahead....show me better. Then we will talk!<BR>Ta ta for now!<br />Bill
0385505833|4.0|I got this book for my birthday. It's not heavy reading but it's a fun distraction from the holidays. I really laughed out loud to how the neighbors gave Luthur The grief about not puting up a frosty on his house. This book will apeal to the small inner Grinch that appears inside all of us during all the holiday hoopla.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I would venture to say that most people were expecting \\"Pearl Harbor\\" to be an action-packed, full-fledged war film similar to Patton.  \\"Pearl Harbor\\" clearly wasn't a film about war.  Yes, it did have plenty of action-packed war chorography, but after all, we are talking about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor here.  But it is not a film about war.  It's a film about people.<br />In order for any story to be told properly, we need to be familiar with the characters.  In this film, in particular, the characters need to be more than just people in a story.  You need to feel the pain the characters are going through.  Seeing a pile of corpses carries more of an emotional weight if the audience has a chance to become familar with them.  Far too many times in war films, we see corpses as faceless individuals.  Well, they're not faceless to our *real* unsung heros. <br />Pearl Harbor *is* an excellent film.  It made me laugh, made me cry... it made me feel exactly like people felt during that \\"day that will live in infamy.\\"
B000002W9P|4.0|Let me start by saying that this was the first Helloween album I bought. After watching the video of 'Halloween' which was MUCH shorter than the album version I thought I would give this band a try. The intro/opening song are great and I always thought would be a good concert opener as well. But when I heard the track 'A Little Time' I was hooked. It is still my favorite Helloween song to this day and shows Kiskes strong vocals at their best. The rest of the album is good as well. 'Twilight Of The Gods' and 'A Tale That Wasn't Right' are good examples of the great song writting of the band.<br />Now for the actual song 'Halloween'. The song is long but well structured. From the first verse and chorus all the way through the bridge in the song it does not seem to be 13 minutes long as there is not filler solos in there but actual riffs/changes that make the song much better. By the way,if you can ever see/hear the much shorter video version you will find that it is laid out pretty good and features a &quot;regular&quot; structure of a song,that is a verse,chorus,bridge,solo,verse and end. Hard to believe they could make a 13 minute song into 4-5 minutes but it was done.<br />One final note. In my opinion you would be much better off to start with Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part 2 as it is the album that made Helloween &quot;known&quot; and they even had a tour with Anthrax/Exodus for awhile. Add the fact that it's single &quot;I Want Out&quot; got pretty good exposure along with the experimental &quot;Dr Stein&quot; and you will see why it is in MY opinion the best Kiske era Helloween cd you can buy.<br />Wait,isn't this a Keeper 1 review????????
6304698658|4.0|One of Chevy's best -- and my personal favorite of the Vacation series. Clark Griswold is at his most well-intentioned but dim-witted best in this one. This movie has lots of strong gags throughout. Just when you think the story is about to lose steam, Randy Quaid shows up -- and the comedy goes to a whole new level. (My favorite scene is still the &quot;sled&quot; ride into traffic). Top notch supporting work from Beverly D'Angelo, and especially William Hickey and Mae Questel (as the great-grandparents).<br />This DVD was made back in the days when &quot;extras&quot; meant trailers, and maybe some production notes. This is also a full-screen prsentation which is bad news for those of us who care about such things. Hopefully a &quot;Special Edition&quot; of this Christmas classic will be released with commentary from the stars, a widescreen picture and any out-takes that might possibly exist.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|This album is so brilliant, that it is hardly describable by words. It boasts many huge guests and fine musicians such as Robert Fripp ( of King Crimson), Pete Townshend of the Who and Carlos Alomar (Bowie's bandleader). Every track is good, but the tracks Scary Monsters, Ashes to Ashes, Teenage Wildlife, Scream Like a Baby, and Because You're Young, are some of the finest of his career. This personally my favorite album, having brilliant, yet disturbing, paranoid lyrics, but fantastic singing showcasing his range and ideas from other albums into one of absolute peaking brilliance. This album will disturb you, scare you, delight you and about everything else. It has satires, influences of metal, classic rock, glam rock, soul, blues, and about every other kind of music very very successfully melded. THis is not a good Bowie to start with as it takes much getting used to but if you like it then i recommend Low, Heroes, and Lodger, his three eno, berlin period albums, all of them are great. It doesn't get much better than this, this is the finest of wine, the most expensive of gold. If you purchase this you'll not be disappointed. It's too bad that after this his career declined until a brilliant ressurection with Outside, i'm not sure if i'm allowed to recommend this , but if u like read my review on Outside and maybe you'll decide to give that one a shot too.
B000002UR7|3.0|I must admit it right up front; I am a big Radiohead fan.  And I do like this CD.  But I heard &quot;Creep&quot; so many times on the radio, that I really can't stand to hear it any more.  As great as Radiohead really is, they have only gotten better with time, as other albums like &quot;OK Computer&quot;, &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; are.  For anyone interested in this album, expect a more overtly angry tone than other Radiohead albums provide.  This was, after all, where Radiohead got its start (if you discount the &quot;Drill&quot; EP), and as such they hadn't quite figured out exactly who they were angry at yet.  Still, a great debut for a band that is arguably (and, in my own biased, yet humble, opinion) one of the most innovative of the last 20 years.  It's very interesting to pop all 5 Radiohead albums in the CD changer, hit PLAY, and listen to how they have refined both their message and the direction of their anger.  Radiohead is not an angst-band; they are a band concerned with where we are going as a species, and what we are doing to one another.
B000000W9Z|5.0|I'm an absolutely huge David Bowie fan and worship nearly his whole discography, so it's hardly fair for me to rate something, but i will try to give my fairest evaluation. I feel that this album is his strongest album in years, and is not only strong but a brilliant must have for other diehard fans. It has a very well thought out concept, while bizarre, is very interesting. The music definetly has the industrial metal influence to it. Many great songs form a fantastic album here. Outside is very disturbing but anyone with an open mind will love it. Throughout it has many segues, explaining the storyline, mostly done by Bowie himself. His old friend or associate, brian eno (from the berlin albums, low, heroes, and lodger) teams up wiht him again for a brilliant 5 star album, hopefully not his last brilliant album.
0140186395|5.0|I love John Steinbeck and have never know another author I've enjoyed so much. He gets a little carried away at times with descriptions of his homeland, but this is by far the greatest novel ever written. If you truely want a review of this book just start by reading the dedication. I believe he says it all there.
0385505833|3.0|In his second consecutive departure from his wildly successful legal thrillers (following &quot;A Painted House&quot;, a really good book!) John Grisham presents a modern Christmas fable in &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;. With their only child away from home in the Peace Corps, Luther and Nora Krank, actually mostly Luther--Nora follows along weakly--decide to forego the usual round of Christmas parties, cards, house decorating, shopping, cooking and general madcap whirl to take a Caribbean cruise. This creates a little (very!) admiration, some envy and a lot of anger among their co-workers, friends and neighbors. I must admit some curmudgeonly sympathy with the Kranks in their attempt to go a different direction. But what Grisham intends, I think, to be a light, funny reminder of the important themes underlying our too commercialized holidays, becomes, for me, off-putting. The neighbors with their anger over Luther's refusal to put up a snowman on his roof, are way too serious a reminder of suburban conformity run amuck to be truly funny. There is a Jim Carrey movie waiting to be born here: funny, slapsticky and rather mean. I don't think that is what Grisham intended.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Truly an excellent, excellent dvd!  No fan of animation or anyone who likes fun movies should pass this one by.  I've watched it numerous times and I am still enjoying it.  A very complete package with both pan and scan on one disk and widescreen on the other.  Both discs feature lots and lots of supplemental material as well as the alternate(?) ending of the movie with the charcters singing kareoke!!  If you loved Shrek in the theater, then you MUST have this one for your collection.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I was there at the beginning of the tour..first show in Jersey..and let me tell you, this live HBO special comes as close to capturing the essence of Bruce and the E Streeters as you'll ever see on DVD. <br />I'm sure most of you who are reading this are Springsteen fans, but if you're not...GET this and you will be. This a MUST have for fans of rock music who want to see the best performer on the face of the earth.  at 53, Springsteen's shows are longer than most bands who started in the 90's.<br />Welcome to E Street!
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I think Shore did a wonderful job on this. The music is very well composed and has a deep feeling to it that feels like you can really feel the music, or understand what's going on even though we haven't seen the movie yet.<br />This soundtrack has a classical sound to it, mixed with a mysterious, yet very magastic sound. The vocal parts in it do wonders for this cd. It brings out the deep feeling to it that also helps bring out the melody. Like in the songs The Prophecy and especially Shadow of the Past. The cd also has very sweet, mellow sounding songs like Concerning Hobbits, which is my favorite of the cd. It has a violin solo in it that is played, and written very well. Another great piece is The Black Rider. It starts out as a mellow sounding peice, then goes into the deep vocal sounds.<br />Howard Shore did a great job for this this movie. They style of the music goes well with Tolkiens work cause Tolkien has that &quot;classical&quot;, &quot;fantasy&quot; feeling to it that requires fantasy/classical type music to it. This muisc really moves the heart and soul and makes other composers seem little.
6305041156|5.0|Aged warlord Hidetori Ishimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), influenced by an ominous vision, rashly decides to divide House Ishimonji between his three sons. His youngest son Saburo objects, understanding both the true nature of his ambitious brothers and knowing full well that his father's decision  would likely mean the end of everything the old warlord has fought for. He speaks his mind, and is disowned for doing so. Yet he was prophetic. Within weeks his brothers are plotting war and conquest, and Hidetori finds himself relegated to the background, ignored and disrespected. War breaks out, and as the destruction mounts on both sides, Hidetori slowly descends into madness. <br />Some have alleged that this is King Lear transported to feudal Japan. Kurosawa did borrow from Shakespeare (not just Lear but also MacBeth) , but mixed into the plot elements from Japanese mythology and history, as well as his own feelings about loyalty. The end result is stunning to behold. Kurosawa's mastery of the cinematic art isshowcased here; not since \\"The Seven Samurai\\" has he produced a film of such epic scope and power. Kurosawa's plot borrows liberally from \\"King Lear,\\" adds the 16th century Japanese legend of Motonari Mori, and incorporates elements from Japanese history, particularly the frequent conflicts between warlords that plagued the country's feudal era. <br />As Hidetori, Nakadai gives a sensational performance; one can see in him the powerful warlord who conquered all in his sight, and his descent into madness is both wrenching and fascinating. Here is a man who is unable to comprehend that the destruction of all he fought for is his own fault; in his ruthless conquests he made innumerable enemies, and the primary lessons he taught his sons are those of violence, greed, and destruction. He ultimately reaps what he has sown, perhaps drowning in his own hubris. Yet Nakadai and Kurosawa let us sympathize a bit with Hidetori; in him we see the possibility of redemption and forgiveness. Indeed, Hidetori's exiled youngest son exemplifies those qualities when he comes looking for his father, not seeking revenge but hoping to relieve him of his madness. <br />Although Hidetori is the principal character, the plot also revolves around Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), the wife of eldest son Taro. In her we have touches of both Lady MacBeth and Machiko Kyo (from Kurosawa's \\"Rashomon\\"), a woman of stunning evil and manipulative subtlety whose desire for revenge (her family was slaughtered by  Hidetori) is so consuming that she will do anything to achieve it. When her husband is killed, she immediately turns her attention to Jiro, the middle son. In one of the film's defining moments, she first holds a knife to Jiro's throat...then seduces him on the floor...and soon after, she demands the death of the gentle Lady Sue, Jiro's wife. She manipulates Jiro into rash decisions, knowing that the ultimate result of her actions may be what she seeks: the total destruction of House Ichimonji. Harada's performance is outstanding, both emotionally powerful and charged with subtle eroticism; she's demure and polite one minute, seductive the next. Her ultimate fate is not at all surprising, and perhaps expected. <br />Religion is a central element, embodied in  Lady Sue's adherence to the ways of the Buddha in lieu of her desire for revenge...for her family was also murdered by Hidetori. Her devotion to her blind brother and her loyal lady servant is so strong that she risks death to ensure their safety.  <br />In terms of direction, Kurosawa once again proves he is one of the genre's legends. We have scenes of both colorful beauty (Kurosawa makes good use of the gorgeous Japanese countryside) and shocking violence. The apocalyptic battle scenes are kinetic, bloody, and extraordinarily well-choreographed. An interesting touch is the use of silence during the battles, a welcome contrast to both traditional action films (whose goal seems to be to make everyone in the world tone-deaf) and the battle segments that do have sound. Each major event in the film is accompanied by changes in the weather, much like \\"King Lear\\". Rolling, boiling clouds and sudden winds are frequently used throughout the story. The film's striking use of color and makeup was largely influenced by traditional Noh drama, and much credit must be given to those responsible for costume and production design; rarely has a film had such potent visual elements seamlessly incorporated into its plot and structure. All in all, an epic of incredible proportions, a memorable effort from Japan's master filmmaker. Fans of this may also like Kurosawa's other films, such as \\"The Seven Samurai,\\" \\"The Hidden Fortress,\\" (an influence for \\"Star Wars\\"), and \\"Rashomon.\\" The melodramatic miniseries \\"Shogun\\" deals with roughly the same time period; for those who like Shakespeare and epic battles, see Kenneth Branagh's masterful \\"Henry V.\\"
B00005OWIU|3.0|I wouldn't consider it one of John William's best scores, but it does have some wonderfuly written peices like Hegwarts Theme to just name one. The beginning of the soundtrack is very good (that's why it give it a 3 rating) but as you get towards the end of the soundtrack, you lose interest in the music because the melody isn't has strong as the beginning nor does it have enough difference between intraments. This is rather unusal for Williams because he usalley is very good at doing this. <br />I think Williams does better at the non childrens movies like Schindlers list, Jurrasic Park, Jaws, Indian Jones, ect. The songs from those have a more deeper 'realistic sound' then much of the Harry Potter CD which seems to lean towars the more childis, almost 'corney' sound that doesn't seem to do well. <br />The good side is that he created a WONDERFUL theme song to this movie that does goes well with the movie and I think it will be a remembered peice like the Jurrasic Park theme, or Jaws theme.
B00005J9U1|5.0|This is a great CD with a great combination of songs. Its good if you want to hear your favorite marley songs without having to buy each individual CD. The sound quality is also great.
B00003CXTG|5.0|What can I say--IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE!  It had every emotion in it and I have already seen it 5 times!!!  GREAT!GREAT!GREAT! It probably helped that Ben Affleck is soooo HOT in the movie!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is one of the best CD's ever written. The songs are really easy to relate to, and there is just about a song for every emotion. Happiness: The Best Thing, Chained to You, Affirmation, The Animal Song. Sadness: Hold Me, You Can Still Be Free, Two Beds and a Coffee Machine, Crash and Burn, I Dont Know You Anymore. Anger: Gunning Down Romance. Embarassment: Crash and Burn. In Love: I Knew I Loved You, Chained To You, The Best Thing. Craziness: The Animal Song, Chained to You.
0790729369|5.0|This movie is a wonderful love story! Keep the tissue handy..
6301442962|5.0|This movie is one of the best for the holidays.  It makes the Christmas season seem more wonderful.  Seeing this is as heartwarming and magical as a movie can get.  The acting is superb as well as the directing and writing.  Anyone who doesn't like this is a grump.  Life is full of magic , just look for it.
B000002U82|5.0|When over 600 persons write about an album and that album is &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; there is not too much that can be added. I think this probably is one of those &quot;Ten albums I'd take to a desert island&quot; but on top of that, intentionally or not, the album (a continuous stream of music from beginning to end) happens to fit PERFECTLY the story of the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;... as a soundtrack! Try this: Start the movie without sound; when the Warner Bros lion roars for the third time, press PLAY on your CD player; sit back and be amazed... Coincidence? I seriously doubt it, even more since you can play the CD on a loop and the synchronicity is maintained. The band has never admitted to it, but this is something that only proves once again that the Floyd are brilliant!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Disney did a great job by making all of this DVD a great experience.  Try just letting the DVD &quot;sit&quot; there for a few minutes on the menu screen.  The mirror has some really funny wisecracks.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Such a breath of fresh air.  Other than great hooks, the best thing about the strokes is that they don't seem to take themselves too seriously.  A little bit Lou, a liitle bit Jim Carroll, a little bit NY Dolls, a little bit Flipper.  Best guitar record since Frank Black's last effort.  Perhaps, they can resurrect real music?
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Original Plot, great acting (Pantoliano was awesome). The twist at the ending still remains on my mind. Great editing, and eerie music, What a classic!!. The best thriller of recent years!. The final line of Pearce character was the best of the year!!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I had heard a lot of the negative reviews on this film ranging from its absurd length to the &quot;sappiness&quot; of its love story.  Well, that's what remotes are far.  Yet that aside, the action sequences in this film are unbelievable and bring out both the viciousness of the attack itself as well as the stories of hope and courage and all that - of bravery - that most all of the soliders who were there that day lived through.  It's a great piece of work in that respect.
B00000ING2|5.0|I think I have figured out why the quality of this film is so heavily disputed: It is a comedy without jokes. Everything onscreen, from the characters to the sets to--especially to--the dialogue is so incredibly amusing that many folks cannot seem to comprehend what the film is doing. I'll enlighten those who have yet to enjoy the majesty of this film: It isn't cracking mundane, vulgar, stereotypical gags like every other film, it is reinventing humor, redesignating what is funny, what it takes to make the audience laugh. You can't watch five minutes of this film and find it humorous, because everything about it is an experiment in new and interesting ways to amuse a crowd; obviously they can't please everyone, but for me the film has become my all time favorite comedy.<br />Humor, as defined by the Coens, is more obscure than you or your Webster's considers it. For them, humor is an all encompassing showcase that cannot be taken apart into simple categories of performance, and script, and intelligence--and yet all three of these succeed well beyond most other films, as the Coen brothers are perhaps the most inventive in the industry today. Because the funny aspect of the Hudsucker Proxy lies in a perfect amalgamation of every element of the film, it disappoints those people who are looking for &quot;one moment in time; so they can say right here, right now; this is it.&quot; With the Coens, this is impossible, since it is always about the sum of the parts rather than the integrity of a single aspect at a single moment.<br />But even beyond the humor of this film, I cannot help but praise it incessantly. Visually, as usual, it sets a stunning image, achieving a style that is entertaining in itself. The dialogue, whether you consider it funny or not, can be deemed nothing but intelligent and witty. The performances are dead-on and borderline eccentric/absurd, for what the Coen brothers are famous. The direction is always superb--and proof positive that even the direction plays a major role in the &quot;jokes&quot; of the Hudsucker Proxy, watch the camera during the Lounge Singers performance; the single greatest shot in the film has no dialogue and not even one of the main characters, and yet it punctuates the intended frivolity of the entire picture.<br />Some have commented that the viewer has little affection for the characters. To everyone their own, but MY own is that I TOO heartily fall in love with these characters. Tim Robbins is the clumsy everyman that any humbled human will see in himself; Jennifer Jason Leigh is our ambition, and tragic despite the darker side of her story. I'd go even so far as to say I like Paul Newman's character, whom despite the evil way in which he is portrayed, models our lowest and greediest selves. And so, while many contest the characters to be too inconsequential, I say they are the driving force, relating the viewer to himself in new and impossible ways amidst a superbly entertaining script. Again, some call the script pointless, but truth be told, I find this plot to be more well developed than most of the Coen brothers' other works.<br />And through all of these traits, Hudsucker takes the cake as my favorite comedy of all time. There is just something incredibly inventive, humorous, and intelligent in every single shot, every single word, every single expression and mannerism that the talented cast, crew, and filmmakers have put on the screen. There is a gift in everything to be witnessed, as every individual part is perfect--and perfectly implemented, since the final product far exceeds the sum of its parts. In short, from the minutest detail to the overall scheme, everything about this film pleases in new and unexpected ways that intend to spoof--and appear to--but really reinvent what it means to make a comedy. Take care to pay close attention to what this film offers, as I hope others take note and observe the magic it possesses; The Future is Now!
6301095294|5.0|Ever sence I was young I have herd that this was a BAD film. Last summer I rented it from a video store----and I liked it! This 'IS' the best Beatle film! I wouldent exactly say &quot;think of it as a smarty art film&quot;. But.....<br />I just loved the color tints douring shots of firlds and what not--the odd restraunt scene (with John as a waiter!)--the singing of &quot;TOOT-TOOT-TOOTSIE&quot; with all of the passengers--the ending &quot;finaly&quot; scene--the apperence of the Bozo dog do da band -the music video type sequences-and alot of other things!<br />just get it--you wont be disapointed-if you keep an open mind.<BR>thares no plot---its a documentary(of sorts)--its just fun
6305531374|3.0|michael's back in this latest installment.  i found this dvd to be very close to the first halloween. very good acting and storyline. my only complaint with this movie is the fact that it completly leaves out the story of halloween 4 - 5 &amp; 6.  it picks up after part 2 and makes no metion of the rest of the halloween movies!!! part 8 will no doubt do the very same thing which is due out in march 2002. the truth is this series died after<BR>part 5. buy this one only if you are a die-hard halloween fan!!!
B000003N89|5.0|All For You is the best representative of Diana's gift for jazz and swing music at its best, whether bouncy or intimate. You may think you're listening to a live recording. Even Boulevard of Broken Dreams or You're Looking at Me remain sophisticated without the addition of strings. Played just as the Nat Cole Trio might have down at Smokey Joe's.<br />For someone raised on the pop and rock sounds that came out of the 60's hearing a trio play mostly without percussion was a revelation. When I clicked the local FM station back on after several hours with All For You as music while I worked, the incessant snare of the rock beat pounded in my head like waking up to a jack-hammer on the street below. I have _not_ been listening to jazz for decades. That's the point. I learned a lot about Nat Cole's early career that was unkown to me from the CD notes. If I hand't been able to listen to samples of this album, I would have considered it last because of the Nat Cole connection. I am in debt to Diana Krall for bringing to my attention music I would have never listened to without experiencing her love for it. <br />I am in agreement with the other reviewers here that this is a great CD to unwind to, with its spare arrangements and quiet presence, not sleepy or mushy with strings. I love the playful Frim Fram Sauce, which Diana makes her own on this performance. Errand Girl for Rhythm is exactly what Diana becomes on this CD, supplying us with a steady telegraphing of her gifted jazz piano. You're Looking at Me is delivered with knowing sophistication the lyric deserves. I enjoy the simpler arrangements and intuitive playing of All For You more than any of her later CD's containing lush string arrangements that just sound studied and distant to me. The guitar work of Russell Malone is very tasteful, blending well with Diana's piano.<br />This CD has a very intimate and immediate sound. The recoding mikes each player very close, making for the intimate sound of this performance. You feel as if you're right in the middle of Krall, Malone and Keller as they play. Each instrument (including her voice) can be heard distinctly. There is no &quot;wall of sound&quot; or distant miking and mushy strings to come between you and the artist.<br />The production on Diana's early efforts, such as her first CD and Love Scenes, is uneven and less polished in comparison to the effort lavished on All For You. That is partly why I chose this as the first Diana Krall CD I bought. Unlike the other CD's the mike level and quality does not vary wildly from song to song, which I find annoying.<br />If you have a strong liking for this recording you will probably have a strong dislike for Diana's later recordings made in lush string settings that place her and the band at a sonically distant location, as we are listening to the band at the back tables of a smoky nightclub in the '50s. The kind of stuff you'd expect to be playing on a penthouse hi-fi in an old movie. Diana does a solid job with the standards on When I Look in Your Eyes and continues the evolution on her new recording The Look of Love. But I can't help but think  marketing forces are behind this transformation to the kind of sentimental, mushy sound that Nat Cole was doing by the time of hits like The Christmas Song. I'd like to think it's just Diana's changing sensibility, but could the same process be at work? I say this because I think if you're put off by her latest effort, then by all means try one of her earlier recordings.
6305546789|5.0|with out a doubt this is the best horror movie ever made!!<br /> the story is scary as hell.  the music is spookie and the acting is great!! if you never buy another dvd...do yourself a favor and buy this one!! you won't regret it.
B00005LOLD|5.0|Scenery is beautifully filmed as are many of the most famous tourist sites in Japan.  Ricardo Montalban was never nominated for his performance and it is outstanding as he takes on the intracacies of an actor in a different culture.  The Kabuki scenes are not entirely accurate but Montalban's performances capture the essence of this ancient Japanese theater.
0345448898|5.0|I found this trilogy enthralling with too many good points to name. I have to disagree that youths won't understand the book, as I am myself only 17. I also find books where a few of the main characters more interesting than those where all of the main characters 'live happily ever after'. I personally found the ending very emotional, this is the only book I have ever cried over, and I wish that there were going to be more books after 'The Amber Spyglass'.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone as it is without a doubt infinitely more pleasurable, in my opinion, to reading the 'Harry Potter' series, which although they are good, do not measure up to 'His Dark Materials'. So I would say BUY IT.

B00003CWL6|5.0|I simply fail to understand how people can slate this movie. To me, any rating that is less than four is a total injustice, and, for want of a better word - wrong.<br />For this is a beautiful film. And a masterpiece of filmmaking. Mendes takes some of the strongest, and in many ways disturbing scenes in the film, such as Thora Birch's character removing her top for her boyfriend, across the street, then clashes it with shocking and sudden violence, from the boyfriends father. It shocks - it brings you back to sick reality. And yet, Mendes never pauses on the individual emotions for too long - it never becomes unbearable. In a film with so many socially awkward moments, it would be easy for it to be cringeworthy, but it is executed so perfectly that the impact is delivered sans the guilt. This in itself is genious work from Mendes.<br />The story boldy cracks along, developed in a slightly Pulp Fiction-esque way (inter-twining plots). The music is divine, and implemented brilliantly. The message is delivered in a suitably oblique way, so that the viewer needs to think about it, but also gets a direct message fed to him. It works in all the right areas. You watch in a state of overwhelming consciousness, of yourself, and of your life. For me, it's as close to life changing as a movie is ever going to come.<br />I feel I must address the various poundings the film has received here, though. It is saddening that nudity is used as an excuse to give the film a bad rating, seeming to suggest that female nudity is either wrong or bad. I didnt see one complaint about male nudity, maybe that's due to the vagaries of reviewer demographics, but it seems that some moral attribute is amiss here (one of the very issues the film tries to tackle). Suvari is seen topless because she is being undressed. In real life, there would be no convenient blanket to cover her up in such a situation. And get over yourself, it's a minor feature of the movie. 'Curse words' (which obviously affect the story SO much) are also a poor reason to criticise a movie. Also, as a person who dislikes cursing anyway, this movie didnt shock or annoy me in that respect.<br />It seemed real, maybe too real. And maybe that's what people need to get over, the fact that the movie is highly real, and real in a way that can shock and impress. There's a message here that is so deep, it belongs more in the books of Plato or Socrates.<br />So, I beg you, watch it. Be entertained, laugh, cry - be moved.story SO much) are also a poor reason to criticise a movie.

B00005QIPH|5.0|This is definitely one of the best new albums that i've heard over the past few years.  The album just flies by, you can't believe that the 30+ min. have gone by when it's over, and your ready to start it again.  Music is so subjective, but i can def. say that &quot;Last Nite&quot;, the single from the album, is a good indicator of the album as a whole - if you got that song stuck in your head and are now thinking about buying the album(which is what happened to me) - then DEFINITELY buy it.  My favorite tracks on the album so far are &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;SOMA&quot;, &quot;is this it&quot;, &quot;barely legal&quot;, and, of course, &quot;Last Nite&quot;.  This album basically rocks; so different from what you hear on the radio today (closest thing is weezer i guess, but you really can't categorize this band), showing a great deal of influence from older punk stuff, but clearly something new.  For once, then, something, this is IT!!
B00004W592|5.0|The first Colosseum album I got was Daughter of Time, and I was less than pleased with that one. So I was so turned off by the band that I never bought anything from them for over five years. But once I got a hold of Valentyne Suite, released in 1969, regarded by many to be their best one, I was so amazed that this album deserves the five stars. Listening to this album, it's really hard to believe that this band actually stemmed from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, you can tell these guys set their ambitions really high here. Colosseum is unlike a lot of prog rock bands of the time, since here they tend to the blues and jazz spectrum. The album starts off with &quot;The Kettle&quot; which is actually surprisingly a heavy prog rock cut. Next, &quot;Elegy&quot; is a totally amazing cut demonstrating the band's jazzy side. &quot;Butty's Blues&quot; is, as the song title suggests, a bluesy number, but the jazz here comes from Chicago or Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears-like horns. &quot;The Machine Demands A Sacrifice&quot; starts off somewhat similar to &quot;The Kettle&quot; but then it really goes off the deep end with the percussion and psychedelic electronic effects. And of course the title track which demonstrates the band's talents in a three movement suite. That last movement, &quot;The Grass is Always Greener&quot; is nothing short of a stroke of genius. The music just keeps building up intensity to points that I am in total disbelief. When Jon Hiseman is regarded as one of the finest drummers in the jazz rock world, this album really proves that. Saxist Dick Heckstall-Smith, just like Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Van der Graaf Generator's David Jackson, and Osanna's Elio D'Anna, often had a habit of playing more than one sax at once, and you'll notice that one some of the cuts on the album. This was unfortunately the last album to feature James Litherland and Tony Reeves. When they left, ex-Bakerloo and future Humble Pie guitarist Dave &quot;Clem&quot; Clempson, bassist Mark Clarke, and vocalist Chris Farlowe stepped, and recorded the less than remarkable (at least to me) Daughter of Time.This here goes for the vinyl collectors:Colosseum's first two albums were seriously butchered when released in the United States on the ABC/Dunhill label. The US version of the debut, Those About to Die Salute You (which features a totally different cover than the UK version on Fontana) actually features some material on Valentyne Suite, as well as material from the UK album. The second album was called The Grass Is Greener (exact same cover as Valentyne Suite, except for the printed title) in the US which not only features the remaining material from Valentyne Suite (but partly re-recorded with new member Dave &quot;Clem&quot; Clempson), but material not released on any of their UK albums (such as &quot;Lost Angeles&quot;). Also of note, the original UK Valentyne Suite LP is a historic album for it marked the first album to ever be released on the Vertigo label. But the album I am reviewing is indeed the CD reissue of Valentyne Suite released on Castle (that wrongly gives a 1972 date, which was the year this album was reissued on Bronze, the label Colosseum moved to after Daughter of Time).So in conclusion, if you love your prog rock on the jazzy and bluesy side, you are sure to love this album.

B00005JKOV|5.0|Maybe the greatest thing you can find in a film sometimes, is the need to simply see and explore it again.  WAKING LIFE is one of those films that will take a long time to grow old, although for much of the present megaplex audiences, it also may take long time to grow on them.  This is not a traditional narritive film, and it shouldn't be.  It is a simple journey of walking through one man's dreams, and exploring those dreams with a passion and fire for life that few films lately have possessed.  Director Richard Linklater has made an astounding ode to exploration, both in the technical sense (the unbelievably breathtaking animation and digital camerawork), and the fluid movement of a non-narritive story filled to the brim with interstingly old and new ideas.  There is never a moment when the viewer will not be bombarded with amazing visuals, thought provoking ideas, and an all around feel for life and living.  True, there is no real action in this story, and at times it merely drifts from one conversation to the next with no inbetween.  It certainly does not possess John Fords A/B style of filmmaking.  The result, of course, is that this film is not going to match everyone's tastes.  However, for anyone ready to remember or discover that our life and dreams are wonderful and art in and of themselves, this film is more than perfect.  For eveyone else, it may not be the best film you'll ever see, but it's garunteed to make you think and put you in awe of the animation.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When I saw the first part of the show,my eyes sticked to the screen as it was very enthralling.I especially liked the talking donkey which could flatter people as he makes me laugh.<BR> This show is about an ogre who despises anyone to come and live with him as he likes his own privacy.The talking donkey wants to stay with him as the king banishes any fairytale creatures in his kingdom.The King Faaquad sends all these creatures to the ogre's place.To get his swamp back,he has to save Princess Fiona from the dragon and marry her to King Faaquad so that he can have his swamp back.Shrek,the ogre willingly went to rescue the princess with the talking,annoying donkey.I especially like the part when the dragon was chasing the donkey.The donkey had no where to run so he had to use his mouth to flatter the dragon.The dragon was so touched by what the donkey said until the dragon fell in love with the donkey.That was the best part in the show.<BR> On the journey back to King Faaquard's kingdom,Shrek and Princess Fiona had fallen in love with each other.But when Shrek misunderstood something that Fiona said,he gave up hope to marry her.On the wedding day,the donkey told Shrek what actually happened.Will Shrek manage to get his beloved love back?
B000000W3G|5.0|...than Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. This box contains all the songs that made me buy Mellon Collie. So save yourself some trouble and just get this instead. Why? Because in addition to the essential songs (Zero, Tonight Tonight, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, 33, 1979) you get a whole bunch of songs that are way better than the other &quot;in-between&quot; or &quot;filler&quot; songs found on Mellon Collie. &quot;In the eyes of ruby&quot; and &quot;XYU&quot; are possible exceptions, but not enough to warrant the whole drawn out overdramatic mess that it can be. &quot;Aeroplane&quot; gives you just enough drama without going too far over the top or forcing you to endure too much of Corgan's nasal voice trying to do what it shouldn't try to do (Muzzle: &quot;AAAAAHHHHHHIIIIIYY pheel that AHI am ooordinAHry..&quot;). Corgan does it just right on a lot of the tracks off the &quot;Tonight Tonight&quot; single. This single in itself might warrant the whole set but there is so much more to be found on every single contained in this set! This really is SP Heaven, and shows them in fine form. Get this and Siamese Dream and you've got all you need from Pumpkinland.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Putting an historical event of huge proportion like Pearl Harbor into the hands of producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay is kind of like asking the folks who created Looney Tunes to produce a documentary on the Nuremberg trials.<br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; emerges as a big, noisy, special effects laden cartoon with its centerpeice not really being December 7, 1941, but a cliche ridden love triangle between the movie's three stars(but then how else do you get the 12-17 year olds into a theater these days?).<br />The producers and writers of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; have taken the event that launched America into the second World War, added an &quot;Armageddon&quot;-like plot formula, some cardboard characters and have come up with a video-game simulation that falls just this short of trivializing history--Heaven help us if in sometime in the hopefully very distant future, this team gets its hands on 9.11.01<br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; has its moments, though.<br />The recreation of the attack itself is nothing short of magnificent and Jon Voight's FDR is a pleasaure to watch.<BR>**************************************<BR>&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; comes in a two disc package that incudes a &quot;making of&quot; documentary and a featurette about the real heroes of December 7, 1941.<br />Video and sound quality are excellent.
0471381985|4.0|This book was a worthwhile and quick read.  The author did a better job than other authors in relating the value approach to the theory of the firm, probability analysis, and behavioral finance -- and he did it in a non-technical way.

B00005214X|5.0|With the exception of the 2000 remake of \\"My Sweet Lord\\" (horrible, pointless and wrong), I can't say one bad thing about the music on this album. It is pure genius from beginning to end.<br />However... for some odd reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to ruin the original track order for the reissue. Not only are the bonus tracks inexplicably inserted in the middle, but record 3's track order is altered (it originally went like this: Out Of The Blue / It's Johnny's Birthday / Plug Me In / I Remember Jeep / Thanks For The Pepperoni). They should have put records 1 and 2 (the songs) on disc 1, followed by record 3 (the \\"Apple Jams\\"), and then the bonus tracks, on disc 2. Oh well. Thank God for cd burners, right?<br />The new cover looks like bad technicolor. Colorization didn't work for old movies owned by Ted Turner, and it sure as heck doesn't work here either. Really, someone fell asleep at the controls on that one. Also, the picture that appeared as a fold-out poster in the original LP configuration is reduced to a one inch wide reproduction on page one of the liner notes. WHY? This is such a great picture. In poster form, it is practically 3-dimensional. They could have at least let it fill up a full page... .<br />I rate this five stars only because the music, as previously stated, is pure genius; and can't be ruined by bad packaging. Thing is, after spending 20+ dollars on a 2CD set, I shouldn't also need a cd burner ($), Adobe Photoshop ($), and a color printer ($), just to get a reproduction that is of comparable quality to the 3LP set that I might have purchased in 1970.

B00005NW02|5.0|Toxicity is the best cd. it has a mix of heavy meatal and alternate rock. The best songs are Chop suey!, deer dance, toxicity, Forest, physco, needles and prison song.

B00003CXTF|5.0|Pearl Harbor has an excellent cast, and did a wonderful job of grasping both the emotion and action of war, making it one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.  The way that the beginning was so happy between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale really showed the devestation of war when Josh Hartnett is hurt in the end. I also liked the details, like the dog, and the other nurses, they made the plot and the story seem so realistic (and it definately should be). The end was so sad, Ben A. is so devestated... I actaully found tears in my eyes, and that is very uncommon because I have never cried at all during a movie, not even Titanic... major accomplishment! This is the kind of movie that you just want to watch over again because it captures human life and tragety and the facts all in one. I also loved the way they showed the romance between Josh H, and Kate B., it was so romantic and beautiful that it made the end devestating even to the viewer... very powerful. The cast and crew did a great job of portraying the battle in the eyes of young, american men who want to make a difference.

B000002UUH|5.0|This CD has all of John's best post-Beatles stuff on it. Dispite the fact that he produced music for a decade (taking about 4 years off) after the demise of the Fab Four and his Untimely Demise, the sad truth is that his best work fits on a single CD. Don't waste your time and money on any of the regular albums (except, perhapse Imagine, and Plastic Ono Band) because you get all (or almost all) of the good stuff here.
B000002JS0|5.0|I would rank High Voltage as one of the early 70's greatest albums. It's also one of AC DC's greatest albums, second only to Live in my opinion. All the songs on this album are exatly what you'd expect, High Woltage Rock'n Roll. From the classic TNT, to the all out nasty She's Got Balls, High Voltage is an electrified frenzee of Rock that will have you banging your head, playing air guitar and drums, and screamming the song lyrics, trying your best to sound like Bon Scott!

0679601686|5.0|i loved this book the moment i started reading it. each and every event in it beacame my very own; Jane austen  definitely knows how to weave her stories into the hearts of the readers. elizabeth bennet, the heroine, is a vivacious spirited young woman who speaks from her mind and learns from her heart. mr. darcy is uniquely unfolded as a man of principles and convictions. he starts to make you think of what you truly stand for. this  is a story full of warmth, tenderness and love from the heart. you'll enjoy every moment of this scintillating experience.
6305609705|5.0|... unless you were going all the way.  APOCALYPSE NOW is a brilliant movie, and it is brilliant on many levels.  It is filled with single sentences that succinctly and accurately sum up America's fears and frustrations with the Vietnam War.  Sentences like:  \\"I love the smell of Napalm in the morning ... Smells like victory.\\" and \\"Charlie don't surf.\\" are so memorable, and so metaphorically powerful, that they will remain with you for a lifetime.  Based on Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, APOCALYPSE NOW uses exceptional cinematography, music, plot, and acting to convey the ambience and ideas of Conrad's novel.<br />Technically, this movie is outstanding.  I watched it on a 1600 x 1200 pixel, 32-bit color display, and every scene was perfect.  Its music, by THE DOORS, fits precisely with this movie's goals.<br />In its special features section, director Francis Ford Coppola said: \\"The most important thing I wanted to do in the making of APOCALYSE NOW was to create a film experience that would give the audience a sense of the horror, the madness, the sensuousness, and the moral dilemma of the Vietnam war.\\"  You succeeded Francis; you succeeded brilliantly.
B000006NUW|5.0|Five words? Go out and get it!.......If you're a TRUE music lover of heart, rythmn, and soul...it's in this box!!..Motown is infinite in being the progenitor of the sounds that travel through popping  finger tips, patting feet, and swaying hips. These songs make you croon and swoon, they hold decades of memories of softer, gentler times and also of turbulent and trying times. But no matter the situation one could find one's own salve within these songs. With the world the way it is today, just listening to this set will reinforce the message that ''through it all, we can claim a melody and keep our beat''. Smokey, The Tempts, and all the others are not only classic, but artists with timeless musical class. They brought a generation a hope, a joyfulness, a spirit of achievement. These things should be in every generation. This is one way to make that happen. These artists, these songs are SIMPLY THE BEST!!!
0792844890|4.0|\\"Spaceballs\\" is a great example of a cheaply-priced DVD, with few special features, that's a must-have for your collection.  The movie isn't the best parody film that came out of the 1980s -- obviously it's hard to stack up against \\"Airplane!\\" or \\"The Naked Gun\\" -- but it's got a terrific joke-per-minute ratio and an unusually deep cast.<br />Bill Pullman and Daphne Zuniga are still recognizable names 15 years later.  You have a cameo by John Hurt, a walk-on for Tim Russ (who deserved a medal for his long-suffering 7 years on \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\"), and Brooks himself in *two* roles.  Then there's Dom DeLuise's voiceover, and John Candy and Rick Moranis (quintessential '80s funny-men) both on top of their games and stealing every scene they're in.  And if you saw \\"Spaceballs\\" you also saw at least three of the \\"Police Academy\\" epics -- and there's Michael Winslow, the funny noises guy!  Even Homer Simpson remembers him.<br />What turns the (...) DVD into a true collector's item is Mel Brooks's commentary.  Who wouldn't want to have Mel Brooks sitting on the couch right next to them while watching the movie?  His track isn't as intense as the commentary for, say, \\"The Godfather\\"... but it doesn't need to be.  Mel comments on all the gags, laughing or groaning when appropriate, and seems to have the CV of every cast and crewmember in front of him, because he can tell you how he found the third extra from the left in any given scene.  This was all recorded years ago, in the laserdisc era -- perhaps the track might be deeper today -- but at the end of the day you still have Mel Brooks talking you through the movie.  If you don't appreciate that, you're watching the wrong director.

B000021YQV|2.0|I love soad and I was really looking forward to the followup. I heard chop suey on the radio and I got it the same week it came out. While the songs are very well written, it lacks the flow and the energy from the first album. Perhaps I had listened to the debut a bit too much, but I felt they took a little too much time with this one.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Before Blind Guardian put out NiME, they were a great German speed/power metal band.  But since then, they elevated themselves into a class of their own.  Anymore, it is just as foolish to pass BG off as another speed metal band as it is to pass Queen off as only being another 70s glam band.  If you don't believe me just check out NiME.  Here are several reasons why:<br />1.  Great use of instruments - Along with already being a splendid metal band, BG also used flutes, keyboards, and strange acoustic guitar tunings to create a flawless fusion with folk, classical, and medieval musical styles.  It may sound cliched, but it has to be heard to be believed.  While NiME may not be as heavy or as fast as their previous albums, it shows true maturity and broadening of ideas.<br />2.  Vocals - Very rarely do you hear of a metal band that puts just as much effort into their vocal arrangements as they do their instrumental - not that they slouched in that department.  Yet somehow, BG pull it off beautifully.<br />3.  The Tolkein issue - I've read entirely too many reviews full of hoo-ha saying, &quot;Tolkein's rolling in his grave.&quot;  He probably is considering this album lingers in relative obscurity while people like Fred Durst, Lou Pearlman, and Sean Combs are thoroughly annihilating the public's perception of music.  But back to the point at hand.  Even if you haven't read anything Tolkein has written but still listened to NiME, it should become obvious the BG meant only respect for Tolkein.<br />4.  The album just plain rocks.  Great guitar playing and a drummer that makes you ask yourself, &quot;Lars who?&quot;<br />Overall rating: don't wait for one, just run out and buy the darn thing NOW!!!
B00000255F|5.0|I truely believe this is the single greatest album of rock and roll.  It defines rock and roll with &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Thunder Road&quot;  But all of the tracks are great &quot;Backstreets&quot; &quot;Night&quot; &quot;Jungleland&quot;.  Anyone who calls themselve a Boss fan and doesn't own this album should purchase this album soon.  I have been listening to Bruce since I was a kid, my dad loved his music and used to play &quot;Born in the USA&quot; all the time.  I liked it, but it wasn't until I bought &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Darkness on the Edge&quot; of Town that I truely started listening to love his music.  Both albums are great and are two of my personal favorites.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Looking for a family film in the best sense of the word? \\"SHREK\\", the most successful film of the year (so far pre \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\") brings to life a surrealistic, three dimensional world inhabited by all manner of extreme but believable characters with their own, very human, problems and agendas. Mike Meyers inspired voice work for the title ogre is dead on and implies much more humanity than the mere words he says.  Eddie Murphy is consistently in the zone as the up-beat, bluntly honest (...) Donkey (is that redundant?). Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow bring the princess and the vertically challenged,  king to life. But the most interesting thing that looms over this film about self acceptance is the personal war between Disney's Michael Eisner and DreamWorks' \\"Shrek\\" producer Jeffrey Katzenberg. The rivalry and bitterness between the two former Disney associates has resulted in several extraordinary animated products that are probably much better than they might have been. Let's hope they keep competing on a personal level because \\"Shrek\\" is just about perfect.<br />Except for one thing. And that's the politically correct ending. It would've made anotgher hudnred million if the two ogres in love were transformed into perfect and beautiful and forever young beings.  Isn't that the whole point of life and why fairy tales go for the final ultimate metaphor?

Both versions of the film and numerous extras fill two discs. A bonus CD of \\"Stillwater\\" in concert is part of the package. But the star of this version is the weirdly nostalgic and sentimentally unsettling conversation between Cameron and his mommy on the commentary track. ...
B00003CXTG|4.0|I LOVED this movie!  (...)If you want a movie that will make you cry and give you a little taste of history then this is the movie that you want to see. If you are expecting a totally actuate account of Pearl Harbor then you are going to be disappointed. But when you watch this try to remember that there has NEVER been a truly accurate Hollywood film that told history like it really happened, so just sit back and enjoy a movie that has a touching story of love and friendship.  Oh, and Josh Hartnett is HOT!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Just think, how many new special effects were available for the new sequel Episode I, thou Episode IV “A New Hope” with all those old fashioned effects is still ranked within the top ten movies of all times, at least for me, the best movie ever.<br /> The touch of simplicity (R2D2 &amp; C3PO lost in the desert and their encounter with the Jawas), rustic elements (the most popular starship, “Millenium Falcon” was “a piece of junk” as described by young Skywalker and also the scenes at Mos Aisly resembling the old wild west) and the interaction of characters with opposite lifestyles (ancient mysticism inspired by the figure Obi Wan as opposed to the agnosticism of the outlaw Han Solo) makes up the difference between a movie with special effects (Episode IV) and a movie of special effects (Episode I).

B00000JPH6|4.0|I never even saw THE DARK CRYSTAL before getting the DVD as a present. When I finally got around to viewing it a few months later, I was stunned and amazed:  Jim Henson and Frank Oz didn't simply make a full-length movie starring Muppets; no, they created a whole new world in much the same way George did did with STAR WARS. Instead of sci-fi, this movie is classic fantasy, with old/wise men, innocent young hero/heroine, and reptilian-like villian characters abounding in a world that can only be described as unique and spectacular. It takes you back to a time in your youth where all you needed was a fantasy tale like this to take you away and make you dream of things greater (and more interesting) than the day-to-day existence of real life. This film captures those youthful yearnings perfectly.<br />Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the famous Muppet team of Henson and Oz could create a whole new WORLD with their art.  They suceeded marvelously at bringing us the story of the wise, peace-loving Mystics and their quest to restore balance to the world ruled by the ugly, cynical, reptilian Skeksis. The Mystics' only hope is in the orphaned Gelfling boy Jen, who is sent out to recover the final shard of the Dark Crystal, which will restore peace and balance to the world.  That is the entire plot of this film, and it is all the plot it needs, because its purpose is to have us follow the boy along on his adventures, and share in what he experiences.  Of course, it is also about style, and THE DARK CRYSTAL has plenty of that.<br />I absolutely recommend purchasing this DVD for anyone ages 8 and up. Jim Henson was a genius, and so is Frank Oz. (Jim Henson produced this film, and both he and Oz co-directed it.) THE DARK CRYSTAL was made way back in 1984, and it still continues to mesmerize people today!

It was after I bought this I knew that Only Time is her current chart hit. To me listening to this album is like reading a novel say, Jane Austin's Sense and Sensitivity, Thomas Hardyfs Tess of DfUbervilles or Harry Potter series. My #1 favorite is One by One the most well-written song. It didn't take long to become one of my all time favorites. Music fans irrespective of his/her favorite genre will love this album for sure.

This cd in my opinion was better than their last one but I loved their last one also.  These guys may get criticized about their lyrics being mindless but you have to actually listen to the song to figure it out.  SoaD has a great and promising future.  Oh, and by the way if you like slipknot, mudvayne, linkn park, spineshank, or powerman 5000, this cd should be #1 on your list.

B00005B36H|4.0|Seeing Tool play the last 40 seconds of Reflection for 6 minutes instantly made me a fan. Those chords are just...........<br />.... haunting.<br />They must release that live. It was insanely brilliant. The entire crowd was in a trance. All was silent but the guitar.<br />haunting.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I really thought this movie was a good movie for a Historical event that actually occurred. It seemed like a love-story also just like Titanic movie which kept the movie interesting to watch. For some of us who wasn't even born to see this event it would give a general idea and to be proud to be an American.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I enjoyed the combination of a wonderfully real depiction of the historic events that &quot;Changed the Face of History&quot;, and the emotional love story that is woven amist the events of the attack and the days leading up to it. It was one of those movies that my family will watch again and again.
0553260111|5.0|Ludlum wrote an exceptional thriller that serves as a page-turner by itself and an addictive drug that can only be satisfied by reading The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Supremacy, the two books that follow. Go ahead and buy all three at once, it will save you the trip to the bookstore when you finish &quot;Identity.&quot;
B0000296SI|5.0|This CD is Blink 182's best work yet!<BR>Although it wasn't as punk as Dude Ranch with great songs like \\"Dammit\\" and \\"Waggy\\", I think the album overall was slightly better. It's a great balace between the wild punk of Dude Ranch and the proffesional punk-pop of Take Off Your Pants & Jacket. <br />1.Dumpweed: 9/10 Punk-rock near its best.<br />2.Don't Leave Me: 8/10 A good song.<br />3.Aliens Exist: 8/10 I like the lyrics in this song.<br />4.Going Away To College: 10/10 What more can I say?.....<br />5.Whats My Age Again: 10/10 Excellent (everything about this song is perfect.<BR>6.Dysentary Garry: 7.5/10 A bit rough around the edges but still good.<BR>7. Adam's Song: 10/10 A very emotional song. It still sends  shivers up my spine.<BR>8.All The Small Things: 5/10 It sounds too much like pop for my liking, but I'll take it over Bardot anyday.<BR>9.The Party Song: 9.5/10 I would have given it a 10/10 if I could understand the lyrics more clearly.<BR>10.Mutt: 8/10 I like the verses, Mark's voice sounds great!<br />11.Wendy Clear: 10/10 My favourite song on the CD!!!<br />12.Anthem: 9.5/10 A kick-... song to finish off the album.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde is cute, perky, girly, and funny. Granted, it's a chick flick, but some guys enjoy it too.<br />Here's a plot breakdown: Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon), a fashion major in CA, gets dumped by her boyfriend when she had previously thought he would be proposing to her that night. He says he wants to stop fooling around if he ever wants to be a senator. He goes to Harvard law school. Elle, determined to impress him, follows him there. When she starts out, she hates it because all the people there think she's just another dumb blonde. Then she starts doing better, making some friends (including a divorced manicurist whom she helps to get her dog back), and she ends up with an important case. I won't give away any details about it, but it ends up being really funny.<br />Reese Witherspoon proves that not all blondes are dumb, and makes a funny, cute movie in the process.
0790736039|2.0|Well, I woudn't say this movie as a whole (...), but the dialogue is pretty weak, a lot of it doesn't make any sense and the acting is hoooooorrrriiibbbbllllle.  I mean it basically ruins the whole thing.  The charahcters are just plain not believable.  The best thig that can be said about it is that the pennywise segments are very scarry.  But thats about it.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Great CD.  Blues, alt rock, classic rock, R&amp;B, hip-hop, pop, and just a touch of jazz all in one.  Great lyrics.  A particularly good one is &quot;Misery&quot; with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler lending his always-cool raspy voice for backup vocals, and let's give a hand to Bon Jovi's Richie Sambora for the guitar solo.  &quot;Respect&quot; gives a great outlook on male-female interaction, and &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; is an instant hit.  It's definitely worth your money.
B000003NA4|4.0|..But not really Diana's top effort. I suggest WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES as Diana's supreme achievement so far.That is the one for all prospective Diana fans,mainly since it displays more styles,including such terrifically orchestrated ballads...Even so, LOVE SCENES is definitely a worthy companion. Perhaps WHEN I LOOK is so outstanding that anyone would have a tough time equalling it. Every piece here though is a winner too, even if the sets includes a few more familiar old standards.(WHEN I LOOK has more less known songs.) The rarely done &quot;Garden in the Rain&quot; is my favorite here, along with the better known &quot;How Deep is the Ocean?&quot;, and &quot;I Don't Stand A Ghost of a Chance&quot; .By the way,oddly &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot; is not played too much either these days,unusual perhaps since it was Sinatra's first big hit way back in 1939,and Diana's wispy, snappy version is fine too.
B00004XQ83|4.0|Please don't be deceived by the review above that claims this CD won't run on a computer. I almost did not buy the album because of the false warning. I AM RUNNING WINDOWS 98, and I CAN PLAY IT ON MY COMPUTER WITHOUT A SINGLE PROBLEM. In fact, the CD includes special features and a screen saver for computer use! Moreover, I was able to use MusicMatch Jukebox (available to download for free) to copy tracks from the CD onto my system.<br />As for the music, well, I loved the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou. I liked the song &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot; enough to prompt me to buy the entire CD. Overall, I am delighted with the tracks. I've let it play over and over again since picking it up, and I have yet to get bored with it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|...pop albums going back or forward in time. Let's face it,there is more to good songs and music than youth-oriented rock. I was in 8th grade when this album came out,and always liked it alot,and the funny thing is not until maybe 30 years later, did I ever meet anyone who liked it much . But I've always been a big BBoys fan. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is among the finest compositions ever, and, along with a handful of Brian's songs,deserves inclusion in the 20th Century canon, along with Gershwin's and Kern's best,etc. I heard a beautiful recording of this by a Canadian children's choir,which sounds better than the BBoys.Beyond this, most the tunes seem to be about late adolescent angst,high production value or not. As one gets into the Middle Years of life, can anyone really praise &quot;Wouldn't it be Nice&quot;, or &quot;Caroline No&quot; to the Sky? They remind me of whining choir boys,stretching to hit a note. Yes, Brian was looking for a new sound at the time,but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work. It's true they were still very young (mid- 20's probably) when they did PET SOUNDS..The songs with Mike singing the lead come off better, like &quot;I Know there's an Answer&quot;, &quot;Here Today&quot;, and &quot;I'm Waiting for the Day&quot;, with the high pitched Wilson brothers doing the backgrounds. Along with their own SURFS UP, this is among the great late 60's, early 70's  pop/rock albums. Yes, it's up there with the best of the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel,and the Byrds. But's let's not go overly gaga on it! Brian another Mozart or Handel?? Come on,let's not overdo a good thing!
B00005ALP6|4.0|A brilliant adaption to this Broadway musical. <BR>Audrey Hepburn (&quot;Breakfast at Tiffiny's&quot;, &quot;The Nun's Story&quot;) is perfect for the role of Eliza Dolittle. From her accent as a flower seller, all the way to the beauty of the grand ball, she plays this role as if it's who she is. Rex Harrison (Doctor Dolittle) plays Professor Higgins, as he did in the Broadway musical. He has become the only person we could ever see in this role, as well as the first person who comes to mind when thinking about this film. <BR>The only criticism I have for this film is concerning the music. Hepburn, while I beautiful actress, is a TERRIBLE singer. Knowing this fact, the director casted someone to sing all of Hepburn's songs for her. The lip-sinking is pretty bad on some of the songs, the most noticable being on the song 'I Could Have Danced All Night' where Hepburn is not ever CLOSE to being in sink with the song. On the song 'Wouldn't It Be Lovely', the singer's voice comes out with a slightly different accent that Hepburn had. These are very slight flaws; you would only notice them if you were looking for them. All in all, this is a beautifully made movie, deserving all the awards that were given to the show.
B000002L9J|5.0|While it is true that the Smiths were primarily a singles band, &quot;The Queeen is Dead&quot; is a rare example of an album almost completetly perfected. When one looks backs the 80s there simply isn't another album as cohesive as this one.<br />The chemistry between Morrissey and Marr was at its' zenith during the recording of this album. Their songwriting collaborations were the most poignant of their career; songs like 'There is a Light That Never Goes Out,' 'Bigmouth Strikes Again' and 'The Boy with a Thorn in His Side' are among the most well written songs of the entire decade.<br />This album, however, is not flawless. 'Frankly Mr. Shankly' and 'Some Girls' are not mere drivel, but at the same time they do not live up to the standard achieved by the other eight tracks on the album.<br />That all being said, this is a brilliant album with some great melodies and very witty lyrics. Above all though, one can't really appreciate the face of modern British music without hearing this album...several times....
B00005QIPH|1.0|The Strokes &quot;Is This It&quot; is vastly overrated. They are entirely derivative, but offer nothing even slightly new or interesting. To compare them to the Velvet Underground is an insult to that great band. The Strokes lack the kind of gritty edge and fantastic musicianship that defined the V.U., not to mention range of songwriting (the V.U. could also write beautifully melodic songs like &quot;I'll Be Your Mirror,&quot; &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; etc.) &quot;Is This It&quot; is really monotonous.
0684833395|4.0|A completely new type of humor, not &quot;ha ha&quot; funny (but can be!) but &quot;a smile&quot; funny. Catch 22 is more of a collection than a story. The funny bits do build on each other to help the reader establish the character's personality's, but the chapters are almost modular. My favorite character was Major Major. I'd reccommend this book to just about anyone, except for the insanely serious reader.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham deals with a subject my own family brings up from time to time - the commercialism of Christmas and why don't we just skip it. Of course, we never do.  However, it was great living it vicariously through another family!  Mr. Grisham has a great sense of humor and lets it shine through with this one.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is the best Cd that I own! I have many great CDs but this one is by far the best. All of the tunes are so catchy and are once you listen once you want to keep on listening.
0064407667|5.0|Even though I've only read the book one time, but it is my all time favorite. Violet, Klaus and Sunny are very unlucky kids. Their parents die when their mansion is burned down. It happens when they are at Briny Beach. Mr. Poe comes and tells them the sad news. Then they live with him, his wife and two chilren. Then Mr. Poe makes arrangements for them to live with a distant relative on the other side of town. His name is Count Olaf. Count Olaf is a strange man that lives in a shabby house. His next-door neighbor Justice Starus has a beautiful home though. Count Olaf is a tall wart faced man  that hardly ever home. He has a eyeball tatoo on his ankle. He gives the children 1 bed to sleep in. So Violet and Klaus take turns sleeping in it. They make Sunny a bed out of curtains.<BR> I'm sorry if I gave a lot of the story awaay but it is so exciting. Read it! It is a great book.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album is U2's supreme achievement. Bono's lyrics are better here than on any other U2 album by far. Songs like 'So Cruel' and 'Love is Blindness' effectively paint pictures that are universal to the human experience: loss, alienation, and heartbreak.<br />The musicianship here is top-notch as well. One of the things that has always turned me on about the band is the rhythm section with Clayton on bass and Mullen on drums. On no other album is the chemistry between the two finer. 'Acrobat' and 'Light my Way' are two such songs where the rhythm section simply rocks.<br />In retrospect, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is the most experimental and original thing that U2 have done. It's less commercial than &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; but it had no shortage of hits either. 'One' and 'Even Better Than the Real Thing' are the most accessible tracks on the album, but like all great albums &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; gets better with every listen and the songs function best when listened to together and uninterrupted.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I don't like to make critical comments concerning music.I cannot say anything positive about this release.<br /><br />I am familiar with the producers (Tommy LiPuma and Al Schmitt), whom collaborated on many fine late 70's and 80's Jazz releases for Warner Bros. [[ASIN:B000002KHU Breezin]]. And Claus Ogerman [[ASIN:B000008BWX Claus Ogerman Featuring Michael Brecker]] is thrown into this swill-mix to conduct the orchestration.<br /><br />Marilyn Scott sang a rendition of &#34;The Look of Love&#34; [[ASIN:B0000062VK Avenues of Love]] which is the benchmark for today's torch singers. Buy her release. It is far superior for all of the contained songs.<br /><br />This release is uninspired. Do you like carbonated soda without the fizz? Powdered milk at room temperature? Well, you're in luck--this release is for you!<br /><br />Ms. Krall sang a rendition of &#34;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&#34; on this album [[ASIN:B000003N89 All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio]] March 12, 1996 (see my Listmania Lists here on Amazon for my terse review), that is unequivocally; simply and absolutely incredible. Antithetical to this release--no worthy person could honestly adjudge comparison to this vocalization. This release is made to sell the cover rather than the music: And this is a profound shame indicative of the malaise within our culture.
0393312836|4.0|(...) This book is not just a blob of violence and rape, it is a fascinating narrative into the lives of a teenage gang who find pleasure in the illicit acts of rape and murder. I recommend this book to anyone who can stand the graphic language of this novel. Check out the movie if you get the chance.
B00004SU5J|3.0|For those who are attracted to this dic from the deep soulful house of Boulevard or From Detroit to... beware, this is light loungy faux jazz. It's alright, but it is not serious deep house which I've credited St. Germain with in the past. So Flute is the stand out track.
B000002OZY|5.0|I have to admit. A few years back, I dismissed The Who as pompous and arrogant. But since my musical tastes have expanded (I listen to progressive rock and new age), I find The Who to be a great and astonishing band. Pete Townshend is a genius! The guy can write, sing and play well. Anyway, forgive me for all of that. Tommy is an excellent album. It's a concept album, which means everything on here flows like one large piece. It's about a deaf, dumb, mute and blind boy who goes through transformations. I'll leave it at that since it's been discussed in greater detail by many other reviewers. But beside that, this album has a wide range of mind-blowing music.<br />Highlights are :<br />Overture, which shows off the amazing guitar playing from Pete, it also shows the versatility of bassist John Entwistle. He played the french horn on here. 1921, shows what a great singer Pete Townshend is. Many people may disagree with me, but I prefer Pete Townshends vocals over Roger Daltrey's, even though Roger Daltrey is a powerhouse singer. It's just that Pete seems to have more of an earthy, pathos-soaked voice, that's hard to not fall for. Amazing Journey, is where Keith Moon's insane drumming gets the spotlight. Christmas, Cousin Kevin, the provocative Acid Queen, which is funny in a dark way. Fiddle About, the popular Pinball Wizard, the short, playful, elegant There's A Doctor. The power rocking Go To The Mirror, which features the first appearance of the &quot;see me, feel me/listening to you&quot; segue. Roger Daltrey's vocals shine here. Tommy Can You Hear Me, excellent short piece. The commercial jingle-like Miracle Cure, the rocking I'm Free. The quirkiness of Tommy's Holiday Camp, and the grand finale of We're Not Gonna Take It.<br />The Who has become a favorite of mine along with many others.<br />This is an album I would recommend to all music lovers.
0064407667|5.0|I've only read this book 1 time but it is my favorite book.  The Baudelaire children, Violet(14) Klaus ( a bit older then 12) and Sunny (2 and a half) were very unfortunate since their parents died when their house gort burned to a crisp. They had to live with Mr.Poe for a while since they had no where to live. They hated it there. Then they went to Count Olaf's( there distant cousin) house to live. Read the book ( or give it to someone) because I'm not telling you anything else. Very good for children around the age of 9. This a very good book. Suspence, action and some happy parts.
B00005Q4GA|5.0|This movie was one of the best Action flicks I have ever seen, and I've seen alot!  Jolee was almost too perfect as Croft, and even sexier in real life.  Her skimpy suit was...h-ho-ot.  (...) Anyway, see the movie...right now.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|My first impression was surprising - it is something quite different from his preceding album, but it is great as well. The best track for me is Hero - I think Enriques amazing voice is predestinated for this kind of songs - full of emotions and love!<BR>Then I very like Escape - the arrangement is very interesting, Dont Turn off the Lights and When the World Crashes Down. As a matter of fact, the only track is not my favorite - She Be the One - I think it is not a song for Enrique. I am very glad he does not forget singing in Spanish and I hope he will continue.<BR>Me gusta su msica mucho porque canta por el corazn.<BR>!Fantstico!
B00004SCX6|4.0|I think that a lot of people were ready to clamber all over this and tell us how terrible it was.  That is simply not the case.  Where Britney Spears revolutionised pop music with her hit single 'Baby...One More Time', this expands on her winning formula.  Unlike the last album, there's a lot less filler.  The singles are all funky and sexy enough to appeal to any fan of pop music.  Plus there's even a slice of reasonable intelligence with 'Lucky'.<br />I'm sure that there's plenty of devoted fans of the Stones who'll say she's destroyed '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'.  Well, whilst it's not the album's best point, it's still pretty good and it's nice to see an artist cover a song and not keep it exactly the same.  Congratulations to Britney for daring to cover and song and do it her way.  And essentially that's what the album's about - doing it her way.  Yes she may be the puppet of studio executives but there's no denying Britney's power and her message of self-assertation and not taking no for an answer are nothing if not punchy.  There are even some good ballads on here, something which her rivals haven't managed to achieve - 'Lucky' and 'Where Are You Now?'.<br />At the end of the day though, there'll be those that like this kind of music and those that don't.  Britney isn't though-provoking or meaningful, but then she's not supposed to be.  This is pure escapist fun, something you can dance to, something you can tap your toe to.  Essentially, this is pop at its best.
B000008H1W|5.0|Jethro Tull continues to pull out another great effort along with Aqualung, Thick As A Brick and A Passion Play. To be quite honest, at first listen, I dismissed this album as awful, but I took a look at the album artwork and I had a devastating hunch that I was going to totally love it, and so it happened.<br />Also worth noting: Jethro Tull pulled out almost metal-guitar playing on this album, which at times is reminiscent of Aqualung.<br />It starts off with the title track, which has a phenomenal acoustic/folk/renaissance beginning. Then it explodes into a heavy rocker for the next six minutes. Cold Wind To Valhalla, another rocker in the Jethro Tull tradition mixing those famous elements of folk/rock. Black Satin Dancer is arguably the strongest track on here, or to say the least, is my favorite. This song along with the title track remind me of Bohemian Rhapsody in the fact that they are all extended rockers with multi-like sections. They all also came out the same year.<br />Requiem is a beautiful sedated acoustic piece. One White Duck, is also an acoustic piece. Baker St. Muse is a 17 minute epic that ties all the previous elements together. It has pounding rock, soft acoustic guitar pieces topped off with orchestral flourishes. Also, check out Ian Anderson's reaction to his mistake on the first take of this song. It's quite hilarious.<br />And we all thought Ian Anderson was a refined gentleman...Well he is.<br />This one took a while to grow, mainly because on this album, most of the tracks are extended and they seem to have a richness and a complexity that may take time to get used to. But overall, it's Jethro Tull and is in no way a disappointment.
B00005QXDD|5.0|While not as funny as their now classic HBO special, which is still one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life, this is still the 'D' doing very 'D' like things in a very 'D' like way.  Most of what made the special funny was the visual stuff, like JB going insane in his underwear punching holes in dry-wall, or the karate street fight between JB and KG.  Without that over-the-top stuff to fall back on, the CD is forced to actually rock, and rock it does.<br />I think that's what was most surprising about the disk: it rocks.  Sure it's funny, I expected funny, I just didn't expect it to rock quite as hard as it does.  With a little help from lots of talented friends, the 'D' have more than a couple of songs you'll find yourself jamming out to.  I can honestly say I haven't bought a CD I've enjoyed this much in years.  It never leaves my car CD player.  My favorite tune, by far is &quot;City Hall&quot; an epic montage which plays like a cross between a misguided &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; a misguided U2, and a really dumb Beatles.  The closest the 'D' ever gets to a political statement is &quot;smoking up city hall&quot; and leading as two kings whose priorities are legalizing marijuana and traveling in tubes.  Of course, that seems like a good idea to me.<br />Anyway, after waiting for years for this CD, I am not disappointed.  I got more than one belly laugh out of the deal and it's still my current favorite CD.   If you've never heard of the 'D' and are wondering why you should bother dishing out your hard earned cash, I have two words for you: &quot;Cleveland Schemer.&quot;
B00005LOUS|5.0|You all know chirtsmas is soon so you SHOULD get the grinch!Funny and of course,green!I will tell you reviews and some stuff(stuff you don't know)bye for now:)
B00005QFHG|5.0|I must admitt i'm not into romantic movies most of the time i Don't care about it But THis Chocalat was Fantastic a lighthearterd movie witch you can sit back and enjoy what else could you expect with one of the most Adoreble and Charming Female actresses off all time Binoche, Olin and a great young talent wich i think Johnny Depp certainly is he sure has proving himself in the Crazy Tim burton movie and That marvellous true Maffia Story. Chocolat is a movie has it all a laugh a tear excitment and a good tasty feeling you can't get enough off it. This film could have an eternal playing it's like real chocalate when you eat the last piece you're still want another bite
B000056H77|5.0|I have been a Phil Collins fan since I was 12 years old, he is great, he is one of the best musicians of the world. His True Colours version is simple wonderful. I know that you will keep this album in your heart and mind, He is simply the Best!
B00005QCYD|3.0|I had fun watching this film, it was nothing more than a fast paced fun action film. Sam Neil makes a welcome return as Dr Grant. This film was shot so close up that the dinosors don't seem real so i don't care som much about seeing everything, most of the shots are just full scrren reacting.
B000009QPE|5.0|15 years ago this CD was released on American recordings.  It was the first to feature Rick Rubin producing a metal album.  Could he screw things up for the already budding Slayer?<br />The answer is a thousand times no, as to this day, this is the best sounding metal album I've heard.  The power of the guitars are just monstrous, the bass is audible, Araya's vocal range is captured perfectly and Lombardo's kit work is unreal.<br />This is without a doubt the best metal CD I own.  It's brevity works to its advantage as I can listen to the thing 3 times in a row and not get bored once.  Slayer's masterpiece is right here as they have not touched anything like this since it's release.  <BR>&quot;Angel of Death&quot;, the intro, is THE thrash metal song of the genre.  &quot;Piece By Piece&quot; and &quot;Necrophobic&quot; are both short, killer songs set at 110% thrash pace.  You will feel winded after those two are done.  The dualing &quot;Altar of Sacrifice&quot; and &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; are highlights as well featuring some of the best riffs ever recorded by the band.  The stacking feature in &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; is especially memorable and definitely showcases the power that Rick Rubin put into this.  &quot;Criminally Insane&quot;, &quot;Reborn&quot; and &quot;Epidemic&quot; are all incredible thrash songs as well.  Check out Lombardo's work at the beginning of &quot;Epidemic&quot; if you really want to see how drumming should be done.  And then we reach the quintessential album closers in &quot;Postmortem/Raining Blood&quot;.  Talk about riffs, both these songs show King and Hanneman at their musical apex.  The huge boom of rain clouds end this album on a high note.<br />Honestly, nothing has topped this since it's release.  Slayer created something special here and if you've been missing out, I feel the urge to knock some sense into you.  Get this CD, there's nothing else like it out there.<br />Slayer is life.
B00003CXQX|5.0|I own it and it is really funny!Sometimes,when i see a llama,i automaticly name it kuzco and try to talk to it:)Also,the other charecters were cool too but i just say this:Boom,baby!
B00005OB0A|5.0|This is the album all the Kylie fans worldwide knew she was capable of doing and the wait is over!!!!  <br />Kylie is the best kept secret from North America, but for how much longer??  Already she's turning heads in Canada (again...after a 12 year absence) &amp; it won't be long before the same thing happens stateside.  People will no longer be saying &quot;Oh Kylie, that Locomotion girl&quot;!<br />First and foremost, this is a dance album.   If you do not like dance music, I don't recommend it.  For anyone else, try it out &amp; trust me you will like it, if not love it!!!  As with all albums, not every song on here is fantastic.  There are a few, like 'Your Love' &amp; 'Come Into My World' that really don't fit in &amp; I think they are just plain boring!   But then there are some really REALLY terrific songs like the obvious 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' and then others like 'In Your Eyes', 'Love At First Sight',  'Dancefloor', 'Love Affair' and the ever-so-catchy 'Fever'.   The best way to describe the overall sound of the album is that it has some Modjo-esque (Modjo being the artist who did 'Lady' &amp; 'Chillin') sounds &amp; some disco influences that were very evident on 'Light Years' but they are more subtle on this album.   This is a great album, whether you're a Kylie fan or not, or if you're just someone who enjoys great music &amp; has no idea who Kylie Minogue is!
B00003CXTG|4.0|No, Pearl Harbor isn't the best war movie ever made, but in catering to an 'Attention-Span-Challenged' audience, it delivers in both historical usefulness and watchability. Ben Affleck sold me on the idea that he was a 'hot-shot' pilot (sort of like the Tom Cruise character in 'Top Gun', also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer). The British Beckinsale pulled off being an American girl very well. The special effects used in the re-creation of the December 7 attack were breathtakingly realistic.<br />The love stories do lack some spark, but they're by no means bad. The historical tale will be compelling to young people just learning about WWII. The bonus documentaries are top shelf. It is definitely worth your attention.
B00005QK5X|5.0|This 3CD box contains the first three LPs by the Wipers (Is this real?, Youth of America, Over the edge) plus a lot of unreleased tracks, alternate takes and the Alien Boy EP. After you revel about the price that you get all these, it's time to start listening. Greg Sage transformed punk  into a unique sounding genre of pounding guitars that are not afraid to wander away in lenghty solos, while the vocals retained the edginess and the spite found in more traditional punk albums. I'm sure that people of both camps were shocked at that time (anyway those lucky enough to listen to it).  <BR>The guitar riffs will haunt you from the first moment, the bass lines will hit you in the gut and the voice, the desperate voice of Sage is conformity's worst nightmare.  Sage has always been in a league of his own and even though today the Wipers are not as dangerous as they used to be, those 3 LPs will assure you that he and his band deserve every single praise they have received in the last 20 years. I urge you to get this one. You won't regret it.
0064407667|5.0|I realy like this series.  Almost as much as I like the Left Behind series.  These books are very imaginative.  The Author is has a very big imagination, and that is what you need to right books.  When I first read the back of the book I thought I've GOT to have this.  It is great for children and Adults alike.  I work in a bookstore so I know books. This is very good.

B00005JKHP|3.0|One would think that, given some 20 odd years to work on it that when they decided to issue a director's edition they would make certain that they had all of their ducks in a row before releasing it.<br />Yes, the new special effects are superb. Yes, unnecessary elements have been removed. However, most of the original backgroud sound effects, voice overs, etc. have also been removed. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, in several instances it was a bad move. <br />Two scenes in particular stand out for this reason: each of them was better with the original voice overs simply because they contained key information that is important to the plot. In one instance, Kirk asks a question; in the original version, he receives a voice over reply to his question, in the new version he is apparently being ignored. Another example is a scene in which the original features a voice over informing Kirk of a ship appraoching. In the new version, Kirk is apparently responding to nothing at all and Uhura is referencing something that the viewer would not know about unless they had seen the original.<br />All in all, B+. Good, but could have been better...
078322687X|5.0|As a teenager in the late 90's, I find that I can relate to this movie more than I can relate to any movie made during my teen years. It has all the elements of a classic teen angst movie without all the sugary soppines and silliness that you find in almost every teen movie made nowadays. It's funny, sad, emotional, and most of all it's real.

0446677450|4.0|If you want a motivational tool to assist you in overcoming financial illiteracy, advice on what to do with money once you make it, how to keep people from taking money from you, how to make your money work for you and see how highly educated professionals get locked into the rat race...this book is for you.<br />I saw Robert T. Kiyosaki on Oprah discussing this book.  I purchased the book days after the interview.  This is a book that you want to purchase extra copies for your friends and loved ones that do not have six figure incomes.  You will not want to loan your copy out and you may want to have a highlighter handy once you begin reading it.<br />If you are a person that makes a six figure salary...this book is NOT for you (you should already know the basic financial principles, have a financial planner and accountant) unless you just want to add it to your resource library and write it off on your taxes.
B00004Z459|5.0|I am not usually a rock/rap listener, but this one made me one. The combination of the two made this cd really good. I hope the second cd of the group will be as good as the this one.
B000000OA6|5.0|I bought this album for a couple years ago. The content in this album just blew me away. I knew that Freddie was suffering from AIDS during the Miracle and Innuendo session, but that he was still going strong was a miracle. The album starts of in a fine way with the epic song called Innuendo, with a fantastic spanish guitar solo in the middle. Then the album keeps going with songs like Headlong, Dont Try So Hard, These Are The Days Of Our Lives and of course The Show Must Go On, which in my opionion is one of the best songs that Queen have ever done. I rank this album very high in my collection because every times I hear it, it moves me very deeply. The Show Must Go On finishes the album in a great way.
6303073107|5.0|I watched this movie several times in my youth. It's miraculous! This was the first Kurosawa's movie I saw. That prompted me to see his two other movies - Ran and Seven Samurais. When Rashomon became available in our local library (two years ago) it became the most popular video for over several weeks. The very moment it was returned to the library - was immediately taken by a library member.<br />The crucial personality of this movie is not bandit Tayomaru nor the killed man, nor the killed man's wife. It's the witness, the logger. <br />For him, the truth, the fight of two men and the death of one of them, is an unbearable burden. The logger did not want to accept it as truth, he did not want what's happened to happen. Even - he did not want to be a witness - he was simply doomed to be a witness.<br />He knew the truth but not able to deliver it to anybody. He is not a coward - rather a man that cannot accept the truth and unpredictable and not known cosequence of delivering it to the court.<br />The dagger he took and, probably sold in order to overcome some of the difficulties of his, poor man everyday's life - is just an expensive \\"loan\\" which he decided to pay in full by adopting the abandoned baby.<br />How much this world be more beautiful if every living man decides to redem himself the way this logger/witness did do?

This young artist has made her way on the music scene and quickly proved that she is capable of moving audiences of all races, colors and creed.  India Aire's funky style reminds us of the great Lauryn Hill, but she obviously has her own unique twist that is going to secure her with consistently high ratings.  One of the first singles released from the album, &quot;Strength, Courage and Wisdom&quot; is an inspiration to women and men across the entire world, but particularly a testament to the strength, wisdom and courage of African American women historically.

B0000041A9|5.0|There is really little I can add to the previous reviews, with the exception of stradgirl's horrible review, other than that this the best currently available and will likely remain so. THe only drawback is the ADD sound, as this recording was made several years ago.
B000002HHB|5.0|I bought this album for the 2 excellent radio hits Carnival and Wonder and frankly didn't give the rest of the album a chance for quite some time.  It was only after kind of accidentally listening to more of the album a few times that I realized - hey this is pretty good.  Now the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Most of the songs on this album are slow paced, but definitely not boring, all her songs have a subtle edge to them.  I've always liked 10K Maniacs, but frankly I like this album better than any of theirs...
B00000K0T8|4.0|(actually 4.5)<br />Dont Get me wrong it is still a tight album and i listen to it regularly but I cant call this a classic.  It has its fair share of ups and downs but the weaker songs really detract from this cd.  For Example Wildflower, Ghostface curses more on this song than on the rest of the cd combined...and basically there is no point to the whole song.  Poisonous Darts is plain wack and thats unusual for RZA.  Fish is an average song with nothing to deviate it from the rest of the album and Marvel is the same way.<br />However Ghost's rhymes are amazing and his partners Raekwon and Cappadonna as well as the rest of the Wu stop by the studio to get in on this album.  Cappadonna who is usually wack comes pretty ill on this album and Raekwon comes hard but not as hard as he did on his own Cuban Linx album.  The skits and intros into the songs are great to listen to and make this a sorta cinematic experience.  The skits don't detract from the quality of the cd.<br />The stand out songs include Iron Maiden( arguably the best song on the album------great beat, flow and lyrics), 260, Assassination Day, Box In Hand, Winter Warz, Camay, Daytona 500, All That I got Is You, and Motherless Child.  <br />At first I didn't like one bit of this cd.  But then gradually, as I began to listen to it more, it grew on me.  However it is no masterpiece but still an extremely good album but not as good as Cuban Linx.  I just think that Ghostface got skimped on the beats by RZA but it all boils down to personal preference.  Alright enough babbling you should just buy the album because it will prove to be an entertaining listen and a worthy addition to your collection.  Recommended.

B000002UUX|5.0|This is the second best Megadeth album. It only falls short of the best thrash record period Peace Sells....But Who's Buying? I don't understand how any metal fan could not like this. The thing that makes it so good is that it is so unpredictable. (...) boring metal like Metallica is just Intro,Two sets of lyrics, a chorus,a solo, and then repeat the chorus again and again and again. I can tell you what each Metallica song is going to sound like after the first 15 seconds. Megadeth on the otherhand is just great. You never know what is going to happen, and Megadeth never had any choruses untill Countdown To Extinction Where they became more like (...) Metallica. This album has the best guitar solos I have ever heard Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine are the two best guitar players in metal. Buy this album today you will not be disapointed I promise.
0060934719|4.0|_Stardust_, an original fairy tale by Neil Gaiman, is filled with enchantment, wonder, and a splash of humor.  Tristran Thorn, who doesn't know he's half-faery, sets out to find a fallen star in the hopes of winning the hand of the lovely but icy Victoria.  Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, the star fell into Faerie, and so that's where he has to go.  But what if a powerful witch and three feuding heirs to the throne of Stormhold are all looking for it too, for their own reasons?  And what if the star has a mind of her own?  Much complication follows.  The basic plot is so familiar-feeling that it isn't hard to predict the ending--it feels just like an old hearth-tale passed down through generations--and yet it is utterly original and full of surprises.<br />(Note to Tori Amos fans: Tori has a brief cameo in _Stardust_; I didn't figure it out until I read the acknowledgements at the end.  But now that line in &quot;Horses&quot; makes so much more sense...)
B00005R2M3|5.0|Ok! Jenn Lopez move over. Ricky Martin start shakin your bon bon!<BR>This lady writes her OWN MUSIC (hint hint). THis album is by far the best of my 2001 collection. <BR>The songs are amazing. SHe purrs like a cat in heat then screams that rock vibe.<BR>This is a breakout thats worth buying. &quot;Whenever ,Wherever&quot; just sets a pop tone. But when she releases the next song..its gonna be way different from that. &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is a metaphorical song that is so sexy but rocking!!<BR>&quot;Ojos Asi-Eyes like yours&quot; just makes you want to dance with the tribal beat and the way she sings! get ready to dance.<BR>&quot;Poen to a Horse&quot; is cute and totally great!!<BR>&quot;Tango&quot; begins like a wicked spanish pop start but gets a great vibe with the tribla background mixed with rock and latin influences..the best line is &quot;I love you for free and I'm not your mother!&quot; oh thats so vindictive.<BR>It reminds me of how I was excited to hear Alanis Morrissette or Sheryl Crow cuss out the men. NO bad language her but she totally holds her own. I hope she makes more ENGLIsh Language albums. I love the past two &quot;Donde Las Ladrones&quot; and &quot;MTV UNPLUGGED&quot; are awesome..yet I don't know alot of SPanish!!<BR>BUY THIS FOR A FRIEND WHO LIKES JENN LOPEZ OR RICKY MARTIN AND BLOW THEIR MINDS!!!

B00005RFQ5|1.0|Prince has the chops and skills to put out great material.  However, his extremely inconsistent material released since the last part of the nineties has turned away a majority of his fans and left him with nothing more than a hardcore following.  This CD will ultimately receive little or no airplay and will only be bought by those fans.  Prince has cleaned up his act and put out the most mature sounding CD of his career.  However, the lack of commercial material and hooks that brought this man to fame are nowhere to be found.  Prince's jazz experimentation and holy lyrics are interesting.  However, the mass audience will not take this collection seriously.
6300215717|5.0|I highly recommend this film. They don't make them like this anymore.  \\"Roman Holiday,\\" with Grgory Peck and th elovely Audrey Hepburn is a very romantic and entertaining story of a princess who falls in love with a newspaper man.  It's  a must see film.
0790732017|4.0|While not alltogether satisfying as a whole,PAPILLON is still well worth seeing.The film has long stretches without dialogues that can annoy you considering the running time of the movie.Parts of the script are not clear;the best example being the use of flashbacks.McQUEEN and HOFFMAN are well casted.Still ,something is missing to make it great and unique.To excuse the scriptwriters,i shall say that the book was not easy to adapt to the screen.Since it was a true story,it can't be can like a novel.Watch out for that scene in the leperous colony.Favorite moment:PAPILLON and his friend being fooled by a guy who promised them a boat for their money.

0064471837|5.0|This might be the only time I can say this, but I read the book through 3 times before I finally put it down.  I read it through breakfast, lunch, dinner and finally got so tired at 1:00 am I had to sleep.<br />All the perils Sabriel faces makes me feel like my own life is much easier.  She gets chased by undead beings, wades into the many depths of Hell, feels the broken energy of Charter stones, but still manages to keep her cool.<br />Nix's rhythmic writing is powerful and spellbinding.  He uses such capturing words that you are sucked into the world.<br />This was my favorite book until I read Shade's Children (Garth Nix's other sci-fi/fantasy thriller).  No matter how many times I read it, Sabriel still gives me prickly (yes, prickly)skin.
B00004XMTH|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber's &quot;Cats&quot; is a great musical.  This vidio I highly recommend and would give it ten stars if I could.

B00003CY0V|2.0|otherwise you should steer clear.  cheadle gives a good performance (as he did in oceans 11, another not so great flick), and jackman holds his own but more wasted star power with the likes of travolta and berry.  another rising star is vinnie jones, the british tough guy who works for travolta's character.  if you like the few moments he did have, go see snatch and lock, stock and two smoking barrels, he's great in those movies.  if not, you should see them anyway cause they're great movies.  anyway, just another high action blow stuff up kill people kinda movie, hollywood (stuff)that actually looked good in the preview.  in fact, if you went on the poster alone this movie would get 5 stars, but you can't judge a book by its cover, can you?

He definately can't be pushed in certain corners 'cause his music and talents are simply too large for that.<br />This album grows on you the more you hear it, some songs grab you right from the start and others you need to hear more often before you realize how incredibly beautiful they are!<BR>But then it is Liberty Hall and you wonder why you haven't heard all the dimensions before! :) I guess that is because our systems just can handle so many ranges all at once.<br />I can start to analyze the songs but I won't. However creative and intelligent this album is doesn't matter. His voice let you feel where it comes from: THE HEART! And makes yours awake.....<br />Do I need to say more?<BR>No, so period.
0876855575|5.0|This was my first book by Bukowski that I've read and found it worth my time.  He takes the reader through a child's not so pleasant life.  I really took to Bukowski's writing and have started reading &quot;Women&quot;.  So far so good.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This very mysterious band from Iceland offers in this album a seamless masterpiece of haunting mood music. The average song length is around seven minutes, and the songs segue into each other so seamlessly that you perceive this album as an integrated whole, and a continuous flow of sounds and feelings. This mood music can be compared to Enya, a very very laid-back Massive Attack (without most of the beats), or even the quieter and more operatic moments of Nine Inch Nails (without the anger). &quot;Vidrar vel til loftarasa&quot; even reminds me a bit of classic Pink Floyd. Critics will automatically try to draw comparisons to that other famous Icelandic person, but there are some similarities, at least at a high cultural level. The flowing ambient dirges on the album are occasionally, and sometimes jarringly, broken up by strange codas. This includes the scratchy, out-of-tune guitar that pops up a few times in &quot;Staralfur,&quot; the loud drums that suddenly appear five minutes into &quot;Ny batteri,&quot; or the unexpectedly bluesy organ and harmonica in &quot;Hjartad hamast.&quot; The infrequent vocals on this album are apparently sung in the band's own language, a hybrid of Icelandic, English, and who knows what else, that they call &quot;Hopelandic.&quot; If you're interested in this group, try to dig up info online, because the sparse booklet with this CD contains just a few illustrations of aliens, and just a little info in Icelandic. So I have a feeling these guys want to remain this mysterious, but that's a perfect image for the intriguing music they have created.

0784011222|4.0|One of the three best films in the RAMBO trilogy.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is a truly magnificent film. My primary criteria for any film is whether it entertained me, and this one did the job handily.<br />This is not just a historical film focused exclusively on the attack on Pearl Harbor that plunged America into war with Japan 60 years ago. It goes beyond that day of infamy to show us the relationship between two men who grew up together, and found their lives profoundly affected by that event. It also shows how their relationship with one another, and with a woman they both love, are affected by the events unfolding in their time.<br />While the film is somewhat long, running just over 3 hours, it holds viewer interest all the way through. The dedication displayed by director Michael Bay in portraying the era with accuracy is evident throughout. Everything from costumes to sets, from automobiles to planes and ships is faithfully rendered as it might have been in 1941. You feel that you have been transported to that era, and are witness to a different time and more innocent culture. It feels like 1941, and is rendered with complete believability.<br />The only flaw I found in the film is their employ of 3 battleships of later vintage than those that would have been at Pearl Harbor at the outset of World War 2. This is a minor flaw, and easily ignored by all but the most hardcore purist.<br />The special effects are enormous, and buffeted by incredible CGI work. The explosion of the USS Arizona, in particular, is rendered in heartbreaking detail. This particular special effect is totally amazing. So too is the scene of the USS Oklahoma capsizing.<br />Much of what is included in the film are vignettes culled from eyewitness accounts of those who were there and witnessed the events unfold. You will see, throughout the attack, individual details that were provided by the men and women who were there on that fateful day. These individual incidents were faithfully and accurately rendered in the film as they happened on December 7th, 1941. These lend credibility to the film, and help us experience what happened on that day.<br />This film is altogether wonderful, entirely entertaining, and totally marvelous. The cast, led by Ben Affleck, give us believable characters with whom we can identify. The immensity of the project is evident throughout. The audio quality is absolutely breathtaking, and the special effects outstanding!<br />Get this film, enjoy the show, and marvel at the effort involved. I am confident you will find it a rewarding film experience that you will watch time and again. I totally recommend Pearl Harbor. This is a great movie., 1941.

014028009X|4.0|Bridget Jones is hapless, pathetic, sad, lonely, funny, endearing and very believable. Her rambling journal entries depict a young woman obsessed with her weight and alcohol consumption and cigarette habit. Her diary each day begins with her weight, and includes references to how many units of alcohol she consumed the prior day, plus caloric intake and cigarettes. When she's happy all of the above are declining, when she's not, the opposite occurs. Even her family life is falling apart, because her Mum has left her Dad and is seeing someone else, and her Dad is miserable and crying on her shoulder incessantly.<br />Bridget is a publisher's assistant in a London publishing house, and begins an affair with her boss, Daniel Cleaver. But he's a scoundrel and only seems to be interested in her when he wants sex, and the rest of the time, forgets about her. She keeps hoping that the relationship will turn into something else. She eventually discovers that he's seeing someone else, and is devastated by the failure of yet another relationship. Her family is always asking her why she's not married yet, and it seems that everyone in the world is part of a couple except her.<br />Her family keeps trying to set her up with Mark Darcy, a divorced successful, boring barrister, but sparks fly whenever she meets him and they don't seem to have anything in common.<br />She decides to change careers in order to get away from Daniel, and to take control of her life. She becomes a tv reporter for an independent cable station, but isn't particularly successful at that either. Mark Darcy gives her an exclusive interview after a highly publicized trial, and she achieves instant recognition and respect in her field.<br />Her attempts at self-improvement (feng shui, gourmet cooking, exercising, etc.) are hilarious and short-lived. Her friends are all equally frustrated and misdirected. In spite of her many flaws, she will eventually find someone who loves her just the way she is. If she had known that all along, maybe she wouldn't have tormented herself in the pursuit of perfection.d known that all along, maybe she wouldn't have tormented herself in the pursuit of perfection.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I hsd not seen &quot;Lawrence of &quot;Arabia&quot; until recently, when I selected it from my growing DVD collection to watch on the tv at the foot of my sickbed. zfrom start to finish, I was enthralled. Other reviewers have said, much better than I could,&quot; why this film is a triumph in every way a motion picture can be. For me, this has been a eye-opener, a repudiation of the snobbish &quot;Oh, it can't be THAT good&quot; attitude that kept me from going to see some of the better  films of my youth. Now, with DVD and bigscreen television, I am getting a second chance. I saw nothing I did not find fabulous, and I could not recommend this film more highly. It is an absolute&quot;must see.&quot;
B00005QDW5|4.0|I practicaly grew up on Pink Floyd. My parents were teenagers when they started blowing up so I've had to endure through the torture of classic rock. (Not that it's all that bad...) I actually used to make fun of the music they listened to, but now that I'm getting older I'm beggining to embrace this new-found respect for them. And with all the greatest hits albums flooding record stores this has been one of the finer ones to drown in. It includes timeless songs like A Brick In The Wall (Part 2), Money, Sorrow, Time, Comfortably Numb, Learning To Fly, One Of These Days, and High Hopes. But while some of the songs seemed to be a stopper in the doorway - for they were way too long and/or too slow - they usually led to the more cresending numbers which are the real ones to open your ears to. I also like the surprisingly jazzy Us And Them and When The Tigers Broke Free, which reminds me of Depeche Mode because of the choir humming behind the lead vocalist. Don't get me wrong, though. Some slow songs ARE good, like The Fletcher Memorial Home...<br />ECHOES is a perfect starting point for the virginal ears of Pink Floyd. I for one have been drawn into their history of musical bliss as I've been devouring it since purchase. It's been spinning in my player almost everyday now, and that's no complaint. I also like how inside the booklet they show you all the album covers and tell you what year the songs came out in.<br />Overall ECHOES is a grand CD for any music collector to own. I just feel that a couple songs that weren't on here should have been. Lets leave this on a positive note, though, as I claim you to buy this. It's well worth the money spent.
B00005214X|5.0|George was always my second favorite beatle (John Lennon being my favorite).  This is truely George's masterpiece, there isn't a bad song on the album, even the additional tracks are outstanding.  &quot;I Live For You&quot; being the real stand-out of the additional tracks, it's hard to believe this song wasn't included on the original album, a supurb song!  As for the rest of the album the real stand-outs are, &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot;, My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;What is Life&quot;, &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot;, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, &quot;I Dig Love&quot;, &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot;.  The others are also outstanding, these are just my personal favorite tracks. &quot;I Live For You&quot; is the best on the album, again, it's hard to believe it was left off the original album.  My 3rd favorite beatles solo album, just behind Lennon Masterpieces &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot;.  Rest in peace George, You may have left us to join &quot;Your sweet lord&quot; but your music and legacy will live on forever, Rock on with John!

The Glasse's house and the Glasses themselves seem great at first glance, but suddenly strange occurences begin to happen and Ruby begins to uncover the horrible truth behind the Glasses and the deaths of her parents. The truth lies deep in the glass house.<br />This is a first rate thriller, I must say. It is jam packed with suspence and interesting twists that glue your eyeballs to the screen. All the actors give great performances, especially the young and lovely LeeLee Sobieski as the troubled Ruby. The film does not rely on the gore and blood but more on the situation istelf and the jolting suspence which is a nice change from alot the thrillers now a days. So just sit back and get ready to walk in &quot;The Glass House&quot;!<br />Overall: A first rate thriller that fully relies on the suspence and not the gore!<br />Grade: A+
B00005AR3G|5.0|When an emperor with an attitude is turned into a llama by his evil advisor, he must accept the help of a lowly peasant in order to get back to his castle and change back into a human.  Along the way, the emperor becomes less selfish and develops a friendship with the peasant.<br />One of the funniest Disney films around, this movie will please people of all ages.  Although it uses simple animation (no high-tech stuff here), I find the animation in this movie to be very entertaining.  Instead of trying to overload you with pretty pictures, the movie focuses on the storyline and does an excellent job.  The movie will keep you laughing by using sarcasm and wit.<br />The movie also delivers an important message of working together with other people.  We should all try to get along with each other.  This is an excellent movie that everyone should watch.
B00005RHGK|5.0|A brother and sister are driving home from college to see their family on a break. But their voyage is soon stopped when a mysterious being begins stalking them, following their every move<BR>and making sure they don't get home alive. This is going to be creepy.<br />This is a great, great horror film! Finally, we have a film that actually is quite original and is not predictable at all. The performances are very good, especially from the beautiful Gina Phillips as the older sister Trish. The being or creature you might say in the film looks outstanding and is very creepy looking. There is gore and suspence all around and the climax is truely shocking! (...) go rent this film at your local video store, pop it in to your VCR or DVD player, and get ready for a great thrillride! <br />Overall: A great, great horror film with a climax that is truely shocking!<br />Grade: A+
B000002UAU|4.0|Sgt. Peppers is a good album to to call it one of the best ever and Beatles best ever is pathetic! Like one other reviewer said, Magicla Mystery Tour is so much better than this album but in my opinion is still sadly overlooked because of the film that came along with it and usually people are so turned away fro that they don't give the album the respect that it's due. Sure Pepper's has some great songs on it (A Day In The Life is quite possibly one of their best and one of the best songs ever by anyone)and other songs like Lovely Rita, Getting Better, With A Little Help, and Lucy are good but the rest is filler and throw aways. So what if Lennon took the entire song for Mr. Kite off a Circus poster...the song isn't that great. Fixing A Hole is a very weak tune as is the title track which really isn't much (neither is the reprise except for it's used mainly as a intro to A Day In The Life). To me when I sit there and listen to an album like this and Pet Sounds they don't sound like anything special (Pet Sounds has a few good songs)but of course back in the day they were revolutionary and things nobody has heard before but as the years went on they lost their power and aren't as influental to generations that were not old enough to buy those albums. Many will disagree with me but I feel nothing can compare to The White Album...by far the Beatles best because it's all four of them getting chances to contribute unlike the previous albums where Ringo and George (r.i.p.) were given one of two songs and most of the time they didn't pull them off very well. While many complain that album is way too long in my opinion it's not at all. That album was such a revolution and such a different album for those times and was a bigger influence on many bands to come than Sgt. Pepper's ever would be. I'm not saying don't get Sgt. Peppers because it's worth a listen and while these are personal opinions only you may or may not disagree with me but I still feel this album (and even Abbey Road)are the bands most overrated albums to date while Thw White Album, Magical Mystery Tour and even Let It Be are sadly overlooked albums for various reasons which don't seem good!

B00005LOUQ|5.0|The classic book by Dr.Suess finaly came to life.  Jim Carrey stared as the grinch.  This was the greatest movie I've seen this year.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Other than special effects, I find nothing memorable about this film. The misinterpretation of historic fact borders on the hysterical, and to some degree almost criminal.  The film does a diservice to all those who perished in the attack, and especially those who survived and fought to keep America free.  For those who are interested in Pearl Harbor, and are looking for a more accurate portrayal, get Tora Tora Tora.  This movie should die a unlamented death.
0679411585|5.0|Lt Gen Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and Joseph L. Galloway's book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...and Young&quot; is simply once of the best books on a combat situation that I have ever read!  It is informative and very easy to follow.  Once I started reading, I found it very hard to set it down.<BR>Unlike many of the stories, movies, and books about the Vietnam veterans which question the abilities, leadership, and bravery of the US fighting man, this one shows then for what they are...simply the best of this country!<BR>I can strongly recommend this book and only hope that you also might have the opportunity that I have had to meet General Moore in person.  That experience only brings these stories to life in a matter that no book can do.  Don't miss this one!
B0000584V3|5.0|Ya know I used to like metal. nowadays metal is bland, commercial (stuff). Especially the commercial stuff like what KoRn and Metallica are doing nowadays. Nowadays everything seems to be about money. And ways to aquire it. And usually this means selling out. Even in the extreme metal genre i see this happen... I mean what the heck happened to Dimmu borgir or Cradle Of Filth. Sure it's catchy and it sounds pretty but do they make beautiful music that's both art and honest? no...<BR>What then about Opeth... Wel I'll tell you this.. They're one diverse band. They mix loud parts with soft parts and they make it work. See people, if music is art then Opeth are making it.<br />This album is heavy, really heavy.. And the lyrics are reflective... They reflect the atmosphere of the songs... And what great songs they are... From the melancholy of Harvest to the doom of Blackwater Park this album deals with a whole bunch of negative emotions.. and that is how it should be. Metal isn't meant to be pretty or happy. It's hard and cold and ugly and Opeth have proven that there's still a few people left that know how to make awesome music that's both brutally honest and genuinely harsh.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Matrix asks the important question &quot;What is reality&quot;. &quot;What if we are actually asleep and dreaming our reality?&quot; Buddha, Heraclitus, Socrates, and Gurdjeff all knew that most people are asleep, and that the true problem for mankind and womankind is how to wake up.<br />Also, in excellent mystic or Zen fashion, the oracle, an unassuming black housewife, tells our hero, what he needs to know, not what he wants to know, or doesn't want to know. By not taken either of two alternatives, Neo transcends the artificially created reality of computer &quot;intelligence&quot;. It is not the road you know, but the road you walk.<br />Ultimately it is love which defies computer intelligence in this very intelligently written and this film which is a true masterpiece.
B00005J9U1|5.0|If you enjoy listening to the laid back sounds of the peaceful Caribbean, these `jam`-packed recordings are basically all you'll ever cherish. Included are the true classics Three Little Birds, Jamming, [Roots, Rock, Raggae], Waiting In Vain, Stir It Up, [Get Up, Stand Up], Turn Your Lights Down Low, Could You Be Loved, Exodus and Buffalo Soldier to the original I Shot The Sheriff and uplifting title track give most any listener an incomparable sense of relaxation. Of course, this anthology would probably be lacking for die-hard Marley fans, but for 80%+ others one surely cannot go wrong. So give yourself a subtle break - light up an unprovoking joint or what have you, set your mind on the sunscaped beaches of Jamaica with some bottle of rum at your disposal and experience the music genius of Reggae's premier accomplished king. Forget about the Legends CD because that disc long ran its course. ONE LOVE again has every memorable/appreciated song you'll more than likely want from this master. As No Woman No Cry plays Live, most encompassing tracks reciprocate with loving purpose...
0385505833|1.0|This book should have been titled, Thinking About Skipping Christmas, or something to that effect.  Anyone, like myself, who is reading this book for some kind of statement about the commercialization and exploitation of the holiday, should look elsewhere because it just isn't going to happen here...although every indication is given that that is what this book is about, including the title.<br />There are a lot of comparisions to It's A Wonderful Life, but at least IAWL gave you a plausible reason for the sappily happy ending.  No such luck with this one.  Something happens, which is revealed by other reviewers, and everything the story has been building up to for the entire first half of the book goes out the window.<br />Aside from the main character, who apparently is married to some twisted version of Peg Bundy, there is no one in this story, in terms of characters, that is really portrayed as having any redeemable qualities.  There is a gluttony of neighbors that would make the Hatfields and McCoys cringe.<br />Do yourself a favor, reread A Christmas Carol or The Christmas Box, rather than investing the 2 hours it takes to read this terrible excuse for a Christmas book.  The only thing worse than the book is the fact that it nearly costs the same a regularbook I could have bought.
0679437223|5.0|Joseph Heller's, Catch 22, is without fail one of the best books ever written. If VH1 did an award's show for books this one would win in &quot;Damn I Wish I Wrote That&quot;. This is a powerful book that can alter your reality!
B000002UV9|5.0|That's all I can say! Who are these guys? I wish they were popular nowadays. This reminds me a lot of...Hmmn, I can't think of any band that sounds like this! (fanfare) ORIGINALITY! Ok, it's alittle poppy, but it's pretty good too. I heard people comparing this group to 80's hair metal. WRONG! How dare you even say that! This band is like old Pink Floyd then hair metal. I didn't know that this band was popular back then. I'll have to check them out! Best tracks:Best I Can and Della Brown.
B00000255O|5.0|Crikey. Herbie Hancock is soooooooo funky.<BR>The third, I believe, chronologically in his groovy period, and none the lesser than his previous releases. I believe Thrust to be his greatest work still, with this coming in a close second. This is a lot more downtempo than Thrust. There are still fast pieces on here but there isn't that latin insanity of the rhythm section. Much funkier, with a bunch of experimentation with synthesizers (check out the bassline on Steppin In It)<BR>I love this period of Hancock, and I love this cd. Get this.
B000002JPA|2.0|Hmmn, a band that combines old school progressive rock like Rush, Kansas, and Yes, and combines metal like Metallica and Queen-something. Queensryche? Yeah, that's their name. Well, anyway, I smell failure.<br />And I sort of did.<br />This album, while it has its moments, failed to impress me. There were too many musicial parts and not enough of the songs. I understand that they're a progreesive rock band, but they need some direction. Ok, Another Day, Surrounded,, Pull Me Under, and Wait For Sleep is good, in fact, great, but the other go on and on until you just want to skip it. Oh well, maybe I got one of the bad albums. I hope next time they'll be good.
B000002MQ9|5.0|I was introduced to Dead Can Dance by buying the soundtrack to the film/documentary Baraka. When I heard the song &quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot;, I was truly enthralled by this beautiful, awe-inspiring piece. So I decided that I wanted to hear other songs from this group,even though I was a bit skeptical: suppose Host of Seraphim was the only good song they did? I answered my own question when I bought &quot;Within the Realm of a Dying Sun&quot;.<br />Needless to say, this whole CD is absolutely wonderful! Brenden Perry's and Lisa Gerrard's voices are truly beautiful. My favorite songs are Anywhere Out of the World(very melancholy music but nonetheless a gorgeous piece with Brenden Perry's somber voice), Cantara(an Indian-techno piece), and Dawn of the Iconoclast (the trumpets and drums reminds me of the imagery of the judgement day when all men are reckoned before God); but all the songs are equally divine.<br />Is this considered Gothic music? Maybe....but it can be enjoyed by anyone despite their taste of music. Absolutely no heavy metal on this piece....most of the CD is really melancholy pieces, but not sooo somber that you get depressed. Beautiful music indeed.<br />Worth the money!!!!<br />:-)
0385505833|2.0|Skipping Christmas is well-written and has a few amusing moments.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the book.<br />A more obnoxious group of characters I never hope to meet, with the possible exception of Luther himself.  (His daughter and her boyfriend are nice, but they only appear at the very end of the story).  Nora is totally disgusting.  How could any man stay married to her?  And the shallow stupidity of the neighbors! Even the woman with cancer is unsympathetic.<br /> Luther should have skipped the whole lot of them and joined his daughter in the Peace Corps.
B00005ALP6|1.0|The role of Eliza Doolittle My Fair Lady was originally created by Dame Julie Andrews. Who was superbly spectacular- no one could take place. Which is why i can't stand watching this movie! Audrey Hepburn (who was only good in Breakfast At Tiffany's) was horribly mis-cast! First of all, Audrey cannot even sing! She was dubbed- and Marni nixon (the one who dubbed her)isn't even that good. Julie Andrews acted and sung the pact perfectly. But it's ok because Julie won an Academy Award the year My Fair Lady came out anyway- for Mary Poppins- Audrey wasn't even nominated- with good reason too. And you gotta love Rex Harrison, who also created the role of henry higgins alongside Julie Andrews on Broadway. Because Rex fought and fought to get Julie Andrews on the movie of My Fair Lady. This movie is nothing because julie is not in it- (...)But, we later found out that even Jack Warner voted for Julie at the Academy Awards- which she won!

B00004XOWM|5.0|This is one of the best Limp Bizkit CD's out there. It does have some strong language, bu not as much as some rock bands these days.  My pesonal favorite song is Rollin. It has th best lyrics and is full of fun. I would recomend this CD to most people, but only if they don't mind language isues.  My advice to those readers out there is, &quot;BUY THIS CD!&quot;
0385505833|1.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and liked them all (although I thought Painted House was only 'okay'). I found his latest to be offensive (is everyone in this town christian?) and ridiculously unrealistic (why would so many people care?).  The ending, obviously, was predictable. Altogether, I would not give it one star; I found it very boring and only read it because my book group picked it. Grisham: Give me a break; go back to the genre you were meant to write in.
B00003CXV4|2.0|i watched this awhile ago and don't remember much; just that i was feeling quite unsatisfied upon leaving the theater, and felt the movie had wasted its potential.  the only great part of the movie was enya's &quot;only time&quot;.
0684833395|5.0|Does no one understand that a Story need not flow chronologically?  Does no one realize that Catch-22 decries not simply the military, but all bureaucracy and the brutality which abounds when people can hide within such complex structures?  Does no one see that Yossarian was a patriot -- only not by the definition of his countrymen?  Do any of those who denounce this book as &quot;anti-war&quot; comprehend that the only alternative to being &quot;anti-war&quot; is to be &quot;pro-war,&quot; and to be &quot;pro-war&quot; is barbaric? <BR>Is there no one righteous?
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Four classic rockers released new albums this year.  Two were overhyped and thin on quality (McCartney's and Jagger's), while the other two were released with little fanfare or PR and turned out to be fantastic (Clapton's and Bob Dylan's). 'Love and Theft' finds Dylan immersed in the blues and rock n' roll, and having a damn good time with his usual quick witted lyrics. You don't have to sit and ponder the cosmic meanings of the songs on here, either. Just pop it in the CD player and enjoy. The songs are energetic and brisk, and the band is fantastic. I know some people jump to call everything this man does as &quot;brilliant&quot; or whatever, but this album would have been good if Keith Richards had recorded it. Dylan still has a talent for writing fun, intelligent lyrics and songs that are easy to listen to. McCartney found the same kind of luck on &quot;Run Devil Run&quot;; ditto Clapton on &quot;From the Cradle&quot;. Maybe it's their age and the stage they are at in their respective careers, but these classic rockers find their best success when they go back to the basics. <br />It's not 'Time Out of Mind' or 'Blonde on Blonde'.  But if you're curious to see who the man behind the myth is, after some four decades, give 'Love and Theft' a listen. You won't be dissapointed.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is by far the best I have bought in quite some time.  It has barely left my car CD player since I got it. <br />I was never into System of a Down Before, but once I put this CD in I was hooked.  Their style is like no other band.  They are refreshingly one-of-a-kind.  If you are sick of the mundane/overplayed, pop/alternative rock, buy this!  <br />Buy this CD.  The more you listen, the more you will want to listen.  You will find yourself singing the songs as soon as you wake up!
6304167660|5.0|For a movie that did not make a splash or even a ripple when it was released ( I stumbled across it on T.V. several months ago)this show has become my favorite all time.  Dillon and his group of friends make you remember those times of hanging out worrying about trivial things like where you were going to drink beer that night or if you could make it another month with your girlfriend.  Relating to this show is easy and it makes you miss those confusing times that you relate to.  One of the best parts of this show to me is when the &quot;gang&quot; is in their neighborhood tavern run by one of their friends, his cousin played by Uma Thurman comes in and catches their attention.  All of the guys react and do their best to impress the girl from the big city.  Friends being there for each other in different ways makes this a very uplifting show.
1558216847|5.0|QUICK REVIEW<BR>This is a story of a man and his fellow prisoners who struggle to make their way to freedom. It is an incredible account of endurance and the will to survive. An all around great story that is definitely worth reading.<br />FULL REVIEW<BR>This is truly an astounding story. This book will amaze its readers and will grab their attention from the very beginning, and on through the rest of the book. You will hear of the terrible mistreatment of prisoners, but also their lasting endurance. The harshness of their travels and the weather, but also their unyielding determination. This story is about the struggle to survive intense experiences, and the drive to fight all odds for freedom. There is so much that is great about this book and if I were pressed to come up with something not good about it - there would be only two things that I could come up with. The first would be toward the end of the book when their travels take them to little village after little village. This is the only time in the whole book where it gets semi-slow, as not much is happening. The second thing is the believability of some of the facts. Just a couple of times he says what was happening or how something happened, and you wonder if that is totally possible, considering a human's level of endurance. I do not doubt that the author remembers it like he tells it, but it's possible that he was in such traumatic situations that things seemed more extreme than they might have been. It is possible that the facts are all correct, but maybe the reader should give the author a little bit of leeway to tell it exactly as he remembers it, and maybe not exactly as it was. This happens in only a couple of select parts and it does not ruin the story at all. So other than those two things it is an incredible book. It is very easy to read and to keep up with what is going on, as you feel like you are traveling with them. It is an astonishing story and definitely worth reading.
6300183971|5.0|First off, I'm not much of a fan of Herbert's novel, \\"Dune\\"; just as I am not much of a fan of the book \\"A Clockwork Orange\\". However in both cases I am a fan of the movies that were based on the literary works of the aforementioned, and feel that the films are actually much better than the books. That isn't to say that I prefer films based on literature more so than the literature itself - in the case of Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", I feel no film can compete or be compared. That said the 1984 film, Dune, is as unique, intense, and brilliant a film as can be. Visually, this film is absolutely remarkable. I only read the book once, but this film really brought to life the images I had conjured. The acting talents are equally remarkable, and there are some big, seasoned names here. The special efects are wonderful, especially for the time of its release. The costuming and characters are fairly accurate to the literature, if not originally imaginative. The differences to the literature that are presented in the film work extremely well to complement the overall viewing within the time constraints, especially if one hasn't read the book. Even Toto's musical score (although I could've done without the electric guitar) is terrific. There is little about this film I dislike. <br />I suppose the only draw back to this film would be that it may seem confusing and not descriptive enough in its story telling to certain viewers who haven't read the book - hence the TV version with deleted scenes and narrative added. Frankly, though, I really don't see what people find so confusing about this film. Read the book. I can tell you you'll be a lot more confused by the literature than this film! Besides, mystery makes for a much better experience.<br />The big question I have about this marvelous film is how much responsibility did David Lynch exercise in his direction? I heard from a previous employee of Mr. Lynch's that David was called in at \\"the last minute\\" to piece everything together. The sets, storyboard, costuming, actors, production and effects staff, etc. had already been assembled ere he arrived. Hmmmm....<br />If you're a fan of fantasy and science fiction, Dune the film is a must see, no matter who directed it.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I think most people know about Citizen Kane and know how great it is (or at least how important it is even if you don't think it is &quot;great&quot;), so I won't comment about the movie itself.  What I will comment on is the DVD and some of its special features.  As far as the DVD quality goes, this is a great transfer of this film.  I've seen it quite a few times on TV and video, but its never looked as great as this.<br />However, more than any other reason, you should get this disc for the special features.  Particularly the two commentaries by Roger Ebert and Peter Bogdanovich.  These commentaries give amazing insight into the movie and the making of the movie.  They enhance your enjoyment of the film because of the things you may not have noticed or realized during previous viewings.  The commentaries discuss everything from how a shot was created to why the shot was chosen.  There are a lot of revolutionary movie making techniques that were created during the making of this movie that we may not have realized because they are so commonplace in modern movies.  These commentaries let us know exactly what those revolutionary technics are and why they are important.<br />The Ebert review is my favorite.  He keeps you interested through the whole movie and has great insight into the movie.  Although repetitive at times and a bit rushed (which is the nature of the format since he can't exactly pause the movie for you to discuss an item at length... although that would be a very cool feature).  The Bogdanovich commentary was good as well, but a bit dry and boring at times.  He didn't have the same enthusiasm during the commentary as Ebert, but I think that's the nature of Bogdanovich and not because he isn't enthusiastic about the film.<br />This is a must have DVD for any movie fan!
B00000IL1K|4.0|Sarah Brightman's EDEN is truly paradise.  EDEN opens with the Latin \\"In Paradisum,\\" which is a stunning song that sets a mood of a serene, lush garden landscape with birds soaring in the horizon.  This song segues into the best song on EDEN, the title track \\"Eden.\\"  \\"Eden\\" is absolutely fabulous, beyond words.  It combines elements of pop with great lyrics and S. Brightman's voice moving seamlessly, yet emotionally through them.  The songs \\"So Many Things,\\" and \\"Anytime, Anywhere,\\" that follow, meld opera and pop elements beautifully.  \\"Bailero,\\" is a blemish on EDEN, but moves into the stirring \\"Dust in the Wind.\\"  \\"Il Mio Cuore Va,\\" (\\"My Heart Will Go On\\") follows, and sounds even better with Sarah at the helm and Italian as the language.  \\"Deliver Me,\\" is perhaps the second best song on EDEN.  It's inspirational, emotional, and evokes a feeling of hope.  Sarah really gets into this song, as do the wonderful backing vocalists.  Regretfully, EDEN takes a bad turn after \\"Deliver Me,\\" segueing into a period of four opera songs.  \\"Tu\\" and \\"Un Jour Il Viendra\\" are good songs, but when the lackluster \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\" and \\"Nella Fantasia\\" are thrown into the mix the songs become indistinct, forming a singular block of 15 minutes.  I prefer the isolated tastes of opera on La Luna, or the stronger songs featured on Classics, to EDEN's selections, despite the fact S. Brightman sings them all beautifully.  \\"Only an Ocean Away,\\" is five minutes of magnificence.  The instrumentation is superb, the gradual rise of emotions is typical of S. Brightman's music, and the vocals are stellar.  This romantic song is certainly a jewel on EDEN.  \\"Scne d'Amour\\" showcases the ability of Sarah to use her voice gorgeously as an instrument.  \\"Nessun Dorma,\\" although beautiful, is a little too short at 3:30 - the edition on Classics is a better recording of this operatic standard.  Track 16 \\"The Last Words You Said,\\" a lovely \\"bonus track,\\" completes EDEN on a very beautiful and romantic note, in a duet form.  EDEN, although not as grand an achievement as La Luna or as beautiful as Classics, is a strong album that shows the various shades of S. Brightman via opera, pop, and both, and is a very solid four star achievement.  If you enjoyed Eden, I really recommend La Luna (just amazing!) or, for fans of Sarah's beautiful opera, her latest offering, Classics.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I can't beleive the bad reviews for this movie. It was the most amzing movie I have ever seen. <BR>I think that people who gave it bad reviews were just expecting this to be an action movie. I'll admit it was kind of a teen, chick-flick (josh hartnett, &amp; ben afflek, hotties!) but it was still a good movie. It did have a few titanic flashbacks like the plane at sunset(I'm flying jack) the boats rowing through the bodies, and the underwater shots of the arizona; they probably could have gotten a little more original with that. But all in all it was a great movie.

B00003CX5P|1.0|Where to start.  I cannot imagine this movie being worse.  Did a monkey write the script?  Could the acting be more amatuerish?  The Jar-Jar Binks character is an absolute abomination, and the perfect descendant of those ridiculous creatures from &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; which looks like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; compared to this joke of a movie.  An utter travesty.
630575067X|1.0|I don't even know where to start.  What a joke.  Did a monkey write the horrid script?  Could the acting have been more amatuerish?  Lucas lost it after the Empire Strikes Back.  The Jar-Jar Binks abomination is the direct descendant of those cuddly little muppets in the sappy Return of the Jedi.  What a travesty.   One of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Why would he make such a statement?<br />This is, of course, a film that Fellini made about himself, is his auto-biography at that point of his life. And is a film that everything seems to work correctly: the music, photography, acting and direction of course. In a nutshell, a film that some may not like but can't say anything consistently negative against.<br />I think the second mastepiece of Fellini is Giulietta degli spiriti (Juliet of the spirits, wich there's only a limited version around in DVD), wich I carry more hauntly in my memory, but it is not as perfect as 8 1/2, i would say.<br />So, Buy this restored version of 8 1/2 and judge it for yourself.
B000002UAX|5.0|The day that George Harrison died the radio stations played a montage of some of his music. I could not help but notice the abyss of time, of how the decades since these songs were wrote have slipped by, I could almost feel time passing by as I listened. I love these songs, all are great, such as &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and many more, see the top of this page for a complete list. This CD is perhaps the best Beatles album, and deserves more than five stars and belongs in every serious music collection. <br />Indeed, I do believe that one hundred, or even one thousand years from now, when some parents somewhere play their music, and their children ask who they are, the parents will reply simply that they are the ones who started it all, the greatest.
B00005JHAD|5.0|Personally, I'm not a film fan. I mean, I can watch a good film and enjoy it, but even some of the better ones won't have me rushing to watch them more than once or twice. I never buy films, just rent them or record them off the TV. It's simply not something that concerns me - once you've seen it and you know what's coming then where's the surprise? Why waste your cash?<br />Not Snatch. Snatch is a film that I can watch over and over. I watched the intro alone 5 times in one morning. I simply cannot say enough good things about this film. The only other film that compares is Braveheart (although where Braveheart is simple yet highly effective Hollywood film, Snatch is the opposite - gritty, complex, British and full of black humour). This isn't even a comedy, yet I found myself laughing more than I ever did when I watched Scary Movie, Meet The Parents or any other naff cliche you can think of. Not that this is a cheap laugh. It also has times where you near on cry - they're that powerful. Sometimes its simply all out war, with gans blasting and boxers fighting. The music is also slick - the Russian acoustic guitars tickle my ribbs, while the fight music goes through my head every day (and I listen to metal f'crying out loud!).<br />The characters Sol, Vinny and Tyrone are also some of the funniest in the film (&quot;Never underestimate the predictablity of stupidity&quot;) while Brad Pitt is hilarious as the &quot;sweet-talking tattoo-sporting pikey&quot; (to some extent he steels the show). Mike Reid doesn't once make you think of Eastenders and Benicio Del Toro is as cool as ice. Vinnie Jones is his usual snarling self but its the grim reaper Brick Top that is the scariest character in the film.<br />Many people know Guy Richie from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but as good as that film is, it doesn't have the sheer revisitablity of this masterpiece. The comparisons to Lock Stock are justified, true, but what does that matter when the delivery is this good? Warning though, the humour is very English, as are the references and dialect - although with the amount of good comments coming from American's as well it doesn't seem to be too much of a problem. If you haven't seen it, watch it. And you have, watch it again!Warning though, the humour is very English, as are the references and dialect - although with the amount of good comments coming from American's as well it doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.

B00005OWEG|5.0|This is the definitive version of Apocalypse. It is like you are watching an entirely different film with 50 minutes of scenes put back in an already kick butt flick. The longest new scene is the erie French plantation sequence which includes a funeral for Mr. Clean(Laurence Fishburne), and a sexual-opium scene with Willard(Sheen) and one of the French colonists. <BR>     The new footage(especially the French plantation scenes) gives the film a powerful dynamic edge that the original lacked. This version takes the crew on an even trippier ride up the Nung River into Cambodia. Some of the original scenes(such as where we see Kilgore's surfboard on the PT boat) make more sense now that the deleted scenes have been added. The anti-war message is more apparent in this one also. There are new scenes involving Brando's Kurtz reading a Time magazine emphasizing in the article the lies about the war to the public by the government. The French plantation sequence is symbolic of how the French lost Indochina, yet these few colonists are hanging on to sacred ground while the war is raging on(Willard:&quot;Why don't you return to France?&quot;). Willard(SHEEN) reads from Kurtz dossier in a new sequence:&quot;As long as cold beer, hot food, and rock and roll are allowed over here, our troops will remain dilitantes and tourists&quot;
0679879269|5.0|Reading The Amber Spyglass is an experience rich with the knowledge that a classic is being read in the infanthood of its life. In the third part of His Dark Materials trilogy, Pullman continues to conduct a superior fantasy for young adults. Tiny people who ride saddled dragonflies, a harpy named &quot;Gracious Wings&quot;, and a nobel angel named Zaphania, are just a slight few of the colorful, imaginative creatures that contribute to the quest of Will and Lyra and to the destiny they painfully must endure for the rest of their lives. This novel must be read with bravado because so much death, destruction, and heart wrenching grief is intertwined with joyful, loving, exploration and discovery. Mythical in style, Pullman's work was inspired by Paradise Lost and indeed seems a modern version.
B00005R23S|5.0|BRUCE AND THE BAND TOUR EVERY FEW YEARS AND FANS CAN'T GET ENOUGH.  THIS IS LIKE A FRONT ROW SEAT AT BRUCE AND THE BAND AT THEIR BEST PERFORMANCE EVER.

B00004Z459|1.0|To put it nicely there is only one good song on this CD. I would recomend to perspective buyers to save your money and put it toward a better group like Greenday or Limpbizkit
B00004XQP4|5.0|Yes, it's a lot more mellow, and the style of the songs has changed, but i still love this CD. If you're one of those devoted to Dookie and Insomniac, this isn't for you, but if you liked Nimrod, you're probably going to like this. The songs are a lot different, take Misery for example. This song has a very naval theme to it, and uses the accordian, mandolin and farfisa (I don't know what a farfisa is or sounds like, but it's not doing the song any harm, so never mind)to create a slow song with dark humour about people's misfortunes. The only songs I could imagine coming from Dookie are Blood Sex and Booze and Church on Sunday, both of which are good songs, especially the former. Waiting is a great song despite the critics on here, one of the best on the CD. Of course, there's Minority, everyones fave, and first impressions make you think it's yours too, but if you listen to the album more, you'll probably find yourself gradually liking other songs more. Even the worst track on the album, Hold On, isn't a bad song by any means. Though the songwriting isn't as good as Nimrod's, it's deep and thoughtful, and Macy's Day Parade shows this. <BR>  So there you go. If you didn't like Nimrod as much as the earlier, heavier stuff, avoid this one, cause it's even lighter, but otherwise, buy it. You won't regret it.
B000002JS8|4.0|Most consider either Highway to Hell or Back In Black to be AC/DC's greatest album; what keeps Back In Black from being #1 is that it simply doesn't have Bon Scott as the vocalist. Though Highway to Hell is considered by many to be Bon's greatest vocal and lyrical achievement, Mutt Lange's polished production actually detracts from the unbridled fury of previous AC/DC albums. Dirty Deeds and '74 Jailbreak aside (as they were released in the U.S. following Bon's untimely death), I personally consider Let There Be Rock and Powerage as AC/DC's absolute best. Both are fun, fast and furious examples of early Vanda &amp; Young productions and can be listened to in awe all the way through. And with Highway to Hell being a close third --- never forget who was the soul of AC/DC: Bon. (R.I.P.)
B000002GJ7|5.0|Anyone who wants to experience how music is supposed to sound needs to pick up this CD.  It is outstanding.  Extreme somehow slipped though the cracks of the music world, with the exception of the obligatory power-ballad (thanks to my other fave band, Journey, for those) &quot;More Than Words&quot;.  The songs are multi-layered, the musicianship is outstanding, and the songwriting is genius.  The music is high energy, with each of the tracks reaching out and grabbing you and taking you for a spin.  I listen to this CD all the time.  &quot;He Man Woman Hater&quot; has got to be one of the best rock songs ever written.  Yet, despite the wildness of the music, the words really make you stop and contemplate...and I think that's what kept me intrigued by Extreme.  They may have been lumped with all the other &quot;Hair Bands&quot; (God I HATE that term) of the late 80's early 90's, but they were truly a thinking man's (or woman's ;P) band.  I loved the first Extreme album ,and you have got to get &quot;III Sides to Every Story&quot; as well.  You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!
B000006IUQ|4.0|I know what you're thinking, &quot;How can a movie be entertaining when it has a title as lame as 'The Edge'?&quot;  That's exactly what I thought before I'd read good reviews on it.  The plot is relatively simple: A billionaire named Charles (Hopkins) and his beauty-queen wife Micky (MacPherson) head off to Alaska for a photo-op, but Charles winds up being stranded in the Alaskan wilderness with the photographer Bob (Baldwin) and his assistant Stephen (Perrineau).  The three men then try to find ways to survive, not just against nature but among their relationships with each other as well.  <br />This is an intelligent adventure film with more dialogue than explosions.  The whole movie isn't always moving at the pace of a hardcore action flick, but when it does it leaves you biting your nails to the roots.  One of my favorite scenes is right in the beginning, where you are freaked out one moment and then breathe a sigh of relief the next.  The survival sequences are a lot of fun, and Hopkins delivers a great performance.  And the scenery is staggeringly beautiful!<br />There are a few problems with this film, however.  Elle MacPherson may be pretty, but she doesn't act very well.  Also, once in a while, the dialogue makes a vain attempt to be intelligent and winds up just being vague (like the final line of the film).  Finally, the relationship between the men gets a little illogical after the film's pinnacle of excitement (more than halfway through the film).  <br />Nevertheless, the film is quite good, and it's worthy of more than one viewing.  Show it to your friends, they may be surprised at how exciting it actually is!<br />Final note: The R-rating is there because of the violence and profanity.  The profanity never gets unreasonable; after all, it's pretty stressful to be lost in the Alaskan wilderness with nothing to eat.  The violence, however, involves intense adventure action and occasionally gets quite bloody.  It might be best if kids under 12 don't watch this film.
B000050FEN|2.0|First we're supposed to believe that Matt Damon's character is smart enough (albeit with the guidance of Morgan Freedman's character) to harass and catch a serial killer - and then we're supposed to believe that he's stupid enough to fall for the killer's trap at the end. A grotesque carnival of sickness... a horror movie... not uplifting entertainment.
B00005QAPK|4.0|Spirits of the Dead, a handsomely mounted 1967 film that features three segments from three European giants (Vadim, Malle, and Fellini) all based on Edgar Allen Poe short stories. The third segment, Fellini's Toby Dammit, is so incredibly different and dense when compared to the other two that you almost forget you've watched an anthology by the time the film ends. His work here is as good as he's ever been visually, and the world that he creates perfectly represents the inner turmoil of the self-destructive actor Toby Dammit (Terrance Stamp). The director presents his typical circus or parade; whichever you want to call it, and this time it shows the world of the celebrity in modern day Rome. It's obviously been liberally adapted from the original Poe story, and it's only nominally a horror tale (Toby is stalked by a Björk-ish devil figure), but the film transcends any generic or authorial labels: it's purely Fellini's, and at a little over forty minutes long it doesn't burn out the audience in the way that his longer pageants tend to. <br />The other two segments are certainly solid, even if they might not top Fellini's work with sheer panache. Vadim's piece is the better of the remainder, and it features Jane and Peter Fonda as feuding cousins. This is the most overtly supernatural segment of the trio, and even it feels somewhat subdued when compared to modern ghost stories. Jane Fonda is excellent in her role, and she brings a combination of refinement and haughtiness to the part that vitalizes the character. Like all of the film, this bit of the film is well shot, but Vadim's captured some gorgeous outdoor scenery, whereas the others take place mostly indoors. The tale itself is spooky enough, and the running time feels sufficient. The only real negative mark here is that the film resorts to a slightly jarring voiceover narration here to fill in background details. Malle's segment is likable enough, but it feels somewhat slighter than the other two. Its gambling scene evokes Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (just as the driving sequences in the Fellini segment recall A Clockwork Orange), even if Spirits was made several years earlier, and there is genuine tension aroused at the card table. Throughout the film, there is a relatively low gore quotient, and the acting is uniformly solid.  As far as psychological horror goes, the films work well, and that they realize Poe's stories were mainly internalized distortions of the world works to their advantage, even as they approach the material in vastly different ways.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|If you are a big MJ fan,you will love this album. Even if you are no, you will still be amazed by the music. This is the greatest selling album of all time with over 50 million copies sold. It had 7 top ten hits in 1983 including 2 #1's. This is definetly worth owning. The music brings back good memories. Billie Jean is very nice along with Beat it and Human Nature. Get this album!!
B000002JSP|5.0|I'm not sure why other Led Zeppelin fans hold such a low opinion of \\"In Through the Out Door\\" (ITTOD for short), but I for one feel it's a great testament to the power of the band. ITTOD, Zep's last true studio album, is slicker and less bluesy than previous releases. The style changes, however, don't take away from the energy of the band. Whenever I think of this album, I can't help but compare it to the previous one, \\"Presence\\". While many Zep fans might swear \\"Presence\\" is a superior album, I strongly disagree. \\"Presence\\", while having some decent material, is suprsingly flat and uninspired, two adjectives not normally used to describe Led Zeppelin. ITTOD, on the other hand, is a return to form in many respects. It's true that this album is somewhat of a departure(poppier/more synthesizer-oriented), but the power that made Zeppelin one of the mightiest bands in rock history is evident throughout, if in a different form. \\"In the Evening\\" is a great, rocking opener. \\"South Bound Saurez\\" is a fun, piano driven tune, sure to bring a smile to anyone's face. \\"Fool in the Rain\\" is also a piano driven song, with a great melody and cool salsa/carribean midsection. A friend of mine thought it was an Elton John song the first time he heard it, and it certainly has that type of feel to it. \\"Hot Dog\\" is probably the weakest song on here, but even it has it's charm. Page's guitar playing is noticably sloppy, though. \\"Carouselambra\\", despite being very annoying to some, isn't half bad. Although it's in a very different style than Zeppelin would normally do, with it's bloated synthesizers and all, it still retains the ENERGY that was mentioned before. \\"All My Love\\" is an FM rock staple and is a beautiful, emotional song. Last but not least is \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\", my favorite song on the album. I can't help but have a tear in my eye and the hair on the back of my neck stand up whenever I hear this one. Plant's scream towards the end is heart-wrenchingly powerful. It's in the vein of previous Zeppelin blues-burners like \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" and \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", if you want to know what I mean. So, overall, this album is definitely worth getting. The bottom line is, while it isn't Zep's best, it's still a great album with catchy and energetic songs. Listen to it with an open mind and it will catch on. All Zeppelin albums are worth getting (even \\"Presence\\"), and \\"In Through the Out Door\\" is no exception.
0140067477|5.0|This is a well written, easily read book that provides an introduction and explanation of the general tenets of Tao through 5 main characters and the circumstances they are confronted with.  Metaphor and real-life analysis and observation of how we live and think, and how Taoism can be applied to our perspectives and daily lives, if we want it to.  Selection from the writings of Tao Te Ching, and other Taoist thinkers to the books characters and stituations help explain the meanings for the neophyte.   <BR>    The significant influence of Puritanism on our past and present U.S. history is also delved into.  The Puritan influence has always been with us and I am convinced it always will be.  <BR>    The American work week gets longer every year, according to studies, and we have less and less time for the good things in life:  family, friends, introspection, personal growth, and even pursuing hobbies.  We are constantly running from one place to another, both literally and figuratively, in search of--something.  Fulfillment,  happiness, or what have you.  We try to buy it, acquire it, reach out to it.  But it's right in front of our faces--we just have to allow ourselves to see it.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I'll be the first to admit, the first half hour of this movie is really cheesy (with lines like Beckingsale writing to Affleck that she &quot;watches the sunrise and tries to take out each last bit of energy from it&quot; or some line that makes you want to throw up). After that however, it is a great, gripping film. Affleck, after the first half hour, is terrific and Beckingsale is adequate. Hartnett I believe is the real star of the film, in a true star making performance. The special effects are top notch as every one knows, and the ending gets you on the edge of your seat. Even as a guy, I welled up with tears when Cuba Gooding Jr. got his hands on the big machine gun and started firing away. Flawed movie? Yes. Great movie? You bet.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I would like to warn you right now, if you are buying this record and expecting The Stooges or The Velvet Underground(The lead singer sounds like Lou Reed though) then you'll be highly disappointed nor is this the greatest rock 'n' roll album in years but it sure is damn good. At best, this album sounds like an indie version of &quot;Loaded.&quot; When I first heard the record, I thought 'what is the big deal?' but it grew on me. You just can't listen to it with all the hype that The Strokes have been getting in your head. You just have to enjoy it for what it is. The highlight tracks are &quot;Barely Legal,&quot; &quot;Someday,&quot; &quot;Last Nite,&quot; and &quot;Trying Your Luck.&quot; This album is all about being young and cool and everyone being full of it (Girlfriends esp.) &quot;Is This It?&quot; is highly addictive and worth your money but it 'aint no Velvet Underground record.
B000059XUO|5.0|Okay, i don't have The Crow on DVD, (yet...) but i do have it on VHS and i must say the movie is one of my favorite movies. The movie was given to me on my birthday and i didn't think i would hate it, but i didn't think it would be on my favorites list. Anyway, the movie is full of action mixed with great dialogue as well. Since there are two other Crow sequals, i'm interested in seeing both of them. Well, actually i finally saw The Crow: Salvation and i must say that The Crow had much more charisma than this one. Salvation wasn't a bad movie, it was all right but The Crow is better. I have yet to see City of Angels and from reading some of the reviews here, i probably won't like it, but then again, you never know......
B00005Q4CS|2.0|I saw this film on the recommendation of a friend, and I admit that it does relay an extremely strong messege but it is not worth enduring the 102 minutes of disturbance.  The frightening and often grotesque images combined with haunting music does more than simply relay the director's message, it forces you to come to a relization of general disgust for society.  If you enjoyed &quot;Pie&quot; then you will probably enjoy &quot;Requiem&quot; but if you are not familiar with either movie or the director then I would advise you to take caution when choosing to watch this movie, especially around children.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I had a lot of preconceived notions about Michael Bay before I watched Pearl Harbor.  You couldn't have dragged me to go see this at the theatre.  In fact, I waited till $1 rental day to watch it.  I personally think Directors like Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich are everything that is wrong with hollywood... and I wasn't disappointed.<br />Too many movies go straight to production because of a concept, rather than taking the time and making sure the story is in place and it's something worth telling.  Of course Pearl Harbor is something worth telling, but it has to be more than that.  It's the personal stories that make it such a great and tragic story.<br />Too bad Director's like Fred Zinnemann, Michael Curtiz or Alfred Hitchcock weren't around to give this movie some substance.  Director's of that class are a dieing breed.  Meanwhile, young, visionless, money hungry, let's blow some stuff up, lets keep it moving director's are taking their place.<br />I can just imagine the pow-wow sessions that started Pearl Harbor: &quot;Lets see... the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor is coming up, gotta do a movie.  People loved Titanic.  We can't do a sequel to Titanic, but we can do another disaster.  It can happen.  Let's make Pearl Harbor the biggest POPCORN MOVIE of all time.&quot;<br />Popcorn movie....  yes, it is... and it's too bad.  Because popcorn movies are forgettable movies.  Ten years from now, we'll remember movies like Saving Private Ryan and Titanic because they had substance.  Pearl Harbor only joins the list of movies that made big money, but made no impact, like Independence Day, Armageddon, Godzilla and the Patriot.<br />On a positive note.  The movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  The performances were good.  KATE BECKINSALE was as beautiful and confident as ever.  The action sequences are incredible and intense.<br />It is a movie that has its merits. Yet, it could have been so much better had the producers taken their time, instituted more ACTUAL and FACTUAL stories and spent more time on the methods of telling a story, rather then pouring all their efforts into attack sequences.<br />Don't buy this DVD.  Another example of what I'm talking about.  The 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor came up and they had to capitalize off of that, so they rushed out a lesser version of what they're offering later down the road.  That way they can get your money twice.  The movie is divided onto two disks and the subtitles are hard to read.  If you do want to buy this, wait for the special edition director's cut DVD coming out on May 14.e ACTUAL and FACTUAL stories and spent more time on the methods of telling a story, rather then pouring all their efforts into attack sequences.<br />Don't buy this DVD.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is a mess. The storied history of the attack on Pearl Harbor has become a $100+ million dollar effects spectacular (...) and it's quite sad. <br />The script is just absolutely hideous. There is no emotional pull to draw you in and although the movie tries it ends up with only cheap melodrama in its place. The love story/best friends plotline is just a two bit way of trying to make you care what happens to the characters, but just comes off as laughable. You couldn't care a lick for anybody, and it's only made worse that the actors, particularly Baldwin and Affleck, deliver utterly inane dialogue with the most serious conviction that you end up smirking at it. Cuba Gooding had the most minor of roles in the movie so I'm not even sure why his character was even included. It added nothing whatsoever to the already weak plot. And there are plenty of other minor characters that leave you with just as much a sense of unfeeling. Affleck is also a weak, weak lead. This movie may try to mimic the feel of 1940s cinema, but Affleck is no Cary Grant, that's for sure. You end up hating him rather than identifying with him because he's so annoying.<br />There are many problems here to be sure, but the one thing I did like was Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR. Sure, his dialogue was just as weak as all the rest, but at least he was kind of convincing as a president desperate not to be seen as a physically uncapable leader. <br />You can see this movie, just don't expect much out of it. It's an embarrassment to the memory of those who lived through this horrific event. Not having this movie hadn't have been made by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, who are not known for their subtle touch, would have at least been a start to improving the quality of this movie.

The english used is superb and I loved all the book.<BR>It gives you the perfect description of the places, the volume of fire employed, the panic and everything. <BR>My compliments to the author.
B00004U30D|2.0|The best description of this movie is it is a cartoon.  Kevin Spacey seems to be acting with his tongue in cheek.  Annette Benning over-emotes to the point of being laughable; the makeup on her lover is so ridiculous as to seem to have been for a high school play.  As for the story, Mendez seems to have been making it up as he filmed it, and when he doesn't know what to do next, he throws in a sex scene. Most of the sex scenes are okay, that is they stop short of really grossing you out. I think everyone misread this movie.  It seems to aim to be a satire, but turns out just to be a lame comedy.  You can't really like anyone in the story, certainly neither of the teen-age girls, who are probably pretty typical, nor any of the adults.  The young drug dealer turns out to be the most likeable, and he's got problems. (...)
1563890410|5.0|As with its predecessors, Season of Mists is intellectual, tinged with wry humor, old myths long forgotten, and even philosophy (though expertly hidden).<br />It opens with Destiny and a beautiful description of his realm. He soon after calls a 'family meeting', the first one they'd had in quite some time. This triggers a chain of events (one event in particular) that, more or less, make up the whole novel.<br />This novel challenges common belief about heaven, hell, death, souls and everything in between, opening our eyes to new possibilities. It transcends reality, shifting you into a whole new world you have never even thought possible.<br />With a remarkable, unorthodox plot, characters far more interesting than the norm, fantastically rendered art, and smooth, amusing dialogue, this series has set a whole new standard for comics everywhere (particularly this novel, it skyrocketed The Sandman to a whole new level of thinking).<br />To put it shortly, pick it up and read it. It's more than worth your time. :)
B00005QZWJ|5.0|When I first heard Shore was writing the score I was like who is that?  And found some other soundtracks he had written.  I was a little skeptical at first, but when the CD came out I had to buy it.  Howard's melodies and use of instruments makes this one my favorite and best soundtracks out to date.  Howard has produced a completely new sound, blending different cultures, from British, to Irish, to even tribal.  This CD contains just an hour and 12 minutes of his 3 hours score he wrote for the Fellowship.  I'm hoping that they might release another CD with more music from movie.  Which would be a wonderful thing.  As for the origional songs from the books.  They wasnt done in the movie do to boring exposition and doesnt move the story along, the reason for non of those songs on the soundtrack, I have heard there are talks for doing a few tracks from songs and poems in the books which would also be great for a collection.  Overall, the score I think is an unexpected success for both Howard Shore and Lord of the Rings fans.  I hope this review is helpful for all.

It's annoying (to me) but it probably wouldn't be if you like that kind of stuff. They have all of the following genres in here: Punk, rock, ska, pop, alternative, disco, and just plain creepy stuff! Everything about it is catchy though. &quot;Just A Girl&quot; is a total rock chick tune that doesn't fail to show us that Gwen was seriously under-rated in the past. &quot;Spiderewebs&quot; is one of the creepy-yet-great songs. Someone like Christina Aguilera could NEVER pull it off with her endless chants of yeah yeah, which Gwen would never attempt, gladly. No Doubt's absolute best cut ever lies in &quot;Return Of Saturn&quot; though, &quot;DARK BLUE&quot; is the cut, which doesn't even seem like Gwen. Only a few more days till &quot;Rock Steady&quot; YOU ALL PSYCHED!? I Can't wait! Hope I helped!
0345308239|5.0|this was my first tuchman book and since then, i have been and remain a fan.<BR>tuchman has taken instances in history which are steeped in pre-conceived notion by myself (and the general public, i presume)and managed to surpize me every single chapter.<BR>this is history lessons at their greatest...insightful and relevant. because the march of folly does not end with the last chapter...it goes on daily all over our planet.<BR>tuchman has put her finger on what is probably the greatest folly of them all...civilization, for all its benefits is the cornerstone of folly and destruction...i don't know if she or any other reviewers would agree with me on this point, but...my personal review is just that...personal and subjective.<BR>if you have not read it yet...buy it now.

0345413377|5.0|I don't really know why i am even bothering to throw these stones of opinion into this already over-filled pool of reviews here. But for some reason i feel compelled to, because this is a book i just cannot forget. Even after reading it over a year ago now, i can still recall how brilliant it was, and how shatteringly sad. Still, after these short 13 months I still want to go up to people in book shops and scream at them to buy it. It's THAT good. I find myself wanting to tell everyone i meet about it. I've already made my mother read the entire trilogy, and she loved it. It is not often i read books again, but i know i shall this one (and the entire series). <br />I came to this stunning trilogy with low expectations. I don't generally read fantasy novels, or novels intended for younger readers. (even though i am one, currently at the tender age of 15) But i left with a richer life. That is not an exaggeration. I actually feel better within myself for reading this book. It is probably a feeling that stems out of knowing what i would have missed had i not read them. <br />These three great novels (for they are not mere books) deal with w wonderful myriad of issues. Religion being one. And he [Pullman] deals with them in a wonderful way. This book is a true education in philosophy, but it is writen such that you don't actually realise you're sitting the class. You're too wrapped up in the story to notice. <br />And what a story it is. The plot is relentless and captivating. There is something magic about it all. You are right there with Will and Lyra, feeling everything they feel, thinking everything they think, experiencing everything they experience. An example of his brilliany way of making you feel you ARE the characters is when Lyra and Will have to seperate from their daemons. As humans, we can't really comprehend the feelings and the emotions both the children, because we are incapable of feeling them, as we will never ever be in a similar situation. But Pullman's majesty is that you DO. You really feel for them. You're sad for them. Even though you cannot know what it feels like, Pullman's marvellous writing is able to MAKE you. <br />The characters in this story are wonderful. Pullman draws them with utter precision and skill, capturing their emotions and feelings perfectly. It's one of the books major strengths, it's all so accurate. You might think that a middle aged Oxford prof would have a little trouble being able to write about children and their feelings in a relistic way, but he doesn't. <br />Some people say that the emotional bond the two children form is a bit unrealistic, and that some of the feelings they have are a bit too mature. That, in short, is nonsense. Being only three years ago i well remember how i felt aw 12. At that age you are at your most emotionally susceptible period, so everything you feel is hightened. And to top that, these two kids have been through a lot of tough stuff, so it's no surprise they are experiencing what might be considered adult emotions, because they will have grown up very quickly, learning responsibility at a very young age and being much more emotionally mature. <br />And not only are those two characters, so are all the rest. Serafina, Mary, and Mrs Coulter (especially her). The whole book is populated with wonderful people and wonderful events which just keep it steaming ahead to it's powerful conclusion. And WHAT a conclusion!<br />This book was the first book i had ever read that made me cry. No, not cry, weep. I had never shed a tear upon reading a book in my whoel life, but with this one i did. And trust me, crying is not something a 15 year old male does at the drop of a hat. Especially this hard-hearted old sod. But this book was truly heartbreaking. I had about 150 pages to go, and i thought i would have a quick bath and read a bit whilst there. I only expected to read about 25 pages at most, I'm not one for having hugely lengthy baths. But i started, and i couldn't stop. <br />I lay there for three hours, until the water was freezing cold, but i didn't care. I read it slowly, and i savoured it. I concentrated on every single sentence, every single word. And i didnt get out until I had finished it. <br />And i had had no idea it was coming. It was completely an unexpected ending (for some people it will have been as clear as day how it was going to end, but i don't like to think about how things might end, because it spoils it) and when the ending finally did come, i was shattered. Tears were streaming down my face, and i couldn't believe what he'd done. I cursed him for ending it that way. And it stayed with me for ages. In fact, it is still with me. It is a book that i know i will never be able to forget, and this is a series no reader, of matter what genre, should pass by. <br />Comparisons to Harry Potter are many, but none of them actually tell the truth. They say &quot;as good as J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter&quot;, but many of them dare to state the reality. Which is that they are better. I have read the Harry Potter, and really liked them. And i have read these. Phillip Pullman surpassed Harry Potter in every way. They pale in comparison to his superior trilogy, his superior writing, his superior (and not repetative) plots, his brilliance. <br />I implore of you, please these books. Your lives will be a better thing for it. <br />This one of the few books which a five star rating of is a severe injustice. Ten would also be too small a number.<br />Buy it, please.
B00003CXV4|4.0|If you like sad movies then this is the best one yet. Not only is it one of the saddest movies I've ever seen but also one of the best. It has a little comedy in it and it it almost reminds me of Dharma &amp; Greg except for this is a much more realistic, emotional version. Charlize Theron is fantastic but I dont think Keanu Reeves and her really match up. But, in other matters this is a must-see for anyone who has a tissue box on hand.
0345308239|5.0|This is a fascinating, useful, insightful book. Tuchman shows us how political leaders over the millenia have consistenly made decisions that were not in their own interest, even though they had the option to do otherwise.  I couldn't help but relate it to poor, self destructive decisions that organizations make, hurting themselves when they don't have to.  Tuchman didn't write a business book - she wrote a fabulous history book - but it gave me more business insights than any business book I've read in a long time.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|This movie has to be one of the most overated movie's ever .Like someone pointed out earlier Myers Diaz Lithgow and Murray were just doing the same charecter from other movies (Especially Murray heck i have seen the same sidekick thing in a dozen disney movies over the last 10 years ).I know making pop culture references is funny to most people but I myself think it's cheap jokes along with all the cheap fart and poop jokes .I came into this movie thinking I would see a great movie as I had been told by masses boy was I wrong .The only reason this gets 2 stars is because of all the extra specials features
B00003CY0V|1.0|Utter tripe.  Glossy, noisy tripe... but still tripe.  As so many have said here... you already know it's stupid, but it might even  have been worse.  I actually watched the alternate endings (God help me) and believe me, the ending they went with was the best of the bunch and that's not saying much.<br />Halle Berry has a very nice body which you will get to see most of, briefly.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I'm new to DVD's.  I LOVE IT!!  This movie was one of my first purchases.  The picture is beautiful!  The colors are vibrant &amp; the sound is unbelieveable!!  The best edition of Snow White Disney has put out.  The special features are great too.  Can't wait to try another Disney DVD!  But which one to pick???
B00003CXTG|4.0|I just finished watching this movie.  It was really great.  Granted the movie was more of a love story than a war movie, but it gave you a different look at how people felt about the war and people they loved risking their lives to protect and defend our county.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.  I plan on buying for myself.
0385505833|3.0|Skipping Christmas is a decent enough novella, yet after Mr. Grishams novel &quot;A Painted House&quot;, I was expecting something more.<br />The story revolves around the Kranks, a typical suburban family going through some growing pains. Their daughter has suddenly joined the peace corps., and they will be spending thier first Christmas without her. Mr. Krank, who figures that the family spent 6,000 dollars on gifts the year before on useless gifts, food and holiday donations, has a Scroogeian epiphany. With the progeny away, why pay for a holiday that has lost its meaning in over-priced gifts, cartoon sentiment and Faux cheer.<br />  Armed with this indisputable logic, Luther Krank convinces his wife to skip the holiday and spend the time pampering themselves on a luxury cruise. Sounds simple enough, yet unforeseen complications repeatedly spring up, causing consternation and doubt. Seems friends, family and neighbors can not fathom what the Kranks are about, and set about trying to convince the beleagured couple the errors of thier heathen ways.<br />  The story has its moments, an unbelieveable cast of neighbors who seem punch drunk on egg nog being one, and makes some very good points. The holiday is lost in sales and commercialized sentiment, and Grisham has a very neat handle on reasons why this is. Every person who has weathered holiday crowds, dealt with third cousins twice removed, and paid credit card bills, has dreamt about skipping Christmas. Yet the lead protagonists character is, at times, so crumdgeonly that despite his well thought reasons to bypass the winter event, you cannot seem to agree with his miserly tangents. In addition to that foible, he is also mean towards his wife. he brow beats her into his way of thinking and ignites if she disagrees.<br />  In turn, she goes from meek, to mean, to undecided and back again. In fact the only reason this novel didn't reaonate with me as much as I hoped it wouls, is because of The Kranks. is this book worth the price? Yes. It is a decent departure for Mr. Grisham, and a semi-amusing read.is book worth the price? Yes. It is a decent departure for Mr. Grisham, and a semi-amusing read.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I love Diana Krall but have to say this was a let down. I'm sure the other reviewer have already given their comments so I'll spare you. For those new to Krall or deciding on which album to get, I recommend some of her earlier works. My personal favs are the All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio and Love Scenes albums.
0380778556|5.0|And you thought you had problems. Our never-named narrator marries a millionaire twice her age, and moves back to her husband's estate, Manderley, on the coast of Cornwall, England. Soon her husband's now dead first wife, Rebecca, whose body was never discovered, begins to invisibly invade the newlyweds. If that's not enough, add Mrs. Danvers, the all-seeing housekeeper who yearns to have the original first lady of the house back in charge, and a mysterious man who surprises our narrator at every turn and you've got what you paid for: A terrific page-turning mystery. Rebecca is du Maurier at her very best, which is why, 60 years after its first publication, Rebecca continues to deliver mystery and intrigue to her readers and why annually thousands visit Cornwall, in search of Manderley. You'll read this book more than once and each time you do, you'll appreciate the evocative and intriguing way du Maurier lures you into Manderley's mysterious world.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|If you are going to buy this CD, make sure you look for the &quot;limited edition&quot;, it has an additional CD included that is excellent and doesn't cost any more.
6305047529|5.0|First of all, the quality of the print on this DVD is fantastic !<BR>Yes, there is a difference !<br />As for the movie, this performance, along with The Court Jester and Knock on Wood (not on DVD or VHS yet) is a real Danny Kaye masterpiece !  Amusing, heart-warming and entertaining.<br />A must for every Kaye-fan !
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is great.  I think it got a lot of bad press because people didn't realize that the main focus is on the characters lives at the time of the attack.  Yes, the movie is called &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, so it seems like it should be on just the attack itself, but these days, you have to have identifiable characters.  As far as the war aspect of the movie, it is dead on.  Except for two small parts.(I won't list them just in case you haven't seen the movie).  And, anyone who liked &quot;Titanic&quot;  can say nothing against the love story in this movie.  In closing, definitely see this movie and decide for yourself.  As for me, I loved it!
B00004Z4WR|3.0|I'm sick of reading poor reviews of this movie, if you don't expect anything from it, you'll love it! (Assuming that you enjoy classic cars, plenty of action, and basically, just action.. as well as some comic remarks).  Just don't think about the plot or poor character development, and enjoy the excellent action scenes.  It's a no-commitment movie you can watch over and over, that will certainly excite you!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is fantastic. The first time you watch it, you will more than likely be confused. But every time you watch it, you will notice little things that make it so much better. (13 times, & still improving).<br />It's got some good points, about money controlling your life. \\"You are not the contents of your wallet. You are not the car you drive. You are not your ...khakis. You have to give up, and realize that one day you WILL die. Until then you are useless.\\"<br />If you only saw the previews, I recommend you watch this. The previews did it no justice. Because of the way the plot is written, it is nearly impossible to make a good preview. I originally saw the movie only because of Edward Norton, who in my opinion is an outstanding actor, but afterwards, I was incredibly pleased with the result.
B000001ELP|2.0|The boys went out on a limb with this one.  In my opinion this was less of a KISS album and more of a producer exerting too much<br />influence...It happens.  I do like a few of the tracks though you will probably never hear them again.  &quot;I&quot; was good, and of course, &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;.  They ventured too far from what made them great during the 80's but they figured it out and came back from the brink.  This is one that is kept purely for historical record by the hardcore fan.
0451203933|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work.  You are literally transported to MOG with the Rangers and I actually felt my blood pressure going up as &quot;we&quot; fought our way through the night.  This book gave me, a non-military type, some insight into this horrific battle and the politics and dynamics surrounding our involvement there.<br />I look forward to reading Mr. Bowden's other work.
B000000W5M|5.0|incredible music...the whole album is good...they don't make music like this anymore...all thats out here today is kiddie rock...even todays country music is garbage....they are censoring music again...sort of like they did in the 60's,but most people are on to them...(the big record companies)...the stones are a part a life for real people...not censored people...thnx.happy holidays
B00003CXRM|2.0|Gotta tell ya, this SHOULD have been a great movie, all of the ingredients were top shelf, it just didn't jell.  Thankfully someone lent me their copy (to save me the $22) and told me that they hated it, boy were they right.  It wasn't funny very often, it was slow, it was boring, and worst of all at the end I was sitting wondering what the hell the point of the whole thing was, dumb!<br />Rent this one if you must subject yourself to it, it is NOT worth owning unless you or your uncle were in it and just want to show friends that you were in a movie with Clooney.
B000002UAO|4.0|Perhaps &quot;Michelle&quot;, and &quot;In My Life&quot; are the only two immortals on RUBBER SOUL. They may be the quintessential ballad sounds of Paul and John, respectively. The other ballads here &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot;, and &quot;It's Only Love&quot; are mainly John's efforts,and really don't hold their own against the band's (usually Paul's) very best. They still seem simple and (yes) a little adolescent,after 35 years. &quot;You Won't see Me&quot; (Paul), and &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; (George) have a surprisingly similar feel,and are among the fellow's neglected gems. &quot;I'm Looking Through You &quot; is 3rd-rate Paul,with an organ accompaniment that could be from the old TV show &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. &quot;Wait&quot; is good enough, with nice buildup in the middle. &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; is John at his misogynist worst (&quot;I'd rather see you dead little girl than to be with another man&quot;) Simply a bad song.But,no doubt if this were any other rock band's entry,it would without question be a Five-Star. REVOLVER, SGT PEPPER,AND ABBEY ROAD are all unquestionably better!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|so far we have <BR>5 stars:45<BR>4 stars:30<BR>3 stars:8<BR>2 stars:2<BR>1 star:11<br />its obvious what kind of people didnt like this cd.
B000002UDB|5.0|Yes, I bought this album,and some of the original 45's, ages ago,and time does not wear as well here as on REVOLVER and PEPPER,especially the former. Every song does have a pop bubble gum feel,though I still get some fun from &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;,&quot;All You Need is Love&quot;, Penny Lane&quot;, and &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;. &quot;Penny&quot;'s dance hall sound is unique in John's reportoire,the lyrics here are still outstanding and a touch eccentric,and the trumpet solo is among the best ever! &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; once again shows Paul in tip top shape with  real old time humor, in another old dance hall sounding number.&quot;Walrus&quot; is still hard to make head or tail of,but the orchestration and opening cellos are worth a listen.As for the rest, well it's best not to comment. The cover art etc. is way below Pepper, as is the overall concept.Despite the general lack of cohesion, still a classic Beatles album,which makes it an all-time pop classic.
0385505833|5.0|I have just finished &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, and must say I found this book absolutely hilarious. This is definitely one book not to be skipped.<br />I totally identified with Luther Krank, as I too (and I am sure many of you) have felt like skipping Christmas at one time or another.<br />As Luther proceeds with his plan to skip the festivities and instead go on a Caribbean cruise, he reluctantly gets the cooperation of his wife Nora, but his nosy neighbours on Hemlock Street have other ideas which sabotages his plans.Then when Blair, his daughter, announces she is coming home for the holidays,the craziness takes a different twist.<br />This is a good lighthearted read, throwing a comical spin on the madness of the holidays.<br />Highly recommended. Give yourself and friends this book for Christmas.
B000002UAU|5.0|But for this reviewer to give a 5-star to any rock album means,it has stood the test of time, or (if newer) should!! The cover still makes for some interesting discussion,and  is maybe even more unique than the songs.This is also the first album with all the lyrics published, so that there would no debates among fans as to what they actually were. Truly a terrific art design!! Here Goes:  SGT PEPPER is a nice intro even if the almost shouting vocal and loud brasses become a little mind-numbing over the years..HELP FROM MY FRIENDS a perfect piece of fun with Ringo at his humorous top..LUCY a song that shows,for all it's originality at the time,that the Beatles' sometimes missed the spot. An update of Lewis Carroll's Alice it is not,and the &quot;LUCY in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; choral vocal is another headache maker...&quot;Getting Better&quot; a slight improvement, some good fun but does not age well...&quot;Fixing a hole&quot;  a great improvement over &quot;Better&quot;...&quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;  simply an all-time great song telling a beautifully sad story that will mean something,and sound fine in 100 years...MR KITE shows John at his eccentric best,a one of a kind number about a circus-like carnival. How can you not love it?!..(SIDE 2) WITHIN YOU... Strange,but inspired tune by the &quot;Quiet Beatle&quot; truly a new sound at the time,which in it's genre may never be matched...&quot;Sixty Four&quot; again displays Paul's one of a kind ability to look at long-past (vaudeville) sounds,freshing them up,with his personal charm and fun... &quot;Good Morning&quot;..a weaker track. For a better song, listen to the same title from the old classic musical &quot;Singin in the Rain&quot; with Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly!..&quot;Lovely Rita&quot; a silly Paul song that shows him at his whimsical best...&quot;Sgt Peppers&quot; reprise,skip it if you can. &quot;Day in the Life&quot; shows all of John's bizarre musical genius,a real showcase,and maybe even a mind trip of one kind or another!!
B00005OWEG|5.0|Seen in the theater on Dec. 9th, 2001<br />I came to Apocalypse Now with no expectations other than some faint knowledge about its subject matter - the Vietnam `Conflict' - and the merest smattering of its controversial making, in that Coppola supposedly went half-insane during its production.  People around me had proclaimed the original cut as genius...but genius, as I have discovered over the years, is really in the eye of the beholder.  Thanks to the mass-media machine, mediocrity and flat-out travesties are often trumped up as more than they seem via technical proficiency, big explosions, big-dollar names, and other such glitter-and-fade tactics: pretty on the surface with no soul or synapse challenge beneath.<br />Not so with Apocalypse Now (redux).  Imagine my surprise to discover, halfway through this devastating film, that I was watching a modern interpretation of Joseph Conrad's novella masterpiece Heart of Darkness (Kurtz gave it away... Kurtz, Kurtz, a madman enchanted and in agony...).  The journey up the river is slow, tortuous, and full of import, but instead of colonial Africa, Coppola takes us into the madness of war-torn Vietnam.  From Kilgore's \\"surf's up\\" mania to the simmering resentments at the French Plantation; from the casual butchery of a Vietcong village to the grasping, half-incoherent blips of lust and gratification via opium and Playboy Bunnies (the adult Barbie industry; exploitation made palatable) - Vietnam (and in that, the darkness of the human soul) is seen, captured, exposed through Martin Sheen's murderously world-weary gaze; despite his cynic experience, he is shaken to the core, as are we, the jaded audience.<br />From a technical standpoint, Apocalypse Now is sheer brilliance.  Acting, cinematography, editing, sound, use of color, dialogue, juxtaposition of the light and dark - all contribute to the overall build of tension, one that precisely mirrors Conrad's own literary achievement.  Not a moment of 16mm is wasted, no scene overlong or overly-portentous, the flaw of other Vietnam movies (Stone's Platoon in particular).  I wonder about what was cut in the original, but ultimately I don't care, nor wish to see the butchered version - redux, in all its harrowing glory, is incredible material, well worth the time invested.<br />This is not casual entertainment in which to waste brain cells - this is a bleak, visceral force, artistic expression as grave and conflicted as its subject matter.  One for the archives.
B00005R87Q|3.0|This is one of those great horrible movies.  In four or five years, this will be on TNT or TBS &quot;Movies for Guys Who Love Movies&quot; repeating 3 times a week.  As with other awesome terrible movies, this has redeeming factors.  Certainly not the acting, though Vin Diesel does a decent job, above everyone else's phone-in of the dialogue.  The music, race scenes and cinematography are pretty well done.  <br />Basically, you have to determine what your mindset is prior to viewing.  I went in knowing that this was no Citizen Kane, and had a blast.  Other people in the theater thought it was legitimate cinema, not eye candy, and were really disappointed.  I'm rating it 3-stars, but if you want a low-impact fun movie, to &quot;let the art flow over you&quot;, this is the one.<br />The interesting thing is that this is a repeat of another movie.  I realized this a half-hour into it, and proceeded to exclaim aloud during a midnight showing.  (Side note:  The only reason I was there was that a transformer blew and it was August in Phoenix.  So I had to seek refuge in a cool place until repairs were made.)  I did not regret seeing the film - it was eye candy.  Though I had to watch my speed on the drive home in my own &quot;rice wagon&quot;.<br />One other reviewer got it right.  It's Point Break!  Take the script for the other thespian (Keanu Reeves, not Paul Walker), do a find-and-replace on &quot;surf&quot;, &quot;bank robbery&quot;, and &quot;FBI&quot;, and replace them with &quot;cars&quot;, &quot;cargo hijacking&quot;, and &quot;LAPD&quot;, and you get the EXACT same movie.  They're so similar, it's eerie.<br />Once I get the DVD, I'm going to put the Point Break VHS in and listen to that audio with the F&amp;F video feed and see if they match.  I can see it now.  Paul Walker confronting Vin Diesel, with Keanu's voice (as he reproaches Patrick Swayze)&quot;You got greedy!  And it went bad!&quot;  The only difference is that we know Johnny Utah is in the FBI first,then he's a wannabe surfer; where Brian O'Conner is a wannabe racer, THEN we learn he's LAPD.  That's probably enough to avoid a lawsuit.  <br />The editorial review compared it to &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;.  Come on.  There are no Oscars in this film.  Others have compared it to Gone in 60 Seconds, which was a bad terrible movie, one in which Oscar-winners (Cage, Jolie, Duvall) obviously had some bills to pay.  Also, American Graffiti was a classic coming-of-age character study, with the car culture (in a different valley - the San Joaquin) as a backdrop only.  Though Graffiti was equally endearing, it was for different reasons.<br />F&amp;F was a fun movie - just start it with no expectations, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Let me start out by saying that this is the first album of Shakira's that I've bought, and the first time I even heard of her existance was about 2 weeks ago when I saw her on the top 20 countdown on VH1 (#17).  Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, who appear to be upset for the most part about her crossing over to English, I love the album (except tracks 8 and 10, which I by-pass when listening to the CD, since I don't speak a lick of Spanish).  For someone who has crossed over, I can see including tracks 12 and 13, which are Spanish versions of Tracks 3 and 1 (The best tracks on the CD) respectively, but as mentioned above, if the intent is to cross over to English, tracks 8 and 10 could be done without.  Of the 9 tracks in English, 8 of the 9 songs are excellent (The one exception being track 9 \\"Poem of a Horse\\").  This is not Enrique Iglesias, or Carlos Santana, this is a Spanish woman than can actually sing in English, and a must-buy album to add to your collection.  If she continues to go this route, I see Shakira being a big success in the United States.  Of course, if she goes back to creating Spanish albums, I guess this will just be a 1-time affair.<br />(...)
B00003CXDD|4.0|The movie itself is pretty good, although it starts off REALLY unevenly.  When I watched it the other day, I was really surprised by that (of course, as a kid, I wouldn't have noticed).  Not too mention, is it just me, or do Sorsha's motivations just seem to come out of the clear blue sky?  They should have gone at least two seconds into that.  But I'm not going to get too much into the film because there's hordes of other reviews about just that here.  But what does the DVD version have to offer?<br />To start off, the anamorphic transfer is really well done.  The picture's really nice and I didn't catch any flaws with it.  There's also a pretty good commentary by Warwick Davis on there, although another reviewer was right, it would have been nice to hear some input from Ron Howard or George Lucas thrown in there.  The trailers are funny to watch (ah, the evolution of marketing in the movie business), but the &quot;making of&quot; is mostly a throwaway piece, something you'd expect a trimmed down version of on some pay cable station immediately after the movie.<br />The &quot;Morf to Morphing&quot; piece is pretty interesting if you're into either the history of special effects or a brief look at how much work went into developing the morphing technology.  There's also a hidden documentary in the trailers section that deals specifically with Raziel's transformation.  Keep in mind, this piece was produced by ILM for ILM, and it very much so comes across as that.  Most of what you see here is at least touched on in the &quot;Morf to Morphing&quot; bit, with most of the interviews lifted directly from this (although they do go just a slight bit more into the technology aspect of it).<br />All in all, good little DVD package.  The sound is good, like the menus, worth the purchase if you like the movie.
B00000BKE0|3.0|I know that I will propably catch alot of heat from fellow Iron Maiden fans for saying this, but when listening through No Prayer for the Dying the words uninspired and dull comes to mind. It is like Iron Maiden lost some of their creativity and their &quot;energy&quot; on this album. There are some good songs like the title track and Run Silent, Run Deep but as a whole the album seem &quot;forced&quot; by that I mean it seems like Iron Maidens soul was not into making this album, like it was something they had to do to satisfy record companies or fans. They might succeed in pleasing the first group, but I do think they fail in making the second party happy. <BR>Bruce Dickinson left Iron Maiden after this album, and one have to wonder whether he was getting tired of &quot;playing it safe&quot; and wanted new challenges as a solo-artist. <BR>With Dickinson leaving Iron Maiden went towards sad times.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Station to Station is 2nd only to Scary Monsters, in my extremely large Bowie collection. This album boasts brilliant lyrics, danceable music, fantastic emotional singing, mood swings of all sorts and 30 minutes of history's greatest, at his best. The songs mix soul, rock, and everyting wiht dark humor. The album doesn't let on how dark it really is. The title track, is by far bowie's best song, and the other 5 are in the top 15. If you buy this album with an open mind, then you won't regret it. It is 6 songs of brilliance, a true masterpiece.
B00000BKDY|5.0|This album reveals alot of change. First of all Iron Maiden now introduces synthesizers!!! That was not something you heard every day on your average metal album at the time, and some fans strongly disaproved. The sound changed too, fitting the sci-fi theme of the Cd. I still see this Cd as one of their better, the change seems refreshing and you can still recognize the Maiden fingerprints on most of the songs. Caught Somewhere in Time is a brilliant introduction to this cd, starting off to show us a new sound. The songs in some way seem more serious than on previous albums(noone in their right state of mind can take a song like Number of the Beast serious), and again it also touches spiritual aspects(De Ja Vu), and once again Harris dabbles in history on Alexander the Great. This album is a great example of how diverse Iron Maiden can be when they put their mind up to it.
B000002J0B|5.0|this my fav. zeppelin album.it has a little bit of raggea,rock,do-wop,funk.the song remains the same is a classic song.the rain song is one of their best soft songs.over the hills and far away is a great tune.the crunge is aight.not there best stuff.dancing days has a killer sound.dy'er ma'ker is not bad it could get better.no quarter id to dark but itz good.the ocean is madd cool with a great ending.
B00000BKDW|4.0|Iron Maiden continued much in the same vein as Piece of Mind, Maiden still mess around alot in different genres, and this album also give us some instant classics like 2 Minutes to Midnight, Aces High and the epic Rime of the Ancient Mariner. <BR>As a whole the album seems wellmade, and solid. There is not much new under the sun though, but why change something you know is working like a charm? The album is classic Iron Maiden, strong, powerful riffs and alot of guitar-rock.
B000002J03|5.0|this album is another one of my favorite albums.black dog is a great rock n roll.rock n roll is there best song.well?battle of evermore is pretty cool.misty mountain top is kool too.four sticks i dont like.stairway to heaven is a classic song.ging to california sounds like a 60's song.when the levee is a great hard rock song
B00000BKDX|5.0|The release of this live album showed what Iron Maiden was really about. This is in my opinion the best live album with Iron Maiden ever, and one of the best live albums, by any band ever. This was recorded back when Iron Maiden were THE guys in heavy metal, they stood second to none, and this album truly catches their spirit alive. <BR>The selection of tracks is a near perfect, it gives a great idea of the spectrum of their production(at that point) and most of their classics are there, including unbeatable versions of Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Hallowed Be Thy Name, both actualy much better than the studio recordings. What really makes this album is the feel of the audience, you can tell that Iron Maiden really got them involved and that both parts thinks this is a blast. That is the way concerts are supposed to be. Bruce is not singing to TO the audience he is singing FOR them.<BR>Even though this is a live album and thus does not offer up any new tracks I would still consider it one of the finest Iron Maiden albums of all time, and a landmark for heavy metal in the 80's,
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is probably one of the greatest books ever written.  The novel is morally fantastic.  The novel is about a family that lives in the south in a community that is dealing with a controversial racial issue.  Scout and Jem are young kids that learn valuable lessons while they are growing up.  They know that all people should be created equal. For instance, Scout ventures to a black church and does not think anything about it. Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem's father, represents a black man that has been charged with rape.  Clearly, the black man is innocent, and Atticus Finch wants to do the right thing.  In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful book that is full of great moral examples that people should follow.  One of the highlights of the book is Atticus Finch saying, &quot;Before you say anything bad about someone, walk a mile in their shoes.&quot;
B00000BKDV|4.0|The 1983 release from Iron Maiden, Piece of Mind showed a much better production than Number of the Beast, but lyricaly and musicaly it stayed in the same vein. The songs still revolved around themes picked up from movies and books, and Iron Maiden covers a wide range of subjects from war(The Trooper) to ancient history(Quest For Fire) to old world war II movies(Where Eagles Dare). <BR>Sometimes one get the feeling that the frequency of Iron Maiden albums, depend on how much time Steve Harris can spend going to the movies or reading books. The album is great though, containing everything that metal from the 80's are supposed to, fast chords, fast singing and ALOT of guitar solos. If you liked Number of the Beast, I would call it a safe be that you will enjoy Piece of Mind as well.
B000002A3T|4.0|I have to disgree with a lot of what i hear about pink floyd. I have heard the post waters line up refferd to as a glorified tribute band. First off, considering it includes pink floyd's superb guitarist, the only truly great vocalist the band has ever had, the co writer of most of the classic tracks, and also the keyboard player and drummer, i find that stance kind of hard to argue. Waters played bass, gave us a few vocals (nd which vocals do you prefer, Money or Fletcher Memorial Home?!), and shoved in over complicating and often morally questionable conceptual themes to music that, let's face it, was built around the guitar sound. The guitar is the premier instrument in most rock bands and floyd is no exception. On most tracks its the undoubted highlight, witness Comfortably numb, Money, Shine On...<BR> So, here we have a slightly stripped down pink floyd producing a bunch  of largely quality pieces. Apart from Take it back, the most single-like song of the floyd's catalogue, this album is drenched in atmosphere, from the superb minimalist opener, through to the excelent What Do You Want From Me, the most guitar driven of the tracks, through to the haunting harmonics of Marooned, to the powerful closer. Not every track is a classic (those i've mentioned are ), but they are consistenly good, if with slightly less soaring guitar work than i would have liked form a Pink Floyd unshackelled from the Waters drag factor. This was the first floyd album i heard, and although since having gone back through the catalogue, i'd say the waters era was better, this is not necessarily all due to Waters own influence. Great though a band is, it can't make each album better than the last, and we would all have a better time and lower blood pressure if we were willing to enjoy what quality work they do produce rather than growing hoarse with moaning that they are passed their best.As to complaints that the inclusion of broad conceptual social themes is motivated by Waters-compensation, i have to ask, what do you expect Floyd to write about? They've always been a serious band, that atmosphere is the key element to their sound. You expect them to become  a party band in a desperate bid for originality? They're doing what they do best, and this may not be there best album but that hardly makes it deplorable. Give 'em a break. To the rest of you, go buy it if you like classic floyd. It's a good record.
B000006JPJ|5.0|Seventh Son of a Seven Son seems to have always been underrated especially by Iron Maiden fans. There are a lot of reasons why this album should not measure up to albums like &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; or &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;...and they all fall flat!<BR>I feel that this album is propably Iron Maidens most harmonic effort so far, by that not saying it is the best. The album have an occult/supernatural theme that it keeps all the way through. All the songs seem to revolve around mysticism and the occult, which give great contiunity. The sound is different from their previous albums though, and that might be what a lot of fans dislike, metal-fans never been too happy about changes. I find the new sound refreshing though, and Iron Maiden seem to be at their best, both lyricaly and musicaly. The extra emphasis on keyboards might scare some fans too. <BR>I truly enjoy the &quot;theme&quot; of the album, I find it entertaining with a subject for an album, almost like Bruce Dickinsons solo-album The Chemical Wedding. All the tracks seem wellcrafted and wellproduced and very maidensk. There is nothing wrong with this album.
6305013578|2.0|I regret two things: 1- prior to my purchase not reading other user reviews which stated about the poor recording quality of the DVD, 2- rating such a masterpiece 2 stars only because of its poor quality.<br />I agree with all the other people who commented on the unacceptable quality of the image you get. It is out of focus, crops the sides of the frame (I guess that one can see not more than the 70% of the whole frame area) and sctatchy. Producing and marketing such a DVD is a sheer disrespect to a masterpiece like Metropolis.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|With Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith re-joining Iron Maiden, things are looking brighter for them. And yes, Brave New World is their best album since Seventh Son of a Seventh son. <BR>When you listen to Brave New World it is like returning to the earlier albums, a return to another time, and there is nothing wrong with that! Iron Maiden seem more vital and alive than ever on this album, it seems that Dickinsons 6 year absence gave him new blood and new life, and that the return of himself and Smith gave Iron Maiden a new lease on life. <BR>The album does not contain any instant Maiden classics, but it certainly contain &quot;classic&quot; Maiden. This album proves to be a longlasting one, and it grows on you. At first I found the album mediocre but after listening through it some times, every song began to grow on me, and some songs like Dream of Mirrors and Out of the Silent Planet almost became new Maiden classics for me. As did the fantastic Blood Brothers, the song Metallica have been trying to write for a decade now, but failed to.<BR>The album and the band seem in harmony, they all seem to work together and to enjoy themself again. Welcome back Iron Maiden!
6304806442|5.0|This is a great movie. Well worth keeping you will laugh, cry, laugh, cry all through it. A truly great performance from Ewan Mcgregor. If you ever go to Scotland you will find characters like this.
B00000BKE1|3.0|Iron Maidens 1992 release Fear of the Dark, seems a stronger album than the lowpoint, No Prayer for the Dying, but it still seems like there is something lacking, although it is hard to say what. It is still Iron Maiden, the sound is (somewhat) the same, the lyrical content haven't changed much...and still.<BR>The album does have its bright sides like the title track that is one of those Iron Maiden instant classics, and like one of those few serious songs, Afraid to Shoot Strangers. But to be honest I do not feel that the rest of the songs rise up to Iron Maidens usual standards. Dickinson left the band to try a career alone after this album, untill his return for Brave New World, maybe it tells us that he was tired of the &quot;safety&quot; in Iron Maiden and wanted to bet on the wildcards? The time away most certainly was wellspend.
B00005AFMT|5.0|This is one of King Crimson's finest works. It is certainly more focused than anything before it and nothing since then has quite hit the nail on the head the way &quot;Discipline&quot; does. My only minor complaint is that it's a bit too short, clocking in at less than 38 minutes. Listening to this recording is like looking at an M.C. Escher sketch with your ears! You have to focus beyond what is obvious to get the full hypnotic effect. &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; is in my top five favorites from this band. The guitar work is like nothing I've ever heard before or since.  Tony Levin is probably the greatest bassist since Jaco Pastorius, and there just are not enough superlatives for the drumming of Bill Bruford.<BR> This album propelled King Crimson into the 80's. It has an 80's feel to it, but still sounds fresh 20 years later. One can't deny the obvious Talking Heads influence. That has much to do with the fact that Adrian Belew had just left a stint as an extended member of that band. Fripp himself had also contributed on the Heads' &quot;Fear Of Music&quot; in 79, so it's fair to say that both bands were an influence on each other. There is also an undeniable similarity between the voices of Belew and Byrne, though Belew is a much better singer. One listen to the beautifull &quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; is proof of that, and this new remastered version also contains a second version of that piece that was originally on the vinyl editon, containing an addtional guitar track from Mr fripp.  <br />This has all the elements that make up King Crimson at their best. Hard dissonance countered by other pieces that are soothing. This type of contrast is an element that has been somewhat lacking on later releases, though they still provide us with some of the most creative and challenging listening in rock music.
0385505833|1.0|An uninteresting, bigoted, rich and superficial couple has the first interesting idea of their lives and this book follows their complete inability to recognize it or follow-through.  I was apalled with these characters, and actually read through the entire book hoping to find out that Grisham had somehow addressed their inexcusable traits--No luck.<br />The premise is interesting--a couple wants to forego the commercialism of christmas.  If only the people were anywhere near as interesting as that idea.  Its almost as if without shopping and hobnobbing they don't have anything left to do.<br />From its gross portrayal of a 'middle-class' family who barely blinks at wasting thousands of dollars on something they'll never use, to a mother and father whose racism shows brightly on Christmas Eve, this book deserves only one place on your Christmas morning--in the fire.
B00003CXB2|5.0|David Lean's Bridge On the River Kwai is said to be his best work...not in my opinion, it's second to this epic masterpiece.<br />His wide span of the camera over deserts and mountains in this film is breathtaking. His characters become remarkable by the end. But most of all, the film's narrative study of the title character is sumptuous of all...bravo bravo.<br />O'Toole, Sharif, and Quinn gives career making performances...not to mention performances that would bring about Oscars. <br />And like Gone With the Wind, Ben Hur and Titanic...this film deserved many Oscars and nominations for Oscars. And like those three other masterful epics, this is a film that will stand the test of time.<br />Again, bravo bravo bravo!
0441172717|5.0|Frank Herbet's Dune is perhaps the best science fiction/fantasy novel that I have ever read. Once you read the first few pages you are hooked! I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi. Also try ALL his other books they are great too!
0792151712|5.0|It's simply the best film of the 90s. It's simply the greatest disaster film in history. It has enduring characters. A sumptuous plot. Lovable music. Beautiful cinematography. AND a well written script...on the contrary, a BAD script is more like that of Gone in 60 Seconds or Battlefield Earth... <br />This movie will fill you full of joy, inject you with a passion for two likable characters, Jack and Rose, and rewards you will some of the most realistic (not to mention) effect scenes in film history (Titanic's sinking). Be that as it may, you'll be at awe with shock or fear for Jack and Rose...then, comes sheer sadness. Overwhelming emotions that would be difficult to find any other movie.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Both adults and kids will be entertained for hours with this outstanding DVD, that has two discs full of extras, and the movie is an experience of it's own, with the highly entertaining story about a ogre, a talking donkey, and a beautyful princess that is going out on a unforgettable adventure, with many parodies on the Gingerbread Man, Snow White and much more!<br />I can't wait for the Special Editions, and I hope that 'Shrek' will be nominated for both 'Best Picture', and 'Best Animated Movie' under the next years 'Academy Awards'.
0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson's book is a very interesting mix of humor and travel writing that does a fairly good job of covering the subject of Australia and what may be found there. I enjoyed the nice touches that other writers might have missed (i.e. the atomic bomb that may have gone off in the outback, the crocodile named &quot;Sweetheart&quot;, etc.). I also enjoy his frequently funny observations about the people he met while there.<br />My only real criticism is that Bryson has a juvenile fascination with bathroom humor which repeatedly injects itself into his writing. Bryson does need to grow up a bit. But on the whole, it was an enjoyable read.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I am a total Britney Spears fans, and I have to say this is a VERY good combat for the Pop Princess. I have both of her previous albums - \\"Baby\\" and \\"Ooops\\" - and I have to just say that \\"Britney\\" is the best. Songs like \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" which is an ultimate dance song, \\"Boys\\" and get down and dirty song (Love it!), \\"Overprotected\\" Love the beat and lyrics, \\"Let Me Be\\" another dance song, has a different kind of sound. \\"Bombastic Love\\" and \\"I Love Rock 'n' Rock\\" are both hardcore get up and jump around kind of dance songs. <br />I could go on and on with this list. If you are a Britney fan (or even a Britney-hater) you have to try this one out BEFORE judging. <br />(...)
B000002KHH|5.0|When I had puchased this album I was in a trance state at &quot;Planet Caravan.&quot; And felt unusually close to &quot;Paranoid.&quot; &quot;War Pigs/Luke's Wall&quot; is a great classic to a Vietnam theme. The reason being is that I later learned after purchasing this album was about Vietnam. Each song correspondes to that war. War pigs are the politics who started it. Nixon is the &quot;Iron Man.&quot; This can be easly heard in &quot;Hand of Doom.&quot;
B00004VWAF|1.0|Among today's practitioners of sampling and electronic music, Miles Davis' &quot;On The Corner&quot; is generally accorded reverential status as being a kindred precursor. &quot;Herbie Hancock &amp; The Headhunters&quot;, recorded just a year after &quot;On The Corner&quot;, is a much more musically and conceptionally realized offshoot. As Herbie Hancock made clear in the Headhunters' liner notes, Miles Davis didn't give his musicians any scales to work from. Thus, &quot;On The Corner&quot; is little more than heavily edited, random noises
B000002KDO|5.0|Once I had listened to this album I was in awe to the heavy rifts and amazing vocals. With the sweet sounds of &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; to the soft, meaningful &quot;Solitude.&quot;
B00003CXTF|5.0|I have read everyone's negative reviews and I don't know what movie they saw!  Pearl Harbor was not another Titanic, it was 50,000 times better.  I thought Ben Affleck and Josh Haartnett did a great job.  The action sequences are amazing and this has become my #1 fav movie!!!!!!!!!
B00005NWRS|4.0|Most of the reviews that I've heard or read about this album talk about how Adams is imitating other artists with his music. Although I have to admit that &quot;Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues&quot; sounds like Neil Young. And &quot;Answering Bell&quot; sounds a lot like Van Morrison&quot;. But even Van the Man sounds at times like Jackie Wilson or Sonny Boy Williamson to me. My point to all this is, so what if he does sound a little like these guys? I can't think of better artists to base some music on than these legends. What makes this album work though, is not who sounds like who, but it's great songs. Elton John thinks Ryan Adams is a songwriting genius. That statement alone made me kind of leery to pick up this cd. But as it turns out, he may be ruh..ruh..right. There's plenty of material here to like. The opener &quot;New York, New York&quot; is a great organ driven rocker that really got my attention, because I was expecting a little more of his twangy sound left over from Adams Whiskeytown days. But for the most part, he's put his country rock sound to rest and gone to a more pop and rock sound here. &quot;Answering Bell&quot; is another song I like a lot. It's that Van Morrison sounding song that I think Van would be happy to call his own. It's one of those songs that should get a lot of airplay, at least in a perfect world it would. &quot;When The Stars Go Blue&quot; is by far the most beautiful song I've heard this year. Adams shows here what a good singer he is too. The only thing wrong with this album is that it's just too long. The first half of this is brilliant. But then it gets weighted down with some very generic sounding songs like the boring 9 minute workout of &quot;Nobody's Girl&quot;. Totally unnecessary, along with 4 or 5 other very average songs I could have done without. But he gets back on track again towards the end with the catchy rocker &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot;, and &quot;Touch, Feel, and Lose, and also the rockin' &quot;Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues&quot;. Adams gets back to his country roots with the limited edition 5 song ep second disc that comes with this album. Two songs I like a lot off this is the banjo driven &quot;Sweet Black Magic&quot;, which has kind of a Kentucky backporch country blues sound. And &quot;Cannonball Days&quot; which has a fast and catchy strumming acoustic guitar backed by an easy flowing organ. Nice stuff. I really liked most of this album. Adams just needs to learn to edit out some his mediocre music so I don't have to keep reaching for that darn skip button on the changer. Still, this is a cd that's well worth having just for it's moments of brilliance. Recommended.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you want have 2 hours of good time, you have to see this movie...
0385505833|1.0|I was enjoying this book as a light holiday read with a character who I and anyone else tired of the commercialism of Christmas can relate to.  I was enjoying it right until the end when the protagonist and his wife express their relief that their future son-in-law, though Peruvian, &quot;isn't that dark&quot;.  As a person of color I am more than double fed up with people thinking that it's just a-ok to look down on people like me.  Luther Krank after all he went through to regain his Christmas spirit, still proved himself to be a narrow minded bigot in the end.  Shame on John Grisham for even putting that ignorant thought in the book!  That bit of stupidity ruined an otherwise fun book for me and will definitely keep me from purchasing it as Christmas gifts for others as I had planned too.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India.Arie's debut album &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is incredible.  Easily comparable to Tracy Chapman, Inida.Arie blends soul music, r&amp;b, and folk.  Each song is catchy and well-written.  Along with the catchy tunes, India.Arie also delivers positive messages in each song.  Her first single, &quot;Video&quot; addresses image and self-loving.  The CD, is awesome, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good soul music.
0805062971|5.0|This book is amazing...if nothing else for its ability to stimulate and disturb you line after line.  As the narrator descends into madness, he rages against the consumer culture of the modern world so beautifully, that you will find yourself actually wanting to join him in his crusade for its destruction.  If nothing else, this book will make you think before you buy into all of those sly advertisements that bombard us daily...and make you shudder...wondering if someone like the narrator might be out there right now...plotting, enlisting, and preparing for a brave new world.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Driving Rain gets better each time I listen to the CD.The CD starts off strong with &quot;Lonely Road&quot; and &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot;.Paul made a mistake,he should have made &quot;Lonely Road&quot; the first single.&quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; is my least favorite track.The melody goes nowhere,like the edgy lyrics and subject matter.Quite different from the normal Paul songs.&quot;Driving Rain&quot; is catchy and upbeat(another single maybe ?).The 1,2,3,4,5 lyric does not bother me.Not ever song needs to be deep and thought provoking.&quot;Magic&quot; is one of my favorite tracks,like the guitar sound and the lyrics about Linda is nice.&quot;About You&quot; rocks and should be a real good concert song.&quot;Heather&quot; is a real breezy instrumental until the end.&quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is one of Paul's better ballads.I am not a big fan of the sound of sitars but give Paul credit for trying something differnt on &quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot;.I love &quot;Rinse The Ranindrops&quot;.I really enjoy the changes in Paul's voice during the song and the band rocks.It would have been better if it was little shorter.I am glad &quot;Freedom&quot; was included,it sounds better on the CD than the concert. Finally,Paul's bass playing is great and his vocals are pretty good.He should try to limit his range a little bit,he seems to strain on some high notes.Overall,this is one of Paul's best solo works.Trust me,most people will love it !!!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|this cd is all about fun pop music.  it is not a work of art and is not supposed to be.  i liked it better than her last albums because almost all of the songs were upbeat and even the slower ones kept my attention.  the goal of pop music is to be fun and entertaining and britney does just that with her newest cd.  if you are expecting meaningful lyrics, great singing, and intelligent songwriting, you went to the wrong artist.  this cd keeps me in a good mood while i sit in traffic so i think it's great.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is an absolute wonderful movie. I've never seen anything like it. It brings back the musical to Hollywood. Ewan and Nicole are absolutly breathtaking. Definatly one of the best and freshest movies of out time.
0385493622|4.0|Singh's book is not just about math or the history of Fermat's Last Theorem; it is an account of some of the greatest mathematicians of all time.  It was interesting to read why some mathematicians love their discipline so much, and I appreciate that Singh told the life story of each mathematician involved with Fermat's Last Theorem.  The mathematics within the text is so simple it seems as if anyone can do math, and it is interesting to see how many major developments were necessary before the infamous problem could even be solved.  Sometimes it is a little difficult to remember all the mathematicians' names and contributions, but that's because there are so many people who contributed to the solving of Fermat's enigma.  However, Singh compellingly recounts the saga behind the mystery, making this book a must read for anyone who is involved with math or just appreciates a fascinating, full-circle story.  My only criticism is that the Epilogue does not adequately describe the full effects solving Fermat's Last Theorem has had on Andrew Wiles, but this book was written shortly after the theorem was solved.  Perhaps Singh will write a follow-up book in which he explores more in-depth the ramifications this problem has had on Andrew Wiles, the math community, and mathematics as a discipline.
B00003CXSP|4.0|&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was one of the great movies of the decade, complete with superb acting, a solid script, fabulous directing, and just an all-around good crew. It won several oscars, including best picture, actor and actress. The movie was chilling thanks to the greatest performance of Anthony Hopkins' career, and poignant and redeeming thanks to Jodie Foster's. <BR>But &quot;Hannibal&quot; has a different director, a new Starling, but the same old Hopkins. It has a distinctly un-American feel to it, what with the very un-American Lecter and the slimy Paul Krendler (played well by a paunchy Ray Liotta) and mishappen Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).<BR>And though Lecter seems a ghost of his former self, one gets the feeling he's gotten soft since his heyday of the great escape, there are times when flashes of his old self are visible. <BR>Overall, a worthwhile movie, with different themes than &quot;Silence&quot;...don't come expecting the latter and you won't be disappointed.
B000002U82|5.0|I believe that this is a great album, but Pink Floyd fans should realize that this album was not their only good one. My dad has only DSOTM and the Wall. I bought Wish You Were Here and The Piper Gates at Dawn. I thought they were also exceptional. Even though DSOTM is amazing, it is not that they're like Backstreet Boys at being one hit wonders. They had tons of great stuff, but whenever I see the best albums shows, they never mention any other Pink Floyd stuff like Meddle and The Wall. Those were great too. I believe they got typecast. Whenever someone hears the name Pink Floyd, they immediately think Dark Side of the Moon. Pretty much everyone has this one, but Pink Floyd is probably [annoyed] about being remembered for DSOTM. I would encourage this album to be bought, but make sure you get other Pink Floyd stuff too. They have tons of other great stuff, and make sure you remember it!
6305014140|5.0|The gorgeous animation of this movie is what really makes it worthwhile.<BR>The plot is fun, if a little thin, and the scripting nothing special.<BR>But the animation makes up for all of the those deficiencies and then some. Very well-drawn and concieved characters and superbly choreographed action scenes that leave the viewer mesmerized.<BR>Worthwhile to enjoy the anime, if nothing else.
B000002MY3|5.0|This was an extreme cd. Very personal, however very capturing. Her voice is different from other artists, it is more harsh and not sweet. I'm tired of ..all those sweet sounding phonies. I highly recommend this cd to anyone. My favorite song is \\"You oughta know\\", I listened to it a million times. I didn't like \\"perfect\\" although i did detect sarcasm in it, it was depressing.(Actually, it [was terrible]) But everything else was very good. I really like the way everything blends together, her vocals and the instruments. I think that Alanis Morissette kicks a** with the feminine lyrics. I tired of \\"I luv you baby no matter what\\" Finally, some real life situation. Its sad, but men are NOT always perfect. Im not saying I don't like men/boys, (in fact, I like them a lot) but I like variety.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is one of those movies that is impossible to dislike.  Anyone will enjoy this movie.  Mike Myers brings out one of his funniest voices and teams up with the incredible humor of Eddie Murphy for an unforgettable movie.  From the beginning to the end of the movie you will be laughing (I laughed so hard at times I cried).<br />Parents, I would like to mention that this movie does include some adult themes which some parents could find too much for their small children, but I think that most kids would still enjoy it.<br />The DVD is loaded with all sorts of goodies too.  There are two discs with hours of entertainment.
B000002HGD|3.0|&quot;Everything Is Wrong&quot; has an interesting mix from rapid, techno-infused tracks to trance cuts to ballad-like folk tunes.  While several of the tracks are excellent (notably &quot;Feeling So Real&quot; &amp; &quot;First Cool Hive&quot;), I found the overall mix to be fairly jarring and incongruous.  IMO, not as good as &quot;Play&quot; album.
0140182829|5.0|I was interested in reading &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; after seeing that the English novelist John Fowles cited it as a major influence on his masterpiece &quot;The Magus.&quot;  I'm not disappointed, to say the least.  This is a rare gem of a novel that weaves mystery, adventure, intrigue, romanticism, and realism into a unique package that must have been way ahead of its time and still puts many modern &quot;suspense&quot; novels to shame with its superb prose and sheer elegance.<br />The novel takes place in a rural French village in the 1890's.  The narrator, Francois, is a young teenager who lives and studies at the village school, where his father is the headmaster.  One day a boy named Augustin Meaulnes, a couple of years older than Francois, enrolls as a new student and boarder.  Meaulnes is somewhat quiet and aloof, but he soon becomes popular with the other boys in the school.<br />One day Meaulnes expropriates a carriage to go to a nearby town on an errand and mysteriously disappears without explanation.  He returns to the school a few days later, but he admits that he doesn't know where he's been.  All he knows is that somehow he found himself in a strange, vague place -- a surreal, dreamlike realm that seemed to exist outside of the real world -- where he met a beautiful girl named Yvonne.  He pores over maps and searches for clues about this place -- the &quot;mysterious domain&quot; -- so that he can see Yvonne again, while Francois, fascinated by the story of his adventure, is determined to help him.<br />I would be doing a disservice to the potential reader by revealing any details of the nature of the &quot;mysterious domain&quot; or any more of the plot; so I will only say that every aspect of this novel is nothing short of brilliant, not only in its invention and unpredictability, but in the way it transforms itself by highlighting the contrast between the carefree dream-world of adolescence and the harsh realities of adulthood, and how our childish pastimes and fantasies inevitably give way to our sense of responsibility as we grow and mature.  In this manner, the plot actually &quot;matures&quot; with its characters, so that by the end, we see how &quot;grand&quot; a person Meaulnes really is.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I never heard about her. When I saw her, (...I) almost (...) burst...(...). The song &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; is strong enough to kick all US female artist off the charts. Christina Aguilara, Mandy Moore and all those twen female stars will look (...bad)when you hear Shakira. That's right. Like I said, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, the song &amp; the video clip is enough to confront even Madonna and Whitney Housten. That's all you need. <br />Shakira started singing when she was 13 (she is born in 1977) in Columbia. Now I understand what Manuel McCarthy is talking about. It (...stinks) to be born in an country other than US. If Shakira was born in the US, nobody would know Britney Spears (...).<br />I have listen to a few other songs on the CD. They aren't that good as you would expect. Some are.<br />The things that make Shakira rule:<br />1. SHE'S HOT! (...).<br />2. (...)<br />3. Amazing voice.<br />4. Her moves, you know, are incredible.<br />The things that make Shakira not rule:<br />1. She has a hard to-rember-name<br />2. Some songs on the CD (...stink).<br />3. She's too much involved into Arabic things.<br />I'm telling you, when you hear Shakira, other artist will sound like Britney Spears (...)I don't mean all artists.
B000002BHE|3.0|Celine's voice is undeniably powerful, but she never seems to pick material worthy of that voice. There are a few songs I like, which are &quot;Falling Into You,&quot; &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot; (a dramatic in a positive way story song), &quot;River Deep, Mountain High,&quot; and the closer, &quot;Fly.&quot; But, most songs are filler types. This is a better album than Let's Talk About Love, which has its share of clunkers. Everyone should have one Celine album for her voice, and this album will do, but I'd recommend her A Decade Of Song CD. Celine would do well to put in some old pop standards if she can't find better material. Or maybe she's not taking the time to look.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This is a DVD that delivers. I was disappointed at the first release, but to Cameron Crowe's credit, he told everybody that this was coming. I bought both versions and do not feel duped at all. This one was done right.<br />There are 3 discs. One is a Stillwater audio cd with 6 songs. The main disc has the Director's Cut of the movie with the commentary tracks and a few other goodies. The 3rd disc has the original theater release, and some more extras.<br />One thing that distinguishes &quot;Almost Famous&quot; from other DVD's with deleted scenes is that they are intergrated into the movie, as originally intended. The extra 30 minutes is really interesting and fits nicely. You don't need to seek them out in an extras section and watch them on their own, without understanding where they were supposed to play in the movie.<br />In addition, the Cameron Crowe commentary is truly awesome. It is very personal, and you learn a ton. It is worth the price all by itself.<br />This is a gem of a movie with a top notch DVD package. I'll own if forever and watch it many times over.
B000001EGA|5.0|This is probably one of, if not, my favorite albums ever produced by Elton John.   Although I believe that he revealed his superstar status with the release of &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;,  &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; was truly another Elton Masterpiece. If your not a die hard fan, then this is probably one of the Albums worth adding to your collection.  The level of creativity on this album cannot be matched. I've never tired listening to this album and believe that it is one of his best.
B000005IU2|5.0|I'd just like to say this: if you ever like to know what Iggy Pop is really made of: buy this. His voice is better than ever and the music is raw, funky, and fresh. You will understand what the fuss on the Stooges is all about. Never better.<BR>favorite track: &quot;Down on the street&quot;
0375707972|1.0|When I first read this book I liked it a lot. Then the more I thought about it, the more I found things wrong with it until I reached the point where I thought it was important to warn people about the dangers in it.<br />The first part deals with an abusive, horrible sexual relationship that somehow people are calling erotic and romantic. She used a kid that didn't know better and pummeled him into a submissive emotional dependence to the point where she scarred him for life (see his later marriage). I can expand on this but I don't think I need to and besides, the biggest problem is yet to come.<br />The moral dilemma about revealing her illiteracy was very interesting but it's extremely misplaced. Just because she was honest at the trial, that doesn't mean she even showed one sign that she wouldn't do any different if it happened again. So who cares about her shame?! First put the murderer away! And what about the other defendants who didn't even show guilt? By taking into consideration her shame, they got away with reduced sentences. Mass murderers no less. But read on...<br />Then there is the sympathy and all the work he went through to make her life slightly more pleasant. Perhaps she finally showed regret and a change at the end when she was reading about the holocaust, but the book does not mention or show this so we have no way of knowing what she was thinking. And besides, he didn't know what she was up to until after he did everything for her and after she died. And even if she did feel guilty, aren't there much better people worth helping? What about the surviving daughter? Talk about misplaced sympathy!<br />But all this isn't as bad as the overall big picture I got from the book. The main character was weak minded, apathetic and full of misplaced morals (another example of this is how he dealt with his marriage). All this led me to believe that it was because of people like him that the Nazis could get away with what they did. Guilt is meaningless andeven detrimental when it comes with passive behaviour. And sometimes guilt is even used as an excuse to feel human while committing inhuman actions. If Germany is populated with the likes of him nowadays and Nazis would rise to power, the holocaust would happen again. I have no doubt about that.<br />And don't tell me that this book is objective and cannot be criticised from a moral point of view because it isn't. It's unconsciously manipulative and VERY subtly monstrous. And the proof is that most of the reviews I read for this book describe this as a 'touching love story', a sympathetic view at human characters and real dilemmas, or praising it as putting a human face to Nazis.<br />So altogether I felt this book was pro-Nazi, despite its strong initial impression otherwise. The problem is not that it pictures Nazis as human with sympathetic emotions, but that it didn't condemn them despite their emotions. People would love to think of Nazis as cold hearted monsters but the truth is a Nazi lives potentially in every heart and if you are not careful, you can be a Nazi sympathizer too.
B000008GEF|5.0|The late,lamented George Harrison always seemed a bit out of step with his fellows. When guitars got louder, hebecae more introspective. When disco was dawning[and its inherent nihilism}, Harrison answered with ths pean to his Lord Krishna. The cover art and inside sleeveshould tell the listener what to expect. A large  print of the sacred {to Hindus and Buddhists} syllable, OM, and a draawing of Krishna andArjuna from the Bhagavad Gita adorn the inner sleeve.Most of the tracks here are beautiful, sweet{though Sue me,sueyou blues is a slap at paul and John, I believe},beginnign with Give me love{give me peace on earth}, one of Harrisons hit singles. Thelight that has Lighted the World is a tribute to Krishna,as are most of the cuts. The Lord loves te one who loves the Lord} is Harrisons song about the founder of the hari krishna movemnt[to which apparantly ,by his will, he was deovted his entire adult life} A lovely melodic album by and about a man on a deep search, who had, by this point found some of the answers that plague most sentinet beings.Not up to AL THINGS MUST PASS, thouigh not as far away  as you would think. Very very fine work form a sweet and gentle man.

B00005JKHP|4.0|This new 'finished' version of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, re-edited by Robert Wise, and with additional special effects, corrects many of the flaws of the original rushed cinema release, and makes the film much more watchable.<br />The new CGI footage blends in almost seamlessly with the 1979 original footage, and with the new edit, greatly enhances and clarifies the plot, and also improves the pacing of the film.<br />The extras are pretty good, especially the audio and text commentaries, though the three mini-documentaries could have been edited into one single documentary, and the first two (Lost Enterprise: Star Trek Phase II, and The Making of The Motion Picture) could really do with being a lot longer.<br />The new sound mix is awesome - the improvement between the mix in the movie and in the deleted scenes is very obvious. The musical score is even more stirring than ever, and is much enhanced by the new sound mix.<br />One big missed opportunity is the quality of the transfer. We have for the first time a widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1 picture, with excellent color definition, but the print exhibits many minor flecks and spots and occasionally even some faint scratches. It really could have done with a clean-up. <br />Additionally the matte lines in many of the 1979 effects shots are very noticable (mainly because of the high quality of the transfer), and digitally removing them would have been a major improvement.<br />Overall I would have rated the disk with a 5 if the print had been cleaned up, but this is still an essential addition to anyone's DVD collection, and a must for Trekkers.

B00005OMTT|5.0|This greatest hits compilation from Enigma is everything I could ask for.  The only other Enigma CD I owned was The Screen Behind the Mirror, but listening to Internet radio stations on Shoutcast, I craved more.  Enigma answered this need with perfect timing.  This album contains a whopping 70+ minutes of the very best of Enigma, so it is an excellent value for the price.  This is a perfect mix of Enigma's best work and the tracks segue perfectly for a 70+ minute experience.  Plus, they are remastered.  It was a welcome treat to hear songs I knew from Screen Behind the Mirror in a slightly different light.<br />Overall, this is an excellent value, especially for Enigma newcomers.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This film had a very realistic feel to it, in terms of feeling as if you are actually witnessing the fall of George Jung.  The very human side of Jung was portrayed as well, enabling the viewer to decide whether they wanted to really hate him as much as they think they would loathe a typical dope pusher, or to feel some empathy for how far he sunk into his world of coke and pot dealing, at the cost of his relationship with family and his freedom.  All in all, an excellent, realistic portrayal of the risky, dark, and depressing world of drug dealing.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|A RIDE THROUGH THE WORLD OF OVERWHELMING AND PASSAIONATE METAL RELEAM. THIS 60 MINUTES PLUS LATEST OFFERING OF MAIDEN IS A WONDERFUL GLIMPSE OF 80'S AND EARLY 90'S ENTHRILLING METAL AND A VIRTUOUS DISPLAY OF WHAT METAL USED TO BE IN IT'S GLORIUS DAYS. IN SIMPLE THIS AN EXCELANT ALBUM FEATURING GREAT BASE LINES,ENERGY,PASSION LYRICS, RYTHEM AND MELODIC APPEAL WITH COMPLEX SONG STRUCTURES NOT VERY SIMMILAR TO METALLICA. THIS IS WHAT GREAT ABOUT METALLICA AND MAIDEN THAT THEY HAD SHOWN WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO FOR THIER FANS AND ADDITIONALLY MUSIC, EITHER IT IS OF ANY GENRE, SHOULD NOT BE RYTHEMLESS, ADORELESS, PLAIN DULL AND BEREFT OF ANY CREATIVITY. WHICH IS SHOWN BY MOST OF THE PRESENT METAL ARTISTS. I'M NOT A HEAD BANGER IN A PERFECT SENSE AND DONT LISTEN TO METAL FREQUENTLY THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT 4.5 STARS.<BR>IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE LIKE ME WHO HATE THE PRESENT SITUATION OF METAL (PROGRESSIVE, ALTERNATIVE, GRUNGE, RAP).THEN THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU. FULL OF PASSION, ENERGY, FURIUOS YET MELODIC(MISSING INGREDIENT IN METAL TODAY) AND WONDERFULLY WRITTEN.<BR>ALTHOUGH WHOLE OF THE ALBUM IS GREAT. BUT THE DEFINING MOMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THE MERCENARY, BLOOD BROTHERS, GHOST OF THE NAVIGATOR, BRAVE NEW WORLD, AND THE NORMAD.GET THIS ONE U WONT FEEL SORRY.THIS IS THE ONLY BAND OF METALLICA'S CALIBRE AND A SERIOUS THREAT TO THEM. TAKE MY WORD AND DO LISTEN TO THIS EXTRAORDIANRY ALBUM. ...
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's new CD is great! I love all the songs! When I first heard &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; on the radio, I didn't think it was that good. And the music video wasn't all that great either. I was expectiong the album to be her worst. But I love every song! It took me a while to get used to &quot;Slave&quot; but all the other songs are so good, you forget about it. The truely great songs are &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;lonely&quot;, &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;, and &quot;What it's Like To Be Me&quot; wich was written by Britney's Boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, who you can hear singing backup. Her cover of the classic &quot;I Love Rock N' Roll&quot; is also very good. If you enjoyed Britney's past CD's or if you like NSYNC, you're sure to love this album!
B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD is great. I purchased it the day of its release, just like all other Britney albums, and it was better than I had expected. Don't let the title track, &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U,&quot; fool you. If you don't like the song, don't judge the rest of the album. It wasn't a smart choice as a first single, but it does show Britney's sound has changed.<br />Although I do reccommend you buy her previous CD, &quot;Oops!...I Did it Again,&quot; before getting this one, I still suggest you get this for a family member or friend for the Holidays! (Or heck, even yourself!)<br />The only downfall on this album is the song &quot;Boys,&quot; which it seems asthough Britney is talking the whole song instead of singing. The good songs include the beautiful ballad, &quot;Not a Girl,&quot; and upbeat songs, &quot;Overprotected,&quot; &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;Lonley,&quot; and &quot;Anticpating.&quot;<br />If you're a Briney fan, no doubt about it.. this is FOR YOU! Not a Britney fan? Give her a chance.. get this album. You have nothing to loose but $ and a load of great music ;)rack which is sung some honesty. And yet, Britney's able to take the best of all these elements and turn them into a very catchy collection of songs. And she pulls it off in her teasing captivating style, even if it's not all hers.his almost 20 year old singer has achieved with three hit albums! First, give her credit for some of the icon-like sales figures she's posted during her three-year recording career. To date, Spears has SoundScanned a jaw-dropping 8.68 million copies of Oops!...I Did It Again and 10.22 million copies of ...Baby One More Time. Those numbers fare considerably well when stacked against milestone albums by female artists such as Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (6.01 million copies sold), Jewel's Pieces of You (6.95 million), Mariah Carey's Daydream (7.49 million), Celine Dion's Let's Talk About Love (9.1 million) and Falling Into You (10.42 million), and Whitney Houston's &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack (11.68 million). In time, Spears' ...Baby debut could even rub sales shoulders with Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill (13.86 million copies sold) and Shania Twain's Come on Over (14.06 million). Currently, Britney's new album, &quot;Britney,&quot; is NUMBER 1 in the Billboard charts selling more than 700,000 and KNOCKING OFF Michael Jackson and I am not very surprised why. She has developed growing fan bases around the country and the world, making her indeed, the POP ICON of our generation who will evolve for years to come. Just watch. Just watch...<br />I'd also like to point out how far she has managed to outdistance fellow teen singer Christina Aguilera, whose 1999 debut has sold some 7.81 million copies. And with 19.6 million in career sales to date, Britney has already sold more LPs in just three years than Madonna has done in the last 10, with Madonna tallying just over 19 million in total album sales since January 1992. Too amazing huh? Too amazing.<br />Overall, there's definitely no reason why YOU, yes YOU, should be influenced by too unfair and disrespectful people regarding buying Brit's new album. People like them have no respect. Yes, that's their opinions but come on, wishing Britney, a girl who had dreams and successfully achieved them, &quot;gone,&quot; that's just too sad and unconsiderate. Who cares if Britney dresses sexy, she is who she is and people should respect her individuality. Finally, who cares if Britney didn't write all the songs in her new album or she's showing too much skin? Just like the message in her song, &quot;Not a girl...not yet a woman,&quot; she's still growing not just a woman but also as an artist...so give her time and chance to show her starpower in the years to come.
0380788624|4.0|This book is flawed, but in the best way, in that the execution is hampered only by the daring ambition of the author, and the ambition is achieved sufficiently to keep the reader engrossed and make the flaws themselves very interesting.  Stephenson sustains this with a certain humorous and quirky approach to style and characterization that is very appealing.  It seems, though, that he makes all his characters as clever has he is, and gives them a similar dry wit.  <br />As an interested layman with respect to most of the technical topics laid out in Cryptonomicon, this was a fun way to learn something without knowing whether it really makes sense to an expert.  The list of topics include: much about how compters and networks operate, much about cryptography/ology, the Philippines, U-Boats, venture capital etc.  The fun is in the characters, the worldwide travels, the constant bouncing between WWII days and the present day, and all the intertwinings of plot, character, time and detail that make the this book a true roller-coaster ride.  <br />Clearly, this book was written by someone whose mind was heading in a thousand directions at once, and that tendency was indulged.  If you enjoy following a broad mind in somewhat disorganized fashion and just letting things flow, you will not be disappointed.  If you are looking for a well-organized story without loose ends, then you will not like this book.

B00003CX9E|5.0|There's not much I can say about Citizen Kane itself that hasn't been said before.  Is Citizen Kane &quot;the best film ever made?&quot;  When you get down to it, who cares?  It's a superb film.<br />Ebert's commentary adds to this DVD an entertaining and enlightening lecture on the art of film-making.  In my opinion, that commentary alone is worth the price of the disk, and provides a benchmark against which other DVD commentaries might get measured.  Given that Citizen Kane, itself, is a benchmark film, this is probably only fitting.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|I bought this album in December of 2000.  Some of the songs (Lady Madonna, From Me to You) I had never heard before and others such as Penny Lane, I had heard of, but never heard. (Yes, I was born well after the break-up) This album stuck in my head and my consciousness and since that time I have read Beatle books, seen the Anthology movie, and own many other albums.  Yes, wonderful, important songs aren't here, such as &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, but if EVERY great song was on this album, it would have to be five CDs long.  This is enough to lay it out for people to decide if they want to investigate the Beatles further.  Without this album, I would have never found my way to the other great songs of this band

I've read and enjoyed immensely a couple of WS novels since then, but never one such as River God.<BR>I was instantly transported to the world of ancient Egypt, much as SF fans love to be transported to other worlds. I can't possibly rate this novel highly enough. Not caring or knowing too much about the authenticity, (surely, reading a novel is about enjoyment first, if you want to nitpick, become a bloody critic!!) the way that WS involves you in the characters and the time is just phenomenal!

B00005LOUS|2.0|&quot;The Grinch&quot; offers very little to the audience other than overwhelming visual candy. <br />A few comments:<BR>~ Many people went to the movie to see Jim Carey. Unfortunately that is all the audience saw in the Grinch, Jim Carey. The producers let Carey use too much of his own persona which only served to overshadow the character of the Grinch.<BR>~ The movie relied too much on visual tricks and make-up versus a solid script and plot, this immensely takes away from the storyline.<BR>~ I highly doubt that Dr. Suess intended for the story to contain gross humor i.e. belching, farting, etc...<br />Overall, I found the movie to be less than appealing. <br />Take your family out to a different movie, your time will be better spent.

0399103422|5.0|Mario Puzo's Godfather is a reality based fiction about a big time mob family in New York City.  The Godfather is about the struggles a crime family has with everything from marriage to murder. The father of the family is a notorious crime lord who made his way up starting as an immigrant from Sicily trying to become successful for his family.  Widely respected by his peers in crime throughout the nation for his great reasoning, he was named the Godfather by many as a sign of respect.  This book was very interesting in the way it intertwined all the different characters in the novel and the plot thickened as you turned each page.  I loved how Puzo delved into a society that I knew very little about and delved into each strand of the plot thoroughly.  This book suggests that if a man wants to he can become his own king, but many troubles come with this fraudulent power.  Finally, the Godfather gave me an escape from the dull books in school and gave me an awesome experience filled with great descriptions and storyline.  Overall, I think this is one of the best books I have ever read and I recommend it to anybody who loves action and suspense.
B00005QZWJ|1.0|While the music of this CD is exquisite fantasy fare, the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; packaging is far from magical. For almost twice the price of the regular version, you receive almost nothing in the way of extras and exactly the same music as on the regular edition disk. The additional cost is apparently accounted for in the &quot;leather-like&quot; slipcase and the &quot;art book&quot; that are small recompense for the additional cost. It's no wonder the sheet on the back of the package says nothing with regard to the &quot;limited edition&quot; contents, since there is almost nothing extra offered.<br />This product is clearly just a stab at the &quot;fan&quot; market with the hope that by adding the &quot;limited edition&quot; stamp to the title it will fool more buyers into spending nearly twice the price. If you are simply interested in the excellent soundtrack, buy the regular version. I wish I had. I could have used the difference in cost to buy another CD.<br />Five stars for the music, one big star, for the disappointing exploitation of fans.
0385505833|5.0|Who *hasn't* felt the way Luther and Nora Krank feel when they decide to sit this Christmas out? Identification with that feeling immediately connects you to the main characters of this charming, outrageously funny book. The societal pressures the Kranks have to face in their quest for a non-holiday holiday are those that, while made larger for the sake of fiction, we all face when deviating from the norm. More subtly, I imagine Grisham has illuminated what it must feel like to be one of the small groups of Americans who don't celebrate Christmas *any* year.<br />I dare not say more lest I give away any of the plot of this absolutely terrific book. Just read it, you'll love it -- as long as you're looking for something fun. This book is not meant to be great literary fiction. It is a light-hearted Christmas tale with a sappy ending. (Would you really want anything different for a Christmas story?) It's a quick read (I read it in two hours) and laugh-out-loud funny. I actually laughed myself to tears reading this book -- a first for me!<br />I highly recommend this tale as a respite from the stresses of the holidays -- perhaps while waiting to get on a plane to your holiday destination!
0451203933|5.0|This is simply one of the best books I've ever read.  Bowden succeeds in writing a detailed account of an intricate battle that is easy to follow and he even manages to OBJECTIVELY explain the complex political and cultural issues in Somalia, and the US response to the events of 10/3/93 (so the reader can form his/her own opinions-- imagine that!).  <br />I've seen reviews that criticize Bowden's writing style, but it's his simplistic, straightforward and balanced approach that makes it so readable and accessible to everyone.  I like the way he intertwined personal information about the soldiers in with the battle scenes, so their injuries and deaths would matter to the reader.  He was also respectful of the Somalians and in explaining their situation.  His objectivity lends great credibility to the account and makes it a compelling and deeply moving book.
B000002J20|1.0|This album is best served by those who use &quot;eclectic&quot; regularly in their vocabulary. &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; it is not.
B00003CXTF|1.0|This movie is a great disappointment. The historical perspective is distorted. It's just a mushy love story with the attack on Pearl Harbor as the backdrop. The attack as depicted seems like a Star Wars battle. The planes were flying outside the realm of their capabilities. The resort to computer imaging is obvious. This is way way below the benchmark for films on Pearl Harbor - Tora, Tora, Tora.
B00003CXXS|2.0|That should say it all for Sam Niell's Dr. Alan Grant. Still, only five minutes later, Grant is accepting a large check and is on a helicopter to Isla Sorna. Another example of art imitating life as the only reason for making this movie was for a quick paycheck.<br />JP3 lacks the freshness of the other two films in the franchise, suffers from the lack of a human villain, an abrupt ending, and even sends out the wrong message to kids of divorced parents: &quot;Kids! Wanna get your folks back together? Put yourself in mortal danger!&quot; Please...<br />Finally even, the much hyped showdown between T-Rex and the bigger spinosaurus, was over and done too quickly to keep our interest. All in all, this was a color by numbers effort by all concerned...
B000002P5R|4.0|It should not be expected that compilations of unreleased material should live up to an artist's fundamental body of work, but the posthumous Jimi Hendrix collection, First Rays a New Rising Sun, comes pretty close. Most of its material was compiled from work meant for the guitar-slinging hippie hero's forth studio album, which he was in the midst of recording at the time of his unfortunate death in 1970. The LP was meant to be a return to the highway-roaming, rapid-fire rock of his debut, 1967's Are You Experienced. If songs such as the rollicking \\"Dolly Dagger,\\" the impassioned \\"Ezy Rider,\\" the Vietnam-inspired \\"Izabella,\\" the epic title track and the anthems, \\"Earth Blues\\" and \\"Freedom\\" are any indications, Hendrix had a good chance at topping himself. Of coarse, First Rays does include a few tracks that may have been improved or deleted if Hendrix had completed this work, such as the half-baked \\"Astro Man\\" and the ironically meandering \\"Straight Ahead.\\" But for a collection of unreleased work, First Rays of a New Rising Sun is absolutely as good as they come.

B000002U9Y|3.0|Few bands are forced to reinvent themselves on their second album, but such was the case for Pink Floyd. Although they would eventually find astonishing commercial and artistic success without him, in 1968 the band was deeply concerned that their frontman, Syd Barrett, would not be able to produce the heady poprock that made their debut singles and their first album, 1967's Piper at the Gates of Dawn such sucesses. Barrett had started to act outlandish and unpredictable and was writing little new material. The band excused him from touring, recruiting guitarist, David Gilmour, to take his place onstage, hoping that it would take pressure off and rekinde Barrett's creativity. But he only penned one song for the band's second album, the haunting \\"Jugband Blues,\\" which drolly established how he felt about the arrangement, \\"It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here/And I'm almost obliged to you for making it clear/That I'm not here.\\" The band's secondary songwriters, keyboardist, Rick Wright, and bass-player, Roger Waters, then took the helm.<br />Thankfully, Waters and Wright did not attempt to recreate Piper, but rather stamped 1968's A Saucerful of Secrets with their own unique visions: Waters' sinister, slow-building cosmic freak-outs (\\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\\" the striking \\"Let There Be More Light\\") and Wright's wavy, surreal gloominess (\\"Remember a Day,\\" \\"See-Saw\\"). Of coarse making such a trasition completely smoothly is nearrly impossible. Waters' first crack at disgruntled World War II veterans, \\"Corporal Clegg\\" was a bit too cartoony; Wright's \\"See-Saw\\" perhaps should have kept the working title Waters supposedly assigned it, \\"The Most Boring Song I Have Ever Heard\\" and the sprawling, instrumental title track has its moments but is too unscructured to work well as whole. Still, Waters and Wright managed enough powerful moments and created a distict enough earmark to successfully change Pink Floyd's image from psychedelic daydreamers to dark voyagers.
0805062971|5.0|I cannot say enough about this novel.  I read it because I saw the movie, but the book is much better.  This will introduce you into a whole new way of thinking and perhaps change some of your daily habits.<br />It does a great job of showing the characters life and why he has to do what he has to do.  I won't ruin it, incase you have yet to see the movie or read the book.  Definitely read this if you have seen the movie.  The thing that caught me most was Palahniuk's descriptions.  His writing is superb, if dark.  A must read.
B000007PSR|1.0|Like Time of No Reply, a fine collection of unreleased material from fellow troubled, British folkie, Nick Drake compiled by Island Records in 1986, Capital's 1988 Syd Barrett offering, Opel, represents a record company' realization that a largely ignored artist, signed years earlier, had slowly become a mysterious, cult legend who had gathered a devout following feverishly demanding new material. Opel is a collection of wooly outtakes from the onetime Pink Floyd frontman's two much-admired solo works, 1970's the Madcap Laughs and Barrett. Unfortunately those albums provided little unused material ready for release. Opel is simply a collection of abandoned songs and pitifully underdeveloped versions of a few released tracks. The tracks, all of which feature only Barrett on acoustic guitar, are all mere sketches. Underproduction may have worked well for the eccentric songwriter in many instances but utter incompleteness in another matter. It makes Opel a tedious, frustrating listen that adds nothing noteworthy to the Barrett mythos. Capital, unlike Island, had nothing new to offer the acolytes of their roster's cult legend.
B000053GTF|5.0|For the ultimate Celine Dion fan - consider purchasing the &quot;One Night Only&quot; DVD by The Bee Gees.  It features Celine singing &quot;Immortality&quot;.  Another great moment is the tribute to Andy Gibb (not to mention seeing Olivia Newton-John in the audience).  This is a 10-second review of a wonderful DVD that contains some of the many many Bee Gees hits over the last 35 or so years.  Buy it now.
B000007MVM|5.0|One could argue that Syd Barrett never intended for his 1971 first solo debut to be as hauntingly intimant as it is. Perhaps the former Pink Floyd frontman was only attempting to channel the charisma and playfulness of his work with the Floyd and accidentally discovered the outstanding starkness of the Madcap Laughs while attempting peel through the layers of brain damage, frustration and psychotherapy to find his knack again. Either way, Barrett created a disturbingly compelling work.<br />The Madcap Laughs presents the post-breakdown Barrett; the slow-strumming, word-slurring, red-eyed depressive who was briskly engulfed by the pressures of rock stardom and the effects of LSD and then passed through the revolving door of underdeveloped 60s psychotherapy. A restructured identity does not mean Barrett has lost all of his boyish, poprock charm. Although the production is much scratchier than that of Floyd, the albums first side somewhat brings back that psychedelic Ray Davies who made Pink Floyds lush debut, the Piper at the Gates of Dawn so fine. Theres just something more manic, more downbeaten about the work that reflects Syds state of mind, such as the chronic mumbling of Here I Go and No Mans Land or the Prozac cheerfulness of Octopus and Love You or the more direct pleas of Dark Globe. (My head kissed the ground/I was half the way down/Treading the sand/Please, please, please lift the hand/I'm only a person with Eskimo chain/I tattooed my brain all the way/Won't you miss me?/Wouldn't you miss me at all? ).<br />In a way, this frantic first half hooks listeners into Syds colorful world and works to effective drudge them through the bleakness of the second. After the perky Octopus, Syd adds music to a James Joyce poem with Golden Hair and feverishly shrieks for a departed lover on the breathtaking Long Gone. What follows is probably some of the oddest music of the psychedelic age. With a sole, brittle, acoustic guitar and practically no involvement from producers, Syd murmurs through the song-suite of She Took a Long Cold Look, Feel, and If Its In You almost incoherently tossing shaky phrases like broken pier on the wavy sea, the end of truth, inside my eye be the lonely one, my bride and skeleton kissed the steel rail in a primitive word-bath. The listener wants to cheer the songwriter who charmed him or her so effectively on Terrapin and Here I Go, he or she wants Syd to think a happy thought or a sensible expression but the words are too dismal and the speech too blurry to appease any hopes.<br />The suite is complimented, but not outdone by the albums wailing, forbidding closer, Late Night, a song that effectively sums up the feel of this somewhat accidental masterpiece: When I lay still at night seeing/Stars high and light/Then I wanted to be with you/When the rooftops shone dark/All alone saw a spark/Spark of love just to stay with you/Inside me I feel alone and unreal.
B00005LOUP|4.0|I was prepared to hate this movie because what I had seen of Dr. Seuss books, I didn't really care for.  But not having grown up with the wierd Doctor may have helped me get over the complaints of some Grinch fans out there who are quibbling over the adaption to the widescreen.  <BR>I am now prepared to sit thru this Jim Carrey vehicle just like I sit thru NAT LAMPS CHRISTMAS VACATION, THE CHRISTMAS STORY and, yes, even IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE once a year.  I must admit it's a little harder to get into the spirit this year but this movie had me thinking about nothing but the holiday coming up.<BR>Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch but the little girl looks too much like Jon Benet Ramsey.  Other than that, this DVD goes right next to the other classics I mentioned above.  I haven't given it 5 stars ... yet!  (A couple of Christmases to go before it seeps in.)
0385505833|4.0|Grisham is a brilliant storyteller, with a dry sense of humour. This is light-hearted and fun, although amusing rather than funny. Don't expect the usual depths of character and plot you may normally associate with this great author. For me &quot;The Testament&quot; is his best. But this is definitely worth reading. I enjoyed it.
6301969588|3.0|In one sense, FREAKS is not a greatly well-make film. The plot is little more than soap-opera, the script is weak, the performances are merely adequate, and the cinematography and sound are occasionally a bit less than adequate. Even so, it is a very memorable film.  The thing which makes the film memorable? Why, the &quot;Freaks,&quot; of course.<br />Some of these so-called &quot;freaks,&quot; such as the famous Hilton sisters, were actually popular stage performers; others were from circuses, carnvials, and sideshows. Among the latter we find several performers who are very obviously mentally impaired. Their presence gives the film a certain aura of explotation that will likely make a modern viewer feel more than a little uncomfortable. The viewer's discomfort is further increased because, with the exception of a very few (again, the Hilton sisters come to mind), these performers do not actually perform at all. They simply exist, and director Browning uses them much as one would use a set device or a special effect. The the result can be profoundly disturbing indeed, particularly in the film's climax, when we watch the &quot;Freaks&quot; flop, slither, and crawl through the mud in a driving rain--and more disturbing still when one of the most obviously mentally impaired cheerfully picks up a knife with which to attack their victim.<br />I generally tell people they should see the film at least once. After that--it rather depends on how you feel about it, whether or not you think the director is justified in the display. And that is no &quot;modern&quot; issue--it was the issue then as well. For myself, I have seen the film at least three times: once at a film festival; once, when it was rented by a friend who wished to see it; and once when it just happened to be the only going on cable tv at 2 in the morning. And my own feelings about it? I don't know. I bet you won't either. And that, really, is why FREAKS remains such a disturbing film even to this day.
B0000027RL|5.0|I remember the first time I heard Ten.<br />I was sitting in my girlfriends bedroom talking, and she stuck in this (...)-up Pink CD. I asked her \\"what is that? some weird 80s rock band?\\" She gave me a look that could kill before Once began... I sat, contemplatively as I took in the melody which is known to true Pearl Jam fanatics as Master/Slave. I had never been much of a rock fan at all, and the only thing about Pearl Jam I knew was a poster I had seen at A&B sound with a Yield sign on the middle of an open road, and a kickass video by Todd McFarlane. I was grabbed by Once immediately, imersing myself in the anger and pain of the lyrics. And my utter fascination never faltered. Even on the lesser known tracks, such as Why Go and Deep, I found myself engourged in the mixture of metal, rock, 70s funk, and classic Blues that made Pearl Jam what they are. The beginning guitar riff to Garden hit me with an instant reminder of Led Zeppelin, only original.<br />The album showed me the greatness of Grunge, and by extension, Rock & Roll entirely. Every time I hear this album, I thank my girlfriend for putting in that disgusting looking CD into the player.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was awe struck!  This movie has everything that a music lover would want plus 10 x's more!  The songs for this movie are arranged in the most creative ways...bringng songs from today &amp; yesterday together to describe an incredible love story!  It reminds me of a twist between Pretty Woman meets Romeo &amp; Juliet meets the Mtv Music awards!!!  It is crazy fun and will definitely keep you entertained through out the movie and a bit disappointed that it has to come to an end.  I am glad that I can purchase the DVD since I will be definitely wearing this movie out! Hope you like it too!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|My wife and I rented this movie expecting a somewhat lackluster experience. We loved it. We were laughing constantly throughout the movie, and especially during the Gingerbread Man scenes. I actually read a review for this film that picked apart the technical aspects of the film. Don't listen to him or anyone else trying to tell you this film isn't worth seeing. The jokes are there for all ages, and will keep you laughing for the entire movie. Any adults watching the film on DVD will fall out of their seats when watching an extra scene in which Eddie Murphy's character raps an old Sir Mix-a-lot's song. (You know the one I'm talking about.) Rent, buy watch. You won't feel as though you've wasted your time or money.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|To begin, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's slow, it's shabby, it's shotty and it sucks. Too much garbage was added into this movie. The Grinch going to Whoville to accept his award made me fall asleep. The Grinch &quot;casing&quot; Whoville in a disguise was another disaster. The ending above all should have been left alone. It should have ended just like the original. Ron Howard in his infinite wisdom couldn't even do that. All around this movie should have never been made. The extras on the DVD were boring as well. Keep away from this movie.
0345440757|4.0|Anyone who has read any of the literature about caring for infants will know that there is plenty of conflicting advice - and all of it is backed up some kind of doctor or suitably acronymed society.  So what do you do ?<BR>Well - you figure it out for yourself, and to do so, you need reasonable sources of information.  And this book is one of them - sure there are parts of it that you may choose to ignore, but I found it immensely helpful and reasonable at a time (around 3 months old) when it all seemed to be getting too much.  In reality, you just need to relax a bit - you'll look back and laugh at how stressed you used to be, but this book will help you see things in perspective.<BR>My only complaint was that the tables in the book made it appear as if all children fitted into neat little categories - that's just not my experience.   Overall a very worthwhile purchase though.<br />ps: I shouldn't have to say this, but all the quack doctors waffling on about how this book is wrong and theirs is perfect in the other reviews ought to be ashamed of themselves - and they call themselves professionals ! Who would you trust ?
B00005OAIE|5.0|What is up with this Ricky guy? Was he listening to this cd or did he get mixed up because I don't know that you can complain about anything on it. There is way more to his music than his lyrics. He's one of the best guitarists I have heard. This is the coolest cd I have heard in a while. It's got a great range of songs, most of them sounding pretty mellow. My favorites, well I love thme all. If you like DMB or Ben Folds, get this CD. If you don't but you are looking for something new get this cd. Everyone just buy this CD.
B000001FZK|5.0|Quick! The first things you think of when the name of Talk Talk is uttered:<br />1982, New Romantics, synthesizers, Anglophillic vocals, MTV (hey, even MV3...Richard Blade), &quot;Talk Talk&quot; (the song), white suits, lopsided hair-dos.<br />Now the last things you think of when it comes to Talk Talk:<br />Haunting soundscapes, soulful vocals, eerie sentiments of loss &amp; longing, jazzy influences, organic instrumentation, updated psychedelia, Hammond B-3 organ dirt.<br />Well, the latter is very much the truth, especially when it applies to Talk Talk's final album, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;. Getting acquainted with it in 1996, five years after its release, took me by shock when I heard it in a reocrd store (and kudos to that person who decided to throw this on the system).<br />&quot;Laughing Stock&quot; has been compared to numerous artists over the years ranging from Steve Winwood to John Martyn, and the similarities are very understandable (I have a car tape with Martyn &amp; Talk Talk that I play on a good basis). To me, it reminds me of latter period Rascals (1969-1972), only slowed down quite a bit.<br />Mark Hollis is a most unusual soul singer. He could have slipped into a plastic 80's soul bag mode (a' la overproduced and slick production values...in fact, come to think of it, he did with the &quot;Colour Of Spring&quot;). But with albums like &quot;Spirit Of Eden&quot; and &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, the efforts sound like Hollis is learning how to sing all over again. And by going this direction, he sacrificed every damned temptation and commercial trapping that was redemptive to his soul and damning to his popular career.<br />And it works. Obviously, he discovered some new things about himself that are hard to ignore, for there's some serious pain being voiced. What was once a rather melodramatic instrument used for a slick pop product (though I'll give nods towards 1984's &quot;It's My Life&quot; album for taking a small step forward), turns into a voice that reveals a true human frailty that makes it a challenge to listen to sometimes. It creeps into the soul quite effectively, alongside the stripped down arrangements that are jazzy, haunting and reminiscent of the early 70's British jazz-folk movement.<br />When I hear Mark's voice, not only do I hear Martyn and the Rascals' Eddie Brigati &amp; Felix Cavaliere, but also Robert Wyatt &amp; Richard Thompson (brother Danny played on &quot;The Spirit of Eden&quot;). Strange bedfellows? Perhaps. But there's a lot of folk roots in those above singers, whether they may be from singing renditions of 'John Barleycorn' in folk pub circles or New Jersey blue eyed soul played garage-style in skating rinks &amp; teen clubs. Hollis's soul was always there, but it had to take a few knocks along the way (one of the major ones being the 80's).<br />There's only 6 tracks, but all are excellent. &quot;Ascension Day&quot; with its long droning lines, garage/jazz rhythm guitar and lyrics that are clearly open to interpretation (they're not happy ones) builds up to a beautiful intensity until it's cold cut-off and sudden segue into &quot;After The Flood&quot; with it's opening of tranquil piano notes into a nine minute epic with a metronomic jazz drum pattern, harmonica, organ and some remarkable chord changes. &quot;Taphead&quot; is damn eerie, as well as &quot;Myrrhman&quot; (with it's sad muted trumpet) and the closer &quot;Runeii&quot;. Only &quot;New Grass&quot; provides some slight emotional relief.<br />This album is cut from the cloth of the great Prog Rock tradition: plenty of space for composition, breath and approach. Forget the 3 minute pop singles. It's not welcome here. <br />It's also true and faithful to Eric Dolphy's great philosophy of music, that when it's played, it disappears into air, never to be recovered again. Maybe tape can be a slight remedy to capturing that magic, but what about the after-effects on the soul itself? It's the moment that cannot berecaptured, no matter how much you want to try to revisit or relive it. It's impossible.<br />&quot;Laughing Stock&quot; is a beautiful example of the above philosophy. A moment in time that cannot and will not be relived. Thankfully, there's the record.
0452282152|5.0|I satrted this novel thinking, &quot;How boring is this going to be?!  17th century Sweden!&quot;  I mean, I was reading it for my history class, and I knew my mother had read it for her middle-aged women book club.  I am a fourteen year old girl, and once I got into Girl With a Pearl Earring, I could not put it down.  I actually found it interesting!  I finished it in a day, and I was embarrassed to tell my friends in school that I had enjoyed it.  I went to school that Monday discoving that almost half of my class had also finished it in a day and loved it, too!  So if you are looking for a historical (but VERY interesting) book, whether it be for your book club, your grandchild, or yourself, I highly suggest reading Girl With a Pearl Earring.  You won't regret it, and after you finish it you'll find yourself searching amazon.com for more books similar to it (like me!).
6305949980|5.0|If you think the best movies are the ones that show you a world you've never envisioned before, then you will LOVE Tim Burton's &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.  A benchmark in stop-motion animation, this incredibly difficult-to-make film (24 individually posed frames were needed to produce ONE SECONDS's worth of action) is a masterpiece of art direction, set design, and good old-fashioned storytelling.  The plot revolves around Jack, the Pumpkin King of Halloween, and his attempt to run Christmas in place of Santa Claus.  &quot;Sleigh&quot; becomes confused with &quot;slay&quot;; &quot;stockings&quot; become &quot;stalkings&quot;; and spirits go from joyous to ghostly as the two holidays clash together like oil and water, or fire and ice.  One of the great surprises of the movie is that although it dances around material that could easily careen into cynicism, it remains refreshingly sweet and light throughout.  Which is not to say that some of the comedy isn't a little dark and perhaps geared more towards older children and adults; for example, the brief scene in which a python puppet is shown swallowing a Christmas tree whole is hysterically funny, but not especially appropriate for the very young.<br />The special edition DVD is unquestionably the version of this classic to buy.  Included are a wealth of extras: the teaser and theatrical trailers; a documentary on &quot;The Making of ...&quot;; deleted scenes and storyboards, etc, etc.  The best bonuses are two short films by Burton: &quot;Vincent&quot;, a poetic tribute to the magnificent Vincent Price, narrated by the subject himself; and &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, a canine send-up of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, starring Shelley Duvall, Daniel Stern, and a cast of talented character actors.  This DVD is one that you can spend HOURS exploring happily!  Highly recommended as both a Halloween and Christmas treat.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has delivered a fantastic album. There are a lot of different styles and sounds on it, but Britney's voice pulls it all together. The CD contains R&amp;B influenced songs, like Slave, Boys and Lonely, but there are also really good pop songs, like Cinderella, Overprotected and Anticipating. And of course there is this beautiful ballad Not A Girl. I just saw the video, and let me tell ya, it's amazing. Here in Europe, we have one extra song. It's a fantastic ballad called When I Found You. Britney wrote 5 songs on the album, and she has proven that she's more than just a pretty girl.
B00003CXTG|4.0|This was a great film with gorgeous scenery, explosive sound and exceptional acting led by Ben Affleck, .  In short, the movie was at first a love story followed by the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and lastly a top secret mission to bomb Japan.  The plot flowed well and the character development was quite good.  Some may find the love story to be over-the-top for a movie such as this but it threaded through the entire movie seamlessly.<br />(TV: 32&quot; Sony Trinitron (KV-32S40))<BR>(DVD player: Panasonic RP-56)<BR>(Cables: Acoustic Reasearch top-of-the-line)<br />Picture quality: Excellent.  Crisp and clear as paper.<br />Sound quality: EXCELLENT.  I cannot say *enough* about the DTS soundtrack with this film.  I was blown away at the quality and authenticity of the sound.<br />It gets 4 stars instead of 5, however, because it's a bit too long (3 hours).

B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus emobodies all that is good about music today.  No, they are not nu-metal.  They are much cooler than that.  Their lyrics have an air of sophistication about them.  That is, their songs are not concerned with the normal pre-pubsecent topics that their contemporaries normally sing about (i.e. Crazytown).  Standouts on the album include Warning (especially the live version), Mexico and 11AM.  It is nice that this guys use a DJ as another instrument and not as some sort of crutch like most bands these days.  Further, there is no rapping here if that is not your thing.  They create a very full sound that leaves you wanting more.  If you are looking for a band that rocks in the age of N'Sync pick up this album.  Praise Jah.

B000002A46|2.0|I wouldn't recommend this CD. It's not very well produced and her voice sounds tired in quite a few of the songs. I don't like the arrangements. Think of Hip Hop rhythms and pumping beats and off color lyrics. I don't see this as a Christmas album. Who wants rappers beats for Christmas! Horrendous. I prefer light upbeat melody's at this special time of year. This cd just puts  me in a bad mood.
B00005QB9A|5.0|Stunning! Amazing! Fantabulous! Can't find enough words to describe this film. I love this film and was fortunate enough to see it on the big screen. Tim Roth, one of my favourite actors, was amazing! Giuseppe Tornatore and Ennio Morricone collaboration, to me, can do no wrong. I've seen Cinema Paradiso and that was also beautiful.<br />I heard that the the film was longer when it was originally released in Italy. Any plans on releasing the original version on DVD? Plus, does anyone know whether the song played during the storm scene, where the piano does a dance across the ballroom is on the Italian soundtrack release? I love that song and it's not in 'The Legend of 1900'. I found that there are extra tracks on 'La Leggenda Del Sull'Oceano' and would love to purchase that if that song is in the album.
B00004YW6I|5.0|So why is that ultratalented people like PJ Harvey get so little airplay? Such is life I guess. Prior to this album, she was always on the outer reaches of my musical radar. However, after a few listens I am a complete convert and love her other albums as well. This is rock and roll at its best. Don't disount this as some kind of alternative weirdo music (not that that is bad in and of itself). However, this is plain rock and roll. Being a solipsistic male, I rarely connect with female singers. With PJ that all gets thrown out the window. She embodies a wide range of emotion on this album from the savage Kamikaze and Wicked Tongue to the very mellow Horses in My Dreams.  On another note, her collaberation with Sparklehorse are also outstanding (i.e. Pennies in My Eyes). All in all, she is a babe like none other. In closing, what are you doing Friday night PJ?
079073382X|5.0|Richard Linklater has a knack of tapping into unforced, true to life, real human dialogue and emotions that usually don't seem so effortless on screen.  This is certainly the case with this film, &quot;Before Sunrise.&quot;  The transformation of the characters after they get off the train is as realistic as anything I've seen in any film.  The backdrop locations in  Vienna were shot in a way that really made me feel as though I had been there after the film was over.   This is a gem of a film.    I loved it.
0451450523|5.0|this was an excellent books for children and adults alike. it was a truly amazing, interesting fantasy. This intriguing novel will leave you with a mystical sort of sensation. I recommend you buy or order this fantastic novel now. I loved it.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|I never did like her voice. It's quite nasal and annoying. She has this off key nasal braying voice. I didn't like this cd at all. It's trying to be something it's not, and it doesn't work very well with the R&amp;B christmas rhythms. Not very Christmasy. Also I don't respect her for stealing Celine Dion's song, These are Special Times which incidentally happens to be the title of Celine Dion's christmas album.
0345451325|5.0|For anyone that likes the suicide missions of Starship Troopers, or for those that like the thrill of Star Wars space warfare, or even the kick-ass genetically enhanced heroes of Dark Angel, this book is a definite read. I seriously think that Nylund's prequel to the excellent game is a wonderful stand-alone product. I bought the game and finished it, wondering what was next in store for the Master Chief (Halo's protagonist) when I discovered that his history was in print. Anyone who loved the game's engaging plot should pick up this title to hold them over until round two.<br />Even if you don't like videogames, or don't intend to buy an Xbox , you should still give this book it's due attention. You won't be disappointed.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's Room for Squares CD is absolutely one of the best CDs that I have purchased in several years. Lyrically and musically, this young talent has recorded a near-perfect album. It is one of the few CDs that I can listen to from beginning to end without skipping through several tracks. There is an honesty present in his songs that is difficult to describe, but still refreshing. After becoming hooked on RFS, I then downloaded some of his live performances off of morpheus. His live performances truly show his talent and forecast his promising future. I wholeheartedly endorse this album.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Who knew she would be so popular in the US. Almost over night she became huge after being relatively unkown to the non spanish speaking population. That is so cool.<br />By the by, awesome music.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|To begin, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's slow, it's shabby, it's shotty and it (...). Too much garbage was added into this movie. The Grinch going to Whoville to accept his award made me fall asleep. The Grinch \\"casing\\" Whoville in a disguise was another disaster. The ending above all should have been left alone. It should have ended just like the original. Ron Howard in his infinite wisdom couldn't even do that. All around this movie should have never been made. The extras on the DVD were boring as well. Keep away from this movie.
6305627347|5.0|If you have seen the South Park series on TV then you can relate, but imagine this... the TV series set to a musical score complete with a Gay Devil, Flaming Canadians, Chef in the military, and Terrance and Philip being the center of the plot.  I think I had to have surgery to repair a rupture from laughing so hard.  The movie is basically Matt and Trey at their finest, I have also purchased a bootleg uncut version of this, makes for great fun at parties.  There isnt any reason that you shouldn't own this movie, watch it over and over again, recite the lines with your friends, and just have some fun already... and if you arent a fan, then just go hug a tree ya hippie!  BEEFCAKE!
B00003CXTG|4.0|Ok here we go...<br />Technically this dvd is flawless. Great video along with an array of sounds brings the theatre home, although having to get up in the middle to flip the disc could have been left out.<br />The movie itself is entertaining. As for everyone saying this movie is historiclly inacurate, so be it, that is what &quot;historical fiction&quot; means.<br />This movie would have gotton five stars, but the love story is kinda campy and some scenes appear to be taken directly from &quot;Top Gun&quot;, otherwise, this DVD is well worth the money!
B00000I41G|5.0|As far as jazz guitar on Blue Note records goes, there are two names you must know: Grant Green and Kenny Burrell.  And while Grant's discography for Blue Note is humungous, Kenny did much of his recording as a sideman.  But the numbers are all irrelevant when you listen to this masterpiece -- seven tunes that reach deep, deep into the blues and achieve that wonderfully lazy, after hours groove.<br />  The performances are all classic, from the Latin groove of &quot;Chitlins con Carne&quot;, to the brisk swing of the title track, to the solo guitar of &quot;Soul Lament&quot;.  Stanley Turrentine's soulful saxophone playing is among his finest, and the bass/drums/conga rhythm section is impeccable at setting up a groove.  And the leader provides tasty guitar playing that mixes bebop lines and bluesy feeling perfectly. As far as hearing some classic jazz guitar, Midnight Blue and Grant Green's Idle Moments album are a perfect start.
630575067X|1.0|I must say that seeing this movie for the first time back in 1999 was just about the greatest disappointment in my life as a Star Wars fan. I'm still trying to recover before the next botched episode in this series is released next year. I can truly say I have been a good and loyal Star Wars fan all my life (although I don't give a hoot about all the off-shoot comic books, novels etc. that have come out in the last two decades--Mara Jade--what???), but I can honestly say I LOATHE this movie! The acting is dull and mindless, Jar Jar Binks made me shudder with revulsion every moment he was on screen, I wince and cringe at so many idiotic bits of dialogue and leaps of logic (Midi-chlorians for one--good God!) and empty attempts at inane humor.  The flatness and barrenness of the whole over-produced, over-special-effected grandiosity of this mish-mash is a sincerely disheartening experience. I pray I may never have to sit through it again. Perhaps a five-year-old would approve of the silliness, but no adult Star Wars die-hard should suffer through this mess. The force of personality with which Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and (May the Force Bless Her!) Carrie Fisher give to the original movies, not to mention the clear-cut storyline and heart-pounding drama of the original movies as well, it totally lacking. Not that they were any Shakespearian actors, by my gosh, Carrie Fisher could wipe little sweetie-puss Natalie Portman all over the Death Star.<br />My advise-- stay away from his travesty!!!!!

8478884955|5.0|I'm a high school student taking Spanish as my foreign language. I decided one day to buy Harry Pooter y la Cmara Secreta to help with my Spanish. Though some of the words aren't what I'm use to I still understood it and it helped my Spanish greatly. Many of the higher level Spanish classes are reading this also. For students taking Spanish this is a great way to help with your Spanish. It puts your knowledge to use and it helps you to remember things better. They're just as great as the English version!
B00000JGHM|4.0|This is without a doubt my favorite film of this genre ever.  You got Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore.  Come on?  What are you going to expect?  This film is quite nearly perfect.  Michael Mann sets a perfect tone of Los Angeles with his gritty, yet Hollywood glam style.  My favorite thing about this film is the fact that there aren't really and concrete good guys or bad guys.  Al Pacino's cop and Robert DeNiro's robber seem like two guys who, if they weren't in their current line of work, would be sitting out back by the barbecue on a Sunday afternoon watching the big game while drinking a beer.  This is never better illustrated than the scene in which they are talking in a coffee shop.  The are enemies.  Bitter enemies.  They know just as we do that one of them will have to take the other one down.  At the same time there is this unsaid sense of respect for one another.  Brilliantly acted scene.<br />The bank robbery scene is also amazing.  Possible the best bank robbery scene of all time, it shows such a calm sense of urgency.  An element that most directors would screw up or over display, but not Michael Mann, he handled it brilliantly.<br />This is one of those films where it just screams out for a special edition.  God knows I hope they release one.  I would repurchase this disc for a DTS soundtrack alone.  In the meantime however, the price of this disc is well worth it.  I have nearly 700 movies in my collection, and I still watch this 4 or 5 times a year.
B000002OX5|5.0|THE WHO SELL OUT, not TOMMY, is the greatest Who LP of the 1960's, though it suffered on the American charts.<br />This may be the greatest snapshot ever taken of swingin' London, and it the wittiest and most group-oriented Who album.  They sound like a BAND here, a funny, rough, song-oriented band.  <br />Buy it because it's way cool.
B0000062GK|4.0|There are at least 6 works on this album that should get radio airplay.&quot;ZZ's song&quot;,a simple,emotional piece that never gets old.&quot;Love thing&quot; is a very kool and restrained ballad.&quot;Secret prayer&quot;is also on the ballad side,but it also rocks.&quot;A train of angels&quot;is a reworking of &quot;Summer Song&quot;.&quot;Psycho monkey&quot;has a jarring but smokey beat,and &quot;House full of bullets&quot;is very bluesy.As always,Sat makes good use of his effects pedals and is constantly finding a weird,kooky,crazy sound out his seemingly endless bag of tricks.Its a damn shame his work seldom,if ever gets radio play.It doesn't make sense considering how much better his stuff is compared to 99% of the worthless,stupid garbage that dominates the radio.Oh well,as always the people who count know the good stuff from what the tasteless  masses gobble up.
0790751143|4.0|It should come as no surprise that, after dealing with right wing vigilantes in Magnum Force, SFPD Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan went up again militant left radicals in The Enforcer.<br />When Harry breaks up a liquor store robbery in his own special way, he gets busted down to the Personnel Department.  The transfer is short lived though, for Harry's former partner is killed when a group of radicals steals a large amount of weaponry.  Saddled with an unwanted female partner, one whose promotion to Inspector is politcally motivated (and in Harry's opinion unsafe), Callahan goes on the hunt.  The political pressure increases when the militants kidnap the Mayor.<br />The third Dirty Harry adventure, like the previous entries, had been inspired by actual events (the seizing of Alcatraz by a group of Native American activists and the infamous Patty Hearst kidnapping by the SLA), which, in and off itself, lifts it above the average Rogue Cop thriller.  Which is a good thing, for The Enforcer stands out from the other films in the series for all the wrong reasons.  James Fargo's direction is uninspired, the cinematography is flat, and Jerry Fielding's score (while quite good) is no replacement for Lalo Schifrin's now classic themes.  Working in the film's favor is Tyne Daly's performance, Clint Eastwood's charisma, and some rousing action pieces (including a city spanning footchase as opposed to the seemingly ubiquitous car chase).  Fans of both Eastwood and Cop movies should find something to like in this formulaic thriller, recommended.
B00000JGOJ|4.0|Playing by Heart is one of those films that for whatever reason goes unnoticed, but deserves to be right up their at the Academy Awards in March.  The performances in this film should be dissected and used as mandatory course material in any acting program.  The cast speaks for itself.  You look at the actors involved and you know it is going to be a good movie.  What you don't know however, is that nearly every actor in this film is at the top of his or her game.  The scenes with Ryan Phillippe and Angelina Jolie are magnificent.  Ellen Burstyn, who is always near flawless, gives another memorable performance and manages to pull Jay Mohr up several notches.  Sean Connery gives one his more inspired performances in years.  It is one of those films that you just have to see for yourself.  I can guarantee I will see it several more times.<br />My big complaint with this particular title is that is a rather pricy disc with not much on it.  Now, I know, you buy the DVD for the movie, not the extra features.  However this is a film that has so much potential with the DVD format.  I would have liked to see a seamless branching feature that would allow me to watch the different vignettes all at once rather.  I am sure there is some amazing delete footage somewhere.  And a commentary track by the Director and Stars could have been a nice touch.  Instead all we get is a Theatrical Trailer.  I suppose I shouldn't complain because it is a decent widescreen transfer with a very subtle but apparent Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, but if anyone is listening...make that two disc special edition...you got at least one buyer right here!
B00003CXXI|5.0|Ever have an evening where you just didn't know what you wanted to watch?  Not sure what type of movie or show you wanted to watch?  This movie hits the spot.  I am a 32 yr old parent of a 9 yr old little girl.  She and I love to watch this movie.  I've seen this once at the movies and 6 times at home.  I laugh every time.  It's a movie that you don't get tired of.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Just a note that i am reviewing this film from an entertainment perspective.(That is why we buy DVDs right?)<br />I believe that this edition of Pearl Harbor was dissapointing only to the extent that it was a two disc set and required me to change discs 2/3 of the way into the film.<br />When we review this movie, we must remember that a movie is constructed very much for entertainment. Yes, it is true that such a love story, is quite unrealistic, but it is essential to the movie's 'wow' factor. Without this love story that so many people play down, the film might as well be a documentary.<br />Movin right along, the film certainly does provide adequate entertainment for a viewer. The main battle sequence takes place in the middle third of the film and lasts for about 40-45mins. This sequence, is constructed superbly by ILM and manages to take the viewer right into the action of December 7. The music to the film composed by Hans Zimmer neatly fits the tone of the film, and adds to the sense of excitement created by special effects. <br />Pearl Harbor is a typical Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer film. One that is created merely for entertainment.<br />The first third of the film, does become monotonous if you have watched the film many times like me, but on your first time round, it is essential in building the relationships between the characters. The middle section as i said earlier is fantastically completed and it is here that i gave most credit to the film.<br />The final third of the film does dissapoint me to the extent that i believe it is a poor attempt to sqeeze in the Doolittle retaliation by the Americans into an already very long film.<br />Overall, the film does deserve 4 stars for the amount of entertainment it provides. After a few times of watching it, this might drop to 3 stars as the length of the film seems to drag the story a bit. (the film is a bit too unnecessary long)<br />However, i believe that this film is a good buy especially for those whohave systems compatible with the fantastic soundtracks that it offers (THX and DTS tracks)<br />Also, don't compare the film to TITANIC as many do. When watching a film, really, you shouldnt be comparing it to others. Pretend it is the first film you have ever watched and just enjoy it. =)
B000002LPD|5.0|Following the previous, more poppy and ballad-laden Van Hagar albums, 5150 and 0U812, Eddie and Sammy were ready to concoct a rocker - And they succeeded in creating the most thematically coherent VH album yet.  Coming as it did in 1991, just as grunge was about to dethrone pop metal, this almost seemed to anticipate the more raw, and less sugar sweet taste of things to come.  In a nutshell, the album is about what's good in life, why it's hard to obtain, the struggles along the way, and why it's all worthwhile.<br />From the opening drill sound, the tectonic rumble of, &quot;Poundcake&quot;, implores you to grab life by the balls and get your hands on some of that, &quot;Fine, fine stuff&quot;.  &quot;Judgement Day&quot; is a simple headbanger song which defends the logic of procrastination.  &quot;Spanked&quot;, is a shrewd, honest and funny look at the one-way street of phone sex.  &quot;Runaround&quot;, expresses the frustrations of the real life battle to find a lover.  In &quot;Pleasure Dome&quot;, Sammy explains, &quot;I want my control back, but I'm afraid I'll lose that feeling&quot;.<br />&quot;In 'N' Out&quot;, marks the beginning of the turnaround towards acceptance of the hardships one must endure to succeed.  &quot;Man On A Mission&quot;, is full-steam-ahead determination to persevere.  The tight riffing of, &quot;The Dream Is Over&quot;, wakes you up to the realization of the limitations of life, and the need to put aside your envy and jealousy to make the most of what you've got.  The immediacy of &quot;Right Now&quot;, fills one with resolve to begin anew the fruitful path of proactive behaviour.  &quot;316&quot; is a winsome instrumental for Ed's newborn son Wolfgang.  &quot;Top Of The World&quot;, is the summit towards which the whole album has strived.<br />Whether you're jogging for exercise, cruising on the freeway, or walking around the city, this album is like rocket fuel for your mind when you're travelling.  It's too positive and inspiring to just sit around and hear.  The bandmembers have never sounded more excited and eager to be involved with each other.  There should be a picture of this album in the dictionary beside the word &quot;MOTIVATION!&quot;to just sit around and hear.  The bandmembers have never sounded more excited and eager to be involved with each other.  There should be a picture of this album in the dictionary beside the word &quot;MOTIVATION!&quot;
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best albums to come out in the past few years.  With Popular music on a decline this marriage of soul, funk, folk, r&amp;b, and rock is refreshing.  <br />I do not think that Prince delivered what most of his fans where looking for, but did one better.  Prince supplied us with one of the greatest albums ever.  The first track &quot;rainbow children&quot; was reminiscent of the fusion made popular by Miles Davis and later Weather Report.  Later he showed that he could play like Larry Graham, providing us with a funky bass line on Family name.  Prince changed faces and showed us folk with the sultry ballad &quot;she just loves me 4 me.&quot;<br />There is no doubt that the arrangements on this albums were tighter any pop or jazz band on the scene.  The instrumentation was blazing and the grooves were bumpin.  The lyrics left no stone unturned.  <br />His message was clear on this album:  &quot;Rainbow children&quot; . . .&quot;just love me for me.&quot;   And we love him for this masterpiece and are looking forward to the next.
0881030376|5.0|All the reviews here will tell you that this is a classic and what the book is about.  However, I haven't found a review applauding the author's mastery of the art of writing.  That's what this review will tell you and the others may not.  <br />This book has some of the best examples of anticipation/suspense, climax, resolution, and most of all foreshadowing, that I've ever had the pleasure of reading.  If you want to know what true writing is all about, then you MUST read this masterpiece.  It is a relatively quick read, but one that will stay with you forever.
B000002BFL|3.0|I know I will be ridiculed for not praising Springsteen like everyone else on this planet does.  For me, Springsteen is not a legend, has a lousy voice and is one of the most overrated singer/songwritters around to my ears.  He is a very, very wealthy man who is writing songs about being poor.  While he's cruising around in the Arizona mountains in his $200K 4-door convertable to and from his multi-million dollar ranch in the mountains, he is writting songs about poverty and despair and the &quot;tough life&quot;.  Sorry, but it does not come across as valid.  This album contains attempts at depicting the rough life amonst poverty stricken America and the southwest.  Some are decent enough, some are just flat out dull attempts to write Dylan and Van Zandt-like folk numbers.  If you want since hard-life folk songs, check out Fred Neil, Townes Van Zandt, Nick Drake, Johnny Cash, etc as there's just so many that are way, way better than this album...  Springsteen is an extremely wealthy man who is living the great life and is dripping with money and riches so I don't know why he is pretending to be leading such a difficult &quot;hard-times&quot; life by writting these types of songs.  I'm sorry, these lyrics just come across as being superficial and phoney to me.  For entertainment purposes and such, I can accept this album.  For sincerity purposes, I sure hope he was not cashing in on the emotions of others.  However, if I had to pick one Springsteen album to keep, it would be this one despite it's potential insincerity.  I've always thought he was very overrated anyhow so perhaps this is an extremely biased review.  Take it for what it's worth though.   He never has and never will be my boss.  Still though, this album (unlike his others) is listenable all the way thru despite some snooze parts here and there.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|This is among their lesser albums, but for rock in general, it's still a must have. It's great if you want something heavy yet adventurous on a rainy or overcast day. The tribal drumming of &quot;Everybody Wants Some&quot;, feels like your in some kind of post-industrial, frankenstein swamp land. That's part of the inspiration for the claymation dancing hamburger scene from the movie &quot;BETTER OFF DEAD&quot;. In John Cusack's misery as a fast food cook, he imagines that the hamburger he has constructed has come to life singing like David Lee Roth. It's diabolical, heavy and comical all at the same time. Listen to the way Dave get's cut off by Ed's guitar, the first time he tries to say, &quot;I like the way the little line runs up the back of their stockings.&quot; It has such a sense of spontaneity which has never been equaled by any of the post DLR-era releases. Built on an awesome processed riff, &quot;And The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, recalls the adolescent adventures of VHII's, &quot;D.O.A.&quot; Dave's humourously realistic lyrics, score with dead on social criticism. &quot;Fools&quot;, is like a ridiculous, self-parody of DLR. There's a certain fatalism to &quot;Romeo Delight&quot;, with lyrics like, &quot;High crime's on in the city of light's/I'm takin' my whiskey to the party tonight&quot; &quot;Tora! Tora!&quot;, is an intro to &quot;Loss Of Control&quot;, which simulates a motorcycle accident and the spectacle of such a tragic death. &quot;Loss Of Control&quot;, chugs in like a flashback to the mind of the rider before he lost his life. Again the songwriting is funny and original with a pilot suddenly crying &quot;mayday&quot;. &quot;Take Your Whiskey Home&quot;, further elaborates on choosing the path of self-destruction. In an old-fashioned way, &quot;Could This Be Magic&quot;, beams with outstanding New Orleans flavored acoustic guitar work from Ed, the authentic southern bluesman vocals of DLR, and a great chorus. Roth's on-the-verge-of-laughter vocals give the track a lot of charm. &quot;In A Simple Rhyme&quot;, tries to be a great song, but ends up fairly pedestrian.<br />Although the band sounds thrilled, there is a noticable nihilism on this album, compared to the more innocent VHII. Fair Warning would be more angry and bleak, but with less humour, before the band turned more pop on Diver Down. But the first two songs are among VH's best and make this album well-worthwhile.als give the track a lot of charm. &quot;In A Simple Rhyme&quot;, tries to be a great song, but ends up fairly pedestrian.<br />Although the band sounds thrilled, there is a noticable nihilism on this album, compared to the more innocent VHII.

0385493622|5.0|This required reading for my History of Mathematics class was anything but a chore.  Singh keeps the reader wanting more at the end of each chapter.  The descriptions and examples of the mathematical concepts were written so that a person without a mathematics education could learn and understand them.  The powerful story behind the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is told along with many sub-stories:  the tragic Tanijama-Shimura story, the brilliant youngster Galois, Euler's story, and many others.  Without realizing it the reader gains much knowledge of history and mathematics history.<br />It is a true love story of the passion Andrew Wiles possessed in his desire to solve the greatest math problem ever.  For 350 years some of the greatest mathematicians had tried to solve the problem and they all failed.  This book tells their stories along with the drama that surrounded them.
B0000214F0|1.0|The &quot;Spotlight Review&quot; is dead wrong; not only is Caligula's history pretty ridiculously bloody, violent, and sexual, the man himself went a whole heck of a lot further than this sad little flick does.  The key problem with &quot;Caligula&quot; isn't the violence, gore, or scanty hardcore porn footage anyway (if you're looking for those kind of jollies, look elsewhere), it's that these things were combined in a coldly cynical manner.  This is basically an attempt to cynically rack up the bucks.  Considering Guccione had to rent theaters to screen it, it makes you wonder just what the man was trying to prove.<br />Regardless, this movie really stinks.  The cast does a great job, no denying that, but they just can't win against the mindlessness of the script (poor Gore Vidal, I can't blame him for fighting to get his name taken off) or the shoddy direction.  This isn't even a fun exploitation flick; there's no joy or sense of fun here.<br />You're better off with &quot;Killer Condom&quot;, or most of the Troma flicks.  Or any hardcore porn disc if you're looking for that kind of stuff.  Don't waste your time on this; for once, Maltin nailed it.
B00003CXTG|3.0|The love story plot in this movie is very bad and predictable.  However, the cinematography and special effects in the attack sequences is worth watching.  The movie is depressing, but helps to bring the viewer an understanding of the horrorific attack at Pearl Harbor and its effect on the U.S.  It is especially hard-hitting after the events of 9/11.  The dvd also includes a special about Pearl Harbor produced by the History Channel which is quite informative.  Worth renting.

B00005O5CM|3.0|Yes, this is a typical &quot;chick flick.&quot; However, take it with a grain of common sense. This movie shows how blond and beautiful can be discriminated against just like any one else. With a predictable plot, you can watch with one eye open and still guess the end by the time you're thirty minutes into the movie. I give it 3 stars because it kept me amused and I enjoyed the diversion.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I've been listening to Shakira in Spanish for awhile now and  that's when I fell in love with her music. Her songs rang from ballads to rockers to traditional Spanish. Now with that said on to the first English album which I have been waiting for.<br />I think some of the others who have reviewed the CD are a bit too harsh. Granted some would rather just do another Spanish cd because of a variety of reasons. Yes most Latin singers seem to lose something when they do an English album. If you haven't notice, checkout Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony etc. Their Spanish albums have passion and great feeling, but translating that into English seems to get lost a bit. Dare we say that the Spanish language lends itself well to passion and great feeling in it's phrasing alone compared to the English language. No I don't speak Spanish, my primary is English and I only know a little Spanish. But even with all this said, this CD is a good first effort for an English crossover. It shows her talent, as a songwriter, musician, and singer. More so that all 3 of Britney Spears cd's. <br />I do believe pop music needs to start making its transition to real substance...pop singers who can sing, write, and play an instrument. I believe Shakira is part of that. Basically going back to a time when pop music wasn't man made in the studio so to speak. Shakira is the real thing, nothing man made about her talent and that shows on this cd. The only song I must say I didn't like at all is Poem for a Horse. Otherwise this CD is great and I have a bunch of people who never heard of her listening to this cd and loving it.<br />Shakira will be around for as long as she wants because of her abilities. I also believe her 2nd English album will be even stronger. I would like her to be less influenced by her producers. I think she should adopt her sensibilities that she had on her Spanish albums. As usual with a first crossover album, you have a lot of people trying to make sure it appeals to the Englishmarket.....but you know what I'd like to say to those producers is, stop trying to force your artists into some mold and let them be themselves. <br />Shakira is herself on this CD but there are times you know it was the influence of the producers of the record company behind it. This CD is good, fun, and you will fall in love with it give it a few spins. And for all new Shakira fans.... enjoy and realize the woman is a &quot;true&quot; talent and her lyrics are deep. Which is something we haven't heard on the radio lately. We usually hear about lollipop love. Shakira talks about real love, the way a woman feels.
0812550757|5.0|This is one of the best science fiction novels ever. Even if you didn't like Ender's Game, you must read this. Card is one of the best writers for characterization in any genre. The characters really do come alive - I had dreams about them after reading this book. It's essentially a mystery novel, with the murders of two scientists unresolved until Ender arrives at the colony. He and his AI companion, Jane, find out all the secrets kept by the dead and living by the end of the novel, and then the novel ends on a bit of a cliffhanger. Amazing work.
B00005NTNM|3.0|About a decade before Billy Crystal beat the word to death on SNL, \\"marvelous\\" became Harry's little catch phrase in `The Enforcer', which I consider to be the weakest entry in the entire `Dirty Harry' saga. The bad guys, a bunch of Symbionese Liberation Front wannabes, didn't exactly put any fear in me. Their leader looked like he'd be more at home hangin' ten down in SoCal than as an urban terrorist. The climax to the obligatory final fight scene at Alcatraz was kinda hokey too. And they also decided to bump off one of the beloved supporting characters that had seen action in the previous two DH flicks. I'll not say who exactly-let's just say he'll not have to worry about \\"too much linguine\\" anymore.<br />But, even with these nits, I still find `The Enforcer' to be a passable waste of an hour-and-a-half. Much like the previous &amp; subsequent DH mo-pics, this one features a future notable TV/film star. Tyne Daly, four-time Emmy winner of `Cagney &amp; Lacey' fame, saw her action as a street cop here, as yet another unfortunate partner for Harry.<br />Then there's my fave moment: the big in-joke. Our anti-hero's talking to Big Ed Mustapha, a Black Pantheresque militant. At one point Harry asks him if they know each other from somewhere. What's the joke, you ask? Well, here you go: The guy who plays Mustapha (Albert Popwell) appeared in the first four DH movies, each time as a different character. He was the bank robber who felt lucky in DH, the pimp in MF, and Harry's partner Horace in the subsequent `Sudden Impact'.<br />Now on to the DVD's features. The guys at the WB did a really good job fixing up the picture &amp; sound quality for the DVD release. There's far less crud &amp; clutter on the film, and the new sound mix really gives the gunshots good reverb. As for extras, there isn't all that much- a mini-doc covering the making of `The Enforcer', and a trailer.<br />One final bit of useless trivia: `The Enforcer' is the only DH movie where the soundtrack score was not composed by Lalo Schifrin. Strangely enough, however, one of the members of the bad-guy crew is named Lalo. A coincidence? Probably...<br />`Late

0385505833|5.0|I read this book over the weekend and thought it was great. It really takes a look at the way we have commercialized Christmas. I laughed out loud over the characters in the book and could relate to the way we create stress for ourselves during the holidays. The book is fun, don't try to make too much of it. It is great to read during the holiday season. Make sure you finish it...it will help you remember what is important in life!
B000059ZT4|5.0|I have always felt that the Blackwell-produced Island albums by Bob Marley and the Wailers sound too....uh...produced.  The original Jamaican mix of &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; is uh...perfect.  Stripped of overdubbed guitars and keyboards, the albums' power shines through...as it was originally intended to.  It is the best Reggae album ever recorded.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Incredible lyrics engage the soul while the catchy tunes keep the blood flowing.  Loved track 2 so much I bought the whole cd.  Very grateful I did and would rec. this to anyone.
B00005R8DB|5.0|This is Monk's best studio album....and my favourite. Max Roach is arguably the best Jazz drummer in history (...Art Blakey?) and with Sonny Rollins on Sax, Monk is surrounded by amazing players.  Every tune is great, with a personal favourite being &quot;Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are&quot;.  What else can I say?  Monk et al at their best.
0446677450|5.0|I bought the Rat Race game after reading this book.  Since then I've teamed up with a co-worker to start getting out of the rate race.  I'll be debt free in another 10 months!<br />Thanks!

0679731725|5.0|We can´t escape from the remains of the day. Every single living creature is condemned to look back once in a while and have an outlook of those turning points where we´ve made decisions regarding our existence. Who knows when to recognize when our own lives are, without any reasonable doubt, worthy and true? We´re all intended to make decisions in our lifetime hoping that these will be worthwhile. This is our fate, to live as best as we can  to make justice to the last moments of our days. <br />Stevens is a devoted professional. He inhabits his role fully with pride. This man is only interested in practical issues regarding his duties and seeks to achieve personal fulfillment by these means. He even believes that his tasks can affect the course of history. He feels guilt and shame of showing himself to the world in incidental casual daily life matters.  Avoids anything (or anyone) that might possibly distract him off his duties even in the most extreme occasions.  His efforts to deviate attention on himself are justified by his noble means.<br />But this butler fails all throughout his narration to escape his own human nature. Whenever he´s getting introspective, he tries to hide and justify his feelings, doubts and fears but always too late because the reader is always capable to see through him. He lives tormented about how things might have turned out if he had succumbed \\"just once\\" to temptation. He wonders if he might find the answer while driving across the country. <br />Stevens renounces his \\"own search\\" by living to fulfill the desires of an honorable and noble man. Serving as an instrument, tries to find meaning and bring dignity to his own existence. This is his worst sin of all and he knows it.<br />Mrs. Kenton renounces her \\"own search\\" for a while, but as she decides to drift, risk and find a mean to her existence  she discovers that this brings severe consequences to her. She tries, risks and then looses. This is her triumph and her capital sintoo.<br />The novel makes allusion of the high moral price Great Britain (and maybe Japan) paid as a result of unsuitable policies regarding world war ll. Policies promoted by paternal figures shielded in all noble titles are questioned in the novel. <br />Shame and deep regret for not recognizing on time the challenges of our living moments, incapacity to face reality, being late on making transcendental decisions, all this is part of what awaits for us in the last moments of our days. It is part of the living experience of every man and every country. <br />The motion picture as well as the written novel are not to be missed.
B000001FTJ|5.0|For this album. (Small Change and Raindogs are just as good) These aren't good songs, they're great stories.
B000000993|4.0|This is probably the darkest Tool album in their catalog.  To me, Maynard's vocals on this album sound like he's suffering instead of moving with the music, and this compliments the emotion of the music perfectly.  Songs like Prison Sex, Disgustipated and the &quot;hit&quot; Sober are all about emotion and sadness.  This is the album that got me into Tool, which are my favorite band of all time.  I guess I could thank the idiot that broke my heart and got me to hear Sober a billion times.
B0000065O1|5.0|i found this video to be interesting and fun as well as a good basic workout.  i've done this video religiously for two years and am in great shape.  however, a few of the excercises have become too easy and now i dont always have an hour to dedicate to working out so i tend to focus on the legs and abs, which i have found to be the most rewarding.  the first time you do this video i guarantee you will be sore the next day.  but they do a good job explaining each manuever, and cindy is an inspiration.  a good buy for anyone wishing to tone and lose some extra inches.

B00005RYLE|5.0|If you're looking at this pre-order screen you most likely have already seen this movie and don't need a synopsis. We all know it's a classic. But, we also know there has been a previous special edition DVD from horror video masters, Elite Entertainment. It also happened a few times in the past were the older edition was better, in terms of either presentation or extras. Let me explain to you why you need to replace your current Edition with this one. First of all, you get a THX master of the film, which I don't remember ever being done on this film before. Thank god for Anchor Bay or for the most part older cult movies would suffer horrendous transfers and high prices due to its availability. Next, you get what is looking to be a stellar replica of the book of the dead that holds the DVD. You can see screens of it at deadites.net. Finally, the extras is where this new edition really shines. First off, you get commentaries which are from Elite. You get screen tests of the plentiful gore effects also from Elite. You get a documentary about fanboys, made by Bruce Campbell himself. Another nice adddition is the original TV spots and trailers for the movie, and everyone loves vintage ads. But the part that makes this an ABSOLUTE must buy is the inclusion of Within the Woods, Sam Raimi's short film that has rarely been seen by anyone.<br />Don't hesitate to buy this one.<br />Complete specs:<BR>-Widescreen 1.85:1, 16x9 enhanced, THX Approved <BR>-DTS 6.1, Dolby 5.1 EX, Dolby 2.0, French 5.1, French 2.0 <BR>-Within the Woods - short film starring Bruce Campbell, directed by Sam Raimi.

B00005QATY|3.0|This is a movie that seems better looking back on it than it does while being watched.  Many scenes are stand-alone works of art, visually and aurally enchanting, and looking back on these scenes will make you think the movie must have been better than it seemed at the time.  The acting is superb (not just Clooney, who is great, but the supporting cast shines with only a couple of exceptions), the music is just wonderful (traditional American music, sweet and haunting), and the cinematography is outstanding.<br />     The problem, unfortunately, is that the threads that try to tie this movie together are weak.  My recollection of Homer's Odyssey novel (which this movie is based on) is not that strong, but I don't remember it being a buddy picture where the characters move from one escapade to another with little common goals or plot.  Supposedly the plot is to retrieve some buried money and for Clooney's character to get back with his wife, but so many scenes do nothing to advance those issues at all and are done with such care and spectacle they end up as just confusing.  At the end of &quot;OBWAT&quot; I had to ask myself &quot;what was the point of that?&quot; and I have to answer that the point was to put a bunch of very pretty scenes together.<br />     My other beef with this picture is in how it was advertised.  The studio tries to sell it as a comedy, and while there are some funny scenes and I did laugh out loud a couple of times, this is really an art movie.  Don't buy or rent it expecting to curl up with some popcorn and have a laugh riot, you will be disappointed.
B000059R8Y|5.0|Nice and easy. Cool.  REPTILE is a CD for poolside, for a sunny Saturday afternoon where there's not much to do but relax, listen to Mr. Clapton make love to his guitar while you tap your finger against your glass of ice tea.  Yeah ...
0767853636|5.0|&quot;Annie&quot; one of the all time classic movies of the '80's. They don't make movies like this anymore. &quot;Annie&quot; is a musical movie with a story behind it.<br />Annie, played by Aileen Quinn, is a red-headed orphan who dreams of life outside of the orphanage. Away from orphanage's head-caretaker. Miss Hannagin, played by Carol Burnett. Through some clever nugging Annie is chosen to stay with &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks, Played by Albert Fenny, for a week. Things take off from there.<br />Rounding out the great cast are Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Petters and Geoffery Holder<br />&quot;Annie,&quot; is not just a bunch of song and dance numbers thrown together to make a musical. Sure song and dance is there, brilantly I might add, but as a second element in the movie.<br />If you have not yet seen the original &quot;Annie&quot; movie; you are in for a treat. I for one, can not see anyone else in these landmark roles.<br />If, you are old enough to remember the original &quot;Annie&quot; movie. Here is your chance to own a classic. Recommended!
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this cd a year ago when it came out and it hasn't left my sight since.  I HIGHLY suggest that you buy this cd if your even remotely interested.  Oh yeah, they're pretty good in concert too.
B000000W5P|4.0|Okay, it was the first Stones album I bought (I was 11? 12?) and it's a favorite, especially in light of the three before it (GOAT'S HEAD SOUP -yuk, IT'S ONLY ROCK AND ROLL - tripe, and BLACK AND BLUE - not as bad as the first two) and it does have two of my favorites, &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot; and &quot;Shattered&quot;, but when I want to hear the Stones, I find myself reaching for something earlier, like STICKY FINGERS or LET IT BLEED.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's probably their most focused and complete record since STICKY FINGERS (thank you Ron Wood), but I find it on the second tier when it comes to the Stones (along with EMOTIONAL RESCUE and TATTOO YOU and BETWEEN THE BUTTONS).

B000003BEM|4.0|Coming off the pseudo-psychedelia of \\"Their Satanic Majesties,\\" (which the Stones were TERRIBLE at) they went back to their roots in county and blues and pulled off a masterpiece, despite (or because) Brian Jones was too far gone to contribute much more than sitar on \\"Street Fighting Man.\\" Where as Jagger had been (and would remain) the focal point, this album is where Keith took over the band. But I can live without EVER hearing \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" again. <br />This is a VERY laid back record, LOTS of acoustic guitars and a country-blues feel to the whole thing. Standouts include the hokey honkey tonk blues of \\"Dear Doctor\\" and the joyous blues of \\"Prodigal Son\\", and the beautiful balladry of \\"No Expectations.\\" Even the nonsensical \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" is just playful rather than annoying. And Keith's first solo vocal on record opens \\"Salt of the Earth.\\"<br />Still one of their best and one of the most refreshing of the Stones catalog (see also: \\"Between the Buttons\\").

B000000W5L|4.0|Dirty, sloppy, rude, crude... yeah, it's the Stones in their element, recorded at Keith's house in France during their tax exile year, this is a gritty, greasy masterwork, but even the Stones can't keep it up for four FULL sides. The album bogs down on what was side three of the vinyl, most notably &quot;Turd on the Run,&quot; &quot;Ventilator Blues&quot; and &quot;I Just Want to See His Face.&quot;<br />Having said that, it's still a great rock and roll record.
B00005O5CM|5.0|&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is a poppy pink chick flick and a Must See for those who love fluffy movies like &quot;Clueless&quot; and &quot;Bring it on&quot;.<BR>Reese Witherspoon does an amazing job in playing Elle Woods, a Delta Nu Sweetheart and Homecoming Queen, who decides to attend Harvard Law in order to get her boyfriend back. The way she handles this is hilarious, and you'll see that being blonde doesn't automatically mean you're stupid. <BR>I highly recommend this movie if you want to have a good laugh.
B000000W5F|4.0|Tracks from as far back as the Mick Taylor era (that's partially why there are no player credits) the idea of an album of Stones &quot;also rans&quot; makes one shudder... remember METAMORPHISIS? However, this is a very good, cohesive album. Okay, there's a couple of songs on the second side that could have stayed lost. Still worthy, even if it does have the overplayed &quot;Start Me Up,&quot; becuase it has Keith's &quot;Little T&amp;A.&quot;
B000002B1M|5.0|This is Nas' second album \\"It was written\\" and as probably averyone agrees, it's not an \\"Illmatic\\" but I can't believe all those people who've rated this album low 'cause of that! I give this album 5 stars 'cause it's still a classic... For instance, take Jay-Z or any other MC and take out his best album and compare it to this, I'm sure of it that this cd is still better than all that other! Nas' lyrics are real, on all his albums, and they always will be real and I'm sorry to all Jay-Z fans out there but I can't say Jay-Z is real... Anyway, back to this album, This album is still thight and the best tracks are \\"The message\\" of course, \\"Street dreams\\", \\"Take it in blood\\", \\"Black girl lost\\" and \\"If I ruled the world\\" wich you probably all know... All the others tracks are thight to, exept for the bonus track \\"Silent murder\\" wich has a pretty wack beat... So people, if you want a good hip hop album, this is an excellent choice, no doubt but please, do yourself a favor and don't compare it to \\"Illmatic\\"....<BR>Still the poet... Still the prophet... Stillmatic...
B00005NWRS|4.0|I have seen other reviewers call this frustrating or not a masterpiece, but I am telling you, this could be a benchmark album along the lines of the Stones &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; or Springsteen's &quot;The River.&quot;<br />Let me say it off the top. I LOVE Whiskeytown's &quot;Strangers Almanac.&quot; Think it was the best album of 1997. Bar none. I love Ryan's first solo effort, &quot;Heartbreaker.&quot; I have warmed to parts of Whiskeytown's posthumous &quot;Pneumonia.&quot; It's just NOT Almanac, and I have accepted that and I can start to view it for its own strengths and weaknesses now. For those twisted souls who don't know Whiskeytown, go immediately and buy &quot;Strangers Almanac.&quot; Better get Wilco's &quot;Being There&quot; if you don't have it, too. You can thank me later. <br />Anyway, it's late 2001 and here comes this sprawling, 16 song (21 if you got the early edition with &quot;bonus CD&quot; (assuming it IS a limited run) like me) set. On top of the first solo CD and the Whiskeytown (rumored to have been a double CD waiting in the can for a year)that makes 51 of Adams songs on the street in one years time. SURELY that equals a glut or quality has been sacrificed. Well, folks, I am here to tell : IT AIN'T SO!!!<br />Adams may burn through bands like a three pack a day smoker goes through books of matches, (And just what did ex- Smashing Pumpkin James Iha contribute to Pneumonia anyway?) but producer/ multi instrumental talent Ethan Johns remains as the glue to all three discs produced this year. They all sound sonically similar, but it's apparent that Johns is interested in keeping Adams interested by reaching for whatever Adams is hearing in his head.<BR> <BR>For example,'New York, New York' is a straight ahead rocker driven by some mad congas; which leads into 'Firecracker', a backbeated mover that quotes Bob Dylan on harmonica; which goes into 'Answering Bell', which, if he has any sense, will be Van Morrison's next single... I DIDcheck and it is not a Morrison song, but damned if it doesn't sound like him (almost... Adams' voice isn't that pure or that deep.) with the Band circa 1972 complete with Benmont Tench of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers doing his best Garth Hudson on the organ. 'Rescue Blues' quotes, to my ears, the style of Elton John's Madman Across the Water,(the album, not that song) complete with pseudo-choir arrangement. 'Somehow, Someday' sounds like a lost Neil Young track. <br />As for the BONUS disc, the five songs here are just as good as those on the regular CD. &quot;The Bar Is A Beautiful Place&quot; is a track too good to be lost on some B Side or bonus CD that not everyone will hear, but that's the way it goes.<br />Comparisons are the easy way out. Adams has a unique voice and touch. Adams quotes his influences without hitting you over the head with them, as the Black Crowes do on occasion.<br />I'll say it here and now: Ryan Adams could turn out to be this generation's Bruce Springsteen. He's prolific enough and he definately speaks as an American voice. Don't believe the &quot;overhype&quot; tag. Get this album.

B000002NG7|5.0|Album Of THe Year is all about coming to terms with things in life (or catharsis), accepting death (and anticipating the exciting ways to die), and then what the afterlife will be like, as well as a few insults against religion. Essentially the general theme of about half the songs on KING FOR A DAY, just different of course...this being done by mastermid Mike Patton, you know it's going to be a concept album masterpeice...<br />&quot;Collision&quot;: Life and death in speed, the old thrill of &quot;live fast, die young&quot; is showcased here in exemplirary form. It might also hold references to J.G. Ballard's book Crash, since it holds the lyrics &quot;Collision, my mission&quot; and that story's theme was a guy crashing head on into Elizabeth Taylor's lemo.<br />&quot;Stripsearch&quot;: About how he doesn't need organized religion to get to heaven, he'll do it by his own means, and seems to hold imagery of angels giving him a pre-access stripsearch (hence the name). Great soft techno arrangements which sound vaguely of Sarah McLachlan believe or nuts.<br />&quot;Last Cup Of Sorrow&quot;: There's more to life than being sad and restrained all the time, basically. The cool thing about this is the inclusion of childish synthetic bells in with the rock, but that's Patton, always taking chances no matter how big or small.<br />&quot;Naked In Front Of The Computer&quot;: I've analyzed this harcore fast number and I think I understand it now--off the head it seems to be about how there are so many things to say even though we don't know anything really, take it one step further and all the various ways to do and say things are within the Internet and the compter, another interesting waste of time. Maybe I think too much...<br />&quot;Helpless&quot;: Like Stripsearch in lyrics, but more poetic, kind of like the classic poem Thanatopsis...it's about the soil, existence, doing things on purpose to die; it's also about getting to the afterlife without help...but he bails inthe end. Great acoustic arrangements.<br />&quot;Mouth To Mouth&quot;: Great anti-religion track, aided by Bunglesque circus keyboards. Religion is a myth passed on through ignorant folk by mouth to mouth, and it leaves you empty in the end, and if it's not one church it's another. Love it.<br />&quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot;: The most popular number from this bunch, once again about death. This sems to be about 2 lovers tossing poetic truths to each other: &quot;Give it all to you then I'll be closer, Smiling with the mouth of the ocean, I'll wave with the arms of the mountain&quot;.<br />&quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;: Funny, unemotional little gem about a cruel girlfriend. Reminds me of THey Might Be Giants or Ween.<br />&quot;Got That Feeling&quot;: Zooming, full life, take the risk, all of that good stuff. Close to the most &quot;rocking&quot;. GET YOUR OWN LITTLE PEICE OF HELL...GET IT, GET IT, GET YOUR GOLD!<br />&quot;Paths Of Glory&quot;: Both the most intense and serious song, centers around the pointlessness of war all because of what man thinks he has to be. Blood everywhere...<br />&quot;Home Sick Home&quot;: Dysfunctional family music, funny in a disturbing way...<br />&quot;Pristina&quot;: 2 lovers dying together, played out in simple rock opera finale whathaveyou bugaloo ererer chords. Great ending to what was most certainly crafted as a concept for the end of a career, hence the name of the album...<br />A definite buy for any Patton or FNM fan.
B00000JPYQ|3.0|For the record, Michael Schenker is my top-shelf guitarist of all-time, the best at combining fury with melody.  UFO is one of my favorite bands of all time, but....For some reason this album feels flat.  Maybe it was my heightened expectation after their great 70's studio albums, but I didn't get the energy I would've expected.  Also, the album was recorded during the period when Schenker was on his way out, and apparently Paul Chapman subbed for him on a good part of this album (although no official credit was ever given; somehow, people wouldn't pay for a double live album with the immortal Paul Chapman when Michael Schenker was UFO's bread &amp; butter).  The sound quality is typical of most UFO recordings of the 70's-complete absence of bottom end (although the highs are crisp on this one).  Think of UFO as an assortment of marginal musicians clustered around a guitarist whose tone is perhaps second only to Clapton's.  This recording, IMO, failed to meet expectations as much as Judas Priest's &quot;Unleashed In The East&quot; exceeded expectations.  The difference here being that while UFO was a one-man show, Judas Priest sounded incredibly tight as a band, with no virtuosos at any of the instruments.  Again, not a bad album, but not great either.  Check out the Force It-No Heavy Petting-Lights Out original trilogy instead.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I guess that Radiohead fans won't be reading reviews anyway, they will go ahead and just buy the CD, so for the rest, I can easily say that Radiohead is the best live act of my life, and the feeling you get when you're there is very difficult to explain. Lifting is the first thing that comes to mind. There is one thing that this CD has that the concerts don't have. You can actually close your eyes and 'immerse yourself' when at a concert you wouldn't do that, these guys are great to watch when they play! For the actual songs, all of them just brought me there, but the final blow was 'Like spinning plates',which just took me over the top. Do yourselves a favour and buy this CD, turn of the lights, close your eyes and press play. You're in for a great ride!

B00005O5JV|4.0|To be honest, when this movie first came out, I really didn't think too much of it. Didn't see it. Then, the great reviews and word of mouth came out. That changed everything. I have to say this people - I was pleasantly surprised. I think you all will too. The radiant Reese Witherspoon gets her first real big film playing Elle Woods, a blonde sorority girl who everybody assumes is just another ditzy blonde. After her piggish boyfriend dumps her because, as a law student, he needs somebody more like Jackie Kennedy on his arm. Not Marilyn Monroe. Elle, determined to prove people wrong about her, decides to go to Harvard to study in law and get her boyfriend back. She must of really loved him. Why would anyone want him back?. (...) Reese Witherspoon is a jewel. Plain and simple. She's as cute as a bug in a rug. She attacks the role with full force gusto and, in the process, gives a winning comedic performance that should win her a lot more faithful followers. She's teriffic. The jokes here are all pretty quick and funny. I laughed out loud a few times. I wasn't expecting it at all. It's a real great film for 'Girl Power'. It definitley has a nice message going. The movie isn't 'male bashing' as has been said. Please. Get over it people. The movie isn't obscenity laced(as stated by a review below). A few moments of the \\"A\\" word here and there, but that's it. Not what I call obscenity laced. What movie were they watching?!. The supporting cast is exceptional. The best being Jennifer Coolidge(American Pie 1 & 2, Best In Show), as a hairstylist that Elle befriends. Raquel Welch also pops up in a very brief cameo. The movie may be innocent fluff, but that's a good thing. Fluff is always a good thing. This is fluff that even male friends of mine have liked. Give this sweet movie a try. It was the nicest surprise of 2001 hands down. Reese, you are a star!.
6304698658|5.0|Since about 1995, christmas at our house jsut wouldnt be the same if we didn't watch &quot;christmas vacation&quot; and &quot;christmas story&quot; about 80 times between the dvd and when its on tv.  This movie is perfect.  I can't think of a single instance in the film where something could be changed.  Teh best of the vacation movies and one of my all time favorite films, Christmas Vacation shows every family that no matter how bad christmas is at your house it could always be worse. If you like Chevy Chase, in his good days, or any of the other vacation movies then buy this now, don't rent, don't think jsut buy.  Even if its jsut for the sleddign scene this movie is worth 14 bux.  Video quality o nthe dsic is clear and clean, but not mindblowing, it doesn't need to be.  the sound is good, voices are clear, music doesn't drown anyone out. ONce again nothing spectacular but it doesnt need to be.  Extras are slim pickings, but there wouldnt be much to put on here anyways.  Even tho thsi movie will be on tv 3468 times between November 1st and December 25th. It is still worth owning as it can be watched year round.  You won't fee lstoopid watching it at other times in the year.  Christmas in July, anyone?
630469654X|5.0|Love, jealousy and magic-- a potent combination in anybody's book; and when you weave these elements together into a story of two medieval lovers (the likes of which Shakespeare could not have penned better), destined to be forever together yet ever apart, cursed by a jealous and powerful man, the result is a romance/adventure that evokes a sense of chivalry and passion, delivered here in the transporting drama \\"Ladyhawke,\\" directed by Richard Donner.  Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer star as the lovers, Etienne Navarre and Isabeau Dante, victims of the wanton desires of a Bishop (John Wood), who covets Isabeau for himself.  And if he cannot have her, the Bishop decrees that no man shall, and casts a spell upon them which transforms them at every sunrise and sunset, Navarre destined to be a man by day, but a wolf by night; Isabeau, by night a woman, but during the daylight taking the form of a hawk.  Unable to break the curse, they are able to glimpse one another as they really are only during the fleeting moments of their transition, and so they live-- traveling the countryside always together yet apart, searching for a way to lift the spell and become whole again.  <br /> Hopeless as it all seems, they go on; and one day a young man enters their lives, a petty thief named Phillipe Gaston (Matthew Broderick), also known as \\"The Mouse,\\" who through a twist of fate just may become their salvation.  Joining them on their journey, Phillipe is able to bring Navarre and Isabeau, if not comfort, at least hope.  Hope for a better tomorrow, when at last they may truly be together.<br /> Romantic to the max and in every sense of the word, Donner presents this fanciful tale beautifully, and in a way that makes it engaging and timeless.  This story is a vision realized, one that will surely touch the romantic in even the most jaded of individuals, because everyone has known this kind of love and longing, if not in reality, then at least in the realm of the imagination.  Andthose who have ever suffered loss or have known sorrow will be especially moved by it.  Drawing upon his own artistic wherewithal, Donner has crafted a film with universal appeal, tempering the romance with just enough humor to offset the drama, while blending it with a dash of action, mystery and suspense that keeps a thread of tension alive from beginning to end.  It helps, of course, that beyond Donner's consummate skill as a storyteller he had a terrific cast with which to work, and with whom he was able to conjure and cast a spell of his own.<br /> There is but one word to describe Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Isabeau, and that is \\"Exquisite.\\"  Of beauty, grace, poise and charm; all of the above.  She embodies all of these qualities and more in Isabeau, giving a sensuous and alluring performance that should have earned her resounding acclaim.  Why it did not is anyone's guess.  One possibility is that it had to do with the decade in which this film was made (it was released in 1985), born as it was in the middle of an era dominated by action movies and teen angst.  Given the sensibilities of today's audiences, however, who seem to be embracing the more imaginative offerings like \\"Harry Potter,\\" \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the off-beat fairy tale, \\"Shrek,\\" and in light of the unprecedented success of \\"Titanic,\\" I feel an argument could be made that this film was some fifteen years or so ahead of it's time.  If released today, chances are it would enjoy a significantly greater success.  Indeed, it may yet find new life on video/DVD, conducive as it is to the tastes of viewers today.<br /> This is certainly one of Rutger Hauer's most memorable roles, and he is perfectly cast as the dashing soldier, Navarre.  Heroic and romantic, this is a character not unlike others he's done (he did a variation of Navarre this same year in \\"Flesh and Blood\\"), but this is the definitive portrayal.  It's refreshing to see him in a role like this, as he tends to gravitate toward characters with a darker side, villains like John in \\"The Hitcher,\\" or the anti-hero, Roy, in \\"Blade Runner.\\"  Here, astride his horse and wielding a sword apparently wrought from the same steel as Excalibur, he cuts quite a bold figure, enhanced by the depth of his eyes and a determined attitude, especially in the final scene in which he at last confronts his nemesis.  And there's a definite chemistry between Hauer and Pfeiffer that makes this story all the more enticing.<br /> As Phillipe, Matthew Broderick gives an agreeable performance, creating a character who is not only ingratiating, but who serves as a sort of conduit, moving the story along while offering some fresh perspectives on the situation at hand along the way.  Broderick lends something of a contemporary sensibility to The Mouse, who is reminiscent of C-3PO in \\"Star Wars,\\" as he adopts a rather wry and amusingly stoic attitude that makes his bemused soliloquies especially engaging.  It's a solid performance, but one for which Broderick-- like Pfeiffer and Hauer-- has never received proper acknowledgement.  <br /> The supporting cast includes Leo McKern (Imperius), Ken Hutchison (Marquet), Alfred Molina (Cezar) and Giancarlo Prete (Fornac).  Encompassing a number of genres, from romance to fantasy/drama to action/adventure, \\"Ladyhawke\\" is an ambitious, entertaining film that has yet to find it's audience-- or perhaps it's the other way around; because it's available and just waiting to be spirited away into living rooms and video/DVD players everywhere.  Which is exactly what it will do to those lucky enough to connect with it, because this is one that will sweep you away to another time and another place, beyond the threshold of the here and now and into that land of enchantment, wherever it may be.  It's the magic of the movies.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This is one of the greatest american movies of the last ten years.However,it was robbed by the Academy.I believe that 'Requiem' deserved atleast oscars for magnificent music by Clint Mansell,film editing which bring inovations to american cinema,Libatique's cinematography,at least a nomination for directing,and finally....how could they even think not to give the golden statue to Ellen Burstyn for one of the greatest performances i've ever seen!!<BR>Her performance is perfect...breathe-taking and heart-breaking...Mrs. Burstyn,Julia is amateur compared to you!
B00000K3CM|3.0|Since the early 80s, writer/producer (and sometime director) John Hughes has had his finger on the pulse of contemporary America.  Responsible for such films as \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" the wildly successful National Lampoon \\"Vacation\\" series (including \\"Christmas Vacation,\\" which to many has become a holiday staple, right up there with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\") and another favorite around Thanksgiving time, \\"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\\" he nevertheless achieved his greatest commercial success when he came up with the idea of having a little boy getting inadvertently left behind when his family goes off for a Christmas vacation to Paris.  That, of course, was \\"Home Alone.\\"  But he didn't stop there.  Some two years later that same little boy boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York City while his parents and the rest of his family go to Florida, in \\"Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York,\\" directed by Chris Columbus.<br /> Once again the extended McCallister family is off for the Christmas holidays, and this time Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) winds up alone in New York.  Luckily for him, however, he somehow manages to end up with his father's carry-on, which just happens to contain a credit card.  And by using the kind of ingenuity that would escape most adults, he successfully checks himself into the Plaza Hotel under his dad's name, whereupon he soon discovers room service.  He also discovers Duncan's Toy Store (to which he is transported in style via the Plaza's limo, complete with cheese pizza just for him), a pigeon lady (Brenda Fricker) in Central Park, and some old acquaintances from back home, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), the \\"Wet Bandits\\" themselves, though now known (since breaking out of prison) as the \\"Sticky Bandits.\\"  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) are frantic in Florida when they arrive and realize that Kevin is once again gone missing.  And with that, the search is on.  Meanwhile, back in New York--<br /> Opting to ride the \\"Home Alone\\" series out as writer/producer, Hughes placed the project in capable hands with director Columbus (who also directed the original \\"Home Alone,\\" and more recently the hugely successful \\"Harry Potter).  This one may not have been a stretch for him artistically, especially since the characters had been previously established in the first one, but comedy of any kind can be touchy, as it is such a purely subjective arena, and Columbus does a good job of keeping the story on track (for the most part) and moving it right along.  Wisely, the filmmakers chose to proceed on the assumption that everyone had seen \\"Home Alone,\\" and therefore waste little time setting things up.  Instead, they contrive to get Kevin posthaste to New York -- where the story really begins-- and even if you haven't seen the first one this will work for you, because this, as they say, isn't brain surgery.<br /> Even so, it's a fairly uneven film.  There's a few laughs in the rush and flurry of getting Kevin to the Big Apple, but at that point Culkin is expected to carry the film, and quite frankly, left alone (no pun intended) it's a task for which he is simply not qualified.  He was veritably propelled to stardom when he played Kevin the first time around, but now-- two years later and two years older-- whatever \\"cuteness\\" or magic he may have had then is already noticeably starting to fade.  All that aside, however, the truth of the matter is he's just not that capable as an actor, paling in comparison to Haley Joel Osment or \\"Potter's\\" Daniel Radcliffe.  Culkin's timing is poor and his reactions lack the spontaneity that would have made Kevin a bit more believable.  His whole presentation of the character just seems too forced; and the attitude he conveys is more caustic than cute, which certainly detracts from his credibility, as well.<br /> Oscar winner (for \\"My Left Foot\\") Brenda Fricker has a dismally thankless role as the \\"Pigeon Lady\\" who connects with Kevin in the park.  With her character, Hughes and Columbus are obviously attempting to recapture the poignancy of the Culkin/Roberts Blossom \\"church\\" scene in the original (which worked very well); but Fricker's heavy-handed dramatics, combined with Culkin's aloof response to her, is almost too embarrassing to watch.  And the sight of Fricker standing statue-like in the park while pigeons come to roost on her head and shoulders is neither comical nor touching, but ridiculous.  In Fricker's defense, it wasn't entirely her fault; she was simply given material that didn't work and a part that was a no-win situation from the beginning.<br /> The only thing that really saves this picture at all is, without question, the slapstick antics of Marv and Harry.  When they at last engage in battle with Kevin (and you know it's coming), it's more violent than the Road Runner cartoons it emulates, but manages to produce some out-and-out, over-the-top, bona fide belly laughs.  Because-- forget everything else-- these two guys are dumber than a sackful of hammers, and Columbus successfully milks it for all it's worth and then some.  A warning to kids, though:  These buffoons are professionals; do not try this stuff at home.<br /> The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Concierge), Dana Ivey (Mrs. Stone), Rob Schneider (Cedrick), Devin Ratray (Buzz), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Kieran Culkin (Fuller), Eddie Bracken (Mr. Duncan) and Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank).  Culkin may be the \\"star\\" of this show, but without the talent they surround him with, \\"Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York\\" would've had to be retitled \\"Lost at the Video Store,\\" with a shelf life of about two minutes before disappearing altogether.  As it is, thanks to some cunning maneuvers by the filmmakers, this one at least provides some passable entertainment and a few good laughs.  For a satisfying evening at the movies you could certainly do worse than this; but you could do much better, too.
014028009X|3.0|A bestseller indeed, but nowhere near the Booker Prize shortlist. Light and airy tale of single woman in London and her wacky friends and family. Amusing, entertaining, and completely vapid. I wish I'd seen the movie first.

B00005LOUP|2.0|My husband and I were both disappointed with this.  We like Jim Carey and did not think he was very funny in this one.  Trying to stretch a 30 minute cartoon that was perfect the way it was does not make an entertaining feature.
0671042858|5.0|Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is, I think, the first Stephen King book I've read.  It takes place on the Appalachian Trail.  Somehow, King gets into the mind of a small girl who accidentally gets lost in the woods when she goes off the trail to go potty.  She keeps walking along the river and gets extremely far from the boundaries of the search party, which has been started for her. What keeps her going is her favorite baseball player, Tom Gordon; she keeps her radio close to listen to his games and wish he were there to help her.  King keeps us as scared as the little girl when a creature begins to follow her, and leaves its traces of carnage.  She finally begins to lose her mind and really believe Tom Gordon is there with her.  You get scared for the little girl just by reading it. \\"Shadows were too black, and when a breeze stirred the trees, the shadows changed in a disquieting way.  Something twitted in the woods, seemed to choke, twitted again, and was silent...\\"- it keeps you on edge the whole time you're reading it, hoping the girl comes out okay.  You don't see too many books out there with this theme, though almost everyone has a \\"lost\\" experience as a child. I think this would be a great book from anyone of almost any age, from small children, who can relate to the girl, to teens, to adults.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is a truly entertaining movie.  The good guy wins, gets the girl and its truly funny and moving at the same time.  Thumbs up! Kids and adults alike will enjoy.  No violence, nothing inappropriate, a classic fairy tale with a modern twist from voices like Eddie Murphy.
0618002243|5.0|A Review by Jake<br />When I first got this book, I didn't think I would like it at all, because it was so long. Boy was I wrong.<br />This book has so much description, it is unbelievable. It makes you want to start talking and writing with more description. \\"In such an hour of labour Sam beheld Mt. Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of Ephel Duath from those who climbed up the path from the west, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched in blood.\\"<br />This is a great story about good vs. evil, Where an unlikely hero is asked to do the unthinkable..... Save the world from an unimaginable evil.<BR> <BR>This is a great story, and I think that J.R.R. Tolkien did a great job with the writing of this story. It makes you want to travel to middle earth to take part in the adventure.
B000002C2E|5.0|&quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; has to be one of the most depressing albums ever made. Up there with Joy Division's &quot;Closer&quot; and out does his own &quot;Blood On The Tracks.&quot; Dylan isn't just crying about Sarah or mad at the world here. His sick and tired of himself and can't get no peace. I find it a bit errie that I can relate to this album and I'm not even 21 yet. The album opens with the killer &quot;Love Sick&quot; that is Hank William's &quot;Love Sick Blues&quot; ten times bigger emotionally. &quot;Standing In The Doorway&quot; beats &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Buckets Of Rain&quot; for most depressing Dylan song of all time. &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; is an instant classic. &quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot; is a tender moment on the record and &quot;Highlands&quot; is like an updated version of &quot;Desolation Row.&quot; &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; is Dylan's best album of the 90's and would make it on a list of my favorite Dylan records any day. Just make sure you don't buy it if you want to kill your self because you probably will after hearing this album.
6305949980|5.0|This DVD is great!  The bonus materials included on this DVD are well worth the extra cost.  The two shorts (Victor and Frankenweenie) and the &quot;Making of...&quot; are all worth the time to watch.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor gets a lot of flack...why??  It basically did what it was intended to do, which is REMEMBER Pearl Harbor.  Plus, if Bay's vision/movie was so bad, they wouldn't have gotten permission from the PENTAGON to use some of the REAL naval boats you see in film.   A lot of people say this movie was computerized, but that is REAL fire and dynamite.  They are REALLY blowing things up! The only real thing that was computerized were SOME Of the planes (cuz they didn't have a LOT of the REAL zeroes from 60 years ago), and the Arizona that sinks (cuz obviously, you can't sink a boat that huge).<br />A lot of people said that this movie was very one-sided, showing mainly American view points.  IN actuality, I was VERY surprised to even find that Bay used at least SOME Japanese footage/thoughts at all.  Remember &quot;Armaggeddon&quot;??  That was TOTALLY one-sided.  So, I was actually very impressed that this movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; not only showed some of the Japenese viewpoints but also, BAY didn't portray the Japanese as &quot;BAD guys&quot; like SOME people have done in previous movies to certain characters.  He simply showed WHY Japan felt it neccessary to bomb us.  Plus, I'm not 100% sure if Japan showed AMERICAN view points in THIER Pearl Harbor movie..(if they even HAVE one).    SO, Bay really didn't have to add that in, but I'm glad he did.  I'm sure Tora Tora Tora however, probably had even MORE Japan view points.  Perhaps Bay felt that since Tora Tora Tora was already good for IT'S aspects, maybe HIS version could be different.  WHo knows??<br />Like someone said before me, this DVD is AWESOME!!  The sound...excellent!  The arial views and camera shots are very much to be desired.  MUCH BETTER than &quot;Titanic&quot; as far as camera angles and shots.  <br />I know this movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; gets so many conflicting views, but maybe that's why it's so great.  It evokes a LOT of opinions from people, which is a good thing.  If EVERYONE LOVEDit, maybe discussing the movie would be boring, but since it's getting differing viewpoints, it's interesting to talk about.<br />~*Pearl Harbor may not be what some call &quot;excellent&quot;  (although, I LOVED it!), but let's not forget the TRUELY most HORRIBLE film EVER made in HISTORY!!  That movie is &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;.  Wow....I don't think I've seen a movie flop so bad.   That movie makes me sick to my stomach. *~
B000005ITX|3.0|&quot;Alone Again Or&quot; is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  So why does the rest of the album fall off so sharply?  Most of the songs here are bland, derivative imitations of other psychadelia.  Lyrics are decent but not impressive, and often pretentious.  I will say two things on this album's behalf: 1) The poor sound quality of this particular edition probably took away from my enjoyment, and the remaster is undoubtedly better.  2) Had Love stuck it out longer, I think they could have become a great band.  This album shows potential that is not fully realized, due to the failure to have completely defined their sound and style as a standout from other bands.
B00003OSU4|4.0|This is the very first DVD I ever watched.  I have seen this movie in bits and pieces before but not until I bought the DVD did I sit and watch it all the way through.  While Mr. Baggi below provides as comprehensive a review as you could want, I also have a few things to say:<br />Cinematography:  This film looks like it was shot yesterday.  I viewed the DVD on a 32 inch TV and I felt like I could almost reach out and touch the performers and the audience.  One of the reviewers below said that the 50s never seemed so real.  I have to agree.  <br />Presentation:  I can't believe that Bert Stern decided to intercut Monk's performance with footage of America's Cup trials and, even worse, a radio announcement talking about the trials.  It's bad enough not being able to fully enjoy visually a  vintage Monk performance (and how many times have you seen Monk without a hat?!) but to not be able to HEAR the full performance because of the radio announcement is damn near unforgivable.  I also wish that Stern could have/would have used the split-screen effects used in the later Woodstock movie showing the crowd/trials/Newport shots on one side and the performers on the other.  With that said, I did enjoy the crowd shots, particularly the beautiful lady shown during Sonny Stitt's set, the beautiful woman with a big hat shown seated during several performances, and the reaction of the audience during Mahalia Jackson's set. <br />Performers/performances:   <br />1. Anita O'Day is so beautiful and her hat and dress looked so perfect that just seeing her justified the cost of the DVD.  And she sings wonderfully to boot.<br />2. It was interesting to watch Chuck Berry perform &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; backed by Jo Jones on drums!  Jack Teagarden was also standing by but I don't know if he played on this number.  You get to see Jack Teagarden watching Chuck Berry duck-walk!  These are musicians who, I'm sure, rarely if ever crossed paths and to see them together was a real treat.   <br />3. Louis Armstrong - Personally, I could listen and watch the guy all night and day.  He does a beautiful &quot;Lazy River&quot; and sings wonderfully with Jack Teagarden on &quot;Rockin' Chair.&quot;<br />4. Mahalia Jackson - Beautiful gospel singing and, as I tried to convey above, you could hear a pin drop while she sang.  The crowd appeared to be mesmerized by her and you may be too.<br />     There were of course many other performers but those I discussed above stood out for me.  All in all, a pretty wonderful<BR>DVD.
B000000W5H|4.0|...sounds nearly perfect today.  To say that you should avoid this album because it isn't as great as \\"Exiles\\" or \\"Let it Bleed,\\" is like saying no one should listen to Beethoven's 7th Symphony because it isn't as good as the 5th or 9th.  The Stones were a great band when they made this album. At least 50 percent of it deserves classic status, and the rest is most enjoyable.  I enjoy Mick Taylor's guitar work here a lot... the playing in \\"Time Waits for No One\\" is hardly \\"pointless\\"--in fact it's quite musical in a way that is not so typical for the Stones.  And \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" is an opener right on a par with \\"Rocks Off.\\"  Fun and juicy.<br />This record, like Goats Head Soup and Black and Blue, deserve rediscovery.  (...)
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a great album, undoubtably my favorite! It's got some of the best Beatles songs ever written,(in my humble opinion)such as A Little Help From My Friends and Within You Without You. The beat is strong, the lyrics are witty, the band is great... What can I say? IT ROCKS!!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Although I haven't seen the original Star Wars movie in a while, I think this story fits nicely into the beginning.  My only complaint as to it's beginnings is it still doesn't tell us how and when the Jedi academy came into being.  That I would have liked to know...but...oh well.<br />Episode One basically begins to show the fall of the trade routes and the rise of the Dark Lord, whom we know will become Anakin's 'Dark Side' mentor.  And Anakin will, of course, be coaxed into the dark side and become Darth Vader.  Right now, Anakin is a cute little boy, innocent and forthright.  He wins a Pod race for the Jedi protecting the princess whom will become Anakin's lover/wife and give birth to Princess Lea and Luke Skywalker.  The actress who plays this role (The Princess) seemed a bit stiff to me.  I hope her role in the future movies relaxes a bit and falls into place.<br />The movie was exciting and loaded with CGI shots...maybe too many shots.  One of the main characters, Jar Jar Binks, is completely CGI and I found that a little disconcerting.  With today's make up possibilities and blue screens, I believe an actor could've handled that role (I mean, look at Planet of the Apes!).<br />Also, I have to wonder when --- or if --- we'll see an early Han Solo or Chewie.  Although these characters didn't come into play in the original Star Wars until later, I think most fans would enjoy seeing these individuals humble (or not so humble) beginnings.<br />The choice for the future 'Emperor' was ghoulish and nicely done (he's a real slime-bag playing the role of savior...perfect!).  Obi-One was also well casted.  And him taking on Anakin to train as a Jedi once Obi-One's master was killed by Darth Maul was well executed (gives some real meat and potatoes to the legend of Obi-One).<br />We'll have to see how the next movie stacks up in the series.  This one I'd give a B+.  Well executed with too much CGI.
0812550706|4.0|I'm not much of a sci/fi reader, but I really enjoyed this book.  It pushes the endurance of humans to the edge in what is required from the young boys in this story, and examines the ability of people to adapt and then create solutions under the most extreme circumstances.  A gripping story, with one of the best twists of plot that I have ever seen. Truly brilliant. The characters are well developed and have interesting dynamics not unlike what many people expirience in their own lives. Definetely a great read!
