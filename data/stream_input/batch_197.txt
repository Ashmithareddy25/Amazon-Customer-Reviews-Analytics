B000T5O87M|5|Smells great --
B001CJSKUK|4|I used them about twice already and I can actually say they are the 💣 my ninja, in fact got my lines up to par !!
B00APPLQ6M|4|The packaging is different, but the product seems  the same as I paid $22.00 for at Sephora. It stays soft on lashes and does not irritate my eyes. The only down side is that it smears more than some brands that I have used. I have heard that it is healthier for your lashes.  I guess we will see over time.
B0002COXDQ|5|I had an incredibly hard time finding a decent barrette for my fine hair.  Most are heavy and slip out, or meant for greater amounts of hair than I have.  Or just bad quality and the clasps don't work or the top is &#34;pasted&#34; on to the clasp wrong.  This barrette is sturdy and good quality. Looks nice, stays in..couldn't ask for more.
B00QL2JJX0|5|Here’s a tip: if you don’t want to use the trays, you can also apply it using a cotton swab or other method, whoever your choosing. Just make sure you apply it for ten to fifteen minutes before discarding. But I use the trays, personally, just so I can keep it all in my mouth and not all over my lips and tongue.
B005H7PZ2E|1|This product does not do what it claims. It has a nice spicy, clove flavor -  smells of Thanksgiving-time. But other than that, it's just another gloss. Don't waste your money trying to get fuller lips with this product.
B00QIY6VKU|1|Did not work at all. Made my dark circles look darker and cracked. I dont think it is a good product for people of color.
B0000YUXI0|5|My daughter was five years old and still sucking her thumb constantly.  Nothing else we tried had worked and the dentist wanted us to buy a $350 appliance that \\"sometimes helped.\\"  We put Mavala on her thumbS (she was ambi-suckerous) and from day 1 she never sucked again.  The best part is that she is SO proud of herself, the worst part is we have to buy her that trampoline now that we've been bribing her with for the last two years!
B001ECQ53E|5|I switched from regular Degree deodorant to Clinical Protection because I felt like the one I was using just wasn't cutting it. Clinical Protection lasts all day and has yet to fail me.
B00K6DD9G8|5|Have been pleased with these.
B00HLZBY6G|5|Great for a finishing touch! Good quality
B00P6KJ67M|5|This is one of a kind product that every woman should use in her daily life. It is refreshing, energizing, and will make your skin glow. What a wonderful way to start your day!
B000FDCXPM|5|This product really works to clear up your skin.
B006W2SYI0|5|I bought this for my son. He says it's absolutely perfect.  He loves it.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00016XJ4M|5|Love it!!!!!!!
B00BM6073G|5|This was recommended by another COPD patient, my husband uses it daily and it reduces the dryness from oxygen therapy.
B00AXRTO02|5|Very elegant and durable.
B005XSZS92|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B001ET76GW|5|this is by far the best body lotion i've ever used. i have very sensitive skin and this lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist. i told him that i didn't want to use it because i can't pronounce any of the ingredients (i'm all about organic and 100% natural) but he assured me that those are all things that our skin needs. so i decided to give it a try. BEST decision i've ever made for my skin. this doesn't give me a glow and it doesn't have the nice cucumber/vanilla/etc smell that the other lotions have but what it DOES do is it makes my skin look healthy.
B00KCTER3U|5|I got the chance to try out this fantastic Age Defying Moisturizer and I have to say it really stood up to Insta Naturals products.  I have combo skin and it’s sensitive so when I find a moisturizer that works for my skin I just have to yell it from the roof tops.  This one was a lighter moisturizer it did not leave my skin greasy at all.  It soaked right into my skin and just left it feeling softer and looking better.  If you have sensitive skin like me it is best to only use most moisturizers at night.  If you have dryer skin use it morning and night to keep your skin from drying out.  The only thing I would change about this product is the wording on the bottle.  I have pretty good eye site but the white writing on the light yellow back ground was even a little hard for me to read.  Other than that this product was fantastic.  I love the pump top.  I always hate sticking my fingers in a jar.  This product was fantastic and I could see a different in my skin after just using it for a week.<br /><br />I have had the chance to try out quite a few of inst naturals products and I have loved every single one. Insta naturals has a wide range of beauty products.  For your every day needs or even for specific needs.  You are sure to find what you are looking for here.  Their prices are great and you will really get a lot for your money.  I would suggest insta naturals to everyone.
B007U9799O|3|Fast shipping, beautiful colors,but it wont last all dat
B000P9CN5Q|4|The dye is alright it's not the best but not the worst. I guess I prefer Adore hair dye it's way cheaper than this and works 10x better
B001KYQ4XC|5|I love it.  Takes care of shine immediately.  Evens out skin tone, get's rid of redness.  Looks very natural and I can wear a lot less make up.
B002BAOMAG|5|The best natural deodorant I have found... And I've tried them all!
B004J1TUOI|5|I purchased the Proclaim shampoo and conditioner and love them both. I have very thick hair and the conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable. I wash my hair every other day, but don't really need to wash it as often after using this product. The scent lingers for more than 3 days. I will continue to purchase this brand.
B004Y9H1QO|5|I bought this product before, and I really enjoyed it. It was the right lip balm for me. I wouldn't leave the house without it. My lips felt and stayed smooth. I'm happy I found this a little cheaper on Amazon, and I can't wait until my new one ships out. It works as intended. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a reliable lip-balm
B001PNQEPQ|5|I want to try all of them ! I've tryed many lip balms but this is so buttery soft and is very present ,put over long lasting lipstick it was perfect! Highly recommend!😁
B003VMZHKM|5|I stumbled across this product on Amazon and had to get the supplies and give it a try.  I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol.  I also bought  a 9 watt lamp instead of initially shelling out over $100 for the 36w and above.  I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase.  Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don't have to shell out the money anymore for one.  I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails. I clip my cuticles, file the nail, buff away the calluses on my feet, and then start the Gelish process.  The only difference is that since I have the 9w lamp so I do 10 minutes instead of the 2 they suggest.  It turns out perfect.  I just bought 2 more colors.  Pink Smoothie and Red Roses.  If you want my opinion on the color.  I think it is pretty close to the picture shown and quite pink in my opinion, but to each their own.
B0017WGHRU|4|It's just one of those timeless scents that's bee around for ever. Even my dad used it. It doesn't stand up to the aussie heat sometimes I have to say, so they could work on that, hence only 4 star.
B002QF4UYY|5|Gentle on hair, and no tangles!  I love it.  I have very fine hair, and this is the best ever
B0017ZECA6|4|After reading the benefits of using a classic safety razor, and being frustrated by the continually rising costs of modern razors, I made the switch, purchasing these along with a Merkur razor.  These are an exceptional value, having sufficient quality at a great price.  They provide a good shave, and they last longer than expected.
B007S69QAY|1|Item was returned
B00CP7BYPG|2|This stuff is ok. Won't buy again. Not much of a difference. Smell isn't bad.
B0018BTDR6|5|😎
B000PV8O9S|3|The grey hair needs something else to cover it.  especially by my temples.  Next time, I'll follow up with the surya cream on my temples and see if it looks better.
B000K73C4O|5|One of the freshest most amazing scents. Have used it for years and I am a repeat buyer whn I run out.
B001P4EM3G|1|I think it doesn't work or the product I bought is not right.
B000ELYIVM|1|I had a bite guard from my dentist which I ground down to pieces. They are pretty pricey to replace (around $300) so I figured I should try a more economical replacement...a complete waste of my money. This item was bulky, uncomfortable and did nothing to help my night teeth grinding. If you are a serious teeth grinder, save your money and go to your dentist.
B001T8W6SQ|5|As expected - good product.
B00HB2ARHQ|5|Excellent purchase, excellent seller
B00GE5GLQC|5|They fit well and look good with quiet a few clothing. It is different from other bracelets and I get quiet a few complements when I wear them.
B008FOV6NI|5|UPDATE my original post below was done on 8/19/2015 when I got the hair and my post now 8/21/2015 are my results after making the wig the same day. The hair was a dark 1B (not quite jet black) when I got it so when I washed the hair with my Silk Elements Silky Neutralizing Shampoo a black die was coming off the hair. So I washed it twice until the water ran clear. Then I deep conditioned the hair for 1 hour with a combination of the Silk Elements Deep Nourishing Conditioner and the Silk Elements Megasilk Olive Moisturizing Creme. I got a little bit of shedding after the wash and condition with is normal. I let the hair air dry and I sewed the hair (all 4 bundles) to a wig cap and used a lace closure to complete my wig. I got no shedding after the installation as I sew the tracks using the flip over method and do no cut my wefts. I then flat ironed the hair on the highest heat setting using my Silk Elements Megasilk Olive Heat Protection Spray. The only thing I will say is the ends are a bit thin so I trimmed the end about 1 inch and this hair is everything yall. It's softer than when i originally got it. I have wore the wig out and the hair is still laid. I got some wind action and this hair was flowing and falls right back into place. I will still give this hair 5 stars because of the price and if you take good care of your hair like i do then this is worth the money. I used a curling wand on the wig this morning and this hair and these curls i have are giving me every bit of life. This hair curls great and with a little bit of my Garnier Fructis sleek and shine vilumizing holding spray these curls are full and bouncy. As a stylist I like to try all types of human hair from inexpensive hair to really expensive hair. My clients range in what they can afford. Some can afford $150 per bundle and some can not so this is great affordable hair that I recommend. I just wanted to give a full updated on my experience with this hair. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair today in the salon. when i told them this hair was $80 for 4 bundles nobody believed me. Its all about what you do with it.<br /><br />OMG!!!! OMG!!! OMG!!! I was really skeptical about ordering this Peruvian hair because of the mixed reviews. I bought 4 bundles (2/16in and 2/18in) and I ordered thru Amazon Prime and got it the next day and let me just say this hair is EVERYTHING!!! I don't know where these negative reviews are coming from. Maybe its the vendor that sent the hair I don't know but Amazon did that. I just opened the hair and was so shocked and surprised of the quality of this hair especially for it being so cheap. Cheap and Quality usually don't mix when it comes to hair but BAYBAY!!! This hair is soft and has a very light airy feel. The wefts are great and I ran my hand thru each bundle about 15 times and I got NO SHEDDING. The only down side is the hair has a bit of a smell to it, which is common, nothing a neutralizing wash and deep condition can't fix. I usually wear 14 inch but when I saw the price I had to give it a try. Maybe its the luck of the draw but this hair is GREAT!!! I will being using all 4 bundles of this hair and a 12in brazilian closure from Helen Hair. I am more than happy I took the chance and purchased this hair.
B002ZF5J2M|5|I am always sceptical of these kind of products but I can't afford plastic surgery so I gave it a try.  I have been using it  for about 2 months and I think it is working.  My whole face looks thinner (with no weight loss I'm sorry to say) and my side view is better.  I use the product twice a day and follow the directions closely.  I think if you buy this product you will be pleasantly surprised after a couple of months.  I plan to keep using it. I am 57 years old and had that sagging neckline thing going on.
B00MFWM1YO|1|Bad quality
B0012QSZJ4|5|same with the other lipgloss i ordered..really good lipglosses but too spendy...the colors are great though..and lots of choices too
B008HCVNCW|5|Awesome product at an awesome price.
B00526IQ62|3|I bought this as a replacement for my other epilady which i had for 7 years or so and it worked great.  This one seems less effective.  don't know if it's because it's a narrower blade face or what .. but i should've gone with the upgraded model .
B00D5TB1LK|4|Even though it wasn't the original,  it was a great selection.  It did the job and my make up lasted for hours.  I would definitely purchase it again.
B00A2SYKT2|3|It works well, for a skin lightening product, would recommend, but had to mix it with another product to prevent it from breaking out my face.
B0018NSYU6|5|Smells great that's all I can say
B009FIF2DS|5|Love them!
B008HV3VU0|5|This product delivers everything it claims!  Just beware - even though one write up says to leave it on overnight for more dramatic results, I wouldn't suggest doing that the first few times you use this creme.  I kept it on for an hour and ended up with a (forgive the pun) face that stung for a few hours!<br />Highly recommended if you use with care !!!
B002U7BU0A|3|Is great, but the gold color looks almost greenish/dark greyish when put on.  I would have liked it to be more \\"gold.\\"  Also, every time I wear it (once every 6 months or so), one of my eyes gets messed up.  I wore it a few days in a row two weeks ago, and have been dealing with a bump inside of my lower eyelid now for weeks.  Same thing happened to me when I wore it several days in a row last year.  It doesn't happen with other shadows, just this one.  I guess I have a reaction to it.
B009XY1SKK|5|AMAZON MADE UP FOR MY MISUNDERSTANDING, KEEPING ME A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND A LOYAL CUSTOMER
B007ROD3AG|4|This drier is perfect for what I need.  I can now dry my hair in 10 minutes by just sitting there, instead of 40 minutes with a hand held drier.  It has a temperature control and a timer, but it does not have a switch to control the wind speed, as was listed in the description.  The speed control switch was even on the diagram that came packaged with it, but it was not on the drier.  Despite this, I am keeping the product and am very happy with the results I am getting.  One thing to note is that there is some assembly required for the stand, and there were no instructions included.  I managed to put it together just using the diagram, but if this is not your strong point, enlist help.
B00869TU7Q|5|I really like this - a bit pricey so I use it once a day in  place of my regular tooth paste.
B002HWS9FW|4|Works really well - and has a two minute timer which I like.
B00N6TL1DC|5|Excellent product, especially for those slightly stuffy nights that would normally force me to use a full face mask instead of my beloved pillows. Highly recommend you try it.
B004E5PJE4|1|These extension were especially thin towards the ends.  They're so cheap that the attachments that held the clips won't even bend enough to follow a straight hair line.  They are shaped into a U that won't properly straighten out.  I bought these as fillers due to not having enough extensions already.  They did not blend well at all with my higher end extensions previously bought at Sally's.  I also tried to dye them with hair dye, but they didn't change any color.  I haven't returned them because they're not even worth the time.
B0067F8BBM|1|When I use the brushes, pieces of them are left on me face or eye lobs
B0075X0Z46|1|I got exactly 2 uses out of it before it died.  Last used it 2 weeks ago, went to turn it on today and it was dead as a doornail.  Changed batteries, tried various positions, just totally dead.  Complete waste.
B0028RC5N8|4|I like the product a lot. It goes on easily and covers well - makes a great base for eye shadow. My only negative - which keeps it from being five stars - is that I find the bent applicator difficult to use. I would prefer a tube with the ability to just squeeze out the right amount.
B000FTIY4U|5|KISS MY FACE SOAP-excellant and so great for the whole body-during this long winter that we have had    they should ship packaged together and not allowing it to toss in the box, as it chips the soap
B006UET6YG|5|I wrote a review for another color of this type of eyeshadow and again, a little goes a long way. You just need to dip your finger in a little and it goes on perfect. Its a great sheen and is not too much or overdone. Wore this to a wedding and looks great!
B00009RF1E|2|This is the second BEARD trimmer that I have purchased from Amazon that was advertised as a beard and mustache trimmer - except neither this one or the other one I wasted my money on - are meant to trim mustaches.  If you go to Wahl's website you will clearly see that this product is meant for beards only.  Thus - more money spent on my part getting this back to Amazon whose fault it was that it was mislabeled.  I am truly irritated and will not be purchasing these types of items on Amazon again.
B00GW51V0A|4|Is nice
B000YHSZ2E|5|This shampoo and conditioner has helped strengthen my hair, its a great product and its great for daily use!! My hair never feels weighed down, and the price is perfect for the amount you get!
B000MN63CO|5|great item
B009D3G1F8|1|I am very disappointed with my purchase. I took it to a forever flawless store and they told me it was fake. They have a hidden serial number or marking on the product and packaging. This product had neither. Then I compared this product to the same one in the store. They smelled, looked, and felt different. Please ask yourself --- do you really want to take a chance with stuff you are putting on your face?! Cheap is expensive. Go to forever flawless store to buy the real thing.
B002HWS9FW|5|This toothbrush has lasted over a month with rechargeable Energizer batteries I put in. I prefer this now over the rechargeable brush I have that plugs into the wall. So distracting and clumsy to have the brush with a cord by sink. It doesn'tmake sense anymore to buy an $80 electric brush when the $10 does the same job. Just invest in rechargeable batteries.
B005CHEFSY|3|This nail polish chips after only a few days. I would choose Sinful Colors brand over Sally Hansen any day.
B0069SQVK0|5|Very very close to thieves product - which I found was TOO expensive.  I use this in a school classroom and the kids love it too.  Assistnt teachers who amble into the classroom invariably comment on the wonderful aroma!  I am not sure if it helps health wise, but it can't hurt either.
B00AOYDTJG|1|The top was less than a 26 with a size b cup. I was expecting something that was close to the american size standards. If you are a 28 a in Amrican bra size buy an extra large! The company gave me a 5.00 refund. I am still trying to find an anorexic friend with implants to fit this.
B0030HSBGA|5|Great toothbrush for little ones who don't like to brush for very long.
B000C1W38O|5|Love this stuff. Always come back to it.<br />The ladies love it!!!
B000NL0T1G|3|The razor is of good quality, solid, and well constructed.  I was surprised that I had to remove the entire top of the razor - head is threaded on to the handle - to install the razor blade.  Will need to use caution when replacing the blade and hold with a cloth to keep fingers away from the blade.  It is supposed to be long-handled but the handle is actually shorter than the atra style I was replacing.  The regular length must be really short.  As for the shave -- seems good and shaves as close as a twin blade razor.  Not better.  Shaving is slower until I get used to this unit but then it's not a race.  As I have a mustache, shaving the top and in the space immediately under the nose is slow and very cautious -- this razor is much broader than the twin blade.  Also, I forget that I can use the other side before rinsing so another 'get used to it' habit. Initial cost with 10 blades will still not make up for twin blade for awhile but in the long run (years) it should be less expensive.  Hopefully I will stay with it that long.
B008R3GVN2|1|This product made my hair hard (it was soft before using this product) I trashed it, yes it was that bad for me.
B005UL3LVY|4|I received my lipsticks on yesterday.  I am so pleased with my purchase.  You cannot beat the price for 12 quality lipsticks.  Some, of course, I love better than others because of the color payoff.  I have a youtube review of the lipsticks on my channel.  I will recommend these lipsticks to others.  Check out my video:  http://youtu.be/wDlPsd0f4O4
B000EBOPCY|4|Good product!
B0019ZEVZU|5|It gets my teeth clean with very little effort, I highly recommend it to anyone. Compared to other electric toothbrushes I've used before this product performs amazingly well.
B00B5HJH2O|3|Had was very pretty but too large for my head to stay on.  The brim was also much larger than I expected.
B003X52URK|5|I bought this at Sally's because I was desperate for something that helped get rid of the redness in my skin. I have very fair skin so I definitely want to keep the redness at bay. I use this right after I wash my face, under makeup and at night and as soon as I put it on it has this very nice cooling aspect that I love. It also makes my skin super soft and smooth without feeling heavy and greasy. I have sensitive, oily and break out prone skin and it doesn't break me out nor does it make my skin feel oily. For me it took away the redness in a matter of minutes. I have been using it for about 2-3 months now and will continue to purchase it.
B005F0UH4E|5|love this product.
B008Z3ST16|5|Local stores no longer carry decent real files - only emery board and glued-on sand things that don't work or last long!  These are super and do a great  job and at a great price.  I really need these handy at all times for music playing and generally keeping the finger nails neat. I should order more and hoard them!!
B003U8ESI4|5|This apparently now comes with both of the heads that many people said Panasonic should have included.  I really like this but I have to get used to the height adjustment apparently.  The height adjusts easily, and the readout is great, but you have to make sure it is set to what you want by checking the readout since the way the head adjusts isn't as obvious as my last trimmer just by looking at it.
B008RM6V4M|1|I tried this product so many different times and it never worked! I applied it and showered a few hours afterwards, sometimes I waited an hour another time I tried it I waited 3 and there was no color. Very disapointed
B00BWYM006|5|Great for QWISO hash. Speedy delivery.
B00FZKB51S|5|Great product.  Exactly what i need for mobile device repair.
B007ML9SLM|2|I thought the bowl and teaspoons were going to be normal size wasnt as i espected very small bowl looks more like for a little girl kitchen play set but you get what you pay for so i dont mind too much it will still do the job
B00CK2D75Q|5|This product has done wonders for my hair. It is easy to apply and makes my hair looks healthy and shiny. It definitely has repaired damage from sun, coloring etc.
B0086STYW8|5|And works great, leaves a nice clean scents. And no underarm rash have tried some that itch to no end.
B001G1CTWY|4|Good we are very happy.
B0088AKC84|1|The color was much darker then shown and if you touched it hair fell out everywhere. I can't use it so I tossed it.
B000C1ZDTU|5|it's my absolute most favorite fragrance and i was so surprised to receive it as a mother's day gift.
B0098GCE0Q|4|My only problem with this product was in the packaging. The sheets of stickers are sandwiched face to face together and being shipped in the heat of summer, almost every page was damaged. The decals were stuck to the others pressed up against it. With about half an hour of carefully pulling sheets apart and using tweezers to pull decals off of each other, I was able to save a large portion of them. The decals themselves are very pretty designs and good sizes. I personally prefer medium to short length nails and these will fit just fine. The color decals I purchased from this same company are much larger and more suited for women who like the super long ( sorry, but claw-like) fake nails.
B00I03W21E|5|I love chokers & this is one of my favorites! It's nice & classy looking & the material is perfect! Great item to get!!!
B0018MIT70|4|Big fan of this product. I have always dealt with extremely sensitive skin and atopic dermatitis/eczema. After moving to Colorado I have had to really revamp my skincare routine to compensate for the total lack of moisture in the air. I work in a dermatology clinic, so I tried samples of this and was instantly hooked! The &#34;fishy smell&#34; people have mentioned does bother me a little bit (on the plus side, it doesn't leave behind any discernable scent after rinsing), but our Eucerin rep gave me some advice that has really made using this a pleasure. She suggested that I add a few drops of an essential oil to the bottle. It totally works! Negates the somewhat unpleasant smell AND I still get the amazing, skin-softening effects of this product. Obviously proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin- some people cannot tolerate even the most gentle organic essential oils, but my skin is insanely sensitive and this has not caused any issues for me. All-around great product.
B01118NN30|5|These tattoos are beautiful. They arrived in a card board envelope that protects the tattoos from any harm. The colors are so vivid. They shine just like gold. I've never seen tattoos look so real before. They look like actual jewelry,  and once you get up close are easily mistaken for a real tattoo. These will give long lasting impression! The tattoos are long wearing which I love and can be removed with baby oil but who would want to remove these?  I could dress them up or dress down. It comes with 5 individual sheets of beautiful faux jewelry.  Definitely on my buy again list.<br />Sample provided.
B000VQZHIS|4|I have a knee problem and I found this cane much more comfortable than the aluminum hospital physical rehab cane with the shepherd (curved) handle. It is a long straight handle which gives more leveraged support for your hand over the range of motion. It is also an attractive understated class act cane that is not gaudy, with a very reasonable price. The only complaint is that the vendor does not cut it to desired length but it can be accomplished by a visit to your lumber store with the desired length one wants it cut to.
B0009QZYII|4|Nothing fancy, just some good, old-school men's hair gel that gets the job done. I typically use it right out of the shower, rubbing it into damp hair and then blowing it dry before I apply a little pomade to finish it. Works great, has a light finish, manly (?) smell and gives my hair natural, light hold.<br /><br />PRO:<br />1. A light, manageable hold. Not stiff and sticky.<br />2. Smells more manly than many gels I've used. (This can be a pro or con, depending on your sensitivity.)<br />3. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />CON:<br />1. This tub is HUGE. Seriously. I have a feeling it'll last me several years. Should have ordered the smaller size.<br />2. The smell is both manly and somewhat old-school barber ship-y. Depending on what you like, you might love it or you might hate it.<br /><br />Overall, good stuff. I'd definitely buy it again.
B000VG7GDW|5|Great for dry skin and any sores! Healed up my eczema quickly and effectively, after several other lotions did nothing! Highly recommend to anyone with dry skin!
B0081MQ47C|5|Love my new electric toothbrush.  It really does a good job on my teeth.  Most of my teeth are crowns, but I feel that it cleans them well.
B00GNH6NFU|5|Perfect fit an easy to use
B006535HRW|4|So I got this at walgreen's.  I bought it for the silver and the black. The pink is a REALLY bright pink-almost red looking and when I tried it on, I didnt like it. So if you  buy this, I suggest staying away from the pink. other than that it's really sparkly and I love it
B00THEGVCG|5|I am a huge fan of this product. Once applied your skin looks and feels so much healthier!
B0017OGHAK|5|I've recently named this guy Charles.<br /><br />Charles does a great job holding up my toothbrush as well as greeting me every morning and night. Been using for months now, and still standing strong.<br /><br />Charles is pretty sturdy, but after taking him on a trip, he doesn't close completely. It was probably my fault on how I packed him though. The closing only slightly takes away from his functionality.<br /><br />Charles gets a little dirty where the toothbrush touches his bottom on within his tummy, but is easy cleaned using hot water.<br /><br />Charles is like Spiderman when it comes to holding on to my bathroom mirror.<br /><br />Overall, if you're on the fence about buy yourself your own Charles, just do it. Well worth the buy, and one of my best investments.
B00408QTOY|5|They used to sell this lotion in this size where I work (hospital) but they were no longer able to sell this size. I was elated that I could still buy it on here. This lotion has a very light scent (like orange sherbet) that dissipates quickly, the best part about the lotion is that it is incredibly soothing to dry hands and does not leave your hands sticky or greasy. I am on my 6th large bottle of this lotion and it lasts a very long time. I recommend this for anyone with dry hands, I am a nurse with very dry hands and this works very well for me.
B00ODP4PPO|1|Do not buy looks nothing like the picture Looks like tiny pin drops
B00ABUOEOM|4|Love the hair, looks very natural, the reason why I give it a 4 stars rating because the wig do not have a secure fit. It did not have any combs are elastic band or nothing. I had to buy some combs and sew them in and I cut the elastic out a old wig that I had  and sewed it in. The seller need to let you know up front that the wig don't have anything sewed inside of it to make it have a secure fit.
B002B6BJSS|5|This is the only eye cream that I've used and seen actual results. Great product!
B00CYW5QD8|5|This is an amazing grooming kit for men.  It has just the right amount of items in it that any men would use at one time or another.
B004DH1AXM|5|thank you.
B004D7SZPI|5|This color palate is gorgeous! The colors go on easily and stay on all day. I am a performer and these colors pass the sweat test!
B00OT3PVIK|5|These are wonderful relaxing and great for my skin and totally recommend it
B00F56429Y|1|I paid for this kit and I got a totally different kit with only 2 scissors.
B000BBGS2W|5|Bought this to use on schnauzers' ears and it works great.  Have used a Andis clipper for many years and have had great luck!!!!!!
B000W97M82|3|First off makeup is a very personal product. I found this to be a little harsh with my skin tone. But by applying with a very light touch is seems to be ok.
B00GIXI8K2|2|Way too small
B005CV1JMK|5|beautiful
B000BHL34Y|5|I continually purchase these scissors. I wish they still advertised for free sharpening. I cut my hair and my dogs hair with these.
B00IHVLPLM|4|Bought as a gift.  Item as described, fast shipment.  Thanik you
B006LQ8DLK|5|Pretty....color blended well.  Will purchase again.
B008510498|5|My go-to clip ins!
B000CESXXA|5|I love it its way better then the mastera they dont heat uo as fast and you have a great grip, A++++++
B0056I64QA|1|I had bad break outs and allergic reaction to it. I have used other oils, but this is not the money worth.
B000OP3R7O|5|My son got this and says he gets comments on it.
B000PKYCM2|2|I use a lot of Dermalogica's facial products. I was hoping this deoderant would be strong enough, but it wasn't. It smelled amazing and didn't irritate my under arms, but it didn't work well enough to stop the sweat or the smell. But it was a hot summer so maybe for winter this would have worked, but I gave it away.
B002ZG96HA|5|Good price and the product is quality for the cost. Clear view and flips easy.
B003UH0528|5|I loooooooved this brush, it's perfect. This brush is great for applying foundation, I wouldn't apply foundation with anything else.
B000PI57HS|5|Been using for over 10 years love the product
B00D13F6LG|5|Great long lasting polish!
B002LE8P7S|1|Hello ....<br />I did not ask the black color I asked for pink<br />Why send the color to black<br />If the color pink does not exist Why send the color black
B0001V4VOO|5|This item was a long time favorite of my Lady, glad i ran across it.
B0035CFY24|5|my god the smell is potent! it def reduces hair fall. another great product from india! all natural ingredients! im hoping it will make hairs BLACK
B00BPGH03S|4|It smoothed out my natural thick wavy hair. My hair was not dried out like most shampoos and paired with the One n Only Smoothing conditioner it is an excellent combo.<br />Being sulfate free it took a lot of product to make my scalp feel clean and doesn't spread very easily. Otherwise I think this is the best shampoo I've ever used.
B00BM6073G|4|Great stuff for dry mouth caused by medications. Use it all the time.  I can heartily recommend this product for anyone!
B00JH29K6M|5|Long lasting! So amazing!
B001CH8MIC|5|Good product but one was slightly stained.
B003MJG19K|4|This is a good moisturizer if it does not irritate your skin.  I think it is irritating my cheek and leaving a red spot, just on one side, which I can't figure out, but it does a good job of moisturizing skin if you have older skin.  It could be too oily for young, or oily skin.  It is made from olives, or so it says, so it is animal free, which I like.  It doesn't sound like a very big bottle at 2 oz. but it lasts a long time.  You don't need to use much.
B00ES5XBEU|1|This is a gimmick I did everything they said I Ali used it with the waist shaper it did not work i was an inch bigger I guess this was wishful thinking that a product can make u get smaller without exercise
B0009EXOB4|5|Would be nice if the instructions were clearer but good product. Good price too. Recommend it to any body who needs one.
B00MHGZYPG|2|The plastic cap does not stay on well, and the powder does not come out very well on the brush side.
B000SSDTOI|2|The handle seems to be somewhat on the loose side and the catcher misses an occasional clipping. I had greater expectations.
B00OU17ANK|1|Steam with a lot of smell
B0009L5Z32|5|I was looking for natural soap with the idea of reducing impact in the environment and exposure to harsh chemicals. I have to admit I  was looking for original castile soap but the cost I found was prohibitive for me.  This soap makes a rich, soft lather and does not dry your skin neither leave an oily creamy feel.  It is the perfect balance between lifeguard and dove.  The smell was overpowering only after opening the box it was shipped in. The smell of the individual bar is subtle. It is a fine almond scent I like.  The bars are in the small side and I feel they go fast. However this is relative as I do 2 full coats most of the time I take a shower. The packaging of the individual bars does not disclose ingredients and this may be an issue for some people. They do have a website where they have all sort of info about their products.  Shipping was fast. I took nmt 2 days to have the box in the front door. The product comes with a free return form if you decide it was not for you. I ordered 12 bars first. Since we loved it, we ordered 24 bars. Time will say if is cost effective. I wish the bars were bigger for the price as, again, I feel bars go faster than regular soap bars, even of the same size.
B006O4R3L0|4|It was fine to try but for a few dollars more you can buy a much bigger one. This is trial only
B00006IVEN|5|Works perfect.!!
B00PUMEREI|5|Very nice ,moisturizing, good for skin and hair.I am very pleased with this product. Good for sensitive skin.
B00JZFB13G|3|a lot smaller then i expected but they workpretty good.
B0034KYDU6|5|I really loved the colors in this palette but I just hate that I have to use a primer to get better pigmentation, it's just a tad annoying to me. But the product is not so bad the case isn't very sturdy though either.
B001MA0QY2|5|This product performs exactly as I wanted. It heats up quickly and it is small so it works well on short hair.  It has a high enough temperature to work on my coarse thick hair.  It came in a brand new box with a pouch and some oil.
B0013NB6WE|3|My dentist had me use this while my gums were healing and it was ok,I was still learning the whole process and experience with my new dentures.
B002HHHKTI|5|This product has significantly increased the strength of my nails and also leaves them with a natural shine.  Highly recommended
B004DN41GE|5|Love this deodorant, purchase was exactly as expected
B009TRS2LE|5|Works well.
B00264NW7G|5|I swear by this brush.  It definitely minimized how much hair I was ripping/breaking from a traditional brush.  I recommend it to everyone!!
B004CPQBRA|4|ew
B00B7N82ZO|5|I had been purchasing this item at the Victoria's Secret stores, but they stopped selling it at my local VS store, so I placed an order here.  I love the light fragrence and will continue to try to purchase it whenever I can.
B00LV31TVY|4|Perfect everyday carry or travel brush.  Uncertain if the bristles are 100% boar's hair, but I'm satisfied.  This brush is small, about 3&#34; long.
B0010OP17C|5|This makeup is amazing. As long as you don't mind the wait and you time your replacement orders properly it's way better than paying full price at an approved vendor that supplies Bare Minerals. a MUST HAVE PRODUCT PEOPLE!!
B00121FADI|5|I have not found a better tanning lotion! I have very sensitive skin and have never had any problems with this product. I have been using it for years and Amazon defiantly has the cheapest price on it. I have spent over $60 per bottle in tanning salons. It gives an amazing tan and does not leave you looking orange! I love it!
B002QF4UYY|5|This comb is great for using on wet hair when you need to comb through your conditioner. I have curly hair and like to use a leave in conditioner and this definitely helps to detangle my curls.
B007W7KBPS|1|Not good. Powder does not stay. It goes all over de place. I even git a defected one. Can not get powder on brush.  Disappointed.
B00A7R094S|3|It's not the greatest wig in the world, certainly. It's a little hard to style, not as straight as well pictured. However, it works. The wig doesn't shed, and it's very thick. In fact, it borders on too thick. The netting hardly shows. Overall, it's an average wig.
B00NV6VVF8|2|too long for my skinny ties
B00BUC01JW|3|I liked this product, it's really wonderful, Delivery was fast and the price a bit high based on the size,I Recommend all to purchase this product.
B004ZSUQA2|5|The curvature of this file makes it much easier to use than straight files. It has two sides - a smooth and a coarse.
B000EZYKTS|5|9/8/08: after reading all the great reviews, I thought I'd give this a try. I've used it under my arms and on my legs and I absolutely love it! When I first turned it on, I was really scared because of the sound and the fast moving teeth things but it really isn't that bad. If you've been waxed before, this is no more painful than that and way cheaper in the long run.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />10/11/08: This doesn't get my legs silky smooth so I will go back to shaving for my legs.  I'm not sure if it's because my hairs are thinner now so they're breaking instead of being pulled out by the root... but i miss that smooth feeling. I still love using this under my arms and i've even started using it on my bikini line.<br /><br />I've gotten bikini waxes before so this isn't bad at all. it took some getting used to because i was scared (who wouldn't be??).. but now that i've done it a few times, it's waaaay better than waxing!!! i did start getting a few ingrown hairs but found that tendskin works great for that (see my tendskin review).<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />4/1/09: I've still been using this every week. I use it on my bikini area and it seems that it's not working as well as before. I think it's breaking some of the hair instead of pulling it out because I need to do this about once a week (still beats paying for waxing). Also, I've noticed I get fewer ingrown hairs so I think my skin is getting used to it.<br /><br />Now that the hairs are thinner, the epilator isn't catching them as well so they're breaking. I've decided to alternate this and shaving because shaving is quicker. But what's nice is that my hairs are thinner and lighter so if I miss a shave or don't epilate for a week, it's not too noticeable (doesn't feel prickly and doesn't look hairy).
B004Z209HS|5|I've been using this stuff for the past year. It's great! My skin has shown great signs of improvement
B00EGGJT88|5|It's a biore pore strip for your whole face! Also, it might give you a bit of a waxing, too. Be prepared for a bit of pain when pulling this off if you have peach fuzz. But it's so worth it! It pulls *everything* out of every pore and leaves your skin soft and smooth for days. I'm on my third bottle.<br /><br />Also, be warned that the texture is like tar and you will need to scrub your nails afterwards. I got around this by applying it with a foundation brush.
B004RRH90Q|5|Awesome hand cream
B004Z209HS|5|Love this Argon Oil.  I used it as a facial moisturizer, and right away I noticed smoother skin.  An unexpected benefit was the eczema on my hands also cleared up, since I rubbed it into my hands after applying to my face.  After using a few months, I started adding some Plant Therapy &#34;Soft Skin&#34; essential oil to it.  I noticed even more improvement to my skin.
B00BBR5W9K|5|love it
B006BNFXHU|4|The only reason I can see for this being called a \\"Mangroomer\\" is the colors obviously and the shorter cord than say regular hair dryers.  I nice strong motor and many settings to please nearly everyone.  I would recommend it to a friend, if men talked about such things . LOL
B004C1101G|4|Smells great and the kids like the design on the bottle.  Unfortunately, I won't be using it anymore. I checked the EWG website and this product gets a 5, which isn't very good. I switched to California Baby Shampoo, which is way more expensive, but it has a 1 rating on the EWG website.
B000PXYAL2|5|I've been using a hair dryer and round brush for years. Love the look, hate the tired arms and constant repositioning to get the hair straight in the right places, curled in others etc. Enter the hot air brush: fabulous! Ok it's not perfect. You can't go from sopping wet hair to perfectly styled and dried in 20 minutes.  But you can do your hair well and without fatigue.<br /><br />The dryer has three settings: cool, low, and high.  High is equivalent to my hair dryer's low setting, low is kind of irrelevant & cool sets the curl quite well.  It also has a button to allow you to rotate the barell for the curl. The bristles are short and don't grab super tight on the hair. The power switch is actually pretty easy to navigate. And the unit is extremely light weight.<br /><br />Here's what I like: because it doesn't get super hot, there is significantly less damage to my hair. Also, the barrell isn't shockingly hot to touch, and my hair isn't hot at all when done with a section. Because the barrell rotates, there isn't significant pull on the hair - which causes breakage- and if you happen to tangle ( which only happened because I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing) you just hit the barrell rotate button, and poof! No more tangle & no breakage. What's more is that there were only about two hairs on the brush when I was done - usually there are many, and I didn't feel any hair falling after I was done. Nice!!<br /><br />Now it isn't nearly as quick as a flat iron,  but I can't say any of the above about either a flat iron or brush/dryer combo. Loving this & am looking forward to doing my hair again!
B004SKN8WU|5|Good value.
B000P20TAY|5|It is ok
B00K1M65LK|2|Waste of money didn't work as expected
B00HDWOB9Y|5|Well, I gotta tell ya.  When I got this lipstick, it looked like such a funky orange in the container (it's peach).  I put it on, and the color is beautiful, and I have NEVER had a lipstick that stayed on this long and looked perfect for hours (even after eating and drinking).  Also, this seller is awesome!  Don't hesitate to purchase this!
B00WTWQMQI|3|Not enough power, it needs more speed.
B000VIJ7HI|3|I've tried various brands of benzoyl peroxide and Jan Marini is ok product for acne. The good thing about this Jan Marini's BP is the price, it is $10 less than other brands and you get twice as much. For the price, it is good if you have slight acne and just need something to maintain clear skin. For more severe acne I would invest in a better quality bp.<br /><br />Update: 10/2013 - I purchased this product June of 2012 and still have/had half a bottle left. Well I decided to throw the bottle out after recently having a serious breakout and having no luck with this bp treatment. The reason why it wasn't working is because Benzoyl Peroxide only has a shelf life of three months once you open the container. I had this bottle for close to a year and a half, so yes you get more bp for your buck. However, you'll probably won't be able to use it all before it goes bad.
B00006592X|4|This is my first epilator, so you can guess..I had a bad start. I had been wanting to buy a good hair removing system for sometime, and after much searching and reviewing, I landed on this product. The very first try turned out to be quiet a challenge. I found it  much more painful than waxing. It takes a long time to get used to the pinching sensation. The pain recedes, but it remains till the next day. But the result was amazing. The skin was smoother than I have had after shaving/hair removing creme, etc. The second time over, I felt less pain, except in areas where I hadn't gone over the first time. One has to go through parts of skin many times over, but in the end it was worth it! I also found that taking a shower before epilating helps. It does give rise to ingrown hair as others have mentioned it. <BR>If you are first time epilator user like me, all you need persistence and patience.<BR>Good Luck!
B00CI47UT0|4|Good price for a good product. Happy with it.
B0079R6BD2|4|I was looking for an alternative to Aveda's pricey Invati system, which never worked for me after 6 months of using. I saw this and decided to give it a try. By no means is this &#34;cheap&#34; compared to what you can find in the drugstore, but it is so much cheaper than Aveda. I was shedding a ton of hair and whenever I put my hair up, a portion of my scalp could be seen at the hairline. I hated that! I have been using this with the brand's organic argan oil conditioner for two months now. I still have some fall out but so much less than before. I also have a ton of fly aways growing and that scalp spot is barely noticeable :)  four stars because I now feel the need to wash my hair everyday..which means more product use and more frequent purchasing. I also don't care much for the smell and I'm curious to see how this product will perform when I update my hair color.
B008GRDTX4|5|Easy nail tips to work with.
B00112BTH4|5|This is the only makeup I will use to cover blemishes easily. I don't use it all over my face, just in bad spots. I get a powder and blend it so that way it doesn't look abnormal. I have intensely white skin, so this color on my entire face would look silly, but it does a great job if I use it in certain places in small amounts.
B00AW1AFI4|5|best smelling soap ever
B007MTJREC|5|I got these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them! No frills but smooth and easy to use. Just what she likes!
B009RWVLYG|1|I decided to try this color.  I have colored my hair for years and had no problem.  None.  Nada.  For those saying the bad reviews didn't know what they were doing, I'm not sure what else I could have done with the problems I had.<br /><br />IF you decide to use this, I suggest, at least 3 dark towels, lots of extra gloves, multiple sets of dark clothes, a hose and 3 friends.  Is is best as an outdoor activity.  If you don't want everything to turn pink.<br /><br />I'd read mixed reviews so I was wary before I even started.  I have dark hair but decided not to bleach because of the horror stories I'd read and I've never done it before.  With my luck I'd end up bald.  Before I started, I read, re-read and consulted with a friend whose daughter uses this brand and color.  I read and re-read the warnings of not letting it touch your clothes or skin because it would turn it pink.  Yes, it does.  Everything. YET, they only provide one pair of gloves.  I layered everything in the bathroom with newspaper.  The process time of the color is vague.  &#34;Process 30 min to an hour.  If you have thick hair, add 30 min.&#34;  I have short hair but it's thick, so do I process an hour and a half, just an hour or what?  I ended up letting it process for about an hour.<br /><br />Now the rinsing.  The instructions said rinse until the water is clear.  After 2 hours, let me repeat, T.W.O.  H.O.U.R.S., the water N.E.V.E.R. ran clear.<br /><br />The resulting color was ok.  The top of my head was an awesome Crimson color, but the rest was darker.  In the sunlight, you could see a lot more red. The color would have been more vibrant if I had bleached it, but I wasn't willing to risk bleaching it myself.  For those of you with positive reviews, good for you!  But please tell me what the average rinsing time is, inquiring minds want to know.
B00HDZ733M|3|Not as good as the Wet Brush, but pretty good still.  This one is better for shorter (shoulder length) hair.  My daughter has mid-back length fine hair and the Wet Brush works better on her.
B005HA9ES2|2|I have medium coarse hair and this brush doesn't penetrate it very well. The bristles bent with just a few strokes. It's called \\"The Wet Brush\\" because your hair probably has to be wet in order for it to not break doing its job. To me that's unacceptable. I've had a cheap $5 Walmart brush for about 3 years now which has held up fairly well and I've used it vigorously. This brush looked similar to that one and that's why I bought it. Looks are deceiving though and this brush certainly is built very cheaply.
B00A0J086C|5|Hubby likes it for his sensative face and I steal some for my legs. He is very picky but no complaints from him with this version of Axe. He usually uses Edge gel for sensative skin actually says this protects better without the burn.
B0002DMTV8|5|I love this product , but it is getting harder and harder to find.  It has a get scent that is unmatch!
B000701O9O|5|I have been wearing this for years and recieved many compliments. Not too heavy and not to light.
B009Q1YPVY|5|Good product
B00110Q8JA|5|Nice & reasonable priced.
B0062OHNYE|5|These dont break and i have very tight teeth.  I have no issues at all with these.  I am very happy with these and you will be happy with these kind as well.
B00JEEDSEI|4|good stuff
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|You've come a long way baby.  The shaver is great.  I particularly like to use it to thin out my beard and then shave it off entirely after I haven't shaved for a couple weeks.
B003GC4GHM|5|Bought this for my mum, she has cancer , she loves soaking in this to alleviate the pain.
B001J6O0Z0|4|High quality but too expensive. Half the cost of a new shaver and needs replacement more frequently than recommended.
B008B2Z94Q|5|It applies makeup well, without caking it or absorbing too much of it into the sponge itself. I like my makeup very light and natural, so this thing really helps clear up any excess layering. While my makeup still comes off by the end of the day, it no longer looks like I'm melting and it shines less because the foundation levels is distributed better.<br /> A downside of course, is that it can remove too much foundation and make your makeup too light; but it all depends on how much pressure you put on, and whether you're gently swiping, dotting, or both.<br /><br />As for durability, my current one lasted me for way over a year, and has only a few tears in the middle. The only reason I'm looking to buy a new one is purely for hygienic purposes, haha. I think you you just be careful when you wash it, you'll make it a good investment.
B00NUIY80C|5|This stuff is awesome. There is so much oil in here, great for the price. You can think of a million uses for this! It makes headaches go away, and if you spray it around with water, it will make spiders and bugs go away. I use this to help with nausea. Great product.
B00CJ3MDJW|5|Very pretty, looks great with my long, red hair.  Secures quick up-dos easily with minimal fuss.  Solid yet lightweight design.  A long hair necessity !!!
B004W07G2O|5|I have been using this product for years, and down here in the South the humidity is terrible, this spray holds up very nicely. I rate it 5 stars.
B00S485IFW|5|Love these! Easily clips to my daughter's backpack. So convenient when she needs lip balm for her chapped lips. Now she always knows where to find her lip balm...no more lost tubes of chapstick. Well made and cute designs!
B007JWZL3I|2|This product did not work for me.  It is very gluey and it also gets all over the skin.  It is very obvious that you have tried to spray your gray .  I wear wigs and I only wanted GRAY AWAY for my hair line  near my ears. When the wind blows,  my wig is blown away from my ears and my gray side burns are exposed - I hate that. So this product is a quick fix for that. But it is still messy and I have to be careful that it does not blow into my eyes.  I think it is airborne.  I would never use this product as a way to cover a whole head of gray (or the roots).  It is extremely messy and it made my particular hair very stiff.  (I'm a black woman with coarse hair)  I can't believe anyone would be please with this stuff.<br /><br />Awful.<br />dlp
B000JNQSIQ|5|I first started cutting my hair with just a pair of scissors but after messing up countless times I decided to buy electric clippers. These things work like a charm. It comes with plenty of different size guides so that you get the right cut every time as well as hair cutting scissors, a comb and a guide on how to correctly cut hair. The first time I used it I had no idea how to even cut my hair with electric clippers and it came out better than I've ever cut my hair before. I can now cut my hair in the same amount of time it used to take to get it cut at a barber and it'll look great too. Perfect for any man looking to save money from haircuts.
B007AU0FXA|5|As expected
B0075JDZGA|1|This product might be a good thing for your skin, but the advertisement for it never states the SIZE of the bottle, how many ounces, etc.  Shouldnt it give that information?  Because using 4 dropperfuls a day to drink and two droperfulls for your skin  means this bottle will run out very quickly!!!!
B000FEF1V4|4|This is not a knock your socks off trimmer but it is an excellent trimmer for the money! I bought it as a no bull trimmer for my father who has multiple levels of a beard and mustache. He now has no problem finding the correct length trimmer guides or deal with a pile of clippings because the trimmer pretty much takes care of that for him. The only thing that could be a bit better is the regular speed vacuum misses some clippings when being rushed through the clipping of your beard, but I guess thats why they made this clipper with a &#34;turbo&#34; function that increases the speed of the blades and increases vacuum at the same time. The only other thought I have about it is the clipping trap itself is small if you have a heavy beard or let it grow to long before clipping again but you could always empty it while clipping in the garbage and continue clipping.<br /><br />Overall an excellent trimmer! Would buy again.
B000C1ZDTU|1|My wife has worn this scent for years. She tells me that this bottle has very little fragrance... Smells like mostly alcohol... Possibly old stock... Very disappointed! Box was discarded so we could not return.
B00GURSV6W|5|I have toned skin and the weight is off as well. I am just glad that I did not waste my money on this. It is the best buy that I have made and one that actually gave me the results that I wanted.
B0015346UQ|5|After having the Pedegg for over a year it became dull.  Ordered the replacement blades and it's working well.
B004G55L86|4|Exactly what you expect to get, 3 medium sized claw grip hair clips.
B000056KK0|5|This product is very hard to find and I was very pleased that you had it and the price was great and the shipping price was great. It came and it was exactly what I wanted and thank you very much and it was a great experience.
B008K517M2|5|This product is not exactly the same as what was sold as Loving Care in the US.  The ingredient list is is not the same, it smells different.  The conditioner is totally different.  However, it works just as well.  If anything, this product has more \\"staining\\" power.  It washes out from normal hair over 2-3 weeks, but some color definitely stays in gray and highlighted hair.  The ash brown shades are not the same formulations as it has none of the purple/cool shades I used see when rinsing it out the after application.  That being said, I've been very happy with the colors.
B005FRJKWW|5|work well and great for the price
B004WTY4MU|4|I really enjoy these feather extensions. They are a good color and size and easy to get in and out of your hair. I did purchase additional beads so I could wear it as often or as little as I liked.
B0019ZZFJ6|5|Bought this for my husband and he was uninterested until he tried it!  He is mid-thirties and was just using tweezers for his nose hairs. He is now a believer. Great quality product.
B000C216J0|3|Greg smelling but doesn't stay long unfortunately because I use the lotion and bath gel and I really like them.
B0094GHKFE|4|I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that it flakes (and I also didn't purchase on amazon), but I love CG clump crusher as a base coat to separate and volumize my lashes. To mitigate flaking, I simply cover with a top coat of my fave upscale mascara: Hypnose by Lancome. That stays creamy and lustrous all day, feels very conditioning - and doesn't flake. Best of both worlds. CG clump crusher to start and Lancome Hypnose to finish. I get compliment on my lashes all the time. Go for it!
B0012187R4|1|junk
B001JHALHK|4|I think the price of blades is ridiculous and has been for years. Gillette has a monopoly and keeps consumers on an upgrade treadmill with prices outpacing inflation. I mean at what point are further improvements to the blade technology even possible? I think the Mach 3 Turbo is just fine thanks and where can I sget the best price? Here on Amazon I found the 20 pack for $40. $2/blade is about the best I've found so far
B000POYUPC|5|Transaction went smoothly. The product works well.
B00A6YIZES|5|Don't know why I haven't always had a shaving bag like this. I love this product. Bonus is if you are always on the run like me, just keep everything in it. Saves on counter space.
B0045KNJIQ|1|I read all the wonderful reviews about this product and thought, hey it's cheap and worth trying! Man was I WRONG!!! It smelt absolutely great but it damaged my hair so much I had to get a deep conditioner to re-hydrate my extremely dry hair. I had to cut about 3inches of my hair, and for the average black woman that can take about 6 months or longer to grow back! Smells good but it's damage in a bottle for the average AFRICAN AMERICAN woman's hair. :-) (This is my 2nd review my 1st one was mysteriously deleted)
B000Q7XDR4|5|This is my favorite lotion. Makes your skin feel like silk and smells good too!!
B00387F426|4|I rate this product as a 4 because....it is a little dry.  I usually use Lancome moisturizer and it is so soft and every time you apply it, you think about how good it feels.  Since I am trying the RoC products, I wanted to stick with the RoC.
B00OP255DG|5|The scent of this product is amazing! The scent is perfect,light,floral,fruity and unique without being over powering. I have mixed race hair (Black and Irish) My hair is long,curly,frizzy,dry and sometimes crunchy! This product is a \\"light\\" oil for my hair type. It softens and adds shine without making my hair greasy. I use it in the afternoon on dry hair to fight the midday frizzies! A little goes a long way so its an excellent value too.<br /><br />Overall, I love the product and the scent is so delightful. Its totally worth trying !
B00853F31U|5|Nice product. Covers evenly  :)
B00I32AN4K|5|I have never taken time to review a product until now.  This product is fantastic!  I have very long fine hair that I get colored and highlighted every eight weeks.  The last two winters have been very drying to my hair along with the chemical processing.  My hair was starting to look like straw.  I tried many products and home remedies and nothing was working.  I had resigned myself to believing I would have to cut my hair.  Then I saw this product and the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I have used it twice and the transformation already is incredible.  My hair is soft and shiny and healthy looking and it is full of body without using styling products or blow drying.  I have already ordered another jar.  Highly recommend,
B0013ND45G|4|I really liked how this coloring worked even over unbleached hair but the company now has dealings with china and can no longer be considered cruelty free so I don't use it any more.
B000052XQR|5|Weird reason to buy this but  I actually utilized this as a squirrel deterrent for my bird feeder and does this do the trick!! I've tried everything to outwit the sneaky pests but using this vaseline to grease the pole has left my bird feeder unmolested ever since. This stuff stays on there rain or snow and really doesn't need to be reapplied too often. I'm happy I'm not spending $$ all the time on replacement birdseed and my birds are able to get nice and fat for upcoming  winter!
B000W405SG|4|DOES THE JOB
B004KU1WPS|5|This is a fantastic product that was worth the price when around $17 a bottle. Now that the price has consistently risen, it's ridiculous. I would never purchase this (or the similar Pravana Perfection Blow Dry Spray, which was originally priced around $13 a bottle and it now being sold for just over $33 a bottle...price gouging).<br /><br />I absolutely loved this product, and wish I had bought more when the price was more reasonable...it seems to have more than DOUBLED everywhere I have looked, or it's sold out. Until I can find it at a more reasonable price, I will go back to using Aveda.
B003ICXD4M|5|My first flat iron and it is just what I wanted.  I only need to straighten the front sides of my hair and it does the trick.
B007HJ9VFM|4|for the price, good for small jobs, pulls a little in the nose hairs but got used to it.  works on eyebrow trimming etc.  hell to get old and hairy!  fast and easy.
B00TW13D5M|5|This is definitely the best set of beauty blenders I have ever used!  I was so excited to finally find some that didn't make my makeup look cakey or blotchy.  They apply makeup so easily and flawlessly that I was truly blown away.  The orange one is my absolute favorite for use with my cream-to-powder foundation.  I get the top 1/3 of it wet to apply the foundation, then the backside (flat) to smooth out any residual and blend it all in to a dry finish.  The pink one is equally as great, I like that I can get great coverage and an even application without getting the oils from my hands in the product.  This is a great duo for girls just starting out on up to the seasoned makeup artist! I received these at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.
B007IUPZJG|5|This is one of the best hair products I have ever used for volume and just great feeling hair.I originally ordered one (1) bottle and within a couple of days of using it, I ordered my second one.I find the ALTERNA products to be superior. I also use the KENDI OIL and love it. I also use the BAMBOO hairspray and it gives your hair shine and hold. Love everything I have ordered. Thank you
B006GOQ8RI|4|very nice ,a little dot goes along way.
B00CHSSS84|5|This reclosable wet wipes have proven to be indispensable to me.Quite handy for cleanups and messes.I find new ways of using it everyday.Antibacterial and smells nice too. Also a great value for a six pack of 30 counts per pack.
B007HCEGAO|5|I WISH THIS PRODUCT WAS CHEAPER BUT THIS IS ALL I EVER USR SO I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT I SAVE A FEW DOLLORS BUYING FROM AMAZON .
B009MQUTR2|5|Excellent
B0009Y6M0O|5|I have been using this product now for about 4 weeks, and all I can say is, \\"it works for me\\".  I've tried A LOT of products in the past to help even out my facial skin tone, a problem I've had since I was a teenager. I am now in my 40's.  Most of other products I've used lightened my skin but they also blocked my pores and contributed to extended bouts with acne and razor bumps.  I was really concerned that this product would do the same because it contains Sunflower and Mineral oil, a no-no if you're trying to clear up your acne.  However, when I felt the texture of the lotion, it didn't feel oily/greasy, so I was willing to give it a try.      Long story short, I've seen noticeable improvement in my skin tone, particularly in the neck area of my face, where I've battled razor bumps.  My skin is also smoother to the touch.  This product contains \\"Meadow Sweet Extract\\", a lightening agent that I believe is the active ingredient in getting rid of discoloration and overall blotchy skin. It is not as harsh as other lightening agents.     I'd like to add one caveat.  The instructions tell you to use this product twice a day, in the morning and in the evening until you see improvement and then use is once a day to \\"maintain\\".  However, since I have a darker complexion, I only use it once a day (at night) because on me, the product initially leaves a noticeable film that might make you a little self conscious in public.  It eventually dissolves, but that's a fact you should know.    I do wish this product was more reasonably priced, but I'm glad I finally found a product that works for me.
B001EA53NY|5|Wonderful flat iron.  Love it!! Very pleased with the performance and the  straightening of my hair.  I have normally frizzy hair, and this does the trick!!
B00G67GPRS|5|Love my perfume and the quick shipping was a bonus !!
B00F5CUKFI|5|I love this fragrance!
B00ICOLH8A|3|Works better in shower but again comb handle snapped off same day be bought it, but has been best datangler comb yet.  I think it's the wen shampoo
B007S69QAY|1|THe clips do not hold the curlers in place and I burnt me head and hands
B000X9RKEW|5|I bought it as a gift, so I cannot say if it smells good, but i love the packaging, it looks very fancy.  My friend loved it.
B006G56CP0|4|I read the reviews and most of them say it doesn't work but the first time using it I noticed improvement of my teeth!!
B00MHZRQ94|2|the roller balls fall out of their base so they are only good for vials.
B00550SVZG|5|Amazing! Lasts forever!!
B00171SOLI|5|Good
B005SD1ZFS|5|I read other reviews about this product and i don't think is bad at all. I like the color Cheeky, because it stays in your lips for a lot of time. True, you can't get the effect that is show in the TV, but for me is good how it works.
B00JEX60CG|3|The brushes don't quite fit but they come close enough to be workable.
B002AMUFTC|5|Very happy with this product!  It go on like silk and a little bit goes a long way!  Makes my skin so soft and it tightens wrinkles very effectively. I can't really see the gold speckles on my face but that's OK.  Try it, you will love it too!
B002YFW28W|5|OMG Love ittttttttt , this flower is amazing i ordered for my bridesmaids they r so cute it comes in small box with a paper says thank you from the owner cant wait to see on my BM hair for my big day august .Thank you so much
B0065JM84G|5|I struggle with dry feet and hands and I really LOVE this stuff!  I use foot balm on my hands and Atopalm is not greasy or messy. I have tried many products and this will be my tried and true!
B0072ZFHD6|5|Im taking this product for parasites that I got from eating sushi.  Do your research on dosage per ailment.  Im taking 2 capsules a day for one week on an empty stomach, 30 mins to an hour before meal.  ONE week on... TWO weeks off... and repeat.  Taken incorrectly or for too long can cause bodily harm.
B0039YQ7WY|3|I actually LOVE this product. However, I purchased it from a different company this time through Amazon. Although the product was sealed, when I opened it part of the plastic piece inside the tube was loose. This concerns me, because I get the feeling it was tampered with. I will NOT buy this product through the most recent company I purchased it from. I will buy it again from the original company I purchased the product from the first time I ordered it.
B00T55VQU4|5|Wow does this ever smell wonderful. Who would imagine that roses and ocean would possibly go together?<br /><br />The bottle is gorgeous. It is tall and thin aluminum with a pump spray. The sprayer makes a really fine mist. I'll admit it, on a hot day, even for a guy, this feels fabulous sprayed on my face. The smell and the cooling effect are outstanding.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.
B00DIACSQ8|5|This is after a month of having this hair in it has be washed and a bang added and re curled I love it I have only had mim shedding but other than that it is worth the price
B0043L4JBI|4|its good, works well, thanks
B0079070NY|5|I am really pleased with this serum. I'm using it on my neck and chest which have a lot of discoloration from sun damage. It's been about a month and I am starting to see quite a dramatic improvement in the texture of my skin and a decrease in the discoloration .
B000MVYJ0O|5|smeels so good want to get another
B00147JMMU|5|I've heard good things about this product but found it way too expensive in stores. Then I found this and I counldnt not buy it. I really love this product! It's great as a base coat. My polish actually stays on way longer then with my previous base coat and my nails aren't split or chipping anymore. A must buy.
B004EMJ9EI|5|This is the best quality Indigo I've ever purchased and I've been using henna and Indigo to color my hair for over 5 years.  I will continue to purchase from this vendor and recommend to others as well.
B00H1N4CXK|1|Not what I thought.
B00M1E55HQ|5|I like it very much
B008FKECU6|5|I received a lot great comments.
B00BN1MP5S|5|Good price.
B00OPCHAB6|2|Product arrived packaged well..was excited to get try it .. Opened lid to find it had already been opened/damaged seal..appears to have been used prior to shipping hole punctured torn open in middle directly in seal inside under lid w some leakage all around inside of jar. Scared to use it as lid had been placed back on w an apparent attempt to real seal product to look new
B007XCAD3W|5|benefit keep them coming<br />I think I have them all<br />packaging great<br />shimery-but not too much.  not gummy, gloppy, or globby
B000NYG3JA|5|We live in Australia and my fiancee is crazy about this stuff.   After hours of searching, days of waiting and weeks of it finally arriving here in our Kangaroo infested territory, we got it. She was overjoyed. Best lip salve ever.
B00KNEDQ72|5|I do'nt usually paint my eyebrows very often but this definitely helps me to give you a better way daily, it is a good product, you do not run and stays on your skin all day.
B005F5J5Z6|5|I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR OVER A YEAR IT MAKES MY SKIN VERY SOFT AND MOISTURIZED(I AM 74YRS.OLD)<br />I HAVE NO WRINKLES BUT I HAVE rosacea which it helps with the redness
B000P231CW|5|Long lasting, beautiful scent for the modern gentleman.
B009GYVMAS|3|I expected so much more from this mask. It works okay but the texture is &#34;chunkier&#34; than I expected. It removes easily and rinses away cleanly without too much harsh scrubbing. So far the results seem to be on par with every other face mask I've ever tried.
B000VON818|4|Arrived intact. Smells good.
B00153JZ16|3|The deodorant works fine, but seemed old and dried out.  Like it's been sitting around a warehouse for 20 years, which it probably has. Still, I will buy it again as this problem is merely cosmetic.
B004LQGQ48|1|horrible
B006OZF398|5|I have very oily skin and sun spots, and this primer reduces the redness, controls the shine and optically decreases the size of the pores. My skin appears to be softer, clearer and with a more uniform aspect when I wear it. I haven't experienced the flakiness, but I wear this primer under the Clear Face Neutrogena sunblock, which sometimes flakes off.
B002JVWV4Q|4|I really like this.  I wanted to get away from aluminum in deodorants, and have had difficulty with the hard mineral stick deodorants.  This is better, but I have to combine it with alcohol to keep everything in check.  But, if I use both, I don't have underarm odor.
B000NJ0S2I|5|My wife, Naomi, swears by, rather than at, this hair dryer.  Quite simply put, it's the best.<br />TONY HOROWITZ
B005YE0RSC|5|Oils smelled great the warmer I bought to go w wasn't worth the money so mixed w bottled water and boiled on stove and my house smelled amazing.
B00K0E9ZVQ|2|Did not really work for me
B00PIDDE1G|5|Really enjoy this line of products! All natural and always my face feel nice and refreshed!
B0062A5VQ0|5|We have been using this (on our kids too) for several months & we really like it.
B007OWQXW6|4|this razor has decent weight to it, the butterfly feature is nice as it makes it easy to clean and change blades, the butterfly mechanism is smooth and i will loosen it sometimes so that i can get a more aggressive shave it also makes rinsing it out between strokes a breeze i would recommend this more than the weishi for this price range i would give it five stars.
B00EOMBVKS|1|No directions anywhere... Not helpful
B0000A1WGK|5|I purchased this for my mother-in-law before she went on a cruise.  She was very happy with the hair straightener, light but enough heat to straighten her hair like her one at home.  Worked in foreign hotels and on the cruise ship.
B008074JOI|5|I have very curly afro textured, and this product works really well with my hair type and length. My hair is cut very low like a guy, so this product further defines my curls, keeps them in shape, and provides a very nice shine. It also last the whole day or more depending on how I sleep on it. I would recommend this product to anyone with very curly hair who wants definition and hold without flaking. I just love it! The picture I provided is me with the product in my hair....if that helps.
B002EXFX1W|3|I like the look and hold of this comb...however, the combs are made of metal that bends easily in my very thick hair.  Plastic combs would work better for me.
B003BFXKV2|2|It is floral, but what flower exactly - no idea, definitely not lilies of the valley. It is really intrusive at first, sharp, but it disappears completely within half an hour.
B000BYST12|5|This is a must for the obagi system. Once you've applied #3, then #4 can go on for daytime use. It works beautifully in helping the skin shed old skin cells. I've been using it for years.
B002XGVHY2|5|Loved this item.
979079035X|5|Great Product! Great Seller!
B00HOHLKY2|5|I have used other brands of Vitamin C serum but this one is my favorite. It is clear and odorless and I definitely see results.
B00GB9IVS2|5|I purchased 5 of the makeup brushes and although I rarely post reviews these brushes were so good they deserved the credit.  After a lot of research I really lucked out by picking this brand.  These are by far the best brushes I have ever owned and the company makeup geek is really committed to customer satisfaction.
B0017SQ3B4|5|Great stuff expensive but worth every penny
B00ZKLLZAI|4|I was able to try Crest 3D White Brilliance Daily Cleansing & Whitening System for free through BzzAgent where it was sent to me to try for the next couple weeks and review. When you clean your teeth with this product it feels strong like it is really working. The flavor was a little intense for me but I've gotten used to it overtime using it. And the final purpose: it whitens! It was more noticeable with my husband who has genetically slightly-yellow teeth, and after using this for a little while he's teeth were much whiter! So, besides the strong flavor I would say I like this product and it does actually whiten teeth.
B00HHFTCAK|1|Broke as soon as I took it out of package
B004M1BO3U|5|works great
B0012J30LY|2|Okay products leave behind a residue thatis very annoying for me, so I won't purchase again.
B00JWV0FXU|5|Always great to have
B004NREC82|5|just right thank you
B0000AYXBZ|5|My wife uses this because of her pain it makes her feel better when we have rain if it wasn't for this I think  she would go insane.
B0086VI9LC|5|I use these for years.
B00JKC4TIS|5|My wife has tried many different mascaras and this is one of her favorites around this price range. Gives her lashes length and volume!
B00NUDQ41I|5|Love these for the car
B005NIQDEQ|5|I absolutely love this brush. The Mac 195 Concealer Brush is worth every penny I especially love using this to apply concealer just right under my eyebrows to make my bottom brow line really pop. If you are considering adding this brush to your make up routine I say go for it and I give the 195, two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!
B008YDXM28|5|I love this brand. The price is better than other brands. The coconut smells great and produce a great lather. I only buy Taylor shaving cream products. They last a long time. You do not need to use a lot. I highly recommend a badger brush to go with it. The brushes help lift your hair for proper shaving. Just buy it and I promise you won't be disappointed!
B0077S1MFA|5|excellent product
B0056AO3YI|1|Normally hair feather extensions last 1 to 2 months.  With these microlinks, the feathers were falling out within 1-2 DAYS and I had to return my customers' money.  I am throwing out the remaining links I purchased from here and will never use them again.
B008KEJ1LM|2|I enjoy the precision when it comes to hair cut length (0.5mm increments) but it does a poor job cutting compared to a typical hair clipper. It takes a bit longer with these because I have to go over my head more than usual.<br /><br />It comes with a charging stand, but unfortunately there's no way of knowing when it's fully charged. Also, you might find the battery dying at the most inconvenient time. This has a charging stand, so you can't keep it plugged in while cutting. As I type this, I'm waiting for mine to recharge. It died in the middle of a cut and I currently have a reverse mohawk.
B000EM9D6Q|5|It leaves your hair feeling smooth and tames your hair. I have try other products that have not work so good on my hair,  leaved it greasy and flat.
B000ZV0D9W|4|A must buy for nail stamping lovers!!
B004K1BZD6|5|This works really well. I used to pay a lot for Pataday but this is over the counter and works better.
B002X9XV48|4|Smells great and makes my skin feel so soft! Only down side is the name &#34;luminary&#34; is a sticker and it came off right away but bottle is in tact and lotion is great
B00KOH8DVM|5|It really does the job!!!!!
B00LCCFERY|5|I purchased this at Marshall's, also for $4.99, and it is enough to make me want to visit Australia.  It is a wonderful, very tropical scent that includes:  lemon oil, eucalyptus oil, organic vanilla oil and tea tree oil.  The final ingredient is &#34;perfume&#34;.  It seems that I can smell coconut too, though it is not listed.  Unique and refreshing.
B001A7WV0Y|5|Thanks
B00CP6C85M|5|I tried this product out as a sample from the beauty store and I loved it.<br />I normally just wash my hair then put this in and leave it over night. I have really damaged hair but since using this product my hair is back to being shiny and healthy.
B004RV4LZI|5|Very worth the price, love the lotion!
B00D5DUNS8|4|Delivery was promptly.  Products in good order.  Would shop again.
B005DKKBUG|5|This is the best shaver I have owned until now.  Well thought out, easy to use and close shave. Great price on Gold Box. Update. After exactly one year of use, the shaver quit taking a charge. Also issues with cleaning system not cycling completely, leaving a wet and semi-clean shaver. 2 year warrantee, so keep invoice and packaging!
B004SIIHXM|5|grate product I liked for the price !
B001ADOUH0|5|After months of not finding this lipstick gloss I have come to love, a friend suggested the internet.  Low and behold, there it was....and at such an incredible price.  Instead of buying one I bought 4!  Now I know where I will turn to for shopping when I can't find it in the stores.  Go Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008134WZ2|5|This company makes great facial masks!!! I luv the feeling of using them. So fresh and make ur skin flawless!!! <3
B003SSTL42|5|Been using this stuff for 2 years now. No one can tell I am in my upper 30s people often think I am mid to upper 20s so I intend to keep using it. Helps clear up acne too so I use it only about once a month when my hormones are going crazy... helps put my skin back on track
B004KU1WPS|5|I have curly hair and this product is the best I have found for using a flat iron on my hair.  Works great and leaves a nice shine.
B00A99XF0Y|1|This soap smells terrible! Don't buy it!
B004GV8HA4|5|It works well with my hair. It keeps it bouncy. best product for my curly hair to moisturize and prevent frizz.
B001SEQN2G|5|very good!
B000VOPFIC|5|Great transaction,Great product
B00DI9XX4U|5|I love this cream makes your skin very soft ....I will buy this again.
B004H8D34Q|5|Strong and durable.  Will cut the thickest hair with ease.  Quick delivery and reliable.  I recommend the Wahl 8-Pack Color Coded Cutting Guides with Organizer to go with this remarkably good clipper.
B002A6HU8M|5|Only thing I've ever found that helps my nails...even if I just use it once a day, I can tell a huge difference in the strength of my nails. I've been a nail biter my entire life and have really ruined my nail beds. With this product though it makes them look healthy, I don't have to do anything to my cuticles either when using this....love it! It's a miracle product!
B007AKXZ8M|5|This is the absolute best stuff for curly frizzy hair! My hair is very fine, and frizzy and just ugly if I dont have this product! I do have to apply a generous amount to the ends but I can towel dry, apply ringlet, and let my hair air dry and I have beautiful curls.  Love Love Love this stuff!  I have tried many many more store bought products and they do not even compare to this stuff. It is well worth the money!
B00CXG1LXY|2|Cheap and poor quality. Feels like it was going to break. You get what you pay for with this item.
B003VCIT16|4|I THINK THIS REALLY DOES WORK IT SEEMS TO SOFTEN  FINE LINES AND WRINKLES  I WILL CERTAINLY BUY THIS AGAIN....
B000GCLRF4|5|This product was bought for a friend of mine, but I have used these in the past.  I LOVE them and so did he.  They do not sell this exact brand in any stores around here anymore and it is great to know that I can get them online and from a prompt seller.  I had some issues with forgetting to not add the bill because this was a birthday present and upon contacting the seller they were quick to respond and not include the bill as requested.  Thank you!
B001P1Y0HM|1|i received this item and there was about 1/4 of it gone and it looked very very old<br />and looked like it was watered down.  I will not buy this item again.
B00LPRT210|5|Just what I was looking for.
B002DP19ZU|5|I absolutely love this pallet it has neutral colors perfect for an everyday wear but also shimmery colors for a night out. I would highly recommend.
B003ZEXVRC|3|I was really worried that I wouldn't like this product after reading the very mixed reviews. But, I am missing some teeth and financially unable to have the problem professionally addressed. Since it is so inexpensive i figured, worth a try.the secure smile website tells you the product needs to be customized,it does. I did it with a nail file and in 45 minutes I had a passable looking smile. Objective people told me if they did not know my situation, they would not think the teeth looked fake.they do protrude slightly because I still have teeth of my own. In my opinion it still looks better than missing fronts.Be patient when following the directions and the product does work. May not be for everyone but certainly don't have much to lose to give it a try.Don't expect a miracle and you too might be glad to have given them a chance.God Bless!
B004GQNAZG|3|this item  is really cute but why so expensive in the drama it was only 3 dollars and the 100 cuss he did not get his change this is really cute but pricy and no i did not by this item i just think its really cute but pricey  beautiful
B002ANF9HE|5|Helps my face does what it advertises. Love it, buying more. Love the smell, a little goes a long way
B004JNMOB2|4|I ordered this item and it's my own fault for not shopping around enough however this exact plate is available for half the price. Taking into account that the plate came from overseas, it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I've used it four times in two days and I am very happy with it.
B00KBOAXOI|5|I got the Juicy Peach and I absolutely love it! I was looking for something that would add a little color but not too much, and this was perfect! It also smells super yummy ^_^ already deciding which one to order next! Oh and it also arrived incredibly quick which rocked &#60;3
B000NKL3D0|1|So I read all the reviews on all the Curels, etc. I'm a fan of Curel while my wife likes a different brand. Previously I had used the daily or whatnot and it was great. I thought I would try this one, hoping the citrus smell or whatever it's called wouldn't be bad. I was wrong. Not only does it have a citrus smell - it has another type of smell in it. I can't really quite describe it. But it's terrible and I'm not mistaken - my wife smells it too. I'm going to stick to the zero smell of the daily.
B000143C0K|5|I am initially impressed with this trimmer.  Time will tell how well it lasts, but so far I'm impressed.  All the positive reviews on this product are accurate as far as I can tell.
B00KZHP1GG|5|Love this product!  It was a good price too
B004FW21Q0|5|I have limp flat hair:( I use this product on my damp hair applying it on the roots. After blow drying it gives me a nice full lift.
B002QANC2A|5|Absolutely LOVE this pallette. For someone who is a makeup addict and has never ordered a pallette offline, I'm pretty pleased. The colors are awesome and when used with a base on the eyelid, the colors pop! I wanted a pallette that not only had electrifying colors, but nudes. With this pallette you get exactly that. I'm very pleased! 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
B002VUAM2S|5|I bought the product because of the tea tree, unsure of how it would make me feel. I really like it. It lasts a long time and smells nice. I have a hard time with smells because for some reason they all smell like ant killer, but this one is a gentle smell that really fades leaving you feeling good and clean for a long time!
B0045XSLWW|5|Both my sister and I LOVED the nail polish. Its salon quality and dries pretty quickly. She cannot wait for me to buy more colors.
B000QCHVJK|4|Very nice product. Makes the human hair wigs very soft.
B00TEFAB9M|5|I have dry hands and was looking for a great moisturizing skin cream that I can use on a regular basis. Easy to use pump dispenses just the right amount, and the cream vanishes leaving my hands hydrated and feeling non-greasy or sticky. Non-smelling and really helps my cracked knuckles and corners of my fingertips. Like the larger size and worth every penny! I have sensitive skin and this cream seems to do the trick. Would highly recommend this to others as a high quality cream for daily use.
B00KO87UD8|4|Love the way the shampoo make my hair feel.
B004Y9JURC|4|I love this mascara because it doesn't clump your lashes. The color is nice and dark. The only negative thing is that it dries more quickly than other mascara.
B008SM4BIO|4|Excellent
B00142ADF0|3|Strange chemical scent. Not a strong scent, but noticeable. Absorbs well into my skin, but absolutely terrible in my hair and that's why I bought it.
B00DG8EZKO|5|I love my Nivea lotion.I will not use any others lotion.My skin is so soft to touch and baby smooth.
B002HWS7YU|5|They do not have any glue spots and they provide a comfortable shave. Dorcos are good razors and I might buy them again.
B001VH6F9G|4|Fits better than the after market foil and cutters. I usually replace every two years.  Shop around for the best price.
B000MASTN8|5|I can see a change in my skin tone within in the first week and really think my slight wrinkles are minimized! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
B0035DLDOG|4|It's very inexpensive and works well on my skin. I've been using this<br />products since early 70's, and I really recomend to try them.
B003II4D2C|3|I like it...but then after a while of using it...well it was slower...and did not take all my hair out from the root....maybe I need to replace the battery. I just think it should have lasted longer and removed moved hair.
B002T71IL2|3|I have used this item twice and it is a little messy and I get it in my eyes. It does not hurt but I just can't get the hang of it.
B005FYAQRI|5|I bought these because I have quite a collection of nail polish, especially the gel colors.  Some colors are hard to tell in the bottle what they look like on your nail.  These help lots!
B00C7HM818|5|Doesnt burn your hair and the curls stay for a long time.
B00FQIQ1BS|5|these are great! wonderful design with Black and white and a bit of sparkle and color, easy to apply, long lasting. you can be so creative using these little beauties. highly recommend for the person that wants to show off some cutest nails ever! Great for any occasion too... don't just save for Christmas.
B00G053H6I|5|I have had no problems with these, and all have stamped perfectly.  I'm really glad I found them, saved me a ton of money.  Worth the price, and lots of value.  You won't be disappointed, get them!!!!!  :)
B003CTTZQQ|5|This product is my BBBBAAAAABBBY!!
B001BWBBDG|5|This perfume is the best I have found in recent years.  The elixir blend lasts for a very long time.  Just love the way it smells.
B003F151CI|1|It looks like this company went out of business. Customer service plays a tape without picking up. Phone messages do not get returned...
B009XPRZKG|5|I got the wine/deep purple colored purse/cosmetic organizer and ILOVE IT!!! I have not 1 single complaint and I wasnt expecting too much, however I would reccomend this to friends and family for sure!!! =D
B00Q5ERAWQ|5|How do I love thee? The moisturizer came in the same sort of bottle as the Eye Gel, but it was a bit taller and rounder. The pump was equally as easy to use. The Retinol Moisturizer was not greasy, nor did it make my face feeling greasy. My face was incredibly soft and my usual dry spots that I get from washing my face did not show up. I AM going to buy this again. So very nice. I am glad I got to try this one. It is really hard to find a moisturizer that doesn’t make me break out with acne or a rash. Now to add it to my Amazon wish list…
B003E1183U|5|IIt truly is the best shampoo I have  use this shampoo after I color my hair and it works exceptional.  My hair is very silky and manageable with it..
B003GXC0T2|4|I REALLY like this product.  A little goes a long way and the smell is amazing!! I would have given it 5 stars, however it does make my hair have a bit of static.
B002LHGM6Q|5|works great
B001BAWMY0|5|Unless you sleep on your back and never roll over onto your side or stomach, do not consider this device. I was feeling slightly claustrophobic with my other mask and figured this small nasal device would work for me, but instead I got sores on my nose from rolling over on it, and bouts with mild apnea since once it shifted on my face - it leaked. I've learned to love the other more conventional mask I currently used despite it's larger size. However, service was fast and the system is \\"light\\" so if you never leave your back, it could be a great choice for you?! Just not for me.
B00G6T4U2I|5|Love it
B002QI2TPI|4|This cake powder is great if you're looking for something a little bit more than just a brow pencil to fill in or accentuate your brows. The brushes that come with it work well, and the wax stuff is okay if you use it sparingly, or else any powder you put on seems to slip of because the wax gets super oily if you use too much. My only major complaint about this thing is that the brushes are SUPER difficult to get out of the case. This didn't seem like a big deal at first, but it just gets to be a pain to use, especially if you're in tight quarters or in a car. I'm also a klutz and have big fingers... so  maybe this isn't even as big of a deal as I'm making it out to be. I'd buy this again, but if you're looking for something quick and easy to apply, this probably isn't for you.
B0030GSEWC|5|This men's soap is one of 3 Dove soaps made for Men that I know about.  I use this soap exclusively as it works, it is gentle on the skin and has a very mild very pleasing scent.  The Dove products for men seem to be top quality all the way and are the only bath products I use.  They don't cause problems, rashes or anything like that.  They are mild and do the job they were created to do.<br />I am sold on Dove products for men and particularly this soap.
B000EY4YLS|5|works on the kiddies - relatively easy to apply for a non-chemical product.
B0047F708O|4|I've been using the Youth Code products about 6 months.  They make my skin feel great.  Great pricing on Amazon for them, too.  I live in the desert, so having the serum along with the face lotion and the day lotion with the sunscreen makes my face feel great. Highly recommended!
B003JM4OCG|5|The wife loves it - delivery is a little slow -
B003LZXOXQ|4|no
B001K801UA|5|new bottle, new look still works the same --  hawaiian tropic dark lotion
B001RVGVF4|5|Best dry shampoo there is! It does not weight hair down, or feel chalky all day long like most other brands.
B000GD03TO|3|I'd previously been using the Denorex - which worked pretty well for me - -<br />I'd alternate their Coal Tar shampoo with the exfoliant one (which I really liked for the anti-itch properties of the Menthol)<br />But - - when they changed their packaging (bottles looked the same but only held 10 oz instead of 12 - for the SAME PRICE)<br />I went looking for something else.<br />-<br />Reviews on Amazon were through the roof for THIS product - - so fine - - lets try it.<br />Coal Tar equivalent on this is LESS than for Denorex - - and if I do NOT use it 3 - 4 times per week, the problem comes back.<br />My routine is to apply it full strength to the problem areas and let it sit for 15 min while I do other things.<br />Then shower it off.<br />So in the final analysis - it seems to work - but for me, is NOT the answer
B006UI4ZKW|5|Outstanding product
B00CMQNP9S|1|When I open the package, I did not like the item since it was bad quality so I end up throwing it away without using it.
B000SRTOC0|5|these are very sharp and cut very clean. very high quality product. highly recommend.
B00DQ7P4NW|1|After reading many reviews and speaking with retail associates I decided to purchase this face cream as a preventative treatment. I am 22 and have normal to oily skin. I have dull skin and was looking for something to brighten it up. The product came and I was excited to try it. It dried my skin out so bad I was flaking like I had spent a week in Mexico. It was very uncomfortable and took awhile to stop the flaking after I stopped using the product. Tried to use less and less frequently and saw no results besides dry flaky skin. I ended up giving it to my 48 year old mom and she has been using it for a few months. She likes the product but hasn't seen any actual skin improvements. Overall, a waste of money for what I was looking for.
B005QAFTY6|5|thouh it says no frangrance it has a great light scent that comes out more after you tan  it is a good lotion that you dont smell funny after. this is the only lotion i have used that has completely taken away that after funk of odor.
B00028OU5Q|3|I found the Aubrey Organics - Blue Green Algae Hair Mask, okay; it did not do any more for my hair than other hair masks I have used, I do recommend, however, that this review does not deter you from trying it, I believe in Aubrey Organics products .....
B00BFAFAS6|5|These are the absolute best for removing makeup after a long day. I have tried about 15 other brands and these effectively remove all makeup without stinging out drying out my face. LOVE!
B0092MCO88|5|I'm using it as I write this review!!! I love it let me tell you what to do!  1)style hair as desired or just detangle as normal 2) turn or Netflix or your favorite show 3) stack your pillows on you bed to prop your back comfortably 4)plug in your dryer and assemble now enjoy! Lol idk why people are making this device to difficult! Put the thing on your bed and make sure you have a towel around your neck so it doesn't burn, that's the beauty of this dryer!!! You can lounge around the house with it! Get you and extension cord and sit in the couch or the bed there is no need to be sitting on the floor or tables no longer ladies! And it heats up fast and medium setting is hot enough
B005GOVYEG|4|I really liked it! Smells great and lasts for about 6 hours... A good deal for just $9,99...
B00139U8YA|5|Everything seems to make me itch, except this! I usually get out of the shower and I look like I have hives on my legs from all the other body washes I have used, but this doesn't! I'm thrilled to have found something that keeps my skin in good shape!<br />-Chanel
B0017JY8HY|5|Love this hair pick. I have thick curly hair and this holds it up very well. In addition it is super cute for work when we are doing special events.
B007QE1ZR0|4|I've used this product for years to untangle my fine and curly hair.  Someone mentioned it leaves a residue which I hadn't noticed before their review.  Since then, I can tell there is a slight residue but it helps in my case by giving my fine hair a bit more body.  I take it with me when I travel.
B003TDXVBA|5|It is a tooth brush and does the job it is supposed too.  I would recommend to anyone who needs a new brush
B003YJAZZ4|4|Still working 4 years later, but apparently the head is supposed to lock into place.  Mine never did, but still a good shave.
B000092OX4|1|This product its not all that great when u start using it it feels nice but after a while my face started getting bumps and the smells was disgusting......I recently started using mary kay wow what a difference and wayyy cheaper! bye bye olay!
B003TNQG4E|2|I'm giving it two stars because, well, because of the instructions to put it simply. I loved it for use on my body, and it made my face cry tears of insane red blistery mitten-sadness.....  And here is why.....<br /><br />I purchased this to be used on my body, but as WELL as on my face as the product explicitly states that it \\"removes blackheads\\" etc. and is intended for use on the face.<br /><br />I THOROUGHLY read through the instructions, as well as the emails I received before I even got the product. It does say to be weary of the amount of pressure you use in sensitive skin areas, but does not explicitly state a duration of time for use or how to use on your face.... so I went at it.<br /><br />Info: I exfoliate REGULARLY, I am not a newbie. And my skin is very resilient, I would never ever consider it 'sensitive' or 'thin' or 'mature' skin that I would take caution with. In fact, I throw pretty much anything at it and it's fine....<br /><br />The email instructions state you should 'not see large rolls of skin come off your face as you would other areas of your body, but you should still feel small balls of skin'. And I didn't, so I kept rubbing... And then I thought, you know, this isn't working at all. I don't have any skin \\"balls\\" coming off my face at all....<br />So then I tried it on my body, and it DID work. I thought eh maybe it was just my face.<br /><br />Yeah. No.<br />A few hours later my skin was HOT, red, buuuuuuuuuuuurning and I felt the intense feeling of \\"ohhhhh ***** what happened here\\" .... I woke up this morning and I had to go to make an emergency dermatologist visit because not only does it appear that I have \\"rug burn\\" alllllllllll over my face, but the top layer of skin is basically gone in some areas of my face.<br /><br />Let's just say the derm looked at me, said \\"Oh wow. Well, we can fix this\\" and I left with a prescription to help heal it, maybe in a week she said. Yaaaaaaay.<br /><br />So while it worked good on my body, I have to say that I would be PETRIFIED to use it on my face EVER again. Maybe it's my skin, maybe it was the length of time I exfoliated for, but all I know is that my face BURNS and HURTS and it's all because of a mitten.<br /><br />***EDITED TO YPDATE******<br />I actually replied to the seller's email asking me if I'd received my mitten and explained that I received a huge gigantic ouchie mess of face from the mitten. She offered apologies and sent me a \\"lite\\" version to use on my face.<br />Now, I haven't used the mitten on my face again, nor the Lite version as I haven't yet gotten it, but the customer service was at least well done as she even offered some natural remedies for my freak-face condition. (which healed in just over 5 days)<br /><br />But with that being said, I am still scared of trying it again on my face.....<br /><br />And for those who wanted to know - it didn't actually hurt that badly when I was scrubbing, which is the scary part. It was obviously VERY easy for me to over-do it... Granted I DO have a VERY high pain tolerance, but I also expected a slight stinging as the instructions state it could feel 'red or tingly' from the exfoliation...
B00028LV4Y|5|GREAT PRODUCT I USE IT EVERY DAY NICE ON THE HAIR LONG LANGLASTING GOOD ON MY MY HAIR WOULD GET IT AGAIN
B000QV8KNW|5|Great product at an amazing price.  The shipping was fast.  Excellent seller.
B000LNB8HK|2|Lubricates the blade, but does not cool down the blade. I wanted something to cool the blade so that I could continue to groom my dog without waiting for the blade to cool.  This product did not do the job. If you are just looking for lubrication, this product will work for that.
B002H950DO|5|I keep coming back to this product/color. After searching my local drugstores for a few weeks and not being able to find it, I purchased two--that ought to last me for a while!
B004Z1V0LS|3|Gave me the wrong item... but quick and easy exchange. satisfied.
B00IIB82FS|5|I am always in desperate need for an eye serum that helps with puffiness and dark circles around my eyes. This stuff is great it is all natural and packed full of all natural and organic materials. This will firm up your skin and fix any fine lines and wrinkles that you may have. It helps to control the puffiness in your eyes and dark circles that you may have. It is really light and not to heavy on your face. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.
B00CFT28G8|5|I purchased this at the same time I purchased the Day Cream.  It arrived nearly a week later than the day cream.  Apparently because it was shipped from a different distribution center?  I began using it immediately.  I don't remember to use it some nights, but have been using it fairly regularly.  I like the fact that it is light, not greasy and it absorbs completely.  Since I use it in conjunction with the Day Cream I'd have to give both products a two thumbs up.<br /><br />Due to a shipping issue, through Amazon, NOT SUBLIME BEAUTY, I was unable to read the directions on how to use it.  So I am 'winging' it by applying it around my eyes, between my eyebrows and around the mouth, where most of the lines and wrinkles are prominent.  I do see results.  The finer lines have all but disappeared, the deeper set wrinkles have softened.  I just ordered another bottle.<br /><br />I am urging my husband to try these products as well.  But you know men.  Bet he'll sneak some when I'm not looking!<br /><br />Thank you Sublime Beauty for a product that does what is says it's going to do.  Keep up the good work.
B00D76IRXQ|4|Package arrived sooner than I expected. The brush looks exactly as it does in the Photo and is very dense and soft. I'm very happy with the product thus far. The bristles haven't shed and In my opinion its just as good or better than the Sigma Version.
B0000DK5LW|5|Don't know how I would survive now without this little device! I use this everyday for several areas. Its a gem.
B00K0RW7MW|5|One of the best eyelast adhesives on the market that i have tried.  glue is white, but drys clear and stays!
B006C7VS06|5|I love it, it fits great everytime I wear this I get compliments. I will buy a few more.
B00BJRKAEE|5|very spacious book bag . my daughter loves it and shes in middle school.
B00AT9BKR4|1|It does not work, shorts out and the cover on the keyboard it hard to try to type on, and it costs 25.oo to send back so just kinda stuck, will never order from you again, and will let friends know. It looked really nice, but I have seen ones so much better, Diane
B000EGSF16|5|My traincase from Sephora holds all my makeup. But I am the sort of person who buys lots of products, but then  I keep coming back to the same old favorites again and again. One such product is BareEscentuals liner shadow, which I put on using this marvelous brush.<br /><br />As you can see in the photo, the brush has two ends. I use the liner end for applying the powder wet; when it has dried, I use the thicker end to smudge the line and create a soft, smoky eye. I have had Stila's #28 brush for a year now and I use it literally every day. I wash my makeup brushes every week too, and #28 has held up beautifully.<br /><br />Worth every penny; love it!!
B00QUJLFR2|5|Perfect!!! Excellent quality
B0025ZANNC|5|I just have to write a review on this stuff. The ingredients are so pure and beautiful and hydrating for my dry, unruly hair. It smoothes, softens, shines, and detangles. I use the shampoo which is great as well, then put on the conditioner and clip my hair up and finish the rest of my routine, then rinse. After the first use, my hair was completely transformed. The curls all fell into place and the split ends didn't even show! I'm getting a trim next week and was going to add on a deep condition treatment but now I won't even have to! And the bottles are 16 oz, absolutely ginormous. I am so happy to have found these products and can't wait to see how nice my hair gets after using them on a regular basis. Highly recommend!!
B004CNE98K|4|The color was slightly metallic...I wasn't expecting it.<br />Still a nice color
B003WWMUW4|5|The atomized spray is very fine.  It us working well.
B00N4UXI6G|5|I recently ordered 2 jars of this product and contacted the seller as I did not notice a difference yet however I was contacted immediately and was so impressed with the customer service and advice.  I need to use this 6-8 weeks and will leave more information after that time but so far love the special and so easy to use.  Nicely packaged too.  Hope it works as I really was impressed with the customer service and so hard to find that today buying online.  I will give this 5 stars as product is reasonable, goes on easily, smells great as I love the minty smell and amazing customer service.  Thank you.
B00BCRLQKI|5|Most beautiful smell ever!!!
B005Y2ASAG|5|There is absolutely nothing I would alter in the formulation, or the container. It isn't girly smelling so we can all use it. These days, there are so many harmful cleansers, this is the only one that is entirely free of scary toxins which won't get you any cleaner. It is costly but you only need a tbsp.or two to clean an adult male, less for your little ones.
B00V2QLIUW|5|Awesome product and got a huge discount through Elite deal club
B006BG3JPA|5|As I write this review, the essence and aroma of C.O. Bigelow No. 32 Bay Rum is caressing my senses like no other cologne I have used before. Masculine, non-alcohol, herbal, woodsy ingredients combine for a sublime sensation. My wife loves it (that's a plus) too. No longer is the 3.4 fl oz bottle available at Bath & Body Works. A 2.5 fl oz is, here and directly from the manufacturer. The inflated price you see is of course ludicrous. Go search for this cologne. Your ladies will not be disappointed.<br />Highest Recommendation.
B00G9CS2IK|5|Fast delivery and excellent headbands! Won my first 5k in one of these, maybe they bring luck?
B007JPRBCY|5|Great shampoo for thin hair. Also use the light leave in spray conditioner as others are too heavy for my fine hair.
B000WHY8KE|5|I use these bad boys for my eyebrows. I'm a male with some thick brows. These babies make short work of plucking and defining them. I actually have to be careful not to overdue it. Don't even read another review or look at another pair. Choose your color and I promise you will be satisfied. Hell it's a pair of tweezers. And these are the best ones on Amazon.
B003IN5D0I|5|Like this product however it is geared for a younger skin than mine.  I have more wrinkles so it works great as long as I use another product<br />on the most heavily wrinkled skin.  Love the fragrance of this product but for me I need more moisture and a product that will give some lift to<br />my wrinkles.
B006VDRQEI|5|I love this stuff, which I am a big fan of alterna products, however I do use this quite often, exspecially when I just want a few small waves in my stick straight hair, it does add some waves, and it is also easy to use when in a hurry, and to make a messy look, which is really in style right now, this does the trick for the messy look sooo well! and also if you don't have time to fully dry your hair, you can add this, and it will add a little wave, and let your hair dry naturally, and look very cute, and I do that very often! I would recommend this to anybody, it is a must have for me, and I will (hopefully) never be without it!
B0087EC03Q|5|This is a great soap. I've been using it for months and have no complaints. If you want a soap that scrubs, this one does a great job.
B00005A43X|5|works really good
B005AB9ZDW|1|I can describe this product using three words...........cheap, thin, and flimsy!  I wish I didn't have to give it one star.
B002VLZHLI|1|turn my scalp itchy and red..  Discontinued and started using Rogaine and that works fine form is better
B00IS4CPPI|2|I got the same results using a Garnier Fructice product, I was not impressed.
B0095LYRK4|5|This is a great deal, very happy with my purchase. They were great with the item customization as well! Buy with confidence :)
B004A26OI6|5|I love it!  Great value and fast shipping.
B00BXL10Y0|2|Bought this for my wife, she stated that the product did not work, no difference when using this product with mascara or not.  Why use it if it does not make any difference.
B00NVGK7E4|3|I'm using this product for up to 1.5 months and still dont know if it's working or not !!! I'll keep using it hoping to see better results in the future
B00GLFDWZI|5|This soap is fantastic, it doesn't dry my skin out, which is especially helpful in the winter.  The scents are amazing, but not overpowering and the soap seems to last longer for me than other natural soaps I buy at the store.  My grandmother also has dry skin and I have given her the gift set for the past 2 years, she has already told me she can't wait to get her gift this year!
B00009RF1E|2|Wahl is a good brand. I've had other Wahl products and that's why I got another. But, I have to say I am disappointed with this set. The trimmer seems solid and is designed well. Maybe it cuts well too but I didn't even try it for the following reasons.<br />1. This thing is LOUD! Sounds like it might explode after a use or 2 and that made me not want to try it for even a few minutes.  Minus 1 star.<br />2. The attachments seem quite cheap. The adjustable one is a bit hard to get on...and then off. The fact that it is held on in the front by TINY plastic tabs makes me think it is doomed to fail with a few on/off sessions. And, it will barely stay in place on the storage stand. Minus 1 star.<br />3. The other 3 length attachments seem ok but, unless I am just totally inept, I can't figure out how they go in the poorly designed stand. So, for the stand and storage, minus 1 star.<br /><br />Wahl, put a muffler on this thing, redesign the storage stand and the adjustable attachment and charge a couple more bucks. It would be worth it and I probably wouldn't have returned it.
B000LJBZYU|5|This hand cream is wonderful! Hand feels soft, moistened and not greasy.<br />The scent is clean, the cream feels rich yet it absorbs readily into the skin.
B005REOHG2|5|I want to tell you how awesome this product is!  I am 48 years old and June 2014 our 23 year old son died from an epileptic seizure.  Not to make this a downer of a review, but you need to know this so that you can try and understand how badly my crows feet and eyelids have aged in the last 9 months from the constant crying, frowning and puffiness!  I have naturally puffy eyelids that droop over a bit, but with the crying over the last 9 months it has only gotten worse!  Every eyeshadow I tried would have almost completely disappeared by the end of the day.  So, after doing a lot of research, I came across the positive reviews for this product for middle-aged women's eyelids.<br /><br />Even the price point was higher that I usually spend, I bought two colors and blend it onto my eyelids.  I have used it alone as an eyeshadow but it doesn't seem to last as long for me.  But when I use it as a base and apply my eyeshadow over it the results are incredible!  My eyelids which are very crepe-like, are now really smooth with this on and it holds the eyeshadow in place perfectly all day!!!!  I highly recommend it!
B003LKU1KK|1|the product does not work as advertised it does not cut ur hair or mustach not enough power. I will have to eat the 18.00 i paid for this and try and find a better one.  No more Conair products for me!!!!
B00016X1I6|4|i bought this mostly for my hair...because the hairdress cut it very short.  I notice an improvement in my skin tone. I only give four points cos i am still using the first bottle and i have only use 1/4 of it.... will update later as times goes.....
B00PUMEREI|4|Absorbs well in the skin.<br />I personally keep the bottle in the closed drawer since the clear bottle exposes the product to light and potential oxidation.
B005RRBR9O|1|Caused rash and redness on my face.  Since then I've heard from several people that the same thing happened to them
B001CR5VIQ|4|This organizer is nice, but the leather is tight for initial use; I'm sure in the future it will loosen up.  I would have rather the wallet was just a bit more user friendly at the present use.  There isn't a place for a plastic card holder, for cards.  (Business reference, membership, etc)
B002W1PJSI|1|This is NOT the White Shoulders product your mother/grandmother used. The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting. Evyan went out of business in the 80's I believe, and the name White Shoulders was bought by Elizabeth Arden (EA Fragrances) and Perfumes Intl. They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product. Acrid, harsh, with no staying power. Don't waste your money; you will be disappointed. Learn from my experience. I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops. There is also powder.<br /><br />Do not buy unless you see the cursive Evyan signature, a cursive 'E', or the trademark phrase 'The Best the World Has to Offer'. You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box w/cellophane with a $15 price sticker. Be sure it's not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it's on the bottle too. There's even a market for empties, which I used to just stick in my dresser drawers.<br /><br />Now I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders. Looks like the Goodwill box for them!
B000MVOYEK|1|It runs, it smudges, it's not good without an mixing liquid which puts it right up there with the gels and liquid eyeliners.  Besides ladies, Clinique IS BACK!
B007CZE4R6|5|The effectiveness of deodorant is sensational. No residue or stains on the skin or clothes and dries quickly when applied. The scent lasts for long.  \\"I received a product sample, the opinions are mine.\\"
B000E7UDWO|5|good
B0081MQ47C|5|Excellent 2nd one I have bought.
B00113FENI|4|This works better than anything else I have tried.  The only problem I had with it is that it doesn't always hold in all the shavings.  Some of the dust comes out of the cracks.  I'm still glad I purchased it.  Well worth the money.
B00NUIY80C|5|This product is delightful. I use it for a full body bath and I absolutely love how amazing it makes my skin feel afterwards. It's a nice size bottle so you get a lot of bang for your buck and smells wonderful too. I will definitely continue to use this product and explore the numerous uses for it.
B00FZKB51S|3|Good
B0009P4PZC|5|I really like the way it feels on my face. I would continue buying your product. My jar had a space space bubble that didn't fill all the way, but I still would recommend your product.
B00H7KTEZ8|5|If you are going to use this I recommend using it every day with hot water if you really want to get rid of the fungus. you can notice a bit of a difference when you first use it. Like some of the fungus was removed a bit. I also suggest clipping nails as much as possible. Use it once a day for about 15-20 minutes or until the water gets cold up to you. Don't stop using it otherwise fungus will come back. I will post update and pics of progress once its gone so far 1 week of usage
B000OP5D8K|5|My go-to summer sunscreen. I'm usually generous and will share sunscreen when asked.  But not this one.
B000I1OMPU|2|It is a good product. But, way too expensive and you don't get much product in the tube. I like how it went on with using the brush-that was nice. Need \\"More product\\" less fancy packaging.
B002NL8C54|5|I bought the travel size kit to test the product before taking the plunge and buying the larger size bottles. I have very mild adult acne, usually one to two blemishes per week.<br /><br />I have not had one single pimple since I began using it three 1/2 weeks ago. I am sold!
B00WFGUYA8|5|I put the Lavender Oil on wool dryer balls, that go in my dryer so my clothes smell wonderful! This also Makes my house smell good.
B00EP49AX0|5|So far I see a difference. I am happy with my purchase.
B00J2AP9F0|5|Thanks to the folks at Gillette, I recently had the opportunity to try the new Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall handle technology in combination with the new Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel.  They claim that the FlexBall razor paired with their new shave gel provides maximum contact and a closer shave in each stroke.  After about a month of use, here are my impressions:<br /><br />The gel: the sample that I received came in “Active Sport” scent, which is an awesome aroma.  It was subtle but appealing—just the right amount of fragrance.  Even more impressive was the cooling sensation that I felt immediately upon application.  It has a chilling tingle that makes the shaving experience much more enjoyable—the best part is that it lingers after rinsing off the gel providing comfort and moisture long after the shave is done.  What I found most fascinating was the innovative design of the container—it’s plastic with a viewing window which means no more rust rings on the counter or running out of shave gel at the wrong moment!  It also comes with a unique twisting top that blocks the opening should you ever need to pack the gel for travel—which I did during my testing—and it kept my toiletry bag mess-free, something I can’t say with other shave gels that I have traveled with in the past.  The only negative to this is the claim of “post shave goo” on the top of the container.  Though it was an improvement over other gels I have used, the foam crud that accumulates was still present post-shave.<br /><br />The blades: this is where this product really shines.  The claim of maximum contact and a closer shave in one stroke are no exaggeration.  My first shave with the new blades required just one pass over each area of my face and the end-result was the smoothest shave I have ever had—not having to pass over the same area multiple times made it an incredibly quick shave as well! I credit the lubrication strip included on the cartridges as well as the new shave gel which goes on smooth and easy.  Throughout the entire shave I could feel the layer of protection that remained on my skin stroke after stroke—no nicks, cuts, or razor burn after using this product.<br /><br />Conclusion: the Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razor paired with ProGlide 2-in-1 shave gel is a package that lives up to all of the hype.  Pricing on this shaving system, including refill cartridges, is comparable to other products but the value of what you get for your hard earned dollar goes further with Gillette.  This combo of razor and gel is truly the best a man can get.
B001F2F4GC|5|Mom, loved them!
B007Q0WW0S|5|I first tried this oil with the flat iron and I love it. It makes your hair quite soft and shiny.
B00B1ZRTP2|5|I buy makeup that I like. It can be from  Wal mart or Neiman Marcus.  The makeup is Neiman Marcus quality at a Walmart price.
B00DCCT4OQ|5|I'm addicted to this fragrance. I'll always buy Kiss.
B003AYEFMC|5|Like the Clairol Balsam Hair color. I have been using this color and product for over a year, works great and covers the gray very well and lasts and does not fade out and looks like my natural hair color before the gray. I dye my hair about once every 2 weeks as the gray roots start to show as my hair is short. One bottle works for two dying processes I just divide the two units in another bottle and mix and save the other half for the next dye job. The price is great and even better when they give you a $2.00 off coupon to use. Wife also uses this brand in another color and looks very natural on her too.
B00GLP533C|5|Best natural vitamin oil-I add to my moisturizer and/or use by itself. Sinks in well, and very safe for sensitive skin. Smooths lines and wrinkles naturally without any harmful ingredients. Highly recommend!
B003V360NY|4|I have to say Philips. Has brilliant service. I bought this for my husband, he likes it but found the there is something wrong with charger. We went through at least three rounds with customer service people and changed every part of this product to figure out what wrong with. We finally get it fixed. For sure, I prefer the product came perfectly the first place.
B003S516XO|5|This iron works great! I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00006IV22|5|Performs as expected, light weight ,compact and presently looking forward to significant durability.<br />Believe the price was appropriate. Good Buy!
B00K72XJ4A|4|I am a novice to diffusing essential oils, and I'm on a strict budget right now, so this was a perfect intro device. It works and works well - my only complaint is it is your typical cheaply made in China product. Not exactly sturdy or heavy duty, but it will suffice for a starter diffuser for me.
B0027MM0U2|4|product as described
B000FIFJBM|5|I really like this product and continue to repurchase. Its non-irritating, more natural than most eye makeup removers out there and it works!
B003VTWXJI|5|Great for the hands in a cold weather. It smells good too. Worth the money and time to order. Also, large enough to have it for very long time.
B000N2IGWY|5|for my daughter curl hair is good
B0009OBYAW|2|I bought this cleanser because I enjoy using some of the other Sothys products.  I have extremely oily skin, even at the age of 49.  I had been using my dermatologist's cleanser, but thought I'd give this Sothys product a shot.  I used it years ago and thought I'd try it again.  Unfortunately it didn't cleanse nearly as well as my derm product.  I need a product that really strips my skin of dirt and oils.  This product cleans okay, but it's nothing special.  Will not be using this again.
B003S516XO|4|I already own a Bio Ionic One Pass 1.5&#34; flat iron and I'm thrilled with the results I get from using it. The reason I still purchased this hair straightener is to work as a substitute flat iron when I'm traveling, as it would cause me major stress to travel with the Bio Ionic incase it gets lost in baggage handling or something worse! Needless to say, this straightener had to stand up to some very high standards since I'm used to the results of the One Pass which is truly a man made miracle!<br /><br />First off, the Remington S5500 looks good and heats up fast. The digital controls are easy to use and basic which is what's required anyway right! I did find that there was slight pulling when I straighten my hair, but it was minimal and didn't affect the results either. I did a side by side comparison of this flat iron and the Bio Ionic on either sides of a center parted hair style, and the results were very similar! I needed an extra pass with this straightener but that's a small price to pay- ofcourse it will take me a little longer than the usual 15 minutes it normally takes me to get my mid back length hair straight. (I have thick, long hair but have perfected the art of getting it straight quickly). A good heat protectant is definitely very important to use with this straightener because of the pulling, but otherwise its a great product for the price.
B0040BK082|4|I have this for doing my own gel nails....  So far, it works great!  Very light and portable.  Fits one hand at a time...
B001A43ELC|5|I have tried so many different products for removing hair, including various wax kits from other brands, but this is the only one I love and the only one I unreservedly recommend!! It is so gentle, and best of all....easy!! Microwave, spread it on, rip it off, done. I use it for upper lip waxing, as well.
B004E6309E|5|I ordered this product as it was recommended to me by a few people. I got this order on time and it smells really good and stays for long...I already gifted Davidoff cool water to my boyfriend and now I am trying Davidoff cool water for women. Trust me its a good product with a good value for money.
B003BQIZX4|4|My wife likes it, I don't!
B001STB0MO|3|Vendor shipped this quickly and on time, no problems. I have color treated hair and this did not do as well as others I have used.
B0030T18CW|5|love this stuff
B001HK04BW|5|best product I ever try for its purpose , will always suggest to others for good quality and effectiveness thank you
B00A2TDUW4|4|This product is super easy to use and better quality than I expected. I would definitely recommend it. If you are contemplating on what systems you get and weighing the Glam Air out with more expensive systems, this one is definitely a good competitor.
B002QSD1YQ|2|I have purchased this product before but this was not what I normally received.  The cream is an odorless moisturizer.  It is really white in nature.  The previous cream had a excellent fragrance.  Was white but had a white clear, kind of nature.  I am disappointed that either the product has changed or that it is not clear about which product is on line.  I should have a history with the company and would like to know what product is the one I really want.  Plus it took forever to get to me.
B000UJZIEY|5|After about three months of ownership, I still love this shaver!  It is the best Norelco I have ever had out of a total of five Norelcos owned.  The shave is closer than any other electric shaver and my skin feels soft afterwards thanks to the lotion.  It is also way cheaper than the Arcitec shavers that are quite frankly overpriced.  The charging and lotion refill stand does a great job.  I didn't want to bother with doing the lotion refill by hand and the stand does the job flawlessly with no mess.  The lotion cans are very convenient.    Other people have mentioned that the hairs fall out of this shaver.  I have never had this problem.  They stay inside until the shaver is rinsed out under the faucet.  I have used the shaver in my car when running late and do not worry about hairs getting all over the place.  Using the lotion while shaving means that the hairs stay inside the shaver.
B0040JIBIU|5|I gave this to my step son for Christmas and he really liked how it was color coded.
B000Z8YTMW|5|I am currently having some serious skin problems on both of my legs (from a candida skin fungus). The bottom line is the integrity of the skin on my legs have been severely comprised. I have scars that are black, ugly and itch something awful. I had to stop wearing shorts by mid July. I heard about MSM and through research I decided to try some skin care products which contain MSM. I washed my legs with this soap (after spending a small fortune attempting to find a soap that not only would not irritate my skin but would alleviate the intense itch), after one use of the soap, which was slightly and mildly irritating initially, my legs did not itch all day and they looked better. When I used the soap the next day it was less irritating. I then applied some cream and lotion that I ordered that contain MSM. You will need to make sure that MSM is one of the first three ingredients in the product. I have since ordered three more bars. If you research the ingredients in the soap, there are natural ingredients that promote skin health. MSM, according to my research has antifungal and antibacterial properties with a high amount of sulfur that is suppose to be very beneficial for the skin. The soap is pricey but as we all know it costs to be healthy.
B000FQNQXM|5|I use it for simple toner mask everyday! Love it so much! I will repurchase!
B0007X74OK|4|Quick drying...no flakey residue...pretty good hold...easy to brush out. 4 stars because it's pricey and may not be something I buy regularly but a go to for me for important hair styles.  If you have the money...go for it!
B00NBZQ726|2|not a very good shave
B005FAP50U|5|Excellent service. Received quickly. The smell never leaves your hair and it is wonderful. Love how soft and shiny my hair is when using these products.
B0029XBNAW|5|This product is awesome. My gums are in much better shape and have stopped bleeding. I highly recommend it!!!
B0013LUPQY|5|fav shampoo
B000KGRNMM|5|Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.
B0046VGPHQ|5|I am the self tanner queen! I never have time to go tanning and when I saw this product on youtube.com I just had to try it! It does not come out orange, the smell is great (because you know that self tanners can have a weird after smell), and it is so easy to apply! If you are unsure just youtube it like how I did!
B000I1TNBS|1|The compartment on this unit is poorly designed.  Once you insert batteries it is impossible to remove them unless you use a knife or thin flat-head screw driver.<br /><br />Get the [[ASIN:B000FJ9M5K WAHL 9962-717 Compact Travel Trimmer]].  It takes a single battery instad of 3, battery compartment is well designed, and it actually cuts noticeably better than this big clunky unit.
B001ARUX8G|4|Good price!!
B001TVURZW|3|I have been using john frieda products  and they were good and perfect. I decided to change for this one, my hair hasn't been feeling very good using this one.It was a ok smell in the shower and a good lather.
B002XQ1TCM|5|This cologne is really nice. I got it for my boyfriend and I love it on him! I will definitely purchase it again
B002TD6I8O|3|Although it came in time, this lotion arrived piping hot, like it had been sitting in the sun for a long time. Makes me wonder if it will retain its effectiveness and still be useable.
B00K08QCGS|2|The lipstick looks good but when i put it on my lips, it becomes very dry and even makes it hard to move my lips. I wish it could maintain it moisture instead of drying ones lips.
B005EWF284|5|muy buen producto
B00BB8KSYS|4|good product, this is my second bottle.
B001UTK76C|5|I remember older Jergens working well but having an awful smell. This must be a new formula because it's much improved. Light pleasant scent when applying that wears off quickly. I personally think all &#34;firming&#34; moisturizer is bulls***. Want firmer thighs? Do some squats. But the gradual tanning aspect works great! Very natural looking.
B00CMHSO2K|5|This is my all time favorite.  It's all I wear.
B00N996X4G|5|So far I have only been using this product for over a week and I love the feel, smell, and just the way my puffy eyes seem to respond to the cream. I am hoping that after continued use it will help with the wrinkles.  Thank you so much!
B000V2FB88|5|It does what it's meant to do- be an oil cleanser! It's a little thinner than what I'm used to, but it still serves its purpose and for its price, what could be better than that?
B00365DABC|4|I have purchased this on Amazon and also at CVS/Walgreens drugstores. I normally wear Murad or Darphin moisturizers at night, which are available only at Neimans or Nordstrom, but I use CeraVe during the day. It's not too thick to wear under suncreen and it's not greasy at all, that's why I love this stuff. I know it says it's for nighttime use, but I find it's great during the day. Put it on your neck and decolletage...under sunscreen, of course. I love the pump, too, which makes it easy to dispense.<br />NOTE: they have new packaging, it doesn't look like the picture (above) anymore. It's in a white box and it says &#34;new look&#34;
B00AE078YM|3|Prior to trying the [[ASIN:B00AE078YM Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes]] I've liked and used several Clear hair products in my home.  I have naturally curly, mid-back length, color treated hair; so keeping it moisturized is very important. My normal routine has me conditioning it everyday in the shower, but only shampooing it 3 times a week.  I have found this the easiest way to keep it from drying out and becoming frizzy.  Because I wanted to test this product the way it was recommended, I changed up that routine and shampooed every day and then followed up with the treatment for the full 7 days.  The first 3 days my hair felt great and I was impressed, but when days 4, 5, 6 and 7 came I noticed my hair feeling more and more oily. Even with the daily shampooing, this product seemed to be leaving residue in my hair that was weighing it down and making it look greasy.  At the end of the week I had to wash my hair several times to remove it and get it back to an acceptable state.  So while I do like the product for the effect it had on my hair after 3 days, I think for some 7 days is too much and it may be best to break the treatment package up into two and maybe use them once a month.
B007HJ9VFM|1|cheap, broke within 3 months
B0088PWUFW|5|[[VIDEOID:mo367GDT6EUGPQ0]]Yes. This phenomenal body butter not just moisturizing my skin but it is tightening too. When I opened the jar I saw it has 2 colors: white and brown. The white layer is moisturizing and nourishing, and brown layer tightens, firms, and heals, so it's 2 in 1. So cool , I've never seen it before ! I use it all over my body and especially for my problem areas - neck, underneath of my arms and for the lower back. This body butter is also paraben free - no preservatives and it contains argan oil in it, which is very good for the skin. Very mild, soft scent so it doesn't bother when I use it like the rest of the creams.
B000V4QZG8|5|This shaver works very well.  It's made of a material that's easy to grip and is the right size for fitting in the bikini area.  I really like the trimmers on the sides.    Bottom line: Can't beat this shaver
B0094C36WY|5|delicious
B001MNBXQY|1|This hair was soft, lovely,  but shedded so much I took it out after a month.  Never to be used again.
B004JMKQYK|5|This oil is great.. Love this product you can use it all over your body..hair,face,skin, nails, etc...<br />I love my coconut oil... : )
B0036ELTTI|1|It worked for almost one year then quit working. It makes a clicking sound when you put it on the charger and won't charge.  Doesn't anything last anymore?
B0084NXDA4|5|I never bought hair before always wanted to. So ones at I found this and loved it so I got it and fell In love with it. It's the best.
B00AHF1GK6|5|Best Disposable Razor out there no doubt about that! It exceeded my expectations for a disposable, yet! it gets the best close shave without drying your skin out. Not to mention the flip and trim feature that allows for easier trimming made everything just a little better
B003TQTFVW|4|As a guy,  i don't have a long mane of thick hair. So, my satisfaction with this unit is mainly from my perspective. I like the size and the handle that folds for packing in luggage. It is strong enough that i only need it for about sixty seconds a day.
B00K4PLC30|5|Received my product sooner than expected. Read great reviews, cant wait to try it out😁
B00I073NF4|5|It's working, my dark spots are fading and I only started using it at the beginning of August.  I will definitely recommend this product.
B00FW9GTUY|5|My son loved it. Hugh Carolina Fan.
B000VOLLG2|4|I liked it, but my wife said it smelled like lighter fluid.
B000C1W3OS|5|good
B002WLWX82|1|I ordered this item specifically because it was from Dr. Scholl.  In the instructions it says that it takes 120 minutes for the wax to heat up.  I attempted to use it twice but after waiting over 5 hours each time for the wax to melt I never got the chance to use it.  Returned.
B00L2PB3BW|5|Such a great product! Will definitely continue to use.
B001CE9Y6Y|5|I absolutely love the scent of Fizzy Pop incense. I prefer putting them around my home kind of like potpourri, as they leave my home smelling just like them! Burning them is also nice, but I do prefer their original scent. Be sure to keep these in a sealed bag when you aren't using them, though, as they will dry up if they're left out for too long.
B0043NSR2I|4|Super conflicting information on this thing first of all... Parts of the site said 100% organic when I bought it (though none of the packaging did - now the sight says 100% natural >.<). I can tell you that on the actual bottle there is not one thing about natural or organic.     Now for the positive: It works. Not great, but it works. I don't like all the hormone changers in normal shave gel and stuff, and I can normally only use the sensitive ones. I don't get bumps with this and it doesn't hurt my face or other... areas..     Negative!!: It only just works. Hair grows back faster because like another review said it doesn't actually get down to the root it creates too large of a lubricated surface area.    All that being said I've had this for 7 months. I shave my face every couple days, and other parts once a week. I'm not even half way through the bottle yet. So it's looking like a 12$/year cost... THAT is awesome!
B000VCN6KI|1|very harsh on my skin. I love their cleanser, but this toner is way too harsh and abrasive on my skin.
B000QU3ZBA|5|Bummer Mary Kay ever dropped this!! I loved it and used it for years!!
B0018BT8DU|2|the product smells good and it arrived very quickly but I have been using it for a month now faithfully and I don't see any difference
B00K669P2W|5|As listed and arrived timely.
B00383W3JW|5|Love this stuff!
B007Y7PVDS|1|They are to sharp easy to work with but I broke my real finger nail under neath so be carefull
B003983I1S|5|Ok so you must be thinking these cartridges are way to much money, there is no way I am going to purchase that razor. Well think again my friend. These razors are fantastic not only do they have Thinner, finer blades with a low-resistance coating that replace the tug and pull of shaving with an effortless glide. There is a small little razor at the end of the blade called a MicroComb it guides stubble directly to the blade getting me a extremely soft smooth shave. I love the fact that if I want to use it in the shower I can and I wont ruin the handle end itself. I also love the fact that I can shave, and not have that itchy feeling after I do when I use some other razor blade brands. This product truly is a fantastic product. I am thankful that I got a free sample through a program ran by Gillette.
B0087K2S46|4|Donne de la lumière.
B008L61734|1|not very good quality. Smells very very processed and plastic-y. Its also extremely stiff. Ended up using it for storage rather than travel.
B000HK1OOY|5|Good to use with essential oils.  Very gentle.
B00AWKQWI2|4|My doctor recommends this, and it has really helped with sensitivity.  I hate the little foil cover they put under the cap.  Seems overkill to me since the box is sealed shut.
B008YM6WY4|5|So, so great!
B003AORK5Q|4|It feels very light with almost no sunscreen-stickiness.  However, I echo what others have said that it does not last long.  I use it when I am going to have limited sun exposure that is too much to wear no sunscreen, but I don't want to get all sticky with other stuff.  It also does not stain so you can wear it with dressier clothes.  This is not a good choice for prolonged sun exposure, especially if you will sweat since this is not waterproof at all.  Definitely re-apply every 2 hours or so.
B00IP42FBA|4|I have been using this on my hands and love it! My hands get super dry and cracked during dry weather and it has helped my hands. I plan on using this on my face and will definitely re-review the product.
B00005O0MZ|5|I buy cheap. I don't need anything fancy, just something that gets the job done. This works great! Gets at right temperature comes with attachments. It's better than a $30 one my sister bought.
B00GMP8874|5|Wife loves and make her hair feels sooo good!
B004XNPE9C|4|I like this hairspray because it is moisturizing.  Due to the argan oil it contains, it's one of the only hairsprays on the market that does not dry my hair out.  However, that's where my love affair with it ends.  I have a lot of long, fine, wavy hair.  This hairspray is good to tame flyaways, but it has a tendency to weigh your hair down, especially if your hair is fine.  I have also tried spraying it on my hair after curling my hair with hot rollers, and although it looks good at first, the hairspray does not have good hold.  If it holds my curls for 20 minutes, I'm lucky.  I love the shine this hairspray provides, and I like the fact that my hair feels healthy after using it.  But if you are looking for long lasting volume and hold, this is not the spray for you. If your hair is dry or damaged, this would make a good texturizing spray.  It will add grip and shine, but will not necessarily hold a wave or curl well.
B0089L0M2S|5|Nice kit. The tools a kinda light, fine for home use but probably not for the professional. Has more tools than I know what to do with.
B002MZ8BK2|1|I ordered this and when I finally got it in the mail, the stamper wasn't in the package.. just the receipt!! I was so upset :( when I tried contacting customer service they're taking forever to get back to me. What a rip off.
B002ZNJI9Y|5|My daughter loves this for playing with its hair.
B0077PLNNE|4|good
B006GQYSDC|4|good cheap razor, but it gives me irriation on my neck if I try to get close.<br />Will use it for light touch up work after wetshaving, but will not use primarily on its own.
B00BR2BER8|4|Great colors! Very rich.
B004C20O8A|5|The best incense.  Period!
B00N11J2BS|5|Renata is OEM for many electronics.  These appear to be fresh, and have performed well so far.
B00B6U1JYO|5|Love love love this shampoo!  Very moisturizing and calming for your scalp.  Made my hair feel very soft and clean.  Doesn't weigh your hair down or make it feel greasy.  Would definately recommend if you have a dry flaky scalp.
B00KI3A3K6|5|Wow,  just wow!  I will always buy this!
B00L79L8TA|5|It was very than I thought, it creates an a strong layer over my nails and also the nail polish that I apply over last longer.
B0038SPKQA|5|A good friend let me borrow this amazing scent. In no way does it smell like lemon pledge! There is an amazing lime-citrus scent with underlying peppery notes. Over time, the lime scent diminishes while the peppery notes remain. It's a wonderful masculine scent. When sprayed on the chest and lightly applied to the neck, the scent lasts an entire work day.
B00LA4NWRS|5|I love my new little make-up bag.  I am one of those freaks that likes everything in my handbag organized.  I have my Excedrin, Chill Pill Oil, cough drops, fingernail clippers and nail polish in this cute little bag.  It is adorable and has a conveniet  flat bottom so that you can really open it up and see all your stuff inside.  It is very well made, they didn't cheep out!
B00D879BFW|5|Love it
B00AQZFXI8|4|I have the lotion also and together the fragrance is wonderful.  Really like both of them.  Would make a great gift.
B00BP5DFL0|1|I am disappointed at this product, it took very long to be delivered and now that it has finally been delivered, it doesn't work . I don't recommend it.
B00CMFMQCG|5|Very satisfied.  Color is nice although it doesn't match this picture it is pretty.
B00IJQDZTU|4|Even though I only received 3 of the 4 tubes I love this product. I wrote Amazon and they gave me my money back but I will probably buy again
B001EBN7ZE|2|When this product first came I thought finally...I natural powder and it looked like it was &#34;translucent&#34; &#34;porcelain&#34; as advertised. It's not. It's too dark for my face and the price is high, so not happy with this. If you have very fair skin do not get this unless you want your face darker/tan looking (which to me looks rather unnatural on very fair skin). Very disappointed as I thought I finally found my natural face powder. Sigh.
B0000AFUT3|3|I like the size, I like the flip mirror with the magnification on one side. However, the light just isn't bright enough. The lighting where I do my makeup is horrible so I really really was relying on this mirror giving me all the lighting I needed to do my makeup. Now I find when I get to work in bright fluorescent lighting I didn't blend quite well enough because I thought I looked great in my dark room! I guess I will need to buy a new light fixture for my entire bedroom...
B001VFL88Q|5|This mouse is wonderful.  I couldn't find this product anywhere else.<br />I have short hair and it does the trick.  Keeps my hair full of body all day.<br />Thank you.
B007ZXR4I6|5|I wanted to purchase my teenage daughter a quality flat iron and looked around a lot before deciding on this one. The ratings by users were better than the Chi flat irons.<br /><br />I would, and already have, recommend this flat iron to others. My daughter has very thick, very fine hair and it is great. Her hair has a tendency to be frizzy but after using this it is smooth and shiny. The last flat iron I purchased took forever to straighten her hair but not with this one. It is not an exageration to stay that it only takes a quarter of the time that it did previously.
B00CWUGX6G|5|Use these today love them.
B00E3AZPHQ|1|This stuff is awful,  I really don't understand what other people are smelling, when they say It has a fruity or bubblegum fragrance. it smelled like sweat in a bottle as soon as i opened it!
B004DH00CY|5|I just love the dove body mist
B002H6X6SI|5|KS moisturizers are non-greasy, easily absorbing and healing.  I love them. Pure too!  Not too pricey and last a long time.  Highly recommend.
B000XE5M06|5|this is easily the best - warmest most wonderful scent ever
B000LREL0W|4|always the best-little expensive
B0034CXMME|5|The savex is at a really good price.  I think it's the best price anywhere.  I highly recommend Savex.  My wife and I love it.  We will be ordering again.
B00G15STU6|5|Very good
B0067H6G26|5|the best
B00GTK90R4|4|Good eyelash curler. The space is smaller than any one I've used before, but it doesnt cause any problems. It only takes an extra second to make sure everything is lined up before curling.
B00NZR534S|4|Looks great! A bit long for my taste. I would like the wig to have a fuller appearance. A few hairs fell out, but that is to be expected. Great product for the price!
B008B9L6WS|2|This product is too thick for the pump and it is impossible to get all the lotion out of the bottle!!  I worked for hours to empty it into 2 jars but I know there was some left in the bottle when I disposed of it.  Perhaps the solution would be to package in a jar instead of that costly useless bottle!  It's a waste of money!
B00243FKRO|5|Tresemme 24 hour body finishing spray is wonderful!! When your hair is all done this finishing spray just completes it. My hair lasts all day, unbeliveable.
B0007M10Q4|5|As a man with sensitive skin, I've found this deodorant to stave off odor while not irritating my underarms. A little pricey when compared to its discount store brethren, but for me at least, absolutely worth the cost.
B004DK7DVC|4|This is a more modern version of Sun-In. It does work, but it WILL damage your hair, just as any other bleach or highlighting chemical would, and even worse than a lot of other products. Go Blonder uses peroxide to lighten, which is nothing new and really no surprise.<br /><br />You can use this with minimal damage, if you take it slow. Don't try to achieve your desired look the first time you use it, or you will most likely end up with really damaged hair and pretty upset.<br /><br />If you are going to use this along with a straightener or hair dryer, be careful. Do not totally soak your hair with it and then excessively blow dry or straight iron - that is asking for trouble!<br /><br />You have to use it on wet hair. If you spray it on dry hair and then straighten or blow dry, don't be surprised when your hair falls out - no joke!<br /><br />The way I use it, in order to minimize damage, is I spray LIGHTLY, so that it is just misting my hair. Do not hold the bottle too close to your hair, or else you will end up with lightened blotches. Think of it as using hairspray, where you want to mist to cover a lot of area at once. If you want to do root areas or new growth, use the same technique - try to MIST a broad area at a time and do not totally saturate the hair.<br /><br />After you mist, run your fingers through your hair several times to eliminate any over concentrated areas and then also comb through several times. You want it to be distributed evenly through your hair and you do not want any blotches or any areas that are too saturated with it because that's how you end up with more damage.<br /><br />After you have it worked through your hair, you can blow dry or let it air dry. Heat speeds up the process, but will also cause more damage.<br /><br />I do blow dry, but I am super careful to NOT hold the hair dryer on any spot too long. The more exposure to heat, the more damage and guaranteed breakage.<br /><br />Using this more than advised on the bottle will lead to excessively dry, brittle hair. It will become porous and rough, no matter what, but will be even worse with overuse . Be sure to use a GOOD conditioner to counteract all the bad side effects. I'd recommend a salon brand, but if you have to use a store brand, go with Infusium 23 or Loreal EverPure. Keep in mind that you will experience all of these bad side effects even if you use it as directed, so a conditioner that actually replenishes the hair is mandatory.<br /><br />If you are in a hurry to see extreme highlights or lightening, you are better off to buy a highlighting kit, or just dye your hair. If you use too much of this too often, you are just asking for horribly damaged hair. If you take your time with it, use it maybe twice a week (several days apart!) you will be able to lighten your hair with minimal damage.<br /><br />Bottom line is that it does work, and it does work well, you just cannot be in a hurry, you cannot overuse it, you cannot excessively use heat appliances, you cannot expect to get the full results in one use.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend using a straightening iron at all, after using the spray. Hair dryer = damage, but straightening iron = EVEN MORE damage and breakage. Wait at least a day before using a straightening iron, despite what the bottle says.lead to excessively dry, brittle hair.

B00A0J086C|4|This is my husband's first time using Axe shave gel. I was a bit worried that it would have an overpowering smell (as some Axe products do) but it doesn't. It is a light fragrant smell, almost a bit sweet smelling. It made me want to snuggle up to him. It left his face feeling baby soft and he said it felt great on his skin and foams up nicely. It's a winner!
B0073B3F06|2|I started off really liking this shampoo and conditioner. I am a Pantene fan. I have had grey hair for many, many years with no yellowing until I started using this shampoo for about 4 or 5 months. I don't understand what happened. I started searching on internet about grey hair and purple shampoo; found many people saying not to use it every day, only once or twice a week. I was using it everyday. I have since quit using it and went back to regular Pantene shampoo and conditioner. I will try using it again when I can grow the yellowing out of my hair, but only once or twice a month.
B008JWW5K4|2|The picture I saw online wasn't what I got when I ordered, I ordeded 36 brushes and instead I got 15
B000CRAWWC|2|While Sovage works well to soothe chapped lips, I got absolutely no benefit in the plumping department that this product boasts of.  I cannot recommend this product in the least on the basis of its plumping capabilities.  It does provide a nice gloss; however, I can think of a lot of good lip glosses that don't cost the same as a tank of gas.
B00547HWBE|1|is the worst product I ever bought on amazon, not looking for anything like the images of samples. the most serious is that I bought several and I felt cheated when opening the package. I usually organize parties and would never recommend anyone buy them, is false advertising. They look so bad, cheap, horrible, that I threw, I was ashamed to show them or regararlas my guests at the party theme.<br /><br />es el peor producto que he comprado en amazon, no luce para nada parecido a las imagenes de muestras. lo mas grave es que compré varias y me sentí estafada al abrir el paquete. yo suelo organizar fiestas y NUNCA recomendaria a nadie adquirirlas, es una publicidad engañosa. Lucen tan mal, baratas, horribles, que las boté, me daba verguenza enseñarselas o regararlas a mis invitadas en la fiesta tematica.
B000EPJNMW|5|After 20 years of short hair, grew it out & needed something to add a little finish when I have very little time. These rollers are just great! I have a lot of fairly fine hair, was concerned that 8 rollers would not be enough. Eight were plenty! Lots of compliments!
B00AWRHA1S|5|Thanks.
B004KQT68C|5|Fast shipping and the right product for the cheapest price :) The packaging, like someone else did look sketchy but it doesn't matter because it was protected and good when I took it out.
B0042PRNPY|5|Finally, a sunscreen that works without making rosacea flair while providing excellent coverage.
B000GGJCDY|5|These are essential if you have a permanent brace
B004GWVNZO|5|OMG I think I've been using Sebastian Molding Mud for over 20 years now! There definitely is nothing like it. It is actually something between 'honey' and 'mud'. In the container, it sits sort of solid and moist, but breaks down so easily and becomes a bit sticky, with cool 'micro-strands'. You put a little in your hair, and it just keeps moisture, but not too wet. You add more, and it begins to add volume and a bit of wave to your hair. Really nice and natural. It never cracks or feels heavy. It seems to disappear into the hair, enhancing its natural characteristics. It's great that they're still making this.<br /><br />For a stronger 'non-wax' product (something that feels more waxy and super-strong, but not as oily as others), try Sebastian Craft Clay.
B001E5E2BI|5|I have been using this for several years.  Apparently Olay has decided to discontinue it, which really puzzles me.  This cleanser is so mild but yet desolves the makeup right off, including mascara, but does not dry out my skin.  Olay, I hope you read this and bring this product back!  I purchase it on Amazon anytime I can find it and stockpile it!
B00M6I5SNI|5|Takes a little while, but my hair is much thicker on the top. I'm happy to know it works for  me!
B00KQ5MZA2|5|Phyto Skinlift in combination with Vitamin C Serum has made my face visibly improved and the compliments from my co-workers and friends has made me a believer of this product. I plan on being a life time user of this amazing product.
B0039K33ES|5|This is my second year using this lotion I recommend it to any tanner .. You should be and experienced tanner though bc the lotion gets very hot .. Love love love
B00E4PMQAO|5|This is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever used.  Results last for weeks!  I would highly recommend it everybody.
B007SNGSFS|5|Great
B00INMHEUG|3|bueno
B00CSF68VK|3|The problem with this beauty balm is that it looks very un-natural.<br /><br />It looks like melted wax on the face.<br /><br />This is one of the few Avon products that I've been very disappointed in.
B002I7I3AM|3|This product does exactly what the name describes Extreme Hold. Unfortunately, while the hold is fantastic it leaves the hair feeling brittle and hard. I would recommend this hairspray for special occasions when one really needs hair to stay in place for multiple hours and won't be running through their fingers through it but as a day to day spray I would advise using something a little less harsh.
B00CH3SL9A|5|Most Importantly, my wife loves the smell on me!
B00012C02I|5|This item works as well as it should.  I did have to get double sided adhesive to keep it up there, but it is big, if you splash water on it you can see yourself clearly (may take a couple slashes per shower no biggie) and you can definitely turn it to magnify your face.  Most shower shaving products do not work.  This does.
B00OPAYPDO|5|Wonderful serum that accentuate  youthful skin. I'm receiving so<br />Many compliments after using this product.
B00DUTHKII|4|Great smell. Lathers nice.
B003TQU1Q0|5|First of all - let me tell you that I have had eczema (atopic dermatits) my entire life, as long as I can remember. I'm 27 years old. For my entire life I Have used the cetaphil cream that comes in the tub. Killer deal for 20oz tubs at costco. Its good mositurizer, but doesnt do anything to heal. This year, while having a perticularily HORRIBLE flare up (something in the air or something this year, I swear I havent had this bad of skin in 10+ years) I've been trying new moisturizers to try to give some relief after making the choice to get off topical steriods (ugh). I went all natural, tried Shea butter, coconut oil, cold pressed olive oil, infused with lavender essential oils... tried shea moisture chamomile & argan oil eczema therapy, hemp salve.... etc etc, nothing helped, and if anything made my skin worse. My trouble areas are my face, neck, wrists, forearms and inner elbows. I somehow just discovered this Restoraderm lotion (how did I not know of it sooner?!) and tried it. Duh. I've used Cetaphil products as long as I can remember, so I trust it and its worth a shot. Within 3 days I noticed an improvement. As of today i've gone through an entire bottle and am on bottle #2 and I would say I am 75% clearer. Obv its not a total healing... there is a reason why we eczema people have eczema, and its an internal battle of mine trying to find the root cause. But hey - 75% clearer, i will take that any day. YES like everyone else states it BURNS applying if you have open skin and for me it got worse the first day or 2 before It started getting better.<br />For Kids i can understand not being able to use it. But if you can get it on them kiddos and immediately blow on their hot spots to cool the burning... it passes after just a few minutes. Like 2 or 3 mins and it doesnt burn anymore. If they are full body I can see not being able to use it. If your an adult, you just gotta get over the burn, its temporary... you can do it. Those are my opinions, overall i am very satisfied with this product and am setting myself up for re-order. It might be a little more spendy but totally worth it. If i could figure out how to upload a picture, I would post a before/after shot.tisfied with this product and am setting myself up for re-order. It might be a little more spendy but totally worth it.

B006MAMO06|5|The product is always great, but when you can get it for a great price also, that just makes it that much better.
B00I0UG4PM|5|This deodorant is very powerful and has a robust but not overpowering scent that lasts throughout the day. I can do sports and be active and this Speed Stick keeps your back. I just apply it once a day and I don't have to worry about bodily odors. In the contrary, I smell fresh like I just left the shower. Another plus is that it is gentle on the skin. I did not experience any irritation even though it is very powerful. Further, you can hold the the deodorant comfortably as it provides a generous grip and it looks manly and very modern. I would also recommend this deodorant to people with a tight budget as you have to apply just once a day and I saw that a little goes a long way. I suppose that such a deodorant lasts at least a month, so efficient it is.<br />One negative about this deodorant is the aluminum zirconium. I would like to see that replaced.
B00OCN97DW|5|Good stuff
B0051UTNWU|5|Very oriental, my doughter love it.
B00F4VX9G2|4|I am having a difficult time getting the hang of this liner because it is so thick. I still prefer my wet n wild liners for $2 from Wally World!
B005IYZLWU|2|The cap has a cotton liner which I thought would be great, however the lining is not finished so it frays and sheds black fuzz.  When this gets into my wash cloth it is really hard to get off.  It is also sharp on the edges thus not comfortable.
B0012BNVE8|5|1. do not use foam, use extra strength liquid<br />2. shave your head bald every two weeks and apply directly to scalp and rub your head really good.<br />3. it is good adead to apply to your entire head and more to the balding area, it will make your current hair stronger and you will also give a support to the balding area.<br />4. don't wash your head before 4 hours of using rogaine for better result<br />5. finally, results vary but I can say this. if you ignore the result at all and focus on using it the right way plus what I have mentioned above. it will eventually work because it needs lots of time. remember time is always part of the solution in any thing you trying to achieve.<br />6. works for me I been on it for almost 8 months. works really good I think little bit slow but works . for us something always better than nothing .<br /><br />the key is ignore results. focus on using it all the time. twice a day. you will see it coming and you will be happy once again
B009P3DT4C|3|Smells like the beach--like seaweed. If that's ok with you, this is nice stuff.
B000F4W86A|5|I have been using this product for several years now and it really is the best!! I would recommend this to anyone having difficulty staying regular.
B000GREPOY|5|Wow. This product has me using and coming back for more. Did a lot of research on this and this works wonders on skin scars, moisturizing and all the other benefits it mentions. Highly recommended. A+++
B004UQ6Q62|5|Good deal
B003AKZCPU|5|I love it!
B00FPKJ1JQ|1|I think if you iron them they'd be ok some of the rhinestones were glued on Lopsided
B001A43ELC|5|I got this about a week ago, but I have been putting off using it until last night.<br />I have never gotten a professional Brazilian before, as I just can't see myself dropping $80 to have some one rip hair out of my nethers, but I was curious to do it myself. Honestly, my results were WAY better than expected. I am super happy that I bought this, as this will probably be my new &#34;hair down there&#34; maintenance routine.<br /><br />There will be some trial and error, here were some of mine.<br /><br />*Tips*<br />Don't forget the oil! It hurts like mother if you don't put this on first<br /><br />Tiny bits at a time - its more time consuming but works better.<br /><br />Use a towel you don't mind ruining and keep a wastebasket close by or you will have wax pieces everywhere<br /><br />Don't put on the wax super thick. If you do, it may feel hard on top but still be soft underneath. Ripping off soft wax hurts and is super messy.<br /><br />If you want to keep any sort of hair patches, be SUPER careful that you don't accidently drip wax on the hair. If you do, consider it gone.<br /><br />Go bottom to top - The thing that hurt the most was the hair ripping out when I was peeling back the first bit to grab on to. If you put a little wax over an area that is hairless or has already been waxed, then you can peel the bit off without slowing ripping anything else. This is probably the #1 tip I can give because this caused me the most grief.<br /><br />Besides the fact that this is messy as hell and required frequent re-heating, way better and cheaper than a professional. Highly recommend!
B007HJFV5G|5|Very goods
B0082C55RQ|5|Flawless eliminates the conditioning process after shampooing. Leaves hair nice and silky. Great for my chemical treated hair!<br />1 step
B005LNZWZ4|5|You do have to put a lot of coats on. It turns out to be a pretty green and its so cool in the dark. It glows really bright.
B000X1YIOU|5|Great product.  These are just what I was looking for - and are exactly like the ones given to me after receiving a facial.  Received timely + reasonably priced.  Thanks!
B0037HP9OA|4|I must admit that I was hesitant to buy this product. The idea of razors in my man zones made me a little uneasy. However, it faded after I used it the first time.  The coolest things about the Norelco are that it is 2 sided. You can have a smooth shave or a trim. I've put both to the test. The trimmer side is much more effective when dry (great for trimming underarms) and the shaver side is great both dry and wet. I prefer to use it in the shower. The most important lesson I learned is to really take it slow on the sensitive parts. The first go I nicked myself a few times. Other than that there have been no complaints.  Oh, and it is really easy to clean. Both sides of the Norelco pop off or up (in the case of the trimmer) to allow for easy cleaning.  The only downside is that if you are pretty hairy and slow going you may run out of juice before you are done. I've come close a few times.
B00AB6D898|5|LOVE IT
B001441WNA|2|I have used Silk Elixer for many years and have always been happy with the product, but the order I just received was different.  The elixer was very sticky and the tube cracked, not once but twice, causing the elixer to squirt all over my bathroom.  I used very little of it and finally threw it out.
B001EPIKB6|5|I love this hair, I always get compliments!
B00A3I37T0|5|I went to Homedepot bought the Universal replacement hose, it did not fit and returned it. Lucky that I found this one on amazon, It fitted Perfectly to my original....Thank You
B001B1MZ5U|5|I love this soothing moisturizer for my skin.
B00756HQNQ|5|Just make sure you only do a little in each dry, rough spot. Don't go hog wild. I made sure to do this and had no problem with soreness from taking too much skin off at one time.<br />Here's a helping hint to soft feet. After you do the microplaning, just before you are going to bed at night, put on a really good overnight foot creme. Then put on socks, that way it doesn't get on your sheets before it has time to sink in. By using the microplane and the overnight foot creme you'll wake up with really nice soft feet.
B0000Y3CBK|3|I have tried different cleansers and while this is not my favorite it is still good. At first I didn't like it and then I realized I was using it wrong -- not applying to dry skin. Once I got it right it did a fine job of removing makeup and and rejuvenating the skin. It is soap-free and gentle but I prefer a gel cleanser that can be used with water like Murad's Anti-redness cleanser, which is also gentle enough to remove eye makeup with very little rubbing. It doesn't have a luxurious feel at all, which I like. It's fine but for the price I wasn't overly impressed.
B008XA0KYA|5|Grerat product.  Love the appicator tip.
B004V0SZNO|4|The two attachments for face are really good, the one for nails is ok, the one for your foot is completely useless!
B000I8VZCG|5|can always depend on this product. its really hard to find in the stores..use this product for everything. works great on sunburns to .Had to come on line to find it.and I always trust amazon. have never had any trouble there always fast on delevery.
B00JBCKQXO|5|I love this product!  I even purchased some fir my mom. She loves them! She hasn't skipped a beat taking her vitamins since.
B000GCJM06|5|Very nice.<br />It keeps my body moisturized after shower and very good to use in winter.<br />Thank you so much!
B004K0CBHQ|5|It's been years since I've put polish on my nails and I've only ever been to the nail salon once, for my wedding.  For a nail novice like me, I had no problems using this USpicy UV Gel Lamp Dryer.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY<br /><br />Assembly involved placing the lightbulbs into the proper slots.  That's it.<br /><br />OPERATION<br /><br />Instructions were poorly translated to English, but it's intuitive and not really necessary.  There are two timer settings (2 minutes and 3 minutes), an always on mode, and off.<br /><br />I like the timer settings.  It means I don't ever have to look at a clock.  Just put my hands in and wait for the light to turn off.<br /><br />APPLYING GEL NAILS<br /><br />This UV lamp is for curing gel nail products.  Before you use it, you'll need to buy some supplies.  I bought the [[ASIN:B0057JCYYE Gelish Basix Kit]] (which comes with everything but the polish) and Gelish nail polish.  If you are worried about the effect of UV light, there are also [[ASIN:B006L6WNVG anti-UV gloves]].<br /><br />I didn't watch any You Tube videos nor read up much on instructions, but here's what I did and it gave my nails a nice finish:<br /><br />1) Shape and buff the nails.<br /><br />2) Apply the pH bond.<br /><br />3) Apply the foundation.  Set in UV dryer for 2 minutes.<br /><br />4) Apply the polish, then set in UV dryer for 2 minutes.  Repeat twice.<br /><br />5) Apply top coat, then set in UV dryer for 3 minutes.<br /><br />6) Wipe nails with cleanser.<br /><br />7) Apply cuticle oil.<br /><br />It was surprisingly easy to do, considering the number of websites devoted to teaching the process.  The only thing I need to improve upon is applying an even layer of nail polish with my right hand.  I'm not very good with my right hand, but I suspect most women have had enough practice doing this that it would not be a problem with either hand.<br /><br />SOME OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSION<br /><br />The dryer is larger than I expected, but that means I can dry all the fingers of one hand or all the toes on one foot at once.  It does get warm in there, but not uncomfortably hot.<br /><br />This UV gel nail dryer works exactly as advertised.  It's easy to use.

B00B2NIARO|1|Very painful and no results. Used 9 times. Destroyed my gums. Waste of money. Too strong.
B0071Q5PL0|5|I do not often write reviews, but this product is every bit as good as it claims to be.  I am post-menopausal and was having a severe problem with dryness and pain.  I'm happy to say that this cream has worked wonders.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0002PU86O|3|Too much of a pain to heat this on the stove in the little metal pan. Then the wax is either too hot to apply or it hardens too fast and doesn't serve the intended purpose. I'd liken the product to hot bubble gum at an upcharge. Let's face it, waxing is best left to the pros.
B003983I1S|5|This was a great razor that did not leave a burn at all. I have used the same blades for over a three weeks and they dulled yet. The best part is the single razor on the back that allows for detailed trimming around the ears and nose. I got these razors free through a program with Gillette
B004L938VY|5|I needed a lotion to use after shower in the gym after my 8 mile morning run. I went looking in stores and then research on Amazon. So, I took a chance and purchased two I was not disappointed. Fragrance is like Cool Water for men. So guys look no further. This is a 2 for one. It is a lotion as well as a colonge. End of story. I hope they have more fragrance especially citrus based.
B003BVINRC|4|We have been using the Hydro 5 blades since they came out and I should rate them much higher than Gilette Mach or knockoff razors.  I shave my face and head daily and rarely experience any nicks or cuts.  These provide a smooth shave with an excellent flow.  They do particularly well on my coarse stubble.  These also tend to last longer than most other brands.  I get about seven shaves per blade.
B000C1VZHO|4|I didn't realize this would come in the red plastic case (not as pictured) I can't stand the packaging but this is my favorite scent of all time.  I just decanted the perfume into another bottle. Love!
B000MJ79R6|5|It is hard to find a tear free paraben free children's shampoo that is not crazy expensive.  THhs one is it!  The added bonus is it smells great too!
B009PZGYJM|5|Amazing quality for the price. Looks exactly as the picture. Very soft, somewhere in between thick and thin. If you want thick extensions, buy two. Completely worth it.
B0075J4TDI|5|Love it.. this is really a good Nivea product and for the price seems unbelievable.  Lathers and scrubs really well and feel like we really used a exfoliater after the shower. I do it once a week and it helps remove any dead skin
B000LNG23A|5|I love Radox!  I wish it was sold in the US, but since it is not, I have to order from the UK.  I was very excited to see that I could now order it from Amazon and I placed an order for 32 bottles - 16 of the Radox Muscle Soak and 16 of the Radox Original.  I received my order in record time, well before the estimated date and only 1 bottle had emptied itself.  I am so happy to finally have some Radox again!  The aroma is so relaxing, there are plenty of long lasting bubbles and it makes me feel \\"at home\\".  You just cannot find bubble bath like this in the US.  Thanks Amazon and OneClick-Pharmacy!! <3
B004S0ETHI|4|Smells so good while you are taking a shower. Once you rinse off, you will not smell like cake!
B008PEXV3Q|5|Very pretty pearls with flat backs and different sizes. They have static to them which makes them a little hard to grab but it's okay :) I love how feminine these look. They make beautiful designs. The price is wonderful, I highly recommend!
B00AH4THVM|5|I love that I can order a 10 pack of this glue for suck a great price. I bought this 10 pack almost a year ago and just ran out. I will only buy this glue because of the quality and the price
B001BOKRIE|4|This hair dryer is lightweight and has a nice temperature for the cool setting. I mostly use this setting and my hair seems to be less dried out as a result. I have never used the high heat setting so I don't know what that is like. Have had good results with leave-in-conditioner on either medium or cool settings. My main hair issue is dried out unmanageable frizzy hair after blow drying which is why I bought this dryer. So far I am very satisfied with it.
B00FEASAFI|5|It curls my lashes nicely!
B00466NKBK|5|I like the non-greasy feel. it keeps my very sensitive eye area well hydrated. i like all the dermatologic products I've ever bought.
B006J5V6ZI|4|This brush is worth every cent.  I really like it.  I use it to apply my bb cream and it leaves such a smooth finish.  I difinitely recommend you add this to your makeup collection.  You will not be disappointed.
B000F5AG5E|3|I've had this model almost two years, and it still gets used everyday with no mechanical issues. I'm giving it only 3 stars because a couple of design flaws, which seemed pretty minor initially, have made it very aggravating over time.<br /><br />First, the on/off and temperature buttons are located in a terrible place on the handle. If you have hair length that requires more than one twist, you will likely turn this iron off accidentally at least once during your styling session. It's also easy to inadvertently hit the button that changes the temperature setting, resulting in a much hotter iron than intended. Second, the cool tip is too small: I burned myself several times before moving to a more one-handed approach.<br /><br />I haven't abandoned this curling iron yet, though, because I like a couple of key features: rapid heating, smooth-surface barrel, temperature. On the hottest setting this curler will almost function like a flat iron if you pull it quickly through small sections, and that has been a lifesaver when I've forgotten to pack all my styling tools on a trip! I definitely don't recommend using that highest temperature on a daily basis (and don't even think about using it on damp hair!), but it's great when you need it. Nice long cord that rotates at the base is a bonus, as is the silicone barrel-cover that permits me to pack it up while it's still warm.<br /><br />Come on, Conair! Fix the small design issues with this curling iron and it would be 5 stars for me!
B0006V5M74|4|I use it once a week. Keeps my feet soft and smooth. The stone is decomposing a little but not too much at all. I bought it nine months ago and it is 90% there. I just keep it out of the shower and in the medicine cabinet when I'm not using it. Would buy again.
B001JQLNNW|4|I use a lot of Olay, so devcided to try thiskit. I was satisfied with it and will probably use it again when it comes on sale.
B007FVT012|4|It was beautiful and a good price, really, but the size of the mirror was small.  I just thought it would be a little bigger.
B008HODSNW|4|I usually get my hair extensions from Sally's which are kinda pricey if you ask me. But when I saw these, I was kinda crazy about them just because of the price. I did look at the reviews and I gotta tell you, these extensions aren't that bad. Yes, their thin, but I'm wearing them now and I'm satisfied. I am being completely honest, I have fine/thin hair, and this works wonders. These are good for pick-a-boos or if you just need a little extra hair to play with (that's why I got them). And I will agree with any of the reviews that say anything about thick hair, yeah, these are too thin. Probably way too thin. I mean with the 7 pieces over lapping each other, there will be more volume, but you would probably need 4 of these combined. Better off getting hair extensions with more g's... No joke, I wouldn't mind going back to this seller, but I also will (like always) look for other sellers too who will have something similar with better quality. Other than that, shipment came on time and it put a smile on my face when I tried them on, so I think this product deserves a good four stars.
B004NGZKKM|5|These little things are awesome.  They are individually wrapped. You can get food out of your teeth with one end, brush and polish with the other end.  It has a minty bead of toothpaste type stuff in it that is sooo FRESH.  Keep them in your desk at work, in your night table, purse and car, for really clean frshness on the go.  Good for camping too, I would imagine.
B001FAVJBI|5|Okay, so I admit it - I am a female, so I really don't know if guys will like this scent on them, but I love it! It smells like clean skin and perfumed soap.  The fact that it has a somewhat strong scent doesn't bother me because you can always use less.  Not bad for the low price of $3.17 at our local WalMart.  The only downside is that the cologne comes out fast, so you have to figure out a way to tip  out the cologne gently.  This is a no pretense type cologne that comes in a plastic bottle.  It might bother those with sensitive skin. I find that it warms the skin slightly on initial contact.  My advice - try it, but use it sparingly.
B001TK4LM8|5|So I ordered 4 of these, I got 2 in dark brown and 2 in milk and I love them! They even arrived ahead of schedule which was nice. the only problem was that one of the milk colored pencils didn't have a cap so the pencil kind of got smeared on the inside of the box. Soooo the pencils were poorly packaged but the product works really well and I don't see myself using any other pencil :)
B00387F7EQ|5|Love these floss sticks!!!!  I am extremely disappointed that Johnson & Johnson is discontinuing this product. They are replacing it with a product that is only offered in 'mint' flavor and I must have the unflavored product.
B002MZ8BK2|5|works beautifully! the green stopper pops out sometimes but crazy glue can take care of that! mine wasnt the knock-off other people were talking about! its really easy to use, just add your color of polish on your design, scrap off extra with scraper, stamp design with stamper then roll onto your nail...BAM you got some cute nails for that hot date or work or for the heck of it! hahaha this stamper doesnt come with designs so dont forget to get those too!
B006W2SYHG|4|I like it, takes some getting used to if you're used to the older Norelco designs/shape.  Cuts well, close.  Hold charge well, performs as expected.  Couple notes: The carry case is bigger and takes up more space and the trimmer is smaller and more awkward to use than the older series/models
B0009XH6V4|5|I'm blown away (literally). This is the best hair dryer I've ever owned. Compact, powerful, super light-weight, dual voltage...for under $15...are you kidding me?! Flicked the voltage switch using a coin, and it worked great when we were in Italy. Andis Micro Hair Dryers rule!
B002XPVHZ2|5|Excellent leave-in coditioner
B000P20U7G|1|HE EAU DE PARFUM DOES NOT GOT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE BRAND.<br />I WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND UPON RETURN OR INSTRUCTIONS FOR IT.
B00UOBCMG0|5|Not cheap, serves its purpose and the brush is sturdy.<br />All in all, I am happy with my purchase!
B001BAN0FK|3|It came exactly when it was supposed to but when i got it there were some dents in it but it still works great
B0016SJLD2|5|We use various forms of silver a lot for germ killing and healing. When liquid forms caused intense pain to use on serious scrapes, this gel did the job without the pain. It is a permanent part of our first aid kit.
B0020MMCJI|4|has a good smell
B002HK2GI0|5|This is exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find anywhere else.  It does the job perfectly and leaves my eyelashes looking great, no clumps of mascara.  I agree with other reviews that it's sharp, so use it carefully. It folds up neatly, no sharp edges are left exposed.  This is a great product!  I may order another just to have in reserve.
B007N58Y5I|5|fast ship and was perfect for the beach great size and waterproof...
B00BH0VQJQ|1|All lies this was terrible throw it away..
B0006IHDR4|5|i finally got my perfume. i love it, it's in good conditions and at a good price..
B000AADG42|1|The product that I ordered was not the product that I have gotten in the past from beauty supply stores. This product was supposed to be gel, but this was a strong chemical scented liquid. Weather could not have been a factor since the product was never in extreme heat while in transit. This was my first bad experience I have ever encountered with online purchases. If you are thinking about ordering this particular product...DON'T!
B00EQ4XOYK|5|Has met all expectations.
B001R4CLEQ|4|Its refreshing and comprised of natural ingredients. However, I did not notice any amazing changes to my skin or face. BUT I did not break out or have any adverse reactions. So in theory obtaining the same results from a heavy-chemical FREE toner is definitely beneficial as opposed to rubbing lots of inorganic substances into your face. However, this stuff is not the cheapest.
B003V9L37Q|5|I love this perfume so much. My friend smeled it on me she really loved it and I bought one for her birthday ,she really loves it.
B000M25QPK|5|I've been using tretinion for about a year now progressing from 0.025% to 0.05% concentration. Since I started, there is really a dramatic continual change in my skin. I usually have a lot of breakouts but I have to say that tretinion combined with other products from the obagi system really conditioned my skin, cleared it out, and continually made it looking smooth and radiant. Great product!
B001JJBC9Y|5|Very solidly built. With other clippers I always was annoyed how I would have stray long hairs after buzzing. With this one everything is uniform in length. I've got thick hair and this cut like a gem. I would recommend buying the add on attachments if you want more variety in lengths.
B002CMLJU4|3|The seller needs to learn to package things better! You do not wrap liquids in tissue paper  and use padded envelopes even if they are sealed in plastic! Bubble wrap and a cardboard box would have cost a wee bit more and maybe taken a little longer prep time , but well worth it these days, I think when most of us can't afford to lose a good customer! As my late father always said,&#34;Do it right the first time!&#34;
B000SWXZMU|1|This is extremely drying, I put chapstick over it, which made it come off. I used it without anything over it and my lips look shriveled. I wanted stain so that I could kiss my baby. I don't see the purpose of this if it comes off when you drink water or lick your lips. Get lipsense by senegence if you really want a waterproof and kiss proof stain.
B0009H5W3E|5|Been using GENA for years and, for professional use, it's a great bang for the buck. I recommend getting one of those screw-on spouts for it; it will facilitate transferring the jug's contents into smaller dispensers.
B0080L9G9C|4|I looked in to alternatives to colgate and crest because the regular toothpastes were causing my teeth to be really heat/cold sensitive. Since I started using Earth Paste my teeth have not once experienced pain from heat or cold. I also haven't gotten any more cavities.  The mouth-feel of this is very nice, it makes your teeth feel spotlessly clean to the point where you can't go back. The taste is also just fine, it's minty and sweet, but not nearly as sweet as the commercial toothpastes. Minus one star for the price; they seem to charge a lot for a tube of dirt.
B00FQ5517Q|4|Product shipped out faster than expected. It's just something cute to wear.
B00BT058CK|5|I do not have an \\"Educated Nose\\" to be able to name the notes - I only know what I like!  I have yet to find a Shiseido fragrance that I dislike.  And, I love Shiseido Sun Ltd Ed. for 2013.  It is a light scent that I would describe as Floral/Fruity.  It will be one of my main Go To Scents for Summer.  I can't wait to try Shiseido Sun Ltd. Ed. For 2014!
B004VMGTY4|5|good
B002HWS4R0|5|A great alternative to a razor that works well when you need a quick shave. This is the first electric shaver I've owned in years, and I'm impressed with its performance.
B0017K8HJS|5|This product works very well. I have a very short hair cut...and If I can't get to the beauty parlor every week, I can slick this on my edges and they won't stick out.<br /><br />I put it on at night and put my scarf on. When I wake, I take my scarf off and go.<br /><br />I have been using it for about two months and I still have a lot left...so, you only have to use a little bit in order to get the desired effect.<br /><br />I don't know if the price is good because I have never seen this brand in the beauty parlor, but it does work well.<br /><br />It has a bit of a floral scent...which I don't care for...but you don't even smell it after you use it consistently.<br /><br />I thin it is well worth the price.
B004U9XI9W|5|These were a big hit with a few of my first grade boys who I was looking for a reward for. Won them over right away!
B0000531IJ|5|Just for me!
B00C84VPDW|5|Very good !
B00009RF1E|5|My old trimmer of about 2 years was on it's last legs. It was becoming rusted after an episode where it was exposed to water on the back of the sink and the inside gearbox was going. I bought this because where I live all the local stores carry such a small selection of personal beard trimmers. I didn't want to pay a fortune for one of the lithium ion rechargeable kind, so I elected for this instead. I'm very happy with the purchase. The battery life is exceptional for being such a small trimmer. It's pretty powerful, but not overbearing like my other one was with the noise they produce. The stand isn't worth a D*&$ but none of these are. If you're looking for one that will sit and charge in the stand than keep looking, as most of the cheaper ones you simply plug in, and then sit in the base while it's charging. It's kind of an illusion and should be false advertising if you ask me, but I was well aware of this from my old unit and therefore wasn't surprised. I've had it for a while and it's still going strong, so it still receives my seal of approval.
B00TXFVRUU|5|The best soap ever ! My brother suffer from severe skin allergies and this is the only soap he can use without any issues .
B003JN690U|2|These tool really did not help me apply my lashes.  Maybe I do not know how to use it but I just was not getting it to work.
B0067VFWIQ|5|I got these all the way from Hong Kong and they didn't take forever to get. Other people even like them so much they have claimed them for their own paper crafts or nail art!
B00FF1N844|5|Wonderful, lightweight moisturizer.
B000N2IGWY|5|Nice for fine layered hair if you can figure out exactly how much or little works for you and it is somewhat rework able<br />If you dampen your hands for a perk up.
B000IO8JYM|1|I'm 30 (ish) fair skinned woman, who's always had acne prone skin. I'd only ever once found an inexpensive and worthy product that worked, then Bath & Body Works decided to discontinue it (figures) about 10 years ago. Since, I've hunted for the next best thing, spending a small fortune in vain to simply clear up my face. It's just on the chin and forehead, but still there no matter what I use (including proactiv). So I thought I'd try this line of products. Once again, I've been left disappointed as although this product softens the skin and pores it didn't do anything about the acne.
B00B7RM6MU|4|You get what you pay for. If I wanted to spend $120 to $220 on a razor, I could have gotten a better looking razor. However, the blade holds an excellent edge, and if you buy it from Wet Shaving Products - comes shave ready. This is an excellent straight razor for beginners or for those who are a little more frugal
B00024Y05K|5|This is by far the best lip gloss out there. It costs about $25 dollars so be prepared to pay for quality. My favorite color is Eclipse, which looks very scary deep red with gold flecks in the package but is nowhere near this color when you put it on. It's actually a sheer berry color that looks beautiful on every skin color and doesn't feel like glue on your lips. It also doesn't look greasy, just pretty. And, believe it or not, for some reason the color actually seems to make your teeth look whiter! So I highly recommend this lip gloss but call your store in advance if you want the Eclipse color because it is ALWAYS sold out.
B00H56KCUU|1|Where is the pore erasing qualities to this? I have big pores in some parts of my face ( around my cheeks near my nose) and it didn't do anything! I tried it on other areas of my face where my pores are barely visible to see any difference. None! I have never used a primer with silicone so i'm guessing that's why i'm having such a hard time dealing with this slick sorta oily feel ( its not oily...just weird ). I have used the e.l.f. Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer in tone adjusting green and since i ran out i wanted to another drug store primer. I read comments of people saying it was more for dry skin and not oily, but in my case i have pretty oily skin, and i didn't see an increase. Just remember a little goes a long way with primers and they have to be applied in a &#34;patting motion&#34; gently into your skin. I wouldn't recommend this primer for anyone. Its just a slather or silicone on your face. Big pores or not there are other primers that actually do something!
B001A42R1A|5|Great product for sleep apnea dental appliance users.  Using the dental appliance has a tendency  to keep your mouth open, thus drying the mouth out.  The tabs help alleviate most of the dry mouth problems I have experienced
B00CGASZW2|5|je suis très satisfait du produit.
B00H2QJ1Z0|5|Really nice brushes, soft just like my IT Cosmetics Bukhi brushes!!! at an affordable price. I can't wait to use them ALL...:) &#60;3...<br /> I will buy again, and I will be going to the website to see what other products they have,,,,my new favorite is SHANY products!!!
B0048ZGEJY|5|always love this product. used for years.  Glad to find it on Amazon.
B000G82IRY|5|I love this scent, and the pricing is very affordable. It smells feminine- warm, floral, sweet and fruity; but somehow  its not at all cloying. It reminds me of chocolate and raspberries. People always stop and ask me what I'm wearing when I'm wearing Mignonette.
B003BMGAUI|5|I have not been able to find this product in any local store. So happy to find it on amazon and at such a good price. My daughter is in the skincare business and she highly recommends, it's like a mini peel and works wonders on brown spots.
B000X2DMEG|1|I have purchased this item in the past.  The gel should be clear with a shade of gold.  I recently ordered three jars.  All had turned opaque with an &#34;off&#34; scent.  I returned them and reordered and received the product in the same opaque condition.  My wife went to a local beauty supply store.  The same products were clear and fragrant.  The clerk offered that what I had received was spoiled product.  That is the last time that I will ever order this product through  Amazon until quality control can be guaranteed.  It is no fun repackaging and returning these products.  No convenience, there!
B003DQ8LVS|5|My wife ordered this one all I can say was it's not my color LOL !
B001AJ6YS2|3|I needed a very quiet shaver for my husband.  He was bed bound and felt the noise level would bother others in the room.  I returned it and the credit was immediate.
B001E8F228|5|It is very hard to find deodorant WITHOUT anti-perspirants which are loaded with aluminum. Very happy with this product.
B00GTWCBAA|3|very cute, but found original price tag still on bag for much cheaper! :(
B0043MM3ZG|5|I love it!!!! The BEST lotion around! The smell is very rich and enticing! Brown Sugar is Superb! Buy this product !
B00IKULFJC|5|I mistakenly purchased this for the Bare Escentuals brand, which I do use, but I am very satisfied with Pure Minerals and would purchase again. The price was very competitive.
B003MAE3V2|5|Thank you! My favorite toothpaste.
B005YXU3R8|3|I've tried a number of brands of Xylitol mints and gum (Spry, Xyla, Ricochet, etc.), so I thought I'd give these a try, too. Overall, the taste of them is not bad, but doesn't taste at all like \\"fresh fruit.\\" Instead, it tastes like bubble gum. I'd be fine with this product being labelled \\"bubble gum\\" flavor, but can't rate it highly when it doesn't taste at all like fresh fruit.
B00BB8JXFS|5|Love this. Been using it for years. Wouldn't use anything else.
B007BETSM4|4|The product is very effective. I used it at night and all the acne look much better. But not sure about long-term effect - I received it yesterday and only used once.<br />The reason I don't give it five stars is that it was gross when I unpacked it. There was some unknown mucus-like liquid outside the small paper box of this tube. I guess it got stained by something else before packing. Although I like the product itself, the unpacking experience was really unpleasant.
B000BIZSYO|5|Great quality & fast delivery! We are very happy with this product!
B000KE5OBG|5|I bought this for my daughter.  I have no idea if it is like the mood ring.  I watched her apply the blue (told her, her lips were turning blue like that brat on Willie Wonka).  But seriously, I noticed that her lips initially turned pink then turned into a darker pink the longer it was on.  I am pleased with this.  It was not too bright, too dark, and very far from being trashy.  It is subtle and appropriate.
B00OXERE44|1|It's starting to wear out after about 2weeks
B0067F8BBM|5|SO many to pick and choose from. Such a great purchase for such little price. Loved it.
B001MA0QY2|5|Excellent product.  Was a little hesitant due to the price because EVERYONE knows if you want a quality flat iron, you have to pay $100+ for it right?  (At least that was my understanding living in a house full of females...)  Anyway, I read the positive reviews and decided to get it for my wife since hers broke.  It came in and she has used it for several weeks.  I asked her one day how she liked it and she replied, &#34;I love it.&#34;<br /><br />Well there you go.  Straight from a woman's mouth... :)
B00028QF2M|4|Good
B004WSXD4G|1|This is the first time I tried this product and i bought 2 of them. I'm almost done using the first 2 bottles, been using it day and night but still haven't seen any changes. I might just try other product.
B0002L93N2|3|This curling is great, but bear in mind its just for really giving body to your hair not real curl. Also, it's very easy to burn yourself due to it large size.
B003JN50Q4|4|I love the the soft texture it gives my hair. It helps my hair to grow also!
B000GLRREU|3|I have used it only for about a week now, and I sense that it doesn't have the strongest motor. I would recommend another model, folks.
B009WI4YYO|5|This color met my expectations. Its a thin glossy glitter polish, not very opaque.  I love it. Will buy more.
B0087QFTOG|5|My mom had a mirror like this when I was a child.  I found out recently that it broke, so I found this for her.  She really likes it.  They aren't easy to find!
B001FWXT7I|1|Braces aren't triangular, so why do the big corporations cut a V-shaped channel trimmed down the middle of the brush and say it fits well around rectangular braces? I guess it's easier to manufacture that way, but after buying this one, I've seen other designs that clean easier and under braces and the arch wires, like the Easy Braces brush!
B007JT7AIK|5|I have worked this shampoo into my routine.  I use about 3 or 4 shampoos and conditioners throughout the week and I shampoo and condition everyday.  This is one I have thrown into the mix.  It has helps keep my scalp clean and healthy.  My kids and husband like it as well. The bottle is a nice shape and can be turned over so you can get all of the product out.  It also has a easy open cap, just press down on one side and the other side pops open.  The consistency of the shampoo is medium to slightly thick and it smells quite nice but not over whelming.  I just think that taking a shower and all of that should be a pleasure everyday and not such a chore.
B005PCAWZ6|5|My Mom really, really likes this fragrance.  It was a birthday gift, and was perfect for her and she smells great.
B00JX979CQ|5|Hubby has been using the InstaNatural 100% Pure Emu oil after shaving for a few weeks now and LOVES IT!  And I can honestly say that I do, too!  He has very sensitive skin and after shaving would be red, dry and generally uncomfortable.  Now with the Emu Oil from InstaNatural, his skin is healthy and feels great, too!  I love that InstaNatural uses pure oil, so I do not have to worry about any toxins getting into his skin via any cuts or scrapes.  He has also noticed that some of his acne scars on his face are starting to fade and he attributes that to the Emu Oil!
B009R3JEBM|5|ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time! I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!
B00BQ76XK2|1|These were extremely small and disappointing. The only reason they deserve one star is because it came 2 weeks earlier than it was supposed to.
B005Z1W4SK|3|I gave this as a gift to other Evanovich fans (Bvlgari is what Ranger uses) and their response was measured but positive.  I had hoped for a more memorable and stronger fragrance although it is pleasant and fresh.  I thought it was a little expensive for a fictional Ranger 2-bath experience.
B004UBB2NO|4|Not the most solid machine but for the price works well. Im not sure how long it will last but quite happy with it so far. According to all the reviews I have read it lasts at least a year so is worth it to me. Ive had other ones only last a month or two. So a year or longer would be awesome
B001H270RQ|5|The top coat is very shiny and dries very fast. I would recommend all of the Essie products and will buy more myself.
B004DBVQ4G|5|I have extremely thick and curly hair. Before I started using this shampoo and conditioner I wasn't able to control my hair! It was really frizzy and seemed like it did things on it's own.<br /><br />I only use the shampoo 2-3 times a week to let my natural oils help moisturize, and I use the Suave Conditioner daily. I've already noticed a tremendous change in my hair, it's softer, hydrated and my curls are looking a lot healthier! I even started to get more compliments on my hair! Plus I feel the price is really cheap, considering you get 75.6 oz of shampoo (6 x 12.6) for a low price.<br /><br />Buy the conditioner as well!
B004CCP93A|5|Best bang for your buck, for sure. Scent is nice, smells kind of &#34;old-fashioned.&#34;<br /><br />In terms of hold-strength, it's certainly up to pair with many of those other &#34;extreme-hold&#34; gels, AND t doesn't end up flaking up like the other gels do. (I haven't tried it while doing any intense physical activity, however.)<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this product to those who need a strong-holding gel, and the price is fantastic.
B0012XAQZI|5|Really makes a difference. The color is even better than when I had it done in the first place! Be careful to distribute it evenly though because one time I had definitely more color at the roots of my hair and not the lenght.
B004CS578Q|2|Have not used enough of it yet to tell if it works as promised  I did not use this or review it.
B0055O64VU|5|I bought a box of these same strips from my dentist and paid $75! I wore them while I slept and after a couple of strips, I couldn't believe the improvement of the whiteness of my teeth. I am a heavy coffee drinker and never thought my teeth could get white again, especially after 5 days. The dental hygienist said that they could possibly whiten a little more with another box of strips. They were out of the strips, so I checked Amazon and couldn't believe they were only $25, so I ordered a box. The hygienist, also said that if I treat my teeth one night a month, it should keep my teeth white. She told me that is what she does.
B00J4EZHLU|5|Love this product.. Great for thinning lashes
B00FULYKG4|5|My buddies told me about the mangroomer product so I went to buy it from amazon and noticed they just release this new version of their back shaver.  I decided to go with the ultimate version - (only 10 bucks more).  Received it in the mail 2 days, (cool packaging) charged it up overnight and tried it out.<br /><br />The unit is super solid and is easy to control.  I started out with the trimmer attachment because I have not shaved my back in about 1 year - so i have some pretty decent growth.  I opened it up fully as the instructions stated to get the best angle and turned it on.  I started shaving on my upper shoulder blades/upper back and moved over the area a few times.  No pulling or pain, no irration.  They also have this turbo button that kicks the shaver into hi-gear for super hairy patches.  After cleaning up my upper back, I extended the handle about half way and locked it into to place with their red locking button and continued to work my way down and around my back.  I then fully extended the handle to reach a patch of hair in my lower back (you now that spot when you have an itch and can't reach :).  Wow and my back was looking great!!!  I then switched out the attachments to the body grooming one - it gets a much closer shaver - really close and smooth. So far, I am a big fan this product - really awesome and I receommend to any dude who hates their back and wants it removed effortlessly.
B003U8ESI4|5|Great product.
B00MW3TND8|5|Works good. Good conditioner.
B002JPJ2ZS|3|I am 22 years old and I am under a lot of stress at work in the shipyard. I took this pill for 60 days and it kind of slowed down the hair loss process for awhile.
B001OIF1F6|5|This is such a brilliant beatiful shade of red that I think would look great on anyone, regardless of skin tone. I feel comfortable and professional wearing this to work, as it is not over the the top, but still makes your nails look great, Really, with anything OPI, you can' go wrong.
B00C84ZX1W|5|Just as expected
B001AJIBBU|5|I have been using this for several years and it is a superior product to any other I have tried!
B0052D4416|5|It is a beautiful color! :) I'm a light tan skin tone and the shade looks devine. It last on me for nearly half a day
B00HTJKJ2O|2|Poor quality! The first two broke immediately when trying to use them.
B00EZM9ESS|3|Ok. The &#34;neon&#34; colors aren't as bright and vibrant as suggested in the pictures. That being said, I do like the gems in the set, I just wish they had that bright, eye-catching look that's advertised. The item arrived WAY before estimated, which was great. The approximate delivery was February 28-March 5th, and I received the item on February 9th. That was awesome. I order tons of gems and rhinestones from China because I like to &#34;bedazzle&#34; things and I'm considering opening an etsy shop with all of the awesome things I make. I have a gel nail polish kit at home (the kind that includes an LED light to cure the polish, etc) and I place the gems with a regular top coat to whatever it is I'm decorating, then apply a clear gel top coat and cure the item under the light, and voila! Beautiful things that I get constant compliments on. I realize I'm going off on a tangent here.... Anywho, I've attached a picture of the advertised item next to what I actually received. You'll definitely notice the difference. Even with my somewhat dissatisfaction with this, I'm going to continue to order gems and whatnot from China because you really, really can't beat the prices, so I'm willing to take the risk. I hope this review has been helpful.
B0016BLWEU|5|Been using this for 3 or 4 years now. Nothing else compares... I get compliments on the fragrance all the time, but mostly I just love how it feels. I now have it on automatic reorder!
B001T8QJM0|5|I have fairly thick, mostly straight hair. These are my favorite hair ties, but they wear out after a few weeks.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Inexpensive. A dollar a dozen, hard to beat that!<br /> - No metal parts to tug on your hair<br /> - Good color for dark hair<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - After a few uses the hair tie starts to stretch to the point of having little elasticity<br /><br />I wear my hair in a pony tail or bun nearly every day, and I like my hair pulled back tight. I try to wrap the tie around my ponytail at least 4 times, and my ponytail is almost 2 inches in diameter. So I usually alternate between four different ties over a month or so. Giving a break between uses seems to extend their lives.
B00LKSXA6W|5|Primo quality. Good product!
B00P27VLKY|5|this product is awesome. Whenever i run out im going to buy it again.
B00JAOUJ4E|5|I brought three bars of this soap, thinking it wasn't go to work for me.  I was wrong this is the best soap I have ever used for my skin.  My skin became dry and itchy and I tried many soaps for relief and since I started using coconut oil soap I am not having any problems with my skin.  I made sure this was right for my skin.  Only draw back it doesn't smell like coconut.
B00005MA7O|5|I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it.  Very easy to use, heats up fast, and she really likes the changable plates for different styles.  For the price, this is a great product.  As with any heat product on your hair, be careful not to burn your hair by leaving it in one spot for too long.  Highly recommend!
B004JZNKH2|4|There are 3 seperate surfaces on this brush, so you can use it for different purposes.  Well made and convenient.
B0089GBCEK|5|this is an awesome little kit I have been using it non stop on my manicures and pedicures. Thanks a bunch!
B00CQ66BRC|2|Too much hair. The look on line does not match what I received. I will keep the item but will not purchase another at this time.
B001BSTGX2|3|I can't use them anyway.  The machine has quit working in my apartment plugs.
B0009OAGRO|5|MADE HER HAPPY THATS ALL THAT MATTERS
B004BD9152|5|I love this toner i have purchased it before from Amazon I love that it is alcohol free since i do have sensative skiface feels<br />silky ater use great buy
B00FRDPPKK|5|Best stuff ever for fine colored hair
B008L2VP62|5|Great product!!!  I will try to find more of it.  There arent any products like this around.  Great value for the price
B00JITDVM8|5|No friction is not a good package, but it is a good shaver
B00J7A4SAW|5|wonderful and packages so nice will buy again
B000W9SMGS|5|I am a make up artist and bought these for myself. The brushes are super silky & cover great! The sable is THE BEST you can buy for this kind of price! Love them!!
B007UTLF4Y|3|I ordered this for my daughter, and so far she has no comments about the product.. so go for it.
B00847X67K|5|Would not have short hair without this product!
B001B4QY8G|5|Excellent product. Our local organic store stopped selling it.  It is more money wise to buy it in larger quantities.  Excellent for aromatherapy.  Best after a good hot bath.
B001ECQ56Q|2|Over all the product smelled nice, and worked well, but it made me develop a nice red rash under my arm pit.  If you have sensitive skin, beware.  This product is not for you.
B00DA54ED6|5|I was supposed to receive two different colors and didn't so that was upsetting. Besides that they were pretty costume jewelry!!
B00JYJH2TK|5|pretty and inexpensive summer necklace
B000MREG74|5|$35.00 cheaper than buying in at my salon!  Works excellant.  My daughter and I both use it.  I highly like this product to any one looking to grow longer lashes!
B00E4PMQAO|5|Finally I've found the product to clean me up!  I'm 62 years/female and this last year have been having too much nose hair growth. I've been plucking with tweezers which takes awhile in addition to sneezing & hurting - and missing some hairs.  I'm so happy with this tool; it does a great job, is painless, and best of all it's quick!  It's pretty quiet, easy to position for hair removal, and so far I couldn't be happier. It's not made for this, but I also used it to clean up random hairs below my eyebrows (NOT the eyebrows). My husband will be using it too and I will use it to remove ear hairs and earlobe hairs for him.  I've only had this a couple weeks, but so far I'd highly recommend this product.<br /><br /> .
B00IUYZ4UE|5|Rosehip oil is the new &#34;thing&#34;, kind of like the pet rock only this brand makes your hands feel good.
B00BQMNPJ4|5|AN excellent product with a subtle, pleasant scent. I am usually not a body cream user because of the greasy feel many of the products leave on my skin, but this left no residue. I would definitely buy this product again!
B000K7E2G6|5|it works very good and it is very nice i recomend this item it is awesome!<br />best price for this item
B00GG06NS6|5|This glover works great with my curling iron. While not completely heat proof, I find that as soon as my fingertips feel warm/hot it's a measure of when my hair needs to be released from the iron. The glove fits well, it's stretchy and pulls on and off easily. I've been using or a few months and it's held up well. The seller also included a free gift: 4 rhinestone bobby pins, which I loved.
B001SINQV8|5|The voyager diabetic needle disposal unit is perfect in more than one ways. Not only does it provide a \\"must have\\" convenient option for storage but also provides a secured disposal option that assures the user a safe environment.  It is sized \\"just right\\" because it is not intrusive and does not require a great deal of space for storage, whether at home or on the road.<br /><br />I think it is a \\"must have\\" convenience and safety option.
B00I471M9E|3|I have to go over area several times.  I must not have the angle right.
B00TWPGS14|5|makes my skin feel really smooth - nice
B00KUHAYGI|5|Works great apply a somewhat thick layer to get it to remove easily. Feels like rubber ehen dried and peels off and clears your pores.
B002TSA952|4|Nice product!!
B00B8V2CUQ|1|I returned the balance of the product with no difficulty. Felt gooey in my mouth and was difficult to clean out once the partial was removed. My dentist said this type of product often cause irritation.
B00NVGK7E4|5|Love this product! Just as good as the ones that are more expensive and give you half the amount as this one.
B000P75VW0|1|by the time i got this it was almost all leaked all over the box it didnt even stay on the body im never purchasing this ever again
B000B58J4S|5|I am very pleased with the Jovan musk.  I have been using the cologne for many years; however, I had not been able to find it in a retail store.  I was almost out and decided to try to order through Amazon.  What a nice surprise to find my favorite cologne again!  I am enjoying using it thoroughly.
B007JPPAQ8|3|It's okay. Not a lot of smell to it, but it does smell like vanilla. I haven't noticed any pheromone qualities, but it's a good base for layering scents.
B0084BPHIM|5|Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.
B005OZM810|5|Really nice, does what its supposed to
B000172RMG|1|first they charged $10 for shipping a $6 item. I paid it as I thought the rain hat would be pretty and easy to keep in my purse. Then they sent the wrong color. The item is not at all like what it looks like in the picture. When contacted, they said I would have to pay for return shipping, and they would refund me what the item cost ONLY&#62;
B00CHV3LNS|5|This product is great- easy to use, like a professional nail job but at home on your own time, and saving a few dimes too!
B0050KCY40|1|I am returning the item. Upon delivery the box with the unit was torn and well battered. Upon opening the box I found crusted peach paraffin on the inside of the metal heater unit, unsanitary and obviously used unit, and the knob was bent downward. The paraffin itself was also used and placed in gallon zip lock bag. I am shocked at the blatant disregard for sanitation and product quality.
B00Q0XZZQU|3|I received my chocolate lip scrub in just the right time. I just got home from vacation and my lips were very neglected from being  in the sun and not drinking enough water.  I opened the pack and noticed there weren't any instructions of how to prep prior to using or how often to use.  I wasn't sure if i were to stir prior to applying, so i didn't the first time. It made a mess, but it did get rid of dry skin on my lips. I chose to use every morning. The second day I stired prior to using. This made more of a mess. The oils got on outside of jar and i almost dropped whole containe,but continued to smooth my lips.  It tasted sweet, but not sure I'd say chocolate. Almost a maple syrup smell/taste.  I can't wait to see how this continues to work. I received this at a promotional price in return for my unbiased opinion but I feel like not only is the lip scrub functional, it taste yummy too.
B001AMN194|5|This tool provides important relief to my neck and shoulder due to my injury.
B0058T6UQG|5|perfect for what I wanted them for, thank you!
B0081TQ150|5|I have two young boys and they have always hated getting their haircut because of the itchy feeling from the hair. This has totally solved that problem. It was very easy to install and works well. The hose does kink but it's not a problem if you're paying attention to it. My only complaint would be that storage is more difficult with the hose attached unless you take it apart each time. A shoebox sized plastic container may be the solution for that but I have yet to try it.
B004M8BTQU|5|I was familiar with this aloe concentrate because i used it before, but had some worries cause never bought it from this seller. I got exactly what I expected: good quality product. I'm gonna order more. thank you
B007Y8MA6I|5|I'm not a licensed nail technician but I do acrylic nails on my friends and family. These nail tips make your hands and nails look so beautiful and clean. For those who want your color acrylic to stand out big time these are the best tips to use. I love them and will definitely order more =)
B009JCV8G0|5|great
B000BIZSVC|5|I love this spray. I've tried to use other sprays but always come back to this one.  So happy when I found it on Amazon.
B00HP49992|5|I'm happy with the service and the product
B00HHEBJ66|5|this is a repeat order for me love it
B005KDI284|3|After using half a dozen times for indoor tanning, I don't see a real improvement over the base tan I already had.  Easy to apply and light fragrance that's not too much for male use.
B003UKKH6O|2|The toothbrush came properly packed and in time.  It appeared to be pretty good at the first glance.  The on/off button felt a bit flimsy and mushy to me; however, I didn't want to have any preconceived bias against it.  Our son started using it and it worked fine for the first few days.  Unfortunately, it started to malfunction soon and the switch turned out to be the culprit.  Initially, it would act up by not turning on and sometimes we couldn't turn it off.  The charging system was suspected of malfunction in the beginning, but I think it was okay.  The only incentive to purchase this unit was to save money, but well... you get what you pay for I suppose.  I returned the unit for a refund and purchased a higher-end electric toothbrush for our son from Costco.  I chose Costco instead of Amazon only because we would have much more time for the return of the (defective) unit.  BY the way, my wife and I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes from Costco for almost a year now without any incidence.  I am little nervous to recommend the unit to anyone because of our bad luck (?).  It may be okay to use if it was just that our unit was a lemon.  Please read other reviews (good and bad) before making up your mind.
B00OOMMR1A|1|You get what you pay for. Extremely cheap. The clip came right off the belt as soon as I tried on.
B00821ROSK|5|I love these products.  The oils are thick and moisturizing.  I use the red pimento 1-2 per week and the castor oil before a wash.  My hair feels so soft and my curls are so shiny.  Love this.
B003X9VXAG|1|This product was not good at all.  Now my car has black marks where the eyelashes were flying back and hitting the car, and they all broke off.  DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!!!!!!!!
B004GHAU4O|5|I bought this mineral makeup primarily for its sunscreen capability, since I have never been able to wear liquid sunscreen on my face. The liquid sunscreens vaporize and make my eyes tear to the point where I am incapable of doing anything. Liquid foundations have always been unsatisfactory for me, too. But surprise! This mineral makeup takes fifteen to twenty years off my face's apparent age, makes me look gorgeous, and provides sunscreen too! Wow, just Wow! My skin looks smooth, dewy, flawless, and glowing, and the shade is perfect for me. I have never been able to find a good shade in liquid makeup.  And it's quick and easy to apply. Will I continue to reorder this and use it daily? You guess!
B000WUD83E|5|I bought this soap at an urging of a friend and I could not be happier with it! I have spent tons of money on expensive department store products for my face and this beats all of them! The bottle is huge and will certainly last me a very long time! Will definitely purchase again and continue to recommend to friends and family. My skin literally glows.
B00IDWP4IA|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!  It goes on great & absorbs well.  Since I've started using it, my skin has never looked better!  My brown spots are fading & wrinkles seem to be diminishing!  I use their Vitamin C Toner first & let dry, then apply this Vitamin C Serum (a little goes a long way!), then follow with their Vitamin C Moisturizer in the morning & their Retinol Moisturizer at night to really zap those wrinkles & prevent new ones!  So far it's really helping & will only use these products on my skin!  I've tried many other products from this company & absolutely love all of them (from their hair products to face products).  No other product compares & their prices are really great too compared to similar products out there.  I highly recommend their entire product line & love that's it's all natural.  Your face will love it & you'll definitely see a difference within a few weeks.<br /><br />This product was provided to me for free for testing purposes, and would definitely purchase again!
B0015XUUF6|5|Love this product, great smell that holds in my hair all day. A great addition to my hair care process.
B0020BYZCG|5|My hands feel soooo smooth.  I knit . Since using the cream, my hands don' t snag the yarn anymore.
B00UG449AC|5|I was so excited when I recieved this in the mail. I've already wanted to try a Dead Sea mud mask. When I used the product my face felt much smoother and i felt rejuvenated after using it. The container is large enough where you can get several uses out of it. It would highly recommend it..you will not regret it!
B000O6AQ7W|5|Great for me. I am always going to buy this.
B000LHLIIU|5|This is a good product for us ladies w/ a few extra years. Expensive but works better than Oil of Olay.
B00EV0T56U|3|I love the color, but I can NOT get it to stay on for long periods of time. I even went out and bought the lip primer by OCC and it doesn't work for me. I'm really sad because I've spent over $100 on lip tar and its not living up to its name.
B0099EHM86|5|I gave this product a try after a discussion with my physician about hair loss.  He suggested I switch to a sulfate free shampoo.  I tried several &#34;good&#34; brands, but not one had any effect on the continual hair loss.  Eventually I purchased a bottle of the Tea Tree shampoo (the one with rosemary) from Maple Holistics and wow was there a difference!  I stopped having huge masses of hair in the drain after every shower and the hair that stayed on my head has thickened up noticeably.  I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and it is always the same quality shampoo that I started with.<br />I have been so happy with this product that I even decided to get a different product in the Maple Holistics line for my boyfriend to try.  He suffers from psoriasis and it is a constant battle for him.  I chose the sage shampoo since that seemed to give the best potential to address his condition.  That was about 5 months or so ago.  His psoriasis is absolutely getting better!  Not only is the flaky patches going away, but the irritated redness and itching/burning is just gone.  I know products all work differently for everyone, but if I was looking for a product line that might actually live up to it's hype, this one is worth a try in my opinion.  I did and I couldn't be happier.
B0015N6DBQ|3|It works good in the beginning but, it only last one hour.
B0022H6JQI|5|Unbelievable great product and the price was twice cheaper than in hair salons. My hair looks shiny and heavy and it always smells for the next 3 days as if I wore an expensive perfume. Thank you! Definitely recommend this product!
B00FPKSJDA|5|love this product , very good quality  .<br /> I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.
B00373FE76|2|EXTREMELY hard to see what you are doing, it covers your whole eye, it works a little but absolutely not worth it. I could have done the same thing freehand.<br /><br />Probably going to throw this out or give it to someone...if I can find anyone who wants it<br /><br />Not worth it, would not recommend.
B0013CTO3S|5|the hair was great!! i brought the 14in and it was pretty short.I would perfer u to buy 20in if u want a long ponytail because i used my hair for very small braids i used 2 packs and a half it comes with 2 in pack no white hair very good.I WILL BUY NO OTHER HAIR EVERY and im from the city and where i live now i cant get this type nowhere it was god sent.Love it hope too one day get a pack of bright red.
B000052YHR|5|Best razors hands down. I am a female but prefer these blades since it is less likely to leave razor burn, nicks, or irritation. It gets the job done better than other razors I have tried since the blades are smaller and get in harder to reach places and even though it has fewer blades than the quatro it still had better longer lasting results.
B00JTY6WQ4|3|This is ok, it works for what I wanted it for, but it squeaks !!!
B008MCH5J2|5|I love this polish, its gel and looks great, however doesn't seem to stay on long before beginning to peel, but that isn't necessarily the fault of the polish! Who knows!! lol
B00EP6ABYU|5|This nail polish is awesome!!! Last long, looks wonderful in every mood shade, will def. try more colors!
B007ROD2P2|4|This is a great product for the money! Takes about 4-5minutes to get into full steam. dense steam output with no leaks or splatters.
B003YELGF2|3|I got a knock off version....yea..i didnt really send it back bc for me i couldnt handle that mess at that time and i needed SOMETHING so i just used it...it kinda worked the same but, eh
B00593WQVE|5|I actually bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She recomended it a fews years ago to me and I fell in love with it.  I buy the perfume and not the EDT as it stays on longer.
B00346K5FM|1|I've been testing different products from this brand just to see how they work, but this is one of those that is not up to the standard. The cheapest philip sonicare wil do the job better.
B004GD9YP4|5|I read the other reviews and do have to agree that this product's major downfall is that the consistency needs to be fixed somehow. It seems like there are two parts to this primer, the thin watery part and then the thicker lotion-like part, and they don't seem to mix together very well in the bottle. Both parts are wonderfully smooth and silky, by the way.  I noticed that after several uses, and instead of using the pump (which didn't work well), I mixed it and got it out manually by dipping the bottom of the pump. Bare Escentuals has improved it over the last few years but they still need to fix it. I agree that it's disappointing but the product is so awesome that I hardly care about that. This is the best primer I have personally used. It brightens my face A TON and it makes me look years younger, when used with their foundation. (I would say 7 to 8 years younger, and I am not kidding.) It holds their foundation really well too - it'll stay on all day when I used this primer. I have used the most expensive primers and also the other bare minerals primer without the brightening element. None of them even come close to the performance of this product. I am giving it 5 stars because of how unbelievably well it works, but they do still need to fix its consistency.
B00BCODSK2|5|i loved it when i bought now not so much. its too water based. it doesnt feel moisturizing at all anymore. idk if i should use it all up or toss it.
B001DITLI0|5|While this product is hard to find in many stores it is worth asking them to stock it. It is hands down the best hairspray I have ever used. It also comes in a handy travel size that easily fits in a purse. Love this product!!
B008U12YV4|5|The pouch fits so many small items I carry around daily in a highly organized way. I am very happy with it because now it takes no time to transfer all these items from one tote or messenger bag to another. The fabric of the pouch is soft, and most compartments are padded. The design looks nice. Awesome value and well worth the wait; it is shipped from Hong Kong so takes longer to arrive.
B004R6CAGU|4|This works best for someone with normal to dry skin as it can get a little oily over time. I set with a translucent powder and am good to go. Have repurchased several times.
B001B1SSK6|1|I have been using this product for years and this order was by far the worst.  It left white flakey  residue on my hair.  Somedays I actually had to rewash my hair.  I will never buy This product again!!!!<br />I had to throw 2 bottles away!!!<br /><br />Bernice
B000EBFJXS|4|Having read a bunch of other reviews, I thought that this product may be the \\"wet shave\\" of nose trims.  Meaning that I was hoping it would be more comfortable, closer and a cleaner cut.  Personally I didn't find it to be any better then my Panasonic electric trimmer.  I couldn't get it to cut as close and it did take longer.  That said, it is a very well engineered tool and will be great as a light weight travel trimmer.  For me, I'll probably just continue to use the electric at home.
B00MOKHJGM|5|I received this product promptly. I already feel the benefit from the serum. It feels silky on my skin and also has a tightening feel on the wrinkles. I think that it also may help with dark circles around my eyes. I love this product,
B004VYRUU4|5|Powerful! It works!
B0017HWR1U|1|extremely weak pressure so very little pulsing effect<br />i shld have saved and bought a better product<br />dont buy this
B00I5U1ARE|5|Wonderful! Exactly how it was suppose to be!
B003B49HUG|5|THANK YOU, FOR PACKING MY PRODUCT SO NICE. I LOVE IT, AND THANK YOU. I LOVE HELLO KITTY AND MAC SO IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE MAC HELLO KITTY PLEASE, LET ME KNOW.
B005GXVVH2|5|A great \\"dry\\" oil for hair. I have fine, but dry hair. Argan oil kept split ends at bay when my hair was heavily bleached, and is great to run through after a shower, or mix in with some other oils for a longer conditioning session.   Low/no scent, and the glass bottle is very nice.
B005TNCOQ6|1|was too hard to use u have to wet the sticker and cut it out was too annoying to place on nail correctly
B0049LUI9O|5|Excellent product! Gave it to my husband as a gift because he's wanted a good quality trimmer. He is very pleased with it! Fast shipping, Recommend!
B000C1VX8U|5|My wife love this perfume and I love its smell.
B000PY6F6E|5|Wonderful scent, great S&H.
B001ET76E4|1|Ordered antibacterial and received plain.
B0013YYNDM|4|I would've given it a 5 if I didn't receive it broken.  I know it is shipment problem but it's also the quality of the cap.  The cap does break and it's very likely that the bottles will leak in the package.  However, lucky for mine, it didn't leak.  I had to look for another container to put the oil in.  On the bright side, the oil is good.  It hydrates my skin and it doesn't smell that bad.  :)
B004Y3H7MS|5|Dries black and bleand great wit eye liner . Holds eye lashes very well .
B00AL14SO2|4|Good for little ones
B00ARF44O6|4|I don't care for the sharpness of the teeth on the plastic guard, but it's a nice trimmer overall.  The laser serves no purpose for me, just a neat little novelty unless you're some sort of laser pro.
B00B95HAP8|1|Waste of money, did not work for me at all. Barely any exfoliating beads in it. I get brazilian sugarings and this was recommended as an exfoliating product for that area to reduce ingrowns and provide exfoliation, but it was very ineffective & disappointing. I use the PFB vanish chromabright roller ball which causes the skin to peel, but this did absolutely nothing to reduce ingrowns nor provide any exfoliation in shower. I could've stuck to a pair of exfoliating gloves and regular body wash and saved money.
B00468YD78|5|thought it smelled wonderful great size to carry with you would recommend it to anyone who loves to wear cologne
B00DLRNSSK|5|I got this cream to see if it work with the stretch marks after about three weeks I saw the difference in significantly diminished stretch marks on my stomach. I also used it on my son's scar he fell off his bike and scraped his knees and it was really scarring badly after a few weeks you can see the different his knees are not that scarred as before
B000E7WFUC|5|It is delightful. I receive many compliments on the aroma
B0038EVQLC|3|It's a great product!! I absolutely love it. But I'm only giving it 3 stars because I can get this same product at my local Dollar Tree for $1.06. Total rip off.
B000YUOADE|4|imagine instant relief in a small package? this is what all badger balm do! it works like magic I use it all the time..at work...day..night.
B001F51V48|5|This is a discontinued product that I love, but can't get.  I'll order again, and share when possible. The manufacture changed their line, and many favorite products were dropped for new line.
B002OLR330|5|It really works
B004FP9P0M|5|This incense is fantastic.  This is another product that I have used for years and I keep coming back.  The assortment pack is great for deciding on a favorite and just for changing up the fragrance.  This incense is a heavier incense than a Japanese incense, which I like as well.  It all depends upon ones mood.  This is a real deal incense...way better than anything that you will get at big box stores or convenience stores.  They are worlds apart.  If you are uncertain about getting the sampler pack I suggest starting with Nag Champa or Super Hit as these are two of their most popular fragrances.  if you like the overall quality of those then explore further with the sampler.  One note:  these are hand rolled incense and are sold by weight.  I read online that there are 15 sticks per box.  This is not correct.  Due to differences in thickness and moisture content the sticks themselves are different weights, therefore the number of sticks per box will vary.  I found in my last purchase that the boxes contained from 11-15 sticks of incense.  Still an excellent value and I highly suggest giving this incense a try.
B00538TSMU|4|I bought these false eyelashes just for fun. Are they the greatest ever? No. But the work fine and they don't look ridiculous. Definitely worth the few bucks I spent on them. Shipping was quick. I would buy from this seller again for sure!
B00F008GFQ|5|This brush is great, I use way less product than with other foundation brushes that I have used. The price is great, I recommend it.
B00GWBR5N6|3|Its okay but you just have to get the right size because i didn't and it isnt as affective.
B00MNI1TCK|5|I've used a few Fekkai products and have had very positive experiences, most recently with a creme for coarse hair, so I had high expectations prior to using this texturizer. I feel like I'm one of the few men in the world who will actually admit to blow drying his hair, so I was definitely up for trying to add some texture to my hair before blow drying. Using the product was extremely easy, it went on without a hitch, smelled nice, and I could see a noticeable difference in volume after blow drying my hair. I've been using it for the past week or so and have gotten some nice compliments with a few people asking me if I had done something new with my hair. If you're looking for a bit more volume and blow dry your hair regularly, this is a great product to try.
B006LCFM68|5|Perfect fit for the Samsung Galaxy 4.0 MP3 player. It was easy to slip this right on the player. The case also makes the player slip-less. I sure wouldn't want to drop the player do to not being able to hold onto it. My hands do get sweaty at times when playing games.  You won't go wrong buying this for your player.
B00GDIQ6FG|5|really makes your lashes thicker
B000P20R8I|5|nice
B0084JAE2I|5|No problems
B00AK5BMQ6|5|It is like it is making my teeth whither a little bit than before. i will recommend it to friends.
B004P88JBU|5|I have very oily skin.  After years of trying different face soaps and washes, this by far is my favorite.
B0016O752K|2|I'm not so pleased with this.  It smells okay, but not great, certainly not as beautiful as other Lush products.  It didn't really smell like either almonds or coconuts, which was a disappointment.  I didn't find it very moisturizing, nor is it especially foamy.  It doesn't really work on a mesh sponge, so quite a bit gets used up each time.  Given the price I really can't recommend this product.
B006UMU4NK|1|I received this item broken :(
B00DPE9EQO|1|doesn't do much
B00KEIHJ48|1|I love the lotion -  I am  cranky because I only received 1 bottle - last time I ordered they came in wrapping together as one,  This time no wrapping and only 1 bottle.  I take these when I travel, very handy.
B00IOYEO42|5|I appreciate finding firm toothbrushes!  It is impossible to find them in stores anymore.
B000M2XPO4|2|Did very little for myself-----perhaps I was expecting more.
B00D5TB1LK|4|One of the palette color was broken, the colors are amazing and i love it
B009JOH768|5|such a cool color
B008C13146|4|Have a fair indian skin, it does blend well with my skin tone. Worth the money.
B00GURKRI2|1|I bought these a while ago because I needed new brushes and these looked good. I was wrong!! You'd be better off buying elf brushes or something else. All the brushes are cheaply made and I will never buy any product like this off of Amazon!!
B00HUKV5LG|5|Love this product! You have a customer for life.
B00AEBYP0G|4|much stronger than I realized  works well for about 15 minutes then begins to be painful. terrific for a quick whitening
B000R8QVY4|3|A good shampoo- not as well formulated as I would like. Would need several applications  to do a satisfactory job.
B000RJXUDS|4|So far this has been great to use when inspecting the eye and ear.  I wish there were more clear instructions for the different settings on the opthalmascope.  Otherwise, I'm able to find the optic disc, veins/arteries and the pearly grey + cone of light!! The otoscope uses the standard office/hospital specula that are found everywhere!  It is very light weight with the AA batteries too.
B0002LJ1HU|5|I had a massage at a Spa in Orlando on vacation the first time I encountered this product and it wasn't used on my feet at all. They used it on my back and it was soooo soothing! And now I use it on my back on tired muscles too and it feels wonderful!  Definitely need more and would recommend it!
B002DGV0U8|4|Everything was as it should be except, anyone who has bought cologne or perfume before knows that a new perfume or cologne needs to be pressed down several times before the fluid (perfume/cologne) is sucked up and atomized. However, I have strange suspicions this perfume was either tested, a tester, tampered with (counterfeit), or is just a used product. There is no way to prove it; however, unfortunately, the atomizer was already good to go upon opening when a new perfume product needs to be pressed several times before fluid is actually sucked up.
B000C21CSA|5|It is a very nice product affordable , smells clean and fresh with a bit of spice (love it)<br />I got exactly what I wanted out of this product and would recommend it to anyone
B008BUKUCY|5|I receive compliments from this wig all the time.
B001MA2F2I|5|Great product
B001ZS655U|2|I'm so disappointed on how this came. I have not used the product yet and I'm sure when I do it will be fine since I've used it before and loved it. This product came taped all together in heavy mailing tape. It doesn't come in a box holding all three bottles together it's just taped. That wouldn't be bad either if when removing the tape it didn't leave a huge sticky mess all over my bottles that can't be washed off.
B0001EKQNG|5|I used to get Retin A from my doctor, but ran out.  Afirm 3X does the same thing and the tube is much bigger.  A tiny amount goes a long way.  My skin never got red, just started to dry a little and top layer of skin flaked off and nice healthy skin appeared.  I will continue to use this product.
B00R5GJ9GI|2|Pretty thin compared to other extensions.
B000FKARLC|3|Good
B00467B6JW|1|I ordered this hoping I'll get the product in the picture. Instead, I received the 1-2 erosion level, green strip conditioner, which I can find for half the price anywhere else. The product is terrible, weighs down your hair and makes it look dirty. I returned the product and paid $12 shipping. The seller would not give me free return even though it's a different product than the one pictured. Stay away from this seller and from Kerastase!
B00GPWYF94|5|So. I've purchased this serum twice.<br />It also had no silicone in it and that won me over.<br />Now when I say this working miracles on my face no mean that my friends and family were harassing me asking me what I was using on my face.<br />I suffered from really bad hyper pigmentation from acne and was looking for something to fade my dark spots and this worked amazingly right away I saw results.<br />When I saw the show where Dr.OZ recommended vitamin c serum with phytoceramide, I was skeptical.<br />This serum really works.
B000RDG7DO|4|My 15 year old grandson dyed my hair 4 days ago.  I really like the color.  Came out pretty much like the picture shows, red hair with strong brown tones.  Really goes much better with my complexion then the lighter red tones, which I've tried.  So far, I've washed it once, and had no more 'bleeding' of the color than on any other hair color I've used.  At this point I am very happy with this product and would gladly recommend it for anyone who wants a darker red tone in their hair.  As for covering the gray, you bet it does!  The whole top part of my head is nearly white (without the hair color).  Currently, it is a lovely dark auburn. Got what I paid for and definitely got my money's worth.
B001MIZMJS|5|I start using mouthwash a month ago. This is my first one.<br />I bought this because of the good reviews.<br />It seems good for my teeth!
B001TNW3KC|2|This conditioner used to be amazing, about 10 years ago. Now... not so much. They've clearly switched to cheaper conditioning products.
B004COPU1E|5|the Halls Refresh Tropical Wave Sugar Free Moisture 2.2 oz are very good and do keep the moisture in my mouth.  I was disappointed that they didn't come in rolls like lifesavers.  The person who gave me a sample had them in rolls.  Where are they available like that?
B000J41AH4|5|THIS IS USED IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE HAIR AND SKIN PRODUCTS AND I USE IT ON MY SKIN AT NIGHT AFTER I WASH MY FACE, AND MY SKIN ABSORBS IT IN. THIS IS GREAT MIXING LOTIONS AND HAIR CONDITIONER ETC.
B004I79GYM|5|Keeps the under arms smelling nice, even in hot weather.  Natural ingredients that do not contain cany razy chemical additives.
B000JNQSIQ|5|I purchased this inexpensive clipper to use on my standard poodle. I use the plastic red attachment. She has a lot of hair that grows in her ears and the groomers do not remove enough of it so she shakes her ears when the hairs tickle.  I use this along with the hemostat I had purchased to pull ear hairs from her poor hairy ears.
B00G7SBNJG|5|Great stuff! Doesn't smell and works great.
B004D2C50Y|5|I love this shampoo because it makes my hair feel AMAZING and SOFT and SHINY, but I cannot find it any longer in Walgreens, CVS, or Rite Aid.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  The price is ALWAYS right.
B0049LUI9O|5|I had used a Sharper Image brand before purchasing the Panisonic. This model is very aggressive and gets the job done fast.
B007ZR2T0U|3|I love this color for my toes!  it look gorgeous. Unfortunately it lasts 2-3 days at most before chipping. Almost, but not quite worth it. It does come off fairly easily with remover though.
B00BUF4O8S|5|Jimmy Choo always blows our mind with thier products , but this is a boom!!! great fragrance, lovely looking bottle. Love the lasting nature of the fragrance long after been used it still lingers on!!!
B00AGEPOXS|5|one of my all time favorite eye shadows. I have been wearing for ten years and still get compliments. can be toned down or put on heavy for smoky eyes.
B001ET77YI|5|I love Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap for summertime cool down. I mix it with my favorite body wash because I've always found it to be drying to my skin. When mixed it works great and adds a cooling quality to my skin for about a 1/2 hour after a bath. Refreshing on really hot summer days. Just avoid the sensitive skin areas as it will have a burning sensation, although probably not harmful. I've used this product for 30+ years.
B002DOO1VA|4|I've heard mixed reviews about these brushes, but they've worked great for me so far! First off, I ordered them on a Sunday morning, they shipped the same day, and arrived on Monday morning. WOW! I didn't think I'd even get them until Wednesday, but it was great service.<br />I opened the package and the box was very nice. It had the leather roll with all the brushes inside and a booklet that explains what each is, and how to use them. Each brush was individually wrapped with plastic, and the bigger brushes had brush protectors (which is nice because now I don't have to buy more). I took all the wrappers off and just inspected the brushes. They're all numbered, so you can tell which is which in the aforementioned booklet. They are nicely put together, with no glue showing or any loose parts. There was definitely factory dust in them that flew out when I was feeling the bristles (that's why it's important to wash new brushes before using them for the first time). So, I gave them a good deep cleaning and let them dry.<br />Now the real trial begins... the small brushes have little to no shedding, but the larger brushes shed a bit more. I would expect that, though, because there are so many little bristles packed in to each brush. They are so soft and work really well with dry and liquid products. I was a bit skeptical about using the liner brushes because they seem to be a bit flimsy, but they work perfectly! My only qualm with these brushes is that some of them have a gross animal smell (well, they are badger and goat hairs). I'm hoping that will go away with a few more deep cleanings. It doesn't really bother me too much, though, because they do their job and don't make my face smell like goat.<br />All in all, these are great brushes. I used them recently for a wedding (I am NOT a professional makeup artist) in which I did my makeup as well as 3 or 4 other people's. I just used a spot cleaning in between and they were good to go! All the people said they felt softon their faces, and we were all happy with the final outcome. Thanks, SHANY!
B00FG0AR0W|5|Exactly what I expected looks great
B00J4EZX0U|4|It came quickly & yes it works great!
B002HWS9GG|5|I got this as a gold box deal for 70$ and couldnt have been happier with the impulse buy.  I have a hard time going back to brushing with a regular toothbrush because it doesn't leave my teeth feeling as clean as when I use my oral B.  Tells me how long I have been brushing my teeth for and how long I should brush each portion for, its awesome not having to think when I wake up to brush my teeth.
B00JJXPXMY|5|Most sunscreen prices are ridiculous.  Big Names, blah, blah, blah.  No AD works just as well for most people.
B000SMOHHW|4|I love that mask, it's light-weight and comfortable. it arrived very quickly. the straps do get a bit stretched out pretty easily, but, for the price, it's a great mask. i will definitely be ordering more for myself and friends.
B002N5MIF0|5|This gel is the best I've used.  NO flaking, no itchiness, no helmet head!  My hair feels and looks great using this gel.  The smell is a bit strong if you use a lot, kind of chemical-ish but it has not damaged my hair after using daily.  I bought the mega size bottle knowing it's a ridiculous size for hair gel but I plan to use it long term so why not save some money?
B005WJQUJ4|1|I was so exited about trying out this product, as I was in a beauty pageant and intended to wear a low plunge dress. BIG MISTAKE. After following the directions for using this product I realized that I could have gotten the same results from using masking tape. Using this 'lift tape' will cause your skin to buckle and the 'lift' lasts for all of 5 minutes. Terrible product! Lucky for me I used all four pairs to practice with instead of waiting until pageant day. Thank goodness for 'butt glue'! Totally did the trick:-)
B001ELTPUU|5|Love this product. It really makes your nail beds look healthy!
B004EKVOU2|5|Custom trays came in the mail very quickly and fit perfectly for less than half what my dentist would charge. I opted to purchase a different brand of whitening gel so I can't comment on the quality of the gel included in this package.
B002EECYM2|5|Tresemme sculpting spray is the best hair set I have found.<br />It wourk great!! After washing my  hair, I spray it on, then dry<br />my hair and set.  It holds my hair in place pretty much until the next<br />wash.  I used to be able to find Tresemme at local drug stores. Don't know why<br />it's not available locally anymore. Couldn't fix my hair without it!!
B00ITGOT7W|5|To be honest, I was a little worried the wig wouldn't be very good quality, but I was certainly wrong there. The colours are nice and vibrant, and you can't see the cap at all! I was very happy with this wig. However, the purple and blue at the bottom are a bit thinner than I'd like for them to be, but that's not a very big deal. The bangs are basically just as long as you see in the picture they show you here, though, that was just too long for me. My friend suggested I cut them so they won't be in my face, obstructing my view, but I just used a hair pin to pin them back, since I didn't want to take the chance of messing up my wig by cutting the bangs too short or something. The tail that came with the wig was a bit longer than I'd hoped it would be, so I'll most likely end up trimming that<br /><br />I would highly recommend buying this wig and tail set. You won't be disappointed!
B00H7ISYOW|5|Excellent product<br />Good shipper<br />Would like to order more than one at a time (2-3)
B00O14F3WG|5|I have never used cellulite creams. I honestly didnt believe in this. But after almost a week a can honestly see a difference. It is smoother and less bumpy. This is barely a few days after using it so i can just imagine how great its going to be after a month!  So far so good and i do recommend.
B001CJCFE2|4|I've used this product over the years.  My hair is brown and I tan very easily.  I have brown spots on my face from when I was pregnant and nursing. And I live in teh sun.   This tiny bottle will last you 2-3 years.  It does lighten the spot to your natural skin color, stick with it, and put directly on the spots 1-2 times a day.  I'd reccomend it!!
B004I0DQ0E|5|I have been using this product for years and really love it. Glad to get it at such a good price.
B00243FOGG|2|I must be the exception because I haven't read anything about this happening to anyone else!<br />I have used Proactive for the past couple of years and was getting low so decided to try Acne Free because its cheaper & has great reviews. I have used it for a little over a week and my face, neck, & chest (everywhere I was using it) started breaking out worse than ever!! I have very fair, sensitive skin which I why I got the Sensitive skin kind. I had read all of the great reviews and was convinced it would work :( After my skin started to get worse when I began using it, I searched all over the internet to see if maybe it was normal for your skin to break out before it got better but could not find any accounts of this happening from the use of Acne Free- PLUS the box says you will see results in 3 days- well, the only results I saw in 3 days were more pimples!!!!!! It could be that I am having an allergic reaction to on of the added ingredients, there's no way to tell but I am taking it back because it's obviously not going to work for me like it does for most!I am going to buy more Proactive today because I didnt realize how good I had it. Plus I am going to be more disciplined about using it morning & night because I know that makes all the difference. Sometimes you just have to pay more to get something that works for you.<br /><br />****On a good note***** I was very pleased with the fact that the face wash actually CLEANSED my face, no makeup removing cloths required which is unlike Proactive which requires that I remove makeup before using the face wash because it simply doesn't do the job :  an added expense!!!) They need to hurry up and make Proactive cheaper in my opinion! They've made enough money already!!!
B005AVMPA2|3|Good brush b
B002N5MHLK|5|I am a black male, and I have always had problems with shaving. With this product I love it. It is the best shave that I have ever had in my life.I have not had any shaving problems. I would highly recommend this product.
B004E9EV2G|5|The wax is very good. Goes on easily. Not a bad smell about it. The combo brush/comb is a bit small but gets the job done. I would, and will, buy this product again when needed. I recommend it to anyone needing this kind of product. Not great, but very, very good.
B005TKZS76|4|This s a great set of brushes.  the only thing i would change is that the handles were a little longer.
B004VMGTWQ|5|I use these because, well, I'm just too friggin' lazy to wash my face every night.  I always end up getting soap in my eyes when I'm taking off make-up late at night, and this cleansing wipe does the job without causing any eye injuries to my tired self, which I apprecaite.  I buy it in the double packs and would recommend it to anyone, especially those of us who need a regular face washing routine at night due to make-up, dirt, etc., or to those of us who travel.
B001441WK8|2|Terrible quality. Breaks easily.
B007JUIBUK|1|I keep ordering Clinical and keep receiving Advanced. Different pictures on the add...
B00709OMS0|5|I am a committed user of Lancome cosmetics.  Despite my general positive attitude about their basic makeup products, Lancome does have a very irritating habit of removing my favorite lip colors on a regular basis and not replacing them with a similar product.  Rose Candy is one of those.  No longer available through Lancome or the department stores, I found it still available online through Amazon.  Thank you, Amazon!  My favorite Spring shade of pink is still mine for at least a few more months!
B008GR4L18|5|Purchased to dress up someone in the family for Halloween, we have found this to be of good quality for the small price we paid.
B00GU55IFQ|5|Very creamy with a little bit of a minty tingle. Beautiful nude you can wear by itself for more of a sheer look or overtop a nude lipstick for a more bold look.
B002T3V29Y|4|love this product... :) brought for my sis.. she liked this item. and she appreciate it. she got appreciation from her frnds tooo...
B00LLAR3SU|5|I'm so impressed by the variety and quality of this company's products!<br /><br />This two tone ponytail/extension is no exception.  There's a lot of &#34;hair&#34; and it's securely attached to the band.  The clips are good.  The hairpiece comes well packaged and free from tangles.  I received the black/blue colorway and it's very cool.  What a fun piece!<br /><br />Product received for review.  I love it, and the price is amazing!
B00B1TKY8C|2|Not impressed... the glue attaching the bristles to the handled came apart after about a month of use.
B004BCVM0K|5|Love it
B00387F7EQ|3|My wife uses this product and has for a long time. It is getting hard to get and the stores around us no longer sell it. I have noticed that the string breaks more easily lately and I hope the manufacturer is not skimping on the quality while raising the price.
B00AMA7RR2|5|Quality hair and the best price. As a first time clip on wearer...the price was unbeatable. I colored the hair and it matches perfectly.  As a stylist I would definitely recommend this.
B00BGFJ0VS|3|I like to line the inside of my bottom eye lid...and I always search for kohl kajal pencil liners because they are normally the softest...and these are &#34;ok&#34;..not as soft as I like...but for the price, they'll work...
B00BAZBPZ8|5|Gift
B005UKT9LG|4|I choose a four star rating because, I got the makeup on time, but the black shadow was broken and the pieces and color got all over. Although, that is to be expected when it is sent in the mail. However the color stays on all day with no creasing, and is basically waterproof and sweat proof! I love all the colors, and I would recommend this product to everyone I know.
B005UBN2AO|5|better than the Tresemme brand which I had been using.  No waiting for it to dry, just spray and brush.
B000UZB3Z6|4|good blades
B00SP72Y22|2|Was excited to try the mascara since there were so many positive reviews. The mascara was good, but the fiber material made my eyes itch. There must be a recommendation for removing the product included since it took several attempts to take the product off. I would like to return it as I don't think I will use it again.
B007BLN17K|5|I paid just a little over a dollar for this product so far it's working out great. I use this brush for nail art and I find it really easy to draw beautiful filigree. I can only use the brushes with acrylic paint. Never polish! I only seem to ruin my brushes that way. I can never get them totally clean with acetone. Hate that. There was one little mishap where I spilled a little bit of nail polish remover and my brush got wet. The pretty, slick black façade left sticky black smudges all over my hands and where it had lain on my table. Though with acetone the smudges came off easy enough. These brushes are also very comfortable to hold for me.<br /><br />I was wary because the brushes were so cheap. But I'm definitely happy with my purchase.
B007SNGSFS|5|Great product!
B000BOA1C2|5|Holds your hair tight and does not pull or slip.
B00GYF65TK|5|I know that beauty magazines often tout products that don't do a fraction of what they claim. I'm a big fan of Allure, and in my opinion, they're pretty honest with their claims. They gave OZ Natural's eye gel a top grade, and as I said, they weren't kidding.<br /><br />Works fine with reducing morning puffiness, and best of all, the price is reasonable. My skin isn't sensitive, and I've been able to use their skin care line with zero negative effects, and lots of positive ones. Definitely makes a difference in the appearance of your skin.<br /><br />I am asked to review a lot of skin care products. There are few lines I can endorse as wholeheartedly as I can with OZ Naturals. Really good stuff, and works as well as the expensive stuff at a fraction of the price.
B00EVFSD4K|5|I got this sleeve for my 11.6&#34; netbook and it was a great fit. The pattern distribution is not exactly as shown in the picture, but it is the same fabric. The inside is lined with a really soft synthetic material.
B00N5BLZ46|4|Awesome!!! Works great!!! Looks cool!!!<br />Mine came in blue.<br />Charged it for 6 hours as instructed on the first charge and it lasted for  a few days of moderate use before I had to charge again.<br />Overall, I love it and it seems to be built of decent quality, although the mouth piece could use some improvements in the design. Mine has a defect on the mouth piece, but seems to work fine. Not sure if it just deformed a bit from the warmth or heat but it does not sit flush on the unit. There doesn't seem to be a thread on that part so it is not removable I don't think. It's just a minor visual nuisance and it does not affect the performance as mentioned before.
B0077S1MFA|5|My husband has used this for years...don't know what we'd do without it.  Wish they still sold the liter bottle, but at least they didn't discontinue the product.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|I love it, cleans teeth great after flossing and brushing, easy to use and the price was great
B00SIME904|4|This product seems to work  on my dark spot because after I've used it for  3 days my dark spot is somewhat lighter. I only use this in one  medium sized dark spot on my face not on the entire face as directed.  I'll continue using this product and see how it goes.  So far so good!  I've used several dark spot correctors in the past and this works the best
B00EUFKVQE|5|Works
B00BUQXMIK|3|works but the results fade quickly
B00578Y7P4|1|I tried this and it was awful. It did not work. Don't waste your money. My gel nail polish did not work after this.
B001E725S8|5|I love this toothpaste. It's the only toothpaste I will use. It's a shame I have to go all the way to the UK to purchase it.
B0000798CT|5|Excellent
B002Q6UYEI|2|I have been using Keratin treatments for the last two years. Every time it has been applied at the beauty salon. I bought this product to do it at home. I was not pleased with the results. My hair was frizzy after the treatment. Disappointing.
B0012BNVE8|5|Fit for the purpose
B006IBM21K|5|Great item ... The price was very good ,we use it everyday in the salon and have had no problems.
B001CJFEJU|5|I was using another product and it made my face very oily and shiny.  After reading the review of other users, I decided to try Skinceuticals moisturizer and I am very happy to say that it works really well for me.  I have since switch over to using Skinceuticals product.
B00M1E5G9S|5|good~
B0009OAGRE|5|Love it
B0012XO2W6|3|I like the product from a sunscreen perspective... it seems to black the sun very well which is what I am looking for on my face.  ON the other hand, it seems like since I started using it I have been breaking out more.  I can't tell if this is from the product or just a coincidence (hormones etc.).  If it is NOT causing breakouts, I would give it a 5, but because I am pretty sure it is, I am giving it a 3.  Although everyone has different skin and mine is sensitive and prone to breakouts with many products.
B0016AXNIE|5|I had previously ordered this product and i had noticed good results so I ordered for 1 more month also
B0069SC0OQ|3|Its ok
