0439882826|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic book.  I bought this for a friend's son, and the look on his face as he turned the pages was priceless.  I found myself sneaking it away from him so I could marvel at the pop-outs.  I sat there for an hour just astonished at how creative and well-done the book is.  I also bought \\"Winter White\\" (I think that's the name) by the same author and it was excellent as well.  This is a great gift.

B00124FSXC|3.0|When it comes to great acts and alter egos, none in the 80's really shined like Phil Collins. On one hand, you have him as the hard hitting serious frontman singer of Genesis. While on the other side of the coin, he gained his well-dedicated status as one of the best solo artists of that decade, building crafty hits that remain dominant to this day. While pop hits like In The Air Tonight and Another Day In Paradise have maintained their status as standards, his ballads like Against All Odds have been constant radio staples to this day. But now, Amazon downloaders can have that opportunity to download his love to you MP3 Player.<br /><br />The MP3 version of Phil Collins 2004 Love Songs: A Compilation Old And New, is a bit different than the actual CD double album, but still lags a bit more. The collection includes a lot of Phil's lesser-known songs, most of them that weren't big hits, but also leaving room for some classics. The album includes his big ballads like One More Night, Against All Odds and the delightful diddy Two Hearts from the movie Buster. But, on the bright side of the album, the collection does include a lot of his hits that otherwise was overlooked from his 1998 Hits compilation, including Do You Remember?, the somber and mellow Everyday, and This Must Be Love. There is though a few disadvantages though that flaws this compialtion. The album chooses to have live editions of classics like True Colors and Seperate Lives, instead of the actual studio recorded versions. Also, most of the tracks here are from his 1993 album Both Sides, and chooses nearly half the tracks from that album alone here that weren't big hits like I've Forgotten Everything, Please Come Out Tonight and Can't Turn Back The Years. Another big problem on the MP3 edition of the album, is that it overlooks You'll Be In My Heart, Phil's Oscar-winning classic fromt the Disney movie Tarzan, which was highlighted from the actual CD version.<br /><br />All in all, while Love Songs: A Compilation Old And New isn't a definitive buy for those new to Phil Collins music unlike the way Hits was, it still is a nice trial for those who haven't heard his delightful songs from his 80's and 90's eras.

B000000H5K|2.0|Ok, first of all...is this soulfly or Sepultura. All the tracks on this album sound like a heavy Soulfly. Sepultura has now totally lost their edge with the off-time thrash/death metal that their REAL roots were, what made one of the top metal acts of the 80s and 90s. This album all the makings of a nu-metal(Soulfly) album. Very basic riffs, very stupid lyrics, and very basic jams in the songs. The complexity of Igor's drumming, Andreas' guitar and riffing and Max's growling has all left for nu-metal styles. Igor's playing sounds as simple as Lars Ulrich, Andreas' playing is no longer complex, he sounds we came out of Soulfly with the basic riffs. Max yells at the top of his lungs and no longer has the growl he is known for. The album even has DJ scratching and Jonathan Davis from Korn on the track \\"Lookaway\\". You can't any more nu-metal than having Jonathan Davis cameo on a track.<br /><br />THis album is major disappointment for any one who knows the REAL Sepultura, the pre-\\"Chaos AD\\" Sepultura.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|I really do like this movie.  In fact I've watched it over 12 times.  I recently bought it on dvd, b/c the only copy I had was vhs and our vcr broke.  So I am in the process of converting my videos to dvds.  I swear if they go from dvds to something new, I'll go postal.    Drew Barrymore is wonderful, Riff Raff from Rocky Horror Picture Show is perfect, as really is the whole cast. I believe people of every age will enjoy this movie.  Certain things will go over little kids heads, but the adults will enjoy them.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Firstly, it's almost impossible to talk about Radiohead's seventh studio album, In Rainbows, without saying a few words about how the band initially chose to distribute it.  For those who've been hiding under a rock, Radiohead offered its latest album, at first, as a download only.  They had no label, and when it was first released, not even a plan to get one.  The price for download: the band's website said, \\"it's up to you.\\"  Click again and you're reassured by a second message: \\"Really.  It's up to you.\\"  You could pay as little or as much as you want, including nada, zip, nothing at all, for the brand new Radiohead album.  Legally.    This was a bold move, on several levels.  Not only did Radiohead offer a big \\"F**k you\\" to the labels by cutting them out of the equation entirely, they also took a big leap of faith, asking their fans to pay what they think the music is worth.  There wasn't a better band to do this than Radiohead.  They've always had a bone to pick with the music industry, and given the chance to finally go out on their own, they relished the opportunity.  They're also, frankly, rich enough to take this risk.  It's not clear that smaller bands could really follow this model.  But at this point, as the band themselves have pointed out, it's not intended to be a model: it's an experiment, and it's one we get to participate in with them.    But let's talk about the album.  In Rainbows is Radiohead's seventh studio album, and it's probably the most melodic and tender album they've ever made.  From a band known more for the vicious wail of their guitars and the alienated atmospheres of their forays into electronica, die-hards and skeptics alike might find it startling to see the words \\"Radiohead\\" and \\"pretty\\" next to each other, but In Rainbows marries the notion to the band as never before.  There's a lot of warmth here, from the gorgeous ballad \\"Nude\\" to what can only be described as a love song, \\"All I Need,\\" to the last song, \\"Videotape,\\" a song that, at first blush, sounds  a lot more optimistic than the Radiohead song called \\"Optimistic\\" from their album Kid A.    But scratch the surface a bit - you'll need a few listens before you even get below the veneer - and you'll start feeling the pull from the darker undercurrent that permeates this spellbinding collection.  It's probably a reach to suggest that In Rainbows' songs are strung together by a larger narrative, but thematically, there are connections to be made between the songs.  The lyrics often stand in ironic juxtaposition to the upbeat sound around them, multiplying the impact.  The second song, \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" blasts with the most exuberant sonic firestorm they've made since The Bends; but with lyrics like \\"I'm trapped in this body and can't get out,\\" we shouldn't mistake the tone for celebration.  And for as seductive as songs like \\"Nude,\\" \\"All I Need\\" and \\"House of Cards\\" may seem, the lyrics suggest much darker themes of betrayal, infidelity and mortality.  Against the relief of the gorgeous wall of sound that envelops these words, their poignancy only intensifies.  This time, Radiohead has set us up for a slower burn.    It's probably safe to say that In Rainbows marks a turning point in Radiohead's style.  Should we have expected anything else?  This is a less confrontational Radiohead than what's come before.  But maybe we should have seen that coming.  Compare even the title of their last album, Hail to the Thief, an obvious taunt, to the way In Rainbows sounds when you say it.  That `s the tonal shift you're hearing here.  Kid A put the listener at arm's length; its brother Amnesiac did too, to a lesser extent.  Hail to the Thief was more inviting, but more like an invitation to a rally, or an Orwellian Two Minutes of Hate.  In Rainbows sounds more like an invitation to just come over and stay for a while.  With a surprising amount of string arrangements, swelling sounds, crooning ballads and melodies that unwind into something almost casual, Radiohead seem to be in a seductive mood.  There is complexity and there are surprises for the listener, just as we've come to expect from Radiohead over the years.  But it's a more nuanced, subtler experience on In Rainbows.  There are all the rich textures and layers here to appreciate, if you want to give the music your undivided attention; but unlike previous Radiohead albums, In Rainbows is also content to color the background, painting the room with lullabies.    Jonny Greenwood's guitar work is always brilliant, and on In Rainbows he's finding new directions, with consistently satisfying, intricate and inspired results.  Drummer Phil Selway is also particularly imaginative here, with more than one track where he's mixing up the tempo mid-song.  It's technical mastery, but it also isn't showy: as yet another element contributing to emotional impact, Selway's beats just plain work, and that organic approach is what separates mere wanking from wizardry.  Yorke's voice, it probably goes without saying, is fantastic as ever, shining with special brilliance on \\"Nude,\\" a song they've been kicking around for a decade now and finally laid down in a way they can be genuinely proud of.    The craftsmanship of In Rainbows is unmistakably good.  Half of the songs are already playing in loops in my head, and I'm confident that \\"Reckoner,\\" the album's eighth track, is among the best songs they've ever done.  It's fantastic, really, and yet ... I confess, I still yen for that louder, noisier, and yes, more confrontational Radiohead.  But I'm starting to feel like maybe that's gone.  It's just not who they are anymore.  Radiohead have always been a restless band, ill-content to sit in one place musically.  In Rainbows is the manifestation of that restlessness, but it is also just a more mature album, made by more mature people.  It is their next album, a reflection not of who they were, or who we want them to be, but who they are now, take it or leave it.     I'll take it.  In Rainbows is the sound of Radiohead's evolution, and if they didn't evolve, they wouldn't be Radiohead.  I embrace In Rainbows for what it is: a rich, delicate, gorgeous confection, both sweet and bittersweet.

I then tried it on my DVD player/VCR in my lounge. Needless to say that it played & I really enjoyed the DVD. Incidentally, I live in Manurewa Auckland New Zealand.  I found the sound track on an on-line music site; loved the music so much that I hunted for & purchased the DVD. It was out of distribution in New Zealand so I had to go \\"off-shore\\".    I found it to be a grass roots DVD & not everybody would appreciate the music showcased in the film. ie: It is aimed at an audience that likes the Southern States culture & music of the 1930s.    This Reviewer enjoys the type of music showcased in the movie, so gave it a five(5) Star rating.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|`Sunshine' fills me with ambivalence.  Even though more of a fantasy than science fiction, the film is launched with originality:  A group of young astronauts are sent close to the sun fifty years from now to reenergize its fading zenith.  The plot is as basic as it gets.  The movie is episodic, filled with disasters and treachery with only a little time to pause and reflect.      Bright Spots:    1.) There's a lot to look at with some great shots of the sun.    2.) It's great escapist fun with a trajectory that never gets tiresome.    3.) The only other science fiction adventure about going to the sun I       can think of was the sequel to `Airplane,' and that was supposed to       be a comedy.    Negative Charges (Credibility issues):    1. A flight toward the sun?  Crash and burn.    2. No one acting like they're over thirty allowed on a mission to save the planet?  We could use some maturity folks.      3. Similarly, the cast passed the Abercrombie and Fitch test, but no one      in the crew passed their psychological exams.  Meltdown!    Verdict:  Although sometimes a taut thriller, 'Sunshine''s special effects are the primary agent to bridge the credibility gap.  Just go along for the ride.     (Starring Chris Evans and Cillian Murphy, `The Wind That Shakes the Barley;' Directed by Danny Boyle, 'Millions')

0316067598|2.0|I have nothing but respect for Marcus Luttrell and the other SEAL team members, indeed all the men and women serving in the U.S. military.  The account of Operation Redwing in Afghanistan is indeed quite harrowing.  It's a sincerely personal account, recounted directly by Mr. Luttrell.   I cringed on a number of occasions, though not because of the story.  Rather, I was taken aback by the truly awful writing in this book.      Obviously Mr. Luttrell is not a professional writer.  Patrick Robinson, a \\"bestselling\\" author, is listed as a co-writer.  That suggests to me that Mr. Robinson writes and edits, or at least oversees, the final text of the book.  Either this didn't happen, or Patrick Robinson needs to go back to English Comp 101.  Aside from the flawed writing, there are many pointless diatribes against the liberal media and too many references to God, Christianity, and Texas.  This gets quite repetitious and adds nothing to the story.  I'm surprised Little, Brown let such a poorly worded manuscript get out.  My guess is there was a rush to publish and get the book tour started.      The description of SEAL training is oddly placed in the book and could have been left out altogether since it's independent of the story of the mission.  Moreover, it focuses completely on the physical part of the training.  Paddling, running, push-ups.  The macho stuff probably sells more copies of the book, but I'd be more interested in the SEAL training on communications, reconnaissance, survival techniques, etc.      It's a shame that a story of true courage, duty, and camaraderie is marred by such second-rate writing.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|After seeing this amazing film, I was driven to write a review, but there's nothing I can say about its brilliance that hasn't been said before. One interesting thing was that the film started in 1984 (Orwell anyone?). Most deserved winner of the Foreign Language Oscar (though I admired \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" very much), there is definitely a line that needs to be crossed when dealing with man's inhumanity to man, even after the fact. Costa Gavras' \\"Z\\" immediately comes to mind, but here we have so much more of the human spirit, mostly from the marvelous, late Ulrich M&uuml;he as a man of conscience and a despairing realization of the \\"wrong\\" in which he'd been assimilated. Since this film was released so late, it's now appearing on many 2007 Best lists. It hadn't appeared in many American theatres (if any) during 2006, so maybe the late Herr M&uuml;he could be nominated. He certainly deserves it. Also wonderful are the stunning and subtle performances of Sebastian Koch & Martina Gedeck, as the couple being tormented. This is not a simple story; its complexities are immeasurable, and the absolutely brilliant director, von Donnersmarck, is so sure of his material that no nerve is left untouched.  The DVD extras are very insightful and moving. This is highly recommended. Film-making rarely is more profound, nor as insightful.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|At first I was far from impressed with what I was hearing from Avril on this new album, asking myself why she had suddenly made the decision to switch from more or less radio-friendly music to a feisty punk-inspired series of jams with only a few ballads tossed in between; but then a couple listens later, it seems that perhaps this newly crafted style is even more to my liking. With straightforward angst-filled lyrics, Avril delivers a sound on this album which becomes exceedingly catchy after continual exposure. Although there are a few weak tracks (I find \\"Girlfriend\\" to be a slightly annoying choice for a hit, and the title track also isn't too impressive), they are negated in essence by the stronger tracks. My favorite would by far be the ballad \\"Innocence\\", whose soft piano and heartfelt vocals combine to make this probably my favorite piece from her thus far; I also quite enjoy \\"Runaway\\" (which contrasts acoustic guitar background with a harder guitar chorus) and \\"When You're Gone\\" (really good lyrics on this one; good choice for a hit). Overall, the new sound will take some getting used to, but at least for me it paid off in the end. The tunes are catchy, and in spite of some lyrical cliches, many of them are among Avril's best work. Personally this is my favorite of her CD's now. I would rate it either four and a half or five stars.
B000001Y79|5.0|Amazing CD. It is a must have for any No Doubt or Gwen Stefani fan.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Until yesterday the 1944 version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" starring Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles was my favorite and while I still enjoy watching that early classic I must say that Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are the quintessential Jane and Mr Rochester. They so completely captured the electricity between the two characters, the torment they suffer that I was moved to tears. I will enjoy this story over and over again; it's beautifully shot, acted and directed. Bravo!

If you did imagine King Arthur as Nigel Terry in plate armor, then you were spot on in your portrayal of King Arthur in this movie, Excalibur.    The sex scene at Tintagel really makes this movie. I mean, Gabriel Burn, Uther Pendragon is decked out in plate armor, and he still gets the job done. I feel sorry for the actress though, as it probably chafed her.     This is awesome, and not in a totally lame way either. It's like, you know, way cool.
0679735259|5.0|Nothing to add to what has already been said about this book, it is as good as advertised. Just finished rereading it for the first time in many many years and as the tools now exist, was moved to look for Mayhew's name in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial database. Mayhew the little 2nd Battalion marine that hung out with Day Tripper at Khe Sanh and who Michael Herr claimed was KIA at Hoi An. There is no James Mayhew in the database. There is only one Mayhew listed as killed in Vietnam at all and that one ain't him. Did Herr make this guy up, forget and change his name, or get some bad info on his death? I like to think the latter, that somewhere out there, there is a Jim Mayhew alive and well, maybe still singing ridiculous songs about Oscar Mayer hot dogs. There aren't many books out there that haunt me to the point where I go hunting the ghosts of long dead soldiers. This one has haunted me since the day I first read it and will for the rest of my life.

1590581814|1.0|Following the plot of this disjointed, rambling, and almost unintelligible book is a challenge. It reads like Hemingway reincarnated as Tolstoy. It is not akin to the best of Hemingway - not a very high challenge anyway, and it's not as hard to follow as War and Peace, but almost. You're better off reading the worst of Tolstoy and, in a pinch, the best of Hemingway.
B000ASATYO|4.0|The Frighteners is surprisingly good.  The genuine comedy, special effects, and plot creates an entertaining, under the radar hit.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox plays Frank Bannister, a psychic investigator whose unfortunate past has given him the ability to speak and interact with ghosts.  He uses this gift to fake haunting and paranormal activity within various houses, and then charges those people an exorbitant fee to exorcise the ghosts.<br /><br />Bannister's assistant ghosts - played by Chi McBride, Jim Fyfe,and John Astin, provide superb slapstick comedy and acting support, keeping scenes alive (pun intended).  An excellent cameo by R. Lee Ermey as a dead drill instructor is one of the best scenes for which I could ever have hoped (and it made me crave a sequel to Full Metal Jacket).<br /><br />Bannister eventually has to deal with an evil entity that is killing at an alarming rate.  Each victim is marked with a number on their forehead, and only Bannister can see the numbers.  Will he stop the entity in time to save the town and his friends?  Will he avenge the deaths of those who have been wronged?<br /><br />This movie has suspense, action, and comedy all rolled into one.  There is not much else to ask for in a movie.  It's a pleasantly good movie, well-acted, and clever.  I recommend this movie without hesitation.

B000URDEB0|3.0|Well, it's happened: after years of closeted fighting, creative differences, and sloppily-handled romantic antics, Nightwish founder Tuomas Holopainen got the rest of his band to oust their acclaimed leading lady, Tarja Turunen - a drastic move, since Tarja not only has been the face of the band since its inception but also possesses probably the most celebrated voice in all of gothic metal.<br /><br />Personal resentments aside, this ejection seems to be a calculated attempt to court the mainstream. The majority of the fans that have flocked to the band in recent times did so because they considered [[ASIN:B0002ZYE1Y Once]] to be the best thing in the world: pandering to alternative rock influences, the album was a collection of pop melodies disguised by Turunen's operatic vocals and an orchestral score. Seeing as his fanbase now included fans of Evanesence and bands of the sort, Tuomas figured it was time to display his directive clout and fired Tarja in exchange for Swedish songstress Anette Olzon, whose experience was in [[ASIN:B002BBE60G album-oriented rock]]. Classically-tuned vocals were no longer essential to the band, and what better way to appeal to the American market than to recruit a singer who actually sounds American? Now Nightwish can forget about the defining aspects of their previous ventures and focus on the lovely bones that are turning them into millionaires: pop orchestra and a sexy frontwoman, who rocks and grinds in their music videos like a Playboy model!<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, however, somebody in the band had the idea that in order to prove to older fans that, despite turning into media sellouts, they were still the Nightwish that they knew and loved, \\"Dark Passion Play\\" would have to be more diverse and incorporating of old musical touches that got the band initial fame. That's the gameplan of the album: entice newer fans with super-catchy chart-toppers (\\"Amaranth,\\" \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\"), and keep hold of older veterans with recycled material from their earlier albums (\\"The Islander\\").<br /><br />All that being said, it's still difficult to view the album as empty: sure, it's melodramatic, overhyped, and still inferior to Nightwish's better works (particularly [[ASIN:B000WD66BM Oceanborn]], which the majority of new fans would not have the patience to sit through), but - goshdarnnit - it's an entertaining bit of fluff. Listening to Anette gayly trill lyrics like \\"The never-fading rain in/Your heart that chooses snow white sorrow\\" is the equivalent of a cheap high, as you can hardly help but sing along to a band that's supposed to be composed of head-banging rockers. You can ignore the lyrical undertones of \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" and \\"Master Passion Greed\\" (which attack Turunen and her husband, respectively) for their consistencies as replacement-metal. The rest of the songs are fun, chuckle-inducing filler, with the exception of \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\", which is easily the best song on the entire album: great composition, instrumentation, and creativity. If only the rest of the album had been more like it.<br /><br />Yes, Nightwish is quickly turning into a modern-day Poison: flashy, catchy, and completely undermining their abilities. Tuomas Holopainen's musical ingenuity is being used to ape film soundtracks, guitarist Emppu is distracted enough to get involved in two other bands, and bassist Marco exists solely to belt lyrics in duets and to snarl at the camera during music videos.

B000YENUI6|5.0|In America and much of the West, we're guaranteed the pursuit of happiness; even if it's just the pursuit that's guaranteed.   In some parts of the world, they don't even have that much.  The title of Eastern Promises relates to people who know happiness doesn't exist in their neighborhood, people whose only hope for a richer, fuller life (or even simply one of content) lies in the West.  The future of promise of those from the East (Russia) grows from stories of America, London and the other major cities of the West.  But all too often, the promise is unfulfilled, as played out in the latest David Cronenberg/Viggo Mortensen collaboration.      The diary of a fourteen year old sex slave haunts Eastern Promises.  Her last action on earth was to deliver a child to an idealistic midwife (Naomi Watts), who takes it upon herself to see the child is cared for and to understand more about the young mother.  The more she searches, the uglier the truth becomes, as the pages of her diary recount her plight in the underground prostitution trade from the poorest parts of Russia to the seedy communities in London controlled by Russian mobsters.  Stories of beatings, rapes and forced abortions pale in comparison to the heart-breaking dreams she had about the West, and how those romantic notions were crushed by the ugly truth of her life in London.      The girl's diary directs the nurse to one Russian mob family in particular, lead by a charismatic fatherly figure who feigns compassion for the dead girl.  Watts has an encounter with the old man's driver (Mortensen), the central figure in Eastern Promises, a man who quickly becomes torn between the life he knows and what he knows to be right.  When faced with the opportunity to do right by the dead girl, Mortensen distances himself from all responsibility.  As he says, he's just the driver.     The resulting story contains tricky twists and dramatic (often brutal) encounters.  As with the last Cronenberg/Viggo film, Eastern Promises is so much more than the violence on screen or even the story it tells.  The film speaks to larger issues about the state of the world, and the responsibility of people in the West to continue being more than just a \\"promise\\" of a brighter day and a new tomorrow.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|(\\"In Rainbows\\" by Radiohead)<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews here that can tell you, in full detail, about the long-awaited \\"hard copy\\" release of Radiohead's latest album.  Since I've been listening to the mp3 version for a couple of months now, I definitely agree it's one of the best of '07, which I suppose technically makes the CD version already one of the best of '08 (not that it matters, but let us praise the band for it's release strategy).  You know what would be even better, though?  If the band were to release the COMPLETE \\"In Rainbows.\\"  As many of you already know, when the band announced the availability of their tip-jar downloads, people could also choose to buy a super-deluxe \\"discbox,\\" featuring both CD and double-LP vinyl editions, not to mention art, lyrics and a tantalizing bonus disc.  This would feature 8 new songs not on the main album.  While it's easy to assume these tracks would be castoffs--what were once referred to as \\"B-Sides,\\" it turns out that most of them are every bit as good as the material on the album proper.  While two of the tracks--\\"MK1\\" and \\"MK2\\"--are just short instrumentals (\\"MK1\\" seems to be an embryonic version of \\"Videotape\\") the remaining 6 songs are fully fleshed out, and would make worthy additions to the main album.  \\"Last Flowers\\" is a piano-based ballad that would make a nice compliment to the acoustic guitar-based \\"Faust Arp\\" from the main album.  \\"Up On the Ladder\\" balances a memorable guitar riff with glitchy electronics.  \\"Bangers & Mash\\" is a clattering rocker that could have served to toughen up the album, which is noticeably short on rowdiness (only the wonderful \\"Bodysnatchers\\" really lets loose).<br /><br />Therein lies the rub, as Shakespeare (who I believe, and don't quote me on this, was a huge Radiohead fan) might say.  The only \\"official\\" way to get these songs right now is to buy the full discbox, which the band was charging about $80 for.  Of course, those who didn't feel obligated to pay anything for downloading the original album won't feel any pangs by going to file sharing or Russian mp3 sites.  The same can be said for some of those that did pay.  The current CD edition, needless to say, what I'll refer to as the \\"bare bones\\" edition, even though at only 10 songs and 40 minutes, is a more than worthy edition to the band's estimable catalogue.  I suppose that the \\"full\\" version will be released more widely before too long, and that would be well worth waiting for.  Until then, the album is still a great thing, and many of the extra songs can be found in live performances scattered throughout the vast wilderness of YouTube.  As for why the band chose to keep the album at only 10 songs is something only they can answer (rock history is rife with tales of \\"B-Sides\\" that became hits), and I hope the answer comes in the form of the full 18 song (69 minutes!) \\"In Rainbows.\\"<br /><br />For those interested, the track listing for the bonus disc is as follows:<br /><br />  1. MK1<br />  2. Down is the New Up<br />  3. Go slowly<br />  4. MK2<br />  5. Last Flowers<br />  6. Up On the Ladder<br />  7.

0374280967|5.0|This joyful snack of a book (just a novella) takes the reader into a speculative world - what if the Queen got hooked on books late in life? The worlds that books open for her, the lives she gets to peek into through the pages of literature, change her life profoundly. The funniest parts of this very, very funny book are her interactions with the private secretaries and prime ministers who come and go across her long reign. They just don't get it about her sudden and complete immersion into the lives and ideas she is getting from books. A chance encounter with a bookmobile parked behind the palace leads her into this new occupation of reading, reading and more reading. (The scene of her following the riotous and rather nasty Corgis into the bookmobile is worth the price of the book). Charming, provoking, funny, lovely. A wonderful book.

I hadn't seen this movie for about 23 years!, yet I still remembered much of it!<br /><br />If you're a fan of Sci-Fi, the Aliens, Terminator and Predator Mythos, you should definitely check out this classic!<br /><br />Just be sure to watch it with a light heart, and don't be too demanding and I'm sure you'll enjoy it!

140120306X|3.0|I love the League, which I once described as a 20 page comic book with 26 pages of footnotes.  It is Moore and O'Neill's lavish love letter to turn of the century fictional constructs, and I found the first two books fascinating, as well as a ripping good read.  This book I had mixed feelings about.  The comic book adventure portions were as good as ever.  The written \\"dossier\\" material was much less interesting, and the 3-D section in the back of the book I found completely unintelligible.  I wonder if the \\"dossier\\" was a response to the popularity of the online footnotes to the first two books.  If so, I would urge Moore and O'Neill to stick to the graphic novel portion, and let the readers do the research and write the notes - for me, that detective work was part of the fun.  Warning - nudity and sexual situations.  NC-17 at least.

0374105235|5.0|I bought this book because I have never read anything like this. At first I was skeptical, but after a couple of pages the world the author opened for me was amazing. I could not put the book down until I finished it. A little bit graphic at times, a psychological journey more than a physical one, the story is inspiring. I am not great with words, but I recomend this book to everybody. It is a must read.

0374250324|4.0|In the years following WWII and Korea as the military graduated to fighter jets a certain hierarchy of talent developed.  At the top of the pyramid were those in \\"flight test,\\" where pilots with a certain indefinable something went to push the limits of the newest and most advanced jets.  Landing several tons of metal atop a heaving and pitching aircraft carrier in the dark of night or \\"hanging your hide on the outside of the envelope\\" in experimental jets is a dangerous profession requiring what Mr. Wolfe calls \\"the Right Stuff.\\"  From Chuck Yeager, the first to exceed the speed of sound (Mach 1), to John Glenn and the other Mercury astronauts, few possess this right or \\"righteous stuff,\\" and many are \\"left behind\\" on the climb up that pyramid.  Mr. Wolfe introduces us to those who had it and some who died lacking it, as well as the competition of the \\"Space Race\\" of the 60s, and does so with a very distinct style that conveys the attitude of those who possessed it.  The missions of the Mercury astronauts are covered in particular detail and sort of form the pinnacle of this story, from the enormous egos of some to the petty jealousies and politics that played out behind the perfect facade Life Magazine presented to the nation.<br /><br />In fact, the most singular aspect of this book for me would be the style with which it is written, dripping with the huge egos and arrogance of the pilots.  Theirs is a dangerous job with few monetary rewards, requiring them to sacrifice family life and comfort, but carrying a thrill few people will ever experience.  This, Mr. Wolfe explains, results in a feeling of superiority which he portrays excellently with his writing.  And he conveys this attitude with certain phrases he uses repeatedly throughout, such as the \\"right stuff\\" or \\"flying & drinking, and drinking & driving,\\" or the \\"Friend of Widows and Orphans,\\" etc.  It becomes a kind of shorthand for the concepts within the fraternity of pilots and their families.  It's very interesting to learn of the lives and successes and defeats, particularly Chuck Yeager and John Glenn.  But it is also this style which began to wear on me after a while - on the one hand the story is incredibly interesting, but on the other I got really tired of reading it and couldn't wait to just be done with the book.  Also, the language of the book is pretty coarse, and hardly a page goes by that doesn't have several profanities or vulgarities, so be forewarned if you're bothered by that.  But a fascinating story nonetheless and I can't wait to watch the movie now.interesting to learn of the lives and successes and defeats, particularly Chuck Yeager and John Glenn.

I have four kids, so putting this book down was necessary, but not easy. I sacrificed sleep to get back to it, but it was worth it. This is a great timeless ghost story. I hope to see more from her.
B00005JPTI|2.0|The premise of the movie is so disturbing, that I didn't really enjoy or appreciate the rest of the movie. Civilization as we know it collapses, all the animals too. Human culture, history is gone within 3 years. May it never happen. I feel the flashback technique that is used to tell parts of the story, failed to drive my interest. It should have been used more sparingly - Batman begins, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 are two examples where too many flashbacks only broke the continuity of their story lines. In Equilibrium, a brilliant movie, flashbacks were used more effectively to intensify dramatic moments. Overall, what I found disturbing about the movie is the fact that we learn little about the rest of the world, the US, commercial NY alone seems of interest to the movie makers, a thin story line wrapped in a cheap budget.
B0000047BA|3.0|Miles Davis' trumpet combined with J L Hooker's mumbling and groaning Delta-Blues? Plus Taj Mahal... What a strange idea! Than again, Miles loved strange musical mixes...<br /><br />I guess in a contemporary film noir this might work very well (I don't recall seeing the movie) and, indeed, at times it even works well as independent music, but basically, it's much more of a pleasant background music for blues fans...

I learned it in one night, during an all nighter where I also caught up from being 4 lessons behind in an intensive language course.  I never had to do an all nighter again, and I could run circles around even those students who had spent time in country.  I got all A's in my intensive language courses- a year in a term, 8 semester hours.  THis is a book I give to all the students in my family, and mention to any student in school.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I hadn't seen this in a long time and when I got it on DVD, I had to watch it almost immediately. It's a very odd movie, but I really enjoy it. I would say, however that it isn't for everyone. It's very dark and has some creepy tones to it, but it's an interesting continuation of the story of Dorothy who is longing to go back to Oz and finds that a lot has changed since she left, and not for the better.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|Although I enjoyed this movie on the basis of pure entertainment with little expectation of other intellectually redeeming values, the scene in which Peter upstages Mary Jane in the bar was stunning to me for its raw vengefulness. Otherwise, the acting in general was so-so, about on a par with the previous iterations and about what I expect in the superhero/comic book genre.
B0000026J6|5.0|I am both young enough and old enough (at 37) to remember what a shock it was when this album came out.  The shock consisted in Leonard Cohen making a really cool album.    I mean, for those of us who had been teenagers in the 80s, Leonard Cohen was just about the opposite of cool.  He represented something, we weren't quite sure what because few of us had actually listened to him, but it certainly wasn't good melodies, effortlessly slick production and mountains of attitude.  We were, let's face it, ignorant and shallow.  There was already a wealth of great music recorded by Mr. Cohen before this album came out, but our ears had been dulled by terrible 80s pop music and we had never listened to it.  It so happened that this album was in an idiom familiar enough to be acceptable, but was also deep, dark, strange, sardonic and, at times, heartbreaking enough to stop us in our tracks.    If I had to play somebody something to convince them that Leonard Cohen is, at the very least, one of the most lovably cool and funny and romantic singer/songwriters out there, it would be this album.  There's not a dud track on it, which is more than you can say about some of his earlier work.  'First We Take Manhattan' is superbly menacing; 'Jazz Police' is nightmarish and flip at the same time; 'Take This Waltz' will bring a tear to your eye; 'I'm Your Man' is as gruff a love song as I've ever heard; 'Tower of Song' is just one of those songs that's so grimly funny as to be beyond criticism.      Fans could argue, with some justice, that there are other albums that are more representative of the man, or which are less sardonically amused and more tragic, or which have just more classic tracks on them, but this is still one of Mr. Cohen's finest albums, a beautifully wary marriage of Armani form and rag-and-bone-shop-of-the-heart content.  If you know his work you already know this, so what are you waiting for.  If you don't, and associate Leonard Cohen with depressing acoustic guitar ballads - well, you've got him a bit wrong, but in any case you will find nothing like that here.  Check this out and let your head and heart open up the lines of communication once more.
B000003CKH|4.0|About the same time that Korn started to get popular, this group suddenly popped onto U.S. airwaves with the song \\"The Distance.\\" I remember that single was probably the coolest song since Beck's first single \\"Loser.\\" It was a song about lost love and racing. It had a thumping dance beat, squeeky synthesizer effects, horns and the smoothest bass line ever.<br /><br />Although no one would think that so many sound effects would make an incredible song, it worked. And the album was a hit. Even today, this album is an excellent piece of work. With this work, Cake transcended the genres of ska and funk rock, switching punk rock beats for hip-hop beats. In fact, they were even more successful than another group with the same hip-hop sensibility, Soul Coughing.<br /><br />The clean electric guitars may sound very simple, but Cake lays on some killer guitar solos, especially on their awesome cover of \\"I Will Survive.\\" The horns also play a crucial role, adding a mariachi sound to the songs \\"Frank Sinatra\\" and \\"Daria.\\" And yes, the main singer even mouths out a phat, obscene rap in the song \\"Nugget.\\"<br /><br />Although kids might not be able to play this album without getting their mothers aggravated (the singer compares fuzzy dice to testicles in one song), this album is still one of the coolest things I have ever heard. The only group with the same nutty sense of humor today might be \\"LCD Soundsystem.\\"
B000TLMWMY|4.0|I don't remember seeing the Johnny Cash show when it first aired,(I was too young)and I don't think my parents do too. They always liked country music and had Hee-Haw, The Tommy Hunter show, Dolly, Barbera Mandrell, etc. on the T.V.(that much I do remember)so, they probably did watch this show. I never cared much for country music when I was young but when Johnny came on T.V. well, that was different.I always found him different from the other country hick singers of the time, he seemed more of a rebel, dangerous, you'd almost say with his deep voice, black clothes and dark music.     Fast-forward to today. As I've grown older I've gained an appreciation for those corny hick country stars of yesteryear I used to scoff at. When I viewed part of this DVD compilation on PBS, I was intrigued and very thankful that somebody had the forsight to create this time capsule ,of sorts, for future fans to see. I bought this for my parents for chistmas and have heard nothing but good reviews from them (hopefully they'll let me watch it one of these days).So buy it!!!

B000YXMMAE|5.0|I should preface this review by admitting that I was never (until now) a Radiohead fan, beyond hearing Creep on the radio, I had no interest.<br /><br />I am 50 years old and Radiohead is just not my era, not my thing right?<br /><br />Fortunately, even at my advanced age, I am still passionate about music, (I still play drums in a cover band) and have been, for years, looking for a band on radio or video not from \\"my era\\" that could give me goosebumps,(Green Day came close for me with \\"American Idiot\\") \\"In Rainbows\\" is that record.<br /><br />The album was first brought to my attention by professional drummer Billy Ward,  Billy has played with Joan Osborne, Robbie Robertson, and Yoko Ono live and in the studio, I was skeptical, and frankly, puzzled that Billy jumped on this record.(Now he says I have \\"swallowed the blue pill\\" because it is hard for me to contain my enthusiasm and stop nattering about Radiohead on Billy's site and in e mail.)<br /><br />Many times, listening to todays bands, I felt certain that I would never find a connection to any band from this century, but that ended when I saw the Scotch Mist television broadcast on Current TV.<br /><br />To me, the greatness and stark beauty of classic albums like \\"Dark Side Of The Moon, Abbey Road\\" and Chris Whitley's \\"Living With The Law\\" real masterpieces, is all over this album. The IT that makes a masterpiece consists of so many layers that it is impossible to pinpoint, but I really believe Radiohead have achieved this.<br /><br />Radiohead are a band that deserve your time and attention, the songs, musicianship, production, are fluid like lava and shimmer like diamonds, these songs will soak into your DNA.

B000F3T3CS|3.0|I must confess that I went to sleep twice during Act I of this performance, and had to chop the entire opera into three slots to view, some thing that happens very rarely with me.<br />What's the distraction?<br />I would not call it 'unprofessionalism'. It is as clear as mud that the distractions were meant to BE there, just that I do not find them tasteful.<br />The first major distraction is the staging. Cannot imagine it is the Vienna Stateopera that this production was being staged. May be I have been spolt by the MET productions on DVD. It looks crowded - the stage in Act I is unduely crowded, and the chorus appear to move as if sleep walking throughout the Act.<br />Things turn much brighter with Dulcarmara and Nemerino's famous duet in the second Act. However, things quickly relapses into chaos when Belcore returns with Adina. However beauteous is Anna Netrebko's person and voice, the characterisation of this Adina is not served by having her twisting her body and hurling her limbs every time an emphasis of emotion is being called for. This is the second big distraction of the drama. This is a sort of 'over-acting'. Adina is supposed to be a self-righteous and heady sort of girl. This production's Adina is however a feather-headed, giddy walking doll.<br />Rolando Villazon characterises Nemerino in more or less the similar manner. He got his nick-name 'Mr Bean' as a result of this.<br />No such visual nonesense from Nucci or d'Archangelo.<br />There are some strong vocal performances in this production, though. D'Archangelo and Villazon gave a wonderful duet, and Villazon generally proved himself to be a true vocal talent. Netrebko's coloratura hasn't improved since her Kirov days, but the gorgeously even voice made up much for the lack of vocal technic.<br />This production would probably benefit a lot more if a CD is issued in lieu of a DVD.
B000WC3AOE|1.0|Just returned the HD-DVD version of \\"That's Entertainment\\" for a refund, since it wouldn't play at all on my Sony DVP-NC85H, either in HD or standard DVD resolution.  A Hawaii product I bought on the same order (HD Window: Hawaii [HD DVD]) performed perfectly on this same machine, through hdmi cable to a Phillips 32\\" LCD TV (720p).    At first , I thought there was a possibility I'd gotten the Blu-ray version by mistake, but the order form is very specific about it being the HD DVD product, and the covers on the DVD's said nothing about it being Blu-ray.    I'd really like to have the HD version of this show, but won't reorder it (hoping that the item we received was simply mismanufactured), unless someone else has had the same problem and has found a way to resolve it.  Any suggestions?

1416550518|5.0|I'd read this book through my book club and loved it. The book is reminiscent of Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier and the book shares the same sense of mystery and gradual unfolding.  The main character and narrator, Grace, is more strong willed and simpatico - and you find yourself completely drawn in.  Throughout the many twists and turns, the book remains unpredictable and totally absorbing!
0060254920|5.0|I do not know of anyone who does not know of this book, it seems so much embedded in everyone who has been a child in the last 40 years, and now their children also.    The hardcover is something you definately want as a keepsake and so it holds up with the repeated readings it will gather over and over.    One of the Top 10 must-have childrens book of all time.
0525950079|5.0|Follett used to be a great writer up until about \\"A Dangerous Fortune\\" when his books drastically deteriorated.  I had therefore given up on reading him until the buzz around this book intrigued me.  I remained sceptical for the first 20 pages especially since I do not easily commit to a book of such intimidating length but the writing was so good that it just kept flowing along.  By about P. 50 I could see the book's outline and great premise and by p. 100 by which time all the characters have been fleshed out I was completely hooked.  This is Follett at his best.  The characters are finely drawn and so vivid that I had no trouble remembering all but the most minor.  The background is richly populated with the panoply of late medieval England in all its bawdiness, brutality, and ignorance.  The fictional town of Kingssbridge and the county of Shiring come off the page and its fascinating characters live and breathe in your head.  The bonus, as in Pillars of the Earth\\" to which this is the notional sequel, is Follett's extensive research into the architecture and building methods of the period which are explored through Merthin, one of the main protagonists.  To the detractors in other reviews who say this should have been called \\"Book without End\\" I say more apt would have been \\"Book you don't want to end\\".  Admittedly, though, the title could have been better chosen, coming from a mistranslated medieval prayer.      It is amazing that a book of such rich detail and exhibiting such dense research could also be a drama that is so difficult to put down.  With this book the old Follett has returned to the heights of \\"Man from St. Petersburg\\", \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and of course \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" all of which I highly recommend in about that order if you have not already read them.  The book stands completely independently from \\"Pillars\\" and both can be read in either order.  I read someplace that Follett said he wrote the book to see if he could write somethingas good as \\"Pillars\\" again (paraphrase).  He has succeeded beyond my highest expectations and I eagerly anticipate his next.

It's like The Wizard of Oz. Some films are too good to be disputed.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I admit, I didn't want to like this show.  After all, it replaced my favorite CBS sitcom from the previous year, The Class.  But I gave it a chance, and I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />The Big Bang Theory tells the story of 4 young geniuses, as they find it will take more than book-smarts to navigate the unchartered waters of relationships in the real world.  Into their world of role-playing games and physics in-jokes comes Penny, a beautiful waitress who somewhat reluctlantly becomes the guys' guide to life outside their academic shells.<br /><br />What really sets the show apart from other half-hour comedies is the writing.  You'd probably need an advanced degree in math or science to know whether some of the jokes are based on real concepts, but it doesn't matter.  Just watching the two leads (flawlessly played by Johhny Galecki and Jim Parsons) try to co-exist with Penny living across the hall is pure comic gold.  Jim Parsons (as uber-nerd Sheldon) may be the funniest comic actor on t.v., and it will be a shame if he doesn't nab an Emmy nomination for his work here.<br /><br />If you haven't been watching The Big Bang Theory, give it a try.  And if you have seen it, I hope you'll join me in voting for a DVD release of this bright and funny show.
B00011RPB0|2.0|Okay I'm a native Japanese born and raised in city of Fukuoka (1.5M people) (Fukuoka is mentioned (briefly) in the movie!)    I'm telling ya that Tokyo is a dead city which is constantly dying even further, but Fukuoka is much more international, cosmopolitan place and people are happier and less cold there. Yokohama(Kannai and Minato Mirai 21) is underrated too.    Basically, I didn't understand this film. Even though I do understand that this movie is about culture shock. I suppose that what kept me from enjoying this film is, whether intended or unintended, emphasis on strangeness and weirdness, even to the eyes of most of the Japanese.    Which are... the leg-wiggling Tokyo prostitute shouting \\"lip my stocking! oh! oh!...\\" etc... and the old man sitting on a lined up chair, pointing at the air, moving his finger around, around, and around....   you know, not all Japanese are like that.    About the imagery... at first I thought it was like a cheap home-movie. But when I watched it the second time, I saw some elegance     I am deeply compassionate about the loneliness of Bill Murray, but somehow not of Sophia. I don't know why... She was listening to this self-help CD even though she is not from any west coast hippie towns in the United States... hmmm, strange. Oh well.    In conversations in this film. I find a lot of intelligence and elegance, and (only) some snobbishness which I like (I mean it.) So I give this movie another star.

B000BB1MI2|2.0|A typical Tim Burton film.  Very big and bold graphically but it lacks the human touch of the original.  The musical numbers are pretty good, but again I find that the originals were a bit better.    If you only want to buy 1 movie get the 1971 original film.  It is much better!

0143038419|1.0|This book is highly frustrating.  I can't decide if it's because I'm jealous of her ability to pick up so hastily and take off traveling for a year to experience pleasure... (while I'm \\"trapped\\" in my conformist life of having a hubby, job, and 2 kids) or if it's because what she is looking for is not being found abroad, but rather within (I don't think she realizes that).  How nice to experience such pleasure, devotion, and self-absorbed meditation for a whole year!  There is no balance in her life at ALL, contrary to what she states.  Wouldn't we all be better off dumping our husbands and experiencing pure hedonistic experiences whilst the rest of the world is busy living?  And then writing about how nice is is to \\"find\\" herself among beautiful people and good food?  Ugh.  How can I learn any valuable lessons from this.  Very unrealistic.  Show me someone who finds themselves while using the tools of reality.  Then we'll talk.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I've never heard of these guys before until I brought the disc home from the library.  I was quite impressed and I'm planning to listen to their other album.  I like the heavy guitar riffs and the voice adds a little classic heavy metal sound, which I like.  They lyrics aren't bad either.
B000003N7K|5.0|Ooh-la-la...what an incredibly sensuous and smoldering album featuring legendary John Coltrane and terribly under-rated baritone Johnny Hartmann. This album is so sexy for a romantic evening. Yep, plenty of babies will be conceived with this album. Coltrane's playing is entrancing on these jazz standards. Hartmann's vocals are unbelieveably smooth and his vocal phrasing is simply amazing. I cannot understand why this man was not a huge superstar at least on par with Frank Sinatra. Every track on this album is alone worth the purchase price of this disc. However, \\"My One and Only Love\\" just sends chills up the spine. Definitely add this to your easy listening/jazz collection.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|Quoting most of motoJB but with WAY different results.\\"A very over the top, ridiculous, goofy and mindless shoot 'em up movie.\\" This movie was a gas!

B000Y179KO|5.0|The Eagles', Long Road Out of Eden, can best be characterized by a signature line from one of its finer songs: \\"This is not the Center of the Universe/That's alright with me.\\" Unpretentious, unashamed of its own eclecticism,  unafraid of commercial consequences, the band re-establishes itself, not as a nostalgia act, but as a group of artists standing on solid moral ground as they survey a society ''bloated with with entitlement,\\" feasting upon \\"cultural junk\\".  And yet, they do it the California way. Their harmonies evoke the Beach Boys and a certain quality of sunlight, even as they lament our current debased place in the world. There's some lyricism, some family life, and some romance as well. Joe Walsh's lovable miscreant tunes provide real world relief for those in the bar who care to listen, as they consume refreshingly progressive politics with their peanuts. The fact that this fine double album, the Cali equivalent of the White Album, was marketed mostly through Walmart was also a compassionate, non-elitist masterstroke of heart and mind. Massive slack may be cut for the righteous.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|If you love \\"The Princess Bride\\" and are looking for another movie in that vein, this could be a candidate, but lacks that great movies wit and knowing humor.  While this is a fantasy and its special effects are far superior to \\"The Princess Bride\\", its story has less to it.  This is a straight love story much like the fairy tales of a beautiful princess and a handsome prince finding each other despite all the world's obstacles and his apparent lowly birth.  So, if you like fairy tale love stories and elaborate special effects, with some decent (but not great) humor along the way, this movie is one you will likely enjoy.<br /><br />The story involves a town in England that has a stone wall dividing it from some strange world no one must ever enter.  There is an old man guarding a breach in the wall, but young Dunstan Thorn (eventually, Nathaniel Parker) gets past and meets a beautiful girl (Kate MacGowan) being held as a slave to a witch.  Nine months later a baby boy is brought to him and he raises Tristan (Charlie Cox) with love and care.  Eventually, the young man falls for Victoria (Sienna Miller), but his affection is not just unrequited, but rejected.  Somehow, Tristan's good heart and genuine affection wring out a commitment from Victoria.  If he can retrieve the falling star they saw crash into the strange world and get back in a week, she will marry him.  Tristan sets off on his journey and the strange adventures being.<br /><br />Why the star fell and all those pursuing it for their own various purposes is what drives the story of the film.  Robert De Niro's Captain Shakespeare is the one plot point that has nothing to do with the falling star, but is key to what eventually becomes of Tristan and the Star.  His character also has a lot to do with a comic diversion to lessen some of the frenetic pace of the movie.<br /><br />Not great, but quite enjoyable.  A good family film, to be sure.  Not exactly a chick flick, however it is a love story.  In any case, I enjoyed it.  I didn't mention the roles that Peter O'Toole, Michelle Pfeiffer, and a bunch of other fine actors do in the film because I want you to enjoy the story for yourself.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MImention the roles that Peter O'Toole, Michelle Pfeiffer, and a bunch of other fine actors do in the film because I want you to enjoy the story for yourself.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|I was eager to see this movie after reading all the reviews.  I am not really a great fan of thrillers but this one had me on the edge of my seat.  The directing is wonderful and the movie is really excellent, so from that perspective I was really pleased.    So why the 1 star?    The DVD transfer is probably one of the worst I have ever seen (and I have a LOT of dvd's).  The pixelation/artifacting is so pronounced that it really detracts from the viewing of the movie and creates a real distraction to any real enjoyment.  Almost every scene has some form of really pronounced mpeg artifacting and this really should not have been released as it is.    The DVD just feels like is was rushed into production with so so quality. I can't speak to the quality of the BD version but the DVD version is really terrible.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This five-DVD release is packed neatly into a small briefcase along with a toy spinner (a car), an origami unicorn, a hologram of Deckard at work, and examples of storyboard artwork.  It is \\"quite a prize\\" and something for Blade Runner fans to revel in.  If you feel that you don't need all of these goodies, however, you can still opt for \\"Blade Runner - the Final Cut 2-Disc Special Edition,\\" giving you the definitive 2007 version of Blade Runner, the documentary on the film (\\"Dangerous Days\\"), and more bonus material.<br /><br />There are many Blade Runner reviews already posted and I risk being completely redundant.  I  saw it in its original theatrical release in June of 1982.  I didn't own a VCR so, with the idea I might never see this movie again, I went back to the theater the next day, pen in hand, and scribbled down as much dialogue as I could, including, of course, Roy Batty's iconic farewell speech.  I needed to keep it forever.<br /><br />Blade Runner is set in Los Angeles in 2019.  I recognize my city:  the storefronts, street crime, red horizon, endless skyline and congestion.  The grimy rain depicts a city of dashed hopes and depression, yet Blade Runner ultimately discovers a passion for life that is \\"genetic.\\" Roy Batty became my hero by defying his world.<br /><br />If you are new to Blade Runner I recommend watching the original 1982 Theatrical Release first.  I believe it is closer to the mark than is now acknowledged.  My hands down \\"favorite,\\" however, has become the 2007 Final Cut.  It is reworked to repair the slip-ups and also expanded somehow, taking a little more time and revealing the film's soul.  I discovered Pris in this version -- her conversations with Sebastian reveal tenderness and compassion.<br /><br />Another version of interest in this set is the Workprint.  It uses an even clumsier voiceover than the 1982 Theatrical release and the second half of the film is scored with awful music, exposing the actors by removing the support of Vangelis' miraculous soundtrack.  Now we see what powerful performances these actors brought to the film:  Rutger Hauer, is absolutely real, terrifying, intelligent, physical; Harrison Ford truly brilliant in a difficult role where his contribution has become underrated.  Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, and Brion James are all great.  Thanks to each of you.  And thanks to Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Blade Runner has become a classic and this collector's edition provides much to study and discuss.  I can throw away my scribbles now.rack.

But isn't that what you want?  When you buy the Eagles, you want them to sound like the Eagles.  Well, you are in for a treat b/c you get that plus some new, extraordinary songs, track after track.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's one of their best mixtures, complete with some blues, sangria, 70's and a little jazz, all in one little red package.

B000Y7U98C|2.0|Given its trailer and Boyle's credentials I though this should be REALLY good...it started out great - the cast is terrific, the camera work is superb and the musical score is top notch. Too bad the film degenerates into something less than it should be by the time it's over. Lots of questions as to who and why the main protagonist is and acts the way he does abound, stupid plot contrivances, and a sense of lost focus plague this movie in the last half hour. I'm disappointed with this one.

0790729725|5.0|I saw this film on \\"Sweetest\\" Day (a completely useless holiday) with a love interest, and dammit, it was worth pissing her off because I saw a great film.  This is my favorite Scorsese picture, one of the best gangster movies ever made, and the film that Marty should have won an Oscar for.  It may not have the autumnal darkness of The Godfather films (at least one and two), but it has an exhiliartion and love of the medium that the Godfather films lack.  This is Scorsese's most cinematic film, where the camera work (by Michael Ballhus) is quite amazing to behold.  The unbroken shot when Ray Liotta and Lorraine Braco walk into the restaurant is as classic as they come.  It is one of many classic moments in a film that's filled with them.  The 2 1/2 hours fly by, and the film doesn't really sugarcoat the gangster life in any way.  No moralizing, no preaching, Marty just shows you how it is.  The V.O. narration works brilliantly here, and every performance is perfect.  Pesci (who won an Oscar), De Niro, Bracco, and Liotta (whatever happened to him, eh) should be commended for their work here.  Forget The Departed, this is Marty's masterpiece, the won he should have won the Oscar for.

A friendly salesperson in a moviestore I use recommended the movie, I loved it and after finding out that it was based on the cancelled series, bought the boxed set.     The series are marvelous. Wonderful characters, very good acting, good settings. Nice balance of heroic and ridiculous. Real emotions and real reactions to developing situations. I lately feel fed up with grandiose special effects and Firefly's gritty feeling of frontier reality was wonderfully refreshing.    The thing to do for Fox would be to re-start the series while the cast is still available (and close in age to the Firefly crew). I write this from Russia - would Fox be interested to know that a lot of people here bought the boxed set and ther are some real \\"browncoats\\" in MOscow?

B000L43AN4|5.0|...not so much because the music reflects every single phase of Tom Waits' distinguished history (it doesn't really have anything that sounds like his first few albums), but because it's very hard to believe that such a massive and diverse collection of songs could simply be Waits' latest release.  Sure, some of these tracks are reissued from the last ten years (soundtracks and other compilations), but for the most part this three-disc collection shows that Tom Waits has apparently got an inexhaustable muse.<br /><br />\\"Orphans\\" is an ideal purchase for both the long-term, diehard Waits fan AND the curious newcomer looking to find out about him.  There are so many great songs it's pointless to discuss them all, but I think \\"Tell It To Me\\" might be the prettiest tune Waits has ever written.  Meanwhile, \\"Lie To Me,\\" \\"2:19\\" and his cover of \\"The Return of Jackie and Judy\\" (one of two Ramones covers here) rock as hard as anything he ever did.  And for your more wigged-out moods, try \\"First Kiss\\" or \\"The Pontiac\\" on for size.  There's something for everyone!<br /><br />Special mention goes to \\"Sea of Love\\" - Waits turns the original (a fairly formulaic love song fit for high-school dances c. 1962) into a spooky, bluesy moaner, with a brilliant lyrical twist in the chorus.<br /><br />For an artist to come up with this much new and worthwhile music 35 years into his career is an absolute inspiration.
B000002GXS|4.0|Tom Waits-The Heart Of Saturday Night *****<br /><br />If Tom Waits' 1973 debut album Closing Time was the amazing start it is often written to be (which it is) then The Heart Of Saturday Night is nothing short of a stroke of genius! Combining what made his debut so great (beat-generation lyrics and imagery and soulful vocals) with a new even slicker, cooler style, and a hint of jazz his sophomore album had all the right touches of a classic.<br /><br />Long considered to be Waits' best album, or at least along side Rain Dogs, The Heart Of Saturday Night is phenomenal. Housing such felons as `New Coat Of Paint' `Shiver Me Timbers' brilliant tribute to his young days working in a pizza parlor `The Ghost Of Saturday Night' and the incestuous title track `The Heart Of Saturday Night.' Bette Midler went on to do a surprisingly decent cover of `Shiver Me Timbers' on her biggest album of the decade which created way for Midler and Waits to do a duet of their own on her next album.<br /><br />The Imagery flows through Waits' lyrics like heroin into a junky's mainline. Songs like `Diamonds On My Windshield' evoke scenes of Jack Kerouack during On The Road; while the title track sends a feeling of longing and lost through your veins like electric shock. The man can write!<br /><br />The instrumentation is subtle on the album but no less impressive. It serves it's role without out doing the other pieces of the album. Waits' piano work is especially impressive. Musicianship is something that Waits is always overlooked for as well as his amazing ability to write one slaying melody.<br /><br />The Heart Of Saturday Night is the total package. For the best of early beat-era/crooner Waits this is the place to go, rivaled only by that of the great Rain Dogs. For a great Waits album, look no further.

B000002GYR|5.0|Tom Waits-Closing Time *****<br /><br />Closing Time, Tom Waits' 1973 debut album is long removed from the alternative road he helped to pave from 1982's Swordfishtrombones thru today. No this is much different. Much more subdued, and accessible. Closing time is the outside window look into that of a post-modern beat poet. A more adventures William S. Burroughs, and yet a much less adventures William S. Burroughs. Tom Waits was one of a kind right from the start.<br /><br />He had yet to unleash his signature vocal structure to the world but hints of it still come through on Closing Time. And while his voice might not all be here his knack for the perfect melody is. Songs like the melt in your mouth good `Martha' and soon to be destroyed by the Eagles `Ol 55' showed what Waits would be overlooked for the rest of his career, his amazing musicianship.<br /><br />As a lyricist Waits is more of a Poet. `I Hope I Don't Fall In Love With You' and the ultra hipster `Virginia Avenue' is straight poetry. The omega cool cover of `Ice Cream Man' is light-years ahead of the original, and much more sleazy.<br /><br />Now some Waits purest will say this is too polished, which is understandable being as the man hates to even hear the word polished. But this is a great album and you have to start somewhere, and what a wonderful place to start. Waits got it right the first time, do not let anyone tell you otherwise.

B000002513|4.0|Bruce Springsteen-The Wild, The Innocent & The E. Street Shuffle ****<br /><br />With Springsteens debut album, Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ he showed us just how promising he was as an artist but never reached it. Well His follow up The Wild showed us just how ambitious his talents were.<br /><br />The was the earliest carnation of The E. Street Band with out it actually being the E. Street Band. Clarence was here and the feel of the E. Street was as well.<br /><br />But what this album has asside from everyother Springsteen album is a jazz feel. All his other albums have slices of it thrown in but this is essentialy a jazz album played by a rock band. The musicianship is very tight, yet loose at the same time. And the lyrics in my opinion are more Van Morrison then Bob Dylan any day. With the exception of 'Rosalita' which is classic Dylan in his Blonde On Blonde days.<br /><br />'4th Of July' is slower then the rest of the album and is acoustic but is maybe the most powerful song on the record. The imagry evoked in this song alone solidifyed Springsteen as the true poet his then since been known. 'Incident On 57th Street' is just sexy cool rock n' roll played with a laid back feel. While the album closer depending on who you ask is either the weakest or strongest track on the album, it's a personal toss up, and one that can only be appreciated or hated upon a few intence listens.<br /><br />The Wild, The Innocent & The E. Street Shuffle showed us what was to come from Bruce Springsteen and The E. Street Band for the rest of the 1970's. While he would tone down the poetry in his lyrics slightly toward the end of the decade this album really set the mood for what they were to release. At this point I think the boys were just having fun and toying with us in the process. A must for any REAL record collection.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is really a lot of fun.  I didn't expect to like it at all.  It kind of looks lame and cliched.  The performances however are very good and the story is whimsical.  It really reminded me a lot of the Princess Bride -- if you liked that you'll almost certainly like this.  The story is pretty straight forward, but I guarantee that if you get started wwatching it for a half hour then you'll find you can't walk away.  Deniro's performance is especially funny.  You can't go wrong with this one.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|I heard a lot of complaints about this movie, and so i wanted to see it for myself. I wasn't looking for a movie that would win many oscars, but rather an entertaining movie from start to finish, and that was exactly what I got. From the get go this movie is filled with action. I hate how people complain about stuff that isn't realistic...and yet they believe the scenes in Live Free or Die Hard where Bruce Willis is on top of a jet, and throws a car at a helicopter. Live Free or Die Hard is still a better movie, but the scenes are just as ridiculous as Shoot Em Up and yet people only complain about Shoot Em Up.    If you are looking for a great movie that continues to entertain throughout the entire film, this is the movie you should get. If you are looking for a movie with a deep plot or a movie with a dramatic flare to it, look somewhere else. Oh and the soundtrack within the movie is probably the best I've seen/heard in a movie. Shoot Em Up is worth the cash.
B000094HMU|5.0|I bought this DVD because Turandot is my favorite opera and I was not disappointed.  The production at the Met is outstanding - the costumes and sets are gorgeous, and the singing is exquisite, especially Mitchell as Liu.  Her singing absolutely brought me to tears!  I know I will be watching and rewatching it for many years to come.
B0010ZR160|5.0|I can't believe more people didn't see this movie.  It is my personal favorite of 2007.  It's a great movie if you like discussion because the main character makes a huge decision at the end of the movie that is definitely up for debate.  Did he do the right thing?  For me - there's no right answer.      I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes mystery/suspense/crime movies.  And read the book, it's prequels and sequel if you want a good read.  The books are great source material for a great movie.      The acting is great and Ben Affleck really did a great job directing.  He didn't try any tricks to get your attention.  He let the camera capture what was going on in the story.  He let everything speak for itself and let the story unfold as it would.    Definitely worth your money!
B000O176Q6|5.0|I had some pretty high expectations from this movie on blu ray and it went above and beyond when I put the disc in and turned out the lights. I first watched the old theatrical promo to see how it once looked and afterwards when I started the feature I was instantly amazed at how clean everything looked from the jump on blu ray and the sound is probally the best that the 1973 source can deliver into my surround sound speakers. I would recommend this to any fan of the old school martial arts movies and this gives hope to all future kung fu on blu ray. I can't wait to see how the Sister Street Fighters and Killing Machine/Shoguns Ninja will look just waiting on them to arrive from Amazon and will review those also.
B000Y179KO|3.0|This could have been a super album at one CD about 60 minutes long.  Instead they dragged it out to a double that lasts over 90 minutes.  But there is no shortage of great songs, Glenn Frey in particular doesn't have a bad one to speak of, and truly sparkles on this album.  And both Joe Walsh and Timothy B Schmidt contribute a couple of strong tunes each.  Don Henley, the biggest star of the group,  however has had better moments.  Besides Waiting in the Weeds his songs don't match up to some of his best stuff from his solo albums.    Personally I would have preferred a sparser sound, there is way too much production on this album.  The vocal arrangements are tradtional rather than original, and the Eagles, at times, sound closer to a boy band rather than the Eagles.  On Fabulous, that woohoo, after 'a little time in the country' makes me cringe everytime.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|wow!  they did it again, disney, director, and the cast.  all very talented.  we are excited for \\"#3\\".
B000002BBY|5.0|Wow oh wow!  I don't know if my cd shelves will hold out!  lol  Oasis sure surprised me when I popped their cd into my player!  A smile came to my face and heck if someone hadn't glued it there...I couldn't have wiped it off if I'd tried!  lol  I can't believe how much Oasis sounds like The Beatles at times.  Particularly in Don't Look Back In Anger (the opening piano music and how deep the voice of the lead singer is).  However, all of the songs hint at The Beatles' style, not just the one.  I'd have to say my favorite tracks on this album are:  the catchy opener Hello (they made an excellent choice using it as the first track because it just SINKS into you!), Wonderwall (I heard this on the radio.  I love the break in the music!  It just makes the song!), and Don't Look Back In Anger (Like I said...it's that great.)  Other highlights are Champagne Supernova (It makes you feel 'high'...on good feelings, not drugs, you sillies!), and the untitled track #6 which is more of a guitar solo than anything.  You might like this if you like classic rock (like Led Zeppelin or The Beatles...something like that) or if you are into European bands.  This is a great one.  Give it a listen sometime!

In my books you are amazing thanks
0385339089|5.0|John Grisham always seems to present ideas in the most refreshing way. His descriptions of otherwise normal events leave you turning the pages expectantly as if reading a thriller (and this time it is more of a thriller). This novel has the same suspenseful anticipation, whether it is a court room proceeding or a mob hit-mans hunt for \\"the Client\\".<br /><br />The young man involved, Mark, is a totally believable witness caught between the mob and the legal system. His ally in this adventure is Reggie Love (granted her name may be a little much), who has only been a lawyer a short time but who gives everything to \\"the Client\\".<br /><br />Without giving anything away, if you love Grisham you will not be disappointed with this book. Of course, there is the usual legal wrangling and a lawyer as the hero, but the reliable Grisham style and wit also abound here. And he dabbles more in the excitement of a thriller than some of his other legalistic tomes.<br /><br />Sam Hendricks, Author of \\"Fantasy Football Guidebook\\" and \\"Fantasy Football Almanac\\"

B000Y7U98C|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie greatly as I am a fan of Danny Boyle and an even bigger fan of anything that has to do with outer space.  Within the first 5 minutes of the film two incredibly vast plot holes stole all suspension of disbelief I may have been able to muster:  1.  The sun has enough hydrogen to fuel itself for another 5 billion years...WHY is it prematurely dimming only 50 years from now, when the film takes place?  This is NEVER  explained (possibly because its ludicrous to begin with) and,  2.  Why send a manned crew to deliver the payload, thereby placing humans in jeopardy?  The entire voyage seems to be completely pre-calculated and automated and the ship is clearly able to run completely independently of the humans, so WHY SEND THEM?  Again, this is never explained.       I gave this film 2 stars because of the incredible visuals and decent first and second acts, despite the looming avoidance of logic shadowing over the plot.  Then the third act hits and...the final nail is driven into the coffin.  A supernatural humanoid villain suddenly appears for no reason and any attempt at explanation is greatly avoided.  The movie then turns into a preposterous haunted house, killer-on-the-loose fiasco that would be campy if it didn't take itself so seriously.  Throughout this movie, my two primary thoughts were \\"Huh?\\" and \\"Yeah, right!\\"

B0006L16N8|5.0|This was the first Coldplay album that I got into and dissected. A lot of people have claimed this to be overrated. But what I don't think some people get is they kept their same drifting, spacey aura. Every song on this album, IMO, has a different, but warming personality. I didn't get that on every song of Parachutes and Rush of Blood.    \\"Square One\\" is an excellent opener with a catchy beat, the spacey vibe, and Chris Martin's smooth voice. \\"What If\\" is one of my favorite tracks and kicks off with some very melodic and soothing piano. My favorite track on this album is \\"The Hardest Part\\". This track, to me, represented a mini-culmination and collaboration with the piano that was dominant in \\"What If\\" with an uptempo beat like \\"White Shadows\\" and Martins' soon-to-be iconic voice.    Bottom Line: These guys will be considered one of the all-time great bands if they keep up this pace.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I am a huge Yes fan. I am an even bigger Rick Wakeman fan, and he shines on this album. I've been listening to this album for years and only recently picked up the remastered version (Mini LP version just like the real album.)    What a pleasure to here this album so crisp and with the two bonus tracks. As far as I'm concerned, Yes without Rick Wakeman is subpar. Along with his solo album \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\", this is his best work. I am so pleased to see so many others agree!    Go do yourself a favor and pick up this masterpiece!

0307387178|5.0|This is a good story, well written, with appropriate length and digression.  The unstated thing that could help to explain the young man's exceptional path somewhat, is that his life was bracketed by the so-called X-Generation.  I am much older myself, but it is worth considering my observation that McCandless may not have seen avenues to explore many visible options in terms of rewarding societal roles for his type of personality given the snapshot context of his generation.  Things were to open up eventually in later years, but perhaps he was one who just would not be put on hold and was not to march in place in a group formation.  Apart from recommending the story, my purpose in commenting on this is to dilute any guilt that might painfully linger.  The life he lived was meaningful on terms important to the young man, and he would not seem to care to have it restructured by the force of any outside authority, while respecting the same privilege for everyone else.

B000YPUF9W|3.0|I rather enjoyed the first 2 installments of this movie trilogy.  This one, while not bad, still didn't quite live up to the others.  The story was much weaker, and the special effects, for the most part, I found to be over done.  Over all, the character development was lacking.  Unless you want it to complete the collection, I'd wait for it to come out on cable, or just borrow it from a friend.  It's probably worth your time to watch, but I'm not sure if it's worth your money.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride & Prejudice: Two Movies<br /><br />Jane Austen's novel, Pride & Prejudice, is set in rural, early nineteenth century England. It centers around Elizabeth Bennet, the second daughter of five. Though her family lives in what today seems a mansion, and her father is a gentleman, they are considered poor in the society in which they live. Mrs. Bennet seems to think of nothing but having her daughters married to the finest and richest men that she contrives to know of and meet. When two such men (jovial and friendly Mr. Bingly, and distant and proud Mr. Darcy) enter the community, the Bennet household is sent into an uproar of chatter and anticipation. Pride and prejudice on both sides, however, threaten to spoil the blossoming prospects.<br /><br />This adaptation of the classic was made in 1995, by A&E and the BBC, with Colin Firth (as Mr. Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle (as Elizabeth Bennet). In this version, the photography is on a grand scale, with picturesque scenery. Many of the lines leap from the pages of the book, the story and its times are accurately depicted, and the acting is superb. Also not to be forgotten, is the beautiful, sometimes lively, sometimes serene, musical score, which sweeps the viewer into its mood.<br /><br />Taking a more modern approach, the 2005 adaptation casts Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet. It also stars Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg, aunt of Mr. Darcy. The photographic angles in this version were contemporary, as opposed to the traditional drawing room style of the BBC. This version takes much more liberty with the customs and propriety of the times (i.e. characters walking miles through the countryside in their nightclothes, or bursting into rooms with no announcement). All of the actors had big shoes to fill, but Knightly, Macfadyen, and Dench did a good job at casting new, and well-executed light on their characters (where the script allowed for it). Most of the other actors/characters, however, I don't think filled those shoes hardly at all. The costumes, music, and sets in this were all much shabbier than those in the 1995 version (the one on this page). I think this script would be difficult for a newcomer to the story to follow, especially regarding introduction of characters. Also, in trying to make the script different from other versions, the characters simply changed their minds, instead of growing and learning throughout the narrative, and the lessons of the story were lost for the most part.<br /><br />All this said, I prefer the 1995 adaptation, because: it adheres to the story and times; the music, landscape, and costumes are elegant; the acting (in my opinion) is superior.

B000002UD7|4.0|PSB seem to have a knack for coming out with albums that engage you throughout despite critics saying otherwise.  On tracks like \\"It's A Sin\\" or my fave \\"What Have I Done To Deserve This\\" it still feels like i'm hearing the song for the first time even those its been quite awhile.  The song and the rest of the cd feels like something you could and should still enjoy to this day.  A solid effort after the previous album \\"Please\\" and a cool addition to your Pet Shop Boys collection.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|This album is better then then last he made.  I love old Springsteen but I realize you can't live in the past and this is as close to old springsteen in awhile.  No politics.
B000VSBX34|4.0|Having first watched this as a teenager when it was shown as an afternoon movie on a B&W TV in a heavily edited version, I really looked forward to seeing this for \\"the first time\\" as an adult.  I wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />In many ways, it's almost painfully innocent invoking a time when comedy didn't have to make sense or rely on fart jokes as punch lines.  To me, Help! invokes the spirit of my favorite Marx Brothers film, Duck Soup.  The four Beatles, while not as distinctive here as the four Marxes, seem to be having a grand time running around in a crazy not-quite-real world that isn't too far removed from Duck Soup's Freedonia.  The film's logic operates on its own level and that works just fine.<br /><br />The humor--to use a modern term--is \\"politically incorrect,\\" basing the chase for the ring on a quasi Hindu and/or Muslim beliefs as filtered through Western screenwriters and their bag of cliches.  It's dated, but its still funny if you can get past the stereotypes.<br /><br />The film itself plays around with the form, using titles, self-reflexive joking around, and all in all silliness.  The thin plot is like the best of the Marx Brothers, nothing more than a place to hang the jokes and schtick on.  On that level Help! really is a lot of fun, plus all that great Beatles music.<br /><br />The DVD is filled with goodies and the print is fantastic, rich in color.  The short documentary on how the film was restored is well worth watching.

B000XCZGV8|5.0|ZODIAC is director David Fincher's finest film to date.  All of the preparatory exercises in violence and horror he served so well in such films as FIGHT CLUB and SEVEN now are even more terrifying because of the manner in which he internalizes the events of the infamous Zodiac killer of the 1960s and 1970s and allows us to see how the murders and lack of proof of the perpetrator destroyed the personal lives of those bound to reveal Zodiac's identity. The story of course is true, as documented in Robert Graysmith's book (adapted extremely well for the screen by James Vanderbilt), and the history is so well known that rehashing it in a review is pointless.  But on to the production.<br /><br />Filmed in the Bay area the film has that peculiar light known to artists of the region but rarely captured so well as it is here by cinematographer Harris Savides: the sunlight (when visualized is brilliant and the night portions are dank not only form the seeming constant rain but also form the seediness of the story's message. The acting is of the highest caliber: newspaper cartoonist Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal, in a standout role), police inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo, in one of his finest performances), news writer Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.), Melvin Belli (Brian Cox), Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), Graysmith's long-suffering wife Melanie (Chloë Sevigny), down to the more minor roles are all pitch perfect.<br /><br />What makes this film work so well is the emphasis on the human aspect of how violence, especially random and uncontrolled, alters the psyches of people.  The breakdown from the stress of the fruitless and frustrating investigation by each of the primary characters is heart wrenching. How much of this is actor driven by such talented pros and how much is due to Fincher's directorial abilities is probably a moot point. The very long unwinding of this struggle (158 minutes) becomes almost unbearably tense.  While the Added Features of this set open windows of information that delve more deeply into this unsolved horror story, the film still stands solidly on its own without the added accoutrements. This is a very fine film that is worthy of the many awards that are dangling in space at the moment.

B000XPU5NY|3.0|First of all, I was expecting Phil Collins to sound really rough and ragged. But quite the opposite was true -- he sounds smoother than ever. If there's a problem with this, it's that he avoids getting into any rough territory vocally and robs bits of the material of their power. But that's a minor complaint.    I don't have a problem with the songs' keys being changed so Phil doesn't have to hit the high notes. He wasn't hitting those notes anyway on the WAY WE WALK live albums 15 years ago -- he avoided them by messing with the melodies, in ways that didn't always work. I'll take the key changes instead of this, thank you.    Tony Banks uses some distinctly different synth sounds than before. He depends a little too much on what seems to be one particular sound, which works better in some places (Cinema Show, from the In The Cage Medley) than others (Los Endos).    The performances are consistently strong -- a little too slick for a live album, actually, as is typical for Genesis.    Overall, this is not a bad live album at all.  It's just really *unnecessary*. There are NO surprises in the set list. There is NOTHING that hasn't already been covered by previous live albums (if you count ARCHIVE 1976-92). And Genesis is one of those bands that really needs to avoid releasing multiple live versions of the same song, because they always play the same song pretty much the same way. What little sense there is of anything being new or different is added by a few minor variations in how the songs are presented (for example, Duke's End rearranged as Duke's Intro); otherwise, this is pretty much \\"been there done that.\\"
0060934913|4.0|First, let me admit that I love Bourdain's show on the Travel channel.  I especially love the little warning at the beginning of the show advising viewers of harsh language.  It always makes me giggle.  TV should be entertaining - as should be books.    And entertained is how I felt when reading Bourdain's book.  His anecdotes are fun and interesting and often make up for the lack of good style or a composed narrative.  Structurally, the books is sectioned into various topics that range from Bourdain's childhood, his culinary education to food techniques and the running of a restaurant.  Some of these chapters had previously published in various magazines and lend themselves to be read individually and without order.    Bourdain's language - much like you can hear on his TV show - is coarse and vulgar.  His stories are also full of \\"nasty\\" items, people and food products.  But that seems to be his personality and if you want a book that reflect the authors personality, you are well served here (pun intended).    A couple last things to keep in mind:  1. This is not a book about cooking techniques.  2. This is not a book with great recipes.  3. This is not a book for children.  4. This is not a book that teaches you how run a restaurant.  5. This is not a book with restaurant recommendations.    6. This IS a book for the lighthearted and fun.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Based on the mafia involvement of a Russian family in the majestic city of London, Eastern Promises is packed with some strong performances by it's frontline actors. Naomi Watts has proved herself in this particular role. She doesn't look as good as she acts and that's a compliment. The film had just the right amount of tenacity to hold the viewer's interest. There is an action scene in which a man fights like a warrior in the nude. This may not be as good as American Gangster but I can imagine Eastern Promises to win many awards this year. Better than History of Violence and more brutal, Eastern Promises is something you will take seriously. An absolutely vital recommendation for fans of crime/thriller drama genre. Newage Godfather that doesn't seem to try hard at all.

B00012FXAE|5.0|After Ridley Scott directed the first Alien (Which I thought was 'okay'), James Cameron took the wheel. Though he was an action movie director he felt confident that he could do a sequel too the subtle horror movie, and do it he did.    In fact, the result was alot better than than the first one ended up being. There are many differences between the first and second film, I think this is worth taking time to explain.    Where as the first film, sat and waited (maybe a bit too long). Aliens develops the characters and gets on with itself, making sequences long when it needs to, and making things pick up the pace when needed. When sequences are drawn out in this film, it racks up the suspense, making you think that there will be an attack any second. This sequnce is held (brillaintly) for a full fifteen minutes, and let me tell you, it's SCARY.    Also, the effects in this film are much better than in the first, do the Alins look more real? Nope, but the camera angles are used to perfection as tools to make the aliens more realistic. Using quick cut aways, and delicate camrea angles, Cameron makes the Aliens convincing, and scary.    The characters involved in the film are brilliant also, all of them are different, and memorable, you don't have to watch the film 5 times and look at wikipedia over and over to know who each character is, the make themselves known just by being, well, themselves.    Almost everything in the film is perfect, and is definitely a must-see for sci-fi, horror and action fans.    9/10 stars

A father of three son's step's down as Great Lord to leave his oldest son with the title of Great Lord, another brother is shunned for his discontent with his father's decision, while the other brother secretly plan's his takeover of the throne. It's very sad how greed and deciept take over this family as the bloody war's breakout, with scene's that make most Hollywood movie's pale in comparison. This is a beatifully directed film with great performances, gory battle's, gorgeous landscapes, and a great story. Highly Recommended.

0375842381|5.0|These three books are amazingly well written. In inventiveness, language structure, and vocabulary they outclass the Hogwarts' tales a hundredfold or more. The characters are very well drawn, dynamic, and even highly un-likeable in moments, like real people.     This is true Literature in the classic sense of the word, educated writing for intelligent readers, not just thematically but creatively as well. It is meant to challenge and entertain within a fictional world(s).    However, without giving away anything, I must say that no one \\"kills god\\" in any of the books. If you read that comment in any review, it simply means the reviewer is puppetting secondhand information without even bothering to educate themselves first with the literature....much in the same way that most Americans treat religion, unchallenged faith without thought or education. And contrary to popular belief, ill-informed opinions based on hearsay are ultimately empty and carry no merit. This particular story is much more complex than some alleged assignation plot against god.     (Incidentally, there is another book which contains a storyline about the overthrow of god, it's called \\"The Bible\\" and it isn't nearly as well written.)    I would urge you either to read these books or read something else that interests you, but reading is imperative to understanding or challenging opinion.

B0000046KM|5.0|This is the finest production of ballads I have ever heard. It is Shirley Horn's finest recording and I believe one of the finest records ever. The simplicity yet the richness of the sounds are shear magic. The delicate balance between Shirley Horn's piano, her trio and the orchestra is unparalleled in my hearing. None of them over plays the other. This is a very special collaboration indeed.

B00008EYA5|3.0|This a better film than what most people will lead you to believe although not spectacular it is very entertaining in its own right. Has some subpar acting and a weak dialouge, but if you like action and colin farell then you should see it.
B000P0I4O4|2.0|Despite the two terrific actors involved, Morgan Freeman and John Cusack, and Director, twice Oscar-nominated Bruce Beresford, \\"The Contract\\" misses every opportunity to be a great thriller or a moving drama because of its poorly-written script and boring action sequences. This is a kind of B action film in which a sniper tries to kill his target, but the target is saved by a pure luck more than once; in which the film's situation is incredibly contrived, but its weak story offers little except clichéd and uninteresting characters walking and talking.    Morgan Freeman is Frank, military-trained assassin in the custody of US marshals. He manages to escape with a help from contract killers, but is then apprehended by Ray, an ex-policeman played by John Cusack. Ray and Ray's son wander in the woods with Frank in handcuffs, trying to contact the police and turn in the hitman while protecting his son, but criminals are hot on the trail of them.    The story revolves around the three characters, but it gives no chance to show what these actors can do as it shows little character development. Actions (including shootings, a helicopter and a little bit of car crash) are too bland to interest us. The characters both the good and the bad behave illogically, always doing the last thing they should do and there are plenty of plot holes that would make you feel: \\"Why do they have to do this?\\" or \\"Why don't they just do that?\\"
B000056N8X|3.0|\\"There can be only one!\\"    Is the catch phrase for \\"Highlander\\" saga. The original movie seemed to have concluded the story. When the producers realized maybe they were hasty in concluding the story they decided to breath life into two  god-awful sequels then developed the series. At first I was resistant  to the series however, after catching a couple of episodes my interest was  changed from curiousity to be the thrid season to ardent fan. However,  I felt that Connor Macleod was always the \\"true Highlander\\" but you cannot  ignore the market. While attending a \\"Clan convention\\" in 1997 I was trhe only attendee to wear something to do with Conor Macleod. Endgame had some good points and some not so good points.    Had they released the \\"Director's Edition\\" in the thearters the movie would have done a better box office.
B000YAFJYS|5.0|Every once in a while a great revelation comes in cinema... and we have one here!    Based on the graphic novels [[ASIN:0375714839 The Complete Persepolis]] by Marjane Satrapi, this 90 minute film is a superb translation of the original source material. The heavily stylized black and white cartoon is very powerful yet remains simple in it's universal emotional core. The charming little girl we are introduced slowly grows up to be a defiant woman in a place that is not for her. As we go along with the journey characters come and go, but the threat of Marjane's story never becomes weak, every plot point makes an impact. The melancholy score and spirited rendition of Eye of the Tiger add a wonderful layer to the whole experience.     This film is a breath of fresh air in this cynical age of high concept mega tent-pole films. For Iranians, it's a bittersweet journey home, and for Americans... a great chance to see that Iranians are not the monsters portrayed in the never ending game of politico.     A magnificent black and white film for an era of oh so gray problems.
0316113506|5.0|Having ready 2 previous books by John : The users guide to brain and Driven  by distraction i was looking forward to reading SPARK. I was especially  interested in learning how John was going to tie exercise with the brain  functioning since i am a strong supporter of exercise and have experienced  its benefits. I knew before reading SPARK that exercise in some way does  make you feel better. But SPARK puts it in perspective from a scientific  point of view. The chapters on Stress and depression particularly caught my  attention since most of us struggle with these 2 issues at some point in  life and again most of us turn to popping a pill to deal with it. If its as  simple as getting on a treadmill or a bike and working out for 30-45  minutes without any side effects, then it seems only logical to do it. The  BDNF (Miracle-gro as John calls it) was a very interesting read for me. I  did had to go back and re-read certain topics as was it too much medical  terms to comprehend in one read. But once i got it, it became permanent and  that's the beauty of this book.   Its simple yet powerful in its message. The simplicity comes from the fact  that \\"you goto workout \\". The power comes from the facts / data that proves  \\"why you goto workout\\". Once the reader ties the two together, the message  is very clear and hopefully will remain for a lifetime with the reader.  Today if you look around there is a lot of awareness among people about the  ill-effects of obesity. There are TV programs, advertisements, books about  why exercising is good for you and how it will help you be more fit. But  this is the only books that tells you that exercise will also make your  brain fit along with your body. The brain-body connection is important and  one cannot be ignored over the other.
B000002J6F|5.0|OK we all know the roots of this album, Buffalo Springfield-BYRDS-etc. The family tree of California Rock/Country Rock etc. This stop along the way is fantastic. With Manassas we have a musical journey/book.  When I bought this album in \\"72\\" I was so amazed, like a kid in a musical candy store. Then Manassas came to town, I told my freinds were going to see Stephen Stills & Manassas. They were like Who's that what's a Manassas. I explained who they were a little history about Stephen & Chris, where the name Manassas came from (Manassas Virginia where the famous battles were fought during the Civil War). All's I can say is they were blowen away, so was I. If I could see one concert over again it would be Manassas. Now about the album being to long-HOG WASH. You might as well take a classic novel and rip 3 or 4 chapters out. To me its a musical journey that showcase's many styles of music. At least all the style's I love Rock, Blues & Country. Its a tough decision but one of my favorite songs is \\"So Begins The Task\\". Now its been about 36 years since Manassas was first released. I would love to see a box set with \\"Down the Road\\" remastered- unreleased songs alt-takes and some Live recordings from the tours. (PLEASE)  PS Get this Album, Just Do It
0446691437|5.0|Awsome book.    The best book I have ever read.    Do yourself a favor and buy the audio book online.  It is available for mp3 download.   Pressfield, the author narrates this book, it is great.    I LOVE THIS BOOK.
B000063V8S|4.0|I haven't actually started watching this season yet- my trek nerd fiance and I are still in season 3.  He has said numerous times that seasons 3 and 4 are the best, and so far season 3 is much better than 1 and 2 were, so I suspect this will be accurate... Anyway, if you already have the first 3 seasons, you should buy this one to complete the collection, it would look funny to have seasons 1-3 and 5-7 but not 4, you know? :)
B000A2XC1C|2.0|I thought the sound quality was poor.  I had to turn it way up to be able to hear the voices but it made the background noises too loud.
B000P0J02E|5.0|After seeing the movie, we wanted the soundtrack because we thought the music score was great. Ordered the CD, received it in a timely manner and was pleased with the service.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I really can't write a long review on this one because In Rainbows is such a monumental achievement in my eyes that I find few words that truly express how I feel about it.  It's the only album that matters to me right now and I haven't felt that way about a Radiohead release since OK Computer.  I've loved the albums in between but none satisified me so completely as In Rainbows has.  Being an agnostic, music is the closest to being religious as I get and so, for me, this album feels like the soundtrack to someone's soul if one exists.<br /><br />I've always been objective on people's opinions regarding music but in this instance I truly feel like the those who don't like this album either didn't give it enough time to sink in or were never fans in the first place.  It stands shoulder to shoulder with OK Computer in my book and might even be better though I probably shouldn't say that while still so enraptured with it.  The bottom line is that this album has space.  Each song is allowed to have its own flow and it does take several listens to fully embrace every track.  Don't put in on while driving or reading a book, it demands your full attention and would be honored if you threw on the headphones while your at it.<br /><br />We don't live in an age of unlimited attention spans so I can see why many would lose patience with it.  Even the Amazon review called it a bit lethargic but I never heard anyone say the same thing about Pink Floyd even though they rarely rose above 30 bpm.  In Rainbows contains a full spectrum of sound and even manages to rock out pretty hard in places.  I'm not going to analyze each song because I keep finding different reasons why I like them with every listen.  Anything I say may be the exact opposite reason why someone else digs the same track.<br /><br />Key songs for me are Bodysnatchers, Weird Fishes/Arpeggi, All I Need and Reckoner.  Although I will note that what stands out the most for me on this album for some reason is the drumming by Phil Selway.  At first listen he almost seemed buried in the mix but slowly but surely I felt his work was the subdued lynch pin of the whole album.  He truly deserves as much credit as possible for the beautiful work he has turned in.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the packaging is a bit unwieldy so be careful opening it.  I'm not going to ding it one star because of this fact as another reviewer did because in the end the music is what should really be judged hear and five stars doesn't seem like enough.  Oh look, I guess I was able to find the words to express how I felt about this record.  Silly me for making such bold commitment in the beginning.At first listen he almost seemed buried in the mix but slowly but surely I felt his work was the subdued lynch pin of the whole album.

6304711905|5.0|Without a doubt my favorite movie, and not just in westerns, but all genres.<br /><br />The only info I wanted to add, was to advise people to make sure they buy the DVD that comes in the black packaging, and not the DVD titled Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series) (1993).<br /><br />The latter (The Director's Cut) adds deleted scenes back into the movie, and gives the movie a whole new feel, which is definitely not a better feel, to say the least.  They were deleted for a reason, and it should have stayed that way.  To add, The Director's Cut doesn't even include the theatrical version as an option, so you're stuck with a DVD you'll probably never use again.<br /><br />What's unfortunate, is the former (black packaging) does not come with these deleted scenes as bonus material, but you're not missing anything.

B000U7169M|2.0|The Reaping, starring Hilary Swank was interesting for a variety of reasons. Of course there was nothing terribly original. The plot involved biblical plagues, a child believed to be responsible for the strange happenings being reported, strange deaths and a disbeliever. I, on the other hand, looked at it from the perspective of \\"How would I react following a situation that rocked my spiritual beliefs to it's very foundation\\"? \\"How would I view God or my spirituality following a tragedy that rocked me to my core\\"? Or \\"How much can a person take before they break\\"?     While the story revolves a Louisiana State University scientist who heads to the bayou to investigate reported biblical plagues. Water is turning to blood, frogs falling from the sky, lotus covering everything following the death of a young boy at the hands of his sister. As the story unravels, we find out that there is more to this small town that meets the eye.
B0004Z33EQ|3.0|While I have never seen that many of his movies, there is a certain something about Mr Sylvester Stallone. A strange appeal, which will lead to me confessing my crush on him soon - ooops. THEN, not now. Now, he looks like his mother. There's something quite sad in his eyes occasionally, it just makes you want to mother him. That's my embarrassing crush.<br /><br />With the new Rambo movie coming out, the latest Rocky movie already out, obviously it's time to revisit some older Sly movies. Just to compare. I wouldn't pick his movies straight away to watch, but maybe in future, I might start doing that. While they're not mind numbingly boring, they also don't require you to switch your brain on. Always a plus point for me. AND James Cameron AND Sly wrote the screenplay for this. While there wasn't many lines for Sly, he does briefly fall for a girl, and then go on the rampage. Oh, and go against orders. What more could you expect from a Sly movie?<br /><br />The storyline basically goes like this: Sly is removed from prison (or some kind of prison camp) to go on a mission, to discover if there are still are American POWs left in Vietnam. He's to take photos, and return with the evidence. Just leave them there. Of course we know he won't.<br /><br />But it's so much more than an action movie. I was actually shocked at some points - particularly where Rambo gets double crossed and left for dead - and there are quite a few twists and turns, and a certain segment of the film will bring a tear to those without a stone heart.<br /><br />I'm actually quite looking forward to the new Rambo movie now. I did enjoy the latest Rocky movie, and it will be interesting to see if Sly can come back and still be good as Rambo as he was back then. I'm sure he can. Should be an interesting movie to see anyway.
B000FC10MU|5.0|All I can say is that I truly loved this book.  I picked up and could not put it down.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|If you like movies that are funny then this is for you!  Lots of laughs will be had with this one.  If you into dry humor and indie films this is a definate must see.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|This is music to relax and enjoy when you are in love. You also can enjoy yourself if you are having a dinner party. No one can predict what will happen when you first here her sing. Why have you not ordered it yet Order this CD from Amazon,of course.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Superb quality for a true classic Sci-Fi. This is a work of genius and it was wonderful to see it in all its brilliance after so many years.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I've waited a few years before saying this, but am now pretty sure that this album is my all time favourite from any artist. When I first heard this cd I could hardly believe how brilliant it was...I just kept on playing it...and I've never gotten sick of it. Although this cd should come with a warning for people new to Ryan Adams music: IF YOU BUY THIS, YOU'll END UP BUYING EVERYTHING HE'S EVER RECORDED, INCLUDING WITH WHISKEYTOWN. That's alot of cd's! But well worth it...2005 was an expensive year to be a Ryan Adam fan (with three releases). I feel \\"privileged\\" to be the owner of no. 995 of 1,000 of the colored vinyl Gold promo record - even if it cost me nearly $400.00 on eBay (haha, see what I mean). One day Ryan will top this album, some say Heartbreaker is his best so far (his first solo album). I prefer Gold just a bit more - but I'm just waiting for a better album (or equal) to this from Ryan. I'm sure he can do it - he almost achieved it with Easy Tiger. In the meantime though, thank you Winona Ryder!!! Without you, this album may never have existed - wow, I wonder how she must feel being the muse to this incredible masterwork. I wouldn't claim that Ryan (David) Adams is a genius...but I know that he's a musical genius, the proof is in listening to this.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a great read.  It kept me turning the pages but also allowed me insight into other religous and political mindsets without me even realizing (i.e., without being boring).
B000286S8S|3.0|The order of the tracks completely ruins this album for me.  It should be arranged in roughly chronological order or at least separated by lead singer.  The three new tracks are not very good and this is made worse by placing them as tracks 2-4.  The selection of songs is not so bad otherwise, although the live versions with Hagar performing a few of Roth's hits are a largely a throw-away as far as I'm concerned.    I only bought this version because of the fact that it includes everything on Best of Van Halen, Vol. 1.  I intend to separate the tracks myself and burn one CD for Sammy Hagar and one for David Lee Roth.  The original CDs will sit unused on the shelf.
0446619078|5.0|\\"Everybody counts or nobody counts\\" is the mantra that Harry Bosch attempts to live by in this novel, and it almost costs him his job and his life.  While on forced leave from the LAPD, Bosch takes up the years old case of the death of his mother.  His investigation creates more tremors in the LAPD and the city than the recent earthquake that has destroyed his house.  Connelly offers great writing and a great story hear.  Bosch's sessions with a therapist reveal some of the inner workings of the investigator who identifies with what may be the last coyote in the hills near his home.  This is one of the best from Connelly.
0446577391|5.0|I love this series about a group of hard luck misfits (named the Camel Club) in the nations capital who somehow came together to explore Washingtonian conspiracies. Mr Baldacci apparently has a wandering mind and let the group age for a time while he pursued another line of writing. Fans clamored for more of the august adventures of the Camel Club, the wait proved to be very worthwhile.<br />This one takes up where the last adventure left off and quickly slips into a higher gear. I couldn't put it down. Truly menacing bad guys, one of which turns out to be different than you had thought. A riveting roller coaster ride of high adventure and suspense.<br />I was going to say a lot more then realized that it might serve to spoil the book. I have read most of David Baldacci's books, this one rates as possibly the best.
0740748475|5.0|Anyone who appreciates the comic strip, appreciates what Bill Watterson brought to this art form.  Neatly bound into three (very heavy) volumes, this is simply all ten years of Calvin and Hobbes, in chronological order.  No more tattered paperbacks of various sizes and styles floating around your house, this is all of them in one place.  It is a joy to read these strips and to watch the characters be introduced and developed.  As the strip moves along, Watterson stretches the rigid confines of the form and his genius becomes apparent.  (If you can't see this for yourself or if you like to have your impressions confirmed by others, see the Publisher's Weekly review by Art Spiegleman.)  If you have room in your budget, and on your shelf, I highly recommend this set.
B000VR824S|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband for Christmas, it was all sold out around here( Illinois ), so he had to wait to receive it. When he did get it and we watched it....amazing....the second disc is better than the first, but all in all, great! Clapton, Nelson, River, just to name a few....like fine wines, aged to perfection....just enjoy the music...
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Anything with \\"Celtic Woman\\" is excellent.  Writing a few words does not do it justice.  It was fabulous.  If you ever have a chance, please see them perform or the next best thing-listen and watch the DVD...you wil not be disappointed.  Sample a track and you will be hooked, I promise.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Let's keep it simple, they have had many CDs, classic songs - well this CD IS A DIAMOND.  The most precious gem, just sit back and listen.  Textures, harmonies, atmosphere, introspection, lifting.  Thom Yorke has never sounded so vital and alive.  Musicianship superb.  Perfection.  In Rainbows.  A complete artistic achievement and triumph.  A+++  No more need be said.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|This is probably Madonna's most Popular and well known Album.   Out of all of her 80's Albums its not my Favourite Album, \\"Like A Prayer is, after that \\"True Blue\\" is my fave, and Behind that is \\"Madonna\\" her debuet, and since \\"Into The Groove\\" isnt on this CD it looses a star. But this is a fun pop Album. My Favourite songs are \\"Material Girl\\" \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Angel\\" and \\"Dress You Up\\". ( Basically the singles ). I also like \\"Stay\\", but I feel like the other tracks \\"Over and Over\\", \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\", and \\"Pretender\\" are basically filler, even though fun. Out of the filler tracks \\"LDLHA\\" IS My fave as it was Madonna's first attempt at a Epic Ballad, though they would get much better on her next album like \\"Live To Tell\\". Two bonus tracks are included however. They are extended remixes of \\"Like A Virgin\\", and \\"Material Girl\\" remixed by the Albums producer John Jellybean Benitez. This is a Definitive MTV Album, and also a Definitive Pop Culture Album. This is for Madonna, what \\"Thriller\\" was for Michael Jackson....Of course the flashy video's for the Title track , and For \\"Material Girl\\" ( Who could forget Madonna as Marilyn Monroe in that Pink Dress ) and 1984 MTV Video Music Awards Performance of Like A Virgin helped. They were Defining moments in Pop Culture, and this Album deserves it's place in Pop Culture. It just sucks that \\"Into The Groove\\" wasn't included on this Remastered Warner Bros release like it was on the 1985 Re Release. It would have also been nice is \\"Crazy For You\\" was on here too. Overall the Sound Quality is Excellent. The Album is worth the Money for the Iconic Cover Alone.
B0009WFDR4|5.0|With all the changes happening in music in the late '60's this classic was a BIG hit in the U.K. but for a variety of reasons(they liked to be in the studio as opposed to touring, label on verge of bankruptcy) it got buried in the U.S. Great songs, Steve Marriott just before he left to help form Humble Pie with Peter Frampton as the next super group. This release was on the level of some of the great entries in the psychedelic period(Sgt. Pepper, Moby Grape, Cream, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix,). The story line on side 2 is great, in conjunction with some really great songs. Side 1 is no slouch. You miss it, your loss. I re-bought it in every format it's ever been released in...............now they remix it.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho starring Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins is a black and white masterpiece to say the least. Great peformances, fantastic direction, and a bone-tingling plot, Psycho is one film not to be missed. This film still gives me goosebumps, probably seen it 50 times and each time I watch it I see something I never noticed before. I highly recommend this \\"mother\\" of a movie, enjoy!
B000TX7B5U|5.0|This is the direction the last couple SOAD albums should have taken. I can see why Serj wanted to do a solo project. Brilliantly done. Some excellent songs with the same message that needs to be heard we've all come to know. The only thing that would make it better is if the tour comes to my town. Cheers!
0061150142|5.0|This book drew me in and you could see there would be some defining stories about Emily. I felt close to her. I had felt what she felt about the sex.Not always what you exspect and when it's over it brings on such a reaction they you can't stand the thought of it. Cris was always after sex but she felt he was like a brother. Then to get pregnant, no choice of her own, I totally blaim Cris. The worst part for me was when he was put in jail. I have agrophobia and the descriptions of what he felt, the smell, being locked up. I almost put the book down. I didn't and I was glad, it was excelent in every way. I really see why Emily thought she had no choice but get out of Cris' control. Their parents were silly and of cource they thought there children were better than all children ever born.I'm working down the list of her books.
0060578793|5.0|Excellent resource, and easy to read. However, I wonder who \\"proofread\\" this book...<br />It's full of simple mistakes that most any word processor software would pick up on. That's really my only complaint. It gets 5 stars for its content and readability. It is quite a matter of factly written book, which is something I for one appreciate in a book of this nature. It gets to the point and doesn't beat around the bush (ha).<br />Plant pictures are good, animal tracks are good enough to do the job and the cooking instructions for animals and plants are invaluable.<br />It covers an awful lot of territory, but it does it in a concise and understandable manner. If another author had taken on the challenge, the reader would probably end up overwhelmed. Lofty did a good job. It just doesn't look like he used spellcheck (I know he's a Brit, and Brit spellings aren't what I'm talking about).<br />I'd reccomdend it over the US Army book, unless you dig poor readability. Besides, the US Army book ought to be free for US (taxpaying) Citizens. They should hand it out right next to Guideon Bibles .
B00005JPTI|4.0|Disappointing but not entirely invalid film follows Will Smith as a lone virologist named Robert Neville in a post-bacterial holocaust New York City in which he is the only one able to become the savior for what remains of the human race--the &#34;living&#34; are now called &#34;dark seekers&#34;, mutated, rabies-infected fiends who go on the prowl for blood at night, and of course their &#34;attacker&#34;, Mister Neville. What follows is half-brilliant and half-delusional filmmaking, but all in all it is an entertaining ride and not as bad (in context) as come of its harshest critics have noted. What strikes a viewer most strongly is how much this post-9/11 allegory feels in terms of its heavy-handed spirit of loss; Smith's Neville is a far cry from the one in the Richard Matheson story, but that is/was a different story altogether so we can't use that as a measuring rod of this film's impact. Smith's Neville is not a loner by nature, and he genuinely feels like he is a part of the human race--in this film, it's a tragedy to lose the human population, separate from the feeling offered by the novel that bears this title. Also, there is a much more Evangelical Christian feel to the ending, a sense that humanity will always have a savior that is willing to sacrifice himself for humanity. I can see why a great deal of critics found this intolerable at the time, but in hindsight it's actually a more interesting picture to think about. The CGI &#34;infected&#34; creatures are actually terrible, both in conception and in their comic book-style execution, but it is Smith's rather intense performance that anchors the film instead. Some seemed to find the picture scary in many ways, but it is certainly lightweight in that area (at least for those who watch horror films) and it doesn't have the kind of harsh, misanthropic tone that most effective horror movies command. I seriously felt that director Francis Lawrence desired to make a mournful commentary upon the September 11th attacks, and he made the most of what was left over from the Ridley Scott/Mark Protosevich abandoned film that was never made (see the excellent book by David Hughes about the Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made). This feeling of mourning is aided much by James Newton Howard's light piano score. In short, &#34;I Am Legend&#34; is a Will Smith vehicle, and it is not a horror film really, which is why so many were upset by its &#34;adaptation.&#34; But, for what it is, I enjoyed much that the picture had to offer--there is a great set piece that was kept from the original script that Scott was going to do, and that is when Smith chases his dog into the dark building where some nasty dark seekers await--this scene is genuinely suspenseful. So with all of the heavy spirit of Matheson's ideas bled out from this story, it is a lot more optimistic (or &#34;post-apocaloptimistic&#34;) than a genuine vampire story would have been, looking as if all the heaviness in heart had been taken out and replaced with a kind of tragic accident story (I at first thought it was insulting to suggest that finding a cure for cancer would be a BAD thing, but this idea is never fully explained in the movie, so it's quite a put on really). The film is also simple in mind at points--Smith's character, for instance, listens to Bob Marley and quotes a populist singer, unlike Charlton Heston in &#34;The Omega Man&#34;, who quoted the dreary-minded and sexually deprived T. S. Eliot as a method of describing the remains of the human condition. And, I do vote for the Alternate Ending as being far better than the ridiculous one that was released into theaters--gosh that was silly. But the concept itself--and certainly the first half, as other critics have pointed out--is more involving than most other sf pictures have been as of late. Although somewhat disguised as an action movie, it becomes quite clear early on that &#34;I Am Legend&#34; is a drama film, ignoring an exploration of the pleasures of isolation by putting Smith's character on the breaking point as someone who cannot survive very well without eventual human contact. Interestingly enough, I may be interested in seeing what a studio makes out of Gary Graham's &#34;A Garden at the End of the World&#34; script (picked up from the Black List website/organization) if they so move to turn that script into a prequel to this movie. Warner Brothers's two disc set understandably avoids giving any background to the years-in-production development process of &#34;I Am Legend&#34; from its early conceptual stages. What remains is an examination of the making of this movie, which is okay but offers nothing terribly revealing. The brief extra about the research done into the biology of what could occur during a plague outbreak in today's age is the most interesting feature, and certainly not in depth in any way. The audio commentary track (by Goldsman and director Lawrence) is nothing special at all. This one is mainly for Will Smith fans and people who still need more healing after the 9/11 tragedy, but visually (which is to say, cinematically) it offers a few interesting ideas. B-
B00104W8T6|5.0|This soundtrack is pretty sweet. If you've seen the movie, you have to buy the soundtrack. And the fact that they added a rip of the last scene of the movie makes it extra special. Previous reviews dub Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches as folk acts, but they're actually considered anti-folk. The difference between anti-folk and folk, I don't know, but if either is found on this album, then it's great.<br /><br />Just get it, and if you don't like it, then give it to somebody who loved the movie. They'll make out with you for it. But don't let it go too far or you'll end up like Juno and Bleeker... which might not be such a bad thing.
0143038419|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love is a great read. Elizabeth's journey from suburban 'shoulds' to freedom is inspiring and gratifying. Her journey from tears to joy will give you hope for your own journey. There are some parts of the book that lack the punch of other parts, but whose life is pow, pow, pow all the time? This book is really worth investing your time in. I hope, like me, you'll come away from it thinking more deeply about life, choices and the courage that true freedom requires.
B000VI70WM|1.0|I've been a Duran fan since 1984 (Arena) and I have to say, this album is terrible. Usually what I do is: I put the CD in my car stereo and listen to it while I drive on a parkway. With Astronaut, the first song that caught my ear was \\"Bedroom Toys\\". What about Red Carpet Massacre? None. I think the problem is that the guys decided to get \\"back on the charts\\" (assuming that that is something good these days, with the charts packed with rappers and other \\"cookie-cutter artists\\" with subpar talent) without even considering their loyal fan base. Where are the guitars (Warren's or Andy's, I don't care!). Why do you have a real drummer like Roger if you are just go ahead and drown the \\"Duran Duran sound\\" with blinks and bumps? Let me put it to you this way: if I wanted to HEAR Timbacrap, I would BUY (gasp!) Timbacrap. If I want to listen to Justin Timberlake, I would also buy Timbacrap. I think it's time for Simon and the boys to stop worrying about the charts and think about what their true fans will enjoy. Hell, I even enjoy \\"Pop Trash\\" more than Red Carpet Massacre!
0307275639|5.0|This was such a wonderful read.  It really brings you to a place of thinking about where I am in my life.  I am so amazed at this mans strength.  I hope I have one tenth of a percent of his when  I am struggling.  It was excellent.
1582701709|5.0|I really, really enjoy this book..I say enjoy & not 'enjoyed' because, after reading it through, I find myself, for some unknown reason, reading a few pages a day.  I am still awaiting the DVD and am looking forward to it. Of course there are skeptics about this; aren't there always? and it does review or rehash older philosphies, but SO WHAT!! this is in a better format than some of the other things I've read over the years. I will give one example; not earth-shattering, but one that kind of surprised me...I asked to become more moderate in my spending habits, (no credit card debt, but getting a little too close!!) and after a few days I noticed that while internet shopping, I just didn't 'have to have' that certain item.I can hear the laughter now..big deal, you say? well, to me it is; after trying will power (which never works, by the way) this did it for me. There'll be other things I ask for, but wanted to start with something small. And the parking spot idea? works just about every time; hey,nothing's perfect!! So get this book or dvd or cd set and see what it can do for you. The people who complain that it's all about getting 'things' probably have that as THEIR own fault; don't blame the book!!!!!!
075640407X|3.0|So I bought this book after hearing all the wonderful reviews it was getting. The last two times I took a chance on a novel I read Brandon Sanderson's \\"Elantris\\" and Scott Lynch's \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" Both of those books were amazing and kept me turning pages until the end. Third time's the charm, right? Nope.    From the dust jacket we know that Kvothe (pronounced nearly the same as \\"quothe\\", as we are told about one hundred and seventeen times before the book is over) is a legend. Depending on which story you believe, he is either the world's greatest assassin, greatest musician, greatest wizard, or the sexiest man to be bestowed upon the female gender. But he's given all that up to live a simple life as an innkeeper.     The story starts in the third person where Kote's (as he calls himself now) peaceful business is interrupted by a spider-like demon attacking the town. Then we meet Chronicler, a famous, you got it, chronicler of historical events. Kote agrees to tell him his true life story to set all the rumors and lies about him straight.     Now, up until now I was interested. The spider-demons had my attention and so did the war going on in another part of the land. But instead Rothfuss takes us back some 20-25 years ago to when Kovthe was a boy.     What follows is a dreadfully slow re-telling (in the first person) of his life. This is where all the fantasy cliches come in: (spoilers below)    - Murdered family (check)  - Orphaned (check)  - Smarter, wiser, clever, and better fighter than anyone (check)  - Doing it all before puberty (check)    The story only picks up again when Kvothe fanagles his way into Hogwarts...oh, excuse me, \\"The University\\" and begins learning magic. There's also the Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy clones lying in wait and his two best buddies he meets shortly after enrolling.     The events at The University takes up most of this novel. We watch Kvothe learn magic, impress his teachers, and become the darling of the school.Along the way he explores the nearby town and gets himself into a bit of trouble.     About 100 pages before it ends Kvothe has the big confrontation. But it isn't with who you think. It's with a character that just appeared about 50 pages before out of the blue. Honestly, nothing exciting.     When it is over, nothing is resolved. The events in the present from the beginning of the book are never addressed again, the villain from the start of Kvothe's flashback is never seen again, and none of the sub-plots at the school are resolved. It's like the editors just decided to stop right there.     I know I've ranted a lot but this book does have a few good things:    Not often do we see an emphasis on currency. Rothfuss created a viable currency system and Kvothe often goes into detail about the state of his finanaces.     The magic system is original. \\"Sympathy\\" is well realized and used accordingly.     Rothfuss has a profound vocabulary and doesn't mind beating you over the head with it. While Goodkind may bludgeon you with speeches and Jordan pulverizes you with every minute detail of a character's clothes, Rothfuss will teach you a few new words for you lexicon.     But, there isn't enough here to justify the price. It's not a *bad* book per se, it's just...not that good. Wait for the paperback if you really want to read it. Hopefully book two will close some of the dangling plot lines and show us more of the present.

1593082037|5.0|This is great book.  My 13 years daughter loves it and read it multiple times.
0743201140|5.0|The idea of the book is to help you find your talents, build your strengths, which will in turn, improve your performance.     Building your strengths is indeed somthing that is often overlooked, as most of the time we seek to improve our weaknesses- that's a point well taken- and a good reason to buy the book. However two more things also need to be mentioned. First, why can't we work on building both our strengths AND our weaknesses? In other words, why do we have to necessarily pick just one? I feel that many weaknesses can be improved upon.    Secondly, discovering your talents and doing what you're good at may not necessarily improve your performance. Why? Because there are lots of things we're good at, but still hate to do nonetheless. For instance, I'm really good at cleaning houses and debating, but I don't like to really do either one. People really perform well when its something that they know how to do AND when there's something meaningful/important in it for them. Anyway, just some food for thought.

B00095MLGC|5.0|Here we have the first Porcupine Tree to feature contributions from keyboard player Richard Barbieri and bassist Colin Edwin.  Both would eventually become full time members of the band.  Here they appear on one track each.  Actually Barbieri also participated in \\"Phase 4\\" of the previous disc \\"Voyage 34\\" as well.  To me this is the first truly great 5 star album from Porcupine Tree.  Stephen Wilson has a clear idea of what he wants to get across with no filler to be found.  The album is about 75% instrumental with Wilson's dreamy vocals weaving their way into the material here and there.  The album somewhat continues the LSD tripping theme of \\"Voyage 34\\" especially the first few tracks that feature more voiceovers similar to the previous disc.  Some great songs are to be found here including \\"Synesthesia\\", \\"Not Beautiful Anymore\\", \\"Up The Downstair\\", and \\"Fadeway\\".  If you are a more recent convert to Porcupine Tree and have never explored the early stuff this album is a must pick up.

B0002N4ZEW|4.0|In a nutshell this album is an hour long musical journey through an acid trip.  The album is all instrumental with the exception of quite a few voice over¡¦s from old 1960¡¦s LSD documentaries, and acid tripping participants.  60¡¦s acid guru Timothy Leary is featured as well.  There is a definite Pink Floyd influence to all of this, especially the main theme which is very similar to ¡§Another Brick In The Wall¡¨ from ¡§The Wall¡¨ album.  This is another disc that was created prior to Porcupine Tree actually becoming a band.  Stephen Wilson is the sole contributor to the music on phase 1, 2 and 3 of the disc, and that in itself is pretty amazing.   Some Porcupine Tree fans really dislike this album while others hail it as an early triumph.  I think you have to take it for what it is, but for the most part I have always really liked it.  Listening to the album with the aid of inebriating substances can definitely enhance the experience (I admit to nothing º), but I have also always enjoyed the disc straight up as well.

It's just another part of the adventure which is never dull, often rich and striking to the eye, and definately satisfying in the conclusion.  Highly recommend this film.

B000XA5K4I|4.0|\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is an over-the-top action movie that starts off with a bang and doesn't slow down until the final credits roll seventy nine minutes later.  This is actually a live action version of a Bugs Bunny cartoon with Clive Owen in the role of the wascally wabbit and Paul Giamatti as Elmer Fudd.      The plot is..well, that's incidental.  What matters in this movie is that bullets are constantly flying and the body count is constantly rising.  If the movie seems silly and overblown it's supposed to be.  This is pretty much a parody of one of those silly action movies you might have seen Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger back in the eighties and nineties.  I realize this movie probably won't be for everyone (including those who don't like characters with necrophilia tendencies) but for those who just want to put there brain on hold for a little while you will probably have fun.    By the way, this movie has a pretty good soundtrack featuring songs from Nirvana, Wolfmother, AC/DC, Motley Crue, and others.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney Spears?<br />Great Dance Pop CD.  Unique sounds.  New Dance Techno whateva U wanna call it.  Don't judge the CD because it says Britney Spears...judge it for the music.<br />I like music videos but just imagine back in time when videos weren't as fluent as they are now.  We mostly only heard the music and didn't see the performer or even knew much about them except that they produced good music.  Just my opinion.  Be your own judge.  I love the CD!!!!!!!<br />Laurence from Red Bay, AL.
B00006G8K0|4.0|I have always been a classic Universal horror films fan and was never that big a fan of the Hammer interpretations. This was because of my loyal devotion to the original classic Universal films. If you compare the Hammer films to the true classic Universal films then I would say they pale by comparison. Unfortunately the classic films were replaced with some rather cheaply made quickies in the 40's and 50's. Even though these cheaper films may hold fond memories for those who grew up with them, it is easy to see that these Hammer films were a much needed improvement. The biggest factor was they were shot in glorious color! I know...I know....Color? I love the old black and Whites as they have an unsurpassed creepiness. Now that so much time has gone by, I thought I would give Hammer another try. I started with Hammer's breakthrough film \\"The Curse Of Frankenstein\\" and then to the film in this review \\"Horror Of Dracula\\"  This film is very good, but I must admit that I prefer Lugosi. Lee is more menacing with his sheer size, blood shot eyes and bloody fangs but, Lugosi is more subtle and eerie. Over all this is a very good horror film with great actors, sets and a restored passion to a dying genre...at the time. The DVD transfer looks very good but has minimal extras.....too bad!
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men is one of those rare apocalyptic movies that stimulates apprehension from the first frame. I can't say that watching it was an enjoyable or entertaining experience for me. It sets up a depressingly filthy, hopeless world that makes you want to drench yourself under a hot shower. Visually stunning, atmospherically bleak, teetering on the edge of terror, Children certainly makes its point with undeniable force and  immediacy. It was only a day or so after seeing this film that I felt comfortable thinking about it. Terse, well directed, with performances effective because of their restraint, in Children of Men Alfonso Cuaron gives us a graphic version of the way we might become because of the way we were and are. Humanity can use more visions (nightmares) like this one to bring reality to the stream of warnings that flow through the daily news on a depressingly regular basis. Not fun to watch, but should not be ignored because of that.

B000J103OI|5.0|This flick is devilishly fun.<br /><br />Young, niave and frumpy Andrea (played with wide-eyed charm and subtle wit by Anne Hathaway) gets a job as Miranda Priestly's second assistant for Miranda's fashion magazine Runway, a job which \\"millions of girls would kill for.\\" Andrea, however, has her sights set on being a serious journalist and describes her new job as \\"either this or tv guide.\\"<br /><br />But in walks...no, struts... diva dragon Miranda Priestly, the mother of all nightmare bosses, tossing out her over the top demands.  Meryl Streep plays...no, inhabits... this role with perfection.  She is cool and powerful, and her wit and comic timing are unmatched.  Her lines and delivery (\\"tales of your incompetence do not interest me\\") are dead-on hilarious.  She has every swish of the hand, every lift of the chin, and every dreaded purse of the lips on spot.  Yet occasionally she displays just a hint of vulnerability which makes her surprisingly empathetic.<br /><br />Emily Blunt, the overworked and bitingly sarcastic \\"first assistant\\" and Stanley Tucci are also superb.<br /><br />Andrea's subsequent struggles, her determination not to fail at this job, her adaptations to the fashion world, and her final choices after she has seen the dark side of high fashion (and, of course, Miranda's responses to all this) make this both a funny and oddly captivating movie.<br /><br />And the clothes, of course, are to die for.
B00007JMCX|2.0|After watching \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth,\\" I played the new DVD of \\"All About Eve.\\" Some contrast, eh? There couldn't be any two more-different films. Unfortunately, \\"Eve\\" shows rather harshly what is so very wrong with \\"Man.\\" (Hmmm...)<br /><br />Remember the scene where Margo Channing is awakened at midnight by an operator announcing that her long-distance call to Bill Sampson is ready? Margo knows nothing about the call, but gradually figures out that it was scheduled by Eve Harrington.<br /><br />Margo's not happy about this, and as she hangs up and lights a cigarette, her facial expressions show that she's finally starting to realize that Eve might not be a sweet ing&eacute;nue but a conniving little [female canine].<br /><br />Margo says not a word, but we know exactly what's going through her mind, courtesy of a talented actress. \\"All About Eve\\" is a Mankewicz talkfest, in which virtually everything is spelled out in the dialog, so this use of facial expression -- rather than words -- is surprising. But whether by word or expression, throughout \\"All About Eve\\" we are always aware of what the characters are thinking, and why.<br /><br />This is the problem with \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\\" Newton's \\"fall\\" from advanced alien to feckless, affectless alcoholic is never properly dramatized. We don't know his original mental state, nor do we see why the banality and materialism of human existence are so effective in pulling him down. The scenes that show how and why these things occur don't exist. They were never written, and the director didn't seem to think they were needed. Yet they are the sine qua non of the story.<br /><br />It's true that great works of art are often open to multiple interpretations. But deliberately making a motion picture ambiguous by leaving out critical information about a character's emotional development does not add to its richness.<br /><br />The plot holes are annoying. Why is Newton (what an obvious name!) prevented from piloting his space ship? Who are the people who want to take over his company? How are they able to get away with murdering the company's president? Why is Newton locked away and examined by scientists who aren't aware he's alien?<br /><br />The film's lack of scientific and technical logic also rub the wrong way. Why does Newton's planet need water -- one of the most-common substances in the universe? Why doesn't Newton come to Earth in a reusable space ship? And why is Newton's first consumer product -- an instant-picture camera -- so drearily inferior to an SX-70?<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing thing about \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" is that it wastes David Bowie's beautiful performance.

0345494997|2.0|I found it hard to give a darn about this book.  I like my history straight, thank you, and almost never read fictionalized accounts of actual events, no matter how compelling the story seems.  But, having received it as a Christmas gift, I gave it an honest try and really really wanted to report to the giver that I enjoyed it.  However, my ability to stretch the truth deserted me in the face of boring one- dimensional characters, the total lack of illuminating insights and over reliance on source material to the exclusion of imagination.  Perhaps there was a grand and transcendental passion between Mamah and Frank that justified the pain they inflicted on so many lives.  Perhaps it was just fun sex that ended badly.  If you rely on this book for new insights it will forever remain a mystery.
B000Y179KO|1.0|I love the Eagles, but I guess I've never felt the need to own anything other than Greatest Hits 71-75 and Vol. 2.  I'm usually not one to own only Greatest Hits albums of bands that I like, but for some reason these 2 CD's work for me.  So the new Eagles album caught my eye and I read some good reviews on here saying this is a \\"masterpiece\\" and old Eagles fans will love it.  Absolutely not!  This CD is worthless.  I guess I should have known with the fact that you can only buy it from Wal Mart!  Come on!  The ONLY good song is How Long, and I guess the Christmas song is ok too.  The rest are a bunch of sappy, whiny, contrived piles of garbage.  Don't give Wal Mart any more money.
B000W4KT6E|3.0|I've seen (and mostly forgotten) the 1988 (John Waters) version, and was looking forward to this one. Overall, I was slightly disappointed. The movie can't quite decide if it's a light comedy about a teenage dance show, a socially conscious film about race relations, or an over-the-top satire. I found Tracy's earnest social consciousness forced and not believable, and many of the songs (particularly the opener) flat and mildly annoying.  On the other hand, the performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken were great, especially the scene where the two of them are alone in the gag-gift shop. The dance numbers were also well-staged and great fun.
0143038419|4.0|Captivating story of how Liz Gilbert, a successful writer from the US, decides to leave her old life and old self behind for a year to go on a quest of pleasure, spiritual enlightenment and love by living in Italy, in an ashram in India and in Bali. I found the first chapter on Italy particularly excellent, and the other two also interesting though those not so interested in spirituality/meditation etc. might not find it that interesting. Overall it is a wonderful example of how women can go against the odds and expectations of society to fullfil their own ambitions and discover who they really are.
B000OV170W|1.0|Holy Jesus, this book sucked.  This is my first review.  The only reason I am taking the time to write this is to save even one soul from the wretchedness of this book.  Cliches all the way around.  The premise was fascinating, but by the time I had read 30 pages, i figured it was only going to get worse.  The deus ex machina at the end was worse than watching War of the Worlds with Tome Cruise.  Deus ex machina means Hand of God and is used by incredibly lazy writers.  Her other books may be good, but I sure as hell will never find out.      Switching perspectives and narrators can be a wonderful way to tell a story and make it more involving.  Yet, all the characters had the same sappy voice that made you wish they were real so you could punch them hard in the face.  More often than not I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to be able to tell who I was reading.  And talk about manipulative writing.  She tries to make you cry every other page and it wears thin after two pages or so.  I am a guy so maybe that's why I hated it with such passion, but her female readers cannot possibly be this dumb.  If someone gave this book five stars and is not in Jodi Picoult's immediate family they shouldn't be allowed to read.  Actually, check out their other five star reviews so you know when not to waste your time.    I love books and I read voraciously.  The only reason to read this is so you know how horrid a book can be.  Stay away.

B000FVQLQQ|4.0|A Beautiful Mind is not Crowe's best picture, perhaps, but it is one in which he shows his depth as an actor.  Having reviewed his performances in 3:10 to Yuma, Master and Commander, Gladiator, Cinderella Man, A Good Year, Mystery,Alaska, Proof of Life and others, I certainly would not have thought to cast Crowe in the part of a maverick mathematician but the casting works somehow. Crowe plays Nash's role convincingly and effectively communicates the awful agony of the schizophrenic mind.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly plays Crowe's wife, Alicia Nash, in the film and makes the role her own.  I felt her terror and confusion as she grappled with her husband's increasing paranoia.  The scene with the baby in the bathtub took me to the edge.  Connelly plays the scene with just the right balance of panic and hysteria.  She richly deserved the Academy Award for her performance.<br /><br />A nod should be given to Ed Harris for his mysterious role as Parcher in the film. I originally watched the film because Harris played a part but found Crowe's portrayal gripping and somewhat disturbing.

B000Y7U98W|3.0|I like Danny Boyle as a director. I thnk that he's done some wonderfully offbeat films and his next projects out always come as a surprise as he leaps from genre to genre.     First off, lets start with this title as a blu-ray hi-def transfer: solid, easily 4 to 4.5 out of 5 stars for the picture quality (PQ). Fox has done a good job here, especially with all the flare present within the film (this is a film that centers around the sun after all - I find that flares created some problems in older HD releases but this seems to have been ironed out over the last few months). The audio quality (AQ) is fantastic with a 7.1 lossless track it is just sublime.     Now, we'll move to the film itself. There's no denying that this film is beautiful to look at and the FX are top notch. The acting is fairly solid all around with some really good turns by the Japanese sensation, Hiroyuki Senada as Capt. Kenada, Cliff Curtis as Dr. Searle, and Chris Evans as Mace. Evans was a rather large surprise as I've found him often to be a bit too tongue-in-cheek for my tastes. However, he turns in a good performance with the material that was given to him.    And here lies the problem. The material on display in the form of the screenplay by Alex Garland has some flashes of brilliance, but overall there are just too many ideas missed or ideas brought up that are just flat out stupid, possibly for the sake of developing more action beats. Some examples of this are: a) the location of the hydroponics garden - why have any windows whatsover exposed, it's not like these plants are going to see natural sunlight as your ship is stuck behind a massive shield of mirrors. In fact, hydroponics would probably be at the hub of any long-mission space ship and would be one of the most protected areas of this ship. b) you've got a ship, a reactively intelligent ship/computer (i.e. it provides answers and questions during routine query by the crew) but this ship/computer, which has displayed unconscious concern (I'm not saying that the ship/computer is AI or anything) in the first scene with Dr. Searle (it tells Searle that he cannot lower the filter while he's watching the sun to above 3.1% after he asks for 4% because of harmful conditions), this ship/computer is unable to catch fairly simple miscalculations that result in the mirror-sheild being damaged because the crewmember in charge of these calculations \\"forgot\\" to reset the shield.     And I'm just getting started here. There are so many dumb and/or cliched moments in this film that could've been so much more effective if the writer and director has just asked some simple questions. I understand the need to keep this type of production commercial, but there are numerous possibilities that this story offers up that are never explored or glossed over (i.e. Searle's exploration into the psychology of the sun - sure Pinbacker displays some aspects, but it is rarely thoughtful or philosophical in nature as it appears to be set up by Searle at the beginning of the film).     I would recommend seeing this film, and again, it's beautiful to watch and listen to on a great Home Theater system, but this cannot be viewed as anything but a film with loads of potential but mostly remains mediocre in its storytelling.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|Sunshine had an epic trailer that was impossible to live up to, especially considering that they wouldn't be able to use Clint Mansell's score in the film itself. The film is visually impressive and there are moments of beauty. I love the score. The premise is interesting - this is visionary stuff. Boyle also creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.     It riffs off [[ASIN:B000E1NXAY Event Horizon (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] unfortunately, and the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense. At times where I was supposed to be engaged I was just confused. The director also made some strange artistic choices in the editing room. Ironically when it becomes silliest (crazy Christian pyscho-killer) is when I became most interested.
B00081912E|5.0|The Mask DVD is very fantastic on the basis of clarity and sound. It is very good 5.1 sound out.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Superb performance by Pitt and Blanchett in portraying life's miserable moments. I'm new to the director's work BUT I have to say he did good at his job.
0810993139|5.0|I'm a grown woman, and got this for my niece.  I found myself reading it this summer while I was helping a friend in her library, and wanted to share it with her.  Couldn't put it down.  If you have a child that doesn't like reading, get this book for them.  It might just get them hooked.  A new one comes out in February, and I plan on getting it too.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|Not my kind of movie BUT being a Nic Cage I had to see it. He played the part well. I'ts based off comic book stories so it should be seen as just that...fantasy stuff or is it?? I thought it interesting when the narrator suggested it might have been similar to a true story.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I can still remember some of the most fun-filled exciting times of my life - 1982 - 1984 -- basically during the time that Thriller was released, the videos were released, and Michael Jackson mania officially began. And it all begins with this killer album chock full of some of the most excellently produced songs that stand the test of time. From Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' to Thriller, Lady In My Life, Billie Jean, PYT, each song is so incredibly produced, detailed instrumentation (REAL MUSIC) with thumping grooves that make me bounce in my seat and reflect on the happy times of Thriller. And the fact that MJ's influence still impacts so many of today's singers and entertainers, well, it just makes me proud and happy to be around to witness this wonderful phenomenon. I remember how everywhere you went people were talking about MJ (in a good way); they dressed like him, sung his songs, danced like him, wanted to meet him, you name it. And the day after Motown 25, when he performed Billie Jean, I recall going to the mall and everywhere I went people - white, black, old, young - were talking about his dancing. It was so exciting and I am happy to still listen to Thriller and cannot wait until the 25th anniversay DVD comes out. I've already pre-ordered my copy and am eager to relive the excitement all over again. Thanks Michael and Quincy for giving us some of the greatest music that we could ever wish for.
B000000WA4|5.0|I was in high school when this album came out, and honestly wanted it just because everyone else did. My parents got it for me and I swear it never left my CD player (except to change to the other disc) my entire high school career. I was never a Smashing Pumpkins fan until hearing this album, but it was love at first listen. Mellon Collie is unique as it doesn't all sound the same, and there are songs that will bring tears to my eyes. I've long since worn out the discs, but now have it downloaded onto my iPod, and \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" will be the first song that my fiance and I dance to as husband and wife at our wedding next year.
B00005AG7K|1.0|As the old saying goes.....Buyer BEWARE! This is for the die-hard Beatles Fans ONLY. The quality of the DVD is worse than poor. It's as if the copy was made from a recorded VHS televised airing of the movie. The sound quality of the songs, though, are very good. But. The video quality is beyond awful. At times, the video is washed out and unwatchable. I only paid $8.00 for my copy. I would recommend not paying more than $2.00. Unless you are a very die-hard Beatles fan and MUST have everything they've done. I'm sure in Time, an OFFICIAL release of this movie will come about.
B000069AUI|5.0|\\"A Rush of blood to the head\\" is destined to be a favorite among thousands because of its first rate lyrics. Admittedly it is sometimes hard to understand what the Chris Martin is talking about, but the lyrics are easy to memorize. For instance in the song \\"Green Eyes\\" he says, \\"Honey, you are the rock upon which I stand and I come here to talk. I hope you understand.\\" Martin, Coldplay's main vocalist and piano player, sings that verse with a very clear and soft voice which makes you feel like you are drinking the purest and sweetest water.<br />  In addition to how easy it is to memorize, the lyrics are also relatable and they tap into your emotions. In the song \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" Martin sings, \\"I said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down, yeah, I'm gonna put it six feet underground, I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn, to do back the things it did to you in return.\\" What he is saying is that he wants to get back at something, for someone he loves because it hurt them.<br />  Most importantly, Coldplay's lyrics never fail to create a clever picture. In the song \\"A Warning Sign\\" Martin says, \\"You came back to haunt me, and I realized you were an island and I passed you by, you were an island to discover.\\" The way he says that gives you a clear picture of what he feels and of what he did wrong.<br />  Not only are the lyrics fantastic, but Chris Martin is a phenomenal pianist. Who doesn't instantly recognize the intro to \\"Clocks\\"? Martin's talent effectively showcases the relatable, emotional and memorable lyrics on the popular album. Coldplay's album \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is basically what triggered most people's affection for Coldplay. Because of Coldplay, alternative may become many people's favorite genre.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|We watched this with all the cousins over the holidays on Grandma's new hi-def TV. Not only was the story entertaining, but the graphics were AMAZING. I felt like I could reach out and touch the main characters every hair. I could go on and on about the visuals. But the story was very good, too. Especially since we just got back from France and Italy; the french and italian chefs in the movie were so on the mark! I give this movie ***** for animation, *** for plot, **** for holding the interests of elementary age and teen age kids (and adults).
B000P0J02E|5.0|Great calendar, all the pictures are of very high quality. I do wish you would switch to US Postal service shipping though UPS is a terrible service.
032147404X|5.0|The cover looks boring -- especially with the \\"Digital\\" branded generic camera on the front. But it's an amusing and useful little book. The photo-on-every-page motif gets old, especially when it forces text to break over two pages unnecessarily.     A very informally written book, almost awkwardly so at times, but very easy to read and informative. Sounds like something I'd write if I knew a lot about photography :)    I bought several similar books, this is definitely the favorite. Full of tips.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|This Moive is still amazing years after. the transfer is exceptional. anyone that complains about film grain doesn't know about film. Of course it has some grian in it. It's Film! a high res scan of the film is going to pick up the same grain you saw in the movie theatre! good colors, nice cleanup and great movie all around.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This was my first (sorry, late adopter) album for Rage, and still my favorite -- every track explodes!    If you only buy one Rage album, get this.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|trust me on this, i have owned a copy of the original japanese version of this film for years. it is one of the creepiest films i've seen in a long time. there were a couple key moments that totally destroyed me and wouldn't you know it, those are the scenes they changed for the american remake. my personal opinion is that the american version of \\"the ring\\" was superior to the original japanese version, but if you're going to watch this movie, and don't mind reading subtitles, go with the japanese version.
B000024KBA|5.0|No needs for words like Magic or Wierd, one Man and one Music, as much as he was \\"crazy\\" as much this music heals....Wonderfull!
B00030DEQE|5.0|Have several of these on 3 different operating systems: Win 2000, Win Xp and Linux.  All of them work excellently and at high transfer rates.  No compatibility issues, no problems, they just work.
B0002YLC24|5.0|A movie that throws you through the full spectrum of emotions.  I saw it before the first one, and I must say I love it much more after seeing Before Sunrise.  It's so different from every other movie and it just swept me away.  I love it.  I'm so happy I finally own it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I love it. Good bass and high frequency.<br /><br />Excellent sound. Excellents headphones.
079073804X|4.0|Friedkin's scare flick still has legs--thirty-plus years later. Get it. The making-of doc is interesting.<br /><br />I thought some of the dialogue Detective Kinderman had to say (liking to go to movies and discus same) just didn't sit right. Also, the idea that Regan's mom was an actress (in a movie) didn't fly with me...but other than that, the film works--all the way. Cobb, Burstyn, Jason Miller, Linda Blair...et al...make for a solid cast.<br /><br />I think William Friedkin is one of the finest directors around, if not the best, when it comes to creating atmosphere and using extras.<br /><br />Lastly, if you're the religious type and believe in demons...you just may want to stay clear of this fright classic.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Excellant movie all the actors were very good but,George C.Scott was excellant in this role as General Patton and in the sequel Last Days of Patton.It's really sad that this true hero of WWII could die the way he did,and George C. Scott died and never accepted the Academy award he won for his role in Patton.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|This was one of the best science fiction films I had seen in years with great writing, good acting, super visuals but no!!!!! they couldn't leave it on that level. The last 30 minutes are a heartbreak. I don't know who made the writers or director change the ending, I know this can't be what they had in mind. This film bordered on truly great but as soon as the mad slasher was thrown in to the plot I started thinking about supper or what I was going to do the next day as I lost all interest in the film. What a waste with an ending so bad that you feel you had been sold on a great car and it turns out to be a lemon after you bought it. I expect Friday the Thirteenth movies to be boring, predictable, for teenyboppers so I am not disappointed. This film had so much promise so the junk at the end disgusted me with the extreme trashing of talent. Pathetic.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This movie is a definate classic witch has been remastered into its original black & white release which is clearest sharpest that I have ever seen.
B000W07EKW|5.0|I purchased a video for each of my son in laws.......they both gave this collection a 2 thumbs up!!
B00009UW0N|3.0|This movie is truly a classic horror movie from Director John Carpenter but,although the sequels were many the remake (Uncut Version) by Director Rob Zombie at least explains the why for Michael Meyers insanity with causes from parental abuse & bullying by his peers and sister.
0307341550|5.0|What a great book!  The perfect combination of mystery, suspense and relationships.  I couldn't put it down!
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I loved this version of Hairspray. Amanda Bynes is a bubbly and delightful new star. John Travolta's performance is very funny and at times, very touching. He brings a refreshing \\"femininity\\" to a role that has always been played by a man in drag, but John is convincing as a woman. Christopher Walken is, as usual, unabashedly willing to do anything for a laugh. And you WILL laugh (and dance, and sing) and be totally entertained.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Terminator 3  DVD<br /><br />  In Terminator 3 (T3) the cyborg is a newer model, a TX, I believe and she's not after John Connor as the primary target, but his \\"to-be-wife, Catherine Brewster.  This movie has a lot of great lines, such as\\"<br /><br />-What is sexy( not really a line ,but on a billboard)<br />-I like your car<br />-I like your gun<br />-I lied<br />-You are terminated<br />-she'll be back,<br />-I'm back<br /><br />I really enjoyed the use of music to intensify each perilous moment in the movie.<br /><br />Hollywood sure loves chase scenes and gasoline fires.  Ther's a ton of each in this.<br /><br />BTW, what is it with Arnold and the sunlasses?<br /><br />Have you noticed how we/Hollywood anthromorphize the robots so that they have two eyes in their head?  Why not more eyes.?<br /><br />Anyhow this movie begs at least two thing:<br /><br />1) a fourth movie ( well, FOX  is coming out with a TV series so maybe that's the plan.<br />2) A trilogy or quadrilogy set of DVD's like Alien<br /><br />Highly recommended for Terminator fans, Arnold fans and fans of Science Fiction movies.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2007
6304493681|3.0|Though having had a lukewarm reception in Japan, director Mamoru Oshii's film adaptation of Masamune Shirow's manga was hailed in America as one of the most groundbreaking animated movies of its time and has made anime itself a staple in mainstream pop culture.  But whether the relentlessly hyped \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" still maintains its beauty rests in the eye of the beholder.    In a world where technology dictates everyday life but fails to erase nations and ethnic groups, the agents of Section 9, a secret organization, are on the hunt for the Puppet Master, a mysterious hacker infiltrating the digitized brains of government officials.  As \\"Major\\" Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg soldier, delves deeper into the mystery, what she finds leads her to question her own existence, as well as the bond between man and machine.    Among the first films to use traditional cel animation with computer animation the visuals, while nothing new to most of us, were quite a feat in the film's heyday.  From the creation of the Major's cybernetic body to her wandering through the inner-city streets, the results simply speak for themselves.  As for the story, one of political intrigue, espionage and spirituality, is actually simple to follow once you get pass all that jargon.  Like the manga, eye candy is also prevalent here; since Major's body is completely prosthetic, she doesn't seem to mind showing off all that (fake) skin.  But if anything complements the film to perfection, it's the soundtrack composed by Kenji Kawai, featuring a haunting Japanese wedding song which goes well with the image of the \\"marriage\\" of man and machine.  The DVD itself features interviews, credits and an English trailer.    This film is unrated: Graphic Violence, Nudity, Adult Situations.
B000002UAC|3.0|The music is worth four or five stars.  The reproduction worth 1 or 2. That said,  I'm not one who grew up in the fifties or sixties.  My days were the seventies, you know, Skynyrd, Zeppelin, Nugent etc.  So I understand why some listeners discount the early sixties music (its not progressive or whatever), BUT the Beatles had been progressing from day 1. To UNDERSTAND any artist you need to know where they are coming from!  Besides, this album accurately reproduces or comes closest to a live performance of any album with the exception of Let It Be or Please Please Me.  AND this is when the Beatles were performing VERY WELL together, having recently left the club circuit.  Most listeners, especially younger ones, do not know or appreciate the fact that the Beatles were an amazingly tight energetic act in the early sixties. That is who they were.  What we get later is mucho production ala George Martin and others and Sgt Pepper is what they eventually became. Much of their music following Pepper was an attempt to recapture this sound (beleive it or not) albeit more updated and progressive.           For the period (1963) its pretty darn good Rock 'n' Roll, plain and simple.  They had already progressed passed the \\"Thank You, Girl\\" stage. The songwriting is pretty good, except for a couple lukewarm efforts, and the cover versions of other artists are plain electric.  Some of the songs rank with their best, such as \\"All My Loving\\" and \\"All I've Got to Do\\".  \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" speaks for itself. \\"Money\\",  \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" are excellent covers.    Now to the reproduction.  Why is it mono? They really couldn't find a good master for this project? My old stereo Parlophone LP sounds a lot better than this CD. Maybe E.M.I would like to borrow it to remaster the CD in stereo!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I dont have one complaint about the concert. The sound quality is excellent, picture is really awesome, and the lighting for the stage is really amazing. The Eagles are truly one of the greatest rock bands out there. This DVD like Journey's Live in Houston concert are concerts that any rock fan out there should have.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I asked my Gen X son for this CD for Christmas. Just had a chance today to listen to it from start to finish.  Maybe it was my Bose system in my car, but I found myself being taken to a different time and place and I was hooked from the very beginning.  I wasn't expecting the CD to sound like the Eagles music from 30 years ago, although several songs reminded me of vintage Eagles. Their willingness to experiment a little was intriguing and the harmony is second to none.  Of course, I have always loved Joe Walsh and was glad to hear him once again.  To my way of thinking, I feel this is the best album yet. It does my \\"boomer\\" heart good  to know that these guys still \\"kick it\\" and for awhile, I felt young again.  Rock on, Eagles:)
B000002UAU|5.0|Breaking down each track on this album is not something that I would even attempt as many other reviewers have down a great job of that. This album is to be judged by it's overall effect as a contribution to society. Yes, that sounds absurd, but I believe that sometimes things can be way more than what they appear, and the Beatles and Sgt Peppers are part of that. 5 stars can't begin to express the rating of this work of art. I react very strangely to listening to it however. It causes me pain. The pain that comes with realizing that time travel is impossible. I was a young kid in 67 and every person on the planet (or so it seems) owned this album. Everywhere you went, the sound of \\"Pepper's\\" could be heard from windows if you were walking the street. Every house you walked into had this as it's theme. It was as if the world was actually united in it's awe of what these guys had produced. The music is timeless, a work of genius. You hear so many critics and fans use the word genius in reference to musicians and 90 per cent of the time it is overstatement. Not so with these guys, together they formed a force that was way more than a music group. Rubber Soul and Revolver were works of art, but this one took it over the top, sealed the deal, made it clear that there were no limits. I don't listen to Sgt Peppers anymore, but I love it like a lost friend or lover. If I listen to Pepper's it makes me yearn to return to those days of the summer when it all was so fresh and new. I honestly feel that everything past Pepper's is somehow a re-work, an attempt to capture whatever constitued that hold on the world that the Beatles had. John would have said \\"we were just a rock combo, nothing more\\", but then by the time he said that the \\"we\\" was gone and so was the magic. As a young boy I went to Woodstock and when I was there, in the middle of the mud, I only thought it was a rather uncomfortable rock concert and not until I was back home with my parents did I realize what a bigdeal it was. In a similar way, because he was in the eye of the storm, John was unable to see the significance of the Beatles. Seeing what society has become, what the music industry is producing, there is no doubt that the \\"magic\\" is lost. My god, I heard a guy say on MTV the other day that Nirvana was that generations Beatles. God, did they get short changed or what? I liked Nivana, I like the Foo Fighters, but I don't even begin to call that art or magic. Grunge, like Punk etc. was a phase, a step on a walk, the Beatles were the journey itself. Pepper's is a monument to a place in time, a pinicle that cannot be equalled. If you haven't \\"experienced\\" this music, it is a must, but like reading and understanding what greatness there is in a Hemingway novel, you really need that time machine.
0316113506|5.0|This book explains in clear terms the role exercise plays in our mental processes.  Moving our muscles produces proteins that play roles in our highest thought processes.  Ratey says, \\"thinking is the internalization of movement.\\"  He illustrates this with the story of the sea squirt that hatches with a rudimentary spinal cord and 300 brain cells.  It has only hours to find a spot of coral on which to put down roots or die.  When it does put down roots, it eats its brain.  According to Ratey only a moving animal needs a brain.    He begins with the value exercise has for the learning process in high school students: improved academic performance, alertness, attention and motivation.    He cites studies that say we can alter our mental states by physically moving.  He said depression is the leading cause of disability in the U.S.  He then presents a chapter where depression is relieved in case studies by exercise.    Among the areas Ratey covers are: stress, depression, ADD, and aging.  This book is a great motivator for exercise.    However, Ratey's work was preceded by Glenn Doman's.  Doman advocated exercise for brain injured children in the 1950s when the only 'treatment' was to institutionalize them.  He later started a `super babies' program.  Both the educational and medical establishments attacked and marginalized Doman's work.
0525950079|4.0|Anyone who enjoyed Pillars will absolutely fall in love with Caris and root for Merthin as they struggle with love, sickness and duplicity within the Kingsbridge city walls. The story takes place over a thirty five year period as Follet follows the lives and struggles of characters in Caris, Merthin, Gwenda, Wulfric and the several villains...Several reviews on WWE clearly missed Follet's attempt to make this a true mass market read by suggesting there was too much sex or that this didn't live up to Pillars or accuratley depict 14th century England..It reminded me at times of Irving Stone's Agony and Ectasy and other great works of historic fiction...If you enjoyed his classics you will definitely enjoy.
0525950079|1.0|This book is a TERRIBLE representation of medieval life. The author has no concept of historical research, nor does his editor own an etymological dictionary. I'm sorry, people were not saying \\"Let's go shag in the forest\\" in the 12 or 13th centuries!    I forced myself to finish this book, but I must say it was quite painful. If you've ever read any decent historical fiction (Sharon Kay Penman, for example), then this book will disappoint you. Regardless of the historical inaccuracies, the writing is simply not very good. Follett's sentences are repetitive, his plot is predictable, and his characters are weak as water.      Don't waste your time or money.
B000002N2P|5.0|Green Day, one of the greatest bands of the past 15 years. Their major label debut, Dookie, released in 1994 took the reigns of punk-rock and brought it to a brand new audience who was experiencing it for the first time, and what an awesome experience it was, and still is. One thing about Green Day is that their sound is thrilling and unpredictable, they seem to always take their sound to a new level, leaving the previous elements in place but adding a whole bunch of new ones to make the sound heavier, or faster, or happier, but whatever it is, it's oustanding work. With Dookie, the band rocked with a bit of a lighter tone and many of the songs seemed to connect very well with youth, such as Longview, Basket Case and When I Come Around to name a few. The entire album seemed to flow extremely well and it was relentless with its catchy rhythms and fast, heavy guitar lines. Enter 1995, enter Insomniac! This record is the band's heaviest and hardest work, with many of the songs featuring a very punk oriented sound, while not sacrificing any of the catchy hooks that made Dookie such a success. Insomniac is a severely underrated album in my opinion and I believe it challenges Dookie for Green Day's finest work, but the band has put out such a strong catalog of material that it's hard to choose just one album out of the bunch to crown as their top album. Here is a song by song breakdown of the album.     1. Armatage Shanks 9/10- A very strong lead-off track, this song sets the tone for the rest of the record for sure. Fast and catchy, you'll be singing along in no time.     2. Brat 10/10- A very amusing song about a young man wishing to get his parental inheritance any way possible. Although it's a very short tune, it's so fast and incessantly rhythmic that 1:30 will seem like way less. Great, great tune.     3. Stuck With Me 8.5/10- The first few listens I wasn't sure about this song, but it became one of my favorites after a while. It's a very strong song with a strongrhythm, nice.     4. Geek Stink Breath 10/10- One of my top three tracks on this album. This was a single and had a very memorable video with a young man getting a tooth pulled by a dentist. This track hits like a freight train and is probably their most punk song they've ever released. Highly highly recommend this one.     5. No Pride 9.5/10- Maybe the catchiest song on the album, it's interesting how Longview and Geek Stink Breath are both track 4 on their respective albums and seem to be the heaviest tracks, and Welcome to Paradise and No Pride have a similar relationship of being the catchy catchy tune to follow. Maybe it's just a coincidence. Dig this tune!     6. Bab's Uvula Who 10/10- Another one of my top three. It's so fast and heavy that you can't help but like it. This song is vintage Green Day and really demonstrates their sound well.     7. 86  9.5/10- There's no return to 86! The memorable chorus line talks about Green Day's past and they really don't have too many songs like this one. A very melodic and catchy way for Green Day to go back to their roots.     8. Panic Song 9/10- I really, really like the long intro where a different instrument is added every few seconds. This Green Day song is truly one of a kind, there isn't any other song like it.     9. Stuart and the Ave. 8/10- This is a decent tune for sure, it's not my favorite, but it's still a pretty strong track. The song keeps getting better as it goes.     10. Brain Stew 10/10- Everybody probably knows the 10 note guitar line, and the famous lyrics about Billie Joe's inability to get any shut-eye. This song is just so good, it almost defines the album.     11. Jaded 10/10- Speedy, catchy punk, very fun song to listen to and a great follow-up to Brain Stew.     12. Westbound Sign 8.5/10- Maybe I shouldn't make a judgment about this song because I haven't listened to it enough times to be sure, but I really liked what I heard.     13. Tightwad Hill 9.5/10- A great lead-up to the grand finale.The bridge in the middle of the song is outstanding.     14. Walking Contradiction 10/10- The crowned jewel of Insomniac! Probably the best tune on the album, it will be in your head for hours after just one listen. The lyrics are so cleverly written and the music video is hilarious.     Insomniac is a fantastic album, highly recommended!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|'Ratatouille' ranks, in my mind, as the best Pixar film since [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]].  It's no surprise that writer-director Brad Bird, possessor of long-standing Disney roots, shaped and directed both of these masterpieces.  It's also thrilling to know that 'Ratatouille' earned not only the respect, but also the glowing admiration of both the French public and its gastronomic elite.  This is a movie that took the time to get the details right and present the French in their rightful role of world leaders in culinary achievements.  If you doubt that, watch the DVD extra with Thomas Keller (a consultant to the film) and note how all his career- and idea-forming experiences were all based in France or of French origin.<br /><br />'Ratatouille' is a movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  In fact, it seems - by a long stretch - to be the most adult-targeted of all Pixar's works to date.  For example, critic Anton Ego's pronouncements (fleshed out with an amazing voice characterization by Peter O'Toole) are something that would fly 100% over the head of your average eight-year-old.  The single best scene in the movie is when Ego tastes Remy's Ratatouille and is immediately transported into a warm reverie of his mother's similar dish.  That scene gave me goose bumps.  Fantastic stuff from Brad Bird and the whole Pixar team.

0876852630|5.0|It's the first Bukowski book I ever read, and it's still my favorite.  And while it's not the chronological beginning of his story, it makes a nice introduction.  He seems like an angry, godless, drunken, self-loathing Kerouac.  I love it.
B000FUTQ8C|5.0|This series, the legends of dune is a very good read and story. It did much to develop the characters and their motivations plus backgrounds for the actual Dune series. Really explained much that was missing from the original Dune books. A keeper.
B000FC1LOC|3.0|Thought-provoking and dramatic.  Ending was too far-fetched and unfortunate for such a strong book with insightful narratives from each character's perspective.  Definitely worth a read and for me was a great introduction to Jodi Picoult's style - I am now a fan and am trawling my way through her work.
1592332803|5.0|My husband and I love this cookbook.  For both of us, the transition to becoming vegan was a bit scarey.  We were sad about the possibility of never having all of our favorite comfort foods.  Thanks to the cookbook we make peanut butter cookies, lemon bars, and yummy muffins and feel nothing but excitement and pleasure with every delicious bite.      The book is also very user friendly.  The pictures are beautiful and the information is presented in such an accessible manner.  We are such huge fans of the cookbook and the author. We are delighted that we purchased the cookbook.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Really catchy and good poppy tunes.  Great voice.  Nice hook.  Well worth the buy.
1878424505|5.0|I think this book should be a mandatory bookto read in school.  It is mindopening, freeing, uplifting and inspiring.  If every person reading this book would take to heart and mind, and then put into practice and live by it, the world would be a different place.  Depression could be a thing of the past.  This is the best book I have read, it is so easy and simple, but that's the point. We complicate our lifes by thinking any other way.  It's the secret in ACTION.  I gave this book to many people and friends and they were all thankfulfor receiving it.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|And I mean that in a good way.<br /><br />I don't think I have really 'seen' this movie until now; It was funny to listen to the people in the room constantly saying 'Whoa!' as each new scene began; The scenery, the neon, the smoke filled rooms coupled with blue beams of flickering light, the rain, the buildings...just amazing. True eye candy in every sense of the word. And of course the story and acting is top notch; I found myself feeling like I rediscovered an old friend; It is so much fun to see so many talented people in here, many very early in their careers. The dialog and story are just as strong as they have ever been, and it was nothing less that a pure joy to see this movie done up the way it should be. I haven't watched all the different versions, but I will. Tons of great extras for the obsessive fan, too.<br /><br />This movie still packs a punch. Just brilliant across the board. And I don't usually like sci fi, either.
B00005JPS9|3.0|A severely disabled child with extreme behavioural problems is murdered by glory-seekers hired by his father. Understandably, his mother is a little upset. Vengeance ensues... Faithless CGI rendering of the classic tale poses two questions. More than a decade and several billion dollars into the digital era, why can the nerds of Hollywood still not accurately depict human movement or fire? And why is it that our standards of moral decency make it acceptable to show disembowelling, dismembering and gut-clenching cruelty, and yet not the cartoon rendering of a female nipple or a flaccid penis? Baffling questions aside, it's worth seeing. Catch the 3D version at IMAX if you can.
0743496728|5.0|Peter, a kid who got picked on his whole life and never could measure up to his older brother, went on a shooting spree at the high school and killed 10 people.  The action is right at the beginning and the rest of the book uses flashbacks to explain how it came to be that Peter did it.  I felt sorry for Peter but his sad life still didn't excuse what he did.  It is a good book to remind people how our words and actions can and do affect others.  I really coldn't put this one down.<br /><br />Karen Zemek, author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\"
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan was unknown in 1996 as he took a cross-country trip with his brother, Jonathan; who pitched a storyline to him. Christopher loved it and they began to collaborate on the project. Christopher finished his screenplay for a future film before Jonathan finished his short story, which he called MEMENTO MORI. The film did not come to fruition immediately.<br /><br />Nolan was born in England, and he spent his childhood moving back and forth between the United Kingdom and the States; ending up with dual citizenship. In the middle 90's, he had shot a low budget film in London. It was called FOLLOWING, and it was released in 1998. It was shot in black and white, and it had a fractured non-linear plot line. Simultaneously, Nolan's lady friend, Emma Thomas, was pitching his finished script for MEMENTO. It was considered by the executives who saw it, \\"the most innovative script\\" that they had seen in ages. It was green-lighted, and given a budget of 4.5 million dollars. It was originally slated to be shot in Montreal, and then the project shifted to Los Angeles. It was said that at Cannes, after the screening of FOLLOWING, in 1998, Nolan gave a pitch to the audience for funding to make MEMENTO. One just has to admire such audacity.<br /><br />Nolan had felt for a long time that he liked the way commercials and music videos were shot in a non-linear fashion. He also responded to literature presented that way. So he decided to take the methodology, and what he learned on his first feature, refine it and transfer the concept to MEMENTO; creating a wondrous cinematic puzzle of a picture. It certainly is evident that he succeeded beyond his wildest imagination.<br /><br />MEMENTO raises the curtain showing us the end game, an action that is the result of circumstances we do not yet know, presented in color. Then it jumps to a separate narrative line, what we figure out is a flashback, presented in B&W, with our protagonist, Leonard Shelby waking up in a \\"strange\\" motel room. That is when we discover, as he talks to someone on the phone, that he suffers from a rare form of amnesia, known as \\"anterograde\\". \\"I know who I am. I just can't form new memories.\\" When he awakens in that motel room, or in any room, he seems to have to piece together just where he is. Then we are flashed forward to about five minutes ahead of where we left off in the color narrative. Lenny's attention span seems to be about 5 minutes, and each time it begins to fade, we are transported to the B&W storyline shown in what seems chronological order. Odd as it seems, the color narrative is being shown in reverse chronological order; that is to say that the color section is presented in a linear fashion, but each time we return to it, it begins 5 to 10 minutes prior to where we left off, filling in some plot gaps as it approaches the inevitable fade out.<br /><br />As an audience, we are confused, dazzled, and fascinated as we endeavor the meaning of these two independent parallel timelines. We watch, we make assumptions, we surmise, and as the film comes to what might be closure we realize that the two narratives were not parallel, rather they were moving toward each other, one linear from the past, the other in a tantalizing mind-blowing reverse mode, kind of in the present. Suddenly, following the action in the B&W narrative, the two timelines merge, and the action is transformed to color; with the narrative lunging toward us repeating the opening scene of the movie, becoming an action that is more like in the middle of the plotline. Are we more confused? A little perhaps. The plot threads converge and the \\"mystery\\" is explained, although it might not be accurately explicated, and in some ways it only deepens as even more options and solutions present themselves.<br /><br />Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby was astonishingly good, both a lost soul and a dangerous avenger; a man so logical, so meticulous, so organized that he found a way to circumnavigate his inability \\"to form new memories\\". As an actor he has never been more physical, more intimidating and lethal, pulsating with pent-up emotion and energy -yet he manages to capture our empathy, and holds our attention, his hopes become ours, his quest our own. With the odd reverse narrative, the director gets us to rediscover time and place much as Lenny has to, as we careen along beside him, off balance, piecing together the plot like manic chimps putting together a puzzle while swinging on a rope; several ropes.<br /><br />Carrie Ann-Moss as Natalie the bar maid, the gangster's moll, a drug runner, a femme fatale, love interest, abuser, and ten times a bitch -was very effective, creating a character that we can not shake from our senses, emerging as sexy, selfish, and far from innocent. She aspired to be the queen bee, acting as a black widow, shamelessly manipulating all the men in her life; steering toward what she perceived was her big pay off.<br /><br />Joe Pantoliano, a veteran of putz roles, usually playing shady, vicious, unreliable, and untrustworthy types, leaves shadings of all this in his John \\"Teddy\\" Gammel, a man who misrepresents himself to Lenny, changes his identity often, and hides his purpose; whatever that might be, from hour to hour, from episode to episode. Yet his role as cop, or ex-cop, crooked and larcenous, comes off as semi-sympathetic -quite a feat for any actor.<br /><br />This film provokes discussion, after challenging the viewer to stay with it. Director Nolan has created a complex methodology that continues to perplex us, even after multiple viewings. The movie is not easily pigeon-holed or labeled. It requires that we consider the fragility and the ineptness of memory that includes some misrepresentations and implanted data, and is rife with occlusions. MEMENTO has dozens of scenes that change point of view, or particulars of plot, as we experience them; plot elements that surely are in conflict with themselves, perhaps even some teasing red herring moments. I feel that director Nolan intentionally played games with us, as his later suggestions of multiple endings, and his complex DVD and websites data are testament to. Regardless, this is a film like no other, an original that is worthy of both its accolades and its criticism.es\\".

B000K15VSA|5.0|Totally worth it. And I'm not a big DVD guy. And I generally could care less about DVD extras. The five-disc edition totally sets the bar, not only for content, but for presentation. Example: The deleted/alternate scene aren't just a series of two-minutes clips. Using leftover voiceover narration, the producers use the deleted/alternate clips to create, essentially, a whole alternate cut of the movie. Documentaries are great. And the flick is beautiful.

All the other rubbish released and promoted by the Hendrix estate is subpar by comparison.    Of the 3, Axis is my favorite and arguably Jimi's best, composition-wise. The remastering job is quite decent. Now why doesn't someone go out and re-master Are You Experienced?
B000YABYLA|4.0|The thing that separates \\"Juno\\" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances.  From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands.  Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip.  However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is).  Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" is that rare low-budget, independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum.  First-time screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a clear-eyed, largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters.  Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride, while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them.  Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic, unhurried way.  Confident in the strength and appeal of his material, he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.<br /><br />In a star-making turn, young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character, often bringing Juno right to the brink of un-likeability, then pulling back at just the crucial moment, making us see how utterly likeable she truly is.  As the child's father, Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in \\"Superbad,\\"  while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the \\"baby wanted\\" section of the local throwaway.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high-budget, high-octane, testosterone-laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations.  Thus, my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let \\"Juno\\" sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet, inimitable fashion.  I think it works best that way.ng us see how utterly likeable she truly is.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I first heard of A Perfect Circle when I listened to the song \\"Judith\\" of their 2000 album \\"Mer De Noms\\" about 5 years ago, then a year later I heard \\"Weak and Powerless\\" which was featured on the MTV2 Headbangers Ball Vol. 2 compilation, and I soon fell in love with A Perfect Circle. Afterwards, I went out and bought the band's second full length release \\"Thirteenth Step\\" and it was without question one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life, and it became one of my favorite albums as well. Please keep in mind, this is coming from a guy who listens to Pantera, Slayer, Fear Factory, Sepultura, Megadeth, Testament, Machine Head, Kreator, Anthrax, Exodus, Overkill, Suffocation, Death, Nile, Atheist, Behemoth, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Krisiun, Opeth, Morbid Angel, Meshuggah, and other heavy bands like that, I've always been a sucker for good melodic rock, and these guys definately please my ears big time.<br /><br />Now as far as this album goes, \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is an excellent work of art, and it's also a fantastic, beautiful follow up to \\"Mer De Noms\\". From the opening track \\"The Package\\", to the breathtaking, ethereal closer \\"Gravity\\", these twelve songs on here are full of beautiful, spacious, and ominous atmospheres. I've also learned that the album title was a reference to the Twelve Step program. According to frontman Maynard James Keenan on the commentary for the aMotion DVD, the album is a concept album with all of the songs dealing with the problem of addiction from a different perspective. The musicianship on here is very impressive in every way. Billy Howerdel's guitarwork on here is just excellent. Whether it's soft, majestic, addicting, atmospheric melodies or heavy cruching riffs, this guy definately hits his spots, and when it comes to great melodies, Billy's got the stuff, no doubt about it. Jeordie White (you may know him as Twiggy Ramirez, the ex-bassist of Marilyn Manson) is just fantastic on the bass. His bass lines are just pulsating, hypnotic, and commanding throughout. Josh Freese's drumming can range from nice, soft peaceful beats to steady yet heavy pounding beats, it's all good. And of course, Maynard James Keenan's vocals are just absolutely amazing and beautifully melodic throughout. There is no question that he is one of modern rock's greatest vocalists of all time, and believe me, this album prooves it.<br /><br />\\"Thirteenth Step\\" opens up with \\"The Package\\" which starts off with some odd percussion noises, and soft, soothing guitar melodies, with Maynard's eerie yet majestic vocals slowly creeping in. I like when the song builds up momentum at the 4:08 mark with heavy, crunching riffs, and some roaring bass lines. From there, you know the album just grabs your attention, and it only gets better. The second track \\"Weak and Powerless\\" is a nice catchy chorus. Track three \\"The Noose\\" is very beautiful and majestic which features great melodic vocals from Maynard, and haunting yet relaxing guitar strings, and nice steady atmospheric drums, before gaining some momentum with heavier riffs at the 3:34 mark. Track four \\"Blue\\" is another favorite of mine which continues the journey with more hypnotic, addicting musicianship, while the next track and my personal favorite \\"Vanishing\\" is another soft, peaceful, and atmospheric song that brings Pink Floyd to my mind. This song features addicting, peaceful guitar melodies, soothing bass, nice steady drums, and eerie yet beautifully relaxing vocals from Maynard. The sixth track \\"A Stranger\\" is a nice, peaceful, and quiet ballad that features some marvelous accoustic strings that are quietly calming and peacefully embracing, and Maynard's singing is great as well, while track seven \\"The Outsider\\" is a more heavier song that features heavier riffage, and aggressive vocals especially during the chorus. Track nine is a cover of Failure's \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" which is a pretty bizarre yet another good ballad, and track ten \\"Pet\\" which is another favorite of mine that includes crunchy heavy riffs, some nice melodic interludes, and there's even a nice catchy guitar solo as well. The soft, ethereal, and breathtaking closing track \\"Gravity\\" features some more quiet, soothing melodic guitar strings, and great vocals from Maynard as always, as well as a nice relaxing, and spacey sounding guitar solo around the 3:04 mark. A great beautiful song to end this beautiful musical journey.<br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. The Package (7:40) - 5/5<br />2. Weak and Powerless (3:15) - 5/5<br />3.

B000UNYJV8|3.0|I am a Yank and didn't really understand the historical events and culture surrounding this film. And watched this film partially to educate myself on the whole skinhead culture (perhaps a documentary would've served better). While the first half of the film caught my interest, it ultimately disappointed me as I absolutely hated the ending and felt that it was unnecessary to portray Combo, one of the skinhead's, as an unstable psychopath, rather than someone with an honest political agenda. The focus should never have left the tension between Combo and Woody. This was sort of unresolved and really left me feeling kind of cheated. Felt like the writer eventually got tired of the screenplay, ditched being creative and copped out by appealing to the shock factor.

It was tough to have sympathy for Joel Backman especially since his character was not well established.  The story started out somewhat quickly, but once Backman arrived in Italy, the book seemed to be an excuse for Grisham to go to Italy and do \\"research\\" for the book rather than using the country to help tell the story.  Few supporting characters made this even slower at times, and I found myself wondering where it was all going.    All in all worth the (paperback) read, but keep your expectations in check.
B000J103WK|5.0|I have never been to a live concert but when I saw this one on TV, I made a  point of owning it.  It's fun, it's touching, it's memories, it's GREAT!!!      If you love the Eagles, you HAVE to get this DVD.
B000GG4ZKO|5.0|Fabulous book! You will not be able to stop untill you finish the whole book. The main idea is very much like in Celestine Prophecy, The Secret, and What the bleep do we know. In short, it is about learning ones purpose in life, in finding ones way. When we live doing what we really want to do, we are living our Historia Personal. To know what to do, one only has to know what one desires to do, for through our desires we learn about our personal way, the point of our existence.<br /><br />The books talks about the biggest lie of all: That human life is determined by destiny and there is nothing we can do to change it. Meanwhile we are the only ones who determines our destiny. There is no limit to what one can do. As young people we know exactly what we want and believe that everything is possible but as we get older we change our mind because every day we are hearing from people that this is not true.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book greatly and highly recommend it to all

159562015X|5.0|We used this book as the basis for our recent staff development training.  Each employee took the test online and then as a group we talked about the experience and offered feedback to one another.  Overall the information in this book is positively stated.  Employees felt validated and really excited about being seen in a positive light by one another. As the Vice President and leader of the sales team I thought the information in the book was valuable. Gaining awareness of the individual strengths represented within our work group gave me greater resources to work with in developing an effective team.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A fabulous collection of HD DVDs. The series ran on television and absolutely awed me, it took over 5 years I believe to create the whole collection of films. Makes me happy that the earth still has the green areas and parks that it does. Makes me want to take a picture of everything around me. Stay green!

140130916X|2.0|If you haven't picked this book up yet, here is my suggestion--go see the movie. The movie, which in my opinion was only loosely based on this novel, does for this story what the book could not, by taking out the mess of unneeded characters and plot points that Ms. Ahern seems to love.<br /><br />That said, Ms. Ahern takes 500+ pages to tell a story that probably could have been written much better in about 300 pages. As I mentioned above, there are many unneeded characters (especially Holly's many siblings), and I won't even go into how many chapters seemed to be dedicated to simple, terribly-written filler material.<br /><br />Also, the movie does a much better job at portraying a believable friendship/relationship between Holly and Daniel than the novel does, and the way their possible relationship ends up in the novel is just ridiculous, in my opinion.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I will keep this short and sweet and end it here by repeating what I originally stated--if you want a great portrayal of the general idea presented in this novel, go see the movie, because with this book you simply get a light and fluffy read that, considering the plot, should not be light and fluffy.

B000RPSVE0|5.0|I truly hope that this album is released in the US soon.  I resorted to buying the 320Kb MP3 download directly from DG's website; but I assure you that this warrents a much wider distribution.<br /><br />Anne Sofie von Otter is, I admit, my personal favorite singer.  She simply would not release anything that was not fabulous. But that is not why I love this release.<br /><br />This music stands, like other concentration camp music, as the ultimate statement of human will. In conditions as unbearable as those in Theresienstadt, men and woman survived by this music. It demonstrates human strength and the human ability to create beauty even from horror.<br /><br />The performances are impeccable; including really beautiful German and Yiddish diction, sensitivity, and technical skills. The music stands on it's own as Leider and Chamber Music, even exclusive of it's original environment. Together, they make for a very poignant tribute to the millions who perished in this time period.<br /><br />It is simply stunning.
B0000042H4|5.0|I love this set and wouldn't be without it and think the remastering is an improvement over the first generation CD release.  It is somewhat interesting that Decca hasn't re-mastered it further.    Anyway, interesting that Birgit Nilsson was never really that happy with the recording.  Her huge voice was somewhat scaled down by the engineers in favor of the orchestral detail and volume.  I heard Nilsson live enough to remember her never being drowned out by the orchestra.  In her autobiography, she felt better balance was struck with this release but she was so dissatisfied with the \\"Walkure\\" recording that she almost refused to have the recording released.  I actually prefer her performance in the complete live Bayreuth Ring on Phillips, conducted by Karl Bohm.  That's the Brunnhilde I remember.    The other problem with this set and this is really minor, considering the medium.  This music does not sound like this when heard in a theater or ever in concert.  The Decca engineers were out to make a big sonic bang with these operas, and they did.  The sound is incredible and if you try it on an iPOD, you'll be walking into walls.
B0000214F3|4.0|good film with great acting. this film leaves you feeling peaceful about death. Anthony Hopkins is a great actor and does so in the film also.
0723244049|5.0|I recently ordered this book from Amazon.com and was very happy with the book - especially for the price!    The book is breathtakingly beautiful and the slipcase makes it more of an heirloom item, rather than a simple book for young children.   This book is the complete works by Beatrix Potter and so much easier to read than the smaller books orginally published for small childrens' grip.      I would strongly recommend ALL parents of young children - as well as adults reminiscing of days gone by, to purchase this book and keep it in a place of prominence on your bookshelves.      I still can not get over the great price for such a wonderfully crafted book!
0143037757|5.0|This is a book that is one of those more broad spectrum, big picture trends books, as it is covering a large area of map, many countries and sixty years of european history after world war 2, starting with an assessment of what Europe was like prior to the Marshall plan.  It performs this job splendidly.  The author seems particularly adept at using specific example of countries during certain years and connecting it to the larger canvas.  Little countries as well as the bigger ones get to share the spotlight, a nice touch.  East and West (or, at least what used to be considered...) get their fair share of pages.  There are a lot of facts in this book, something which if you want to properly digest, takes a long time to read.  The last few chapters turn into more current events, which you may or may not be interested in.  At 800 pages of this, not an easy read, but well worth it if you want to understand where Europe has recently come from.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I just finished watching \\"Children of Men\\" and I'm still orienting all I saw within the questionable intelligence of my own mind.  I don't wish to give any spoilers so I'll try to avoid any retelling of the scenes in the film.    This film is dark, paranoid, and violent.  But, there is a well of hope that journeys through the terrible world.  Carried on by an unlikely hero (Clive Owen) the future has just been born.  With that future rides the hopes of all mankind.  Even as men are destroying one another that hope is still alive.  One day, perhaps, that hope will become peace to the world.    Children of men is one of the great cinematic achievements I've ever witnessed.  It is a bit slow and heavy during the first half as the story builds through a collection of the many political questions that exist in our own time and carries through to the ultimate puzzle of humanity: war.  The harshness of the backdrop perfectly sponsors the new hope.      I don't know if this film will garner any Oscar attention, but it darn well should.  It may have been the best film of 2007.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I think this is a really nice album; however, my only qualm with it is that there should have been more of a visit to the \\"Seconds Out\\" set list.  That is just my humble opinion; enjoy it!
0894803123|5.0|I was impressed with the book. I am anxious to taste one of these recipes. I gave this book, along with the Kitchenaid ice cream maker, to my son and his wife. They were very excited to receive these gifts for Christmas!
0525950079|5.0|Ok, so I read Pillars about 16 years ago.  When someone would ask for a favorite book, Pillars would be mentioned.  However, being that it was read so long ago, I must admit I didnt remember much of the details.  Well World Without End, took some time to ease into.  If it wasn't for my past love of Pillars I may have put the book down.  I would say it wasn't until about 150 pages in, that the love returned.  The characters came to life and I couldnt put the book down.    Sit back, relax and enter a new world-without end!
B000TLTVRS|5.0|The dishonorable Judge Turpin lusts after another man's wife. To gain her undivided attention, the judge sends her husband, Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), away; a life sentence for a bogus charge. Fifteen years later a ship docks in London carrying a man once-named Barker. He now goes by Sweeney Todd and he has come back to exact his revenge and find his wife and daughter. He returns to the space he once occupied to resume his work as a barber and forms a most peculiar relationship with Mrs. Lovett, whose meat pie shop sits beneath Todd's barber chair.<br /><br />The movie Sweeney Todd is based on Stephen Sondheim's musical which goes by the same name (and is in turn based on a 19th century legend of Sweeney Todd). Being that it is based on a musical, there is some conversation, but most intercourse is in song. For some, this will be the first hurdle to clear. But if you like musicals, the songs are fantastic and the signing was great. Johnny Depp really impressed me with his voice. And Ed Sanders, who plays Toby, was very very good.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd would be hard pressed to earn a nickname such as the \\"Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" without a little effort. His weapon of choice is the straight razor he uses in his barber practice. Get the men into his chair and slit their throats. This happens many times, and Director Tim Burton rivals most \\"B\\" horror flicks with the amount of blood in Sweeney Todd. This is the second, and final hurdle. If you can clear those two things, I hope you enjoy Sweeney Todd as much as I did.<br /><br />As mentioned already, I thought Johnny Depp's singing was really worth seeing. I think I will be so bold as to call this his best performance to date. And consider that I am as much of a Depp fan as most.<br /><br />I am not normally a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, but I will admit that I loved his cameo in Sweeney Todd; it was very funny.<br /><br />I was afraid that Tim Burton would take too much creative license and make it more like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but he did not. I loved the almost grainy feel to the film and the washed-out color, I thought it was perfect to capture the feeling of the movie.<br /><br />Despite the heavy blood flow, I really enjoyed Sweeney Todd. I thought Johnny Depp was great in the lead and he had very good support from Helena Bonham Carter and Ed Sanders. This is one of the best movies I have seen this year.t he did not.

0061120081|5.0|A great deal is made about the fact that Ms. Lee only wrote this one book, but when you write a classic how do you follow it?  Plus it has always added to her mystique, also she saw up close and personal how In Cold Blood destroyed Truman Capote.  She just went back to the small town she grew up in and has live a long and seemingly peaceful life.  The word classic is thrown around alot these days, but if the case of this book it fits.  Her writing style propels the book and the content resonates off the page.  It's really a story of a decent man defending a decent man, and in the process teaching his children what being a role model is all about.  As you read the text, you get the feeling Ms. Lee knows these people quite well, even she admits one of the characters is lose take on her childhood friend Truman.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read, it's a must read for the centuries.
B0000019PA|1.0|Not really any good or memorable songs and the clever, distorted alt-folk cliches really wear thin quickly. Some \\"songs\\" are almost unlistenable but boy, are they \\"alternative\\". Listen before buying. Or buy an Elliott Smith album, you get songs. With singing...
0143038419|2.0|I concur with the other few reviews that this book is not as great as I heard it was.  I heard rave reviews about this book at our Xmas book exchange party for our book club and was going to use it as my choice for the book club before I read it.  It does start to drag in the middle and the author comes across as very indecisive and annoying.  I had to put it down halfway through India.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Of the three new iTV films done as part of the Jane Austen Season this year, this one is my favorite (although it was really a toss-up with Northanger Abbey, this one wins for less content issues):  iTV Britain adapted the following to 90 minute TV films this year: Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, and this one I think is the best of the bunch.  Although short, this film packs most of the best bits of Jane Austen's `Persuasion', into a 90 minute easy-to-watch (though hardly accurate) period piece, taking this film `to the masses' as intended.       Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Frederick Wentworth are well cast, doing their parts justice: the others are mostly well cast, with a few exceptions (personally I found Mary Musgrove hard to take, the Musgrove sisters a bit too silly and Elizabeth Elliot a bit too old), and although I like this new adaptation, I think it cannot compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was extremely well cast and was just so beautifully done.  This new version is intended to bring Jane Austen to new audiences and I think it does so admirably.  It is beautifully shot and nicely costumed, and there are some very sweet and emotional moments that portray the books good points nicely.  I like the focus that this film has on the type of wife and characters IN a wife that Captain Wentworth is interested in, and how Anne is or isn't fitting into that idea at any given point.      Personally, one of my favorite things about this new `Persuasion' adaptation is the music (when it's there): the score that is part of this piece is very light, but mellow and haunting, sweet and melodious; I would love to purchase this music as a soundtrack CD, but haven't yet seen it available (nor I think, is it likely to be made so)...nonetheless, it is nicely done and worth paying attention to as you watch the film!      Content: there is not much objectionable with this film: there is mild innuendo, polite references to marriages and flirtations, but nothing much to give offense: all in all, a family-friendly film...    Yes, it's not entirely true to the book, yes, it's too short, yes, things have been changed, but the emotional swell created by the top-notch acting of Sally Hawkins, among others, as well as the build of the film and music, I think, pay off in the end: the end is short, too short for me, I will admit...the entire ending is summed into a quick few minutes in which everything is resolved that takes time to resolve in the book, but I still am happy to have this emotional and nicely-filmed version of Persuasion to add to the collection!
B000UBMZ4S|3.0|[[ASIN:B000UBMZ4S Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [HD DVD]]]    Well I thought I bought a 5 Disc Hd DvD set, But I actually bought a 3 Disc Hd DvD and a 2 Disc DvD. I feel a little Shafted here.  Film is Great HD Content is great but its a farce to call this a 5 disc HD DvD boxset.A bit disapointed in AMAZON for not pointing this out in its description.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Persuasion, Mansfield Park, and Northanger Abbey were all three done as 90 minute iTV adaptations this year, and Northanger Abbey I like second best, just behind Persuasion (it was a tough choice for me: read my review below and you may understand why).  I was so extremely thankful that someone had FINALLY undertaken to make a new version of Northanger Abbey!  (the 1986 version being so difficult to enjoy)...although I must say I sincerely wish they had undertaken to make a longer version, with less editing of the book, and more accuracy! [EDITED TO ADD: Northanger Abbey has definitely grown on me - it's become my favorite of the 3 listed above, and I watch it often: what a great film that pokes fun at the gothic romance obsession of Jane Austen's day: a delightful gem! The original uncut British/U.K. version is Region 2 and available on Amazon.co.uk, but you'll need a Region 2 player.]  On a trip to Bath Catherine Morland meets two men who immediately become interested in her romantically: Henry Tilney and John Thorpe.  Felicity Jones as Catherine Morland is a great choice: she is so sweet and innocent and yet imagines such dark and sensual goings on in her dreams as well as during her trip to Northanger Abbey, ancestral home of Henry Tilney (JJ Field).  The wild imaginings and fantasies of Catherine that are sparked by her love of gothic romances (novels), lead her down a path that may change the course of her future!  Content: there are some things to be aware of: mild swearing (few uses of d*mn), some cleavage shown, a scene were Catherine dreams of a man coming into her presence while she is in a bath (she takes his hand and leaves the bath), nothing shown; there is a scene where a woman is covered by sheets and it is implied that she and a young man have just had `relations' together; there are mentions of possible schemes & violence, which turn out to be untrue; there is a lot of sexual innuendo, and fantasies of swordfights, etc., but all in all it is kept to a fair minimum.  What a nice, new adaptation of Northanger Abbey!  Finally we have a halfway decent adaptation of this book to enjoy on the screen: I give them extra points for this alone, and then have to subtract some for things like the overtly sensual content and the switching of 'Udolpho' for 'The Monk', but really, I am just so pleased to have A VERSION of Northanger Abbey to watch on a regular basis (I'm sorry, I just can't very often stomach the older BBC version in this instance), I can almost forgive anything.  The casting is so well done and the story played out very well (with most all the key points, and I'll give them their 'errors' and omissions) that I must say bravo for a job FAIRLY well done!
0441013074|5.0|I've never read anything quite like Alistair Reynolds's astonishing \\"Century Rain.\\" A noir whodunnit that turns into a spy chase that turns into a space opera of epic proportions, it's set several centuries from now, where the Earth has suffered some sort of biological castrophe instigated by the law of unintended consequences. It features two competing human factions, the Threshers (essentially preservationists) and the Slashers (the techies--themselves divided into two factions) who are at odds.<br /><br />At first, most of the action takes place on an alternate earth, E2 (one of the characters speculates it's a backup of our earth), preserved in quantum amber, that diverged from our earth in 1940, when Hitler's invasion of France was stopped by the French (Hitler is seen briefly as a sick wheelchair-bound aging prisoner). As a result, the technological advances instigated by WWII never happened here, where it is now a technologically stagnant 1959.<br /><br />The first quarter or so of the book is told from two different points of view in alternate chapters. In one sequence, we follow Thresher Verity Auger, who's sent via wormhole transport to this E2 in order to learn what happened to one of their agents, Susan White. We know, however, that she has either fallen or been pushed off a balcony. We know this because:<br /><br />The other POV is that of a local private eye named Wendell Floyd, who moonlights as a jazz musician. He takes the case after the Paris police seem uninterested in learning whether White jumped or was pushed, but her landlord-friend is, and hires Floyd to investigate. Finally, Auger and Floyd meet, the POVs merge, and the story tumbles off.<br /><br />Mr. Reynolds, whose Revelation Space series speculated brilliantly on a high-tech future, this time tries to re-create a mid-20th-century space opera (maybe you'll have fun figuring out where John W. Campbell would have placed the \\"continued next month\\" break if he'd serialized this in \\"Analog\\") all the while riffing on scientific knowledge of today. The craft that goes through the wormhole, for example, features pistons and analog dials that glow red when what they measure is dangerous, and green when they're safe. And the Threshers communicate via p-mail--printed paper sent via pneumatic tubes (eventually you'll learn why).<br /><br />After Auger and Floyd meet, there's much snappy noir dialogue, and various secrets are revealed during a chase sequence. (There are many chase sequences.) It's great fun; it's meant to be enjoyed, but probably not analyzed.<br /><br />This is a standalone, but there are enough loose ends for a sequel, if Mr. Reynolds is so inclined.fic knowledge of today.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|My friends know that one of my passions is the book Jane Eyre. It is one of those stories that you have to read in school, and while most, forgot about it and moved on to the next book, it stayed in my heart.<br />The first time I saw the movie based on Jane Eyre, was on TV  with Joan Fontaine as Jane and the handsome Orson Welles as Rochester. I thought it a very accurate version of the book.<br />Since then, there have been many a try at Jane Eyre - why? Because it is such a mystical quality to it, that it captures your fancy and you want to learn more and see more.<br />Then I saw the repeat of the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre version starring Toby Stephens as Rochester and Ruth Wilson as the adult Jane Eyre.<br />When I looked at Toby as Rochester, I forgot every other version I ever saw...He is THE BEST Rochester I have seen, with expressive eyes that tell of the pain and loneliness and hardships he has had.<br />The only part of this new classic was they injected some occult games in it - Rochester had his guests play on an early form of a Ouija Board, and he has a gypsy come and tells all the guests' fortunes - including Jane. But Jane didn't fall for the gypsy knowing facts about her, and Rochester reveals himself to her.<br />The interesting part about the occult, is the book DOES touch on it - as Rochester calls Jane through the miles - 'Jane - Jane Eyre' -<br />She knows it's him and he is in trouble - ESP...<br />This production is a new classic and has the best Rochester I have seen.<br />Will never read the book without seeing Toby Stephens' face...<br />Excellent!!

This is a great set with all of his seventies songs from his last concerts and studio songs with him and the boys sitting around and playing and singing. This is a great compilation of his music and a good variety from rock to country.  I listened all day to these 5 CD's on his birthday.  It also comes with a great book to see pictures of him and it tells where the concerts were and what he was singing.  A great set!
1401300529|4.0|Could the Title be a play on words to bring to mind \\"The Longest Day\\"?    As someone previously mentioned this is not a concise history of the entire Korean War(a war my dad and two uncles fought in), rather the title says it all:it's a History of the political and military manuvers made by the US and Communists in the Winter of 1950-51.    It is really the story of the Downfall of General Douglas McArthur and President Harry Truman.  McArthur by placing too much confidence in his own inerrancy and proficiency as a Commander not once but twice ignored signals of impending disaster when he ignored the North Korean buildup in the Summer of 1950 and then again maintained that the Chinese would never intervene to save Kim's forces after Inchon reversed the tide.    Truman's State department left a lot to be desired when it left South Korea out of the spere of US influence in Asia emboldening Kim's resolve to invade.  Truman's lack of control over McArthur made things worse as the General frequently told Washington one thing while at the same time he was doing another.  Had Truman managed to allay Red Chinese fears over American support of Taiwan or get McArthur to stop short of his goal of driving to the Yalu River border we might have seen the War end two years early but we would still have the same stalemate we see today.    Truman's sack of McArthur at Wake Island ended the General's career but effectively sealed his fate as to the 1952 election.  Like candidates today and in 1968 Einsenhower campaigned on an end the Other Party's War Platform and won the election.    The book has several eyewitness accounts of events from interviews with surviving veterans and from the correspondances of those lost in battle or who have become deceased.  We can see the desparation of young americans fighting the severe cold without proper winter clothes(left in Seoul cause the brass thought the war was over just before the Chinese attacked) against wave after wave of desparate enemies.  Thir story is the real heart of \\"The Coldest Winter\\".    I think the book is a good starting point for understanding the events and policies that lead to the war and the politics both military and Civil that shaped its outcome.
0553381695|5.0|The plot is intriguing. The characters are varied and interesting. I love that even the \\"villains\\" are sympathetic and, as Mister SJEMP says, that even heroes can die. There's a lot of violence, but unlike in so much other fantasy, it doesn't feel gratuitous.     If you like epic fantasy and prefer your characters shaded rather than black or white, you should love this book.
B0010X745K|3.0|\\"The Mist\\" is the latest Stephen King adaptation to hit the big screen and I have to say it is one of the better recent attempts. The monsters are cool, particularly the ones you never really get to see (more on that later), and the characters make up your usual bunch of hateful idiots, hapless victims, and relatable protagonists. And then there's the ever-popular religious zealot; every town has at least one, but what happens when all hell breaks loose and people start believing them? Now THAT is scarier than any monster! The story is classic King through-and-through with splashes of George Romero ([[ASIN:B00005Y6Y2 Night of the Living Dead]] and the like) and an awful ending that will baffle you in it's sudden abandonment of any and all logic in an attempt to be dark and ironic. There's much good, but there's some major bad in there that soured the brew for me.<br /><br />As the mysterious mist rolls over the small town and shoppers are trapped in the store, the tension builds exceptionally well. As usual, it doesn't take long for the masses to begin to fragment into opposing factions: the obnoxiously intellectual pig-headed sorts who refuse to admit that anything is wrong, the rednecks (gotta have the rednecks!), the aforementioned religious fanatics assuring us that the End of Days has come, and the sensible folk who keep their heads about them and take it as it comes.  Not so many of them it turns out. There is a satisfying amount of mystery about what exactly is in the mist and that tension works well, but once night falls and the beasties arrive in force, it's mostly gung-ho from there. The monsters themselves are creepy and otherworldy enough, but -like I said before- the ones that really worked for me are the ones you never get a clear shot of. It's been said over and over again that less is more, but with the advent of CG, filmmakers tend to forget that.<br /><br />Like Romero's classics, this isn't really a film about man versus monsters; it's about man versus man. No matter the situation, humans will always be petty, selfish, and ultimately violent creatures in need of control. Like [[ASIN:B00005O06X Lord of the Flies]] and many others before and since, \\"The Mist\\" assures us that civility will only last so long we are surrounded by civilization. As one character infers: turn off the lights, take away life's little necessities, put some people in an enclosed space, then scare them and you've got a recipe for violent insanity. It's been said through film over and over, but that message always rises above the happy-ending, everybody sticks together, sugar-coated garbage that is so often rammed down our throats by Hollywood. This is probably the film's best quality once the mysteries are exposed.<br /><br />\\"The Mist\\" is a good film that settles in as a solid Stephen King adaptation that is diminished by a few bad decisions. The worst decision of all is the changing of the original ending which was left open to audience interpretation in the novella. That's what brings this otherwise solid fright flick down more than anything: a lazy, poorly thought out \\"eff you\\" to the audience that is supposed to bring closure, but only manages to abandon all logic and make the entire film seem less good than it is.

Like [[ASIN:B00005O06X Lord of the Flies]] and many others before and since, \\"The Mist\\" assures us that civility will only last so long we are surrounded by civilization. As one character infers: turn off the lights, take away life's little necessities, put some people in an enclosed space, then scare them and you've got a recipe for violent insanity. It's been said through film over and over, but that message always rises above the happy-ending, everybody sticks together, sugar-coated garbage that is so often rammed down our throats by Hollywood. This is probably the film's best quality once the mysteries are exposed.     \\"The Mist\\" is a good film that settles in as a solid Stephen King adaptation that is diminished by a few bad decisions. The worst decision of all is the changing of the original ending which was left open to audience interpretation in the novella.

B000EOTAM6|1.0|Basically this movie promotes a heroine who practices genocide against her own people by deliberatly severing the only lifeline that her entire species has to survival.  Shortly after this, amongst heaps of praise for her unexcusable decision, the movie ends as though all is now well.  The main villain has been a psycho running around murdering pregnant women.  The main charecter is suposedly this great, pure person, but she takes his crimes soooo much further by eliminating her species.    All in all, a terrible movie!  The designers seemed to have been promoting her sickening actions too which is perhaps the worst of it, that they condone the murder-suicide of the entire human species.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|Originally I wanted to watch this show because of one particular person in the show. Now that I have watched Season One and keeping up with Season Two I have gotten more interested in the show.
B00006AFF5|1.0|All I can remember about this awful movie is being disapointed at every turn.  The constant bending and revision of the original story-line, the unlikable poorly done charecters, the terrible acting, etc.  Really not a movie that I would recommend.  The book is much better, best to stick to that and forget this sorry excuse.    If I could give it zero stars instead of one I would, but apparantly amazon will allow one as the lowest possible rating.
B0002CHIJW|3.0|Obviously this film isn't for everybody. If you're interested in seeing it it's because you want to see something controversial that pushes boundaries. Something you won't see in most other films. This movie should satisfy those desires. We all know what it's about so I won't go into that. There are three seperate rape scenes all taking place within about an hour. These scenes are fairly graphic and pretty real. I think her trauma is more mental as the men don't really beat on her until the final rape. In carrying out her revenge she actually allows one of the men to have sex with her before she kills him. That seemed strange to me but it was a good scene. The best scene to me is the scene in the bathtub. Again she gains one of the men's trust and gets in the bathtub with him. Then after making him feel very good she does something very bad! They way the actors played this scene out seemed very real to me. I think the mans reaction is pretty spot on.    In some other reviews I've read this movie described as disturbing and being compared to \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"Last House on the Left\\". I didn't think this movie was at all distubing. Maybe it might be for women. It's nothing like \\"TCM\\"! That movie is disturbing! And it's way better than \\"Last House on the Left\\" Which I didn't like at all. So all in all if this movie appeals to you then I think it is definitely worth checking out.
0761145613|5.0|This calendar has been a lifesaver in our household for 4 years now. It clearly allows us to see all the activities scheduled for each day for each person. I like how I can use one calendar for the entire school year and how each family member has a column. All I have to do is look at each day's row to plan the day.<br />Since my kids are older now, I don't use the stickers, but they would be fun for smaller kids to use. The illustrations are funny and there is plenty of room to write in each space.<br />I recommend this calendar highly for busy families!
B0011NVC98|1.0|I didn't buy \\"Beowulf\\" for one minute.<br /><br />Director Robert Zemeckis, who built his career making enjoyable films like \\"Back to the Future\\", \\"Romancing the Stone\\" and \\"Forrest Gump\\", has been exploring the realm of computer animated films recently. He has even gone so far as to develop new technology so he can more convincingly capture actors portraying the characters he then has animated. His first foray into this field was \\"The Polar Express\\" in which Tom Hanks played a number of characters and all of the children in the film looked like soulless zombies. In \\"Monster House\\", the technology was used to better effect because the characters were highly stylized and looked like animated characters. They weren't trying to be real, so we buy into the scenario more readily. Now with \\"Beowulf\\", Zemeckis' uses Ray Winston, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn, Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich to portray various characters in this completely computer generated universe. The characters look like the actors playing them, but they still move with the jerky movements common to video game characters and they still have that soulless zombie look in their eyes. My question is if you are going to go to the trouble to try to make Ray Winston look like Ray Winston (with the use of a body double), and Angelina Jolie look like Angelina Jolie, why not just use the actors in front of animated backgrounds, ala \\"Sin City\\" or \\"300\\"?<br /><br />It's strange that Zemeckis, who began his career making such fun and enjoyable films, starring personable actors (Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner) now chooses to make completely lifeless films using a technology replacing the very likable actors with pale facsimiles of themselves (Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright Penn).<br /><br />The story begins with a party in a remote Danish kingdom. King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) are having a celebration, but the king has become very inebriated and seems to disgust his younger wife. Their merriment causes the great beast Grendel (Crispin Glover) to awake, his head pounding with the noise, a noise he must stop, so he attacks the village, killing many. Distraught, Hrothgar hopes for a miracle and promises his kingdom to whoever can slay Grendel. Enter Beowulf (Ray Winston and a body double). Beowulf treks to Grendel's lair and slays him, but now he has to deal with Grendel's mother, a dangerous beast who takes the form of a beautiful woman (Angelina Jolie) who vows revenge. She tempts Beowulf and they eventually battle. When Beowulf returns, Hrothgar makes him king, as promised, and gives him Wealthow as his wife. Then Beowulf must deal with other forces.<br /><br />Much like \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300\\", the use of computer animation is a really great method of recreating a land and time long ago. In this case, the filmmakers use this technology to create the remote, snowy Danish vistas of yesteryear. And the work is interesting to look at. Remote huts and community buildings look interesting and add some interest to the story. These same sets would cost a fortune to recreate and would probably not look as authentic as they do in this film, so creating them with CGI is a necessity.<br /><br />But because much of this film takes place in caves, or on snowy plains, the film retains a `cartoony' look, resembling a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Really, some of the scenes in the film look like the background keeps repeating. This is not a good thing when a film is trying to be hyper-realistic.<br /><br />Zemeckis has spent a lot of time developing technology to make this type of filmmaking more realistic. Basically, they put an actor in a suit covered with tiny transmitters. They film the actor acting out a scene. They import the scene into a computer and the computer tracks these tiny emitters as the actor moves. This allows the animator to add clothes, costumes, backgrounds, while the movement of the character remains `natural'. Zemeckis has developed this technology to add facial expressions to the mix, something they were previously only able to do in limited doses. Unfortunately, it didn't work very well in \\"Polar Express\\", making all the children resemble zombies. In \\"Monster House\\", it was better. In \\"Beowulf\\", the facial expressions are a bit blank again. The characters certainly look like the actors they are playing, but the expressions seem a little off, the eyes a little vacant. I really think this has to do with the fact these are real actors playing the characters. The technology seemed to work in \\"Monster House\\", but that was because the characters were less realistic and cartoonier. In the two films where the characters are supposed to be more realistic, they appear more like avatars in a video game. Speaking of avatars, James Cameron is reportedly developing his own technology for his next film, \\"Avatar\\", due in 2009.<br /><br />Equally important are the character's body movements. In \\"Beowulf\\", the characters seem to move stiffly and even in a jittery fashion at some points. It just isn't convincing and makes everything seem more like a videogame. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was an ad for a Wii game.<br /><br />Okay, let's put these things aside for a moment and address the story. The main conflict, the battle between Anjelina Jolie's character and Ray Winstone's happens in the second act. This leaves a lot of time, too much time, for the story to meander and try to paint a picture of Beowulf and a younger woman (Allison Lohman) having an affair, while Wealthow (Penn) looks on. Yawn. Then, the filmmakers seem to realize they need to have a climatic ending and throw in another battle. At this point, it just makes the film seem long. Too long.<br /><br />The 3-D technology has improved greatly. Disney is doing some interesting things with this technology and has made a new film \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" and re-released \\"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" with this technology. These new films look like they are truly 3-D, gone are the lines and shadows we used to have when this technology was first introduced in the mid 50s. There was a trailer for the first live-action 3-D film using this technology, next summers \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" starring Brendan Fraser. It looks like an interesting idea, but the clips they showed in the trailer make the actors look flat as they traverse a 3-D landscape, much like the characters in Zemeckis' \\"Polar Express\\" and \\"Beowulf\\".<br /><br />Film wouldn't be where it is today without filmmakers experimenting and creating things like Panavision, THX, Roadshow presentations, 3-D and CGI to enhance their own films. Because of these advancements, we have had the pleasure of watching new films that could one day be considered classics, films like \\"Sin City\\", \\"300\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\". Without the development of the water creature in \\"The Abyss\\", we would never have had the amazing special effects used to create the Terminator in \\"Terminator 2.\\" In a way, the work of Ray Harryhausen on films like \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\\" led to the amazing special effects used in \\"The Matrix\\". It seems difficult at this point to imagine, but perhaps, perhaps, one day the work Zemeckis is currently putting into these films and this technology may one day lead to some enjoyable, memorable films.<br /><br />But right now, we have \\"Beowulf\\", which is anything but.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Strangely enough, this is the first BP album i've bought. Have always been a fan but never bought his stuff. I was actually taken aback by some of the negative reviews here and hesitated to buy this. But i did, and am certainly not disappointed. This is a very good album, heck its actually one of the best i have and probably one of the best of '07. The first 7 songs are aboslutely spot on... awesome stuff. I've actually been disappointed by some other big name albums that came out around the same time (Eagles, Mark Knopfler, Plant/Krauss), but thats just my opinion. And my opinion on this is... get this album, it truly is good. All the songs are catchy, great lyrics and hooks and choruses that you could really sing to. A great driving album! Awesome stuff.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|This Santana CD is great because it contains the best known Santana pieces, especially \\"Smooth\\" which, in my opinion is the best he ever did. His old classics are also welcome.    For anyone who enjoys Santana's music, I recommend this album highly.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and it was good. I then saw a glimpse of it on a Blu-Ray demo disc and my jaw dropped on the quality of the picture and also don't forget the killer sound as well.    For $19.99 its the best Blu-Ray picture/sound quality I have seen/heard PERIOD.
B000002L1L|3.0|There is some very good songs on this cd, the title track is one of them.  Anya is another great song and Ramhackle Man but other are not as good as we are use to with Deep Purple, like Lick it up or One man's meat.  Overall, this is a good addition to your rock cd collection but for sure this one is not the best from the band.
0743298039|5.0|There were some strange circumstances surrounding my reading of this book. It was listed in an email ad I received I thought that it sounded interesting. A few days later, someone mentioned it on an email list that I'm on and I became even more interested in reading it. Then I went home and found it sitting on top of a box of books in my living room. I have no idea how it got there, nor does anyone in my family.    So you would think that when I read the book it had some deep hidden meaning that I was just meant to read! Well, no. But it was a really, really good book that I would recommend to anyone who love a brooding, gothic-type mystery. And its setting of the main character in the world of antiquarian books was especially interesting for a book lover like me.    Margaret Lea is summoned to the home of a famous author whose life has been shrouded in mystery and who is known for telling far-fetched stories about her past. Vida Winter asks Margaret to write her biography, but Margaret is skeptical of the author's claim that she wants to tell the truth at last. As the story unfolds, however, Margaret is drawn in. As the plot moved between the telling of the story and Margaret's efforts to corroborate it with visits to the author's childhood home, I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat as I feverishly flipped the pages.    The Thirteenth Tale deals with secrets and their revelation and whether truth really does set people free. A very pleasant and satisfying read.
B000065U1N|5.0|~Black Hawk Down~ was Director Ridley Scott's masterful cinematic remake of the little known 1993 American Special Forces intervention in Somalia, under the auspices of that corrupt, ineffective organization we affectionately know as the United Nations. On June 5, 1993, 24 Pakistani UN peacekeepers were ambushed and killed in an area of Mogadishu, controlled by Aidid. On June 6, the United Nations Security Council issued a toothless Resolution 837 calling for the arrest and trial of those responsible for the ambush. The U.S. Government answered the call. Operation Gothic Serpent, was authorized with the purpose of hunting down and capturing the Islamic leader and warlord of Somalia, Muhammad Farrah Aidid. With an economy in shambles, the warlords reigned supreme, using the relief given from international humanitarian relief programs as a spoils system to buy influence and power. The conversation between one of the warlord's henchman and an American officer was particularly foreboding: \\"Do you think if you get General Aidid,\\" queried Abdullah Hassan, \\"we will simply put down our weapons and adopt American democracy? That the killing will stop? We know this. Without victory, there will be no peace. There will always be killing, see? This is how things are in our world.\\" Like the book, by Mark Bowden mentioned, you realize why that Mogadishu was nicknamed \\"the Black Sea\\" by the American G.I.'s that were dispatched there. Those beleaguered outnumbered American soldiers learned how fleet-footed they could be when chased down the streets by Somali mobs welding AK-47s and machetes.     Whether it was intended to, or not, (which I doubt it was,) this is a powerful anti-war film against American interventionism abroad. I for one have empathy for the American G.I. and the sacrifices they make, but also would like to see them alive and well in the U.S. And as one soldier said in the film, \\"Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics just goes right out the window.\\" Intervention beget more intervention in this sad tale. Americans were trapped and pinned down. Then Blackhawks and more troops were called in for support. Then those Blackhawks were shot down. Then more troops were sent into rescue the rest. 'Leave no man behind,' was an honorable U.S. Army tradition, as well it should be, but I am apt to reflect on the futility of sending so many men into a futile battle in the first place. People can boast about the Army's superior kill ratios, but the 'Mog' as it was nicknamed, is but a microcosm of our government's present costly, futile war in Iraq which commenced in 2003. America's history of twentieth-century military victories are often Pyrrhic victories, or those battles won at too great a cost. In the case of Aidid, he was never captured, and there was no strategic victory. He died a few years later.    In 1983, after the tragic bombing of the Marine barracks, then President Ronald Reagan rightly condemned it as a \\"despicable attack,\\" but ultimately came to affirm the futility of American intervention in the Middle East: \\"Perhaps we didn't appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the Middle East such a jungle. Perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to Paradise was so foreign to our own values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the Marines' safety that it should have. In the weeks immediately after the bombing, I believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave. Yet the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics forced us to rethink our policy there. If there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die, we would be a lot better off. If that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality, those 241 Marines would be alive today.\\" Analogous thinking could be applied to Mogadishu or Baghdad.     The most mesmerizing part of the entire film is when the idealist Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (played by Josh Harnett) talks to his fallen comrade on a morgue table: \\"A friend of mine asked me before I got here, 'Why are y'all going to fight someone else's war. What do y'all think you are heroes?' I didn't know what to say at the time. But, if you ask me again, I'd say No. I'd say there is no way in hell. Nobody asks to be a hero, it just sometimes turns out that way.\\"
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is a French dish of stewed vegetables that plays a delicious role in resolving the plot of this movie, thanks to a remarkable rat called Remy. Remy is a quintessential foodie. He raids shelves for saffron, picks fresh mushrooms, and watches his favorite chef on television, Auguste Gusteau, the deceased owner of the famous Parisian restaurant of the same name. But there's heat in that famous French kitchen after it's taken over by a new, very mean, owner after a bad review. Much to the horror of the new owner, Skinner, did Gusteau really leave the restaurant to his son and dish washer, Linguini? What will become of the romance between Linguini and the sous chef Collete? Will Remy ever reconcile with his family who can't understand why he's not satisfied to eat out of the garbage and serve them as their poison checker? Will the humans ever accept a rat in the kitchen? What will that imperious food critic, Anton Ego, think of Remy's dish of ratatouille? And just how will Remy, Collete and Linguini live happily ever after? Grab the family one Friday night, pop some popcorn, and tee up this great film to find out.
0064430227|5.0|My cousin is having her first child and as I am much older and my children are grown I thought it would be a neat gift for each one of them to choose a few of their favorite childhood books to buy and send in a package to her for the new arrival. As a teacher I could have picked many, but I wanted to choose one that still inspires my little ones now. Every year my new students love to hear about Harold's adventures and make purple journals of their own and draw where they would like to visit themselves with purple crayons. This simple but timeless story always has been dear to me and continues to fascinate my students year after year.
0307275639|5.0|What an excellent, thought provoking little book. I mention this book to lots of different people I meet up with (I live in Australia)and invariably EVERYONE knows of it or has read it. Not one person has had a negative thing to say about this book. It is so EASY to read and so HARD to put down!!!! I am a busy mum with 3 boys and still I HAD to READ this BOOK ONCE I STARTED IT!!!! What a great reflector it was, even for me in my busy life. Puts many things back into perspective. Grab a copy today and challenge yourself.
1592332803|5.0|I just got this cookbook for Christmas and I already love it. The author uses \\"regular\\" ingredients so even a non-vegan baker can easily use this book. Most of the recipes are very simple and are quite delicious. Even the \\"basic\\" chocolate cake is pretty special, and took me about 10 minutes to put together, with ingredients that I already stock in my pantry. This book is a must-have for bakers of all kinds, vegan or not.
0805079831|5.0|This should be required reading for every American who is planning to vote in the next election--although I fear that Friedman-style corporatism has permeated all the candidates. Klein's book is extremely well researched and documented, and it reveals the dotted-line connections among government authorities, neoliberal economists, and corporations that are not discussed by the mainstream media--largely because they are themselves part of the problem! I had always wondered how the press, so quick to speak up about injustice, fraud, and corruption in 1970s, had been coopted so totally and attributed it to bullying from the White House--no praise, no access. But it's much worse--the same corporations that own the media also own the war and surveillance technologies and the disaster-relief industries for which disasters become business as usual. This oligarchy is so entrenched that it may well be too late to evict it without worldwide revolution, but in any event knowledge is far superior to ignorance on these scores.

B000PY52EU|4.0|We meet two people, under unusual circumstances, who seemingly have nothing in common early in the film and watch them create an unbreakable bond between each other.  Lazarus is middle aged, black man with unsteady employment and passion for blues (he plays guitar and sings in a local bar).  Ray on the other hand is pettite, blond, promiscuous young woman without a clear direction in her life.  As Ray gets badly beaten one day, she is found by Lazarus outside of his home who quickly discovers her insatiable taste for sex with any man that happens to be around. To teach her a lesson, Lazarus chains her to the radiator in attempt to force her self-realization and at the same time redeem himself from pain he feels after being abandoned by his wife of many years who leaves him for his younger brother.  In spite of constant thugging between these two and Ray's unsuccessful attempts to seduce Lazarus in order to \\"free\\" herself from his chains these two create a strong bond without ever kissing each other.  This is multi-layered, deeply emotional film that requires exploration who we are, why are we are the way we are and what external influences shape our personality and life decisions.  Christina Ricci is wonderful in this strong performance.  Her southern accent, big eyes and body language are amazing that make her performance flawless.  Music in the film is wonderful.  It is surprising to learn that Justin Timberlake (in a role of Ray's anxiety attack prone boyfriend) can act and he is quite good at it too. As for Samuel Jackson - he will not let you down.
B000M06KFC|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs of all time. I had lost this CD and finally bought a new copy after several years. I am not a blues connaisseur, but find this ubelievably moving, sensual, sexy music. Johnny has a beautiful voice and delivery. I am hooked (no pun intended! :)), and will be buying more of his music.
1581806574|4.0|Was swayed to buy this book by the reviews... Amazon offers several! Well done ~ does a fairly good job of explaining the basics, and the step-by-step was helpful to me. Not geared for the very young, though... would suggest from the 10-12yr. range & up.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|98% of the songs on this cd are such a comfort to me. Especially In Repair. But there are more songs than that one actually and the two songs I haven't heard yet - I haven't heard because I keep pressing rewind on the rest of the songs... it's personal maybe it's just me - but John has been going thru life and this cd has a very old soul.  \\"Fear is your friend that's misunderstood\\" I think that's what he sings - that one line says more than all the climbing to the mountain top to find the answers to the meaning of life could ever tell you. Ok that's all I can say because its personal again... I am taking John to heart on this one.
0689859414|5.0|I purchased this book for my 8 year old son.  He loves Spiderwick and is facinated with the \\"real\\" look of the guide.  Some of the writing requires concetration to read since it is in Arther Spiderwicks own handwriting.  Fun illustrations of the creatures from the unseen world.
B00005JPTI|3.0|OK, here's the deal. I never read the book, I didn't care about the plot or who was acting, I just wanted to see how the movie depicted post-apocalyptic New York. I'm probably a bit older than a lot of posters so my visual acuity may leave something to be desired, but I enjoyed the scenes of a weed-covered, delapidated, once-great city. Then I found myself enjoying Will Smith's acting. Then I found myself interested in the plot. Had fun cringing as the vampirical mutants menaced the last remnants of civilization.  But then...(SPOILER ALERT)...    The Brazilian lady and the boy showed up. Right there and then, the whole thing tanked. They were totally out of place and completely interrupted the flow of the film. What really got me was the conversation where the woman keeps insisting there's a survivor colony in Vermont, and Legend keeps telling her that's crazy. Finally he says: \\"How do you know there's *anything* left anywhere at all?\\" [paraphrase].    Her: \\"God told me.\\"  Me: \\"WTF????\\"    That was just so all wrong. First we're in a post-Armageddon, deserted wasteland, devoid of all hope, then we're watching an episode of *The 700 Club*? What's wrong with that picture? What's even wronger is that Legend ends up believing the Deity-channeling woman, and that she somehow knows without a map just how to get to the survivor colony. C'mon, how much more contrived and heavy-handed could you get? That just blew it all to H3ll for me. Nothing seemed believable after the woman and boy showed up. That's unfortunate because the beginning of the movie had a lot of promise. I would rent the DVD to watch with someone who'd never seen it, but I wouldn't buy it, and I'd have to attach a lot of caveats to recommend it to a friend. Next time someone does a remake, I hope they leave the religious claptrap out of it. It would have been a much sharper, more focused movie without it.
0446677450|2.0|This book beats common sense issues to a bloody pulp causing the reader to want to pull his or her hair out.  I read through this entire book just because I bought it and didn't want to waste my money.  He has a lot of beneficial things that should be done if one wants to become financially secure.  Some of the main things that ruined the book for me was him saying how he turned $5000 into a million dollars extremely easy and in a very short time.  He also puffs seminars and other things that people like him profit off of.  This book is probably good for someone in middle school that needs to get topics pounded into their heads.  If you are financially retarded buy this book and try and sift through the impossible advice and the logical advice...You'll go crazy.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Please, please, everyone, listen.  If you've never seen the Godfather trilogy, stop what you're doing and watch it now.  Honestly, they are brilliant, beautiful, moving, suspenseful, and they encompass pretty much everything that a movie should be.  Part I and Part II are flawless.  Part III had a few holes and was a bit more \\"overdone,\\" but it was still a great movie.
0060254920|5.0|I bought this for my 3-year-old son for Christmas. I like to get my kids at least one nice hardback book each holiday season, and I scanned amazon for the top picks. My son is infatuated with all things monster so when I came upon this one, I knew it was the one. It did not disappoint. He has asked for it at bedtime every night since he got it and enjoys \\"reading\\" it along with me.
1400032717|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is a captive novel focusing on the life of a teenage kid called Christopher.  One night, he finds a dog named Wellington dead in his neighbor's yard and he starts investigating who the mystery killer could be.  In doing so, Christopher finds out more about his past and present that he ever knew and it changes his whole life forever. This novel is an intriguing story that leads you to conclusions you would have never thought of before.  I liked this book because of the author's unique writing style. He made the book interesting by switching between the past and the present, which helped to better explain Christopher's life.  Also Mark Haddon the author of this book used many different pictures, diagrams and tables to explain the story and to further develop Christopher's characteristics.  And the most interesting thing that the author does is he writes in the perspective of the child, Christopher's by writing out his thoughts to the audience and by writing like how a child would. It adds a depth to the story that would be missing without it.  Lastly I thoroughly enjoy this book because it holds many different mysteries around every corner and is unexpected at many parts.  I like Haddon's style of writing because it is modern and unique.  This is one of the best written books I have read in a long time and is a refreshing read because of its unique and out of the box style of writing.  I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to read something new and modern.  I would also recommend this book to people above the age of 13 because of mild language throughout the book. Overall this book is a fantastic read with vivid realism throughout the novel.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This Disney Classic is classic for a reason.  The songs are the best, the characters are loveable, and Prince Eric is actually hot.<br /><br />I rewatched it at 21 for the first time in about 15 years and I still sung along to \\"Part of Your World\\", felt her anguish in \\"Part of Your World Reprise\\" and cried at the end.  Now that's good entertainment
B00008RWAX|5.0|While some have hailed Mr. Mandela as \\"The Greatest Statesman of the 20th Century,\\" I feel grossly inadequate in making such a claim (being an American who has never lived in South Africa).

B00062RCBW|3.0|If you purchase the set entitled \\"The Chosen Collection\\", just be aware that it is not going to be anywhere near perfect.<br /><br />All the discs are in a booklet of plastic sleeves. There is no episode listing anywhere, so if you are looking for an episode in particular, you'll just have to know what season it was in, then make your best guess as to which disc it might be on. Also, as soon I opened the booklet the plastic sleeves fell out. They were not even bound to the cardboard cover.<br /><br />I was also annoyed by the packaging in general. What does that big prominent \\"2\\" on the front of the box mean? Is it indicating that it's the second Star Trek series? Also, there are a few typos on the box, along with the fact that the back of box states that it is in \\"Widescreen format\\", which it is not. The main printing on the back of the box says something like \\"New Crew. New Adventures... (something like that, I don't have the box in front of me). So there's this list of like 20-30 actor's names, none of which I have ever heard of aside from Patrick Stewart. If any of those people were on the show, they were extras or something.<br /><br />I guess all the weirdness of the packaging can be attributed to the fact that this is the \\"international version\\" (or so I have since read).  All I know for sure is that I think I would have rather had the more recent Paramount release with the discs in the cheap green trays.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the price was reasonable, and at least now I can watch the show whenever I want (and I don't have to look at the packaging if I don't want to!). Just be aware of what you are getting yourself into with this version of the release.<br /><br />edit: January 22, 2008<br />So far after getting 6 discs into the series, 2 of the discs will not play on my DVD player.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|I really don't see much wrong about this recording! Sure,the guys are alittle older now,but if you happen to have the songs that are on this recording on another recording done by the same guys,you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy and hear alittle bit of an updated version of that same music!( the only thing I put a mark on is Phil Collins using the \\"F\\" word in the song 'Invisible Touch' )  - He didn't need to do that! -<br />  But overall,you will notice more drumming in the songs done and its very enjoyable to have playing on your cd player! ( I skip 'Invisible Touch' completely now because of the word used by Phil - and I'm a Phil Collin's fan to boot ) I wish he would have remained that 'clean Phil' during that song and left the dirty language back where it came from!<br />  Anyway,its good to see the guys back in action again and I hope that they won't stay away to long until they make another recording! ( but I think that might be 1 of those wonderful dreams we all have )<br />  Go get a copy and enjoy alittle ride from the past,brought up to date with the guys!!!
B000A2XC1C|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl after it first came out. It was and always will be my favorite Christmas movie. There's just something about it that takes you back to when you were a child. This is the way children should think Santa Claus lived. It's perfect!

B000YXMMAE|5.0|I'd like to have heard Hail to the Thief before this to have the full context of the style arc they've followed from The Bends to where they are now, but it's still nice to hear them sound more natural and rock-like than the still-good but less endearing electronic stuff they got into.  In Rainbows is sort of a mix of the two styles.  Ok Computer was already leaning in that direction, so In Rainbows is a sort of bridge that makes the whole band a bit more seamless in terms of style.  \\"Creep\\" still sounds way different from \\"Pyramid Song\\", but you can see where they came from.  In Rainbows can be characterized by a rise and fall of tension without too many complete releases happening.  There are some moments, but most of the enjoyment comes from the routine building blocks of the songs, which are just stronger overall than most bands'.  They still know how to write songs that are wholly unique while still being immensely enjoyable.    \\"15 Step\\" begins with manufactured drums and characteristic falsetto, mumbling vocals, and develops into a nice opening track.  \\"Bodysnatchers\\" is very much a normal rock song, and is a bit surprising in that regard.  \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" has a good, simple guitar part that puts your mind at ease and lets the ambiance wash over you.  \\"All I Need\\" might be my favorite song on the album, with a nice, mellow sound that builds into the biggest climax on the record, which can give you chills with headphones on.  \\"House of Cards\\" is another more mainstream sounding song, although it doesn't skimp on haunting, distant vocals, and uses it's status as longest track on the album to explore the possible avenues.  \\"Videotape\\" wraps things up with minimal piano and percussion, and leads you along without giving you too much.  Despite the typical stranger elements, In Rainbows still sounds like a relatively happy album compared to Radiohead's other works, and that's part of the reason I liked it so much.  I don't think I'll ever totally love them as much as other people do, but I still acknowledge their ability to make consistently good, unique music.

1582701709|4.0|A frequently asked Question...    Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?    The answers are in The Secret if you can open yourself up to them!    Rhonda Byrne found the secret to life in a hundred-year-old book that all the people who have achieved greatness seemed to have known. She did a marvelous job in bringing together many teachers who know this secret and blending their knowledge into one message. The message these educators send out to the world through this book is:     ANYTHING you ask for is yours. It is a UNIVERSAL LAW!    We emphasize the word anything because it is explained that everything you have in your life right now, you asked for...the good and the bad. These educators clearly explain how this universal law works and how to use it to create only those things you truly desire.    Many people don't want to hear and accept the truth that we create our own reality...so they will continue to get the same results they have been getting with the same type of thinking they have been doing. If you can open youself up to something a little different, maybe you can enjoy a different life. The SECRET may be the key which unlocks your treasures!    We rated this book a 4.5 because it contains basic knowledge of the Law of Attraction Principles for those who have not heard this concept before.  For more extensive information, we suggest you read Ask and it is Given and the Power of Emotions both by Esther and Jerry Hicks (The Teaching of Abraham.)
0525950079|2.0|There are two major flaws in World Without End. First, it's a costume drama, a story that dresses up modern characters in period clothes and places them in period settings. Otherwise, everything is modern. Second, there are no Christians among the characters. Both of these flaws are intertwined.<br /><br />Follett wrote in the preface to the paperback edition of Pillars that he does not believe in God. In that novel, he says, being uncomfortable with writing about religion and a celibate, he gave Prior Philip a minimal sex drive and a tremendous concern for people. That suited the era and the faith very well, in my opinion, because looking after the poor and taking care of people is the essence of Christianity.<br /><br />In World he avoids altogether writing about godly, faith-full Christians. There are no struggles with God, no wrestling with the Spirit, no emulations of Christ in this novel, no seekers after truth, no attempts to discern the will of God in a person's life. People have sex as they will, particularly Prioress Caris, without remorse or any sense of guilt or feeling that she has sinned and come short of the glory of God. That being the case, he has not portrayed the Medieval mind in any of his characters. They are merely the same types he has written about in his thrillers. They are modern secular characters of the sort we encounter in more thrillers than his.<br /><br />Caris is a selfish woman, entirely preoccupied with getting as much sex from Merthin as possible while giving nothing in return. She has an abortion and does not seem to care that she destroyed a human life. For a woman raised as a Catholic, that should give her agonies of guilt. She has the abortion simply because she does not want to marry the father of the child, whom she loves. Her remorse is slight. In this she is entirely secular, entirely modern. She is not Medieval.<br /><br />Sister Cecelia may be a true Christian, but we never see it because Follett does not go deeply into her character.<br /><br />Godwyn is a scoundrel in a monk's robe. No doubt there were such, but there is no foil to him. Brother Thomas comes the closest, but again his characterization is shallow and his faith is lightly passed over or ignored.<br /><br />It would be quite possible to write a thrilling novel of Medieval struggles in the Church; after all, there was the Reformation. Sincere Christians on both sides committed atrocities against each other in the name of Christ, and both probably thought they were doing God's will, grotesque as it may seem to us.<br /><br />But Follett has chosen to leave Christianity out of this novel, and in so doing he has written a costume drama, not historical fiction. It's too bad, because I could hardly put Pillars down, a remarkable statement for such a big book.<br /><br />The language of the book is thoroughly modern, as well, including the egregious exclamation by one of the characters: \\"Fantastic!\\" The word, fantastic, the Oxford English Dictionary says, did not come into use until late in the fifteenth century, and then only as referring to fantasy. Its modern use as high praise belongs to our time.<br /><br />For an example of good historical fiction in Medieval times, read the Brother Cadfael mysteries written by the late Ellis Peters.

B000Y7U98C|4.0|It's a trademark of Danny Boyle's films to show humans clinging to hope even in the worst possible circumstances---just think of the ending of Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.       Sunshine follows a similar pattern, with seven astronauts and scientists attempting to reignite a dying sun by means of a stellar bomb, thereby saving the Earth.  That this could mean their own deaths is something that probably weighs on their minds as much as on the viewer's.    The film will also put one in mind of Alien, with the confining space of the ship and the intimacy of a small group.  There's even a nod to Silent Running, with the greenhouse/oxygen garden on board.    The film might have benefited by the inclusion of some bits of backstory on these people and maybe some transmission from their families back on Earth.  Overall, however, it is an intriguing story.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|James Blunt appeared on screen a few years ago with that worldwide known hit \\"You're Beautiful\\" and kept on being called as the \\"singer of You're Beautiful\\". Got that album and liked it a lot -not talking about that song- but all the other great songs it contains and were absolutely ignored by the media.    \\"All The Lost Souls\\" represents a chance to prove if Blunt is going to be a one-hit-wonder or an everlasting -or at least, a couple of years- artist. I think this new production is very cool and fresh, great songs and this fantastic style this Brit has to offer. Some of the songs have an impressive beat as \\"1973\\" -by far my favourite- and also the soft characteristic style with \\"One of the Brightest Stars\\".    \\"I´ll Take Everything\\" is quite strong with an equilibrium between voice and guitar, I like the way it starts and goes. \\"Same Mistake\\" reminds me \\"Back to Bedlam\\"... I think it's Blunt's style, soft melodies and still voice tunes until he breaks with stronger voice levels. I can say almost the same with \\"Carry You Home\\" which is also a great song, recognizable for the same contrast between slow and then fast beats. \\"Give Me Some Love\\" and \\"I Really Want You\\" makes me think about some fills in this album... not being too hard with it, I would say they are just OK. \\"Shine On\\" is a very nice ballad (and, from my point of view, I like it more than \\"One of... Stars\\". \\"Annie\\" is just OK and \\"I Can´t Hear the Music\\" finishes this album for good, I really like that song.    However, I would recommend this album because is evident that it is product of a hard working artist, not \\"any\\" singer but one of the guys that is pointing to be an everlasting star... -in my opinion, the best appearance in a while-. Time will tell.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|The special effects are A+ and puts a lot of American Scifi movies to shame. A great study in the human condition on long space flights with the job of saving humanity and the Earth from extinction. There are heroes and  sacrifices as the unique ship makes it way beyond the orbit of Mercury and near the Sun.<br /><br />The first 3/4 of this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat as you actually become part of the crew (not so easy to do, but this movie succeeded with it). The last 1/4 of the movie borrowed heavily from Event Horizon, but still succeeded in delivering.<br /><br />While limited in its movie release, it will become a SciFi classic.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Ok, it's another 5-star release...what else could it be? You've got all her albums already? Why buy a Greatest Hits? Not sure why. Maybe for the previously-unreleased tracks (Party For Two, both versions)? That's enough right there, but you get all those other wonderful songs, too.    She's just got a beautiful voice that sounds great in any song, from the slow, reflective ballads to the catchy, poppy, upbeat songs. It doesn't matter, she's just great to listen to.    I particularly like the mix of songs she does. Don't Be Stupid has got to be one of my favorites, tied up there with No One Needs to Know and She's Not Just a Pretty Face (why wasn't it included?!). Rhythmic riverdance to country ballads, and pop-rock: they're not my usual fare, but I can't deny she has appeal.    Of course, my Greatest Hits CD would have about, what, 60 songs on it? How many has she released?    Keep 'em coming!!!
B00009TB5G|4.0|If you like The Two Towers, you can buy the itty bitty DVD...you know the one I'm talking about--the one with the sweet picture of Frodo and Gandalf (which gives away the fact that he lives) and the ominous two towers...hence the title. If you like EVERYTHING there is to the trilogy, you get this mother.<br /> Back when I was considering a career in everything (and when I say everything, I mean everything from music performance on my violin to CG work to being a court justice to writing the great American novel, etc., etc., etc.) I checked out everything on this DVD. It showed how the actors acted, how the CG guys created Gollum, how the costume guys created, well, costumes, what Peter Jackson ate for breakfast, everything. It was like an odyssey outside the odyssey. These DVDs tend to be a little pricey (or at least they were when I bought them), because you're getting what you paid for. It's a must for diehards, but if you're just curious about the trilogy, I'd rent the itty bitty version first before tackling the meaty stuff.

0143039601|1.0|I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better.
0783219695|4.0|Very seldom does America celebrate a failure. When it does, it's phenomenal. This film explores the adventure of three astronauts who didn't quite make it to the moon. No one gave a flying fig when they were getting off; they only cared when it looked like they wouldn't make it. This film is quoted 24/7 (unless you've been living in a hole in a tree and never heard the \\"Houston, we have a problem\\" that's been on every flipping commercial in the USA).<br /> James Horner=master score composer. Ron Howard is brilliant. This will become an American classic, if it's not already. No one wastes money buying this film. It's like a coffee maker. You could argue that you don't absolutely NEED it, but doesn't every American have one anyway?
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The SB-400 is such a nice little flash.  The only thing is it won't remotely fire from the Nikon CLS.  You need the SB-600 for that.<br /><br />I am in awe of the SB-400.  I've used it on the D40, D40x, D80, D300, D300s, and D700.  It is small and simple to use.  I have two SB-600s that I remotely fire from either the D80, D300s, or D700.<br /><br />This is such a good deal that I'll bet Nikon is soon going to obsolete it.

0757302661|5.0|First of all I delivered a 9 pounder in under 12 hours, with no interventions or pain meds.    I had terrible childbirth fears prior to taking the class and reading the book. I had an extraordinary teacher and this book was a great companion to the class. I gained so much confidence from this method that at 30weeks  pregnant I switched from my OB and hospital to a midwife at a water birthing center.     I loved the daily practices, it helped my husband connect to the pregnancy, feel involved and bond with the baby.    When my contractions started we did one of the relaxation scripts and all during labor we played the birth affirmation CD that you get when you take the class.    My little one arrived gently in the water. I felt no pain until I was 9cm dilated. Seriously none! I wasn't even sure I was in labor. I did feel pain after that, but I stayed on top of it.     This method taught me to trust my body and to do what I needed to do.     Those who thinks this book made their labor harder because they didn't get their epi fast enough or whatever, missed the main point of this book... which is to trust yourself. If you felt you needed an epi, then ask for it. The book didn't stop you. Nor was the book overly critical of epiderals or other medical interventions... it stated the risks (which there are a lot) and took the approach that the people reading this book wanted a med-free/intervention-free birth, so it teaches methods to achieving that. Those methods don't work for everyone. And there is a time and place for all the interventions... if you feel you need them then get them.

B000RO9PXC|5.0|I always was a fan of the music more than the Morrison vocals so the criticism I've read about him being drunk through most of these songs doesn't apply to my rating.  The music here is just great as they jam and improvise throughout.  They had a unique sound that's never been duplicated.  Morrison was not as bad as some of the reviews indicate. I could do without the vulgarity that was left in.  It is insignificant and adds nothing to the CD.
0131103628|5.0|The other comments capture the importance of this book, so I won't dwell on it. The main point I would like to make is that this book is accessible to somebody who has no programming experience at all, as this was my first book for my first programming language over 27 years ago in my high school. We had a pdp11/70 running UNIX and all I knew at the time was how to do basic UNIX commands (ls, cp, rm, and then cc, of course), and how to drive a text editor, a variant of Emacs.    The rest is up to you. You need to have a passion and it will help a great deal to have a mentor or a teacher who can answer all your questions. I knew I had the passion when I couldn't sleep at night.    One last thing: Programmers who learn C and really understand it, pointers, and \\"how strcmp actually works\\" will be good programmers in higher level languages like Java, Ruby or anything else that comes along. If you start out with the higher level languages and never learn what is really going on at the machine level (which is where C is at), you will write inefficient code and have no idea why. The world is full of programmers like that today. Try not to be one of them.
0307387151|1.0|Another literary darling falls off my radar screen. I am always looking for good authors and good writing, but this novel plodded along at its own slooowwwww pace, a sure cure for insomnia, but hardly entertaining and downright maddening at times.  It takes until page 150 to get to the climax scene where Briony mistakes a display of passion for rape. By then I had ceased caring about the characters, if I ever had - spoiled rich Brits on their country estate waiting for something to happen.  I was not overly wowed by the writing style either along the way by this suppossedly superior author.  Blah, blah blah and on and on he driveled.  Alas, I am putting it down for good this time.  Time to take it back to the half price bookstore and salvage at least something.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Stargate SG-1 and also the spin-off series Stargate: Atlantis.  It was horrible that the Sci-Fi network did not carry on this show; the ratings, the popularity, the fan base, even the show speaks for itself....10 YEARS.  Never has any other Sci-Fi series lasted that long.  Even the long running Star Trek sagas, all of them ran for their respective 7 seasons then came to an end.  And the stupid thing is, they canceled SG-1 when the story line was at a strong point with the battle with the Ori.    The Goa'uld story line alone lasted for 8 years, then the Ori became the next ultimate threat, A LOT more could have been done carry on the show.  Why didn't MGM just move the show to another network?  It first started on Showtime, then onto Sci-Fi; if Sci-Fi no longer wanted the burden (stupid decision I might add since their ratings would have carried one at a high point) then why didn't they just move on to another network?    I am looking forward to this movie.  And I hope they make some more.
B00006IX0R|5.0|So these are \\"radio singles?\\" I don't even know what that means. What I do know is how much I enjoy the music on this CD! Love this group.<br /><br />I bought this CD while I was in Ireland. Here's the story. At the end of my trip in Dublin, I found a music store, told the clerk I wanted several kinds of Irish music. You need to understand--I am a white, middle-aged woman, Irish ancestry, yes, and an adventurer in both travel and music. So, he picked out some CD's for me, one of which was this one by the Cranberries. It is one of my all-time favorites. I also bought one by the Corrs (love them, too), one by Declan O'Roarke (a ballad singer) and several collections (love all of those), one Clannad and two U2's.<br /><br />Back to the Cranberries. I think this is significant to say: I like every song and skip none. Isn't that a good recommendation? Here are my comments on individual songs:<br /><br />\\"Zombie\\"--ya know, it must look strange to see a middle-aged woman with vivid red hair (gets help, yep) driving down the road, doin' some head-popping, oh yeah. Best song on the CD!<br />\\"Ode to My Family\\"--I think she is berating her family, but not sure as I don't understand everything she says<br />\\"Salvation\\" is another favorite. Is this about not getting high?<br />\\"Animal Instinct\\"--another favorite<br />\\"Time is ticking out\\"--love the tune, love the message<br />\\"This is the day\\"--love the way her voice tricks in and out<br />\\"Daffodil Lament\\"--love her voice on this one<br />\\"New new York\\"-fun song, love to sing it with her at the top of my voice while driving<br /><br />Yes, sure, you could pick apart the music, but why? It gives so much joy and loosens up the emotions. I'm for that! Long sing the Cranberries!
006085880X|3.0|After reading a few Picoult books, it is pretty easy to see through her formula and thesis statement right of fthe bat, so I won't bother reiterating what everyone else says about the structure of her books. And though in some of her novels, the structure seems forced and there are many unrealistic events/characters/etc., I felt that for this book, the court room drama worked better than others. And like the rest of her work, answers don't come easily or quickly, sometimes they don't come at all.  Ostensibly, Emily killed herself because of the pressure put on her by her parents, the fear of disappointing them, her disturbing feelings about her relationship with Chris, her childhood molestation. Yet none of these reasons feels like they would create a person who was so normal on the outside and yet so conflicted and tortured on the inside that no one, not even her meant-to-be other half, noticed. The reader feels like screaming at all the characters in her life that she's in pain, and then screaming at her for making a decision like this when it doesn't make sense and she hasn't even tried to get help. But in a way, that is the beauty of Picoults writing; she doesn't know her characters any more than we do. I sometimes feel as if Picoult is merely a reporter, stating facts when she knows them, but in the end leaving the interpretation and judgement up to the reader. And it also explains why her endings tend to fall a little flat, because a true story has no dramatic, twisty ending. This is especially true in her latest, 19 minutes, which has so much character development that you feel as if you know these people in real life, but their true motives and feelings are always hidden.But Picoult had to end it somehow, so she chose an overly dramatic, unrealistic ending. The ending to this book was fabricated, and felt more like something that might actually happen in a court room.  It is important to remember that despite all of the things going for her, Emily is suicidal, and it seems like Picoult was saying no one thing can really warn others about that possibility. If Emily is suicidal, anyone can be suicidal. We can never truly know what pushed her over the edge, or what might push anyone of us over the edge. The reasons Picoult presented us with might not be sufficient for suicide, but is any suicide ever really justified? Can it ever be rationally explained?   I only gave this three stars because in the end, there was no pact between the lovers, and you learn that very early on, so the whole suspense of it is gone. The book not about a suicide pact, it is just about suicide, and if it had actually been a pact, it might have been much more interesting.
0143038419|1.0|She really has a cushy life - how many people could take a year off to 'find themselves', especially in their middle thirties? She eats her way through Italy and gains weight - but hey, she NEEDED to gain as her terrible ex-husband had made a real stink about the property division, and she had lost weight worrying about this. No one else has ever had divorce problems. Well, not like hers as she is so special. She then goes to India to live in an ashram - a Special ashram where only a few people are allowed, by appointment - to 'find God', who is actually revealed to her... (did I mention she is special?) I think she was going on to the gorgeous island of Bali, where she was to find True Love, but I got so bored at this point I took it back to the library. She complains and complains about how bad her life has been. Well, everything is relative but to most people, her life is cushy.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|While obviously abridged compared to the A&E mini series, this P&P is dead-on accurate.  Though I still appreciate the A&E version, Wright captured the 'everyday-ness' of Austin's time: the dirt, the dress, the deportment, and Austin's well crafted satire.    Compared to Wright's P&P,  A&E's characters are wooden while Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins and, Mr. Wickham are nearly cartoonish.  On the other hand, Wright's Lady Catherine seems overblown though in the capable hands of Dame Dench, and Donald Sutherland's physicality doesn't quite fit Mr. Bennett though he does capture the character's charm & sense of humor.      Wright's costuming & sets were well researched exemplified by older women wearing less fashionable gowns and younger women dressing more stylishly within their particular  social rank.  In the A&E P&P, there is little variation in dress with so much pure white linen which could lead one to wonder if Longbourne was a suburb of Heaven.    Wright's choreography and camera work really 'raised the bar' for historical dramas, too.  A&E's comes across as overly reheased & rigidely exacting while the camera remains static.  All of this results in scenes that are \\"not so much like a ball\\".    With the luxury of time, the A&E P&P does include the entire Wickham subplot, one which Wright  was required to  abridge but did so fairly elegantly.  Both versions exclude the novel's postscript-like conclusion.    Enjoy both, and a read of Austen's novel.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Wonderful musical performances from an extremely well done movie that would make an excellent live show. These vocals and productions are so well done that they may even serve to extend the life of these songs. On purely musical terms this Beatles soundtrack probably succeeds better than other attempts even though All This And World War II from the 70's had more big name singers(Elton John, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Peter Gabriel, Leo Sayer, etc.
B000063UR1|1.0|This movie sucks so bad! The star of the film is weird and lame, nothing cool ever happens. Its totally pointless to watch this movie if you have ever seen any si-fi flick put out after 1974! Don't buy it if you haven't seen it yet, save your money for Logons Run or 2001 - A Space Odyssey.
0670034711|5.0|OK, it was my crazy GF, who loves this inspiring author and she subsequently bought about a dozen to send out as X'mas gifts, to some of her lucky family & friends! It sure beats sending out the same fruit cake that has been circulating around in our network for years!<br />I will leave the feedback on this book for someone else, as I've not read it yet.
B000UBMWG4|1.0|I recently purchased the Blu-ray version of this 5-disk set and was shocked to open the case to find 3 of the 5 disks loose within the packaging.  I inspected the disks and found no major flaws ... then proceeded to place the first disk which contains the feature movie into my PS3 .... nothing happened ... removed the disk to re-inspect it and noticed a strange looking logo on the front of the disk ... it was labeled HD-DVD! ... two of the remaining 4 disks had the blu-ray logo with the remaining two having the standard DVD logo ... obviously having one studio with multiple formats is just a tad too complicated for them ... guess they should have stuck with laserdisks ... a bit harder to confuse them with the beta version.
B000CC49G2|5.0|How do you teach a child confidence?    You could put their work on the refrigerator, frame it, or talk about it with others.  In this story the teacher frames a small dot drawn by a child who claims she is unable to draw. The little girl is also asked to sign her work, which emphasizes value.     Society values signatures.  We want the signed book, the signed football pendant, the autograph, etc. because we perceive it is more valuable. Children can relate to signatures. Children understand signatures mean something (whether it is a report card that needs signing, an illness note for school, or the need to sign a \\"take home\\" folder).  Thus, immediately the little girl realizes when asked to sign her work that her dot, her creation, is also valuable.    This wonderful story teaches children about trying, about at least starting, at least making an effort, and then seeing where that start can take you... This lesson is taught through art in this storybook but reminded me of what we were always told in writing, \\"Write, just start.... <see where it takes you...>\\"    Henry Ford said, \\"If you think you can... or if you think you can't... you're right.\\" This simple story illustrates a message of positive \\"can do\\" type thinking.     I also especially like that the little girl passes on what she learns at the end of the story by asking a little boy to sign his work. Setting a good example and passing on your knowledge to help others is a lesson for all children!
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five tells the unique tales of Billy Pilgrim as he travels through time. The main part of the story is how Billy became a prisoner of war during World War Two and his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden, Germany. But it also includes Billy's other journeys, such as his trip to the planet of Tralfmadore, where he and his porn star mate are monitored by the Tralfmadorians, who live in the fourth dimension.     I really enjoyed reading this book because of the brilliant way Kurt Vonnegut used a character that had the ability to travel through time to show how the war affected him during and after the war. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Billy watched a war film backwards. The way Vonnegut described the movie really gave you a feel for the cruel intention of war and the damage it can create. In my opinion, this is the greatest anti war novel I have ever read.    Kurt Vonnegut is an interesting author because of how original his writing technique is. He uses many different ways to develop characters in this book, rather than just blandly explaining about the character. He also uses similes often to give the reader a really good mental picture. I think that Vonnegut's style of writing is very effective as far as getting his message across in a way that makes you think.    I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone because it has a philosophy that I think everyone could gain from. It's also a very unique read and Vonnegut does a very good job at keeping the reader constantly interested in what's going on. If you want a book that will give you a new perspective on things then I think you've found the right one.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|They have done it again. You must go to YouTube (sorry Amazon) and watch the 54 minute video of the band playing the entire work in their studio. Mesmerizing.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is FANTASTIC!!  I can't say enough about it!  My husband & I are stationed overseas, so I was unable to see Stardust in theatres and had to wait for it to come on DVD.  Our military store SOLD out of this movie in less than 2 wks!!!  So I ordered from WONDERFUL amazon and got it like like a week & 1/2 or so.  Wonderful movie for most any age!!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I'll keep this short, since anything I could have added to the long list of great reviews is simply non-existent.  This is mainly just to support a perfect rating for this album, which it deserves.  This is one of Radiohead's best, at a dead heat with Kid A and OK Computer (both amazing records).  It has its own personality, and stands out as a very moving and compassionate album.  In Rainbows is more about emotion and feelings than about ideas.  A very beautiful and important work.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I've been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy line for many years now, so when this release came out I rushed to buy my own copy. When it came to the graphics, I was more than impressed. They were remarkable in every way, which made me glad for purchasing this selection.  As for the story plot, I was slightly disappointed because it really didn't expand much on the characters.  Still, to think that a 1 1/2 - 2 hour movie could compete with the original game, which consisted of hours upon hours of game play, would be ridiculous.  I wouldn't neccessarily suggest this one to anybody who isn't familiar with FF7 just because it'd be confusing trying to figure out who the characters are and their significance (mostly when they all show up on Cid's airship). Otherwise, if you played the game and liked it, then don't hesitate. Buy it.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|My wife and I watched this performance from the Grand Tier. At the time, we agreed that the staging and performance were superb, and the cameras were unobtrusive, but thought that some of the performances, notably that of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, were a tad 'wooden'.<br /><br />A few months later, we saw the broadcast performance, and were very pleasantly surprised. Hvorostovsky's performance was far from wooden: with the benefits of the TV camera, we could see every subtle nuance, every expression, every gesture. His was a performance of the highest standard. Bravo!<br /><br />And here we find one of the differences between televised and live performances - the camera can pick up subtleties which just aren't visible from the back of the theatre (and exaggerate 'operatic acting'as it happens). True, watching a live performance has other advantages - the ambience, the freedom to choose what you want to look at, people-watching, the champagne during the intervals....<br /><br />In the past, there have been other differences - poor direction, inadequate sound, extraneous noise, but this is no longer an issue. This Brian Large production is basically superb! Picture quality is excellent, reflecting the clever lighting effects on stage. Sound is crystal clear, with enough resolution to distinguish individual applause (ours must have been in there somewhere, I suppose). This recording, in many respects, is even better than the 'real thing'.<br /><br />Putting technicalities to one side, the production itself was of the highest calibre. All the singers, without exception, were at the top of their form. Aria after aria ended in thunderous applause. Gergiev was amazing, extracting every ounce of emotion from Tchaikowsky's music.<br /><br />The minimalist sets were, I thought, very clever. I particularly liked the first ballroom scene, where the dancers were crowded together in a slightly too small dance floor flanked by mis-matched chairs. The effect was of an impromptu ball run by a family who were comfortably off, but a little down-at-heel. The leaves, as a symbol of time passing, were very effective, particularly during the overture.<br /><br />And now, I think, enough time has passed.<br /><br />This is a superb recording in every way; one to be treasured.ut a little down-at-heel.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I gave it to my husband for Christmas. He was thrilled to pieces. He had been wanting it for a long time but would never buy it for himself. He was sooo excited. His face was lit up. The rating is for the smile it put on his handsome face. Awesome buy!
B000V6BE6M|5.0|As its predecessors, this complete recording is offering the whole soundtrack of the Extended Edition in a nice box formed as a book. Thhis time even 4 CDs are needed to cover all the tracks. The DVD-Audio with the 5.1 sound has in fact to be bothsided to get it all on one - haven't seen that on an Audio-DVD before!  The soundtrack itself is probably well-known, Howard Shore takes up the themes from the previous parts and intertwines them with newly created. My personal favorite will still remain the first part (not only soundtrack-wise), but this is once again a fine piece of music offering hours of dreaming about Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf and the whole score while listening to it.  The quality of the recording is as good as can be expected, for example Pippin's song in the hall of Gondor is crystal clear. Of course I like the 5.1-recording most as it makes oneself feel inside the movie.
B000Y179KO|1.0|I have been a HUGE Eagles fan for over 30 years so I was really happy to hear they were coming out with a CD of all new music rather than the typical repackaged CD with one or two new songs.  After listening to the CD I can say it was not worth the wait.  With the exception of \\"How Long\\" which was apparently written over 30 years ago when the Eagles could still write music, the rest of this album is garbage.  Maybe they should have just repackaged the old stuff again.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This was a gift for my mother who has said that it was even better than she thought it would be.
B00000AFFI|5.0|it seems silly so many years later to review a CD,but i find a moment in life happening where this one is stuck in the player.what can you say about something when you know it passes the simple,yet greatest test,the test of time?in the same idea as Nico's \\"Marble Index\\",where it is not just about timelessness,but of almost a lack of time existing,this work stands on it's own ground...
B00007LTIB|2.0|I guess I don't hear what everyone else is hearing? The follow up to \\"Tales..\\" doesn't even come close. The main reason is because Rick Wakeman left the band and was replaced by Patrick Moraz.     Don't get me wrong, Moraz is a top notch keyboardist, but doesn't even measure up to Rick Wakeman. Wakeman split because he thought the band was starting to go too mainsteam and he wanted to continue his ideas with the solo approach.    Of the pre-80's Yes albums, this is the one I listen to the least. \\"Sound Chaser\\" is OK, but the rest of the album gets old quick. If you're a Rick Wakeman nut like myself then this album will disappoint you.
B000008JUM|1.0|It says click here to download, which is what I wanted to do.  It turns up some crazy album.  Amazon will have to get a LOT better at searching and user interface to win me over from iTunes.
0689853637|5.0|I absolutely love this book. You will not be disappointed.  It goes beyond the average pop up book.  Things actually come up and off of the page. Its really quite a piece of art.
0803729227|5.0|I grew up with Dr. Seuss, Where the Wild Things Are, the Mr. Men, and Goodnight Moon.  But when I picked up this gem at a gift shop in Pitlochry, Scotland, last summer, I immediately fell in love with the stunning drawings and moving story, told in impeccable rhyme and meter. I love that it shows children that there is a world beyond their own, where strange and wonderful creatures live.  My son will be two next month, and this has been one of his favorite books for several months now.  He'll ask for it several times a day, and, unlike all of his other books, I never tire of reading it to him.      I hope Donaldsons other books are as good, because my son will be receiving several of them for his birthday!
B000001Y5J|5.0|When my product arrived, it was shrink-wrapped, and brand new.  When i opened it, I found a BROKEN CD!!  I suspect that they are all the same.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Danny Boyle(Trainspotting)reteams with writer Alex Garland(28 days later)to deliver this little-seen, but nontheless specatular motion picture experience from Fox Searchlight Pictures. What amazes me is that this film didn't have a wider release given the caliber of craftsmanship that it possesses. Sunshine tells the story of our planet dying from a solar winter due the slow decay of the Sun and a second mission sent from Earth in hopes of reigniting the sun with a nuclear payload, as the first team sent failed their mission. Sure, this premise sounds a bit goofy and in our present state of film production it probably would have been a catasrophe, but with Boyle at the helm nothing is as it seems. Primarily, the mission to reignite the sun is secondary to the people performing the mission itself and how they have come to adapt to traveling millions of miles from home, close quarters, and the sheer chance that the payload might not have its intended effect and hummanity will cease to exist, is given much greater weight and intrigue. From a multi-ethnic cast, each charcter is genuinely fleshed out and given a fine degree of examination which brings the suspense to a heightend point. This is what science fiction should be in the purest sense: thought-provoking, excruciatingly intense, and a focus upon the elements of morality within each of us.
1594489505|5.0|This book really teaches you about the life in Afghanistan, the people, the great history, the wars and current events but more importantly the implorable situations that women in general live under.  I really enjoyed reading this book and the Kite Runner as well as it allows us to open our minds outside of our immediate environment and realize life is good in the US.  I usually read non-fiction books but was glad to give this fiction book a chance as it really impacted me similar to my regular book choices.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I got this as a christmas gift.  The best gift I have ever had! The flash works perfectly with my Nikon D40X.  It is small enough to always carry it with me. The flash head rotates upward if you want bounced light (I use that a lot). Bounced light makes a big difference as compared to the fill-in (pointing forward) flash. The angle of rotation appears to be automatically transmitted to the camera, so the camera adjusts the shutter speed and aperture automatically depending on how the flash is pointed, always producing beautiful shots!  The recharge time is extremely fast! I can take one shot after another pretty much immediately, and the flash is always ready. I almost never use the built-in flash anymore after I got this one. Highly recommended!
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Oh sure, anyone can do a Beatles cover--but how many of them are really done well? (The criminally underrated \\"I Am Sam\\" soundtrack is a good example of how to do it properly, as is Siouxsie and the Banshees' delicious \\"Dear Prudence.\\")  Without Julie Taymor's fantasmagorical film images to propel the story, and without the actors' faces (in loving close-up) to buttress the songs, you've basically just got another bunch of Beatles covers of ranging quality.  Fortunately, Taymor chose well.  Jim Sturgess handles the bulk of the material competently, and occasionally movingly, especially the opening track \\"Girl\\"; Joe Anderson fares a little less well, though in all fairness he doesn't have the best material--\\"With A Little Help from My Friends\\" and \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" could give anyone a run for their money.  Joe Cocker and Bono are...well, Joe Cocker and Bono, and thus very pleasurable in this context.  Only one male track is a clinker: Eddie Izzard's hopelessly affected \\"For The Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" which finds him chewing whatever scenery he could get his mouth around between and during lyrics. (When you have a song that bizarre, underplaying is probably a safer bet.)  But it's the female vocalists--suprise!--who really make this Magical Mystery Tour fly.  T.V. Carpio offers a lovely, yearning \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" that takes the lyrics in a completely different direction--you may miss the original's swaggering drive, but you won't soon forget this take, either.  Dana Fuchs manages to sound like Janis Joplin without ever sounding like a bad rip-off of Janis Joplin, and her incandescent work on \\"Helter Skelter\\" might melt your speakers.  Last but never, ever least, Evan Rachel Wood wraps her honeyed tones around several tracks and completely owns them.  Some fans may remember Wood's exquisite performance of \\"When the Red Red Robin\\" from \\"Once and Again,\\" but here she taps into something delicate and melancholy that bruises your heart.  \\"Hold Me Tight\\" and \\"It Won't Be Long\\" are sexy, throaty pleasures, but no vocal track all year in any musical rivals her caressing the lyrics to \\"If I Fell\\"--it's never been so poignant, so haunted, so fragile.  Please, Hollywood, please Broadway, please anyone--give this girl a spotlight, a microphone, and the dazzling career she so richly deserves.\\"It Won't Be Long\\" are sexy, throaty pleasures, but no vocal track all year in any musical rivals her caressing the lyrics to \\"If I Fell\\"--it's never been so poignant, so haunted, so fragile.

B00006I53S|5.0|I just bought this a few days ago and I must say that I am impressed. It is a very fast lens and super clear and bright. I have taken some of my best photos this week, without a doubt.  The lens, Rebel Xti and Speedlite way about 3.5lbs, so its a bit awkward. BUT totally worth it! Well done Canon, well done.
074322454X|5.0|One of my favorite books.  Incredible story.
0446530573|5.0|Mammamia!  These recipes are worth dying for.  This book is worth buying by itself for the \\"Sunday Gravy\\" recipe, you'll love it.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|First, this movie is one of the best I have seen.  It combines non-stop action with an edge of humor throughout.  I highly recommend it.      The UNRATED version has a few extra lines of dialog throughout the movie that makes it worth watching.  Overall, it is still the same movie as the one shown in theaters (actually, it has a THEATRICAL version included on the disc as well as the UNRATED).
B0009F9O08|5.0|Yes the other review from the guy who plays guitar is 100% right. The guitar playing is great especially on Moonage Daydream. I also play and I say the horn sounds combined with the rockin guitar could wake the dead. Bowie voice is strong either live here or in the studio.
0143038583|5.0|While reading this book you will think more critically about what you eat and what you feed your family.<br />Pollan is a good writer who lays out his facts, and tells his stories, without being preachy.<br />He has helped shape the way I look at food, and that was not an easy thing for anyone to do.
B000JSI7DK|4.0|Most people I talk to today do not realize that Sly wrote this story (among others). I am in no wise forgiving Sly for his crucial mishaps in later sequels, but some credit must be given here. This film won Oscars and other film awards on a budget of less than a million dollars and with (considered) b-rate actors. A lot of credit, then, must be given to the actual material. Thank you, Sly.<br /><br />The film starts out well with interesting and suggestive cinematography, with excellent direction in the first fight sequence. You must pay attention to the first five or six sequences, they are masterful in character development and really set the tone for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />This movie was blessed with the presence of great character actors, too. They certainly helped this quality film.<br /><br />Just a very gritty and occasionally poetic film that has stood the test of time. It will live on.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|After my first listen to this CD, I thought, this is just OK.  But the second listen, everything fell into place.  Overall a very good recording that definitely grows on you.  Good job Eddie.      Look forward to seeing the movie.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I just watched this and I loved it!!!  Stardust rocks.   It's become my favorite movie.     It's a shame that it didn't do quite well in theaters in the US.  It's awesome movie.   Hopefully, domestic dvd sales would make up for it.      Everyone in the film turned in good acting.   De Niro was really fun to watch.   Luv the transformation of Tristan from a boy to a confident man.  The ghost princes were hilarious.   Gotta watch it again !!!!!
B000URDEB0|2.0|I wanted to like the new lineup. I went at this album with an open mind, knowing that Tarja's talented voice couldn't be duplicated, and Tuomas wasn't trying to do so. I had every hope that I'd like Annette's voice with the band's music.    Sad to say, I can't bring myself to like it. Annette's voice is just too different, and does get operpowered. The whole is no longer greater than the sum of the parts with Annette singing. Perhaps if I had never heard of Nightwish previously my opinion would be different.    My advice, if you haven't listened to Nightwish pre-Annette and are looking for solid operatic metal with a 'pop-influenced' female lead, then give DPP a try. If you have listened to pre-Annette Nightwish, try to have an open mind and set aside all preconceptions. Maybe you'll like it.    I just don't.
B000002I99|5.0|Around this point in Cooper's career he could do no wrong.  This is just another great album that still sounds great today.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I heard the song \\"Life is Beautiful\\" on the radio and I was so touched by it that I cried. When I found out it was the soundtrack to Nikki Sixx's \\"Heroin Diaries\\" book, I was intrigued. How original is it to create a CD based on a book! I previewed the tracks on Amazon and found that all of the songs seemed just as good from the little I heard of them.     When I got the CD, I wasn't disappointed. The songs are just pure genius! The singer's voice is wonderful, the lyrics real and heartfelt, and the melodies and guitar-work are reminiscent of old-style metal but freshened up for the 21st century. I think this is the best CD to come out in a long time and it has made me excited about metal again and in music in general.     It's a little sad to think, though, that even with Nikki's success with Motley Crue, he still went through a harrowing experience with addiction. I guess no matter how successful people are, they still have their problems. I hope he's found some catharsis and redemption from creating this masterpiece. I thank him for this gift of music that I find both enjoyable and inspirational.
B000065V42|5.0|When I hear grown adults dog on this film, you gotta wonder about them. It is a kids film, yes, and clearly meant to be so. However, this goes far beyond the pale of normality within that genre. This was a first of its kind and well thought-out.<br /><br />The kids all did such a fine job with their respective roles, better than the adults, really. All in all, I remember this film tapping my imagination the way no other film did of that era. Of course, I was nine years old, and it did what it was supposed to do.<br /><br />When watching it now, I can still attest to its magic.<br /><br />Recommended for the family.
B000VDDDVO|3.0|I just wish that it was letterboxed and/or have the option to view it either way. Other than that, it's the standard classic made better with the colorizing.
1594489505|5.0|I won't rehash what other readers have said about this book.  It does not disappoint.  Hosseini makes such a brutal country like Afghanistan come to life, and makes people who may not understand its history want to read more about the cultures, peoples and terrains of this mysterious country.<br /><br />He uses Afghanistan, his experiences as a child, mixes in current history, characters and situations to create another masterpiece that as a non-fiction story may have been overlooked as too real, too harsh.  And yes, his simplistic style is certainly a plus.  The book, like his first book is hard to put down.  Every chapter, however short, ends in a twist and the reader is left wondering how the plot will end...and it doesn't end as expected.<br /><br />Don't expect happy endings in this book.  People who have read \\"The Kite Runner\\" will not be surprised in Hosseini's writing style or delivery.  However, I don't think Hosseini will be able to write a third novel with the same intensity because the depressing subject matter can be overwhelming.  I know I may not read his next novel if it takes place in Taliban Afghanistan.

1594489505|2.0|Khaled is wondrous in his story telling; his descriptives and emotional connection with the characters make the story very real. However, I feel that this story capitalizes on an age-old cruelty of human battery.
B00005JPTI|4.0|In 2009, a vaccine for cancer caused a virus that turned nearly all of the people on earth into rabid, blood-thirsty, zombies.  It is now 2012, and as far as Robert Neville (Will Smith) knows, he and his trusty dog are the only uninfected creatures in New York City.  He spends his days watching DVDs, driving the deserted streets hunting for deer, and working in his laboratory, trying to find a cure for this horrible virus.  No matter what, he has to be home by sundown, because that's when the zombies come out.<br /><br />I like Will Smith a lot and here he gives a somber yet powerful performance that tugs at your heartstrings and has you rooting for him.  He and his dog make a very likeable team and they make the movie.  I don't like films that over-do the CGI stuff - I think it makes then too cartoony - and, unfortunately, this movie is loaded with it.  The blown-up  bridges and deserted, weedy streets of New York are too obviously fake, and the zombies, while repulsive and frightening, are poorly done and never looked real.<br /><br />The unoriginal script and suspense factor were worth about three stars, while Smith's performance earned five stars, so I give it four stars; intriguing and sometimes intense, but not really thrilling, due to bad computer images and because the last-man-on-earth plot has been done before ([[ASIN:B000VAHR1E The Omega Man]] and [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]]).
B000QRIHXO|5.0|I don't look at this mature teaching from Eckhart as a mere book. It's a blueprint. A sign post. A key to help us unlock the next stage of human evolution.     Why such high praise? Because despite what our egos may tell us, this gets to the basic truth of why we are here and how at peace we can be, if we only will say yes to this moment. I got the CD version so I can play it again and again, since my threatened ego does not always allow the wisdom to come in.     Can a book change the world? If any can, it's this one.

B000002KDS|5.0|Alice delivers the goods with another album of shock and great songs.  Under My Wheels, Dead Babies, Killer and Be My Lover are just of few of the KILLER tracks.  Classic Alice Cooper!!
B00003CXUM|5.0|Hats off to Wong Kar Wai for successfully bringing to screen a brilliantly written poignant romance. Everything from the beautiful Maggie Cheung to the red wall paper in room 2046 makes this DVD worth it.  Criterion has put together lots of extras.   Special mention goes to the deleted scenes, which gives the viewer a totally different perspective to the film's ending.    Overall, its a must have for all film buffs!
B000VR824S|4.0|Why does nobody mention Jerry Douglas when he's up there with Vince Gill, Sheryl Crow, and Albert Lee? He's not even mentioned in the end credits! I also suspect he recorded the dobro guitar music played during the segments between songs and in the end credits. It's a shame.
B000P2A256|5.0|Maroon 5 has another great cd with It Won't Be Soon Before Long.  My favorite tracks on this cd are Won't Go Home Without You and Makes Me Wonder.  This, like Songs about Jane, is a great workout cd.

B00005JPD0|4.0|This movie directed by Tony Scott (Man on Fire) was filmed with great effect entirely in New Orleans. It is not a true sci fi film per se. Instead it blends crime thriller action with a science fiction staple- time travel. Denzel Washington plays ATF agent Doug Carlin. He along with hundreds of other law enforcement and emergency service workers have responded to the banks of the Mississipi after a terrorist bomb has killed hundreds. He lends his expertise to the FBI in sizing up the situation. They are impressed with his skills and invite him into their secretive investigative team. And their big secret- Quantum physicists working for top research universities and Uncle Sam have stumbled upon a way to bend time and space and remotely view recent past events.<br /><br />They want to look at this crime scene as it happens from their many aspects and find out who the terrorist(s) are. From his normal detective work Carlin has already found a murdered female(Paula Patton) whose death is dissimilar to the hundreds of other victims found in the river. He encourages the team to focus solely on her. The team begins remotely viewing the events in the life of this beautiful women as it is believed that she will have a very personal encounter with the terrorist at some point before she dies.<br /><br />But Carlin wants to push the envelope- can we do more than just look at the past? Can we send a message to ourselves in the past? Or travel there ourselves? That, as most science fiction fans know, creates immense complexities. Can you go back and fix one bad thing and keep everything else the same? If so what else will change. The plot is believable and plausible(although there is some strain at the end). The movie is entertaining from start to finish as Carlin is always running into something he might have had a hand in but can't remember (hence the title).
B000IXH6YM|4.0|Admittedly, my love of Pride and Prejudice might have influenced the fun I had reading this book. The romance is delightful but Bridget's quirky humor won me over. Great for the beach or just a quick engaging read.
B00003CXXP|5.0|...as Gertrude Stein once said of a Hemingway story--a painting unhangable in some way. But I said nearly. Those who do not understand the Gaze, what Eisenstein or Lacan were writing about, had better clear off. This film shows us something like unto the dilemma of automobile traffic: People far too stupid to be driving can always get themselves a license. Anybody, including a tiny tot, can walk into a theatre, but there is no guarantee they will understand what is going on.  People who are themselves something like artificial creations of their own egos will not \\"get\\" this at all, if they come to a creation like this expecting the gut-rushing thrills of Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. Notice, those two (now, presumably, \\"classic\\" titles) each include a measure of death.  Well, no one really dies in those movies. Artificial Intelligence delivers on its title and tagline, and you will have a devil of a time figuring out what is real, what is not, and what makes you real, after all, by the end of this, if you can comprehend it at all. Even the windows go smart in this film.<br /><br />AI may be one of the greatest films ever made, for it takes the entire conception of cinema, from its very beginnings, as its topic. While in film school, I fiddled with a little Benji bear of my wife's, I would get it in at least one shot of every film I made.  Don't you see? We have a need to project life on to things like teddy bears, so we can love them. In the cinema , one is enabled to do this. Terminator can cut off Arnold Schwarzenegger's arm, right while Arnie is pretending to be the terminator,  or cut out his eye, and he is a cyborg underneath! HJ Osment can pretend to be a robot--or an animation or an animatronic device can pretend to be him. If you slow the film down, or freeze frame it, you can see that this is simply a representation. In an earlier day you could even take the film itself off the reel and look at it, frame by frame. How real is an image in gel and silver nitrate?  But perhaps we, ourselves, are merely representations of our parents' DNA. They were the real people. We are virtual.<br /><br />All in the film, the almost perfect illusion, the simulation, of life itself. So if simulation became reflective, due to neuronal sequencing, as here, would it have an \\"existence\\"? If you were not really you, say, but a huge battery of stored memory, still thinking, still active even though your body is dead, and this memory bank still remembered all the things you had done in your life, and thought about them, as your things, and reflected on them, just as you reflect as you are reading this, would that be an identity, an existence?  If things such as global warming, or nuclear war are concerns, right now, perhaps you should think of these things. And, by the way, this film does a masterful job of creating a future creation--some time far hence--in which human existence on this planet becomes challenged. You need to think about the issues this film brings to the surface. The beautiful silicon resin and fiber android beings with their nanotechnological disassembling car may never happen, you know. We may kill ourselves off before we have managed to create artificial intelligence.<br /><br />Visually, also, tremendous eye-candy, stunning effects, and Jude Law is absolutely brilliant in his role as Gigolo Joe. Just imagine, girls, a life-sized, musical comedy dildo. A world overcome by water, and ice.  A species extinguished by its own inventiveness. God help us.<br /><br />Very, very good.perhaps we, ourselves, are merely representations of our parents' DNA. They were the real people. We are virtual.

B0012BUX0I|4.0|If you don't own Triad Productions version of Rashomon, you are missing out!  The cover art is spectacular and the productions is definately top quality.     If you have never seen this film, you will come to it and find it very familiar. That's because Rashomon has become part of the world's consciousness & lexicon. It's story of an action involving several participants, each with their own differing version of the truth, has been elaborated and riffed-on by many others since it appeared on the world's stage in the 50's.    So you come to Rashomon not to be overwhelmed with its \\"newness\\" and the refreshing change of first encountering Japanese cinema and acting styles. No, you come to Rashomon as to an old master, to appreciate its lasting impression of the universality of human foibles and passions and the illusory nature of truth.    A rape and murder have occured in a woods. We hear and see different versions of the same encounter. Who is telling the truth? Is there an absolute objective truth, or does every teller of the tale inherently only tell the truth as he sees it? And if everyone is a \\"liar\\" and there is no absolute truth, what is the point of anything?    Don't let the heavy questions mislead you. Rashomon moves quickly, fluidly and gracefully, telling its story with economy and, to me, humor. Much is made of the dark philosophy underneath the theme, but I find great sardonic humor in the film. One example, the fight between the thief & the man as related by the woodcutter...it is messy and unheroic, sweaty, breathless and awkward and the antithesis of the stylized balletic sword fights found in, even Kurosawa's, samurai movies.    In the end, as familiar and much copied as Rashomon has been, it is still like no other film. It is unique, and the result of a master filmaker's vision, unified and beautiful and unforgettable.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|I did not give Arctic Monkeys a honest chance at the beginning, simply because of the big hype that came along with them. But after some time it was impossible to resist.     This album is the most satisfying album i've heard since Radioheads Ok Computer. It is so detailed, well planned and tight. The music is simple and honest, but still very advanced. No effects or multiple guitars laid on, which probably is the reason why they sound so awesome live. The songs really grow on you and sticks with you for a very long time. Songs like Balaclava, D is for Dangerous, Old yellow bricks and do me a favour may take a while to enjoy altrhough, while Brianstorm, Flourscent Adolscent and Teddy Picker hits you straight away. Buy it-and support this magnificent band!
0553213105|5.0|This was an assigned reading book in 7 grade. When I first started reading I thought it was boring then something happened about 20 pages into it. I discovered a perfect romance. Austen puts so much life into these characters. The book draws you in to their story. The only downside is it ends to soon.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|I know that there are several negative or near negative reviews about this product but to this person it is great.  I know that there are people like me who plunked down cash for the albums, then cassettes, and really did not want to spend any more on CDs.  This solves the problem for getting the best of Zepplin without shelling out 100 dollars or more in CDs or downloading low quality MP3s.   My only complaint is that when ripped into Itunes and Media Player the volume level was a bit low...so replaying them on a portable player requires adjusting the volume.  Other than that it is great.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|I'll admit that I'm one of the people who really didn't care much for Zodiac as much as others. As a film its a wearing experience that goes very slowly showing the reality of the case itself. Investigators gather clues, recieve letters from the Killer. There are false leads from grandstanders seeking attention and slowly the obsession builds in the three investigators, reporters Paul Avery and Robert Graysmith and detective Dave Toschi. Its not a film with any real closure for what the killings (which are some of the most brutal on screen without any gore or very little blood) just an idea that lead to a dead end with the death of the main suspect Arthur Leigh Allan. I saw it in a quiet theatre and enjoyed most of the scenes minus one where a false lead to Graysmith leads him to the basement of a creepy film buff that doesn't pan out in the end. Its an intensely suspensful moment but in theatres it felt like padding on a three hour run time that grated on my patience. Still the procedural details do fascinate me and the film plays better in a home setting to me where the viewer can stand in stretch so they're not immobile for three hours. Theres humor from Downey Jr. and Gyllenhalls interactions with each other, Fincher shows his visual flare but in a somewhat more subdued method (one method of misdirection is that three different actors play the killer in the murder scenes). And in the end you can become engaged with the obsession of wondering who the killer was.  I do have to say though that the Zodiac Directors Cut does fit with one of those great things about DVD. This set fits like other disc sets like the special editions of Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor or the Kingdom of Heaven Directors cut in that not only do you get a special edition of the film but the features figure in heavy to the real history of the story. On the first disc you have two great commentaries from David Fincher and a group commentary from the actors, producer Brad Fischer, writer James Vanderbilt and crime fiction writer James Ellroy who steals the track with his bravado. On the second disc you have some great making of material but a split up documentary on the Zodiac murders themselves with detectives and victim Bryan Hartnell who provides a great commentary on the Barryessa killing. and a great one on prime suspect Arthur Allan Leigh where it talks to friends and investigators giving background on why Allan might have been the killer. The thing about this one is while they spend half an hour outlining why Allan might have been Zodiac from evidence and victim Mageau pointing his picture out of a lineup, theres two professors who shoot down easily why all this conjecture might be false why all of the evidence can be tied by the tenous of strands without being really hard fact. Thats very Rashomon showing how our obsession is more than likely all it will ever be, an obsessive need to know the truth without really knowing a thing. The whole two disc set improves the film and was well worth the extra wait for it. I find myself liking the film more because of the extras included in this disc.

0143038419|1.0|I expected insight, not self-absorption. Unfortunately, reading this book was a waste of my time.
1419367323|5.0|\\"'To the Lighthouse,'\\" he thought. \\"Yes. I shall read `To the Lighthouse.'\\"    The thought was not a new one to him, but this time, it had appeared in his mind almost before he realized that it had appeared. He did not know why it had appeared just now, but there it was. And it was a good thought, he decided, one that he would act upon, one he would make a success of. He was glad for his decision, for he was one of that class of people who find it difficult to distinguish between the thought and the actual practice of the thought, and so was endowed with a sense of satisfaction and bliss that he would soon be reading, once again, \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"    But a second thought came to him, immediately following the first. It chided him, and said to him, you did not like the book before, when you tried to read it the first time, so why do you want to read it again now, and probably fail once more. The time is not right for you to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"     As soon as he thought it, the new thought infuriated him and he felt that if he had a knife, or a hatchet, or a blade of some sort, and if the thought had been a person, and not just a random thought, that he would pierce its heart with the blade and kill it. He was that upset about not being able to finish \\"To the Lighthouse\\" when he had attempted to read it the first time.    He recalled the time he had first tried to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" It was only a month or so ago. He could not recall the exact day, or the time, or even the month, but on one fine fall day, sitting in his office, Scot, sitting on the other side of the cubicle wall, had asked him, as he often asked such questions, if he had ever read Virginia Woolf. No, he had replied, he had not.    He searched his memory, seeking to find a title by Virginia Woolf that he could remember. Almost at once, he realized, after thinking about it for only a moment, that he had not ever read anything by Virginia Woolf, and wondered directly why he had not read anything she had written. In point of fact, he thought to himself, he did not even know the title of a single book by Virginia Woolf. It was strange.    Of course, he had heard of Virginia Woolf, as had anyone of his generation, for he could remember clearly the movie, what was it called, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Oh, yes. \\"Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" That was the title of the movie. But he could recall little about the movie itself, and, because it was so many years ago, he had almost forgotten its title, or even what it was about, except that it was about a college professor and his frustrated wife, and something about an imaginary child. Beyond that, he could remember nothing about the film, and had in fact wondered, even as he had watched it, first in the theater and then several years later on a television rerun, what, indeed the movie had to do with Virginia Woolf. And many years later, now, brooding about the novels of Virginia Woolf and the movie \\"Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\\" he was still perplexed as to what this film had to do with Virginia Woolf, for he could think of nothing, nothing at all, beyond the title, of course. Except that the husband, as played by Richard Burton, was a college English professor.    And as he often did with such thoughts, in this case, the thought that he should read a book by Virginia Woolf, he decided to follow up on it and find out more about Virginia Woolf and acquire one of her books to read. Online, he searched the catalog of the Dallas Public Library, and eventually, after discovering at last how to spell the name correctly, W-O-O-L-F and not W-O-L-F-E or some other such variation, he found the lengthy list of books written by Virginia Woolf, and was startled, for he usually knew such things, when he realized that he did not recognize even one of the titles.    In dismay, he had called back across the cubicle wall to Scot, who was sitting there patiently, doing what Scot does, whatever it is, to pass the time of day at the office. Which book by Virginia Woolf should he read, he had asked, and directly came back the reply, across the cubicle wall: \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" Scot had said he should read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"    Upon arriving home from the office that day, he had discovered that he had no other pressing obligations for the evening, and so he had collected his various things to return to the library, books he had finished, records he had played, library things, collected them all together and carried them out to the car, and driven into town, directly to the library. Shortly thereafter, on the third floor of the library, in the fiction section, correctly but not predictably filed under W, for the library had recently been rearranged, and sometimes books were taken off the shelf to be part of a temporary display, or even taken downstairs to entice patrons randomly seeking an interesting book to read, he had found a copy of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"    Happily he checked it out, and took it home with him, with much anticipation of beginning it in the morning, for he planned to read it on the train while going to work.    Unfortunately, when he started it, sitting in his usual seat on the train the next morning, riding to work, he found the book uninteresting. He simply could not grasp its meaning, or follow the flow of its words, or the complexity of its sentences, or the vague and fleeting thoughts that Virginia Woolf had so carefully crafted for its pages. After all the weak romance novels, and slick mystery novels, and cheap crime thrillers, and clumsy science fiction stories that he had recently been reading, all written in the usual, direct, post-Hemingway style of contemporary American fiction, heavily laced with terse dialogue and carefully constructed plot twists according to standard formulas, the ephemeral beauty of Virginia Woolf's luxurious writing and lush prose and sketchy plot was able to make scarcely a dent in his shallow American consciousness.     So, after a few days of making little headway, even after what he considered to be an heroic effort, he snapped the book shut in confusion and frustration and put it aside. He did not like \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" he told Scot the next day, and said that he had found it boring, and had put it aside. Reluctantly, of course, he had said, he had put it aside, for it was his usual custom to finish a book he had started, especially if it was a significant one, as in this case, a classic, like \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"    And Scot, rather unperturbed, as was his way, did not say anything much in response to his comment. He just said that he was reading it himself because of a school requirement and was happily deciphering its meaning. That is what Scot said he liked to do, in actual fact, to decipher meaning.    And so it was now weeks later, and there it was, still sitting on the table in his house, the copy of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" he had not yet returned to the library. He saw it there sometimes, sitting on the table, and he felt that it was reproaching him, chiding him as it were, that he had not been able to finish it, scolding him because he had found it vague and frustrating and meaningless and finally, boring.    And then, just a week or so prior to his Christmas vacation, the new thought had occurred to him, the thought that he should read \\"To the Lighthouse\\" again. Yes, he decided, he should read it again, and this time he would succeed, he was sure. He would try once again to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" This time, he thought, he would learn how to decipher its intricate text, parse its lush sentences, and find a way to penetrate to the very core of its meaning. But this time, he would not read the book, page by page, depending on his visual faculties, his eyes, to communicate the words to his brain. No. Instead, this time, he would use his ears, his auditory senses, the senses that he, as a trained musician, most favored. He would listen to someone read the text tohim. Suddenly, he knew what he was going to do. He would listen to a recording of the book, read by an accomplished reader, in the car, on the trip he was about to take for his Christmas Holiday.    By a fortunate chance, he found another copy of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" an audio book on 7 CD's, eight hours long, narrated by a British actress called Virginia Leishman. And so he acquired it out and carried it with him in the car on his trip.    Time passed.    First, time passed in the car.     And then, the time of the Christmas Holidays passed, as well.    The long trip from Texas to South Carolina had taken two days, two long rainy days of bad restaurants and a cheap hotel room, and driving in the rain in heavy traffic trying to avoid an accident. And the music on the XM Radio he had just bought had managed to divert his attention away from the album of seven CD's carefully packed in the box on the back seat of his car, the audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" that he had obtained with such anticipation to wile away the long hours on a road trip of many days, such as this one.    When he had arrived at his destination, he still had not listened to his recording of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" And while on vacation, the busy activities of the Christmas season occupied his time to such an extent that he had little time to read, much less listen to a book on tape for eight hours at a time, or even in one hour segments.    The happy days of the Holidays sped by, those short days and long nights of fun and festivity and family warmth, passing by quickly in a whirlwind of parties and dinners and gatherings and church services, those family moments that are the happy custom of celebration during the Christmas season. Suddenly, almost in a flash, he realized that the holidays were over and the joyful family celebrations and parties and gatherings were finished and it was time for him to return home.    With both a feeling of relief that the hectic holiday schedule was quicklydrawing to a close, and yet with a tinge of regret that he would leave behind him once again the loving arms of his dear mother and the good-will of his family to return to his self sufficient life style, he began to make his plans for the long trek west, the journey of more than one thousand miles that he would make to return home.    On the morning of his departure, as he carefully loaded his belongings back into the car, he saw the audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" carefully packed in the box he had placed on the back seat. This time, on this leg of his journey, he thought, he really was going to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" At last, he was ready to listen attentively. And so he reached behind the seat and into the box to pull out the album that contained the collection of CD's that was the recording of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" He carefully placed it on the front seat of the car, within arms reach, and then placed beside it the portable CD player that he had brought along just for that purpose. Yes. Today he would listen to \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" and began at once to feel a strong sense of anticipation for the reading.    But the driving conditions were poor that morning, with clouds and wind and rain and generally bad weather threatening to make the driving difficult. For that reason, he feared that, if his attention were diverted from the recorded performance by the strain of driving, he would fail in his endeavor to make a success of the reading of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" Furthermore, in case he became too involved in the story, he was somewhat frightened at the thought of having his attention averted from the road during a difficult traffic maneuver, thus putting himself in danger of an accident. For this reason, for both of these reasons, for all of these reasons, in fact, he decided to postpone his reading of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" until after he had passed over the mountains of South and North Carolina and had descended onto the plains of eastern Tennessee, where the road gradually wound down out of the mountains and gently stretched across nearly 400 miles of fertile farmland to the Mississippi River, and beyond. Making one last stop to say farewell to his mother, he carefully guided the car out onto the highway and began the difficult journey through the mountains.    The drive was indeed difficult, and the pavement, wet because of the clouds and the wind and the rain and the generally bad weather, and the heavy traffic, and the condition of the highway, which wound slowly up the steep mountain sides and then plunged down quickly, deep into the valleys, where the road ran alongside rushing rivers swollen with newly fallen rain, impeded his progress and required that he concentrate fully on the road.    On one occasion, he came upon the flashing lights of a police cruiser and an ambulance, and surreptitiously glanced at the accident and its victims as he crept by, his progress hampered by the traffic backup. Someone may have died here, he reflected, and wondered what his own fate would be if he failed to negotiate the mountain roads successfully. But no, he conceded, such a circumstance was unlikely, and he drove on. As he drove, he recalled from time to time the empty seat next to him, the seat empty of a passenger, but in which he had placed his audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" and anticipated in his mind the time when he would be able to listen to it and give it his full attention.    Finally, after three intense hours of driving through the steep mountains in the rain and the wind and the generally bad weather, he crossed from North Carolina into Tennessee. A short time later, he stopped at the first rest stop which appeared alongside the highway. And after taking a moment to refresh himself, he was able to relax and feel the stress of driving through the mountains in bad weather begin to melt away. In a few moments, he was renewed and invigorated and climbed back into his car to continue his journey.He re-entered the highway and joined the swiftly flowing stream of traffic driving west along the Interstate. Gradually, just as he knew it would, the road left the mountains and descended onto the gently rolling plains of eastern Tennessee. With a sigh of relief, and knowing that the trip would quickly assume a familiar routine, he settled back for the long drive that would take him through Knoxville, and Nashville, and Memphis, and Little Rock, before turning south towards Shreveport, bringing him finally to his destination, Dallas.    Now, he decided. Yes. Now is the time to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"    Awkwardly, while keeping his eyes on the road, he reached over to the passenger seat, found the CD player, and clumsily hooked it up. Then, fumbling around again until he found the album that contained the audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" he opened it and extracted the first CD, which he placed, still somewhat awkwardly, for it is tricky to manage a CD player and drive at the same time, into the player. He punched the button on the machine, adjusted the volume, and the words floated out of the speakers and into the car.    \\"'To the Lighthouse'\\" by Virginia Woolf. Disk One,\\" came the announcer's voice. Then the reader, Virginia Leishman, intoned: \\"Prologue. Chapter One.\\"    He began to listen, and he listened for the next 800 miles, and, listening intently, he immersed himself in Virginia Woolf's story of the Ramsay family, their summer vacation on the Isle of Skye, and their son James' much anticipated and long delayed journey to the lighthouse.    \\"Well done,\\" he thought, two days later, when it was finished. And he was pleased as he congratulated himself in his own private way, because he had listened to \\"To the Lighthouse\\" in its entirety, and found it enjoyable.    Thus, he put the finishing touch on his trip, the trip that was his Christmas vacation.    ***    A short time afterwards, only a few days, really, he reflected on his experience of reading \\"To the Lighthouse\\" as an audio book.    The trick to reading Virginia Woolf, he decided, is in knowing where to break the sentences, where to pause, and where to separate the subordinate clauses, so that the sentences parse correctly. If one does this incorrectly, as often happens on first reading of the printed page, the effect can be jarring, when, for example, a noun is unfortunately connected with the wrong verb, causing the sentence to go in the wrong direction, or parts of the sentence are left dangling. If such a thing happens, and it is likely to happen often on a first reading, the only solution for the reader is to re-read the sentence until it parses correctly, and the proper meaning emerges. This makes for slow going at first, when reading printed text, but if one can get the knack of the Woolf style, and if the reader perseveres, and is willing to make the effort to do a second reading whenever necessary, the inherent beauty of the text will soon emerge.    This unfortunate problem is nearly absent when one listens to the story read aloud as an audio book. On the recording, the reader, in this case Virginia Leishman, on the audio book version of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" published by Recorded Books, Inc., has of necessity, already analyzed the material, and the sentences as they are read have an ebb and flow of natural speech that is eminently satisfying. Also, the text takes on a transparent, poetic quality, as of carefully constructed blank verse, which allows the listener's imagination to free itself from the printed page, visualize in the mind's eye the situations and places described in the story, and immerse itself in the thoughts, emotions and utterances of Virginia Woolf's characters.     Listing to Virginia Woolf's prose, when read aloud and properly delivered, is both soothing and exciting. Her story, with the most sketchy of plots, and carefully constructed out of the most mundane of events of daily life, the painting of a picture, sewing, shopping, a chance encounter on the road, the preparation of a meal, and the chit chat of diners sitting at table, becomes both engaging and exciting to the listener, who feels himself becoming involved as part of the inner being of the various characters as they engage themselves in the shifting scene around them and react to the situations they encounter. Even if the mind occasionally wanders while the reading continues, it does not matter much, for in such cases, the listener's inner voice will merely merge into the texture of the tale, while the subconscious mind will continue listening to the words being read aloud, and quickly pull one back into the story after only a short moment.    The plot of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a simple one.    The story begins in the year 1910. The Ramsay family is on vacation from London and living in a cottage they own in Scotland, on the Isle of Skye. There are eight children in the family. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay have also invited several guests to join them for the summer.    James, Mrs. Ramsay's youngest son, who is six, asks if they can go to the lighthouse the next day. Mrs. Ramsay agrees, but Mr. Ramsay contradicts his wife and tells his son the weather will be bad. James is very disappointed.    That evening there is a dinner party, and the next morning, the weather is indeed wrong for a boat trip to the lighthouse.    10 years pass. Mrs. Ramsay has died of unknown causes, Andrew, the oldest son, has been killed in World War I, and Prue, the oldest daughter, has died in childbirth after a short marriage. The Ramsay cottage on the Isle of Sky falls into ruin.    The year is now 1920. Mr. Ramsay decides to come back to the cottage for the summer one more time. The cottage is quickly put in order, and Mr. Ramsay arrives with James and his sister Cam and a few guests.     During this stay, Mr. Ramsay decides to take James to the lighthouse. James, who is now 16, guides the boat through the billowing waves, so that the group arrives safely. \\"Well done,\\" says Mr. Ramsey to James when they arrive safely at the lighthouse, and James is secretly pleased to receive this simple declaration of praise from his demanding father. Finally, James has had his visit to the lighthouse. It is a moment of intense satisfaction for the reader.
B000ROALCG|5.0|The music in this CD sounds better than the original probably because of better acoustics in recording studios nowadays.  Regardless, it sounds great.  Like some other reviewer said, the more I hear this CD the more I like it.  As you know, usually the original singer has the advantage.  In this case it was Hector, so there could be no comparison.  However, my greatest disappoinment was to hear Marc trying to sound like Hector and limiting his own awesome singing style which is very different but one of the best.  What I wanted to hear was Marc's interpretation and soneo of these songs. I would like to hear Marc record other of Hector's songs with his own voice and his own style.  Of course it would not be the same.  But think of Hector trying to sing Ahora a Quien, Celos, Te Conozco Bien, or Hasta que te conoci. He would not match Marc's voice or soneos. Marc has also revived the music of Rafael Hernandez for younger generations.  Hector, Ismael,Ismael M., Ruben, Marvin, Cheo, Gilberto, and Marc are the salsa greats.  For you salsa hardcores (like me) accept this reality and you would accept that this is a great CD.    BOTTOMLINE:  This CD is great.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is, of course, one of the best albums of all time.  It places alongside any of the great ones, from any genre.  Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" comes to mind as a similar groundbreaking and note-perfect album.  But I would like to use this forum to say a few words about Ringo Starr, probably the most underrated (if rated at all) drummer of all time.  Now I know that Ringo is a Beatle, and so needs no further defense than that.  However, because I have of late heard so many music listeners misjudge him, I feel the need to offer a defense.       This album is a perfect example of Starr's impeccable melodic drumming.  I think there is a reason that so many people misjudge him.  His genius is not in his songwriting or singing, which are the most obvious places to make a good impression; likewise, it is not in his beats-per-measure or in the fact that he can play in a 13/9 time signature (the marks of many \\"progressive\\" drummers.)  No, Ringo's genius lies elsewhere:  His drums are nothing less than another expressive voice in this embarrassingly-well voiced band.  Like McCartney's melodic bass lines, Harrison's economic guitar solos (another one who never makes the list of \\"Best Guitarists\\" because he doesn't use fireworks), Lennon's biting rhythm guitar, and both Paul's and John's expressive singing, Starr's drumming is a distinctive voice, an extension of him as a person.    You can recognize this voice in one measure, and from a mile away.  This type of musical \\"voice\\" can only be cultivated with years of practice and mountains of talent.       Just listen to the melody of the drums on the opener \\"Come Together.\\"  Listen to the seamlessness of the bass and drums.  They make a song all by themselves.  Hear Ringo's kit sing on the ballad \\"Something\\"--could you add or subtract even one hit without upsetting that performance?  I do not think I need to go any further to entice you to listen again to this entire album, or to any of their albums.  I guarantee, infact, that listening to them with an ear to the drums will be like hearing them again for the first time.       Among all the things that Abbey Road is, and to so very many people, let it be a testament to this great musician.  (N.B.  Because someone is destined to bring this up, let me also address the fact that Ringo did not play on the original recording of \\"Love Me Do.\\"  The fact is that Pete Best, the original drummer, couldn't play the song correctly on the first try.  When the band went back into the studio to re-record it, they had already replaced Best with Starr.  However, The producer George Martin did not want to take a chance again, and so paid a studio musician to lay down the track.  This had nothing to do with Starr's technical ability.)
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I hated the trailer and went into the movie thinking i would hate the movie. The movie was really good. It took me 20 minutes to get over my preconceptions, after that i really enjoyed it. The movie is much better than the trailer, give it a chance
0061547832|3.0|I read somewhere that Mr. Trump's father left him 5,000 rental units in prime New York City. I would really like to know what the value of those 5,000 units would be worth today; that is, what Mr. Trump's net worth would be had he done NOTHING but ride the market as opposed to saying he created all this wealth on his own. And I am NOT being coy, but Mr. Trump at some point must acknowledge what he inherited. And if I inherited millions, I too would be walking around with confidence galore.    That issue aside, this book is basically shallow. \\"Don't give up.\\" \\"Be prepared to fight.\\" \\"Don't lose focus.\\"    Towards the end, he lambasts Geraldo for blabbing who Geraldo has slept with, and I agree: Geraldo dropped the ball there, like anyone even cares. But behind this \\"respect\\" for women and their attraction to his confidence (true--women love confident men), I somehow can't get his calling Rosie a fat pig out of my mind.....    In so many ways, Mr. Trump is a man's man. This is a rah-rah cheerleading book. In order to understand the fundamentals and the brand, we have to know where to find those initial millions just like he did. And maybe like Kerry's military medals, it's time for Mr. Trump to come clean on those facts.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Movie:  This is my favorite modern day bond. (Sorry Pierce)  It has many subplots that will keep you wondering who bond needs to be pointing he gun at (or bluffing with).  The contrast of action and character building makes this a well rounded film.     Movie: The mastering on this film was absolutly brilliant.  The best of all the blu-ray's I currently own.  Color Representation is great as well.    Audio: The PCM Audio with this movie is great.  There is also a lot of good mixing to add to the tension of the various scenes.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|This is one of the best horror movies of the 1980's.  That being said starz could have done a better job cleaning up the grainy picture.  It is still a improvement over the standard dvd release though.  Therefore it is a welcome addition to my collection. However I am going to email starz and ask them why at the more expensive prices of blu ray that they don't treat each release like a special edition.  After all few of us are going to replace this version with a new blu ray version that costs 40.00 just to get deleted scenes.  At this price all blu rays should be treated as special editions and deliver any deleted scenes that such a edition would have.  Starz is not the only company doing this either.  So it is worth the effort to email any studio and say that if you expect us to pay these higher prices, then we should expect it to be released  like a special edition.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks is still a sweet, tearjerker, and honest film about a man who may not have all his marbles intact but his sweet nature and common sense make him special wherever he goes. Great performance by Hanks, Robin Wright, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise. I can see why the Academy Awards gave this movie the best picture nod. This film will touch your heart and make you laugh for sure. I highly recommend it!
0618680004|5.0|I bought The God Delusion because I saw Dawkins on TV and liked what he had to say. The God Delusion is a very intense, interesting and enlightening book. I recommend it often.
B00005ASOI|4.0|In my opinion the brilliance within this film comes from its truly original style and unique haunting atmosphere. The cinematography in Suspiria appealed to me, Dario uses death in this film like a work of art and is very experimental in the way he kills his characters off, i get this impression from the colors and tones of the blood and gore which he uses in his killings and oddly although being a very haunting horror film it was quite nice on the eyes, the visuals are fantastic!<br /><br />The lighting within this film was a revolution and has much influence on a lot of the films seen today especially in the horror genre. The constant lighting changes within this film dances with brilliantly orchestrated sound tracks much in a way that gave me a sence of hell on earth and also appealed to me amongst some of the best horror music i've heard. The film has a very demonic like atmosphere.<br /><br />I notice some of the other reviews in line comment that although visually fantastic they take the film as boring, but i just have to add that this film is anything but boring and easily deserves its place amongst some of the best films of all time. This is a MUST see for all film lovers,, brilliant!
1591841666|5.0|I was in my favorite hang out place Barnes and Nobles and I picked up this little book. I sat down and read the whole book and than I bought it to high lite it as is my custom and will read it again. It is a small book, but very powerful and I loved that.  It is so right on as far as how we are as people and how we do things or don't. Winners win because they make a decision and hang in there until they get it done. It tells you how to know when to QUIT. Most people will and that is the beauty of how things work. Show up, prepare, serve and choose the right vehicle and you can WIN no matter what you choose. Be Passionate and Good!  F. DeTiege NJ  PFS is where it's at!!!!
0967175429|5.0|I am a healing practitioner and Theta Healing is a very powerful technique.  I think anyone with some previous healing, and meditation training can learn the technique from the book.  The beauty of Theta Healing is that it is not running energy, as Reiki is, but having Creator heal.  I found it a very interesting book and method of healing which I am going to incorporate in my practice.
0375842381|5.0|It is pretty rare when you can't put the book down, but you have to because the story is just that intense.  The suspense is on par with Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure I'll enjoy reading this more than once!    I was somewhat reluctant to buy the series, seeing it was classified as \\"children's adventure\\", but it is really suited well for adults too.
B0002FR07O|5.0|I like to categorize \\"Signify\\" as the first CD of the modern era of Porcupine Tree.  It is quite different from their previous efforts up to this point, yet stunning in it's creativity.  The first hints of metal would weave it's way into the album, especially with the title track \\"Signify\\", a trait that the band continues to this day.  There is a wealth of classic material to be found on this one.  The album contains more vocal tracks than ever before, but also features plenty of instrumental stuff as well.  Songs like \\"Sleep Of No Dreaming\\", \\"Waiting\\", \\"Sever\\", and \\"Intermediate Jesus\\" have become classics in the Porcupine Tree catalogue.  This album is another essential must own for fans of the band.
B00004XONN|2.0|More than 7 years have gone since this record was released and I still don't get it. I don't get the average Radiohead fan hype about something so daring and original, which it is, but in all honesty Kid A doesn't give me the one bit of thrill, emotion and the desire to keep listening to an album over and over again like it did with OK Computer. I've spent years and years expecting this album to \\"grow on me\\" because that's what everybody's been telling, and still Kid A is remains collecting dust in my shelf, and I've given it more than enough chances to prove me wrong.
6304806434|5.0|I try to purchase only movies that I know I will want to see enough that their price will outweigh the rental fees.  This is one of them.  Good action movie.
B000XCZGVI|5.0|Video quality & audio quality are 100% awesome; this movie just does Hi Def right. The plot of the movie is great, the extras are even better. There is nothing about this movie that I do not like; it's just flat out amazing.     I extremely/highly recommend this movie to anybody.   It's worth buying a brand new HD DVD player just to watch it.     Anybody rates this movie bellow 4.5 does not know anything about the nature of this film.    Best Regards,
B00005JPTI|1.0|The three memorable things about this dead-in-the-water adaptation of a classic science-fiction novel is that it stars a charismatic black actor, the only other survivor in the story is an ethnic South American woman, and the 'baddie', so to speak, is a WASP doctor. That's pretty subversive stuff for Hollywood. Unfortunately, the rest of the film does not live up to expectations. It is an empty CGI extravaganza that possesses not an ounce of genuine emotion. Most distressing of all, it takes the highly ironic title of the novel and turns it into an unconvincing heroic final gesture. Like 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', 'I am Legend' is novel about loneliness and the insignificance of man in the vastness of the cosmos. In these two novels, Matheson is saying that man will not go out with a bang but a whimper, an unnoticed sigh. But that does not sit well with the noisy mentality of the blockbuster genre where noisy special effects attempt to fill the void and fail spectacularly.
B000002GB4|5.0|As a long-term STYX fan, I found myself playing this 1976 release more often than the others. I found it highly upbeat from the opening tracks(\\"Put Me On\\"- \\"Mademoiselle\\"), which always made me feel good. It ends with a romantic Dennis De Young composition- \\"Clair De Lune/Ballerina\\", which showcases Dennis's writing tallents- who else could write a beautiful love(rock)song to tie in with Debussey's classical masterpiece? Five,no SIX Stars!
B000W00Y0O|5.0|The video and Audio blow away the Blu-ray version. If you have a choice, go HD-DVD.
0345479092|5.0|This is the best baby book--and I read them all!! Why?  1. All the books say \\"put baby in bed drowsy but awake\\"--she's the only person who actually describes what that means, and how to get there.  AND THAT is invaluable insight.  2. The dictionary of baby cries, and baby body language is so helpful and useful, especially for first time parents.    My daughter has colic, and some of the advice here really helped reduce it, but mainly helped me deal with it.  The advice on breastfeeding is excellent, and she's not presumptious or holier than thou about it. With time, and following the routine as much as possible, my baby has been sleeping through the night (ie 7 hours) from 8 weeks...     Two thumbs up
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Got this for my husband for Christmas. He had seen them on PBS and wanted a CD.  He likes to listen to it when he goes to bed at night. Now I am hooked on this music as much as he is. It is a soothing sound that is nice to hear at the end of a long day, or whenever you feel stressed. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys music.
B000063Y8F|3.0|This garlic press worked great for about 3 months--it easily crushed garlic pushing out everything leaving the peels. However, after 3 months one of the rivots holding the hinge broke with no way to fix. At that point the press became useless.    I would buy it again in a heartbeat if I knew it wouldn't break again.
B000X418UE|4.0|This is generally a port over of the Criterion Collection DVD release, with the film in 1080p high definition. Picture quality of the feature is a bit soft, but then again the movie is 11 years old. The included 5.1 Dolby Digital track is nice, the PCM 5.1 is probably better, but I do not have that ability on my system.    Special features are in 408i/p.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Although I'm not one of those people who line up and go see every James Bond movie, I generally find the films in the franchise to be fun and exciting. Casino Royale is best one I've seen. Daniel Craig is a tremendously talented actor, and brings new depth to the character - aided by the fact that this movie brings the debut of Bond as 007, and his meeting with Vesper Lynd, the woman who will steal his heart and mark him forever. With fabulous locations (Lake Como looks breathtaking), and a fantastic supporting cast (Eva Green is gorgeous, and Judi Dench is brilliant as always) Casino Royale delivers two hours of glamour, excitement and so much fun.

B000002IKR|5.0|testament debut album was something that really stand out not only for themselves but in thrash metal scene, the band was formed 5-6 years before this album was released no wonder you can clearly notice the complexity of each songs, its really outstanding compare to debut album of let say... exodus, slayer & anthrax.  it has everything, th speed, great riff and great melody both on guitar and vocal. There's only 1 or 2 weak tracks on this album. Just listen to burnt offerings, over the wall, apocalyptic city and first strike still deadly or perhaps the most melodic tune alone in the dark. Testament is up there with megadeth, slayer, metallica, anthrax & exodus as the big 5!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|To be short, this album is a collection of songs, and not a concept album. Most of these songs rank among the best Dream Theater has ever created. All of them feature absolutely mind-bottling displays of instrumental virtuosity from each band member. If you love max-speed guitar-keyboard synchronized lead work, this is the best ever. If you're a fan of DT but wish their balls would drop, this is when they finally did. All in all, a masterful performance by the kings of Prog Metal.
0810993139|5.0|(This was written by a third grader- JK)    Diary of a Whimpy Kid is a very funny kid's book.  The book is about a guy named Greg.  I think it will be good for anyone who likes funny comics.  Greg tells about months of him being wimpy.  I really recommend this book.

B0002Y4TM4|3.0|I bought this disc after really liking Brave and Misplaced Childhood. This album suffers from lackluster vocals and the absence of any spark from the rest of the band. The music on it's own instrumentally is very good but not strong enough to win me over. Sounds a lot like Coldplay (not a good thing). This one will gather some dust in my collection I'm afraid. - Ciao
0743297334|2.0|I had high hopes for this book being that it was from Hemingway and regarded so highly by so many people. But I just dont get it. The metaphors and whatnot are not lost on me. But they arent that profound. Not only does this book not really say anything as you're reading it, I mean nothing happens in this book, but the message that it is trying to deliver is not so hot either. I like to read books that say something profound about humanity. When I read a book I like for my thoughts to run wild with new ideas and understanding about mankind. This book was a chore and delivered none of this. I've read the positive reviews here, but this stuff that people point out just isnt that fun or interesting to read. The point that the book makes could be made in one chapter, or could be a side point to a more interesting tale. I give it two stars instead of one because I was able to finish it (although perhaps that was because I expected to eventually be rewarded and it wasnt that long).
0788815490|3.0|Yes, this should be dismissed as a \\"chick flick,\\" for that is indeed what it is.  A three hankie, extremely long soap opera.  The costumes and sets are excellent, and the acting is fine.  The scenes taken in Venice are largely wasted, however, as they appear on screen for only seconds.  The steamy sex scene near the film's conclusion shows conclusively that Helena Bonham Carter can act!  On the whole, this is an irritating waste of time.

My wife could barely tell the difference. Still, it is better than the dvd version. If you can find it for a decent price, get it. Just don't break the bank over this one.
B000J10EQU|3.0|I didn't go into this film with any expectations, and ultimately I thought it carried the torch fairly well, in spirit.  There was enough overlap from the original film to fill in the storyline without clinging unnecessarily to its coattails.  Whether the story progression in this film would align with the comic universe itself...  I have my doubts.  If you are a stickler for the die hard comic characters, this film will not live up to your expectations.<br /><br />I did not find Brandon Routh to be a particularly stand out talent. I've never seen him in anything else.  He seemed to be moving along the plot without making any real contribution.  Spacey and Parker were quite the caricatures of their roles, all but stealing the film for their villainous depictions. Even with them, though, I felt like they were doing the best they could with a weak script.  Bosworth played a fairly subdued Lane, but in the end she came across more one-dimensional to me than just hyper focused on her work ethic while trying to hide a fiery passion for blue tights.  In fact,  she came off flat out cold in her interactions with her son, the enigma of which is deciphering who his real father is. With that interjection of doubt shadowing the little one you would think that with all this overwhelming love we are supposed to believe that she feels, that she would show a little more compassion to her son.  The majority of the characters were so bland that in the end I found myself not really caring if some of the principals didn't make it.  In fact, it would have been more in keeping with the canon storyline if...  well.  You just have to see it.<br /><br />The plot moved somewhat slowly in the middle, with quite a few leaps in logic (or flat out misinterpretations of the original Superman mythos) conveying it through its shallow and open climax.  There were no particularly dazzling special effects but the CGI maintained the comic vividness rather well.  Honestly I spent most of this film working out contradictions in my mind regarding collective consciousness, archetypes and which came first--the broken planet or the displaced hero, but I wouldn't expect those to convey well in a film review.  =)tradictions in my mind regarding collective consciousness, archetypes and which came first--the broken planet or the displaced hero, but I wouldn't expect those to convey well in a film review.  =)
B000UR9TPK|5.0|Hello there,it's a real bummer that the Blu Ray Disc release of Led Zeppelin's \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is no longer in print(the 2-DVD set that was released at the same time seems also to have been recalled,Wow!,I have that one too),it seems to have been recalled and pulled of shelves for some reason!!! I was lucky enough to find a new/sealed copy at retail store(won't name),I got the last copy,and if you can find one still,it's an awesome Blu Ray title!!! This OOP(out of print) Blu Ray disc is already fetching high dollars on online auction sites such as Ebay!!! This might the rarest Blu Ray title out there!!! The picture and sound quality are awesome for a film of this vintage,and the extras are awesome(it seems have the same extras as the 2-DVD set has)too!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!! A+

B000UFAURI|5.0|I have been a fan of the Foo Fighters since their self-titled debut when I was in high school.  I have always felt an under-current within the music and lyrics.  It was as though the band was afraid to be too deep, so they would always change it up half way through.  Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace feels like the dam breaking...finally!!!  It has been happening for some time with them, especially pronounced in the two disc masterpiece In Your Honor, but with this album, it is like a flood.  These songs are for soul searching and reflection and it feels like a pay-off for all of the fans that have been waiting for the inundation.  This album stands in good company with only a few others that I consider to be truly remarkable.
B000W07EKW|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  We had a movie marathon on a stormy day and watched all 3.  Had forgotten how good the first 2 were, and seeing the Ultimatum brought it all together.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|According to Remy's ethereal companion Gusteau, anyone can cook. However, only the wizards at Pixar and Brad Bird could could cook up such a savory blend of humor, wit, and charm in Ratatouille, which takes an absurd premise and runs (or more appropiately scurries) with it. If your reading this then chances are that by now you know the gist of the movie. Rat aspires to cook. Rat uses inept garbage boy as the vehicle to create his culinary concoctions at struggling Paris restaurant and gets customers raving. Head chef gets paranoid over garbage boy's newfound cooking talents and investigates. Comedy, and at times, calamity ensue. So do yourslef a favor...stop reading all these contrived food metaphors used to describe how good this movie really is and experience Pixar's latest dish for yourself (Sorry, had to get in one more).

B000002AH1|5.0|For a more in-depth review read the other reviews on Live-Evil. Only I would suggest that one take the \\"Get The Cellar Door Sessions Instead\\" comments with a grain of salt.     I have Cellar Door, and actually listened to it BEFORE I listened to this 2 CD collection of Live Evil which contains some of the highlights of the Cellar Door sessions. By all means try out the Cellar Door Sessions, but DON'T MISS OUT ON LIVE-EVIL!    To the last reviewer who complained about John McLaughlin's playing being \\"sloppy\\", telling the audience you're a guitarist isn't good enough, dude. I mean, I listened to this and it is exactly what John McLaughlin was playing in 1970. It is some awesome stuff, I believe. The raw live version of \\"What I Say\\", that is also played various times again in different shows on the Cellar Door Sessions only withough John Mclaughlin, is worth hearing, but it is totally sublime on both Live-Evil, and on Cellar Door.     So, what do you want to do? Do you want to do? Do you want to pay minimum of $60 on Cellar Door and hear every version of every song played on those shows in Winter 1970, mostly without John McLaughlin, or do you want to buy a more reasonably-priced double cd-set of Live-Evil that contains the highlights of Cellar Door with John on guitar? Pick your poison, either one is excellent. There are some extra cuts on Live Evil that aren't on Cellar Door, though. It is interesting to hear the Keith Jarret organ along with Herbie on Piano on Selim and elsewhere.     You can hear the birth of Jazz/Rock on Live-Evil. And, if you don't like Airto then you're dismissing Miles choice to put Airto in the band. Teo did some editing, yes, but Miles was there when the editing happened. Miles put his rubber stamp on Teo's studio trickery so listen and learn.     Don't let these 3-star naysayers prevent you from purchasing an incredible, seminal version of Miles Davis in the birth of the Electric Miles era. It is highly recommended. Not too structured, though, very organic--just right.
B000TGJ8IU|4.0|The new director's cut of Troy might at over 3 hours be rather long to have been sitting in a cinema, but for home theatre, this is now finally the movie punters wished it could be when it first came out.  The extra scenes - a mixture of character moments and action scenes, truly change it from a bit of a muddle, to something approaching classic status.  The battle scenes add little, but the character scenes change and explain the dynamics of the characters, in particular Sean Bean's Odysseus, and the tension between King Agamemnon and Achilles.  There is still a problem with the casting... no-one really looks that comfortable in their roles, neither Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and certainly not Orlando Bloom.  Only Peter O'Toole really fits the part, at least as much of a part as he is given.  Diane Kruger looks pretty, but whether it is the script, or her acting, it is difficult to say - but she never quite seems worth putting a thousand ships to sea for.  That aside, the battle scenes are visceral, and if this movie added anything new, it was the mano-a-mano battles with Achilles, which are terrifically well choreographed to make you really believe in his invincibility.  Extras are prolific - I gave up before I managed to exhaust all the topics, which are conveniently arranged in segments a few minutes long, so you can either watch all together or search for just the parts which interest.  A worthy package which goes some way to restoring the reputation of this previously maligned movie.

B000LY4KWO|4.0|This was Bond back as fun, not serious - and a successful transition it turned out to be. It is hardly the reimagining it seemed back then, more of a return to the tongue in cheek of Roger Moore - except this time with an actor who could pull it off.  There's lots to like - Famke Jensen is one of the most deliciously over the top hench(wo)man in decades, Sean Bean plays 006 with great style, and there are surprising cameos - Robbie Coltrane, Minnie Driver, for example. Eric Serra's synth-rich score works pretty well, with enough of the classic themes coming through at moments you want them to - like the start of the glorious tank chase. And let's not forget two of Goldeneye's key successes - Judi Dench as M was certainly surprising casting, but it turned out to add a hugely successful character foil to Bond's `misogynist dinosaur'. Aside from Judi Dench bringing the role of women in Bond movies into the modern world, Isabella Scorupco plays a fine traditional Bond girl, with added sassiness. And then there is that whole self aware aspect - Bond is recognised for being a `relic of the cold war', and there is even a few half heartedly psychological moments where Gasp! We are encouraged to understand the character a little better.  Locations are the best in some time for a Bond movie, with St Petersburg appearing in person... surely the ultimate sign the cold war has ended, when a Russian city appears in a Bond movie without Prague or some other Eastern European city standing in for it...  Negative points if you want to quibble... there's something about Bond with a machine gun that's just not right. Bond is supposed to be pinpoint and precise, and it's a shame the Brosnan movies got away from that to have him spraying bullets all over the place. And a few of the characters are just a bit too cartoonish, drawing one out from an otherwise well paced and well plotted movie.  All in all though, there's no doubt that Pierce Brosnan's first stab at the Bond role made it hisown for a decade. Goldeneye is one of those perennially entertaining and rewatchable movies that made the Bond franchise so durable.    As usual, the ultimate edition has every extra imaginable, significantly more than the previous Special Edition. Sadly however, we do not have the making of documentary that accompanied all of the previous movies. It's a shame that for this ultimate edition they could not have put together some sort of retrospective documentary with interviews as they had for the previous movies, and merely put together all the pre-existing material they could find.  Picture and sound are immaculate.

B00003CXCW|5.0|This is the stuff of legends. I watched it last night with my wife who had never seen it before, I had seen it once and it is even a more powerful movie experience then I remember. We were glued to the tv screen by this intriguing screen classic. Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson) is a screen icon from the days of silent movies who now lives in the past unable to face a present where the movies no longer need her, she waits for the call from Paramount Studios that will turn her back into a star. Gloria Swanson gives one of the most memorable screen performances you will ever see. Her Norma Desmond scares you, moves you and enthralls you as you wait for this train wreck to happen. Joe Gillis(William Holden) is from a small town in Ohio who is possibly a day or so away from returning to the copy desk at the small Ohio newspaper that he came from. His dreams of striking it big in Hollywood now a frazzled scorn of cynical delusions. The Hollywood sharks have worn him out. Norma's fate and his are intertwined forever when Joe gets a flat as he tries to elude the repo men who are trying to take his car. He's so broke and unable to sell any of his stories or screenplays that he hasn't paid rent in three months. He ends up at Norma's mansion on Sunset Blvd. that has all the appearances of being abandoned. Norma seemingly has found a new lease on life as she hires Joe to edit and finish her \\"masterpiece\\" of a screenplay eventually falling in love with him. Joe takes advantage of Norma at first strictly for the money but eventually the attraction grows not so much because of the physical attraction of the two but Joe realizes no matter how crazy this whole setup is and how much he dislikes being Norma's \\"boytoy\\", Norma has treated him better then anyone else in Hollywood that he's run across. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is the glue holding it all together as he devotes himself to giving Norma what she needs to keep her illusions alive while holding his own secrets. A masterful performance. A masterful legendary film. We lived in Hollywood for a few years and I think that's what made this film so much more poignant for me the second time because Hollywood is full of Norma Desomnds drowning in quiet desperation who should've packed up and found a different life years ago. But how can one let go of being a star? Not that easy.mance. A masterful legendary film.

We are all mentally ill to some degree so I don't know why we abhor it.

0374530718|3.0|Summary  Sophie's World is about a girl called Sophie who lives in Norway. For the last 14 years, she has been living a normal life, but she begins to receive from a mysterious person letters which state questions which challenge her outlook on seemingly everything. Soon Sophie is learning about the history of philosophy from the earliest mythologies of mankind to the most modern thinkers of our time. Little does Sophie know that this information could also be crucial to her very existence...  Critique  Sophie's World is not like most novels. Most of the story is made up of Sophie's correspondence with her philosophy teacher, which is itself mainly read like a history book. I personally found Sophie's World much more interesting and well written than the average text-book, and I also found the information given captivating and fun to read about. I enjoyed this book greatly.  Literary Analysis  At least 70% of Sophie's World is essentially a history test in the form of a dialogue between Sophie and her teacher. Also, while Jostein Gaarder wrote this book in a 3rd person narrative style, almost the whole extent o the book focuses on Sophie and her thoughts, which can be monotonous at times. Besides the sometimes monotonous character of the reader hearing most of Sophie's thoughts, the information given is still very interesting and is worth reading.  Recommendation  I would recommend this Sophie's world to anyone who enjoys learning new information, but not to those who read novels for their plot and character development. While Sophie's World is filled to the brim of fascinating facts, the storyline and characters play a more subordinate role in the book.

1416914285|5.0|Before reading this book, I had spent about a year trying to find new, interesting-sounding books at my local bookstores, then reading them through my library.  Unfortunately, this wasn't going to well, with such mishaps as Troy, Resurrection Men, I'd Tell You That I Love You But Then I'd Have To Kill You, and Eragon.  Needless to say, I was beginning to lose hope that I would ever find a good YA book again, without the help of a personal recommendation from one of my friends.  And then (of course) I picked this one up.    I've seen that many people on Amazon found this book to be boring, stereotypical, etc.  I beg to differ.  From almost the first page, I was hooked on this book, and hardly put it down until I'd finished.  The characters were engaging, the dialogue and prose both carried me along without a hitch (and made me laugh, so double points there), and the plot twist actually surprised me.  (Recently I've gotten used to being able to predict the endings of every YA book I read once I hit page 50, so that was a big deal for me.)  Now, maybe it's because I don't read a lot of demon-hunter books, but I thoroughly enjoyed the world created in this story, and I didn't feel that I'd really read anything like it before.    Speaking as someone who reads nearly all-fantasy, who expects a lot out of a book, and who thought that YA fiction had nothing more to give, I really do believe this book to be absolutely fabulous.  I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I have always felt that this is the better of the Batman movies, simply because it does more to explain how Bruce Wayne became the bat man. Nolan finally did an interpretation of the beginning that fans have wanted for a very long time.    Tim Burton did an excellent job on Batman and Batman Returns (the Danny DeVito portrayal of the Penguin still makes my skin crawl.), however when Joel Shumacher was brought on board, it was pretty much the death knell for this franchise. The people who wrote the scripts for the Schumacher films need to be taken out and shot and those that allowed those films to be made need to be shot as well....or perhaps some electro shock therapy would help?

The smokey, polluted LA is still there, but the edges are sharp like a cold, clear winter day.

Brilliant stuff.
0307346617|5.0|First of all, I'm a big fan of the zombie subgenre.  Whether it be movies or books, I find the idea both intriguing and comical.  From beginning to end, Brooks managed to keep my attention with tales from various characters.  At times I was mouth-open in anticipation, and others falling off the chair from laughing.<br /><br />World War Z begins where his other hit (The Zombie Survival Guide) left off.  In the possibilities of the Survival Guide, we were left with many what-ifs.  Only, in this version we are taken into the future to discover how and why the zombie onslaught began.<br /><br />WWZ is a fictional timeline of the worldwide outbreak that has turned earth in a zombie playground.  It's written primarily in an interview format with different experts weighing in on how the outbreak began, what should have been done to stop it, what did and didn't work, and then how humanity eventually overcame the zombies.  The scope is wide-ranging, as doctors who noted early symptoms, pilots who flew over infested areas, politicians who regret not doing more to stop the events, and soldiers who waged war are all interviewed.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting and comical are the interviews with soldiers, who describe in vivid detail how the military employed losing tactics at first, with completely ignorant strategies that led to demoralizing defeats, as well as the reasons why the zombie army was such a difficult and worthy foe.  Afterwards, the soldier explains the turning point at which out-dated military strategy was scrapped in favor of innovative, successful ways which eventually turned the tide in humanity's favor.<br /><br />The soldier interviews also show a human element to the war, and the insanity that is brought on when fear and despair take over.  People irrationally battling one another, feeding on one another, and essentially helping the zombies by creating a divided force of \\"every man for himself\\", are all forseeable possibilities if a zombie outbreak ever did occur.  This is perhaps the book's strong-point: the ability to persuade a reader into pondering the what-ifs of an actual zombie outbreak, the tragedy, the terror, the horror.  To envision how humanity can change, how parentless children can become feral, how small communities can become pseudo-fascist enclaves, and how strong will and spirit eventually overcomes, is realistic despite the topic's preposterousness.<br /><br />Max Brooks' World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War is ubelievably believable.  Even though there is a bit of allusion to current-day events, and current problems with various government organization, the book manages to be elicit enough belief in the possibility of global political failure at the sight of a zombie epidemic.  World War Z shows our weaknesses, where humanity fails into pure emotion and reaction, and how it almost led to complete extinction.  It also shows our strengths, our resilience, and our intelligence, finishing on an upbeat tone that allows one to believe that for the greater good of humanity, people can ignore common differences and unite against a common enemy.<br /><br />This book is great.

B00005JLCI|5.0|This film was awesome at the time of its release and now ten years later, when it is finally released on DVD, time has not changed the impact of this full-length Hamlet.  It is great for a first-time Shakespeare experience or a wonderful reminder for life-long lovers of Shakespeare as to why he is considered a playwright that transcends time.  Kenneth Branagh is so superb in the lead role, and his very close supporting cast, seem born for the bard.  But nobody makes Shakespeare come alive like Kenneth Branagh, as a director, a producer, an actor or any combination of the three.  As Shakespeare had the Midas touch in his ability to make people, places and events become real, Branagh brings them to life. Not just in \\"Hamlet\\", but in other works he has brought to the silver screen.
184195425X|4.0|reading well into the novel (but before the doomed shipwreck), i forgot about the fact that the protagonist was supposed to be stranded out in the open sea with a tiger...<br /><br />and then came the part in which Pi was calling and urging for 'richard parker' to swim harder and to join him on the lifeboat amidst the churning waters, and his (pi's) reaction upon realizing what he had just done. god! i never felt that good about a novel for a long time. i laughed right out loud, the person next to me thought i was losing it. suffice to say, i seriously enjoyed yann martel's novel.<br /><br />there were times i felt like breaking down once i understood parts of the 'real' things that happened to pi, and times i was amused by the interplay between him and the disdainful tiger. when i think about it though, the early parts of their adventure were more engaging to read compared to the near end. but all-in-all, this novel is one i definitely labeled as \\"for keeps\\". sure to inspire, provoke, and touch...

This is worth every penny and is a must for Simon and Garfunkel and Paul Simon fans.
B000BCE918|4.0|Alright, this review is primarily for those who have read the books and watched the movies afterward...    First, in terms of the movies on a solo basis - the plot development particularly in Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3 was intriguing and captivating. The Lost world, on the other hand, left much to be desired. Solely based on the contiguity of the movie trilogy, the Lost World was by far the most poorly done and the most lacking in plot.    Now, each movie individually based on their overall quality and how they compare to the original two books (Jurassic Park and The Lost World, by Michael Chrichton). In the first movie, Jurassic Park, the beginning of the movie follows the book at least half-heartedly, but those who, like me, read the book and enjoyed it very much, were set up for disappointment right from the beginning. First of all, they completely switched the roles of Alexis and Tim. Tim becomes the younger child and the sports nut, while Alexis fills the role of the older child who is more computer savvy. Then, Dr. Grant is first shown with an adversity to children, which is contrary to the way he handles them in the book also. As the movie moved along, there were many other differences that were notable, in my mind at least, but personally I think the most disappointing part is where Muldoon gets killed by the raptors. I mean - come on! In the book, Muldoon is like the biggest and baddest of them all, and even the movie gives you a glimpse of the extensive knowledge he had gained about raptors and their hunting/feeding habits. Other notable differences include the survival of John Hammond, the growing relationship depicted between Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler, and several special effects.     In all fairness, the creators of the movie had no way to fully depict the psychological aspects found in the book - and the screenplay attempts to make up for this by creating other aspects of the plot, such as Grant's gradual acclimation to the presence of the children and the implied feelings that develop between Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler. There are also many other elements that are added throughout the movie to make it more accpetable for children, because - face it - children love dinosaurs - but Jurassic Park wasn't written to be a children's book. Therefore, to make it better for children, many changes had to be made in order for parents to want their children to see it. As with most movies that are adapted from books, the movie plot isn't about following the book closely, but about selling the movie to the audience they believe will be most interested.    I would give The Lost World 2 stars at the most - it was thoroughly disappointing to me. The book plot for The Lost World begins with Dr. Levine, a miraculously recovered Ian Malcolm, Sarah Harding, and two children (Arby and Kelly) who are students of Dr. Levine. The discovery of the island and the actual trip out there occur later in the book, with the earlier portions building up the information that leads to the main conflict and introducing you to several important aspects of the characters and plot. For instance, through Sarah Harding's perspective, you discover that Malcolm denies the entire incident at Isla Nublar, though experiencing frequent flashbacks to the events of Jurassic Park. Dodgson is a firm believer in the millions of dollars that a successful dinosaur park could make (his character, which also doesn't appear in \\"The Lost World\\" movie, is first introduced in the Jurassic Park book as a part of the company that is attempting to steal information from InGen). He brings a team out to the island, equipped with a large black box designed to keep dinosaurs at bay by emitting very high frequency sound waves. He arrives on the island shortly after Malcolm and his group, who come chasing Levine (who went out to the island as soon as he discovered it, then called back for help). The children - Arby and Kelly - hide in the reinforced trailers that are broughtover, and thus manage to get to the island despite Malcolm's insistence that they remain behind. When Dodgson and his group arrives, we see the same trend as in Jurassic Park, where everything is thrown into chaos and they find themselves struggling just to escape the island alive.    In the movie we see a completely different scene. The entire buildup is discarded and replaced with John Hammond (who, according to the books, is dead at this time, but survived in the movie)as a source of information concerning InGen's second site. Dr. Levine doesn't even appear in the movie, and Dodgson's character is replaced by a big game hunter who comes to the island to steal dinosaurs - not eggs. Also, rather than Levine coming to the island early, Sarah Harding is the one who appears early on the island in the movie - which totally ruins the scene where she comes out by boat to join them in the book, since at that time you first encounter Dodgson and the other group, who try to kill her by pushing her overboard during a storm. In my opinion, there was nothing they could do to rescue the movie after that point. Also, at the end they bring a Tyrannosaurus and her baby back to the city. This idea is much more far-fetched than the eggs that Dodgson's group was attempting to steal in the book. Also, Kelly is portrayed as Malcolm's Daughter rather than Levine's student, and Arby is completely omitted from the movie (which also eliminates the entire raptor chase - those who read the book will know what I'm talking about). The movie as a whole was a huge disappointment.    Jurassic Park 3 was better than The Lost World (by far), and since it was not based on any book, they couldn't totally screw the plot up. Dr. Grant reappears in this movie, and is convinced by a couple to come out to InGen's Site B. Here is another sequel that, had it not been for the previous two movies' complete departure from the books, would neve have been possible. Anywho, they arrive at the island, people get eaten (the guys with the guns go first), and eventually find some kid who's lived on the island for 8 weeks somehow - and here they're having problems surviving for a few days. There is very little character development - even less than in the previous two movies. There is little more to say about it - it was somewhat disappointing, but still far better than The Lost World.

0143038419|5.0|I waited for a long time before buying this book because of the reviews I read.  I braced myself for a story full of self centeredness and what I got was an inspiring spritual journey.  I think this book would be better for someone who is on a spiritual journey or someone with an open mind or a nonjudgmental one.  To the non spritual person this book could seem a bit selfish.  Ask yourself though why is it wrong for one to travel around and search for the meaning of ones true self?  Yes, the author could afford to not work and induldge in her travels, but she did gain some valuable insight in doing so.  She was forever transformed and so what if she wrote a book about it.  It is a wonderful story.  My favorite part was when she was in India.  Most people seemed to not be that interested in that part, but I think that it is the most important.  This book changed my life as I was longing for more in my own.  I am now on a spiritual path and am finally beginning to feel true happinness and love.  Buy this book.  You can transform yourself too.

B0009X766Y|5.0|For years I lamented the fact that there was no Widescreen DVD version of this movie available. Though released in 2005, I have only just now discovered this product (Xmas 2007). WOW!!    Seeing the movie for the first time in its natural aspect ratio was wonderful. You miss so much on cropped down \\"fit to your TV screen\\" versions. There is just so much going on around the scene that you loose the fine details that Director George Roy Hill injects into every shot.    The second disc contains bonus features that are absolutely wonderful. There is a featurette that includes interviews from several of the cast (in later years) which brings the full charm of this classic movie to light. I already knew I loved the story, but to listen to the cast talk about it, it becomes very clear that this was quite possibly - the perfect script ever written.    I am quite happy with this product and if you are a Sting fan - it should be in your collection.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|After bideding my time with the break up of creed i was hurled into a new world with the album \\"One Day Remains\\", to say the least it rocked my world to the foundations to hear something so fresh and unique, after seeing them 3 times i was emotional and yurning for the next masterpiece ablum, which brought me too \\"Black Bird\\" This album was phenominal, extra-ordinary well worth the 2 year wait, the mix was bliss and produced to a fine art.     Soaring beautiful vocal harmonys and lyrics, the song \\"Before Tomorrow Comes\\" grasped my every aspect of melody and musicianship... If there is to say one thing thats ever inspired me to love music, it would be this band and this album, I'll never hit the road without it being amongst my cd collection.  Thank you Alter Bridge
B00004SC3M|2.0|I'm sure men will enjoy this movie more than women, if for no other reason than they get to see Catherine Zeta Jones doing some intricate acrobats, meant to display her perfect body. But other than the fact that Jones and Connery are two very attractive people, who have great chemistry together (despite the age difference), Entrapment has very little to offer. It's a caper that ridiculously turns into a bad romantic comedy, and in the end it is as unsatisfactory as it is silly.
0875428940|5.0|The Robin Wood deck is the only one that has my soul's attention except for the Waite.  The pagan aspect totally missed me.  I do appreciate the artwork and the symbolism although I miss a few cards from the Waite deck.  The Magician should get his shirt on and I miss the symbols of the 4 fixed signs/Evangelists in the World.  There are a few off ones, but the court cards and many other are a real improvement.  There are so many \\"let's get stoned and make a deck\\" decks out there, I appreciate the \\"new improved\\" version with the deep numerological and archetypical stuff still intact.
0517548232|5.0|A great and accessible book on economics. If you know nothing about the topic, read it, because it will save you from the pitfalls that have brough on most of modern economic errors. If you know much about economics, read it, because it will correct many tipically wrong notions of economics in your head. It is not meant to be a tratise, nor to solve all problems. Like all great books, it is a simple, concise, yet essential single lesson in economics. From a broken window glass it takes you through all main aspects of modern economics and teaches you an essential lesson: think about the unseen effects of economic policies and actions. Get that lesson wrong and you will find yourself in the midst of a third world economics mentality (which of course you may want, depending on your political position in life).
B000X3KZVI|2.0|I went to the Adventures of Mimi Tour in NYC  @ Madsion square garden. I have always been a huge mariah fan since i was little so this was big for me. This was the 1st time I would be seeing her live and lets just say....i expected more.  1st off she came out an hour late. the opening act started at 7:00. Mariah wasnt out till like 9:30 !!  THATS TOO LONG.  LONGEST IVE EVER WAITED FOR A MAIN ACT AT A CONCERT.  she did all the hits , but never danced once. just stood there stiff. lol. then she mad a big issue about the lighting and  stoped in the middle of \\" Fly like a bird \\" and bitched and complained like the diva that she is. I love mariah to death but i dont know i just wanted it to more entertaining , more lively. I was bored to death. I feel like I wasted my money on my ticket and why the hell would i buy this dvd. in other words if you didnt go, you didnt miss much of anything.  Her tour was not worth it !!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Read my review for The Return of the King. If you are considering buying this movie for your collection, the extended version is well worth every penny and every additional minute in it.  Do not think twice about it. Get the Platinum Series. The cut footage makes the movies even better and with wide screen TVs galore who needs to go to the movies anymore?
B000WGZGNS|4.0|i didnt have the chance of seeing beyonce live .:( but i love her. have been a fan since destiny's child and i think she's even better solo. I saw a piece of the show on tv  so i decided to buy the dvd. This concert was the best.  she is one hell of a performer. Can't wait to see her live one day.
B00004YA66|4.0|Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel turned in a stellar performance as a Father and Son who talk over the radio 30 years apart to try and figure out the Nightingales killer, only to put themselves past and future in danger.  The complexity shows up when they start changing history and things don't necessarily line up correctly anymore, but if you suspend you critical thinking, the movie is still very enjoyable.  Great to watch, up to you if you want to own.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|Okay, so this movie is not going to win any awards; Owen and Giamatti do what they can with the characters, but this film is def about the 7-8 great shoot outs. You will see things you haven't seen before as far as action movies go; And for the most part I was entertained throughout. I kind of compare this movie to 'Crank' w/Jason Statham. Both are way over the top and totally unbelievable. But I was entertained, and there were several moments where I was caught up in all the glorious gunfire. Decently acted(Clive is always cool....)and energetic, 'Shoot 'Em Up' is great at what it does and sets out to do, hence the 4 star rating. You won't be hearing the phrase '...And the Oscar goes to...', but action fans should find something to enjoy.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|The one that i order last december came with the 7th disc (Alien Resurrection) defective. In both versions of the movie, theatrical and special edition, the movie stops in one specific scene (scene Nº 18 in theatrical version and Nº 21 in Special Edition) and jumps into the next one, it's like you were viewing a bad dvd copy.     I was so excited that i found this sci fi jewel for such a low price (21$). But not everything that shine is gold.
B000PA9Q6E|5.0|This CD is excellent.  Sometimes when additional material is released it is dissapointing and it is apparent why the artist did not release it in the first place.  NOT the case here!!!  Every and I mean every tune is excellent.  If you are a Johnny Winter fan you will love this CD.  Johnny is much more prominent on this CD then in the other live Waters/Winter releases.  This CD is produced by Bob Margolin (he also plays on the CD), Muddy's guitar player and a fine job he does here.  He also authors the liner notes paying tribute to the three legends.  Nice, another guitarist producing and recognizing Johnny late in his current career as Johnny did for Muddy.    If you want original Chicago Blues that smokes, buy this CD you will not be sorry.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|First there was Elvis, then The Beatles, then The Bee Gees, then R.E.M., then Matchbox 20, now, it's Sufan Stevens. The proceeding was a list of influential and great artists of their time, who did, are, and will leave an impact. To sum this album up, you'll either love it or hate it. To find out, I recommend hearing \\"Chicago\\", \\"Jacksonville\\", \\"Come On! Feel The Illinoise!\\". These are the highlights of the this unique great, classic album.<br /><br />The only track I hated? \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr.\\". That's right, a song about a serial killer. Strange? Listen to it. It's the most creepy song in the world. That said, how many people can make a song the elicits such emotions, to that degree? Sufan can.<br /><br />I personally love the album. You might hate it, or you might see the art, or the light in this case. Underrated? Sure. Different? Oh yeah. Art? Grammy worthy. Try it, buy it, love it, hate it, frame it, play it.
B000UGG3A0|4.0|Without going into a whole, winding, annoying history, i'd have to say that -while there have been a few fairly respectable songs along the way- this is the first album since Do Or Die that i'm not embarassed to be caught listening to. FINALLY, this band has grown up, and while that probably seems overly negative, i truly hope that they continue in this vein. Since the departure of frontman Mike McColgan (and nearly all other original members), this band has just taken a long time to gel. But, they seem to have done it, and the Springsteen references that have been thrown around with this release actually have a bit of creedence, believe it or not. There's some respectable storytelling here, and the energy level is high and consistent. It's punk, but grown up, and the \\"Irish factor\\" is present, but not so campy (see their past 3 releases), so you won't feel like a college douchebag while you you play this (save for the \\"johnny i hardly knew ye\\" track -groan).  Long story short: If you've wanted to like the Dropkick Murphys, but found it to be tough over the past 10 years, now is a pretty good time to check back in with em.

159102594X|3.0|The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie is the first book in the First Law trilogy. The second book being [[ASIN:1591026415 Before They Are Hanged (The First Law: Book Two)]] which is scheduled for release in the United States in late March, 2008. This novel represents Mr. Abercrombie's first novel. I originally came across this book based on a recommendation from a fellow fan of the fantasy genre. I looked into it and it sounded some what interesting, so I made the decision to go ahead and try it.<br /><br />The plot of this book, at least in my experience with the novel, was hard to discern. I was literally halfway through the novel before the actual plot of the novel began to emerge. This is mainly due to the fact that Mr. Abercrombie tried so hard to introduce new characters and set the stage for future scenes. Once I completed reading the novel, I believe the plot of this volume is merely a set up for the second and third books in the trilogy. There is a large political underpinning as well as a few personality conflicts. One aspect of the plot I found distracting was the sub-plot of the `Contest'. It is mentioned several times early in the book and centers around one character in particular. However, when taken into context of the overall story and concept, it seems misplaced and unwarranted. It really serves no real purpose and it was an aspect I could have cared less about. This seems to be a book that is large on characters and character development and flat on the actual story.<br /><br />The characters in this novel are, for the most part, interesting and diverse. Characters such as Logen, Glokta, Bayaz, and Ferro are all complex and interesting. They all have their unique voices and act in decidedly different manners. They all have their individual flaws and strength which is nice to see. However, there are several characters, such as Jezal that come across, at least to me, as really forced and almost as an added afterthought. Which seems odd, because the grittiness and realism involved in the first list of characters is so well done. Additionally, while I have read [[ASIN:055358894X The Lies of Locke Lamora]] by Scott Lynch and have seen, and read, cursing and swearing in a novel it almost seemed like a distraction in this novel. The majority of the character dialogue is well constructed and thoughtfully done. Yet, much like the characters, some of it seems contrived and involves too much `showing' to the reader.<br /><br />I understand that this is Mr. Abercrombie's first novel and as such there is some inherent growing pains associated with that. Here are a couple criticisms I have about this novel.<br /><br />First is the lack of a solid, central, plot line. As a reader, I should not be expected to expend copious amounts of energy trying to determine just what the book is about. There seemed to be little initial structure in regards to the plot and I think that hurts the overall enjoyment of this novel.<br /><br />Secondly, inconsistent characters. Mr. Abercrombie is very good at writing the gritty, tough, characters. However, when the character shifts to a less sure, more naïve character it becomes quite clear this is an area for improvement.<br /><br />Lastly, there are times when it is quite easy to breeze through fifty plus pages. However, there are times when this book becomes severely bogged down and almost seems like a chore to read. I believe this is a combination of the lack of plot and inconsistent characters.<br /><br />There are some positives with this novel.<br /><br />Mr. Abercrombie does show a knack for writing a solid tale. I think once he hones his craft and is able to correct some of this deficiencies he will truly be a name to watch in the fantasy genre.<br /><br />He ahs created a very good world. It's interesting, has variety, and flows well. I would have liked a map to be included to give reference points, but that is a minor thing in comparison.<br /><br />The majority of Mr. Abercrombie'sprose and pace is well done and held my interest. The few bumps that were present can easily be corrected with more practice.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent debut novel. While I do not hold it in high of praise as some others, I still think it's a solid novel. While I would hesitate to recommend this book to the casual fantasy fan. I think seasoned veterans of the fantasy genre would find many things to enjoy within the pages of this one. This is a very hard book for me to rate overall. In the end I will give it a 3 out of 5, because I truly believe Mr. Abercrombie can do better and has a bright future. I will surely check out the second book when it is published.nt can easily be corrected with more practice.    Overall, this is a decent debut novel.

B000XA5K48|4.0|Admittedly this isnt going to be for everyone. Rediculous over the top action scenes and more than enough \\"cheesey\\" lines.  That being said, if you don't mind that kind of stuff you're in for a hell of a cartoon of a movie.  There's even some wickedly funny (and sometimes even witty) humor.  Reminds me very much of those \\"Stick Figure Kung Fu\\" videos that were circling the web a few years back combined with classic Bugs Bunny.
0740748475|5.0|Even though I only paid a sale price of $67.50, I probably would be just as happily satisfied with this purchase had I paid the regular price. The quality of these books is impeccable. The binding feels strong, the paper is thick and glossy, and the border around each comic strip gives it a nice scrapbook feel. I also like how the originally published dates are written below each comic strip. The only problem I have now is having to sell my old individual Calvin and Hobbes books!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|My favorite movie of 2007!  This is a must-see. Absolutely simple, and that is what gives it such charm. Both \\"actors\\" are great even with no prior experience.  Best soundtrack of 2007 as well.
6300215717|5.0|This is one of those movies you'll watch and feel good about later. It is sweet and simple!
B000YPUF9W|4.0|I have not seen the movie, But of the previews that I have seen - It is a Winner!! If it is like the previous 2 movies, everyone should give it a chance - worth the rental or purchase.  Milla Jovovich once again delivers a great performance in her character.
6300215814|5.0|This is a great movie!!! If you haven't seen it, watch it! And soon!!! It is a wonderful classic!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've always adored Jane Austen, but I had my doubts when I found out Keira Knightley would play Elizabeth.  After seeing her in \\"action\\" type movies, ( like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" ) I thought it was impossible for her to pull it off.  I was so wrong!  Her acting is fabulous!!  The music is also beautiful and is mostly piano.  Although I know it's not as good as the BBC film, it's definitely a nicely condensed version of the story and I highly recommend this movie to Austen fans,
B000WGNLLW|5.0|Yes this is different from what Duran have done in the past. It's called GROWTH. Frankly, I think that Andy Taylor was the best thing that ever happened to Duran and this record Red Carpet Massacre is a breath of fresh air. The four that remain may they continue to rock and yes Virgina - grow and change for many more years to come. p.s. The extra DVD is so worth it.
006088732X|5.0|This book was excellent! The suspence was simply thrilling! I read it in 3 days. I just could not put it down. I recommend this book for teenagers  looking for a book that they can relate to - romance and comedy. Great book. Buy it now.
B0000019PA|4.0|It is completely 100% true that you either love this album or hate it. If you have any qualms about this one, listen to the title track or Holland, 1945. You'll (hopefully) be glad you did.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Spoiler alert---starts with sam spinning hub cap, it flies away! Then he is in a tree, then going across window, cleaning house, then jack in the box, on mailbox, imitating horror movie, charlie chaplan biscuit routine, knowing every line in horror movie, ballon squeel with strings, balloon breaks, swinging by at movies end on rope in slow mo, at park doing buster keaton with hat and flips, classic
B000VNMMQG|5.0|After watching the film \\"Amazing Grace\\" the other night, I had to immediately watch it again, so impressive was the remarkable attention to historical detail and authenticity. It was easy to smell the lush English countryside, the dim old churches, and the stench of the slave ships. It plunges the viewer into late eighteenth, early nineteenth century England.    I must admit, however, that I was a bit confused by the portrayal of the Duke of Clarence, the future William IV, as an unappealing midget. Did the prince, whom I have always thought of as a very handsome man, really spend that much time lounging around the House of Commons? I thought Clarence was usually to be found with the navy, or with Mrs. Jordan and their ten children. But then I do not really know that much about him.    The story pivots around the first encounter of politician William Wilberforce with the lovely, idealistic young lady who was to become his wife. Barbara encouraged Wilberforce to persevere in his struggle to outlaw the slave trade in the British Empire, in spite of his many health problems. The wealthy merchants and their representatives in parliament stood against him. It is interesting that in autocratic France, slavery had long been abolished; a former slave, the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, held an exalted post at the court of Versailles.    Wilberforce, a devout Christian, gained popular support for the cause through education, boycotts, and skillful political maneuvering. His character, portrayed by Ioann Grufudd as an eccentric English country gentleman, in love with God, is utterly captivating. His courage and refusal to surrender his convictions, in spite of slander and ridicule, made him a prince among men, one who was totally free.
B000089RV6|2.0|AC/DC are one of the greatest Bands that have ever been. No Question. I consider two of their Albums as absolute classics but Black In Black is not one of them. This re-birth of AC/DC was not the same. The Genius of their music had died in the back seat of a car.<br /><br />What is missing from Brian Johnson's song writing and vocal prowess is the intelligence, wit, insightfulness, humour and clarity that Bon Scott so effortlessly brought to his songs.<br /><br />When Bon sang I could understand every word, every nuance and he had a story to tell. With Johnson on the other hand, I find that I can't understand a single word. All I hear is Honky Tonk this or Honky Tonk that.<br /><br />That said Black In Black is the best of the Johnson Albums. It has two classic rock tracks; the title number and `You Shook Me...' yet still these pale in comparison to anything penned on `Highway...' or `Dirty Deeds...'<br /><br />I have tried so hard to love AC/DC with Johnson at the microphone but as time has gone on, I always return to the original version of the band and their far superior recordings.  When Bon sings I instantly understand why AC/DC rocks me so deeply and I still miss his musical Genius.
0307341550|2.0|This first novel from Gillian Flynn, seems, in my opinion, to be reviewed mainly for it's \\"shock effect\\" and not for the actual strength of the writing style, plot, and characters. My choices of reading tend to be on the more literary side - novels that have won awards and are critically acclaimed. And, after reading some of the customer reviews, I decided to try it, regardless of the somewhat mixed nature of the ratings.     Taking all this into consideration, I really felt like this was a waste of my time. While, yes, there was interesting commentary on human nature and the psychological effects of emotional and physical abuse, the actual believability of the characters left much to be desired. They are uneven, and I seemed to often think as I was reading the novel that a comment or an action seemed out of character for the person being described. In other words, it didn't flow.     The reason that I may be judging this book so harshly is that I tend to gravitate towards \\"disturbing\\" or \\"weird\\" subjects. I've read many books with graphic violence in them, so maybe the shock value was lost on me. I am absolutely astounded to learn that this was nominated for an Edgar award for best first novel. It seemed like an amateur attempt at a who-dun-it shock mystery. I guessed at the \\"shock\\" ending, which was hastily thrown in at the end, and seemed to be completely without purpose. Story lines ended abruptly. The entire plot, while taking place at one location, switches hurriedly, without explanation, and seemingly just to facilitate a \\"shock ending\\". It lacked coherence in respect to the character development and pace.     If you're looking for a well written who-dun-it type of contemporary novel, I would recommend \\"Back Roads\\" by Tawni O'Dell. It's in the same vein as \\"Sharp Objects\\" (takes place in a small town, analyzes the psychological effect parents can have on children, contains a \\"twist\\"). It's a psychological thriller that I simply could not get out of my mind after reading. I had to read it a second time in a college course and found that it was just as shocking the second time around. It's \\"surprise\\" ending is incredible, shocking, and, most importantly, necessary to the story. And, it was MUCH more deserving of a nomination celebrating a best first novel... \\"Sharp Objects\\" doesn't even come close.
B000VWYNNW|2.0|The edits are simply TERRIBLE. There is no excuse to put a dvd soundtrack (with edits made for video) on cd. The bonus tracks are nice, but why is Black Dog incomplete? Why is there a chunk missing from Whole Lotta Love? The answer is: because these songs were not complete in the movie due to a lack of film footage. How idiotic!  The songs on the original album release were edited with the MUSIC in mind. They were more complete and better presented. For example, the improvisation section in No Quarter is beautiful and flows perfectly, but not on THIS release!  My final gripe is the fact that the producer has added studio effects to the music presumably to make it more modern sounding. The most ghastly of these is the addition of a \\"chorus\\" effect on the guitar in Stairway to Heaven. This effect did not exist in 1973! The only time I can remember Jimmy Page using a chorus effect on Stairway to Heaven was at Live Aid in 1985! 'Nuff said! I can't believe that Jimmy Page was involved with this release. If he had been, I am sure we would all be celebrating a 5 star release!
B000YENUI6|5.0|Yeah, I know \\"breathtaking\\" is a bit of a clich&eacute; but Eastern Promises is the type of film that you can't stop watching once it begins to play. It's also a must see for anyone interested in the Russian mob. Here the concentration is on the London version of the mafiya although the vors have their tentacles stretched into numerous other cities and countries. Viggo Mortensen is exceptional as Nikolai who is only \\"a driver\\" in the laconic language of the mob. He is quite a bit more! The plot is very intricate but I will not give any of it away here. Suffice to say, however, that you will be extremely surprised by its ending. Steven Knight wrote this along \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" which was riveting as well. The power of the 2002 release gave me an inkling that Eastern Promises would be as absorbing as it turned out to be.
0060763280|3.0|I believe the Secrets of The Millionaire Mind is a great Book for anyone who has some financial discontent, is open minded, and uses discretion in what they read.    It pointed out to me where I maybe limiting my potential new worth with beliefs and habits that might not be working. The author has great suggestions for new habits that supposedly work for those who have achieved financial success and are reasonably content with it.    I also recommend \\"The Prosperity Paradigm\\" by Steve D'Annunzio. Like this book, Steve's book can help you achieve greater net worth and also achieving a greater sense of self worth - both go hand in hand .
B00011F5DK|5.0|What a great and simple to learn game but NOT boring.  Ages 42 down to 4 (the ages in my family) all enjoy it and I like that it doesn't take a long time and doesn't require a lot of thinking.  What I mean is that if I really wanted to win, of course I'd do so but I like that when I'm tired, the kids are bugging me to play with them - well, I can sorta of go through the motions and let them win.  And really, who the heck really wants to try and beat 4 & 6 year olds?    But, I could also see this being a fun adult game when I had time to really focus on winning.      Try it - simple to learn, engaging - even for little kids.
1741751772|4.0|The Shifting Fog was a recommendation on my Amazon list.  I read the description of the book (per the audio edition) and knew I had to have it.  Unfortunately, it was no longer available through Amazon so I had to go to an auction site and actually bought it from a bookstore in another country!  If you liked Upstairs, Downstairs or period drama from WWI and the 1920s you definitely have to read this book!    Grace is born 1n 1900 and gets a position as parlormaid at Riverton Manor when she is 14 (her mother had also worked at Riverton Manor).  Over time, Grace becomes interested in the lives of the two teenage sisters who reside at Riverton during the summers (their father is \\"second in line\\" so Riverton is not their home).    The story continues through WWI and the affect that has on both \\"upstairs\\" residents and \\"downstairs\\" residents, and afterward until an evening in 1924 when a friend of the family, Robbie Hunter (who is also a depressed poet) commits suicide at a lake on the Riverton estate, in front of both Hannah and Emmeline (the sisters).  After that night the sisters never speak again.    The story is narrated by Grace via flashbacks from 1999 when a film producer shows up at the nursing home where Grace now lives.  Ursula the film producer is making a film about the events surrounding the suicide of Robbie Hunter and has tracked down Grace for her first hand account.    Aside from the era being very well drawn, the characters of Grace, Hannah, Emmeline, and the supporting cast are very rich and you can definitely lose yourself in this book.  If you have seen Upstairs Downstairs you will recognize a lot of the descriptions of the duties and relationships of both the family and their servants - including their secrets.  It is a wonderful book to curl up with.    I highly recommend it (if you can find it!).

B000Y44LBG|4.0|American Gangster is based on the true story of Frank Lucas's whirlwind success selling heroin in New York. In 1968 every news station reported that more and more people were beginning to experiment with this relatively new drug from Southeast Asia. It took just one man to put 2 and 2 together and take a quick trip to Vietnam before he was selling heroin that was twice as pure for half as much. And life was very good, but when life is too good people notice.     I enjoyed the calm and collected manner in which Frank Lucas carried himself at almost all times. It is hard not to respect what he was able to do, despite the lives he ruined. I thought Denzel Washington did a good job as Lucas for most of the movie. Unfortunately for me, and I am not generally a Denzel fan, towards the end he started to pick up the flagrant arrogance and short temper that won him an Oscar in Training Day.     I liked American Gangster, but I didn't love it. I don't like Denzel, but he was better than usual. I don't like Russell Crowe...and he wasn't any better than usual. Frank Lucas was an interesting man who tried to do things the right way, if there is a \\"right way\\" to grow your drug empire. I liked the movie because of the man it was about, not the execution. The movie was a little too long and focused on some strange things that were arguably unnecessary to the story. I feel like it could have been trimmed down and been a little better for it.     I'd give it a 3.5 if I were able.
B000TXG3YA|4.0|This record delivers.  It reminds me of a more basic, bluesier version of the earlier Mastodon stuff.  Not as technical, but nicely layered.  Lots of the same arpeggiated guitar intros, plenty of instrumentals, ambient interludes.  Vox sound kind of like Hot Water Music or Fugazi with a metal edge.  If you're into the more rock-oriented stuff on Relapse, this record won't disappoint.
0446401307|4.0|Harry Bosch finds himself in the midst of a murder mystery that may link to terrorist intent on using radioactive material for a huge attack on LA, and as usual Bosch follows his gut to the answer and fights through the recurrent obstacles within his department and the FBI.  For a while it seems that Connelly is moving into Vince Flynn territory with terrorists and the potential for catastrophe. Connelly maintains the suspense and thrill characteristic of the Bosch novels.  The format for this novel's writing definitely effects its flow and length along with the plot.  I think he tried to throw in a little of everything in a tighter than usual space.  The story appears to jump from one conclusion to the next in rapid pace that forfeits a more steady and developing plot I have come to expect.  This book is about 150-200 pages shorter in length than his other novels. The story delivers--just not as much as I am used to.
0307341542|3.0|I just finished this novel and while it was enjoyable, it was also slightly predictable. I figured out who the killer was by the middle of the book. What made the novel fun was the characters and their evolution. I really enjoyed their quirkiness and the understanding that all people have secrets, and in small towns, rumor spreads fast and nothing is sacred. Flynn approaches the characters and their actions without regret or apology for the situations they find themselves in. Overall, I recommend this as an easy weekend or vacation read; nothing to serious, but not completely mindless either.
B00004SZWB|5.0|The reason I wrote for this review is to bring the average rating star to the max. \\"Hotter Than July\\" (1980) is a masterpiece. After about three decades since it was first released, the album can still enthrall and excite new audience.    As many have mentioned, all songs create a complete and eclectic album experience that even Stevie could not (or did not intend to) repeat since. It doesn't sound as synthesized as 80s soul nor orchestrated as 70s funk tracks. It stands in between and that's why it's special.    We all knew \\"Lately\\" (heartfelt ballad) and \\"Happy Birthday\\" (uplifting ode to Martin Luther King) or to some extend \\"Master Blaster\\" (Stevie in his 'riddem' mode). They are beyond great. However, the lesser known songs, such as \\"Did I Hear You Say You Love Me\\", \\"All I Do\\" and \\"Rocket Love\\" are golden nuggets from a treasure chest. Treat the record as a 'concept' album if you will, Stevie sculpted these tunes to be enjoyed on a hot sunny day (look at his image on the cover).     The remastered version is the one to get. It retains its deep acoustic, spacey sound. The only drawback after absorbing yourself to \\"Hotter Than July\\" is that there are no other albums that sound quite like it.
B00005JPTI|3.0|I had watched the earlier version of this movie, The Omega Man, on late night T.V., when I was a kid and I was totally spooked by it, the beginning was so creepy, with Heston all alone in Downtown L.A. and as he loses track of time and we see the sun fade into the sunset we are not sure why he is in a panic; it was really cool cinema.  Most people now look at that film as 70's camp, but frankly I liked it for what it was, which is why i looked forward to this film, I liked the idea of Will Smith taking the role and the move to NYC as the location.  The first half of the movie rocked, id give it five stars, but the second half and the fact that the CGI vampires didnt work at all, forced an overall three star rating.  Smith is very good in this, frankly I think he is way better by himself than when bouncing off of other actors, I think this is his best role since Ali, if only the CGI team had been up to his level.  Overall, good film, could have been great, but still worth a viewing.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I read an interview with Thom Yorke in NME where he explains that \\"In Rainbows\\" is Radiohead's best work, in essence it's the bands equivalent to the Beatles \\"Revolver\\", which is hailed by many as not only the Beatles best album, but probably the best rock album of all time. After listening to \\"In Rainbows\\" extensively over the last 2 months, I would have to agree with him. With \\"In Rainbows\\", Radiohead have produced a beautiful, mature, thoughtful piece of music. \\"In Rainbows\\" is a masterpiece, a groundbreaking achievement. An instant classic.    The magic here is how well crafted and beautiful these songs are. The care taken by the band and Nigel Godrich in the writing and production have created a soundscape that is remarkable and mezmerizing in it's effect. The sound is spacious, open and big. Beautiful soft guitar lines and strings meander throughout, coupled with melodies that are instantly some of the best that the band has ever written. 10 perfect pop songs that don't sound pop. Radiohead has never sounded more confident and yet vulnerable at the same time. Put on headphones, close your eyes and just listen. \\"In Rainbows\\" is a truly beautiful noise.
0143038419|5.0|I didn't expect to like this book, given how popular it has become with mainstream readers.  I thought that it would be \\"fluffy\\" and would commercialize a spiritual journey so as to make it cheap.  However, I found that was not the case.  While Gilbert does have (and use) a wonderful sense of humor, she never seems to loose her sense of the sacred.  While I didn't love the \\"Hollywood ending\\", I found this to be a very satisfying, illuminating and joyful journey.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I along with most of the Stargate fans out there think this show should have never been canceled.  I watched this series from the beginning start out small and eventually grow to have a cult following that can almost go head to head with any Trek fan.  I have not seen the full length movie yet only clips that have become available since the series ended; however the storyline is supposed to answer questions that were left opened when the series ended.  I hope everyone out there who is a Stargate fan will purchase this movie and leave reviews to show MGM and Sci-Fi that the Gates brand deserves another chance and ECW does not belong on the Sci-Fi channel.  I know there is still Stargate Atlantis and I am a HUGE fan of that show, but it still will never be the same as SG-1.  Enjoy everyone.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Absolutely one of the best box sets I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  The new Final Cut looks fantastic, and the special features are AMAZING.  There's so much stuff on here, including the 3 1/2 hour long Dangerous Day \\"making of\\" documentary and I just discovered another 2+ hour one on Philip K. Dick.  This is the absolute ultimate for any Blade Runner fan.
037571457X|5.0|I was assigned this book in one of my college classes and i just enjoyed reading it. I really got into it that i decided to purchase the second one. I would recommend this to anyone.
B000K7VHJQ|3.0|A couple of thoughts:     First of all, the fact that the movie was in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew drove me crazy. I really dislike subtitles, I (personally anyway) find them distracting and they tend to force me away from paying attention to other parts of a film that I like to look at.     There was no story-telling at all. Now granted, since it made money hand-over-fist, this may be a moot-point in a lot of ways. However, if you were coming from a family that wasn't particularly religious, I couldn't help but think that you'd have no idea who the characters were or what was going on.     I had heard people mention that they had thought that `Braveheart' was a warm-up for what Gibson did on TPOTC. I disagree with that on every possible level. `Braveheart' was a better film, and not by a small margin.     I had also heard mentioning of \\"The Media's\\" over-hyping the violence in the film. I didn't think this was at all overstated. If anything, it was more violent then I expected. Now, being such a fan of horror, action, and science-fiction movies, I'm the LAST person in the world to complain about a movie being violent or bloody. I do think though, that it hit a point where the brutality in the movie ceased to have a point in forwarding the story. It almost seemed to be violent, just for the hell of it. Yeah, I know, and then I get to hear the argument \\"Well, that was what he really went through.\\" Well there's a difference between conveying the point that he was tortured and seeing every minute of Christ BEING tortured. I felt (in several instances) that Gibson had made his point and just continued to, visually, beat-up his audience. With a running time of over two hours, you probably very easily could have trimmed about five or ten minutes off and given your audience a little bit more of a mental break.  Although admittedly, is edition of the film does make some of these scenes a little easier ...    Monica Bellucci is an OUTSTANDING Italian actress that's given virtually nothing to do.     I LOVED the scenes with Mary reflecting back on her life with Christ as a child and a young man, but there aren't NEARLY enough of them. For me, they were the only points where I felt emotionally invested in the movie. Other then that I felt like I was watching a one-legged man in an a$$-kicking contest.     I honestly didn't see where the film was anti-Semitic. I thought it was clear that the Jewish hierarchy simply felt that its authority was being usurped and that it was the actions of several individuals in power that started \\"the conspiracy against Christ\\" (for lack of a better term) and not an indictment of the ENTIRE Jewish faith.  To be fair though, I'm not Jewish.  I might very well feel completely different if my upbringing was that of another faith.    As far as being a \\"traditionalist\\" movie, I didn't think there was enough script to make a judgment. It didn't appear to shoot off in any bizarre directions, and I never found myself saying \\"Hey ... that didn't happen like that.\\" What exactly would a \\"non-traditionalist\\" film look like?       So on the whole maybe two and a half or three stars out of five. It will certainly give people something to talk about (which in of itself probably isn't such a bad thing) but I didn't find myself the least bit moved or fulfilled on a religious level.

B00005JPKE|5.0|I was very pleased with this movie. After wading through \\"Flags\\", it took me a couple months to regain enough interest in another Eastwood movie on the same subject. I am sorry that I waited so long.    As someone who has read a great deal about WWII, I am amazed at some of the reviews. Yes, Marines did shoot prisoners, wounded Japanese (21,000 soldiers do not die instantly on the battle field) and even corpses they happened upon. This was not the norm, but this battle and that of Okinawa, were in a class of their own given their ferocity, scale, suicidal fanaticism and kill or be killed nature.     It would have been nice had they been able to film the movie on site, but given the nature of Iwo today (one large cemetery), it is understandable why they could not.    This is a $19MM film that told a story of a handful of soldiers with the battle of Iwo Jima as a back drop. It was not meant to portray the fullness of the actual battle and the tens of thousands of people who suffered over 35 days of savage combat. It is not \\"anti-American\\" nor does it portray the Japanese as saints. It is refreshing to see a movie made from the perspective of the other side. For some reason, we see our history and battles as black and white; all good vs evil. While World War II was certainly in most all aspects a \\"black and white\\" conflict (few sane people would ever try to defend Nazi ideology or Japanese militarism), it is interesting that most all of the people we were fighting in fierce combat were our sworn allies in a matter of months after the war. What drove such behavior and why? What did we/they learn? How do we avoid the rise of such ruinous systems in the future (sadly, these questions are not being asked often enough in Japan as they have been in Germany)? It is unfortunate that this film was seen by so few in a country that lost so many to liberate the very people we now protect.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|Manu Chao is simply genius!!!  He is much like a hidden gem in the US but in the vast majority of the world he is an idol.  His music, incredibly refreshing, hits the heart. If you have the fortune of being multilingual, you know what I'm saying. Even a martian with no language would enjoy his music.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|I was a huge fan of Hot Fuss, turned off by Sam's Town, but was excited about this album.  There are some killer tunes here (no pun intended) but sometimes, I wish the production was better.  At times, it felt like the melodies within the songs didn't flow together and it could've been so much better.  I was often floored by the melody of the song (\\"Glamourous Indie Rock n Roll\\") but wished the lyrics/topic would've been different.  The potential for perfection of these songs is huge, but it leaves me wanting to make a few changes here and there.  My favorites include:  Tranquilize (different but strangely catchy)  Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf (couldn't stop listening to this song for days- best of the album, one of my fav. B-sides of all time)  Sweet Talk (could've been a single)  Glamourous Indie Rock and Roll (could've been such a classic if the topic was worthy)  The Ballad of Michael Valentine (could use more tweaking)  Daddy's Eyes (good stuff)  Mr. Brightside (the intro to this re-mix is spine-tingling but it does go on too long)    Bottom line- I love this cd...but with a little more fine-tuning, it could've been up there with the best of U2 or Coldplay...too many \\"could've\\"s.
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein, a Canadian journalist, has followed No Logo with this useful book on key aspects of capitalism today.<br /><br />Capital sees disasters - acts of terrorism, hurricanes in Central America and New Orleans, the tsunami in South Asia - as market opportunities for `for-profit' relief and reconstruction. Since 2003, terrorist attacks have multiplied sevenfold, but Wall Street now soars with each new attack, and the US `security industry' is worth $200 billion.<br /><br />Yet the relief and rebuilding are just covers for profit-making: capital creates free-fire economic zones marked by privatisation and pillage. Even the military is privatised, promising limitless war: in Iraq the US and British governments are hiring more mercenaries than soldiers.<br /><br />Klein draws an analogy between the `shock doctrine' of the CIA's torture techniques aimed at remaking human minds and Milton Friedman's free market economics forced on Chile in 1973 and on Bolivia, Argentina and Britain in the 1980s. Thatcher launched her counter-revolution, crashing the economy, on the back of the triumphalist Falklands war.<br /><br />Klein describes Yeltsin's 1993 coup when his forces killed 500 people in Moscow, burnt the parliament (Yeltsin's own Reichstag fire) and imprisoned the opposition. Clinton and the EU's leaders vigorously supported it all. Yeltsin then enforced the free market, since when Russia's population has fallen by 6.6 million. Between 1989 and 1997 the number of poor people rose from 2 million to 74 million.<br /><br />In the 1990s, Poland too got the shock treatment, and now has 40% youth unemployment. 59% live below the poverty line, compared to 15% in 1989.<br /><br />In South Africa, `Just call me a Thatcherite' Thabo Mbeki was in charge of the economic negotiations when the ANC let apartheid's rulers keep control of the economy. The ANC adopted Friedman's policy of central bank `independence', which means independent from democratic control, responsible only to finance capital. This key policy is in South Africa's Constitution, as is the protection of private property, exactly as in the EU's Constitution. Both Constitutions make the rule of capital into legal duties. The ANC also accepted the World Trade Organisation's rule that it is illegal to subsidise industries and accepted `wage restraint', the International Monetary Fund condition for loans.<br /><br />Who gains? South Africa's whites still own 70% of the land and four giant firms own and control the banks, mines, industries and 80% of the Stock Exchange. Who loses?

B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|I just watched this last night and have read many of the reviews of this transfer being too dark due to Coppola's desire to give the film his original intended look. Is it very dark? Yes, it is. It's clearly noticeable. However, my wife and I actually liked it. We thought it lent a darker, more eerie, aspect to the film. The quality of the film is great though and is certainly hi-def quality. Most scenes are sharp and clear and we'd actually noticed things we hadn't before and we've each seen the film plenty of times. Die hard fans of the film will likely be upset by the change and I can understand that especially when you are so familiar with the films look. When viewing the movie you can easily see how dark it is especially in the blacks. Black are VERY black, basically matte black (ie. flat black with no detail). The movie looks kinda like up'ing the contrast and lowering the brightness. Outside of that though we enjoyed the picture quality and the surround sound was used phenomenally. Overall, if you're a die hard fan you may want to rent it before buying as it will come down to personal preference. The sharpness and clarity of hi-def are clearly there, but the movie is darker and the color of some scenes have changed dramatically. We thought it was well done and worth the purchase.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I read a lot of poor reviews complaining that the music was too different and ruined the dvd set. I do not agree.

B000F1IQN2|3.0|I enjoy thriller/action movies and Munich looked like it would be an interesting one. In some ways, it was much better than a typical action movie, and in other ways worse.    At the very outset, a Palestinian terrorist group kidnapped and killed 11 Israeli Olympians as the Olympics were beginning in Munich. The movie then tells of Israel hiring special agents and their efforts to hunt down Palestinians in vengeance.     The unfortunate thing about Munich is how graphic and violent it is. With the story of assasins and Israeli/Palestinian conflict, violence is not surprising, but in my opinion, they could have filmed just as effective a movie without as much detail. For this reason, I would have to strongly caution people who do not like graphic films. On the other hand, it does not trivialize death. And it also tries to show how traumatic and haunting these events are, even months later, to \\"hardened\\" men like assassins.    The wonderful and amazing thing about Munich is how philosophical it is. Unlike many thriller movies that have a good guy and bad guys and thus a black and white conflict, this film shows the complexity of human thought and motivation and the complexity of conflict. The characters are shown as family men, working men, men who care about relationships and life, men who find their new assignment distasteful though necessary.    The conflict is highly complex. Various characters throughout the movie question what they're doing and why they're doing it. Is it right to be assassinating these chosen men without proof of their involvement in Munich? Is it right to trust their employer? They've been told to kill only the specified Palestinians, but what happens when their own teammate is murdered? Is it okay to then kill that colleague's murderer? What does it mean to be a Jew? Does it mean only that one is loyal to Israel? Or does it mean that one is righteous before God, obeying the Law more than the government?    Usually the end of a movie has definition and resolution, but Munich does not. The lead character is less sure of himself and his work than ever before in the movie. Through the course of his assignment, he had gradually become callous and vengeful. But as he saw violence only beget more violence, he questioned Israel's methods and his own loyalty to them. We are left with questions and doubts rather than a feeling of success or determination. This is a refreshing, more accurate portrayal of a world that is indeed not black and white.
B000002GW5|3.0|First things first: \\"Running On Empty\\" and \\"The Load-Out / Stay\\" are probably deserving of their ubiquity on classic-rock radio. They're the closest this record comes to the standards Browne set on his earliest albums.    The rest of Running On Empty is slight, and goes down easy, and that's both a good thing and a bad one. With its well-known bookends and its easy-to-comprehend thematic threads, it's a great record to recommend to a Jackson Browne novice. After all, everything - the melodies, the singing, the playing - is solid. It's a completely accessible record. If you like it, you'll probably check out more of his work, and you'll either find yourself stunned by the considerably greater depth of some of it, or put off by the fact that those other records deal with grey areas rather than black and white.    (I started off in the latter camp. Running On Empty was the first Jackson Browne album I ever heard, back when I was fourteen or so. I listened to it constantly, and really liked it, but it took me a long, long time to get into any of his other music. Isolated songs from Saturate Before Using and Late For the Sky made some impact, but I might've been too young to understand how truly adult those records were. Running On Empty, however, never confused me one bit.)    Running On Empty was recorded on the road - at concerts, on buses, in hotel rooms - and captures that ambience well. The snatches of dialogue, the intimacy of \\"Cocaine\\" and the first half of \\"The Road,\\" and most of all the shouted requests for familiar older tunes that precede the title track all speak to the weariness, the repetitiveness of being constantly in motion. But Neil Young beat him to the punch several years earlier with Time Fades Away, a frustrating, messy record that nevertheless runs rings around Running On Empty precisely because it's uncomfortable and requires that it be listened to with an open mind. Running On Empty, on the other hand, requires ears and nothing more.    Some critics have pointed to the songwriting credits on Running On Empty as evidence that Browne was living the title phrase to the extreme - only the title track and \\"You Love the Thunder\\" are solo efforts, and four of the songs don't bear Browne's name at all. This is often seen as laziness or exhaustion rearing its head, but it may have simply been a natural collaborative outgrowth of being on tour. Who knows. Even giving Browne the benefit of the doubt and chalking up his less-than-impressive compositional record on Running On Empty to a desire to work well with others, it's pretty hard to ignore the fact that most of these songs are simply not that great. Comfortable, catchy, and even mostly memorable, perhaps, but just not up to Browne's earlier standard.    Naturally, Running On Empty became Browne's biggest success, closing one chapter of his career and starting a new, less thrilling one through which he could simply coast, rather than have to navigate.
B000957O7S|4.0|If you need a good laugh at the end of a hard week, this is the film for you! Hitch is a remarkable combination of humor and sensitivity, enjoyable for both men and women. I have never seen my husband laugh harder than in this movie!    Alex Hitchins is a private, secretive consultant who helps timid or awkward men find the courage and grace to meet and court the women they've been longing to know. Hitch is challenged when an accountant hires him in order to get to know a millionaire celebrity. But it turns out that Hitch's biggest challenge is letting down his own barriers when he himself falls in love.    There are many moments of male/female humor in Hitch, poking fun at the different ways we communicate and understand. There is also good old slapstick and laughing at our own human foibles and weaknesses. Thankfully the humor is clean, even though the movie has its share of sexual innuendo and God's name misused. If you're sensitive about innuendo and language, this movie might bother you a bit. But I was really impressed by the emphasis on honorable, respectful behavior in Hitch.    For example, the mission of Alex Hitchins is expressly not sexual. When one potential client admits that he just wants to \\"bang\\" the girl he likes, Hitch goes through the roof. His job is to help people have the time to talk and listen to each other, growing in passion because of common interests. He has no sympathy for sleazy men who only want their own \\"needs\\" met. He refuses to work with this customer.     Also there are moments when Alex himself could have compromised his ideals for his own gratification, but instead pursued friendship. Throughout the story, he is shown to be mature and concerned about who women really are.     Hitch is not just a fairy tale movie. Hitch discovers the difficulty that past betrayal causes in present relationships. He is confronted with the choice between loving and risking, and staying \\"safe\\" but never loving. Friends of his are willing to speak candidly with him, challenging his assumptions about love and life.     I highly recommend this movie as one of my top romantic comedies, finding the innuendoes and language the only major drawbacks.

B000Q6ZG6G|5.0|Not to suggest that you can expect to see Kubrick's last film in a stunning new light on Blu-Ray, and although like any Blu-Ray it is certainly beautiful, by comparison to some other Blu-Rays, it is not an exceptional transfer.  I've had a Hitachi 1080i plasma on my wall for about a year now and I finally got a Playstation 3 so I can buy and enjoy Blu-Rays.  Unlike the switch from video to DVD, the upgrade to Blu-Ray doesn't necessarily mean I will have to start my movie collection all over again as I can play all of my DVDs as well, but I was prompted to buy Eyes Wide Shut (a DVD I do own) when I realized it was the unrated version only previously available in Europe.  I thought that might mean it would be closer to what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but the additional footage is really just some extra sexual content.  I should clarify that it isn't really extra footage at all, it's just that a bunch of robed figures blocking our view from some naughty behavior in the [[ASIN:B00005ATQD American release]] were actually removed in this version so you can see the naughty behavior.  I didn't even realize the figures were there and now I have to get my arms around the reasons why they were included to begin with.  I don't know, perhaps if Mike Huckabee becomes president those mysterious robed figures will make a dramatic comeback.  That might verify my suspicions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'm not convinced this is what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but contemplating what he did intend is fascinating to me.  I actually consider Kubrick among my favorite directors, so this fascination is probably not as applicable to non-fans. Of his films, Eyes Wide Shut is, along with [[ASIN:B000UJ48SQ Barry Lyndon]], his least appreciated and most criticized, although not by me.  Eyes Wide Shut is actually one of my favorite Kubrick films.  Even though it is not as cohesive as his others; it is, on the surface at least, among his most stylized.  The interactions characters have are slow and deliberate and it gives the meaning behind each word and each frame more clarification.  Many call this quality dreamlike and it is.  Expressing reality doesn't seem to be a priority in Eyes Wide Shut and I wonder if the film was ever meant to be reality in the first place. Although the film is dreamlike per se, there is nothing at all to indicate that any of it was a dream.  In fact, the presence of the cult mask on Alice and Bill's bed verifies the exact opposite.  Still, I for one believe the style is absolutely intentional and that is supported by the meticulous photography in the film.  Almost every shot seems like it was mulled over again and again.  It is no wonder Kubrick had the reputation for doing almost a hundred takes.  He was a perfectionist and, at least visually, Eyes Wide Shut has more moments of perfection than not.  The acting is good too but really, the control Kubrick has is so evident that it is hard to credit the actors.  However, Nicole Kidman is particularly strong.<br /><br />With all that said, Eyes Wide Shut may seem otherworldly, but its psychological commentary on marital fidelity from the male perspective is very real.  Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is told by his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) that she had at one time thought about having an affair.  The paranoia, possibilities, and the trials he endures psychologically and in terms of his fidelity to her, are tested as he walks around New York City and guides us through his many surreal and outwardly sexual encounters.  It is an exhibition of his gradual psychological breakdown after his wife shared her secret and all of his encounters seem to be taunting him in his fragile state.  There's more than enough here to make it a great film and to connect almost all of the dots, however, some interesting conspiracy theories exist about the orgy cult that becomes the center of the film's climax.  I'd recommend checking those out if you like this movie but I'm not going to reveal my opinion of them one way or the other.<br /><br />With all of that said, I thought the characters themselves are normal and well-adjusted, so the commentary itself is even more significant.  They are actually good people in a film about doing what is all too often perceived as bad things (i.e. sex).  I'm sure there are good reasons not to like Eyes Wide Shut, but for the most part I thought it was unfairly reviewed because of the sexual content and the sexual commentary.  We are so used to seeing nudity strictly used gratuitously, that it was easy to be cynical of its consistent use here, and that is just the visual sexual elements never mind what the film's deeper intentions are overall.  I'm not surprised I guess because if the film has a flaw, it is that it's too cryptic at times.  Either way, I think it's a great movie and it's nice to see this version released on the best technology we have.opinion of them one way or the other.      With all of that said, I thought the characters themselves are normal and well-adjusted, so the commentary itself is even more significant.  They are actually good people in a film about doing what is all too often perceived as bad things (i.e. sex).  I'm sure there are good reasons not to like Eyes Wide Shut, but for the most part I thought it was unfairly reviewed because of the sexual content and the sexual commentary.  We are so used to seeing nudity strictly used gratuitously, that it was easy to be cynical of its consistent use here, and that is just the visual sexual elements never mind what the film's deeper intentions are overall.  I'm not surprised I guess because if the film has a flaw, it is that it's too cryptic at times.  Either way, I think it's a great movie and it's nice to see this version released on the best technology we have.
B000W1V5VU|2.0|Everybody loves Ocean's senior member, Reuben, so when Vegas  Willy Banks cheats him out of their casino partnership and causes Reuben to have a heart attack, the Ocean's team get back togetehr for revenge.    This should be great.  They've got another big stakes heist on a Vegas casino. Oh, and the dastardly Terry Benedict from \\"Eleven\\" has even joined the team because he wants to break the \\"Banks\\" as much as the Ocean's team does.     So, why didn't it work?  Too much detail and too much setup.  You're wiped out by the time the real action happens and while you want to see poor old Reuben get his own back--it just doesn't seem quite worth it at the end.      I'm glad I only rented this film and didn't see it at the theatre.  I'd strongly suggest anyone who hasn't seen it and wants to rent \\"Thirteen\\" before buying it.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The soundtrack has a soft, indie feel with a few rambunctious songs thrown on there, complimenting the satisfying \\"not what you expected\\" feel of the movie. Kimya Dawson is the heart of the album: with a unique, half-adult half-teenage sound that captures the essence of Juno. Throw in Sonic Youth's almost-whispering cover of the Carpenter's \\"Superstar,\\" Barry Louis Polisar's upbeat \\"All I Want is You,\\" and Mott the Hoople's \\"All the Young Dudes\\" and you've got a well-balanced album of  smooth sounds and catchy tunes. (and it's 100% eco-friendly!) An amazing album, A MUST HAVE for your collection. You WILL enjoy it! Personally, I didn't like this particular genre of music before I heard this album. It opened my mind to a new sound. Thank you, Juno. Thank you Kimya Dawson. And thank you color-safe bleach.

B0011TQLA2|5.0|On Dec. 10, Radiohead actually shut down the download section of their web site.  Don't let this keep you from getting this album.  IN RAINBOWS is Radiohead's finest collection of songs since the early 1990's.  It is the soundtrack to my life...incredibly beautiful, uplifting and haunting at the same time, this is an album that you won't just listen to, you will become engulfed by it.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|***** 1922. Loosely adapted from Bram Stoker's [[ASIN:0743477367 Dracula (Enriched Classics Series)]], NOSFERATU was directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Undoubtedly, THE DVD release of 2007. The one and only Dracula was Max Schreck whose performance haunted the nights of generations of movie lovers. Like me. Masterpiece.
B000286S8S|2.0|The song list is great. I don't care that the Dave stuff is mixed in with the Sammy stuff. It's all good.    The two stars are there because of the mastering job. What \\"remastering\\" really means is this: \\"We're going to throw a bunch of compression on the original mix. It doesn't matter that we're adding distortion (where it doesn't belong), raising the noise floor, and killing the dynamics, as long as we can get more level out of it. The folks that mastered Van Halen's previous studio albums didn't know what the hell they were doing anyway.\\"    I would never have bought this if it wasn't for the three new Sammy songs. Unless you need the complete Van Hagar era, stay away from this.

B000TGCR38|4.0|Film is set in 1944 in Holland at the close end of the WWII.  Main protagonist is young Jewish woman Rachel fighting to survive.  As her hiding place in the countryside is accidentaly destroyed, she becomes unwilling participant of destiny set in her path.  Rachel becomes part of the Dutch resistance, she infiltrates local German SS team by gaining a job in their headquarters and becoming a mistress to one of the high ranking officers.  What neither German officer not Rachel expected is that they genuinely fall in love with each other.  Most of the time when we think of love, we think of passion, ideals, culture or interests that bind people together.  But these two lovers have other things in common:  they are both lonely in a harsh world of WWII and with no families of their own, both are disillusioned with the war and endless killing associated with it, they are stranges in their respective worlds but yet forced to be a part of it.  It is particularly interesting to watch Rachel as she experiences anti-semitism in all its forms: farmer reminds Rachel that Jews would not have problems that they do should have they accepted Jesus; her resistance comrades remind her that life of a Dutch person is worth more than a life of a Jew; and do we need to say anything about German's notion of Jews?  Rachel's spying career is short lived and she and her lover are subject to many double crossings on both sides.  Film develops as a thriller where we know that there is a mole within resistance, but cannot guess who it is until the very end.  I love the bittersweet end of the film where we see Rachel living in Israel, married, with children, experiencing spiritual peace while working with school age children in kibbutz; and experiencing war of a different kind for the rest of the time as Israel if fighting for its survival.  I loved complexity of the film, but also felt that certain parts of it (such as dying pubic hair) were unnecessary.  While director was probably going for the realism of the bleak situation the heroine was in, I found scenes to be juvenile, cude and voyeuristic.  That is why I gave this film only 4 instead of 5 stars. It is also imporant to mention that actor Sebastian Koch who plays German officer is fantastic in this role.  I hope we see more of this actor in internationally released movies because he has a great talent (check him out in the movie \\"The Lives of Others\\").e realism of the bleak situation the heroine was in, I found scenes to be juvenile, cude and voyeuristic.

B000TGELLY|5.0|The added footage makes this, all ready, great movie into a piece of exquisite art. Be aware of those who are criticizing this film with statements of discord such as the soundtrack isn't as good as the theatrical version or the extra footage bogs down the momentum. The soundtrack fits like a glove and the extra footage allows the film to breathe like a running stallion. You won't regret purchasing this version.
B000059GEI|2.0|This is one of those films in which one overlooks the title's literalism before they watch it, and then say 'duh' afterwards. There is truly nothing else in this film but \\"show business\\", one show after another after another...Aside from the entertaining animosity that Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey generate from each other, the only redeeming part of this film was Marilyn. From the first scene at the coat check-in counter, she lights up the film (incidentally, that is the best line in the movie when she says \\"I am temporarily between jobs...six-months temporarily\\" where only Marilyn could enunciate the word temporarily with a stress on each syllable). She also sings a few solos which are also fantastic, especially the first one \\"After you get what you want...\\". The rest of the film is filled with annoying, pointless musicals and vaudeville acts, which leaves you with the question, \\"which did I hate more, the actors or the music itself?\\" Johnnie Ray is particularly ridiculous in the film<br />  This movie is strictly for Marilyn fans only, and in that respect it is a must see! I would be very satisfied with a redacted version of the film that contained only the scenes with her in it.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|Add the extra footage, the great and insightful documentaries (which I love), and the subtitles, and this great film becomes something even more to rave about. I highly recommended this movie, not only as a testament of history but also as a moving and entertaining work of labor that proves that Fincher is a movie god who produces something that will pass the test of time (if the world lasts that long).
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|There's something pure about `Once'.  Instead of taking the route of most films in this genre it steers away from the drugs and immoral clich&eacute;s of musician pieces and focuses on the passion behind the music, the experiences and emotions that drive these two individuals to create beautiful music together.  `Once' is truly a one of a kid film, a beautiful and mesmerizing musical journey that comes only once in a great while.<br /><br />The story told is that of your classic boy meets girl story (or `guy' meets girl story) where we are introduced to a young man who plays music on the streets for money and fixes vacuums in his fathers shop, as well as a young girl who has a broken vacuum and a love for music.  They meet by chance but share a connection that no words can put into perspective for the audience.  It's through their music though that their connection is made manifest.  They are drawn to each other and we are drawn to them.  They fall in love, but a love that is not like most experienced in the cinema today, this is a pure love, a love of character and emotion, a love of human beings and not carnal desire.  This guy falls for this girl and she likewise falls for him because they share a common bond you don't share with just anyone.<br /><br />The film takes place over the course of a week where are two companions decide to make a record together.  They buy the studio time, they rehearse and then ultimately they record their album.  That is your story, but the story runs so much deeper than that.  When I watched `Dreamgirls' last year I was fortified in my belief that singing can be the purest for of acting, but `Once' takes the feeling of `Dreamgirls' and carries it much further.  When we watch actors (and real life musicians) Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova sing their songs (songs they themselves have written) we feel every ounce of emotion.  We feel compelled to respond to their calls, they pleads; their desires.  We are taken deep into their souls.<br /><br />One thing to notice when watching `Once' is that neither our main actor or our main actress is given a name.  This to me makes it all the more relatable.  These two could be anyone in the world, they could be you or I or our friends.  By not giving them a title other than `guy' and `girl' they become even more understandable and accessible.  I truly adore this aspect of the film.<br /><br />As a longstanding fan of the Irish pub music made popular by the amazingly talented Damien Rice I was thrilled to see Glen Hansard do this film.  His musical style is breathtaking and warm and he delivers a very strong performance for someone who is not a quote-unquote `actor'.  Marketa Irglova also delivers beautifully.  Both are very natural and convincing, portraying real people, no gimmicks or dramatized emotions.  They add to the pure quality I mentioned on the outset.  This movie feels real; it feels natural and graceful and in the end attains all my respect and admiration.  One of the best films of the year, most definitely.br /><br />One thing to notice when watching `Once' is that neither our main actor or our main actress is given a name.

B000VAPZM2|5.0|My three year old daughter loves this movie.  She watches it over and over.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|If you've seen the magical film `Once' then you've already had the privilege of hearing most of these tracks, and most likely you've sought out the soundtrack for you leisure listening.  I know that that is a broad assumption, but I personally can't understand how anyone would not want to listen to this beautiful musical compilation over and over again.  I think it helps that I am smitten with a very similar act, Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan, and so listening to Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova feels comfortable and warm like.  Listening to this album brings back memories of the splendid film (truly `Once' is a magnificent cinematic experience) and that also makes each and every track dear and special and well worth multiple listens.<br /><br />The album opens with the musical catalyst for the film; `Falling Slowly', a song that drives home the pure emotions of the film.  That feeling of falling is manifest in each line of the song.  There are a few songs here that tap deep into the emotions of the singers and in effect illicit genuine reactions from the listener.  Another like this is `Lies', a song that Glen sings in the film while watching home videos of his ex-girlfriend, one he trusted and loved deeply only to be hurt beyond repair.  Having seen the film the song strikes a deeper chord with me.  Probably the most heart touching track here is Marketa's `The Hill', a song sung with such pure emotion that I was brought to tears while watching her perform this in the film.  It's a beautiful song about loving someone who doesn't seem to understand what you need, who doesn't seem to try as hard as you'd like to make the relationship work.  It's utterly mesmerizing.<br /><br />Songs like `Leave' and `All the Way Down' (one of the best tracks on the album) are stripped down and beautifully performed.  They dig into the skin and leave a lasting impression.  `All the Way Down' is such an emotionally resonant piece of music that I can't see how anyone wouldn't be touched by its soft spoken (or sung) words.  Irglova's `If You Want Me' feels like silk on the eardrums.<br /><br />Tracks like `When Your Minds Made Up', `Trying to Pull Myself Away' and the masterful `Say it to Me' are all heavier than the rest of the album.  It's not that they are `heavy' songs but they are not the soft, delicate tracks that litter the majority of the album.  Especially on `Say it to Me Now' Hansard really gets behind his lyrics with a force in his voice not seen in the majority of the tracks.  There is a scene in the beginning of the film where Glen Hansard is standing alone on a deserted street in a early stages of night belting out this track and it's utterly mesmerizing; a truly commanding performance.<br /><br />That leaves us with `Once', the title track that truly showcases the beauty of this pairing of Hansard and Irglova.  They have such chemistry together; magical.  `Gold' is probably the only track here I don't really care for.  It doesn't mesh well with the rest of the album and makes me wish it were omitted.  It's a small snag, but a snag to say the least.  `Fallen From the Sky' is the most unique of all the tracks here.  I enjoy it, even if it feels slightly out of place.  And then we have the hilarious `Broken Hearted Hoover Sucker Guy', a short clip from the movie of a song that was a spontaneous inclusion to the film, something Glen Hansard made up on the spot and was so funny it was included in the film.<br /><br />So, in its entirety `Once' is as magnificent a soundtrack as it is a film; both moving and masterful experiences that compliment one another effortlessly.  This is not an album you'll regret owning.  I highly recommend you seek out both the film and the soundtrack for a complete and magical experience.

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I thought this movie was the perfect blend of romance and reality.  Ok, so most people don't break out in song every three minutes but the story was believable.  The songs were sung with genuine longing.  How do they do that?      My husband thought it was ok.  He would probably give it a couple stars.  He said it was like an un-funny \\"Flight of the Conchords\\" episode.  Ha!

B000003N8R|4.0|Now this is a bit odd. Here we have John Coltrane, a guy best known for launching aural fireworks out of his saxophone, a guy known for expanding the sonic vocabulary of the tenor sax the way Hendrix did for the guitar, playing a soft, gentle album that's heavy on what seems to be introspection. But hey, I like it, odd as it may be. It's not one of Coltrane's several Class A recordings (which I deem to be Blue Train, Giant Steps, Coltrane's Sound, My Favorite Things, Live at the Village Vanguard, A Love Supreme, Ascension, First Meditations, Stellar Regions, and The Major Works of John Coltrane), but it still belongs on your shelf once you've drained all of those dry. And another thing - I just adore \\"Wise One\\", which positively shimmers - the interaction between Trane and Elvin Jones is key to what makes that song work. The title song, which rises and falls like waves, is also close to \\"masterpiece\\" level. These two songs are offset by the more uptempo \\"Bessie's Blues\\", a slight, brief blues-based recording that throws off the mood. Don't ask me what it's doing here. I mean, it would've sounded okay on Giant Steps, but it's jarring in this context. I'm not all that big on \\"Lonnie's Lament\\", either. As far as I'm concerned, \\"Crescent\\" and \\"Wise One\\" do the same slooooooow ballad thing much better. But Cltrane's never one to stay in a rut for long, those rare times when he gets into one at all, and he saves himself with \\"The Drum Thing\\". Now the obvious focus of the song is the drum solo, which is one of the best drum solos I've ever heard - and it's the best drum showcase tune ever recorded - but what really gets me is the melody. I love it when musicians sneak world music into their melodies, and that's what Coltrane does. It works fine as a drum solo, but it also could have worked fine as a more traditional song, with a melody that good. Killer tune either way. In truth Crescent is a bit uneven, containing Coltrane both at his best and at his worst, but when Coltrane's at his best, few can compete. So while Crescent is a nice album, it's a mere warm-up act for what would come next: A Love Supreme, possibly the greatest album of all time.ane's at his best, few can compete.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|My review is not on the music itself.  Others are more capable of discussing the merits or lack thereof.  I enjoyed In Rainbows and rate it five starts but the point of my review is on the quality of the CD compared to the original download.    I downloaded In Rainbows when they first released it and paid nothing. My wife says I am lame for doing this but my reasoning was that I didn't know how good the quality would be ... sure enough 160 kbs not even variable bit rate!    Anyways I bought the CD last week and ripped it to FLAC.    The verdict?  Much better and the greater detail is easy to hear ... Radiohead typically has a lot of little nuances to their music and the full resolution of the CD makes these liitle details easier to notice.  In fact the download was disappointing but the sound of the CD is amazing and more than makes up for it.    You don't need expensive equiment to appreciate the difference you simply need to listen to the music.  Even my wife who is nearly tone deaf and shakes her head when I discuss soundstage, imaging, and other things she normally cannot discern has remarked how much better the CD sounds.    In short, if you like this album you owe it to yourself to buy the CD and rip it to at least 192 variable bit rate to fully enjoy what Radiohead has created on this album.  I'm also very glad I paid zero for the download.  Which my wife still considers lame.
B000RHJQRO|5.0|This isn't quite the best album '70s rock album - the Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers has it just barely beat - but it is the definitive one. It's loud and bombastic, stuffed with power chords, power ballads, power screams, and synthesizers. This obviously led to arena-rock, a subgenre I'm not too fond of, but as such things often go the original arena-rock album is by far the best.<br />Part of what sets this apart from arena-rock excess is the INTELLIGENCE of the record. It isn't just a bunch of idiots strutting around screaming \\"DO ME NOW!\\" while guitars blast behind them then doing a total 180, whipping out an acoustic guitar and crooning, \\"Woman, I beseech it upon you to kindly procreate with me.\\" No, Pete Townshend is too smart of a lyricist and arranger to fall into a trap such as that. Instead, the lyrics are insightful and witty. And the synthesizers, rather than just used as gimmicks, are instead incorporated flawlessly with the songs and played with a lot of creativity. And the guitar passages are always inspired. The first and most famous song, \\"Baba O'Riley\\", is a fine example and my favorite Who song. It starts off with a repeating synth loop - the first time I heard it, it annoyed me, but after a while I grew to appreciate the way Townshend layered it. And it's not just the synth part, either - the song only gets better from there. The immortal idiot Keith Moon lays down one of his best drum tracks, while John Entwistle's bass, mirrored by Townshend's guitar and piano, keeps a steady pulse going. Then Roger Daltry jumps in, treating us with a determined lion's roar. And as I said, the lyrics are amazing paean to individuality and rising above all the crap that happens in the world. After Pete's enjoyably minimalist guitar passage, this viola solo comes out of friggin' NOWHERE and the song becomes an Irish sea-chanty with dueling acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass, and drums - with that synthesizer from the beginning still going. It's great. The legend goes that this was Keith Moon's idea, and that does strike me as a Moon thing to do. Now, nothing could match \\"Baba O'Riley', but they do a very respectable job following it up with \\"Bargain\\", a ramshackle rocker with acoustic textures, a memorable synth, and Pete's lovely, quiet bridge - he also sings on \\"Baba O'Riley\\", and I really like his voice. \\"Love Ain't For Keepin'\\" is slight, and easily the weakest song on the album, but Keith Moon's solid drumming makes it entertaining enough. And besides, up next is the classic \\"My Wife\\", a radio favorite that you may know as the best and funniest song John Entwistle ever wrote. In the tradition of \\"Heaven and Hell\\", it's a barnburning, black-humored rocker, in this case about a guy who had \\"a bit too much to drink\\" - and now his wife is out to get him. \\"Give me a bodyguard, a blackbelt judo expert... with a MACHINE GUN!\\", when taken into context, is one of the most hilarious lyrics ever written. The French horn is great, too. Another little touch of humor. Fun story about it - John's wife Alison loved the song, and suggested coming onstage when they played it, chasing the members around with a rolling pin. It probably wouldn't have looked out-of-place, and it's a shame it never happened.<br />Now, the next two songs are a point of some minor controversy for Who fans, but I like 'em both fine. \\"The Song Is Over\\" especially gets crapped on a lot, because of how bombastic it is. What, and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" ISN'T bombastic? This album IS bombast, people, but it's the most enjoyable bombast you'll ever hear. It's a gorgeous song, I think, with the symphonic layer of synthesizers and Pete's wonderful vocals and all-too-brief guitar solo contrasting with Roger's HUGE chorus (\\"I'LL SING MY SONG... TO THE FREE... TO THE FREE!\\"). Big-time tension release. Right on the money! In fact, it's actually one of my top five favorite Who songs. \\"Gettin' in Tune\\" kicks total butt, too. It might have the best intro ever, a statelypiano solo with John doubling up with one of his best bass lines, but it sure doesn't stay stately for long. First off it goes into total power-ballad mode, but again it's a CREATIVE power-ballad. Pete tunes his guitar so it sounds like a tenor sax. I think that's pretty cool. And then there's the ending, where Roger unleashes another of his screams and suddenly it's in gospel revival mode. Sweeeeeet.<br />So then it's back with another one of those little quirky, funny songs. \\"Going Mobile\\" is HIIIIILARIOUS, again sung by Pete. It's about living in a mobile home to dodge taxes and stuff. Mindless fun, but I love mindless fun. And then it's right back to the serious stuff, offering two big-time radio hits. I assume you know \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", and with its huge dynamic shifts from ultra-quiet to screaming anger, angsty lyrics, and emphasis on melody, it's almost the original grunge song. And like most the rest of this album it's tier-one Who. By the way, have you heard how soul-stealingly AWFUL Limp Bizkit's cover version is? I mean, I'm not a narrow-minded classic rock purist by any means, but Limp Bizkit is the worst band ever, so I thought I'd take a minute to laugh at Fred Durst and crew. Because they SUCK!<br />So the last song is a super-gigantic radio staple. It's called \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". You may have heard of it? Now, there's a lot of talk about it being the Who's greatest song, and I don't know about that, but it's one hell of a rocker. The synthesizers are, as usual, pure genius, as are Pete's numerous guitar solos. And who can forget those LYRICS? He trivializes EVERY revolution that EVER occurred, dismissing it with a cry of \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss\\" (okay, technically that's Roger, but Pete wrote it). Speaking of Roger, he's in top form here, especially with the \\"YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\\" to end all \\"YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\\"'s. And Keith's manic drumming is great. But if you ask me, it's Pete's lyrics, synthesizers, and guitars that really make that one work.<br />As I'm sure you know, this was salvaged from the abandoned Lifehouse project, an overambitious attempt at a multimedia rock opera that resulted in a nervous breakdown for Pete. Luckily, he recovered, and along with his bandmates delivered a milestone for rock as a whole. Any rock fan should own a copy of Who's Next, and that's the beginning and end of it.solo with John doubling up with one of his best bass lines, but it sure doesn't stay stately for long.

Speaking of Roger, he's in top form here, especially with the \\"YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\\" to end all \\"YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\\"'s. And Keith's manic drumming is great. But if you ask me, it's Pete's lyrics, synthesizers, and guitarsthat really make that one work.  As I'm sure you know, this was salvaged from the abandoned Lifehouse project, an overambitious attempt at a multimedia rock opera that resulted in a nervous breakdown for Pete. Luckily, he recovered, and along with his bandmates delivered a milestone for rock as a whole. Any rock fan should own a copy of Who's Next, and that's the beginning and end of it.
B000K3M1VI|5.0|This film is one for the ages.  The complex issues portrayed so deeply by this fantastic cast is remarkable.  I have seen this film at least ten times and each time I find another facet of one of the characters or a different perspective from one of my earlier viewing.  This is definitely a film that should be placed in a time machine or a time capsule so that one thousand years from now they will be able to see what twentieth century film making should really be.
B000003TAL|5.0|The original grunge album, only even more abrasive and cathartic - \\"Silver Rocket\\", for instance, has an instrumental break entirely devoted to feedback, and I don't know what to call those noises on \\"Eric's Trip\\", but they sure sound cool. And, of course, it's at least as good as it's made out to be. See, the thing about Sonic Youth is that they're one of those bands you've definitely heard of, but might not know a thing about. Okay, there's a good chance you know \\"Teenage Riot\\", a big hit and justly so, making excellent use of a tension-building intro. After the intro it gets even better, launching into a slightly disorienting but very worthwhile rocker. It's as focused and taut as a seven-minute song can get, and that's to its credit, since a couple songs, such as \\"The Sprawl\\", which starts as a solid Kim Gordon rant, gallop off into the sunset of feedback and totally lose me. For me, the guitar jamming sounds a lot better on the punkish \\"'Cross the Breeze\\", which transitions from a beautiful, VU-influenced introduction into a suspenseful guitar jam into a pump-the-gas rocker, complete with fantastic angry vocals from Gordon. Or \\"Total Trash\\", which has one of the catchiest and most distorted riffs I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. Nice bassline, too, if you can pick it out. And guitar buildup. I like guitar buildups. There's also some nice, if slightly bruising, near-pop on \\"Hey Joni\\". After that ends, the record's lone low point begins: the sound collage \\"Providence\\", a piano part with a bunch of tape loops played over it. Not my idea of a good time. But that's okay, because right after it is another solid rocker with a beautiful introduction and great vocals from Thurston Moore, \\"Candle\\". Near the end comes the bizarre but enjoyable \\"Kissability\\". After that co9mes the \\"trilogy\\". I don't know what to make of \\"The Wonder\\", which is packed with grungy, raw distortion. It sure is unique, though. The second part of this little suite is \\"Hyperstation\\", which uses feedback in a very creative, ominous way and contains the title phrase, for whatever that's worth. Both suite and album close with a jokey ZZ Top sendup, \\"Eliminator Jr.\\", one of the many examples of quirky humor on this disc. This really stands out when compared to the hair-metal and synth-pop that was dominating the charts in the '80s, and it's really held up well. It's not all that listenable, but it's plenty rewarding.ses feedback in a very creative, ominous way and contains the title phrase, for whatever that's worth.

006054094X|3.0|The book is well written and a good read.  While I did enjoy reading this book the entire there were many thins stated in the book that just destroy any credibility.  At the very begining of the book the author states that he came up with this concept, then went looking for evidence to support it.  Much of his evidence does not support his claims, and each very small piece of evidence he finds, he draws amssive conclusions from.  For example, there is writing on a stone on the Cape Verde islands that he believes is an Indian language, from this he draws that the chinese must have been there....??  This is basically the path of the entire book.<br /><br />Like I said overall a decent read, but a bit of a reach.
B00118RPQC|4.0|It could be said the third installment of the Spiderman franchise was almost too amazing but the difficulties presented by the storyline are partly to blame.     Chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to be a mixed bag and though I understand the desire to appeal to a wide audience by continuing to introduce tension between the two, it has begun to distract from the film while vectoring toward the mistakes made by George Lucas in Star Wars. MJ's character has only been developed as a pretty affection but lacks substantial integration into the script which Dunst is more than capable of carrying as a pretty decent actress. It's about time to dust off the checkbook and hire decent writers such as Peter David to make sure a smooth transition between plot, sub-plot, and character development.    The special effects were over the top and by that I mean the quality level was too low to make it seamless. Excepting Venom, the film fails like those before it to capture how menacing the city is after dark and in so doing it appears as if Spiderman is just doing what the police would ordinarily be doing if it wasn't for the bizarre appearance of super villians.     The story will capture your attention though it isn't all that compelling and in closing up loose ends from the first and second film there is a lot of room for future films if producers will allow enough latitude to develop characters while incorporating the numerous other superheroes Spiderman worked with a lot of the time.     Though the film caught a whole lot of criticism, it is worth seeing and the DVD is a welcome addition to any collection.
0679746323|4.0|Good book and well written.  The author injects a little more opinion on why Mao did various projects, took various actions and the like throughout his life, than what I would like.  All in all a very in depth and well researched book.
0743268091|4.0|Anyone who doesn't read this book is missing out. The End of Faith won the PEN award for nonfiction and deserved it. This is a devastating indictment of religion and the harm it causes. Just the chapter on Islam was worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Harris ranges far and wide, from the Inquistion's horrors to honor killings in the Arab/ Muslim world. He mercilessly attacks dogmatism, from the moral equivalence of the pacifist left to the insane attacks on birth control on the right. The part where he skewers the drug war was terrific. The book isn't perfect; Harris endorses unscientific paranormal beliefs (e.g. reincarnation and ESP). I also don't understand his argument that Communism is a \\"political religion.\\" But,overall, it's still well worth reading.

6305882592|2.0|It's 1971 folks and the evil Richard Nixon is the President of the United States.  A time capsule really, H & M tell us that our parent's aspirations: financial well being, a stable home life, love and security are all pathetic middle-class aspirations unworthy of modern children.  An 80-year-old, concentration camp survivor on steroids, Maude, Ruth Gordon, must teach the lesson.     The 60's makes less sense to me now than ever.  Good riddance!     By the way, the film is dull and pretentious.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|As someone who is not only a major Queen fan but also someone who works with Blu-ray technology, I can tell you for a fact that this is a fantastic video transfer.   Yes, there is some grain with dark shots but you can't compare a movie (where they have professional lighting) with a concert, which by definition is often quite dark.  (Grainy shots mean that they lightened those shots so you could actually see things.)  Most of this is very clear and clean and this concert, I can tell you, has never looked better!  (Check out any shot of Freddie or JT up close.)  If you are a Queen fan with the right set up I would not hesitate for a moment to get this one.  Great great great!  Nice job, Eagle Rock.

B000OLEQF0|4.0|A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the \\"sturdy\\" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands. Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent. A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.<br /><br />The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her. In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of \\"his\\" child. He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist. Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper. Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically. The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her. To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life. Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government. Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.<br /><br />Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living. The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader. Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity.

B00104W8T6|5.0|All in all this is a great CD. Came in yesterday and I've had it on repeat ever since.  Kimya Dawson's song are light and upbeat, with beautiful,if sometimes odd, lyrics. The other songs on the CD are in the same vein, light, upbeat folk style love songs. As most people have already said, Ellen Page and Michael Cera's duet is a beautiful cover of the Moldy Peaches \\"Anyone Else But You\\".This is one of the few soundtracks I had decided to buy before even leaving the movie theater. From the opening credits song (All I Want is You) I was hooked and hearing \\"Treehugger\\" about partway through the movie made up my mind.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|What can I say? Words will fail you while watching this new transfer of the all time best SciFi film, Mr. Scott's exceptional masterpiece.   I just did and the impression still has me speechless.    This review should just be a blank with ten stars and one advice: BUY IT!    The clarity of the picture, sharpness, sound, the tiny details, even in the darkness and the rain. It looks as if it has been shot yesterday.  I prefer Ridley Scott's final version, included here on disc one. It has several added and extended scenes which makes it all a little easier to understand. Although I admit this has become difficult to judge after having watched the film so many times.   Also included are the 82 international and US theatrical versions, the 92 director's cut and the workprint version. For details on these see amazon's description above.  I love Philip K. Dick's writing, so I was very happy to have a featurette and an audio interview included in the set.  Why this 5 disc box?   Please don't ask - as I said, this doesn't need words, please, just get it!   You won't be disappointed, you can't be.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Very, very good movie for the whole family.  Being interested in the South Pacific ever since visiting Hawaii I decided to watch this when it came out.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|This was my first foray into Martin Scorsese territory in years--since I fled, screaming, after being bored to tears by the director's insipid \\"Gangs of New York.\\"  And now I've got Scorsese--and annoying Leonardo DiCaprio--teaming up again, only this time a boatload of Hollywood talent is in tandem.  The result:  A gritty, good cop/bad cop thriller that had me at the edge of my coveralls; THE DEPARTED delivers the goods enthusiastically, augmented by nonstop F-bombs and enough over-the-top Beantown twang to shame a sold out Fenway.<br /><br />DiCaprio and Matt Damon headline this flick, and both give solid performances as two cops--one corrupt, the other bipolar but honest--literally looking for each other.  In fact, this is the very first time DiCaprio actually looks, and comes across, as a grownup--not some gangly adolescent running around on an ocean liner.  Yet Jack Nicholson (and doesn't he always?) creepily steals the show, playing an underworld kingpin--the target of an intense police investigation--aided and abetted by a very capable, and nasty, lieutenant (Ray Winstone).  Nicholson chews up every scene he's in with an eery dominance that lends a plethora of cred to the plot and story--a story that moves with breakneck speed.<br /><br />Yet this movie is populated with other heavy hitters that make it so much fun to watch, movers and shakers like Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg.  These guys drop their F-bombs and answer their cell phones and contribute to the story in grand fashion.  With his stellar cast Scorsese takes you through a breathtaking, incredibly violent ride, culminating in an ending that took me completely by surprise--and absolutely made me go, \\"Wow.\\"<br /><br />As this is the two-disc special edition you'll also enjoy (or maybe not) several deleted scenes, some of the cast talking about gangster movies, and Martin Scorsese talking about. . .Martin Scorsese.  And why the heck not?  This director can talk it up all he wants; THE DEPARTED is definitely one of his best efforts, a tour de force not to be missed.<br />--D.

Oh sorry I'm drambling again that delicous dream ramble. This long player is genuinely overated, not at all bad but not that great either. If you don't believe me listen to the last track (the one about taking out the back seat and driving your grandma around from the back seat looking like the cool b*****d that we are) and tell me it doesn't have more emotion than the rest of the album put together? hah what was that? darkfathers cat (rattler age 2) got ya tounge? The saddest thing is that the track shows the band's potential when they decide not to plod but I thought Indie in all forms was supposed to be dangerous or inspiring. Sonic Youth lolling through Starpower or Fugazi ripping through Public witness program. Don't expect that raw emotion here but don't expect bad music here either, or so David says anyway.
0740748475|5.0|This is a gorgeous, high quality collection. The printing is lovely, the paper is heavy and very rich.<br /><br />My only complaints are that I wish the author's introduction was longer and that this is a heavy, heavy set which makes pulling the volumes out and reading a bit inconvenient.
158270208X|5.0|It is true that this book is a journal.  It is a well done, beautiful journal in keeping with the other high quality items Rhonda Byrne has put out.  One of the other 5 star reviewers gave an accurate description of the book, but I'm going into a little more detail so people who are considering buying it may be able to understand why they would want to purchase this to record their special and empowering thoughts every day instead of a plain old book or notebook.<br /><br />The book is small in size which makes it very portable.  The cover is not leather, but it looks like leather and is embossed with gold lettering and symbols.  The paper is high quality and the pages are not stark white, but a nice \\"easy on the eyes\\" warm color.  Each day has a \\"secret\\" thought for the day and the word for \\"thank you\\" in a different language.  (I haven't counted how many different languages there are.)  The book has a \\"rich\\" look to it.  If you've read or watched \\"The Secret\\" and you understand the Law of Attraction and how important gratitude is you'll understand why it's important to have a special book you love to write your important thoughts in every day.<br /><br />You could buy this book without an understanding of \\"The Secret\\" and find it useful and nice.  But I think it would be best used in conjunction with the book or DVD to further anchor the empowering thoughts and feelings that make the Law of Attraction work in a good way for you.
1401201911|4.0|To begin with I'm not the biggest superman fan.  I believe he has a tendency to be written a little flat and not very dynamic personality wise.  Which is ironic given his physical abilities.  Which is one of the reasons this comic blew my mind and just when i thought i put all the pieces back in my skull it blew it again.      Superman is given a whole new dimension (personality wise) here and his character is so rich and the artwork beautiful the pages might as well ooze beauty.  The alternative histories for other major DC heroes, Green Lantern and Batman most notably, collide with Superman's and changed the way I viewed those characters could be written.    My few complaints fall under an umbrella of \\"realism\\" that is embedded in the comic.  In short no one can stand up to Superman effectively.  Some of the DC's most prestigious members go up against this guy and fall drastically short.  That is realistically what would happen if Superman would have to fight these in the conditions set by the comic.  That is why the comic is so great even my complaint fits in with something good about this comic.    If you like alternative histories.  Or often think about what would happen if characters were put in different situations and how they would react in character and development read this comic like its the answer to all your problems.  Even though its not.  But it could be...
1582701709|5.0|Almost a year ago I read this book after seeing Rhonda Byrne on Oprah.   If you're the type of person who is receptive to change and open to ideas other than your own, maybe it can do for you what it has done for me?  I'm not wealthy yet, but I have more money than I've ever had before and I'm the happiest I've ever been! People respond to kindness, love, my positive outlook, and my happiness--all things that knowing and applying the Law of Attraction have brought to my life.    I read the book first and loved it. Then I watched the DVD and it gave me a chance to further anchor the ideas and to see the teachers who are in the book. Seeing them and hearing their voices helped me remember and apply what I had learned in the book.      Some people are too critical and too hard on this book.   What's wrong with thinking love instead of hate, abundance instead of lack, and working proactively instead of being against everything? The people who react so negatively to the concepts in this book are precisely the people who need it the most!  The information in the book is only as good as the effort you use to apply it.  If you're skeptical and critical, sure--it isn't going to work for you--only against you!    Rhonda Byrne comes right out and lists many of the people through the ages who knew \\"The Secret\\" which is really the Law of Attraction. She never maintains that \\"The Secret\\" is something she invented or made up. The Law of Attraction has biblical origins.  The reason it's called \\"The Secret\\" isn't because it is the \\"shhhh!\\" kind of secret, but because the Law of Attraction is the secret to living happily and with an abundance of good things of many kinds.     I know the concept of the Law of Attraction seems hard to believe, but I've seen it work good and bad ways in my own life. Now that I know how to use the law, I'm living a much richer life in so many ways!  My coworkers have responded warmly to me, more things go my way, and good things have come to my life.  People used to call me a \\"worry-wort\\" (a long time ago!) now even my kids have noticed a change in me.  My daughter said, \\"Mom, you're so calm now!\\"
B00006IM9Q|5.0|One of my three all-time favorite CDs, \\"Blondie Platinum 2CDs 1998\\" is not the exact copy featured on this page. However, this was closest and differs in only two songs. I want to review this music because Blondie is such great driving music!<br /><br />\\"Island of Lost Souls\\" is playing now. As I am writing, I am bouncing in my chair. Is this calypso music?<br />Then there's \\"Call Me.\\" This song and Richard Gere are inextricably bound with American Gigolo, a movie that stands the test of time.<br />\\"Rapture\\" is one of the top songs in her repertoire (says I). I think it is early rap/hip-hop, Deborah Harry-style.<br />\\"Rip Her to Shreds\\" is another favorite. It's so viciously yummy!<br />\\"The Hardest Part\\" is a drive-with-the-nieces-and-nephew and dance at the top of our lungs, pulsing the beat with our arms banging in the air. Rock on!<br />\\"One Way or Another\\" I'm gonna getcha, I'm gonna getcha getcha getcha....I think Sting had a similar song.<br />\\"Hanging on the Telephone\\"--just stay on and he can never leave ya, another stalking song<br /><br />Just a few for you. A reminder of how great the music of Deborah Harry and Blondie is. If you like this kind of music. If you like innovation and some edgy stuff.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It's extremely difficult to describe the music on Sufjan Stevens' ILLINOIS.  It's unlike anything I've ever heard in my entire life.  Upon first hearing it I felt like Saleri listening to Mozart's compositions for the first time. Though the music will not appeal to everyone, it's so unique and refreshing I suggest that anyone who enjoys real music listen to ILLINOIS a few times just for the experience.  Some of my favorite songs from the album include:<br /><br />\\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!\\"--the song that comes closest to being a theme song for the State of Illinois on the album.  The song is very upbeat, alluding the hope in the future and the promise of progress of the World's Columbian Exposition that was held in Chicago in 1893.  The song also has an allusion to a downstater, author and historian Carl Sandburg.<br /><br />\\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\"--this moving and emotionally ballad refers to the famous serial killer from Illinois.  The song basically tells the tragic biography of Gacy.  Gacy was a well-respected, nice man that everyone who met seemed to like, but he abused and killed many young boys.  The song uses Gacy as a metaphor for the evil actions that all of us commit in our thoughts and hearts.<br /><br />\\"Jacksonville\\"--a country-feeling, yet upbeat song about the middle-state city that was named for Andrew Jackson and was a major stopping point of the underground railroad.<br /><br />\\"Chicago\\"--having grown up in southern Illinois, I have mixed feelings for Chicago, the city that literally means \\"stinking weed\\".  However, even though the city is mentioned and referred to several times in other songs on the album, I guess it's only fitting that the album contains at least one tune just for Chicago.  The first time I heard the song I didn't like it very much, but the more I listened to it, the more I came to like it.  In that regard, Stevens' \\"Chicago\\" is just like the city it is named after.<br /><br />\\"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\\"--just looking to the title one would think that this song is about Metropolis, IL and the giant Superman statue in the town.  But it's much more.  The song has a driving percussion beat and guitar medley in the chorus emphasizing the positive feelings that Superman conveys.  Superman was one of the first Christ-like characters to appear in comics and the song uses that imagery, meditating on the real man of steel.<br /><br />\\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!\\"--of all the songs on the album, this song is the one most obviously spiritual and is full of religious imagery.  The song is a hymn about the beauty of creation and the Creator who made it all. `Lamb of God, we sound the horn/Hallelujah!/To us your ghost is born. Hallelu'<br /><br />\\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From the Dead!!  Run for Your Lives!! AHHHHH!\\"--the music of this song is very rhythmic, direct, and repetitive (especially the spelling chant of I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S) and makes the song feel like an army of marching zombies attacking.  The song mentions many of the great people who were born, raised, and that lived in Illinois from Ulysses Grant to Ronald Reagan.  It also mentions several towns and cities in Illinois.  In general, the song seems to be a call to arms to not forget the people and places (most from common origins) that made the state great; the remembrance of those people and places should inspire the citizens to rise and make the state great again.<br /><br />Overall, a unique album of music full of vivid images, spiritual allusions, and powerful metaphors.  The music is original and smart.  Highly recommended, especially for people looking for a fresh and different sound.this song is about Metropolis, IL and the giant Superman statue in the town.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I am being audacious to review music by the great Bob Dylan. Be that as it may, \\"Modern Times\\" is one of my all-time favorite CDs and I have something to say. Thoughts gel when they are written.<br /><br />I fell in love with Bob Dylan's music in college in the 60's, at the beginning, dragging his albums home for my mother to hear. Ug, she didn't like him, but \\"The Times they were a changin'\\" in so many ways, almost as if Dylan heralded them. I was there, went with the flow on \\"Highway 61.\\"<br /><br />So many years have passed. He's been down so many roads, as have I. He is again heralding new times, modern times. He is searching for Alicia Keyes, I am searching for Gerard Butler. It's \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" and he is still traveling. The music is great. He is still following his King and his religious vows. Awesome. I'm following the same ones.<br /><br />\\"Spirit on the Water\\" voices the fact that we can always fall in love no matter our age. This song brings tears every time I hear it. The vagaries of aging is worrisome --in the mirror, on the road, in the body. \\"You think I'm over the hill, you think I'm past my prime. Let me see what you got, we can have a wonderful time.\\" There goes that harmonica and steel guitar playing the closing refrain, just like a couple romping together. Or could be the song is about the vagaries of fame? Dylan, still with his finger on the pulse of his \\"Age.\\"<br /><br />\\"When the deal goes down\\"--Here is the road of life and there the time of death. We all struggle to love and forgive. Where will you be on your road of life \\"when the deal goes down\\"? Are you ready?<br />\\"Someday Baby\\" is pure blues. \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" spotlights his sometimes melodious voice in another bluesy song, this time celebrating work and love.<br /><br />\\"Beyond the Horizon\\" is a lovely ballad about life \\"beyond the horizon.\\" \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" adds the melancholy of a cello solo (another reviewer says viola). He says prayer has the power to heal, love your neighbor, do good to others. Aint talking, just walking, heart burning, still yearning. You get no mercy once you've lost. And he ends the song \\"in the last outback at the world's end.\\" Cello is back for its last solo. What Dylan says to me-- and I have walked a similar road (minus fame and money),-- that if you live your faith, the end of the world is not to be feared.<br /><br />I am not only audacious, I am bodacious in extending these ideas about Dylan's music. Anyone who reads this is walking a path with Dylan and me, exploring this new direction beyond the horizon in these modern times. I \\"aint' talkin\\" no more., just walking, heart burning, still yearning. You get no mercy once you've lost. And he ends the song \\"in the last outback at the world's end.\\" Cello is back for its last solo.

0316010669|5.0|Blink is a book about the human brain. While it helps the reader better understand how the human brain works, don't expect to be able to use that understanding to your advantage. In fact, while the book provides a fascinating discovery of how the human brain \\"thin slices\\" both people and events, the main takeaway from this is that thin slicing is either accurate or it's not.<br /><br />Gladwell points out some cases where thin slicing based on limited information is just as accurate (or more accurate) as making a decision on piles of research. In other cases, thin slicing causes us to have wrong impressions about a person and therefore causing us to make wrong decisions. Even still, there are the instances where thin slicing completely fails and everything goes sour.<br /><br />The one thing I did take away, is that the human brain is not always capable of allowing us to verbally explain the things we do or think. Unless you're particularly skilled in a certain area, once you try to explain why you initially think this or that, the reasoning begins to break down and often fails entirely. This can then cause us to come to conclusions that are contrary to what we really believe. Strange, yeah, I know.<br /><br />That's what makes Blink fascinating. The human brain is so complex that it often doesn't even work in the ways we would think. But it can be trained. Immerse yourself into something and your brain develops the capability of knowing why you like or dislike certain things or even to read things in high-stress situations that the normal person would not.<br /><br />As a business owner I didn't find Blink to be as useful as The Tipping Point, also from Gladwell, but the author does have a way of bringing oddities to light and presents them in a fascinating way.
B000025XE5|5.0|Who can't relate to being a teenage boy. You're at a dance, and there she is, the most otta sight girl. You never dreamed her up in any of your fantasies. Yet there she stands, and all you need to do is smile, be polite, and ask her for a dance. By the time you decide to do it, guess what, the music stops, and the lights come back on. All you can do is sigh, and hope she's there (alone) at the next one. Maybe you can do it then. That type of image of \\"love\\" was what The Troggs was all about.  Something so close, but yet so far away.

0061142026|3.0|I purchased this book after reading the summary listed on Amazon and thought it would be quite interesting. However, the author did not seem to want to go into much detail. He had crafted some amazing ideas, but overlooked some of the opportunities to develop them. There was alot of potential that he missed out on. Other than that, I found the book to be rather enjoyable. I would recommend the book to readers who don't have to much time to get drawn into other more developed books.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Okay, I've heard and read the reviews.  What's up with that?  The only way I could imagine that someone considers this stuff funny is if their own family is that cruel and mean to each other on a constant basis.  I've worked very hard to create a safe and kind environment in my home.  Why do I want to be placed in the middle of this ugly family and experience the hatred, anger, cussing, disrespect, and sexuality that this innocent little girl has to bear?  Is this how bad the typical American family has gotten that most people rate this movie as fun to watch?  I felt like a piece of my soul was taken after experiencing this film.  If that means I'm too innocent - I would have rather have kept that innocence, and not traded it for the yuck feeling I had watching this unhappy family.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|A talented musician in Dublin has let himself go after his girlfriend left him for London. A beautiful Czech girl helps him to reignite his passion for life and music. It's a simple story, but set in a real world where nothing is as simple as it might seem. The music is brilliant (I would compare it to the work of Damien Rice, though I think the voice of the man in this film is even stronger), and pervades the film, making it into something of a musical with lyrics that express indirectly the feelings of the characters and convey details of their pasts and their lives that lends a richness to the simple connection that is obvious between the two characters. The acting is strong, and while the cinematography is not as lush or polished as in more expensive films, it is just right for this story, and puts the emphasis on the characters where it needs to be. A perfect musical romance that avoids cliche and hits all the notes just right.
0965604926|5.0|My mother was raised during the War, and my grandfather was a Chinese soldier. My mother told me a chilling story of how my grandfather handed my grandmother a pistol, and told her, \\"Don't let the Japanese touch our daughters.\\"  Despite growing up and hearing dreadful stories about Japanese war atocities, there are no memorials, and no appolgies.    I have been to Japan twice, and it is a country which has erased the memory of its past.  Tokyo is an ultra-modern city with few historic references. The pre-war city was destroyed, and the post-war city found a new identity: commercially driven and blissfully naive.    Chinese of my generation have heard the stories of our parents, but very little is written about what happened.  Iris Chang was motivated by this same mystery to write her book.  She approached it brilliantly: explaining it from the point of view of a Japanese soldier, the Chinese victim and the neutral observer.    The story of the Nanking Massacre is filled with poetic ironies: a card-carrying member of the Nazi party saving thousands of Chinese people. People who followed their conscience and acted with great bravery.  Her book relied on finding records which were shared to her by the children of these brave observers. Iris Chang shares the process of her research; like a detective trying to investigate a crime scene.    A generation of Chinese, who are the childern of the survivors, are greatful for Iris Chang. I named my daughter after my grandmother, the woman who never had to use that pistol.  When my daughter is old enough to appreciate her heritage, I hope she'll read this book.  It's something that we need to remember.
B00008DDRX|3.0|Make no mistake about it, Steve McQueen was one of the finest actors of his generation with such landmark films that resonate like an elegy in the cinema canon: \\"The Great Escape,\\" \\"Bullitt,\\" \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" etc. These films defined the strong male characterizations that are lacking in today's films with male characters more at home in a metrosexual guise than the potent aura of control McQueen exudes on screen.<br /><br />This then leaves us with the question of \\"Le Mans\\" produced by McQueen's own company, Solar Productions. The film begs the question: is it a documentary about professional auto racing?  Or, is it a drama about the emotional and personal toll auto racing takes on the participants who drive at 240+ miles per hour where one mistake can make the difference not only between victory and defeat on the track, but also life and death? Then again, should \\"Le Mans\\" be seen as merely a vanity project for McQueen who sought to indulge his passion for racing (the actor himself, like Paul Newman, was a professional racer)on the screen?<br /><br />McQueen's film tries valiantly to answer these questions, but really only succeeds in the first.  The cinematography and direction is superb for a racing film, but where \\"Le Mans\\" comes up short is in drama.  There is very little dialogue or interaction between the characters.  Katzin's direction on the track and from the driver's point-of-view is excellent; the crashes have a gut-wrenching intensity to make even the bravest of us wince, and the director, thru the extensive use of close-ups and slow motion in some segments, cannot be faulted in this category.<br /><br />The interchange between Delaney (McQueen) and the widow of the man Delaney was invloved in a fatal accident with seems stilted and forced even though the characters are apparently drawn to each other. Katzin tries to have the characters speak not so much with words but with body language and eyes, but this is not very convincing. The discussion prompted by the widow as to why these men are compelled to race is never really satisfactory addressed and lacks the gravitas a scene like this should have.  What we have are snippets of dialogue that resemble a series of bad takes in what is otherwise a documentary film about professional auto racing.<br /><br />For racing purists, the film is a delight; McQueen fans will see yet another dimension of this multi-faceted actor in a very different type of movie.  I purchased my DVD at Rite-Aid for only $6.99 rather than the list price indicated here at Amazon.dow as to why these men are compelled to race is never really satisfactory addressed and lacks the gravitas a scene like this should have.

B00005MKA1|5.0|This is one of the most powerful records in the Bob Marley canon, probably my favorite by the reggae master.  The album is very mellow musically, boasting two of Bob's best love songs, \\"Is This Love\\" and \\"Satisfy My Soul\\".  The whole album is just excellent, in particular the haunting \\"She's Gone\\", written in the wake of the shooting at Marley's house when his wife left him briefly, fearing for her safety.  The lyrics convey a deep sense of longing, coupled with an evocative Junior Marvin guitar lick.  Other outstanding cuts are \\"Time Will Tell\\", \\"Sun is Shining\\", and the title track.  There are still political songs on this album, but perhaps not as overt as on other releases.  The songs here are more reflective, written by a man who has seen some of the consequences of daring to speak his mind.  They are the words of a man resolved to stand for his principles, but all too aware of the personal cost involved.<br /><br />The remastered version adds the superb bonus track \\"Smile Jamaica\\", the B-Side from \\"Satisfy My Soul\\".  The packaging is much nicer than the original CD release, as is the sonic clarity.  Island has really done a good job in reissuing the Marley catalog.  A reggae classic, highly recommended.
0060775858|5.0|I bought this book for my 2 yr old son a few months ago.  He loves it.  We read it almost every night.  When I tell him to pick out a book he always requests \\"The Moon\\".  He has learned the meaning of whisper from the old lady,  what rooftop means from the little toy house, what the moon is and when we read goodnight air he blows air out. Great book I can see why it is a classic.  We also like The Very Hungry Caterpillar, The Big Red Barn, Llama Llama Red Pajama, The Sandra Brown books and Dr. Seuss ABCs just to name a few.
B000001DTM|5.0|To me this is the best album in U2's canon, and my favorite album to come out of the 90s.  When I first heard Mysterious Ways on the radio, I was dubious at U2's new direction, having fallen in love with War and The Joshua Tree.  Despite my misgivings, I bought the CD and have never regretted it.  From the distorted opening riff and garbage can drums that power \\"Zoo Station\\" to the haunting keyboards on \\"Love is Blindness\\", I was hooked.<br /><br />\\"Ultraviolet(Light My Way)\\" is one of the best songs ever written in my opinion.  The music perfectly compliments the lyrics.  \\"So Cruel\\" is a beautiful song about a destructive relationship.  \\"The Fly\\" is a great, driving rock song and \\"Acrobat\\" is a passionate plea for strength in the face of adversity.  \\"One\\" may have the most telling lyrics written about the nature of love and it closes with one of the best riffs the Edge ever played.  Those are just some highlights, but I truly feel that there's not a weak song on this album.  There's even an outtake on the \\"One\\" single, \\"Lady With the Spinning Head\\", that's just as amazing as anything  on the album, but doesn't quite fit as thematically with the album as a whole.<br /><br />This album changed my life.  It made me pick up a guitar and try and write my own music.  It taught me lessons about faith and hope in the face of heartache.  All that may sound pretentious, but no other album that came out in my lifetime has ever affected me in the way this one has.  Most of my other favorites belong to other times and generations, but this one is mine.  I really think this is U2's masterpiece.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|I was hoping to see the oficial material of this new Genesis world tour after all the bootlegs I heard from it. Sure I knew what to expect, and I once again hit this same key: a wonderful idea that the band decided touring again over the world, but they lack the old energy from their previous concerts. Most part of the classic tunes are executed in a lower key, so they all miss that energy and Phil Collins felt the same way.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I still love the band, they continue to be spectacular musicians, every one of them, I still hope they change their minds and give us another album, or at least another tour, and the set of the show is very good. The only problem is that the songs are not executed in their proper keys, giving the impression that the band are tired or something like that. Besides, this is an item every fan should get and give a chance.
B00009P1O0|5.0|In my opinion, this is Neil Young's finest album.  The album is sparse, with personal, enigmatic, and sometimes bleak lyrics.  I first heard this when I was lucky enough to find a used LP in a head shop when I was in college back in the late 90s.  Needless to say, the album blew my doors off.  I'd already gotten in to Neil, courtesy of a classmate, but this album proved to be a real find.  I was elated when it was finally released on CD.<br /><br />There's just something about this album, my co-favorite of Neil Young's releases, along with After the Goldrush.  There is such an intimate vibe about this recording, as if you're present in the studio with the musicians.  The lyrics are cryptic in places, in others evocative.  Despite being recorded in 1974, the album is still relevant, exploring themes still affecting our modern world.  The album title was inspired by Nevil Shute's novel On the Beach, which describes the slow end of the world, as it succumbs to nuclear winter.<br /><br />The album opens with the jaunty \\"Walk On\\", a shot at some of Neil's critics and the lukewarm reception given Young's previous album, the bleak Tonight's the Night.  The second track, \\"See The Sky About to Rain\\" is one of Young's most beautiful, with the drums provided by The Band's Levon Helm.  Helm is also present on \\"Revolution Blues\\", along with Band-mate Rick Danko, who plays bass.  David Crosby plays rhythm guitar on this track, a dark odyssey through America's discontented underbelly.  Longtime cohort Ben Keith plays the dobro on the cryptic \\"For the Turnstiles\\", where Neil turns in some killer banjo.  The title track contains some of Neil's most impassioned electric playing, over a minimalist background.  The searching lyrics seem to be a quest for identity and direction amid a feeling of disconnect, perhaps as a cost of fame.  \\"Vampire Blues\\", describing America's fixation with oil shows how times really haven't changed all that much in 36 years.  \\"Motion Pictures\\" is another classic Neil Young ballad.  \\"Ambulance Blues\\" is an acoustic tour de force that takes on the voice of working class/rural America during the malaise of the mid-Seventies, again fitting these current troubled economic times.  Harmonica and fiddle add to the song's sonic palette.<br /><br />The digital remastering by John Nowland and longtime Young crony Tim Mulligan is superb.  These two gentlemen are also responsible for the mastering given to Young's first four albums, re-released in 2009.  If you're even a casual Young fan, you need to listen to this album.assic Neil Young ballad.  \\"Ambulance Blues\\" is an acoustic tour de force that takes on the voice of working class/rural America during the malaise of the mid-Seventies, again fitting these current troubled economic times.

0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild has two stories about 23 year olds who strike out on their own to Alaska, both having discovered, as teenagers, devastating family secrets involving their fathers, with whom they had had volatile relationships. One is the author, Jon Krakauer's story, and I wonder if that is why he gingerly handles the dads in each case. I was left with the feeling that neither story was fully told.    Primarily, Into the Wild is a book about Chris McCandless, who, in 1992 as a 23 year old, went to Alaska to fulfill his dream of living off the land. He died within 16 weeks. Chris had disappeared after he had graduated from Emory University, changed his name, and lived as a vagabond in the west. He met people, picked up jobs, and then headed to his ultimate adventure, to live in the wild.     Jon Krakauer, the author, was asked by the editor of Outside  magazine to write an article about the young man who had starved to death in an abandoned bus in the wilderness.  Readers responded strongly to the article, and Jon Krakauer followed up the article with a book.  A few people who had known Chris as Alex came forward, most only knowing him for a couple weeks. Chris (aka \\"Alex Supertramp\\") had kept very short notes on his experiences, and his family hadn't seen him for a couple of years.     Chris harbored anger towards his father, there are hints about serious dysfunction in his family, but Krakauer seems to soft pedal around what was going on. But you get hints that Chris was trying to exorcise his parents from his life, from his soul. He was a damaged fragile personality who was lost internally and put himself in situations where he would have to deal with physical survival rather than what was haunting him. Krakauer didn't provide the evidence for this kind of damage, just clues.    If Chris had been just a little more prepared he would have lived. He found himself trapped by a swollen river when he retraced his steps to leave the wilderness, returned to the bus where he'd been living, and therefore died. If he had taken a topographical map he would have seen that ½ mile downstream from where he tried to cross there was a place he easily could have been successful.    Mr. Krakauer had little to go on to write an entire book, so there are chapters about other people in history who disappeared in the wilderness in Alaska and in the Southwest (because Chris had camped there during his vagrancy.)     Mr. Krakauer then tells his own transformational experience climbing a peak in Alaska when he was 23, and his own demons with his father. Mr. Krakauer doesn't draw a clear picture of his own father either. He says his father was a: \\"volatile, extremely complicated person, possessed of a brash demeanor that masked deep insecurities. If he ever in his entire life admitted to being wrong, I wasn't there to witness it.\\" And then at the start of the next paragraph calls his dad a \\"kind and generous man.\\" Mr. Krakauer says that \\"long held family secrets came to light\\" where he realized that his father was less than perfect and that Jon Krakauer was consumed by a blinding rage - but leaves unanswered what the secrets were. He knew his rage at his father drove him out and away - what could a father have done to do this? We are not privy to this information or understanding.    I found the most impressive story of this book to be Jon Krakauer's - he was a prepared mountaineer, his tale is gripping.  I would have rather he expanded his experiences into a whole book than read about Chris McCandless' sad, shallow, tale.      As a note, the reason that I read this book is because I had seen the movie directed by Sean Penn. Mr. Penn filmed the movie on site and had the breathtaking scenery of the Southwest and Alaska to work with. He also could take license to embellish relationships that Mr. Krakauer could only guess at, and lastly, made Chris' relationship with his parents more black and white, which makes for a more clear tale.
B000000W5L|5.0|Simply the best rock and roll album ever made.  Everything good about the Stones is here on prominent display.  Keith's guitar never sounded as greasy, Mick's vocals never so sleazy.  From the opening racket of \\"Rocks Off\\" to the hard rocking coda of \\"Soul Survivor\\", this record takes you on quite the trip.  In between these two songs, you'll find elements of Boogie-Woogie (\\"Casino Boogie\\"), Blues (\\"Ventilator Blues\\", \\"Shake Your Hips\\"), Gospel (\\"Sweet Black Angel, \\"Shine a Light\\"), Country (\\"Sweet Virginia\\"), and mixtures of all of the above.  This tasty gumbo, which sounds like it was recorded on back porches, in basements, and in garages still stands as one of the most important albums ever made.  This is a must have for any serious music lover.
1563898586|4.0|Now I'm loving it, but I don't know if I ever would have gotten into the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen except for the fact that a great friend (thanks Mark!) gave my wife a copy of Volume I which he had bought to some fan book signing, and Kevin O'Neil drew a picture of Mina Murray in the frontispiece and inscribed it to my wife, who has also written a novel about the same character.  So I just put it in my bag when we went to Chicago and I figured it was either this book, or giving myself up to the sappy movie on the inflight movie channel which happened in this case to be THE ULTIMATE GIFT.  I wonder why Moore and O'Neil are so hellbent on keeping the past of Mina Murray such a dark secret.  I mean it takes right up until the middle of volume two until you find out (a little) about why she's always wearing that red scarf draped around her neck.<br /><br />Until then she's just relentlessly brave and svelte, first braving a Cairo dope den to find the neardead body of arch explorer Allan Quartermain, and then taking him to Paris to investigate the case of putains being hacked to death in the Rue Morgue by a gigantic beast who turns out to be--Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!  After that, the league, supervised by toadlike Campion Bond on behalf of Britich Military Intelligence--journeys to a girl's school in England where a series of young ladies are experiencing the miracle of immaculate conception.  It's a wild ride, and it culminates in a long drawn out battle in Limehouse during which Dr. Moriarty of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and a mad doctor I guess is supposed to be Fu Manchu battle it out for possession of stolen cavorite, a lighter than air element that England needs for its own secret space program.<br /><br />All very well and good, but now that I have progressed as far as THE BLACK DOSSIER I would declare Volume II the winner.  In retrospect Volume I suffers from the sort of tedious \\"cavorite, cavorite, who's got the cavorite\\" plotting, and also from the romance between Mina and Allan--that is to say, the romance is great but it begins in that \\"meet cute\\" way which is so predictable and insufferable.  As soon as you have a man and a woman who can't stand each other you just know they're eventually going to get together: Moore could have written this love story in a more sophisticated way.  He seems so determined to re-write every narratological convention but this \\"meet cute\\" business he just decided to feed us wholesale without even an apology, and it's stale meat from some other lesser writer's bag of tricks.  That said, I did enjoy seeing them melt their reserve and that iceberg of mutual dislike, and see Mina come to life again after Jonathan Harker and the divorce, not to mention you know who.and Allan--that is to say, the romance is great but it begins in that \\"meet cute\\" way which is so predictable and insufferable.

1592802974|5.0|Market Wizards is so far my favorite book on trading. The interviews contained in this book have both inspired me and helped me to develop my own trading system. Jack Schwager interviews a variety of traders, some devoted to fundamental analysis, others to technical analysis and others to a mix. By looking at the personalities and trading styles of these traders, I got a better idea of what kind of trading system would work with me. I have now read the book several times over, because I continue to find gems of useful information in subtle points made by the traders, and it never ceases to inspire me.    The point should be made that this book is not a textbook and it doesn't explore the concepts of fundamental or technical analysis in any depth.

006054094X|3.0|The name of Gavin Menzies book is somewhat misleading, for he alleges far more than just the discovery of America. From 1421 to 1423 a Chinese Armada  commissioned by the Ming emperor Zhu Di set sail on a voyage of discovery into the Indian Ocean. There's nothing controversial about that statement, but what comes next is: namely Menzies declares that this fleet rounded the cape of Good Hope, discovered South America, Australia, Antarctica, the Caribbean, the east and west coasts of North America, Iceland, Greenland, and the North Pole. All this in just the space of two and a half years! Obviously, no one could cover that much sea in that little time, so Menzies breaks up his fleet into five different groups, each one scurrying off to some different corner of the globe. Of course, when the fleets returned home Chinese isolationism forced all records of these voyages to be destroyed.     Menzies claims to have re-discovered these fantastic voyages through information contained in nautical charts of the day. The core of his argument then rests on the provenance of certain medieval maps that he says show landforms that Europeans supposedly had no way of knowing about on their own. The first such map, the Piri Reis, is an interesting specimen, it shows quit clearly the coast of what is today Argentina, but apparently was in existence for some time before Columbus discovered the new world. Reading the book one might get the impression that Menzies was the first person ever to think that to be at all strange; but in reality it's a famous historical oddity, and numerous explanations of it's creation have been put forward, from ancient Egyptians to space aliens; Menzies theory that it was charted by the Chinese fleet of 1421 is at least as good an explanation as any, and he is able to draw some circumstantial evidence to support his case; not enough to constitute any sort of proof, but at least something to think about.    Starting in section III Menzies then becomes a lot more speculative, hypothesizing about the further travels of his Chinese fleet; that's also the point where the narrative starts to run aground. The most obvious problem is the lack of proof for any of what the author is suggesting; with no direct evidence, he turns to circumstantial evidence, and as the book continues those circumstantial evidences become more belabored and consequently less believable. In one particularly tortured argument he goes so far as to suggest that the Inuit tribes of north America didn't understand the secret of fire (a line which got a hearty chuckle out of this reviewer). Throughout the book he continually refers to certain maps as being \\"remarkably\\" accurate, maps which anyone with two eyes can see to be anything but. Probably the worst example is the Waldseemuller world map, made in 1507 it shows the west coast of North America as a straight line. It's fairly obvious that the mapmaker didn't have any information about that part of the world (no European had yet explored there), but drew that straight line rather than drawing a continent with no boundary; nevertheless, to Menzies this represents absolute proof of a Chinese discovery in the early fifteenth century. How that information got from China to Waldseemuller is never really spelled out. Many other links in his narrative are also left undefined; leaving these supposed voyages to be based on the flimsiest of evidences, while the journey to the North Pole he describes on pages 343-357 as far as I can tell is based on no evidence whatsoever.     A massive 130 pages of appendices document all the facts brought forward in the book, but taken as a whole these facts don't lead where the author thinks they do. Again and again he must tell us how certain he is of his findings, because any reader not predisposed to believe will certainly have their doubts, and at the points where even he runs out of rationalizations he merely leaves off with an open-ended question. No doubt he is trying togive the impression that the burden of proof lies on the shoulders of his detractors, that they must somehow prove him wrong; but it just doesn't work that way: he has the burden of proof, he is the one making extraordinary claims, it lies squarely on his shoulders to provide the evidence to back up his assertions. He hasn't come anywhere close to achieving that goal. There's a few interesting ideas that are brought up in this book, but the end result is derailed by Menzies' hyperactive imagination.
B00006AUIG|3.0|A clean-up crew is commissioned to remove ceiling and floor tiles from a psychiatric facility that has been shut down for roughly 10 years.  They're pressed for time, given only two weeks to complete the job. The old building is enormous and surrounded by woods.  The internal atmosphere of the structure is chilling.  There are rooms where patients had once been put in isolation.  Rooms where questionable therapy had been administered.  A hallway that runs underground.  The crew shakes off the occasional pin-prickles of fear and tries to focus on the job at hand.  Tensions between the men rise as the creepiness of the hospital thickens.  And bad things begin happening...<br /><br />Let me first say that, craving a good psychological thriller I hadn't seen before, I began a discussion in an Amazon forum asking for some help.<br />The response was overwhelming.  Fellow lovers of this genre had many great suggestions, but the one recommended most was this movie. Which I excitedly bought, and watched, and felt let down.<br /><br />If I had accidentally come across Section 9 late at night on t.v., I probably would have enjoyed it much more.  I particularly expected the twist to be on a much larger scale. I liked watching it despite all, and would recommend it to lovers of its kind.  It's slow-moving and somewhat quiet, so if you prefer fast-paced-with-a-lot-of-action, this movie is probably not for you.
B000EGF0QY|5.0|I recieved this book as a gift from my husban who hates to read yet loves NPR. This is the first Sedaris book I've read. I'm a fan! I plan on purchasing more of his books. I'm very busy and I find that books of essays are better because I can read one essay at a time. I enjoyed reading about sedaris' French teacher and how to explain Easter in a second language.
B000X3VN46|2.0|I usually dont like to compare one artists new work in correlation to their previous projects, but being a huge nightwish fan, I find that impossible not to do when reviewing this CD. Firstly, I find Tarja's voice overwhelming, at odds with the music that she tries so desperatley to make sound like that composed by Nightwish. I feel she has a beautiful voice, but it does not belong in this genre.     I, as has everyone else, heard the \\"Her voice stands out from all other metal bands\\" and while this may be true, that is not necesarilly on a positive note. While I cannot argue that she is not without talent, such talent goes to waste on this album, when the music and the vocals are at odds with one another, Tarja trying to take the center stage from the powerful music behind her.     Lastly, and more of a personal affront than anything, I feel that the CD as a whole is bitter torwards her career with Nightwish. Looking down the list of names made me roll my eyes as she obviously is still at odds with her break from the band. Titles like \\"Damned and Divine\\", \\"I Walk Alone\\", and \\"our Great Divide\\" only speak to me that she is trying to do with a solo career what she tried to do with Nightwish; be the center stage Diva. And that she achieves perefctly with this album, a powerful presence trying to dominate that which she has left behind.
B000URDEB0|3.0|Listening to classic Nightwish, it almost seems like Tarja herself IS Nightwish, and that without her angelic voice what's left is just average metal.  This new album proves it.  While Annette is a competent and skilled singer she is just not on the same level as Tarja and it shows.  There is good in this album and it's not a bad listen but fans of Nightwish should approach it as they would a new group as this is a totally new creature.
B000MPSX34|5.0|I have watched this movie many times since it came out. It is one of those movies that just makes you feel really good about life.
0440238609|4.0|A thoroughly enjoyable story.  The worlds that the author spins are quite an interesting mix of our real world, our religious myths, and new worlds.  You won't find any old elves and trolls. I really enjoyed being immersed in these worlds.    The trilogy is best read as such. I found that I had way too many unanswered questions at the end of book one. But, and this is important, I couldn't wait to get those questions answered!  More is revealed in book 2, and of course it all comes together in the final.  Excellent craftsmanship of a trilogy!    As to the story itself, I found it to be a very interesting mix of sci-fi theories of multiple worlds and an exciting twist on some of our religious myths.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I never thought I'd like any JE better than Susannah York. I know -- it wasn't the greatest interpretation of the novel (which I've read at least five times) -- but Ms. York was wonderful.<br /><br />Then along came Ruth Wilson. Her performance was beyond exquisite. Subtle, sensuous, nuanced -- she brought out the real Jane Eyre. I could watch this production over and over and over again.<br /><br />If you only buy one Jane Eyre, buy this one.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|This was a christmas present for my niece.  It was just being released when I ordered it but it arrived very quickly and of course with Amazon efficiency.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Come on people this movie and most movies were created for the sole purpose of entertainment. If You want historical accuracy then watch the history channel or some other doccumentary. Now Im not going to say that this is the best movie of all time but as far as entertainment is concerned it is a awesome movie. I dont watch movies to nit pick every single defect I watch them to get away from reality just for awhile. Have fun some movies you are going to like some you arent. There is no need to over anyalize just enjoy the entertainment.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|So, I know the official review kind of touched on this, but I wanted to put in my two cents. HIMYM is like the perfect combination of 'Friends' and 'Arrested Development.' If you loved either of those shows you will LOVE HIMYM. It has the sitcom/ comraderie feeling of 'Friends' with the sophisticated humor and season after season long jokes of 'Arrested Development.' The writing is so smart and well thought out. With many sitcoms you can find plot holes where the comedy comes first, but Carter Bays and Craig Thomas (creators/writers/exec. producers) have orchestrated such a clean, tight show that I have yet to discover any huge plot holes. (Not that I would stop watching if I did find any, but you know what I mean.) The way they play with time and the story-telling is truly genius. Please reference 'The Pineapple Incident' as an example (an awesome, awesome episode!). They have perfected the art of making a sitcom interesting and alive again. I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!
B0002234LS|3.0|David Koepp (\\"Panic Room\\") wrote and directed this horror/thriller flick, an  adaptation of a Stephen King story.  Johnny Depp sinks his teeth into the role of Mort Rainey, a successful author tortured by the memory of discovering his wife's infidelity.       Living alone in his gorgeous, rustic lake cabin, Rainey is plodding through the hum-drum writer's life (procrastination intermixed with drinking and breaking vows to stop smoking) when a mysterious stranger shows up at his front door.  John Shooter (John Turturro), who appears to be Mississippi Amish, claims that Rainey stole one of his stories, and he demands a reckoning.  It's clear from Shooter's stony gaze (and Turturro's inherent zaniness) that Rainey faces dire consequences if he does not comply.      Is Shooter telling the truth?  Can Rainey bluff his way through, or does he have to hire some muscle (Charles S Dutton)?  And what role does Rainey's soon-to-be ex (Maria Bello) and her lover (Timothy Hutton) play in the whole mix?    The Law of Economy of Characters, plus the knowledge that you're watching a Stephen King flick, basically gives away the creepy ending.  So you're left with the performances to keep you interested in the story.  For the most part, it succeeds, and largely due to Depp's willingness to find the  shadiest sides of his own persona.  What could have easily been a paint-by-numbers flick becomes something more interesting.    But it must be said that this is neither King's nor Koepp's best work.  \\"Secret Window\\" is a fine purchase from the bargain bin, but only the most die-hard King or Depp fanatic will keep putting this DVD back into the player several times.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid. I watched it at least once a month. Needless to say, when I found out there was a director's cut I had to get it and I am so glad I did. I cherish this DVD. There are many scenes that were cut out and seeing them provided a new depth to the characters. Excellent film.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The best gift to get for that person that buys what they want all year long! LOVE LOVE LOVE this DVD!!!
B000ICM5O4|5.0|I listened to this album constantly in high school back in the 70's to get myself psyched up for my wrestling matches, etc.  I decided to pick up a copy of this CD to see if it was still as good as I remembered it.  I wasn't disappointed.  It sounded great, much better than the old vinyl LP I used to listen to!  If you were a \\"Rocky\\" fan like I was, grab yourself a copy of this.  It'll bring back memories!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|The characters are well developed and you really get involved with their lives. Marshall and Lily will definately become one of the classic TV couples. Some highlights from season 2: 'World's Best Couple' and 'Showdown' are two of my favorites. But of course we can't forget 'Slap Bet' which is totally a classic already and lives on til this day in Season 3. Enjoy and share this amazing show with all of your friends!
0143038419|4.0|I have read about 75 reviews on this book - both prior to and after reading it. I enjoyed the book because I knew what it was about - the author. Plain and simple. It is a story of HER life, of what SHE felt, of what SHE went through, of what SHE discovered. She lets this be known up front. If you are expecting to have the woes of the world opened up and solved, then don't read this book. However, if you are wanting to read about ONE woman and her journey - through HER pain (not someone else's) - through HER eyes - as she finds pleasure, her own form of spirituality and then a combination of both - then this is a book to read. I find it somewhat appalling that people still have a knee-jerk reaction to how someone else states they feel. It is not for another to decide how SHE felt about her marriage or her divorce. It is not for another to decide how miserable and bad it was for her. Seems like a few reviewers might need to get over themselves quite quickly - besides, the wine industry is looking for a few new critiques. The book is as it is. Simple. Plain. The story of one person among billions. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I most enjoyed being able to laugh at someone who isn't afraid to laugh at herself.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Sure, Anchor Bay releases the same contents in different releases, but so does every other distributor.  The 1999 release was all sold out at Anchor bay, as well as at the major retailers.  Distributors print different covers so they can differentiate between different printings of each title.<br /><br />As far as the contents of this release goes, it's a as faithful of a presentation you can get for this film.  This is the best print available on DVD.  The Divimax version, on the other hand, sucks. When they made the Divimax version John Carpenter didn't supervise, so it's not a Carpenter endorsed version.  They totally screwed up the colors, and the team who put the Divimax version together totally subdued all the colors Carpenter used in the filming of Halloween.  Watching a Carpenter movie without interesting lighting is ridiculous.  So people shouldn't be out there recommending the Divimax version.  This version is for purists and for people who want to watch the film the way it was intended to be watched, not some contemporary, watered down re-imagining of a horror genius' masterpiece.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|It's a testament to the acting talent of Michael C. Hall that, as soon as I began watching the first episode of Dexter, I was able to completely divorce the actor from Six Feet Under's (my favorite show of all time) David Fischer. Dexter, the character and the show, is based on a interesting, albeit slightly unbelievable premise ... what if a child with murderous tendencies could, with the right guidance, grow up to be a useful vigilante?<br /><br />So in the first season of Dexter we meet Dexter Morgan, a blood-splatter expert and boyish neatfreak who lives a secret life as a serial killer. Taught a strict \\"code\\" by his cop father, he will only prey upon victims who are themselves murderers or rapists; usually those who were able to slip through the cracks of the justice system. Although he claims to have no real feelings, Dexter maintains a facade of a normal life, which includes his tomboyish sister and single-mother girlfriend.<br /><br />Besides juggling his double life, Dexter begins receiving messages from another, more ruthless serial killer, dubbed the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\", and over the course of the first season the two form a complex and surprising relationship that causes Dexter to completely re-evaluate his life. It's all smartly written, interesting, sharp, funny, dramatic and highly entertaining.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|The BBC series titled  THE ASCENT OF MAN presented by J. Bronowski gives a lot of information about how scientific thinking and technology developed throughout history and how humankind changed the natural and social environment and adapted to it. Obviously J. Bronowski is an expert on these topics and he has spent a lot of careful effort to prepare these series. His explanations are very careful and no doubt he is very interested in and motivated by these subjects. The careful watcher of these DVD's can learn a lot. However I think these series have several drawbacks :    1. We should not have to watch J. Bronowski close up for 70 % of the time. Although he is a sympathetic man, and although there are many interesting images on the DVD, they consist of only about 30 % of the running time of the DVD. During the remaining 70 % of the time the spectator is obliged to watch J. Bronowski, sometimes close up shots of his face. In a DVD on a subject such as this one the author should be visible only rarely and images of the topics being explained should take up much more of the time. DVDs where seeing the author most of the time is appropriate is for sports DVDs where the sports techniques are demonstrated. But in DVDs on Science the speaker hardly needs to appear on the screen. Otherwise we would feel that we are in a classroom or on a field trip being lectured by a professor. I found this aspect of the DVD boring.    2. Documentary DVDs about scientific topics should use computerised sound and visual effects to make the subject more interesting, to hold the viewer's attention and to entertain while teaching. One of the best ways to teach and to learn is to entertain while giving important information. This DVD lacks this, perhaps because when it was shot in the 1970's computers were not as developed as today. This is another reason why I found such important subjects presented in a little boring way.    3. J. Bronowski talks about many important inventions and discoveries by humankind.  Although the  series is quite long about 663 minutes it is understandable that he can not mention all inventions and discoveries, nor is this necessary. However, I am baffled that he does not mention one important invention that is so crucial in the Ascent  of Man : the invention of writing.    4. He also talks about many important scientists and artists who played important roles in the development of scientific and artistic thinking and achievements. Likewise we can not expect him to talk about everybody. But one man so important in these subjects should not have been left out, he talks about him very briefly towards the end of the program : Leonardo Da Vinci. He and his scientific and artistic works deserve to be talked about much more.    5. The title the Ascent of Man sounds masculine. Although I don't think there is any intended sexual discrimination in this DVD, the female human seems to not exist in the development of humankind. Of course women have made important contributions to the development of humankind so the title should have been the Ascent of  Humans or  a similar title that does not have a connotation of gender.    I have learned a lot from this DVD but would have liked to be entertained at the same time.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking. My only regret is that I do not have a Blu-Ray player to play this on.
B00005R62K|5.0|I discovered Priest shortly after \\"Steel\\" around 1981. I quickly bought their 70's albums and feel this blows Van Halen 1 away. Many who grew up in the 70's and 80's feel VH 1 killed the fuddy duddy 70's rock like Zeppelin and Nugent. Although a few years after the fact, I discovered this album and it blows VH 1 away (also early 78' release) for truly beginning \\"THE METAL MOVEMENT\\" which eventually featured the likes of Metallica till now who I'm sure were influenced by Stained Class. \\"Exciter\\" doesn't sound 1978 at all. Hard to believe that was out almost simultaneously as Saturday Night Fever. Think about it. An album ahead of its time. I was in grade school in 78' and at that time, my mom was shoving Manilow down my throat.LOL. Steel was the first \\"metal\\" album I bought and like I said, I discoved their 70's gems shortly after. This being the best. May not of commercially sold that well, however, any metal purist has to rate this as one of the top 5 metal influential releases of all time. My top 5 in no particular order are Deep Purple \\"Machine Head\\", AC/DC \\"Let there be Rock\\", Priest \\"Stained Class\\", Metallica \\"Kill em' all\\" and G & R \\"Appetite\\".
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is one hellova boys night in movie . All the main leads are great & the twists & turns , music , chases , one liners made me give this 5stars without hesitation .    A special nod to Ray Winstone - you guys over your side of pond won't know much of him but he has rocked in many such 'hard man' roles . Well done Ray on another topnotch turnout especially as you were up against 'Jack' .    But Q - WAS the bad guy who got shot in the stomach & knew Leonardo was the rat , a policeman . If not why didn't he tell the others .....think Mr Brown in Reservoir Dogs lying in a pol of blood here .
B000V1Y43W|5.0|** Spectacular Picture & Sound **    This movie is so well done, it's one of our Favorite Disney/Pixar flicks.    And the picture quality ... right from the opening scene, it just looks amazing. If you want to see how good Blu-Ray can look, get this disc.
0440238609|5.0|Bought them for my children for Christmas. They have already read all of them, and were well pleased with the series.
B000W1V44I|5.0|This is by far one of the best Backstreet Boys albums. This definitley the best CD of 2007 and probably will be the best of 2008. I absolutley love all of the songs. I am so glad that their music was able to mature with them. Sometimes it is hard for artists to mature their music. However, the Backstreet Boys did it, and did it will. The Backstreet Boys are back and better than ever!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|The Last season of Gilmore Girls. Even as i type it it's sad to think that there really won't be anymore episodes. No more Rory and lorelai. No more witty combacks or sassy remarks.   I have seasons one through six and I have watched each of them over one hundred times. The whole series is an emotional rollercoaster. With all of the engagements, the breakups, the pregnancies(spelling?),the marriages and the proposals, you are always left guessing at the end of an episode. This is also how they ended the series. The ending is half happy but at the same time half sad. A couple splits up and a couple gets back together. A town comes together to show their love for one of their own. And there is a fight about bratworst that you can't miss. All-in-all if you don't buy the last season you will regret it. The plot of Gilmore Girls is brilliant and the characters are flawless. But Warning: The end WILL leave you wanting more.
1582701709|1.0|My sister gave me this book for Christmas - I began reading a few days ago and initially was puzzled....WHAT was I missing? It seemed like 'new age' garbage...and I LOVE a lot of 'new age' stuff...but this read like garbage. Initially I was upset - the book was telling me that my negative attitude was the cause of all the incidences of life that give me grief. I put the book away for a few days and tried again to read it with the right 'attitude.' Sorry, this is GARBAGE. If there are readers out there who think they can be thin, rich, get all they want in material goods, etc., by following the principles in this book, I hope you also put 'live forever without aging' on your list so you can prove to the world that the tenents Byrne describes are valid.  Life throws us curves - our task is to make the best of all events so every negative that we can possibly encounter has some positive outcome attached - even if it's only a life-lesson on how to handle a bum day. (I wonder if Ms. Byrne had these strong 'positive attraction' thoughts before birth...that's why she wasn't born into a devastated village in a dirt-poor African country to an AIDS mother with 10 shoeless, unschooled kids and no food.) What my father used to say about my choice of reading material (i.e., Yeats, Robinson, Tennyson, Blake, etc.) has finally come true about a book: THIS is printed toilet paper.
B00104W8T6|5.0|After viewing the movie I ran to the store for the soundtrack, only to find it wasn't being released until 1/8/08. I counted the days. I am a 50+ year old, yet the blend of current artists as well as old (Kinks, Velvet Underground, Mott the Hoople) has just the right feel. If this were a 33rpm (vinyl record) the grooves would be worn out already. What a fabulous sound...exactly reflecting the tone of the movie!
1932100660|5.0|After completing the largest nutrition and health study ever conducted, Dr. Campbell, a professor of Nutritional Biochemistry and life long research scientist prepared to publish his findings and conclusions. His younger son Thomas McIlwain helped him in this endeavor.   Further library research into the history of diet and disease showed that the same conclusions had been reached many times in the past.  The early philosophers didn't have modern scientific methods to prove their contentions so their ideas were carelessly laid aside and according to Professor Campbell this was a great mistake and our present day long list of chronic diseases proves it.  He noted that Plato made predictions about diet and disease that are in accord with his latest research findings.  He also found that his great-great uncle George Macilwain a prominent surgeon in London in the early 1800's published similar information on diet and disease that would hold up in view of present day knowledge.  Dr. Campbell explains the problems encountered by scientists as they set up experiments to determine how foods affect our health and what is the very best diet.  He also explains how misinformation gets into scientific reports and confuses the public. If you are seeking the truth about how the foods you eat effect your health, THIS IS A MUST READ.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|I'm a big fan of sci-fi.... when it's done well.<br /><br />This fiasco was an absolute disaster. Outside of the general story line of trying to re-activate the Sun as it's fizzling out, I couldn't make heads or tails out of this thing.<br /><br />Where did the bad guy/alien/antagonist at the end come from? How did he get on the ship? Two of the many questions no one even bothered to address when they \\"wrote\\" this thing, assuming it wasn't just someone's summer college project. All the suspense of watching grass grow.<br /><br />I will say one thing: it's certainly LOUD!<br /><br />The only reason it gets even one star is that I can't figure out a way to post a review any other way.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Die Hard is keeping with the times! This high - tech Die Hard challenges John's well-known qualities, but he, of course, finds all responses. And naturally, finds them with a help of a partner, who like in Die Hard 3, is reluctant at the beginning, but helpful afterwards. The scene of the final fight, perhaps, ends too fast, but McClane again, in his usual manner demonstrates the imagination, that only a human being may ever have.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I started watching dexter during the second season. I am hooked. I had to buy the first season to catch up. It was well worth it!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|If you're a Neil Young fan, you MUST get this (including the DVD).  It's kind of like \\"unplugged\\" before everyone got into doing it.  His passion for the songs is very evident, and there is nothing but Neil and his instrument (an acoustic guitar and a piano).  No stage show, nobody else on the stage but him.  On this night, his voice was \\"right on\\" and crystal clear.  Incredible performance and the sound quality is excellent, especially considering this was performed 37 years ago.  Buy it and you'll be glad you did.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|Writing, directing, acting, casting, art direction, editing, concept - Nothing appealed to me; everything seemed confused and repetitious and chaotic yet flat.    Sunshine is just one calamity after another answered with panic.   After the first few they all seemed so much the same.
B000002LQD|5.0|If you've read any reviews of this album, or even references to it, here or elsewhere, you've no doubt learned that it's \\"incredibly grim\\" (see Amazon review, above), Lou Reed's darkest album, etc.. If, however, you actually listen to the lyrics all the way through, and see how the songs work together to create a whole, you'll find that it is, in fact, by far the most positive piece in Lou Reed's oevre. Basically, this is an album about working through the darkness, \\"mov[ing] through the fire to the light.\\" Yes, there's lots of misery and ugliness, but it's all pointing toward the \\"life's good\\" refrain in \\"Power & Glory.\\" Then, in case you didn't get it, the final, title track, gives the whole thing in a microcosm, describing in stunning terms a journey through one's personal hell, toward wholeness (\\"when the past makes you laugh and you can savor the magic that let's you survive your own war, you find that that fire is passion, and there's a door up ahead not a wall\\"). Yes, believe it or not, the guy who made the \\"Berlin\\" album and wrote \\"I thought I was someone else, someone good\\" is saying that, yes, you can overcome your personal demons, life is good.
0898159156|5.0|Whether you plan on growing these monsters or not, this is a fun book to read!    Having spent a lifetime maintaining aquariums (saltwater, freshwater and reef) and reading hundreds of \\"how-to\\" books regarding the same, I compliment Peter D'Amato on his ability to instruct and entertain.  Beautiful pictures, clear information, and organized presentation make this book a perfect introduction to carnivorous plants. His enthusiam is obvious and infectious! I also loved the movie references.    These plants are the coolest!  I can't wait to start my own blood-thirsty garden.
B0007OASII|5.0|There is a reason that this album gets mostly 5-star reviews.    First off all, you have to listen to this awesome music on a Zune or some other device that will output high quality sound so you can pickup the nuances of the magical musical orchestration of the amazing compilation that is \\"The Black Halo\\".     For those that don't own the CD or the entire album and just want to download a few of the MP3, here is my review of each song.    I'm going to leave out the interludes because I don't think they add much to the music.  Sorry.    March of Mephisto 5:29 *****  an awesome, stomping, battle-march sort of song.    Don't know how anyone could not like it.    First on play-list.    When The Lights Are Down 3:41 ****  a real catchy chorus.    Made my Kamelot play-list easily.   Sizzling solo at 2:45.    The Haunting (Somewhere In Time) - 5:40   This one did not make my play list initially.    The chorus is good. Verses marginal.    Radio edit version is better.    Soul Society 4:17  Can pretty much be summed up as The Haunting.    Catchy chorus, but verses nothing special.  At 2:56 it gets interesting from about 20 seconds.    Abandoned 4:07  Nice piano entry.    It's pretty non-eventful until 2:48.    Nice finish.    This Pain 3:59 *****  Great song! 5-stars.    Lots of changes and all blend nicely.    Definitely on the play-list.  3:25 is awesome shift.    Moonlight 5:10 *****  Another awesome song!    Starts off slowly (but not badly), but at 1:15 it kicks in.    Great chorus.  Play-list, yes!    The Black Halo 3:43  This did not make my play-list initially.    Nice solo at 2:40.  Makes song worthwhile.   3-stars perhaps.    Nothing Ever Dies 4:45  Also did not make initial play-list.   Nice tempo change at 2:08, but... does it save the song?  Perhaps.    Memento Mori 8:54 ******  I LOVE this song... my favorite on the album.  starting at 1:24 it gets great and just keeps evolving.    A real master piece!!!    Serenade 4:33  Not one of the better songs.  It didn'timpress me.    Not bad at 3:10 and 3:56, but not making the play-list.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|As I stated in my [[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] review....QUIT WHINING! I know it's not like it was in theatres! There is, however, more stuff to the DVD than in theatres...unless you saw the Standalone DP... Also it was rumored that the double feature will be out on DVD anyway! As for the people that are bagging on it just because they don't like THIS particular segment of Grindhouse....Well, you my friends are just plain ol' blind. You say that you like other Tarantino films, but then turn right around and stab the man in the back by completely hating this film! How can you say it is boring? I know that the talking sequences are a little drawn out, but what Tarantino film doesn't have those moments?  Jeez people....just jeez...
1572815612|1.0|Just received the standardsized Universal Waite (Isbn 1572815612, blue box with a spreadsheet). Compared to the beautiful pocketversion the printing is a catastrophy. The vibrant colours are gone, fx the Hermit is no longer standing in the dark of night but in the early gloom of the morning. Now I don't mind a certain paleness. But please, there is absolutely no focus whatsoever in the cards. It looks like a really bad scan to me, with all details gone. Even the copyright (2004) is blurred! Did I get a bad copy or is this the standard of the US games printing?
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return once again in this third installment of the Spiderman series.    Maguire revives his role as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  Peter's life is going very well; he's doing well in school and his relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) couldn't be better.  Plus, he's just saved the police chief's daughter from certain death.  Now, he's being awarded the key to the city.  Life couldn't be much better, right?  Wrong!    Harry Osborne (Franco) still blames Spiderman for the death of his father.  So, Harry's taken on a persona of his own as the New Goblin.  He and Spiderman fight it out over New York, but Spiderman managed to knock Harry off of his futuristic surfboard.  Harry ends up in the hospital with a loss of memory.  For the moment, Harry doesn't remember anything of his encounter with Spiderman, and he and Peter become friends again (or so it seems).    Peter learns more about the death of his uncle.  He finds out that the man who was arrested for the killing was not the killer at all.  The real killer turns out to be Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church).  He escapes from prison and flees from the police, but something happens to him as he's fleeing.  He runs into some sort of physics lab where his bodily chemistry is altered.  He can now assume shapes in the sand and turns once again to crime.  He and Spiderman have several run-ins, and he's given the name Sandman.    Peter is also going through changes of his own.  Some symbiotic being has attached itself to Peter's Spiderman suit.  It gives him a new sense of strength and power, but it also takes its toll on Peter mentally.  He's become stronger, but he's also become more abrasive and brash.  Mary Jane has noticed the change in Peter, and she's feeling more distanced from him.  Mary Jane decides to visit Harry, and they share a kiss.  Mary Jane runs from the house, but the kiss has triggered Harry's memory.  He again goes searching for Spiderman.  The two fight it out, andSpiderman leaves Harry for dead.    Another enemy for Spiderman emerges in this film.  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is a new reporter selling pictures to Peter's newspaper.  J.J. Jameson likes Eddie's pictures better than Peter's and tells Eddie if he can find a picture of Spiderman \\"with his hands in the cookie jar\\", he'll get the open reporter position on the paper.  Eddie submits a picture to J.J. of Spiderman holding a bag of money in front of a bank, and J.J. gives him the job.  Peter finds out and claims that the picture is a fake.  The paper finds out that the picture is indeed a fake, and Eddie is fired.  He vows revenge against Peter.  Eddie goes to church and hears noises from the bell tower.  The noise is Peter trying to rid himself of the symbiote.  The symbiote falls on Eddie and soon, he has transformed into Venom; a villian intent on destroying Spiderman.    Soon, Sandman and Venom have teamed up in an effort to destroy Spiderman.  Eddie has captured Mary Jane and placed her 80 stories above the ground inside a taxi cab.  Peter sees the events unfolding on television and goes to help.  He first stops at Harry's house to ask for his help, but Harry doesn't give in (by this time, Harry's butler has told him the truth about his father's death).  So, Spiderman goes off to fight the two  villains alone.  Will Mary Jane survive?  Will Harry come to help Spiderman?    I thought this was the best of the Spiderman movies so far.  The acting is great and its always nice to have the same actors continue with their roles in sequels.  There is a lot of action and characters to keep track of in this movie, but everything is tied up at the end.  The ending leaves the door wide open for a fourth installment, which I'm sure will be coming soon.    I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and see if Spiderman can defeat the new villians as well as the enemy within himself.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|Because this movie was an abomination from start to finish. It is some futuristic space race to save the earth/universe (Haven't we already seen a billion of these types of movies over the years??) by attempting to save the sun.... Of course, something goes wrong.... Doesn't it always in these kinds of films??? And it is always the same type of thing that goes wrong-- BORING!!    I stopped actively watching this film and just let my husband watch it while I read the newspaper instead, as this movie was the same old predictable format I've seen in so many other films on the same theme. Come up with some sort of new gimmick to grab my attention and I'll gladly watch.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|I am not rating the movie because I cannot view the blu-ray disc I bought. The disc will not play on many blu-ray players because it contains copyright protection that is so new that some players can't read it. This is a clear case of greedy studios releasing product before the technology is ready to support it.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Excellent. Didn't think it would be as good as it turned out to be. Heard about it on the radio and figured I would give it a shot.   Plot got a little thin in some spots. Very few though.  Highly recommend to people that like a smartly written show with a dark sense of humor.     I'll be buying season two.  This is based on the first season. Will do another review after seeing all of season two.
071563318X|1.0|I bought this book based on the  reader reviews, however this book fell short of even my lowest expectations. Most of the book is filled with dry content like \\"Chainsaw- A heavy weapon effective at cutting through attacking zombies, but limited by it's range and weight.\\" Following this would be an entry of another item with the same sort of  superficial description. The illustrations are meant to be humorous, and admittedly some are, but most aren't worth paying attention to. There's limited variation in the style of humor employed throughout the book, so punchlines quickly become a chore to get through.<br /><br />If I wanted to introduce my friends to the zombie genre, this definitely would not be the book.  It in no way made the zombie world come alive in any sort of imaginative way. Shame on you Max Brooks.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This is one of the most remarkable films I've viewed in quite some time.  While I admit to a love of fantasy, I like this film for more than just its fairy-tale/dream aspects. The imaginative and creative visuals, coupled with a symbiotic script, prod one into delving into one's own mental and emotional wellspring to make the synaptic link that fleshes out the plot. Unlike other reviewers, who complain that the visuals are stunning but the plot weak, I feel that the story and the visuals cannot be separated, (Neil Gaiman's graphic novel background is evident in this respect) but combine to create a rich and unique vision of a timeless issue - adolescent rebellion vs love of family - the difficult transition period from child to adult.<br /><br />The film requires the viewer to think and use both story and visuals together, to fill in the unspoken details relayed through the visuals and soundtrack.  Example - the void of the Dark Queen's eyes - inpenetrable \\"windows of the soul\\", the antithesis of \\"mirrors\\" - Looking into such eyes, one does not see a reflection of joy, life, or love - only a black, empty, and souless void.  Other such visual devices and metaphors (such as the mechanical dolls singing \\"Close to You\\" as they transform Helena into a doll-like copy of her anti-mother) flesh out the relationships between the characters,  for those who look beyond the surface of the fantastic visuals and take the time to make the connections.  Not a film to be viewed once and dismissed, I have viewed this film four times now, (I bought the DVD after the first viewing) and find new depth and entertainment each time I view it.
0451196716|5.0|I agree with the review that said this would make a great movie. Yes, it has the potential to be a great movie...in the right hands. But, alas, I'm doubtful that in this climate of (pinching my nose) political correctness, and over-budgeted productions, demographics and whatnot, there are many filmmakers with the balls to tell this story as it's told in the book: raw, shamelessly graphic, and unabashedly honest. William Friedkin is one of extremely few that come to mind.<br /><br />Even if the film gets an X rating, it should remain faithful to the book. Besides, the controversy would only attract crowds, not detract.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I say the broth is quite alright and ready to be served. This is my favorite of the three. Why...because of the issues faced by both hero and villain alike ...it almost makes them seem like real people. The bad spidey was something else.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|Most people knew the story and how it would end but it's never been more saddening as we've never been made to care for Kong so much. Personally, I love animals and it tears me apart when I see or hear of them being abused (Michael Vick, you deserve your punishment, if not more). So knowing the tragic fate of King Kong actually kept me from seeing it in the theater. That was probably still a good choice as the end really pulls at my heart strings. Don't get me wrong though, I really like this film and it's obviously really well done if it can make me feel so much for an animated, oversized gorilla.<br /><br />I won't bother with the plot as most everyone knows it by now. I'll focus on the HD DVD disc which is why your probably reading these reviews anyway. Too many review the movie and never speak of the disc quality, which I know bugs me a little.<br /><br />The video is breathtaking, especially once the characters arrive on the island. The jungle scenes are truly alive and really pop in the way you hope a new hi def disc will. The graphics and animation by WETA (who also did Lord of the Rings) are top notch. They blend almost perfectly with the scenery and the details allow you to really look at them and appreciate how good they really are. You can tell they're graphics but it doesn't hurt the enjoyment or believability at all. My favorite things to look at are Kong as you can inspect every hair, scar, and skin texture in their amazing detail. And during the attack in the insect pit. These tube like creatures reveal this wet, slick, fleshy looking texture to them. I never stop being amazed by how real that looks.<br /><br />Audio wise, we get a very robust Dolby Digital Plus mix. This disc packs a wallop that'll knock you across the room during the action parts. The dialog and score are perfectly balanced and sound great too, but I always look forward to the action bits and this one is everything you could hope for. I found new demo material here with the Kong/T-Rex fight. Not only a sight to behold but a sonic wonder for the ears. The audio puts all the growls, roars, thumps and crashes right in your house(given you have a home theater of course). It's truly relentless and exhiliarating to the point of exhaustion by the time it's finished. Great stuff.<br /><br />This is one of the first films you need to get for your HD DVD player. If you don't have home theater, this movie will inspire you to consider it as it's as much a sonic marvel as a visual wonder. And all of this is only bested by a wonderful story and excellent acting. The audio and video must come second to these but it's all the better to have them all here. Overall, this is a wonderful film and is what I believe to be the best adaptation of King Kong ever. The question is, knowing the outcome, can you make it to the end?ht to behold but a sonic wonder for the ears.

038572179X|3.0|The movie has done so well that I had to read the book it was based on to see what I was missing. After what I felt was a slow start, the book picked up, only to be followed by a graphic description of British soldiers in northern France during World War II. I kept pushing on hoping that the ending of the story would make it all worth it. After finishing the book, I'm not sure that it did.<br /><br />In short, the story follows a young and imaginative girl whose false accusations against her sister's lover lead her to a life of remorse. The book takes part in four stages and spans from 1935 to the end of the last decade. The author undoubtedly writes well, thereby raising the reading experience of a somewhat boring novel. All in all, it was an interesting story written as best as it probably could have been. I'm just not sure it lives up to all of the hype.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is the best nature documentary that I have ever seen.  I purchased Planet Earth at first to test my new HD system, and I did not anticipate that I would be so hooked on watching it over and over again.  I have shown episodes to several friends and family members and they have all been thrilled by it.  The shots in the series are unbelievable.  I have never seen anything like it.  I would highly recommend this series for anyone with an HD system.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Season 1 of Veronica Mars is the best of all three seasons.  Other reviews have covered the reasons why this is such a fun show to watch, including excellent acting, an engaging mix of empathetic and ridiculous characters, exploration of various social and demographic tensions, mortifying teenage experiences that put our own petty embarrassments into perspective, cleverly twisted crime solving, and the satisfaction of seeing a mere teenage girl serve up some justice for the underprivileged.  Unfortunately, the series took a nosedive in Season 3, wherein many favorite characters are either underdeveloped or are reduced to cardboard cutouts of their formerly interesting selves.  Good that it was canceled before more damage could be done.
1921145579|5.0|A story set on a tropical island which sounds idyllic until the fighting begins. As a civil war erupts around them the children of one village escape to nineteenth century London as they are introduced to \\"Mr Dickens\\" and the story of Pip through Mr Watts (or 'Popeye' as they were used to calling him before he became their teacher).<br /><br />I found it a really enjoyable read. The wisdom of not only Mr Watts but of the parents of the children who are invited into class to share their knowledge, which is more often than not based on an observation of nature.<br /><br />For all it's simplistic teachings it's also a comparison by Matilda, a young girl from the village, between her life and Pip's as she grows into adulthood.<br />I was genuinely shocked by what happened toward the end of the book but as horrific as it was it still had me gripped and I really felt like I'd read a good story by the end.
0446677450|5.0|It's very amusing reading some of the negative reviews about RICH DAD POOR DAD by Robert Kiyosaki. Of course everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I believe most who have attacked this book did not understand what the book was even about.<br /><br />This book is not a road map to investing, it is a basic outline. If you're looking for minute details, there are certainly better sources available. It seems some folks are looking for a detailed formula. Do this, then do that, followed by this other thing and viola! You're rich! Sorry, but that's not what this book is all about and quite frankly, there is no secret formula that is going to work the same for everyone. If there was, everyone would be wealthy.<br /><br />Here is what this book WILL do for most people, which is exactly what I believe Kiyosaki intended. Rich Dad Poor Dad will change the way you think about money. I don't know how to say it any more simply than that.<br /><br />The book is very well written and easy to read and understand. Some may think it a bit dated as it was originally printed in 1997, but the same principles about making money and generating cash flow remain constant.<br /><br />For anyone just getting starting on building their financial resources, I believe this is one of the cornerstones on which to build. This book will put your mind in gear and get you thinking about endless possibilities. What you do with those possibilities is up to you.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I bought one to replace my aging Seiko, and love it. Good ol' Seiko Chronograph in the middle, and the bezel does regular non-flying multiplication and division in addition to the airplane-related calculations, though you wouldn't know it from reading the instructions. Here's how:    Turn the outer ring so that the number you want to multiply is opposite the 10 on the inner ring, and then find the number you're multiplying by on the inner ring and read the product from the outer ring opposite that.    Division is the reverse of multiplication -- line up the dividend on the outside ring with the divisor on the inside, and read the quotient opposite the inner 10.
0307277887|4.0|This is an excellent book, the plot flows smoothly, I would definitely recommend it to my friends.  The only complaint I have is that the writing style is very informal, sophomorically written to the point that at times it can be difficult to follow.
B0011NVC98|5.0|\\"Beowulf\\" is the most ambitious and awe-inspiring fantasy film to emerge in the considerable wake of [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy]] -barring [[ASIN:B00005JPLW 300]] which isn't entirely fantasy. It's a very adult animated movie that pushes the PG-13 rating to it's breaking point with overt sexual references, brutal violence, and abundant nudity. It is also the most impressive bit of computer animation I've ever had the pleasure of viewing and hopefully you didn't miss it on the big screen.<br /><br />\\"Beowulf\\" is, of course, based on the poem of the same name and has been filmed several times before, most recently with Gerard Butler in the lead role in [[ASIN:B000GIXEIG Beowulf & Grendel]]. Like so many modern film interpretations of classic myths, that film minimized the supernatural fantasy aspects and tried to make the story more realistic (see: boring). This adaptation will have none of that as we are treated to an etheral she-demon, toothy sea monsters, an utterly grotesque troll, and the most impressive dragon since [[ASIN:B0000AUHOM Dragonslayer]] over two decades ago. Along with animation that often leaves you gaping in awe at the film's beauty and the extreme onscreen carnage, there is little for me not to love about this adaption.<br /><br />The performances are well done all around. The CG was animated over the actions of onscreen actors including Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and Anthony Hopkins. While a bit is certainly lost in the translation with a few characters' faces seeming rather stiff at times, the end result is more than a little bit impressive.  So many films mix CG and live action nowadays that viewers have had to learn to ignore the obvious line between the two, but in making this an entirely CG affair, the look remains seamless throughout and it's easier to get lost in the first rate action sequences.  The only thing really lacking storywise is emotional depth in the love story between Beowulf and his queen. But that is a tiny complaint in an ocean of awesome.<br /><br />The story is a suprisingly emotional spin on the stone classic which pits the heroic-yet-fallible warrior, Beowulf, against monsters that are products of -if not representations of- human weakness. The monster Grendel is a wretched and pitiful creature whose eardrums are outside of his head, making the sounds of the villagers' merrymaking painful and driving him berserk. King Hrothgar puts out a reward which Beowulf arrives to collect and as the plot thickens the classic story receives a new perspective that drives the drama to a new, rather ironic level. The end result is a nicely foreshadowed sequence of events that leads to Beowulf being crowned as king. But just as each of the beasts the hero faces have a vital weakness so does he, and the day of reckoning for his dalliances does come.<br /><br /> The music is as epic and memorable as the story itself and the visuals -as stated and restated- are top notch.  The new spin on the old story gives a fresh perspective on a literary classic, as though the poem is but a third-person recounting of the events we witness in the film passed down and altered by time.  Clever.  I'd love to see more classic mythological stories get this kind of treatment.  The director's cut DVD features some extra gore and that's about it, but it's good enough for me to recommend that version.  It also comes with a small comic book, some interesting \\"making of\\" stuff, and some other typical bonus materials, mostly dealing with casting and story conception.  The production art that's shown is very cool and the trailer for \\"Iron Man \\" is on there too.  Nothing earth-shattering, but certainly adequate.<br /><br />Animation should not be just for kids, and neither should this film genre.  This is the sort of film that shows just how far CG has come in such a short time.  I can't wait to see what animation will look like a decade form now. How \\"Beowulf\\" got away without an \\"R\\" rating in the theaters is a mystery to me, but I'm just thrilled that it slipped through because I wouldn't change a thing. Except for maybe the fist-sized dragon heart; that was just silly. Check this out if you profess any sort of interest in fnatasy or animation.stery to me, but I'm just thrilled that it slipped through because I wouldn't change a thing.

0345350499|3.0|I love the feminist aproach to this story, as well as the numerous mythological/historical portraitures peppered throughout the book.<br />Generally I am attracted to longer books so I can really sink my teeth into the story.  However, in the case of Mists of Avalon, the story just wouldn't end.  This book is so dense, the story telling so fastidious, that the overall reading experience really loses its luster.<br />If you are passionately interested in Arthurian legend, this is a great book.  If you're an avid reader with a taste for historical fiction, this is a good book.  If you're simply browsing for a nice read, keep looking.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Loved everything about the movie... the story, the music, and the actors were great.  For me, it was such \\"feel good\\" movie that I floated out of the theater on a psychedelic cloud.   I bought the cd and I will definitely buy the dvd.

B000002G8H|5.0|There are artists who simply are the genre. Eric Clapton is one of those artists. In other venues I have read some pretty stinging comments about him, his morality, his abilities and so on.

He carries it all the way from We're Going Wrong on Disraeli Gears to We're All The Way to Steady Rollin' Man.<br /><br />This fella does the Blues. Others do too but Eric Clapton DOES THE BLUES and Slowhand is one of his best.
0142000671|4.0|This may be the most rambly review here, but what I can say that I enjoyed this story.  The title is borrowed from Robert Burns' most famous poem \\"To A Mouse\\", and has been alluded to so often in modern culture that it has completely become its own cliche.  However, the novel uses this title for a good reason as it tells a story of two people, Lennie and George, who like the poem find that their hopes and dreams will never be realized due to their unforeseen but inevitable future reality.  It is very much ahead of its time in depicting laborers at the absolute end of their rope, basically blowing through jobs so much so that they are stuck forever in neutral.  If you think about it each character has his own crutch that stunts any growth and which makes each day feel the same, reminding me of Brick's literal crutch later depicted in \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\".  For example George's crutch is Lenny, a man he so understands and yet so abhors that he goes into each job knowing Lenny's Tourette's like tics and tendencies to clutch things too hard will likely lead to early termination or worse, yet still knows that having Lenny around definitely beats being a nomad alone.  Old Man Candy's crutch is old age, as he is someone whom is so disfigured and far gone that even the ownership of his dog is relinquished from him.  After you think long and hard about each character, you understand why Steinbeck makes frequent references to animals, because symbolically that IS what all the main characters are to a large extent.      The depth of the characters are all fantastic for such a short story, which is amazing when you consider that there are only six chapters and six jumps of scenery/time.  In many ways I think that is why a short story like this is more marketable as a book to teach in school than \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" which tells a more sweeping epic about a famous epoch in history.  \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is easy to imagine, easy to understand contextually, and most importantly deepenough to require speculation about the true underpinnings of the dialogue and the behavior displayed.  The dream that Lennie and George had of living of the land was to them almost like a daily vitamin that would get them through it.  It would help Lenny believe in a better life, and it would help George feel better about himself for at least offering Lenny moments of peace dreaming about rabbits.  I guess I'm different in that I feel that George made up this story and never believes in it ever, ever, EVER coming to fruition until old Candy eavesdrops and offers monetary backing to the dream.  George almost uses the story to manipulate Lennie to stay with him and trust him, and in that way I see more ambivalence in his character than most.      Of course it is a tragedy, as Lennie relapses thrice (Curley's hand, Slim's pup, and Curley's wife) into what I can only describe as aggressive acts of non-malice.  It seems that things that he likes he cares dearly for, he clutches too hard and in order to quiet down their pain from George he increases his vice grips to disfigure what he touches. After his last fatal encounter with Curly's sad wife, Lennie knows he did something wrong again and hides in the spot George tells him to, and has hallucinatory dreams condemning himself for negligence.  Luckily he finds George and they both have a deja vu type moment of blissful ignorance before George does what is expected of him, which is to kill him for killing Curley's wife.    I guess Steinbeck's main point is to tell us to loook closer before making judgments on a person's character.  If given a more isolated point of view, Lennie's character is vulgar and reprehensible.  However, his behavior is a result not of personality but of psychological and mental retardation.  Much like Candy's dog, who is innocently shot, Lennie is innocently shot because during the time period was a lot less acceptability to the mentally unstable.  There simply wasn't enough of an objective back in the '30s to look deeper the inner thinkings of the retarded and regard acts of aggression as more than simple malice.  George understands this, which is partly why he is morose all the time in defending Lennie.   I also believe that Steinbeck makes sure to give George and Lennie a backstory to prove that George's intentions were mainly good, and that at the end George was giving Lennie as much mercy as possible without turning himself in as a murderer's accomplice.  Very interesting for as little pages as it was.
0385522401|5.0|This relatively short novel has essentially two characters, a young man and woman who spend their wedding night at a hotel at Chesil Beach in Britain. Their story probably reflects, in one degree or another, the experiences of thousands of people of their age who came to adulthood in a time when so-called sexual liberation (can we ever be really liberated from our primal selves?) was still over the horizon.    The author does a masterful job of portraying the thoughts and emotions of these two people as they try to navigate what for them becomes an unnavigable passage to married life.     Neither of these characters is particularly lovable. I found the husband less likable than his bride. Both were immature and unprepared for giving and taking virginity. Neither had the emotional or mental tools to take care of the other.     I suspect most readers who came of age in this period can relate uneasily to parts of this tale. While the story is not particularly uplifting, it is thoughtfully and skillfully told by Ian McEwan.     If you're looking for light fluff reading, this isn't it. If you're looking for something that will make you think about relationships, this could be for you.     For me, the book underscores the distinct difference between giving and receiving between lovers. Neither character in this book could get the giving part even remotely right, and as a consequence neither one of them could get the receiving part right either.     This book reinforces my own view that a top-notch relationship is one in which it becomes impossible to tell where the giving stops and the receiving begins; they become one and the same. If you read this book through that prism, you'll see how and when the romance flopped.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|I am sorry to those fans of Danny Boyle, but this movie was horrible.  For the first two thirds of this movie I was bored to tears and left wondering how such stupid people could have been chosen to save the world.  Some of the decisions that were made and the mistakes that were made by these characters seemed ridiculous for individuals of their supposed intelligence.  The worst part of this movie came in the last quarter when all of a sudden it changed from a boring science fiction film into a Freddy Krueger slasher film.  I spent the last part of this film in utter amazement as to the schizophrenic path it had taken.    Also, I was shocked at the lack of scientific believability.  So many things happened in this film that defied all scientific logic.  It made one wonder if the writer, director and/or producers had ever taken a Jr. High science class.  Honestly, this had to be one of the most boring and unrealistic films I have had the displeasure of seeing.  This coming from a person who absolutely loves Science Fiction books and movies.  My suggestion is that Danny Boyle stay out of the Sci Fi Genre and leave that to people who know what they are doing.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. I always enjoy a well done animated feature, expecially from the Pixar studios. However this is one that left me astounded. Everything, from the animation, story line, cast, music, sound, is top notch. You will not be disappointed with this amazing DVD.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|however if you want something that is more intimate then check out Once. The acting isn't great, the music isn't even perfect and there are more directing problems than I can mention. That made up the charm of this movie though. I felt like I was watching a home movie made to show a moment in time of \\"guy\\" and \\"girls'\\" lives. They were real and with our hyper-entertainment real is boring for most but if you keep watching you will be drawn in. I loved the way that guy sang better at the end of the movie than at the beginning, girl inspired him and motivated him. That's what good relationships do, they make us better. The ending is not fairy-tale but I am so happy that they kept it a good moral ending, so unlike Hollywood where lust and passion nearly always takes over. I was left feeling rather melancholy, the music is haunting and stays with you.
B00005JKG9|4.0|Real Estate, as practiced by the folks at Premiere Properties (a fictional company where the characters in this film work, any resemblance to an actual company is purely coincidental), is salesmanship, yes, but perhaps a bit more akin to a con game, or, let's face it, outright fraud. Times are tough, and Mitch and Murray downtown send motivational speaker Blake (Alec Baldwin) down to \\"motivate\\" the sales force. First prize, a Cadillac, second, a set of steak knives. Third prize is, to quote Donald Trump, \\"You're Fired.\\" Blake gives quite a talk, in a part that was written especially for Baldwin, and added to the play version for the film by playwright and screenwriter David Mamet. Though it is just a short segment near the beginning, it really sets the tone for the rest of the film, and also lays out the sales philosophy that Mitch and Murray expect them to follow. The sales game's ABCs are simple. A.B.C. stands for Always Be Closing. The only thing that matters is getting them to sign on the line that is dotted . . . Blake comes on very brash and bold. Bragging about the car he drives, flaunting the expensive watch he wears that costs more than the car Dave Moss (Ed Harris) drives. He swaggers and bullies his way through his bit. At one point he says Real Estate takes balls of brass, and then produces a pair as a visual aid. Backed up in this presentation by officious office manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey) he claims that Mitch and Murray have purchased a set of leads from the Glen Garry Glenross tract that are sales gold. Williamson flashes a set of index cards as if they are the Holy Grail.<br /><br />But there is a Catch (you could almost say it was a Catch 22, especially since Alan Arkin is also in the film): They have to use the crumby leads to make sales before they will even be given any of the Glen Garry Glenross leads. Those leads are for closers only. And if they don't close on the bad leads, they will be fired.<br /><br />The film is ostensibly about Real Estate, salesmanship, what have you, but it is really about the ethical and moral breakdown of our society, in the post-Watergate, Reagan era. Shelly (The Machine) Levene, as played by Jack Lemmon, is a once great salesman who has lost his knack. Lemmon attacked his role with youthful enthusiasm remarkable in a man who had such a distinguished career as an actor. He also was determined that you wouldn't feel sympathy for his character. It is hard not to empathize with Lemmon, who has that Everyman quality, and was in a desperate situation, but Lemmon tried his best to discourage the audience from letting Shelly (The Machine) Levene off the hook. He is shown trying to help out his daughter, who is in the hospital, and has even had her phone privileges taken away because her payments are in arrears, but that doesn't justify or excuse his behavior, trying to make a sale no matter what lies he must tell. He kind of has a carny mentality, like the general public who he is trying to sell to are nothing but a bunch of marks, there to be taken advantage of. When he sees top salesman Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) in a jam, trying to evade a customer with buyer's remorse, he steps right into the role Roma has created for him, as another customer who requires Roma to fly out of town to attend a family reunion.<br /><br />But it is Williamson (Kevin Spacey) who, scorned for his lack of ever making a sale himself, and thus, excluding him from the fraternity of salesmen, who blunders, telling the remorseful customer that the check had indeed been cashed, that starts the mandatory 3-day limit for the buyer to cancel the deal clock ticking. So, when Levene berates him for speaking out of turn, he tells him to never pitch in if you don't know what the \\"shot\\" is, because instead of helping him, you could undermine him.<br /><br />Anywhat, you get the gist of the sort of drama this is, and to see just what comes of this tangle you'll have to watch for yourselves. Suffice it to say that they draw parallels with Salesmanship and acting, and the acting is all top-notch, and the screenplay gives them all a terrific opportunity to display their acting chops. All are excellent, but Lemmon and Pacino stand out amongst them. Pacino shows off the thespian skills that clinched him the Oscar for Scent of a Woman.<br /><br />Alec Baldwin gives a short but powerful turn as a brutal motivational speaker. Alan Arkin and Ed Harris are other salesmen at Premiere Properties. They both give excellent support. Arkin has a long career, with one of his most memorable roles the aforementioned Catch 22, a term that has entered the lexicon. He recently won the Oscar for his supporting role as the foul mouthed but kindly junkie grandpa in Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />In some bonus feature material, Arkin reveals that writer David Mamet had all dialogue scripted, even down to the ums and uhs. Plus there was a dialogue coach on the set, and if you only stuttered twice, but the script said three times, they called you on it and made you re-shoot. Arkin said that it was hard, because you had to have an idea for each uh, what you were trying to say for each, sub vocal pause, as they used to call them in speech class. It is a testament to the acting skill that it was so heavily scripted, yet the words flowed with all the spontaneity of real life. And it is a testament to the writing that although it was so scripted, it seemed so tangible.<br /><br />Ed Harris played Dave Moss, an agent who was so angry it is hard to imagine how he sold anything. Harris was in The Right Stuff, playing astronaut John Glen, and also portrayed painter Jackson Pollack--and was the lead in Walker, directed by Alex Cox.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was great as Williamson, the office manager who was only doing his job. He is also an Oscar winner for American Beauty, which by the way, also has a rather harsh take on the profession of Real Estate Agent. My favorite Spacey performance (aside from when he cried about all the insinuendos people made just because he took his mother as his date to the Oscars) is in Hurly Burly with Sean Penn. I like that one, because it shows how sleazy Hollywood types are, as opposed to Real Estate Agents. They get enough grief from Mitch and Murray.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0780626117 Hurlyburly (New Line Platinum Series)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003CWL6 American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000ANVPSS Save the Tiger]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000EYV6U Days of Wine and Roses]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003CX8V The Apartment]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005A06N Some Like It Hot]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0783226845 Scent of a Woman]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005ASGC Catch-22]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000BU5U40 Death of a Salesman]]anship and acting, and the acting is all top-notch, and the screenplay gives them all a terrific opportunity to display their acting chops.

B000W04S6U|5.0|Every several years a score comes along that goes beyond anything you could of imagined, a score with such thematic beauty, deep action and wonderful storytelling that you can't believe it exists... Halo 3 is such a score. I loved the first Halo score, although (being a film score buff) I was a bit underwhelmed by the midi instruments. This is one of the first problems Halo 3 fixes by using a completely organing orchestra. Another one of the highpoints of the Halo 3 score is the sheer musical genius put into it, while the first score relied heavily on guitar and techno sound effects, Halo 3 effectively blends techno with orchestra to create musical hybrid fusion (succeeding in so many ways.) So I guess you could say that Halo 3 not only transcends all other video game scores, but it trasends half of the film scores released this year. Game music has a new milestone people... it's Halo 3.
B00005JLPK|4.0|The movie provides a lot of reliable details on Frida's life.  However, some aspects (such as her sexuality) are a bit too dramatic and deceiving.  The best part of this movie is how the director managed to incorporate her paintings into the scene shots so they commanded respect.
0321525655|5.0|The evolving interconnectedness of our social and business communities relies heavily on our ability to communicate with one another. As some communication has become more ephemeral (email, IM), others have become slightly more formal (presentations), involving a larger and often diverse audience.    Garr Reynolds has produced and incredibly beautiful book highlighting the virtues of a zen aesthetic as it applies to communication, and more specifically, presentations.    This book brings a sense of mindfulness to the \\"art\\" of presenting, which covers the multiple stages of presentation from idea to stage. Reading it once was a joy, but I'm sure that I'll be reaching for this book as a source of inspiration and reference when embarking on a presentation of any kind.    This book is a true gem, highly recommended.
B000URDEB0|4.0|Two crucial cornerstones of any band are musicianship (and general song quality), and the lead vocals.  NW had always been very strong in both areas with some of the best songwriting in metal synergizing with Tarja's amazing operatic voice, combining to produce a truly unique and ultra-talented sound, cementing themselves as the reigning female-fronted metal band.    After their lead singer changing-of-the-guard I would have to say that NW's latest offering is still strong as to its songwriting but notably weaker in the other category.    That's not to say DPP isn't good- this is a strong album.  Its hauntingly gothic opening track builds momentum into a pounding orchestral masterpiece with heavy riffs- if this doesn't get your pulse racing and head banging, nothing will!  Amaranth, 7 Days to the Wolves, Sahara, and Bye Bye Beautiful also are great songs with a lot of replayability.  The production was apparently expensive but worth it; it's excellent and the orchestral accompaniment makes for a rich, diverse sound.  Their musicianship is IMO better than ever.    Tarja's replacement Anette is a talented singer in her own right, but she lacks the depth that Tarja had- not only depth of tone, but depth of *emotion*, along with the incredibly skilled operatic talent, phrasing and vibrato that truly put Nightwish on the map as a gothic metal phenomenon.  The quality of vocals is extremely important; I can't just overlook this aspect and am baffled that the band chose her since compared to Tarja (and for that matter, most opera-trained female singers anywhere close to her level, some of whom *must* have auditioned for her spot), Anette's voice is very... plain (speaking of vocal quality, not her talent per se).  She lacks Tarja's majestic sound and vocal range.  Going to see them perform live in Chicago in October '07, it seems Anette couldn't reach the high notes on Wishmaster; still, she had great energy and sang her heart out but she's nowhere near the league of her predecessor and as many people have already pointed out, now they're less distinguishable from other female-fronted bands.    Musically this album is excellent but vocally not as inspiring as it would or could have been with a comparable lead singer.  Nightish has no doubt some of the most rabid, enthusiastic followers in metal fandom and myself and many others will continue to be supportive despite the change in direction.
B000Y7U98W|3.0|Another reviewer provides perhaps an overly descriptive hint of what my wife and I also found to be a problem with this movie.  It starts out as a very interesting science fiction story, then veers into a direction I really wish it would have avoided.  Almost too smart, and trying too hard not to be predictable it instead became predictable and turned what might have been a 4 or 5 star movie into 3 stars instead.<br /><br />It is one of the first Blu-ray disc titles to make use of Profile 1.1 features including Picture-in-Picture commentary and behind the scenes extras.  In that regard it works fairly well.  For those without Profile 1.1 players, you can see the same extras in a non-PiP mode instead.<br /><br />I wish the film was better and had taken a different approach for the last 1/3 (give or take) of the movie.  No, I'm not looking for Armageddon, or a host of other similar movies, but I hoped for better than what this movie turned into.<br /><br />This one seems destined to be a middle of road sci-fi tale, one that some people will absolutely love while others hate it.  I enjoyed a lot of the film, but found myself unhappy with the last portion of it and have graded down because of it.
B00008OWZC|3.0|This is a good triple disc set of live Zeppelin to be sure. Maybe it is my comfort level with TSRTS that makes it hard for me to vote this higher, I don't know. There is much that is very similar, especially Dazed and Confused and parts of Whole Lotta Love although both of those are not as pleasing to me as TSRTS versions.<br />The big pay-off for me is the acoustic set on the first disc. Actually, the whole first disc is fantastic, but the acoustic is such a bonus and so well done here.<br />It has been recommended that you buy this AND TSRTS and that's a valid argument. Together they give you a pretty comprehensive overview of live Zeppelin from the early seventies, right around the time of Houses of the Holy. If you are not familiar with live Led, you should know that these are not note-for-note studio reproductions. Additionally, Jimmy Page has a tendency to get a bit sloppy live and some of the editing seems a bit more jagged than on TSRTS. Still, it is a very worthwhile collection of live performances and gives you a great companion piece to The Song Remains The Same. If you don't mind the somewhat steep price tag (although it is three discs), you'll enjoy the mighty Zeppelin live in all their sometimes ragged glory.
B0000DC13U|1.0|Great song; ridiculous movie.<br />  I'm of this silly generation, yet it is not the silliness of half this movie which bothers me. (The movie mixes footage of the Rolling Stones recording \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\" with immature, amateur social \\"commentary\\".)<br />  It is the arrogance and the ignorance which flows from this film that bothers me, the fakery that richness and idleness birth. Silly me! When I was impressionable, I listened to these jesters and these jumping jack flashes rather than the wisdom of the west.<br />  Maybe this is why so many had so many objections to us in the 1970s; we were so objectionable.<br />  Continue to listen to the song. Save yourself, though, from this dull, pornographic drivel. (Unless, of course, you want to see just how ugly and empty we were then.)
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|I can't rate this book highly enough! It is a must have title for any creative person involved in advertising and writing or idea generation. The writing is clear and concise and the concepts put forward are very easy to grasp. It has enhanced my way of thinking. I for one won't be lending out my copy to anyone, it's that kind of book. 10/10!
B000Z0OX9O|1.0|Do not waste your money on this 25th anniversary \\"soundtrack\\" as the additions you pay the extra money for aren't the soundtrack.  I have both the previously release CD Soundtrack and this, the 25th Anniversary Edition and was extremely disappointed at the two extra CDs in the 25th Anniversary you get for the extra money.<br /><br />The 1st CD is the same as the previous soundtrack CD release (which is only $10).<br /><br />The 2nd CD is supposed to contain unreleased music from the movie, but obviously Vangelis didn't have access to the movie sound samples (like he did with the original soundtrack CD) or its score apparantly, so he inserted what sound like MIDI reproductions of things like sirens and other sounds from the movie.  The annoying part is you're not only constantly thinking that's not the sound, your thinking its horrible!  It sounds like things a 14 yr old would make on his computer to sound like a siren etc. - which is way annoying.  The music isn't the same either, making you think he didn't have the old score and just recorded what he remembered from all those years ago - some of its closer to the movie some of it is very far away from what was in the movie.  It makes the 2nd CD so bad, it'd be better if it wasn't there.  I've litterally deleted the files off my computer because I know I'll never want to listen to them again.<br /><br />The 3rd CD doesn't have much to do with Blade Runner at all and seems to be a vehicle to get out some latest song creations which, really aren't that great (by Vangelis standards).  It's not as bad as the 2nd CD but has no relevance.<br /><br />Get the soundtrack CD (for $10) and not this 25th Anniversary product where you pay an extra $15 for 2 extra CD's of not what you are wanting.  Its too bad it could have been such a great CD set, but alas its not.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I don't have a lot to add to the reviews already submitted. I just want to say everyone should see this film. It is a sad commentary on the \\"American\\" way of life.... so full of individual greed without regard to the welfare of the nation. Very sad indeed. As stated in the film, it is hard to control a nation that is educated, healthy, and confident. It is much easier to govern a nation of people in debt, unhealthly, frightened and demoralized, as they are afraid to protest against the government. Guess which one we are ??!!
B000002IZM|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack adaptation (Vengelis took some artistic liberty by inserting some sounds from the actual movie, but its great) for Blade Runner, listen to this and the whole movie will come washing back over you.  Definately get this CD and not the 25th Anniversary (its a waste for the money..I have both).    Vangelis at his best.
B000J4QWNQ|5.0|As a fan of the original Miami Vice, and having grown up in Miami, I was somewhat leary of the \\"movie\\".  After watching it for the first time, I found myself disappointed.  I believe it was that it was nothing like the original show, and that was what I had come to expect, as most fans of a TV series would like.<br /><br />But, as a true lover of all movies, I watched the movie again, and then again and again.  I can now say after months and months and about 10-15 viewings, I have thoroughly grown to love this movie.  It stands on its own, as if the show had never existed - a 'different' version if you will.  The story line is fairly good, the cinematography excellent, I feel the acting was respectable, and the music is incredibly perfect and in the end makes the movie (great soundtrack).<br /><br />If you didn't like this movie, I'd suggest giving it another view and you may find to enjoy it as I did.  It now resides in my permanent HD-DVD collection, and how great it is to watch in 1080p.
0689829590|3.0|This book is very sweet, but it isn't as catchy as some of his better ones.  Very little kids definitely won't like it as much as The Very Hungry Caterpillar (holes to put their tiny fingers through), and the fold out part is vulnerable to toddler damage.
0060853980|5.0|So I read this book at the gym, on the treadmill one morning, and I laughed out loud ten or twelve times, until the concerned looks of strangers became overwhelming.  I suppose nearly everyone in the cardio section that day thought I was a nut, but I didn't care.  Virginians aren't known for their senses of humor.    It is really, really funny.  I've read nearly everything by Gaiman, and a bit of Pratchett, and this is my favorite, without a doubt.  If forced into choosing my favorite novels ever, this would be on the shortlist.    Just make sure you read it in a nice private spot, or you might receive a stern lecture on \\"disturbing the other members\\" as I did.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I think there are two groups of people who would not like the Pulse video.  1) You're not much of a Floyd fan to start with  2) You're a hardcore Roger Waters fan and any Floyd project without him isn't seems to be missing something.    I am neither.  I considered myself a decent fan up until I saw this, now I am a BIG fan.  The other reviews describe what you'll see and hear.  So, simply put, if you consider yourself even a casual fan, I don't see any reason you will not like this.

B000VL9XNI|5.0|Kiss could take a few notes from this 3 DVD set on how to improve their own \\"Kissology\\" series. AC/DC leaves nothing on the table, and this set is packed with performances, interviews, bonus footage, etc.      Disc one starts with the Bon Scott era, and it is amazing to see just what a powerful frontman he really was. Watching the 1977 interview with him, Bon comes across as almost shy, a far cry from his stage persona. You see Mark Evans, the original bass player from 1975-1977 in about half of the performances, and then Cliff Williams, the current bassist, come into the picture. One could only wonder how AC/DC would have progressed had Bon lived.      Disc two is the Brian Johnson era of AC/DC. From the widely popular \\"Back in Black\\" album on up, Brian's vocals fit perfectly with the band (as Bon's did, but in a different way) and he had his own definite stage presence. I really can't understand how difficult it must have been for Brian to try and fill Bon's shoes. The performances, from concert footage, to television, and the interviews in between are just awesome.     Disc three has a lot of rarities (such as Angus and Malcolm playing onstage with the Stones) to band rehearsels for the \\"Flick of the Switch\\" tour, to the Beavis and Butthead intro of the \\"Ballbreaker\\" tour.      Overall, I highly recommend this to any rock fan, as well as any AC/DC fan, and it is just an awesome package. One thing that you won't see AC/DC trying to do here (listen up, Gene Simmons) is milk their fans for every red cent they can get and delivering sub-standard releases. They put all their cards on the table with the production of this DVD. A+.
0316010669|3.0|First, the good -<br /><br />This book does an admirable job of demonstrating how and why people can make snap, \\"gut feeling\\" assumptions on topics they are experts in and be right, even when they can't give you a rational explanation for why they think what they think. Mr. Gladwell calls this \\"thin slicing.\\" I like the term, as it's descriptive and accurate. It is a phenomenon most of us are familiar with yet can't explain. Why did you switch lanes right before that other car swerved? Why did you get that feeling that person was just \\"wrong\\" before they suddenly went off? Most of us have experience this yet can't explain it. Gladwell does an excellent job.<br /><br />Where is all goes wrong, for me, is when Gladwell takes it into areas where the normal systemic processes are either altered or co opted, particularly in law enforcement. I've been in LE work for the better part of two decades and I can say that \\"thin slicing\\" is very applicable when cops are doing their routine work (why did they stop that guy right there who just happened to have an active warrant and a gun on him?) but once we start adding adrenal stress \\"thin slicing\\" becomes more problematic. When adrenaline hits the body in a crisis situation the amygdala, the part of the brain dedicated to survival, takes over, which is why it's hard to think under extreme stress. There are pre-programmed survival routines in everyone's brain, with the additional ones that can be added through appropriate training. When faced with a survival situation, the brain will shut down all non-essential functions and focus on surviving. This process includes the release of the drug adrenaline, which is the chemical authority the amygdala uses to enforce it's mission. This drug can very much influence perception. If you cannot accurately perceive an event you cannot \\"thin slice\\" it. This should be self-evident. Would we expect the art experts Gladwell mentions in one chapter make the same determinations if they were high on say, LSD? Of course not - altered perception alters results. Yet somehow Mr. Gladwell equates the calm, rational deliberation of art experts with the fear-addled, adrenaline charged incident of police officers engaging in lethal force situations. This does not compute. The standards are not the same and can't be judged equally.<br /><br />Place the art directors in fear of their life and let's measure that response, then we'll have an appropriate comparison.<br /><br />Minus the either intentional misrepresentation or misunderstanding regarding the effects on the human body of a life-threatening stress event, Gladwell makes some excellent points. This flaw, however, significantly damaged his hypothesis in my opinion.course not - altered perception alters results.

0618918248|3.0|This book was interesting at times, enlightening and funny at times, and even boring at times, but it didn't change my religious beliefs, or lack of, in any way. I though it might.  I didn't agree with everything that Richard Dawkins has to say here, but agreed with some and felt indifferent to the rest. I share Mr. Dawkins emphasis on the importance of separating church and state and the dangerous and probable circumstances if we fail to do this.  Personally, I'd love to see an atheist in the white house, or better yet somebody who refuses to divulge their religious beliefs at all (or lack of).<br /><br />We should not be afraid to question or seek answers to anything.  How else are we going to evolve?  As a human race, we will evolve - we will figure it all out - it is just a matter of how long it will take.  We have an eternity; what else are we going to do with all this relative time?  This IS, the only game in town after all.  As found on page 64 and written in a letter by Thomas Jefferson to his nephew...\\"Question with boldness, even the existence of God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of wisdom than that of blindfolded fear.\\"  And, as Mr. Dawkins says in both Chapter 4 and Chapter 8, \\"one of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.\\"<br /><br />What I mostly didn't like about this book was the authors choppy writing style; I didn't think it was as smooth as some of the previous reviewers.  I don't know, that might be more the reader and not the writer though.  Also, a good deal of the book is written from a righteous and stubborn, yet jesting point-of-view. Almost, and sometimes obviously poking fun at religion.  If Mr. Dawkins is trying to convert believers, his tactics have already been used by probably every religion.  That, to me, is just adding to an existing problem, not creating a solution.
B0001I55OC|5.0|My family really enjoyed this movie.  A little history mixed with fantasy and two love stories.
B000000Y2R|3.0|This concert has the makings of something quite magical.  Five of the best bebop musicians ever taking to the same stage.  Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to it's potential.  Apparently Bird, Diz, and Powell were all drunk...with Bird being the worst offender.  And Diz kept leaving the stage to go watch a big heavyweight boxing match that was being broadcast.  Bird also forgot to bring his sax so he was playing a cheap alto borrowed from a local music store.  Bud was on leave from a mental institution and required supervision, so he wasn't exactly at his best to start with.  Moreover, Bird and Diz left the stage for more than half the concert leving just a trio performing.  Max was impeccables that night, however, playing an amazing set with some powerful solos.  Mingus was tight as well, at least as much as could be heard.  The sound recording is ok on 3 or 4 tunes and dreadful on the rest.<br /><br />This recording is sad because it had so much potential.  If it was recorded properly and the musicians in shape and wanting to perform at their best this could have been one for the ages.  As it is, you get some decent bebop from three drunk guys (one of them being a mental patient), and a fantastic rhythm section recorded by an amateur through a third rate PA system at Massey Hall.  So this recording is nice but hardly magical.
B0001W8Q9Y|3.0|Probably this is the best Marillion album since Brave, but if you want the full experience of marbles, better buy the 2-cd english version exclusive form racket records web site. That 2 cd box has an extraordinary design, and a track that is not an extra, with \\"Neverland\\" is the core of the album, the song is called \\"Ocean Cloud\\", it takes about 17 min and is the final track of the first CD, and extraordinary and beautiful musical landscape. Get it from racket now.
B00005JO20|3.0|Obviously there's not much more to this movie than the special effects, but they are amazing enough to make it watchable, even at an excruciating 3 hours long.
B000YABV90|2.0|There is a certain beat that goes on in the universe;a certain music that if one is atuned to it will bring everything just right.Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) knows this;he feels this with every fiber of his being,and this orphan knows that the voice of his parents,both musicians (Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) both call out to him at night.He has never known them,they have never known him (in fact Russell thinks he is dead and Meyers never was informed of a pregnancy as far as I could tell)but he feels them in the talking of the wind,the watching of the moon,the moving of the wheat in the fields...etc.    I couldn't buy this earnest film for one minute.I found the story,itself, to be so full of holes, that swiss cheese had better consistency than this film.I understand the premise of this film,and it is certainly not without merit,but I will only suspend belief only so far.AUGUST RUSH seemed to be a 2007 version of \\"Oliver Twist\\" and \\"Annie\\" with a neat and sharply edited soundtrack to make up for it's totally implausible premise.As a musician,myself,who went to conservatory,I could  not buy Keri Russell performing the Elgar Cello Concerto,much less getting an invite to the prestigious Central Park Concert after an eleven year hiatus from her cello.Only the \\"being in sync with the universal rhythm\\" could have pulled that one off.Jacqueline DuPre,as talented as she was,could not have done that in her lifetime! Evan,whose name is changed to \\"August Rush\\" by a Faginesque Robin Williams,learns instantly to play the guitar like a pro and his genius is discovered and exploited when he brings his tips back to Robin Williams, who houses UNDETECTED street urchin musicians in an abandoned Manhattan Theatre.  The final and biggest hole occurs at the end when Jonathan Rhys Meyers is musically drawn to the concert in the park where Evan \\"August\\" is conducting his inspired rhapsody that just came to him.Meyers serendipitously pushes his way to the front of the enormouscrowd there to find Keri Russell after eleven years,he grabs her hand,nods to August....hello? did anyone ever tell him that HE was the father of this child?  For all of the smart editing and clever ideas that this film had, the story itself is pure ridiculous.The only thing that impressed me was that Jonathan Rhys -Meyers performed his own vocals.Highmore and Russell very obviously are not really performing and the quick edits hope to dazzle the viewer and keep them off balance from that fact.Some of the cuts of Russell playing both the Bach E Major Concerto and The Edward Elgar Concerto are deplorable with incorrect hand positions and simply on the wrong strings.Some people won't notice or even care about such things, but when you study music this film is like a history major seeing Ben-Hur with a wrist watch on! The editors were savvy to cut in and out in the music sequences in order to get that dizzying effect of the swirling of music, but all the guitar and cello coaching did not remotely pay off for me.Meyers was believable because he did his own work.This threw the believability factor of this film off for me.Meyers was spot-on, while Highmore and Russell were not.Why not find three REAL musicians?    Was this film destined to end on the right note? Yeah...there was never a doubt about it.It struck all the wrong chords with me.Cheesy and hokey are words that come to mind,but,hey,it's only a film .You won't get upset with my humble opinion as long as you are flowing with the rhythm of the universe.I am obviously out of sync and freely admit it!Here come the hateful votes...I can feel you wanting to push that button!
B000066F6H|3.0|3 1/2    Under a half hour The Hives tore through their snarling London-via-Sweden punk revival with glam-rcok inklings (found especially in the singers delivery for better or worse). Many songs do not have the bombastic vision that their singles usually possessed, but from the opening notes it remained undeniable that the unit, however derivative at times, attacked every note and word in full force, somehow almost justifying the short length of the lp.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I have watched this film several times over the years, and each time i see something new.  A great film about a genious 15 year old true fan of music that gets the break of a lifetime to write for rolling stone magazine.  He gets to go on the road with Stillwater, a fictional band, in 1973. But the music is great, the story is good, and you really get to know the characters.  Definite collection film, also available is a directors cut.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I first saw Sara in a little bar called Room 5 on La Brea in Los Angeles about 4 years ago.  She blew me away from her very first note.  I couldn't believe her voice was not already filling the airwaves.  I'm so glad to see her music reaching the wider audience she deserves.  Buy this Album!! It will not disappoint!!
B000XA5K48|4.0|A very different action movie.  Litterally, the movie is esentially about 90 minutes of shooting.  I am still confused if we really know the main character, or if he really is just a strange mysterious guy that tries to help a mom and baby.  At any rate, mindless violence for the action flick fan.  Worth getting.
B000O179A4|4.0|I liked this movie and I ordered it as a result of all the reviews but I preferred Sparkle
B00004VXF2|5.0|Metal Machine Music has been available on LP and CD of course, but it's really the perfect 8-Track!     All of its four sides are exactly the same length, so you don't have the problem of long periods of silence before a track ends, or having to break a song in two to fill the tape. On 8-Track, you can play as much or as little as you like, start at a point other than the beginning or end of a side, and it will continue forever if you don't take it out of the player. Even the \\"ker-chunk\\" sound the player makes when switching from track to track fits right in! I loved this tape when I had an 8-Track player.     And yes, I also love the recording in its other forms.
B00005BKZJ|4.0|This movie was not one that I had ever heard of and I ordered it on a spur of the moment. I was not dissapointed.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|As I already owned a number of versions of Il Barbiere di Siviglia, including one I was extremely pleased with (see my review of the version by Zurich Opera), I was not considering buying another one, so soon, until I heard Juan-Diego Florez perform on Donizetti's La Fille du Regiment. I agree wholeheartedly with the review by Toni Bernhard and can only add that apart from hearing Florez perform another role, the entire opera is a complete delight. From the assembly of the stage-set during the playing of the overture, through the ingenious use of black and white costumes and sets for most of the opera, the eccentric makeup of almost everyone except Count Almaviva and Figaro to the curtain dropping on the colorful set and crouching soldiers at the end of this performance from the Teatro Real, Madrid, this is a Barber of Seville that very successfully distances itself from all other versions available.
B000SQFC0E|4.0|I got this along with my new HDDVD player for Christmas and noticed that the case states its a combo disc and the info on the jacket even refers to a side a & b but the disc is clearly hd only.  Has anyone else gotten this?    HD works great and the description does not mention its a combo disc but it is very strange!
B000002H4C|4.0|I didn't see this movie for quite awhile but remember Felder's title song getting a lot of airplay, even if it's style is anything but \\"heavy metal\\". It actually sounds like an Eagles outtake now that I think about it. There's a lot of buried treasures here, and I think much of this is available nowhere else. I'm a big Steely Dan fan and cannot recall Donald Fagen's song appearing anywhere else, probably because it's melody is identical to Steely's \\"Third World Man\\". Same with Stevie Nicks' \\"Blue Lamp\\". I agree with the previous reviews that said Elmer Bernstein's symphonic tracks should've been included. And the songs here should've followed their order in the film.
0312330537|4.0|First, the good: Roberts is a genuinely talented writer. His Bombay tallies well with my own memories of the city. Some of his characters are amusing. His descriptions of prison and gangster life are interesting. And there's something about the book that kept me coming back to find out what happens next.<br /><br />But there's no escaping the bad. The first 50 to 100 pages were so good that I thought I was starting a great journey. But the early promise merely bubbled along rather than growing in intensity. The reason is that there's no real plot - merely a series of anecdotes strung together against a consistent backdrop. One of the best characters dies too early, and is not replaced by anyone nearly as interesting. And Roberts really does waffle on way too much with his pop psychology and pet philosophies.<br /><br />In the end, I'm giving this four stars rather than three because it did keep me turning page after page for 930 pages. And I'm a very fussy reader. I certainly don't regret spending the time reading the book.
B000Y179KO|3.0|The first thing you notice about the first new Eagles CD in 25 years are those harmonies. Don Henley and Glenn Frey mixed like Cali Creme, and they still sound amazing. There has not been another band been able to replicate that quality since The Eagles went their separate ways. The second thing you notice is that there isn't much kick to this CD. The songs sound like The Eagles, sure, but where is that lightning hot guitar lick that kicked \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" (or even \\"Get Over It\\") into high gear? You won't find anything like that on \\"Long Road Out Of Eden.\\" But if you're nostalgic for well constructed middle of the road 70's California music, \\"Long Road\\" delivers.<br /><br />What is really missing is any sense that the band is re-invigorated. Think of the way Paul McCartney's [[ASIN:B000PMLFRU Memory Almost Full]] or John Fogerty's [[ASIN:B000ULQVCK Revival]] leapt from the CD player and you'll wonder why Henley, one of the more progressive musicians out there, seems so muted. Admittedly, he throws a great zinger on \\"Frail Grasp on The Big Picture\\" when he snorts about \\"peanuts and politics,\\" but there is no muscle behind the music. It flows so smoothly that the two discs start to blur together. Set separately, the songs are all good, but laid along each other for over 90 minutes and the numbing sets in.<br /><br />That's why I held the review to three stars. My guess would be that a single CD with some fat trimmed off would have merited a fourth star, but even the best chocolate starts getting to be too much. Then again, who am I to say? As much as I dislike Wally-World, I was one of the near seven million who found myself at the checkout with a copy of this, and it's been in my CD changer for over a month now. It's not a classic album, but it has that classical [[ASIN:B0000DIXLM The Complete Greatest Hits]] Eagles feel to it. If Bon Jovi can ape this sound and get a number one out of it ([[ASIN:B000P2A24W Lost Highway]]), why not the men who all but defined the sound in the first place?<br /><br />Fave picks:<br />\\"Busy Being Fabulous\\"<br />\\"Frail Grasp on The Big Picture\\"<br />\\"How Long\\"<br />and the title song.e first place?     Fave picks:  \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\"  \\"Frail Grasp on The Big Picture\\"  \\"How Long\\"  and the title song.
1401206905|5.0|While I do not own this Hardcover edition (and thus cannot speak for it's quality, or lack thereof), I do own a reprint of this story.    In all honesty, I can't imagine a better origin for one of my favorite comic book characters.     Not only was it darker and more serious than the 1940's origin, it did an excellent job brining the character into the modern world (the 1980's anyway). An excellent revamp for this classic hero.
0345457692|4.0|Morgan has introduced a dark concept of immortality that flies in the face of what it means to have a soul.  If your mind never dies, then are you in fact immortal?  If so, what does it mean to change bodies?  Wrap these fascinating philosophical questions in a great cyberpunk style mystery story, and you have a very fun read.    Kovacs was dark, brooding, and at times sentimental, and it was this last aspect of Kovacs that lowered my rating from 5 to 4 stars.  Artificial sentimentality was the only point for me where the story lost its authenticity.    Robin cook explores a similar concept of immortality in his book \\"Abducted.\\"  Similarly, Tad Williams uses the concept of mind transfer for immortality in his \\"Otherland\\" series.  However, I think Morgan has taken the idea much further and in a more interesting direction than either of these two authors.    If you like cyberpunk, you will love this book and the series.
B00003CXDV|5.0|The people who made this movie really know Star Trek and the culture around it. The movie made fun of Star Trek without being mean. Fans of Trek should definitely be able to appreciate it. Even if you aren't a fan of said show, it's still tons of fun. It's silly and campy (in a well thought-out way). Any time I'm down or bored or just don't know what I want to watch, I can always pop this in and end op laughing my a** off. I've never been able to watch the whole thing in the alien language (language select section) but I thought it was a nice touch. A true nerd who enjoys and is comfortable being so made this movie for us!
B0011HOEY4|3.0|Rags to riches, it's the American dream. All too often in the movies, however, this dream is accomplished through crime. That's the story for Harlem gangster Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who has no problem selling drugs and/or murdering people to get to the top.<br /><br />Lucas is mentored by Harlem crime boss Ellsworth \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson in the late 60s. He learns everything from Bumpy, the ins and outs of the business. When Bumpy dies of a heart attack, the city is wide open and waiting for the next person to take over. As Johnson's heir of sorts, Lucas feels it's his duty to collect on past debts and keep the neighborhood status quo. To do this, Lucas turns to selling heroin.<br /><br />With the assistance of his brother in Vietnam, Lucas manages to import 100% pure product, something with which even the slightest dosage a person becomes addicted. In no time at all he has the market cornered with his product, \\"Blue Magic\\", and he is a millionaire with street-cred, and some serious clout.<br /><br />His rise to fortune comes with unwanted fame and trouble, however. He has trouble from other local drug dealers, from corrupt cops looking for a bribe, and from legit cops looking for a bust. Lucas realizes the eventual burden and responsibility; so, he calls on his family members to work for him and do the majority of the actual crime. When this becomes too profitable, and when a death occurs at the hands of \\"Blue Magic\\", he attracts the attention of Det. Richie Roberts (Crowe), a gum-chomping, do-gooder, workaholic whose only mission in life is to catch criminals.<br /><br />Just as in \\"Training Day\\", Denzel Washington is mesmerizing, commanding attention as a person who seems to have no limits and no conscience. His evil side, or at least a character capable of evil as in \\"Man on Fire\\", is fascinating, a truly marks Washington as one of Hollywood's elite. In this movie, he does not disappoint. Likewise, Russell Crowe nails his role as Richie Roberts. The mannerisms, the speech, the ragged nature, all exude the exact feel and look of the character he's portraying. What's disappointing, however, is that there is no epic meeting of the stars like when DeNiro and Pacino met in the diner in \\"Heat\\". They barely share the screen, and the viewer is left wondering what could have happened if they locked horns in a truly important and powerful scene.<br /><br />Another knock on the movie is its length: a whopping 2 hrs 37 min. It wouldn't have been bad if there were more action, but that just isn't the case. Aside from three or four real action scenes, the movie is boringly slow at times, and drags in others. It's wonderful story telling, but j u s t a l I t t l e s l o w. As a connoisseur of gangster movies, I expected much more in the actual \\"committing crimes\\"-department, even if slightly insignificant, in only to keep blood pumping.<br /><br />Nevertheless, American Gangster is a worthwhile movie. The drama and storyline alone are worth the price of admission. To see two heavyweights like Washington and Crowe square off makes it all that much more enjoyable.ture, all exude the exact feel and look of the character he's portraying.

B000UR9TQO|5.0|Fantastic Collectors Edition,a must have for any Zepp fan.  It's too bad it is so limited.You feel like you just went to the show after watching this. Great movie and extras.T shirt is nice as well as the other memoribelia that comes with it. what a deal. I wish I would have bought 2 or 3 more.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|Well written, well acted.  Lord of War maintains your interest easily.      Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a first generation immigrant who rises out of poverty and uses his quick wit and glib tongue to become a wealthy arms dealer, selling weapons and munitions to anybody with the cash to buy.  Yuri uses his success to buy the girl of his dreams, his beautiful home and his overall (on the outside, at least) beautiful life, but he finds out in a hurry that it's hard to maintain appearances like his, and that life can turn on a dime.    The opening sequence is one of the most interesting I've ever seen in a movie--and of course, it's a hit on YouTube.  The score is great as well.    Great movie all the way around.
B000006U44|5.0|I have loved Kate Bush since the seventies and still love to hear her sing \\"Wuthering Heights\\". What a beautiful song and a magnificent voice.   \\"The man with the child in his eyes\\" is another of my all time favorites. Bravo Kate. May you live on forever.
B000P12LWY|2.0|I don't subscribe to Showtime, so I didn't see the series when it was being aired originally.  I love history, though, although nobody shouold expect television to stick to accuracy, and thought The Tudors looked good.  The history part *isn't* totally accurate, but that was expected, so no surprises there.    Overall, the series was OK, but nothing special.  The plot centers around Henry Tudor--better known as Henry VIII--meeting and wooing Anne Boleyn, and trying to get shed of his wife, Katherine of Aragon.  The acting is OK; Jonathan Rhys Meyers does a pretty good job of brooding about and acting kingly and spoiled.  Gabrielle Anwar does a mediocre job of portraying Henry's sister Princess Margaret.  (Not to be catty, but she really hasn't aged well since doing The Three Musketeers.)  The costumes are really nice.  But overall, I felt like I was just waiting for something to happen.  The plot moves slowly; you just want to scream \\"Get on with it, already!\\" while praying for SOMETHING, ANYTHING of interest to happen and for momentum to pick up.    The final scene, with Henry and Anne FINALLY going at it in the forest, is probably the best one of the series.  Maybe that's because you feel such a sense of relief that something is FINALLY happening.    Not very exciting, the acting is just OK, and the history isn't always accurate.  I think this series is Showtime's attempt to keep up with HBO's excellent series, such as Rome and Deadwood, either of which are better written and acted.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|The fact that you may be reading this review means your at the very least curious about this DVD. It is a wonderful two-disk set that gives you everything you want and more.  You get the complete concert (amazing!) but the best part is the second DVD with the backstage pass and a piece titled \\"The Secrets\\" which gives you an insightful understanding of all it took to get this show together, and Celine's feeling about it(her initiation of the project, her change of heart, and the unltimate success of her sticking to it).  If your a fan of Celine's on any scale, this DVD just gives and gives and I know you'll love it.
0684833395|5.0|i don't even know where to start--just thinking of this novel brings a loony smile on my face. i've read this a couple of years ago while i was on fieldwork, and i remember being on the receiving end of worried and even stupefied stares from my friends whenever i had this book on my hands--there were times (a lot of times, mind) when i'd just laugh outright as i read thru the exploits of yossarian, major major (and then more majors), milo minderbender, nately, and other illustrious (or not) characters. their eccentricities are often amusing, beffudling, heartwrenching, and even enlightening.<br /><br />but besides the humor, there are a lot of issues in the story. people will be given a glimpse as to how it's like for soldiers to be in the thick of war, how they are slowly, subtly changed from the inside-out. heller has masterfully encapsulated the dynamics between and among ranks of soldiers, and even those people outside their outfit that they come in contact with, and what influences they have wrought against one another. morbidly fascinating, excruciatingly merciless, and awkwardly honest, catch-22 deserves to be in everyone's literature...
B0002DKCMG|5.0|This movie is great!  It's a hilarious comedy similar to the well-received American Pie movies.  The adventures these characters experience will make you laugh.  It's sure to brighten up your day and give you a taste of the European culture you were never taught in school.
0440241413|5.0|there were times i felt like an indulgent parent to our protagonist, rebecca, as she runs through her then almost-nonexistent bank account. it was downright funny to see her muddle through her arguments for the sake of appearing to have initial qualms about spending money, and then just ending up buying more than she has accounted for. you'd somehow want to shake some sense into her and at the same time, want to be arm-in-arm with her as she razes boutiques. she's definitely one of the most unique characters i've ever come across.<br /><br />some people may take an instant dislike to her, some may be amused, some even sympathetic, others just confused. whatever it may be, kinsella raises the bar on those chick-lits and has introduced us to a quirky, blessedly-oblivious, sadly-misguided, but sincerely adamant woman. and then of course, there's the de-lish luke. everytime he gets mentioned, i just get gooseflesh. there was some serious pondering as to whether he really deserves rebecca (since every time they meet it seems to begin and end in embarrassment), and yet somehow you can sense that he's the yin to her yang, whether rebecca's aware of it (forgive me, i'm being whimsical ^_ ^ ). a feel-good read!
B000FIMG68|1.0|This show had great promise in the first season, but season two it tried to milk the fan base loyalty too much and ended up going off the deep end.  Not only was season 2 slow, but the injection of fantastic and mystical explanations threw it beyond the realm of Twin Peaks' daydream sequences.  Better writers could have saved this show.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|We have not stopped laughing.  It is the sleeper hit of the past few years.  If you only watch one comedy show make it this one. GREAT!
B000000OSE|5.0|I remember when G'n'R hit it big with \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\"  It's easy to forget just how big that album was.  Almost all of the tracks went on heavy rotation on every rock station in the country for well over a year.  You couldn't turn on a radio or walk into a bar or go into someone's dorm room without hearing that album.  I love AFD, but even 20 years later I don't listen to it that much because of the oversaturation of its initial release.<br /><br />\\"Use Your Illusion\\", however, both I and II, are albums I still listen to at least monthly.  There are simply so many songs on these two albums that it was impossible to oversaturate the airwaves with them.  In a sense, that's too bad, because most of them are excellent songs that stand the test of time.  By and large, they're well crafted enough, and different enough from one another, to remain interesting.  Apropos to some of the other reviews, there is a jarring contrast between artier, more thoughtful songs like \\"Dead Horse\\" and \\"Cold November Rain\\" on the one hand, and the juvenile songs like \\"Back Off Bitch.\\"  Nevertheless, both \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums are chock full of excellent content.<br /><br />At the current Amazon price for these discs, you can't go wrong buying them if you are even a casual fan of G'n'R.  Recommended.
B00005JK8K|1.0|This movie would be vastly improved by being dubbed in the Navajo language with subtitles written by Woody Allen.
0440418569|3.0|Unlike other reviewers, I found the first volume good but not great, the second volume perhaps great but certainly more engaging, and the third volume at times great, but then (as others have pointed out) very disappointing.  The trilogy successfully invokes the sense of awe and wonder, then dashes both with quick and sloppy resolutions.  The last hundred pages are quite weak, and that tempts me to downgrade the book, but then I remember how I couldn't put the book down for the first few hundred pages, and I don't want the last impression to override the first.    Why write another review?  Because I saw echoes of another book I find (like many others) to be truly great -- A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay.  What I liked most about that book (and it has been some time since I reread it) was the voyage the character makes through a river of life, a poetic, dreamlike, and metaphorical journey.  I wonder if other readers saw this too in some of the prose surrounding \\"dust\\".    Finally, (semi-spoiler warning), I was confused by the resolution of the theme that Mary would be a temptress and Lyra would play the role of Eve.  I do see that Lyra faced the temptation to let love for an individual outweigh love for sentient beings in the multiverse, but the decision was made by her \\"Adam\\" as much as her (maybe even more so, as Adam's knowledge played a critical role in implementing the choice).  Mary was a nice character and all (and since Lyra played the role of Christ in this parable, Mary's name seemed like a good one), but she didn't play any role I could see in the temptation.  Anyone able to enlighten me?
0061142026|4.0|Tristran Thorn would do absolutely anything to win pretty Victoria Forrester's heart. Even venture across The Wall into mysterious Faerie in search of a fallen star.<br /><br />But once he enters Faerie, strange things begin to happen.<br /><br />Tristran knows the location of every place in the land. He meets a strange, small man who gives him a candle that allows him to travel great distances. And when he finally finds the fallen star, Tristran discovers that it is not a lump of rock like he thought, but a young woman, who has quite the mind of her own.<br /><br />Tristran, though, isn't the only one looking for the star. The witch queen and a group of three brothers all want something of it. For these brothers, it's the power she possesses.

B00005BF9Z|5.0|This album was my first experience with Manu Chao.  The style is simultaneously simple and complex.  From a musical standpoint, the instrumentation is primarily acoustic with simple rhythms, but lyrically and conceptually, nothing is simplistic about this masterpiece.  Various audio and linguistic themes weave their way through the work, giving the listener the experience of time suspension much like that of an insomniac in a sedated state of relaxed almost-sleep where thoughts almost form, transform into other thoughts, and then evaporate only to be replaced by new thoughts.<br /><br />Manu Chao employs a unique mixture of languages which form a drifting and ever changing cultural context.  I've never heard anything like it.
B000002H2H|5.0|Most fans will agree that Metallica's first four albums are all stellar examples of metal's ingenuity and potential to transcend the trashy image associated with it and actually identify as art.  Kill 'Em All is relentlessly thrashy and admittedly on the immature side, but still features innovation and intense musicianship which makes it stand out as a milestone of the 80's metal movement.  Master of Puppets is a more commercial work which features thematically complex material, extended, powerful songs with solid songwriting, and some of the band's more famous material.  ...And Justice For All is certainly their most complex and accomplished musically, with even longer and more intricate compositions than earlier in the band's discography, and also some of the most evocative and dark subject matter of any Metallica album.  Nevertheless, after much listening and admiration, this listener arrives at Ride The Lightning as his favorite Metallica album.      For me, Ride the Lightning is the most balanced and appealing of all Metallica albums--I'm open to any difference of opinion, but I feel that my views are well-justified.  Each song here is wonderful in its own way without drawing too much attention to itself, the collection of songs working together as a unified whole without seeming lofty and overwrought (I would argue that both Master of Puppets and Justice fall for this temptation of overindulgence without adequate focus--great albums as they both are).    Fight Fire With Fire kicks the album off in concise, expert fashion with  a pleasant and neat sounding introduction that erupts into a thrashing, rather overwhelming \\"body.\\"  The lyrics and riffs are all very evocative, with a thrash aesthetic that is simultaneously thoughtful and intelligent.  As others have noted, there is somewhat of a \\"thread\\" of continuity between early Metallica albums, and this song is comparable in many ways to MOP's Battery, Justice's Blackened, and Kill 'Em All's Hit The Lights.  Basically, it kick-starts the album and prepares listeners for the aural assault to come.    The title track comes next, and it is certainly one of the better songs on the album, with thematic content surrounding death (specifically The Electric Chair) and a thrashing, overwhelming execution (no pun intended) that will satisfy just about any fan.  This song \\"mirrors\\" the other title tracks from Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All--both of which are amazing pieces of metal songwriting.      For Whom The Bell Tolls is another amazing track.  It fills the role of a heavy, somewhat slow moving but nevertheless rocking mini-epic, out of which Metallica would go on to shape \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" and arguably \\"Eye of the Beholder,\\" too.  If you ask me, though, For Whom The Bell Tolls is significantly more well-crafted than either of those subsequent works.    Fade to Black is the prototypical \\"power ballad\\" Metallica style, maybe in its least melodramatic and unrefined form, which is a good thing.  Whether \\"One\\" from And Justice For All or \\"(Welcome Home) Sanitarium\\" from Master of Puppets is the better out of these three is all a matter of personal opinion--it still stands that Fade to Black is an incredible, rather depressing song about suicide which has everything one would expect from a lower, more heartfelt metallic rocker.  It builds upon itself in a very progressive way and reaches a climax that is simultaneously relieving and disturbing.  There's a reason why this song still receives airplay and frequent referencing by fans.  It's awesome.    Trapped Under Ice comes next, which is a more straightforward but still jarring and intense piece of metal.  It's fast and thrashy, with themes of psychological alienation and depression.  It carries with it a strong sense of anxiety and intensity that isn't present in some of Metallic's slower-paced songs.  Not my favorite on the album, but I'm glad it is here and it fulfills its role nicely.    Escape contrasts with Trapped Under Ice, chugging along rather than churning, and is generally a less-insane, but nevertheless very heavy number that could easily find a place on the radio or other more \\"mainstream\\" musical outlets.  It's a fairly underrated Metallica song as it doesn't receive as much recognition as some others on this album, but it is nearly at the level of \\"Creeping Death\\" and \\"Fade to Black\\" in its solid construction.    Speaking of Creeping Death, the penultimate song on the album is generally considered among the band's most admirable efforts, and with good reason.  The musicianship is painstakingly precise, but also groovy and organic.  There is a strong sense of pulse and the lyrical content of religious and mythological history (more specifically the story of Moses and the \\"Creeping Death\\" which fell across the Pharaos).  The chorus is terribly catchy and anthemic, and just keeps coming back at wonderful times.  For me, it's one of the most infectious and propulsive of all Metallica songs--one gets the sense that the song really is akin and comparable to the Creeping Death that fell across the land in biblical times--one couldn't stop it even if one chose to.  The band all seem very involved and passionate during this song, and it also features amazing solos and complex rhythmic thrashing on Cliff Burton, James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett's parts--the song's climax and middle sections are both amazing, as is the entire song.  This is probably my favorite song on here, and among my top Five Metallica songs of all time.    The Call of Kthulu is another delightful piece of epic metal, this time sans vocals, but with an even greater sense of mysticism and eerie melodrama than the legendary epic quality of Creeping Death.  The subject matter this time is the H.P. Lovecraft tale of the same name, which is a highly imaginative, romantic-gothic-monster-horror story.  The song is appropriately fantastical and ominous, with a very expansive, unhinged sound that obviously inspired later instrumental efforts \\"Orion\\" and \\"To Live is to Die.\\"  Orion seems to receive more recognition as Metallica's greatest instrumental, but I think that The Call of Kthulu is every bit as important and satisfying.  It's lengthy without feeling excessively slow, and never seems to drag or repeat itself unnecessarily, even though the song as a whole is composed of a few key elements which are repeated, morphed and built upon.  The ending is especially triumphant and bombastic.  A stellar closer to a great album--indeed, likely Metallica's most focused, concise and balanced work...personal opinions aside :)
0143038419|3.0|I was lucky to get this from the library - even got a large print copy. What inspired me was Hillary Clinton's admission that she had recently read it. In responding to the usual \\"What are you reading now?\\" Hillary postulated about the latest Eisenhower biography but then smiled when she mentioned \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\". Think the word \\"chick lit\\" was thrown in at that point. I would love to know Hillary's reaction to this picaresque tale.    Elizabeth Gilbert seems to be thrice blessed. Not only did she receive a down payment to conduct a journey that assuaged all her appetites, but she credits a generous aunt & uncle who supported this yearlong sabbatical, and lists all her friends who helped a new found friend and single mother purchase a home in Indonesia. If you like happy endings you'll love this book.     Gilbert's Roman dolce vita isn't as good as more popular recitals of Italian sojourns written by American women, but her stay at an Indian ashram gives us  insight on why folks travel thousands of miles to get up at 3  AM, chant endlessly, scrub temple floors, and then sit still in meditation caves for the rest of the day. Finally, her Balinese interlude reads like a page from a Gaugin journal. The final escape to a Honeymoon Dream Island is the frosting on her cake (the author's metaphor not mine).     Humor is the saving grace in this memoir. Anyone who can take off a year and meet Luca Spaghetti, a yoga practicing Texas cowboy, and a medicine man who's between 65 and 120 years old deserves the attention of  the omnivorous American reader.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|i enjoyed the first two movies, but this one is better. They hired a good<br />director for this one that keeps the movie flowing pretty good.

Great movie, we saw it 100+ times and we DON'T wanna go back! Wanna know why? Cause besides the fact that there were far more deaths on Titanic (more tragic), Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this and that there is one maybe two main characters you'll actually recognize in this one (I recognized Kurt Russell only), this movie was FAR BETTER in EVERY OTHER WAY.<br /><br />Who cares that Titanic had a better orchestra, we're here to see the action: People dying, surviving and overcoming tragic occurrences and once the boat starts to capsize, sink and fill with deathly water, the action truly never stops. If anything, it slows down, but NEVER stops, TRUST IN ME.<br /><br />The characters were pretty good. I won't say who died but I will say that I won't be surprised if someone who's watching with you (if you're not a movie loner) sheds a tear or starts to seriously ball before the very end.<br /><br />The people involved in this tiny tragedy were pretty expressive, especially the females. When Kurt Russell went back to stop the propeller fans that stood in the way of true freedom instead of his daughter's husband/boyfriend/fiancee, his daughter began to sulk. And when it took a while for him to come back (does he come back? Find out!) she broke down and I did too. I shed a small tear out my right eye as I felt half as bad as she did at the time. Very decent acting. Even the kid was just beneath brilliance!<br /><br />The ending was very sad but not without light. The actors and actresses put on a damn good show and the special effects were decent and aplenty.<br /><br />--Not Titanic 2.0 (Thank goodness)<br />--Good acting<br />--Music is kept in the background once the ship capsizes<br />--Action aplenty<br />--Special effects here and there and here again<br />--Characters meet their fears eye to eye and face them<br />--So worth your time<br />--Don't listen to the naysayers<br /><br />Cover Art: A- (Frightening but puts the movie into perspective, summing it up without really watching it first)<br />Inside Art: N/A<br />Characters: A<br />Dialogue: B-<br />Story: C+<br />Comedy Relief: D+<br />Music Score: D- (I hardly remember anything besides the lame music that played when everyone was fine and laughing...)<br />Length: A<br /><br />4.45 stars.<br /><br />Overall: A-orth your time  --Don't listen to the naysayers    Cover Art: A- (Frightening but puts the movie into perspective, summing it up without really watching it first)  Inside Art: N/A  Characters: A  Dialogue: B-  Story: C+  Comedy Relief: D+  Music Score: D- (I hardly remember anything besides the lame music that played when everyone was fine and laughing...)

B000Y7U98C|4.0|A film like Sunshine is among the group of movies that get released every year where critics and moviegoers sing its praises and can look past its faults yet it never gets huge box-office and merely becomes one of those sleeper or cult hits. I was a fan of Danny Boyle's best-known work, Trainspotting and I liked 28 Days Later (although oddly I like its sequel better) but I always looking forward to Sunshine although couldn't see it until recently thanks to a shoddy local theater and after viewing it, I wouldn't say it's my favorite film of last year but it's certainly on the list.    It's 2057 and the sun is dying, leaving Earth in freezing weather and winters so a mission is put into action: with the help of the ship, the Icarus I and a bomb the size of Manhattan, the crew intend to put the Sun back to full bloom and prevent the Earth from entering a new ice age. But something goes awry and contact is lost so a second team, the Icarus II, is sent to finish what the other crew didn't. But worries of failure of this mission, the fate of the entire human race resting in the hands of 8 crew members and then there's the reappearance of the Icarus I and the trouble it will take to succeed.    Instead of space films like Event Horizon, Alien and the like, Sunshine is more about existential matters and showing awe-inspiring imagery rather than just going for cheap thrills and quick entertainment. With the help of a fantastic score, many scenes in Sunshine go for a more emotional punch than most space movies that are thankfully not as abstract and dense like 2001. And while I don't mind its third act, many people might find an issue with its tonal change and breaking the feel that the entire film was establishing to that point (although I love the scene that introduces this shift).    Writing characters are a tricky business since if you give them distinct personas or quirks (often called one-note characters), people find them too cookie cutter and not enough substance whereas if you give everyone gravitas and weight, they don't become distinct and instead just become part of a group rather than singular, unique characters. But like Alien, the crew is very distinct and each do their parts well although some aren't given much to do. One character, for example, is so fascinated with the sun that he likes to watch it from an observation deck at varying brightness (over 4%, it can burn out your retinas) but other than that, it doesn't do much. The more memorable ones are Cillian Murphy, the ship's \\"bomb boy\\", Chris Evans as the straight-thinking one and uber-cutie Rose Byrne.    With a unique visual style not commonly seen in space movies, a beautiful score and some great visual effects, Sunshine is a worthwhile film to check out.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Only 14 episodes and 1 movie. How could Fox cancel this show!?! Joss Whedon is a master at creating a character with 3 quick lines, an ensemble is in a couple of scenes and a universe in less than 15 minutes. The problem is after you've entered any of his worlds you suffer withdrawal symptoms immediately upon leaving them. So here I am... I've watched all the episodes at least twice and the movie 3 times. I'm contemplating looking for a spin-off paperback, but deep down I know that won't help. Maybe Fox will see reason and Joss Whedon will renege on earlier statements that he is done with Firefly and Firefly will start anew! And maybe gas prices will return to double digits. Anyway, I recommend this series to one and all. Please Mr. Whedon if you read this at least consider returning to TV!!!
B0002O06N0|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life. If you enjoy blues or rock you owe it to yourself to get this album. The first time I heard The Black Keys my musical world was changed forever and I don't know how I listened to music before them. In my opinion this is their best album and definitely worth the purchase. My favorite song on the CD is 10 AM Automatic - a fantastic rocker that really emphasizes what these guys are all about. When the Lights Go Out, Just Couldn't Tie Me Down, and All Hands Against His Own are fantastic tracks. Girl Is On My Mind and Stack Shot Billy are two really funky tracks that just make you want to groove. In conclusion, The Black Keys deserve much more recognition for making such great music and everyone should own this album.
B000XA5K48|3.0|In \\"Bully for Bugs,\\" Bugs Bunny, once again making that \\"wrong turn at Albuquerque,\\" finds himself a spectator inside a bullring, where a magnificent bull is making short work of an overmatched toreador. Bugs is minding his own business -admittedly in the wrong place at the wrong time - \\"What's up, Doc?\\" - when the not amused bull bucks Bugs out of the arena and into the stratosphere.  As Bugs, tail jacked up, is propelled toward the heavens, he turns to the camera and declares with an annoyed smirk, \\"Of course you know, this means war!\\"  There ensues an outlandish, over the top, war of wits between Bugs and the bull fought with such implements as an anvil, a slingshot, a rifle, elephant bullets, axle grease, and a crude Rube Goldberg device that employs TNT.     \\"Shoot `Em Up,\\" the Michael Davis directed movie starring Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti and Monica Bellucci is like an 86 minute live action version of that classic 1953 cartoon short.  The movie opens on a extreme close-up of our hero \\"Smith\\" (Clive Owen) taking a deliberate bite out of long stemmed carrot.  Taciturn Smith is our Bugs and he has definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere, although it may not have been Albuquerque .       Full of righteous indignation, Smith hates everything.  He hates \\"40-year old jack-holes wearing ponytails,\\" as he informs us before blowing the back of head off of a 40-year old jack-hole wearing a ponytail.  He hates privileged yuppies who park in handicap spaces we learn before he smashes the driver's side window of an illegally parked Mercedes before stealing it.  And he hates guys changing lanes without signaling, as we discover when he forces said guy off the road causing him to smash into a parked car.     Paul Giamatti, more bully than bull, is the malevolent Elmer Fudd of this piece.  Giamatti takes delicious delight in his devilishness.       Once Owen and Giamatti have engaged in \\"Of course you know, this means war!\\" one-upmanship, \\"Shoot \\"Em Up\\" devolves into one spectacularly choreographed scene of mythic mayhem after another.  In fact, \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is so jacked up on a Red Bull high of Testosterone injected vitriol, that you can seldom catch your breath let alone make heads or tails of what is going on.  Until about three-quarters in, the movie moves so fast, you are just jerked along, unable to make any of the human connections you would need to make in order to care.     Of course, the movie uses the stock device that has informed movies from their infancy: the imperiled infant.  Not since \\"Raising Arizona\\" has such a sweet countenanced kid been put in such stark danger.  Except, \\" Arizona \\" being a comedy, you knew nothing was going to happen to Junior.  In \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" all bets are off.     The plot of \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is almost as cartoonish as the action.  There is so much ammunition dispersed in this movie, with the guns and gunplay erotized to a level nothing human approach in this movie, it is almost laughable that a gun control initiative is at the heart of its overblown action.  Like watching a porn movie about abstinence, this is kind of a turn-off.     That said, the adrenaline rush of \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" should not be missed.  I recommend turning on the subtitles (some of the best throw-away lines may be missed if you don't) and watching it as a live action comic book.  Then watching it again.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|The first movie I watched on our new HDTV. What a disappointment! I kept thinking that the picture was nowhere near as nice as I was expecting and had seen in stores, etc. The problem was not my equipment, but the \\"style\\" of the film. For theatrical effect, the picture has the appearance of having been filmed through very slightly frosted glass. This technique, whatever, causes the background to appear as if there is considerable noise in the signal (not \\"snow\\", but not a steady background). Very strange. The features on the DVD are filmed normally, and look terrific...    On to the story. This is a film adaptation of a COMIC BOOK. The gratuitous nudity, and splattering blood ad nauseum are completely expected once you know the original medium. It is too bad, as the story is actually a pretty good one but gets too mired in the over-the-top gore to match the excellence of films such as Gladiator.     Worth watching once. Not worth owning.
051788710X|5.0|A good \\"how to\\" book.  Very helpful if you want to learn to remember, journal & analyze your dreams.  Since I read this book, my life has changed--I have experienced or remembered messages from ancestors and  healings.  When you wake up in the morning you cannot always remember that dream; it is right on the tip of your brain, but you just cannot remember.  This book will help you reach in and \\"get it\\".

0143038419|4.0|I took this book with me on a recent trip to New York; not knowing I would have plenty of time to read it during several airport delays.  I found it to be very entertaining and could often relate to the experiences shared by Ms. Gilbert.  I enjoyed the wonderful stories of eating in Italy because I spent a week in the Tuscany area some time ago and enjoyed the same pleasurable experience.  I often found myself relating to the stories of her life and wishing I had a highlighter to mark specific passages that I wanted to remember.  Sure, there are some things in the book that are not as I perceive them and beliefs that I choose not to follow...but I believe that one has to approach life and learning with an open heart and mind; filtering what is useful and true to you and what is not.  So, as I read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" I took some in and and let some go.  I think I took more than I left and I am actually going to read it again.  This time with my highlighter to mark those special areas that specifially touched my mind, body and soul. I believe Elizabeth Gilbert wrote this book not to convert the reader but to inform them of her conversion and the growing process of change.  Her writing is candid and real...intelligent and humorous. I would recommend this book to anyone with a desire to grow beyond their own self-imposed comfort zone and step out of their box.

0887307280|4.0|Michael Gerber's 'The E Myth - Revisited' quite honestly annoyed me on the first read.  I thought of it as a corporate methodology course written for the small business owner.  However, I really wanted to believe in this book and on the second read, it made sense perhaps because I started re-building and re-positioning my businesses at the time.<br /><br />On the third read, it really made sense -- now on to the specifics.<br /><br />Gerber asserts that the best businesses have people, procedures, and systems.  They also provide a place of meaning, provide a sense of purpose, and of course satisfy needs as expected (or better)!  The arrangement of the book is key.  Gerber realizes that successful businesses start with the individual or group that establishes them.  Business owners do have to have a sense of purpose and a sense of who they are and what they want their business to accomplish.  His \\"names\\" for these internal processes are termed the Primary Aim and Strategic Objective.<br /><br />He goes on to proceed to how the business will look and getting organize.  This step is critical and is the first chapter I \\"blew off\\" on the first read - it was just to CA.  Gerber knew that readers would think this, but  this is perhaps one of the most important chapters.  Afterwards, Gerber goes into the normal processes of people development, leadership, marketing, organizational structure, and weaving the pieces together to give a systematic (and predictable) result.<br /><br />The reason I believe in this book is because my companies utilized his recommendations and the results led to us having a feeling of \\"re-birth.\\"  This is not corporate America \\"jumbo\\".  This is real world information that can really make the difference between success and failure.  It's the techniques utilized by the best consulting companies when they go to \\"fix\\" or try to \\"fix\\" your organization.  But if you read and put into practice what he recommends one will find (in our opinion) that they are their own best consultants - and even better - executers, which is what business is about!<br /><br />Great read - recommended reading for business owners (large and small).ants - and even better - executers, which is what business is about!    Great read - recommended reading for business owners (large and small).
B0007939NO|4.0|\\"Brigadoon,\\" (1954), a fantasy/musical/romance, was another triumph for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's busy music division, under the stewardship of Arthur Freed.  It was based on the 1947 Broadway hit of the same name, the first hit, and second collaboration of those devoted anglophile partners Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe - see \\"Camelot\\" and \\"My Fair Lady.\\" The film was directed by Vincente Minelli, in his first venture into Cinemascope.<br /><br />The plot, of course, is somewhat reminiscent of \\"Shangri-La,\\" just moved to the United Kingdom.  It's pretty well-known: two vacationing New Yorkers, Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly), and Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson) are grouse-shooting in Scotland when they stumble into Brigadoon, a town not on any map.  That's because, as the result of a previous enchantment, it's disappeared into the Scottish mist, to reappear for only one day every hundred years.  So Albright, the Kelly character, of course meets a girl Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse.)  Kelly, as it happens, was kind of bemused to find himself starring in this movie.  He hadn't starred in it on Broadway, but the studio had decided to change the emphasis of the entertainment from singing to dancing.  Thus Kelly was signed.  He had made his Broadway debut, and become a star in \\"Pal Joey,\\" but had lost that part to Frank Sinatra, when Columbia, the studio that filmed that little item, decided to shift the emphasis there to singing, rather than dancing.  However, Kelly had an acceptable voice.  Cyd Charisse is one of the great dancers, but she couldn't sing: she's dubbed by Carole Richards in \\"Almost like Being in Love,\\" biggest hit of the stage and screen versions.  Johnson plays his usual, cynical best bud to the star.<br /><br />Kelly and Minelli were known to be disappointed that budget problems -- and the fickle Scottish weather, another way of saying possible budget problems-- prevented them from filming on location in Scotland, as had been planned.  Instead, they filmed before studio sets, that are, however, quite detailed, and fantastical in feeling: they actually add to the movie's ambiance.  The Scots accents are wavering, however; they might have turned out better on location.  No matter, Kelly and Charisse memorably dance up hill and down dale in \\"Heather on the Hill,\\" and few viewers will really care whether the landscape is actual, or painted.  As for \\"Go Home to Bonnie Jean,\\" it's a rousing, all-singing, all-dancing, grand spectacle of the kind that MGM made its name on.  The studio might not have spent its bottom dollar on this film, but when Kelly and Charisse dance, who cares?that are, however, quite detailed, and fantastical in feeling: they actually add to the movie's ambiance.

0307383415|5.0|Dreams from my Father, A story of Race and Inheritance By Barack Obama, Three Rivers Press<br /><br />In Dreams From My Father, Obama wrote of his efforts to understand his family, the leaps through time and the collision of cultures hoping to shine light on the question of identity and race in the American experience.<br />He described the \\"underlying struggle between worlds of plenty and worlds of want, between modern and ancient cultures.\\" He admired those \\"who embrace our teeming, colliding irksome diversity while insisting on values that bind us together\\". And he feared \\"those who seek, under whatever flag or slogan or sacred text,to justify cruelty towards those not like us.\\"<br />  The book shows how powerlessness twists children's lives in Jakarta or Nairobi in much the same way it does on Chicago's South Side and how quickly despair slips into violence.  It discusses how the powerful respond with a dull complacency until violence threatens them and they then use force,(longer prison sentences and more sophisticated hardware)  inadequate to the task.<br />  He struggles constantly to understand this problem and his place in it. He is now  professionally engaged in a broader public debate that will shape our lives and the lives of our children for many years to come.<br />  If he had known his mother was dying so young, he would have written a different book, less a meditation of the absent parent and more a celebration of the one who was the single constant in his life.  He shares some of the stories his mother and her parents told him when he was a child. \\"<br /> Obama feels we have all seen too much to take his parents' brief union, a black man and a white woman an African and an American at face value.  He says when black or white people who don't know him well, discover his background they no longer know who he is.<br />  This is the record of a personal interior journey, a boy's search for his father and a workable meaning for his life as a black American.<br />Obama says, \\"I can embrace my black brothers and sisters whether in this country or in Africa and affirm a common destiny without pretending to speak for all our various struggles.\\"<br />Much of this book is based on journals or oral histories of his family.<br /> Obama says he tried to write an honest account of a particular province of his life.'<br />Without the love and support of his family, his mother, his grandparents and his siblings, stretched across oceans and continents he could never have finished it<br />He was born in Hawaii, lived several years in Indonesia then lived in New York City where he went to Columbia University.  In1983 he was a Chicago community organizer and a civil rights lawyer.<br />His Aunt Jane whom he had never met called him from Kenya to say his father was killed in an auto accident.  His parents had divorced when he was two years old and he had only seen his father for one month when he came to visit Obama and his mother in Hawaii.<br />. When he went to Kenya his half sister Auma and his Auntie Zeitumi met him<br />They took him to meet Aunt Jane and other African family members.<br />  Family seemed to be everywhere in Kenya and Obama found himself meditating on just what is a family  He sat on his father's grave and spoke with him through the African red soil.<br />When he returned to America he met and fell in love with Michelle who had been raised in Chicago.  After their engagement he took her to Kenya to meet his family there  They returned to the United States and married.<br />This is an absorbing and moving tale of a man who takes a journey to his father `s home where he lived much of his life and died.  Obama re-evaluates his relationship with the myth of his father and the meaning of his own life.  It is a quiet but intense examination of a man's past and his son's attempt to understand it.<br />Examining his family's life and thinking about his own, Obama finds a certain relief reliving times and behavior that had slipped into the undifferentiated past and finally arrives at some kind of understanding.<br />  The writing style is exciting,, a well written blend of memoir and history.  The rich narrative and interesting characters keep the reader turning pages.  Obama's sensual descriptions made the reader feel he is visiting south side of Chicago, Harlem, Indonesia or Kenya.  You see the people, hear their voices, taste and smell the food,, feel the breeze and smell the ocean..<br />This is a book I would have enjoyed even if had not been written by a well-known, fascinating man beginning to put his mark on the world.a certain relief reliving times and behavior that had slipped into the undifferentiated past and finally arrives at some kind of understanding.

B000SO7OL6|3.0|I rated this average because I think some other works Diana has done should have been included on this CD.  Matter of fact I was a little disappointed with some of the selections.  However, Diana is an excellent entertainer and I love most of her stuff.

B000NVIXDW|4.0|Michael is an amazing talent.  I saw him 2 years ago, and could not believe how magical his performance was. I think my favorite song on this CD is \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\", and my second favorite is \\"That's Life\\".  Michael is definitely the new Frank Sinatra.  Buy it.  You'll love it.
B000W07EKW|4.0|Overall I'm happy with my purchase.  I told myself as soon as they released the Bourne box set I was going to buy it...and preorder it I did.  It would have been nice if the bonus CD was more robust but still, the movies are awesome, the collector box is cool and I have what I believe to be one of the best, most consistent film trilogies available, in my collection.

B000R6PKP2|5.0|Good story here. Since i was a little boy my father always told me about the theatrical release of the BladeRunner. When DVD's first came out the only BladeRunner we could find was the 1st Directors Cut. When i heard that this set wil have every release of bladerunner ever i had to go out and get it for him. When it arrived via UPS the first thing we did was watch the original 1984 Theatrical release and it was everything that he ever said it was. The other versions to me are good, but nothing will ever be better then the original release, its raw and doesnt feel too processed as the other versions.  The box was cool and also the bonus' like the movie stills, the model police car and the unicorn.
0761145613|4.0|I had this calendar last year and I really love it.  The only thing about this year's calendar is that it does not have the bottom pocket that last year's did.  I really liked that pocket because I would put appointment cards, birthday invitations, directions, etc in there and then I always knew where to find them.  But I still love the calendar....just wish it had the pocket.
0609610570|4.0|I was triggered by the title. I my business life I have seen and written quite a substantial amount of businessplans. And we all know that many times a businessplan is soon forgotten, just a short while after its presentation. This book is solely dedicated to ´discipline of getting things done´. Simply put the discipline that sets the top performers apart from the rest. A must read for anyone involved in (business) planning. Practice it and you will be amazed by the results.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|After listening to the first 2 albums with the band reunited, I was not sure what direction this one was going to take. I know that fans were clamoring for Harder edge and I was one of them.      I think we got what we asked for, as this is much heavier than the first  two. The songs are the usual fare for an Iron Maiden album so there is really nothing new here in terms of lyrics, but the music that surrounds  these songs is always great. I think the only thing left to tweak is the length of the songs, as the 7 minutes per track is a bit too long. This is  not, Somewhere in Time\\" where the longer songs worked. I think 5 minutes would make most of these songs on MOLAD really great.        Still this is good stuff and I cannot wait for the next album    to come out.
0671646788|3.0|Not a very original view on focusing your mind on positive outcomes and living the right attitude. The author shares a lot extraordinary real life stories. Although it does not seem a masterpiece, I keep reading it time and time for some positive mindfuel.

The story is interesting and the lead character  Driver is likeable but, I found it difficult to follow. I am still not sure what crime the opening scene is connected to.

B000JLSM00|5.0|\\"The Searchers\\" ranks with the finest films of the twentieth century, and of course with John Ford's very best westerns. This Blu-Ray disc is the best home video version yet. The hi-def transfer is extraordinary, and very close to the 35mm print version I saw when the film was restored and re-released in the early 90s. Color, sharpness, and picture stability are right on the money.     If you love American film, don't miss this disc.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I had heard many things about this toy, how great it was, how it had won a bunch of awards etc...  But I still wasn't certain how it worked and whether it would be interesting, especially after the first couple of games.  But I am glad to say that it has been quite enjoyable to play, both with adults and children.  It teaches strategy and challenges the players to think about both positive and negative spaces.  It is fairly adaptable for a variety of ages. I look forward to many more games.

B000VLE3IS|4.0|As long as I've been listening to Rock & Roll music, there's always been Led Zeppelin. Zep is one of those influential bands that's so \\"heavy\\" in stature that when they had their first reunion concert in 2007, the list of other bands who came to see it was seriously impressive. However, that's part of my \\"problem\\" with Zep. They're so popular (they have their own dedicated channel on XM Radio now, all Zep 24/7), that their songs were so overplayed on the radio, I never had any real desire to own a greatest hits package of theirs. I could hear all this stuff on the radio.<br /><br />So in 2007, Zep finally decided to release all their music on iTunes. Everything was remastered, and from those sessions came a new 2 CD Greatest Hits package - Mothership. I figured now was the time. So I ended up picking this up. There's not a song on here I didn't know. Admittedly, they're not all as overplayed as \\"Rock & Roll\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", & \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", but there's no surprises here for me. With perhaps one exception. They sound awesome! Zep is from an era when sound was muddled, and you listened to their music stoned, and you didn't care about audio fidelity. Now in the year 2008, folks (even the stoners) aren't into that. You're into clarity, power, and sonic resonance. The Zep tunes have never sounded quite this good to my now 42 year old, too much metal, permanently ringing ears.<br /><br />The overall selection of tracks is nice, and you get all the hits, and a few second tier songs which is quite nice, too. I am of course hanging onto Zep 4 (how can one get rid of that), and In Through the Out Door (my fav, because it's the least played Zep album). But this will probably be more than enough for me to get my fill of Zep when I want to listen now.<br /><br />There is a third disc in this package, a DVD as well, which is a sampling of material from the \\"Led Zeppelin\\" DVD set released a few years ago. Nice value in there, but I would assume if you owned that box set, you wouldn't care about this. As I've read in other reviews, there is nothing \\"new\\" here except perhaps the upgraded (to me anyway) sound. If you have all of Zep's albums already, you really don't need this. But if you don't, or want a sonic upgrade on their most well known stuff, than grab this. It's a pretty darned good price for a 3 disc set.ut this.

075640407X|3.0|[minor spoilers follow]                      This is a bit of a problematic book for me to review...    I really liked Patrick Rothfuss's writing style, and enjoyed the book as I was reading it.     I enjoyed the university, even with the Snape and Malfoy clones.    I liked the magic system. I especially liked how knowing (and understanding) the true name of something (like the wind of the title) can give you power over it.    And the Chandrian, with their blue flames, show promise as the mega-villains of the piece.    But...    *Not a whole lot happens in this book, especially considering its 600+ page count.     * I found the bits of present day framing story(especially the demons and hints of war) to be a lot more interesting than a lot of the flashback stories (and the flashback stories took up the majority of the novel).    * Kvothe is just too good at too many things (particularly given his young age - he is what? 15 at the close of the flashback sequences of the book?), and it irritated me after awhile. Seems to me that both his magic studies and his music would be extremely demanding mistresses, and I just do not buy that he would be so good at both at such a young age, even with natural gifts    * the street orphan sequences in Tarbean go on way too long. He is living on the street and he is poor and hungry. I get it. Does this really have to take up such a large chunk of the book?     * the whole draccus sequence, while cool, is just a side trip without really adding anything to the plot or to the growth of the characters  - and it added a lot of unnecessary length to the book    In short - I find Rothfuss to be a promising writer - but a very wordy one. This book could have been a lot better with a ruthless editor willing to cut out some of the tangenital side stories and cut back on a lot of the repetitous stuff both in the street orphan sequence and once the main character gets to the university. (Yes, he is poor. I get it . And get it again. And get itagain. And get it again. Rinse and repeat.)    With Rothfuss being such a new writer I blame the editor more than the writer for the problems I have with the book.    I will most certainly read the next book in the trilogy. But I will not be dropping everything in my life to do so on its release day, as I would do with some other writers in the genre.
B000YMBBH0|1.0|We love the Bourne series.  However we are not quite current with our DVD technology, so Standard format is all we can view.  The main title for this trilogy is dual format, but the older titles are HD-DVD only, which makes them unwatchable for us.
0439882826|5.0|This was purchased for our eight and three year old sons, both of whom love Star Wars. It's a beautiful book and a great collectors item for any Star Wars fan, young or old.  I am trying to keep it out of reach of my three year old, however.  It's fragile enough to require supervision when he looks at it.  It's not your basic preschool pop-up book.

0060763280|5.0|This book is the foundation of building wealth. There is no doubt that we all have a financial blueprint. T. Harv presents the material in a completely logical manner. This book is about the psycology of wealth building, for people who want to set their mind to wealth building, keep wealth, and keep growing wealth. Very powerful book. I particularly like his comparisson of \\"declarations\\" to \\"affirmations\\" - he is right on the money. This is not a book that will tell one how to build a business, where to buy supplies for the business and how to hire employees. It will teach one how to think successfuly and how to set one's mind frame to succedd in any business one undertakes. Too many people work their hinies of, practice their affirmations every day, and never seem to succeed because something always happens. This book will reset one's financial blueprint to succeed.
B000005RTG|5.0|I have to admit that I have discover this album only recently, I know Deep Purple since the early 70's.  In Rock was one of my first record that I bought when I was a kid (you remember the vinyl ?)and later on I bought Machine Head, Made in Japan and so on, but I didn't pay attention to this one because two many original members were missing, to me, it was not Deep Purple and I didn't even listen to it...that was my mistake.  It is a very different sound, but hey, this cd is really good. Every songs is a pleasure to listen to. If like me, you didn't pay attention to this one, you should give it a try, you'll discover a damn hot good rock album.
B000W0DFDM|4.0|The book is on the comical side; however, I have to say that Greg's advise is sooo right on. There is a whole segment of women out there with very low self esteem who atract the losers that treat them badly. Liz, the co-author, is the perfect example; she seems to be a basket case, always going somewhat against Greg's simple and to the point advice. No wonder she is 41 and single. It is really quite simple, LISTEN to your feelings. If you feel disapointed, and making up any excuse for the guy you are dating, he is not worth your time - get out now because it will only get worse. Leave the path open for the guy who will make you feel like a million bucks. The only advise lacking in this book is for those abused women to seek out counseling. In order to attract a healthy relationship one has to be healthy emotionaly first.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I often watch movies, good, bad, I just want to kill time after supper or after sports before. But I haven't met a lot of good movies yet, in fact, zero, in my mind. To me the worst book I've ever read is better than the best movie I've watched. When I browse the Amazon bestseller list, I skip the movie category no matter what is hot in it. I was totally disappointed with these Hollywood potboilers. I hate wasting time in selecting-watching-being-disappointed format. I love music, I spend a lot of time on Amazon music section. As far as I can tell, since last summer, Once has been always in top 100, maybe top 50. But I didn't even try the sample, because I've never heard of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.    Yesterday, when I'm doing my routine browse on Amazon, the CD finally caught my eye. I clicked the link then found it was the music from the movie Once. I listened to the samples, then decided to watch the indie(though only 4.5 stars on Amazon, but the samples from OST added another .5). It's only 86 minutes, It won't take a long time.    I didn't budge an inch on my chair during the movie, even the credits began to roll. I couldn't even believe when It ended. How can it end so fast, what's next? The movie is just incredibly beautiful, I know that foreign movies are much better than Hollywood's(Whale Rider, Pan's Labyrinth, the Sea Inside), this one is another find in 2007, I just don't know how to simplify my feelings.    The story is simple, the friendship and chemistry between two main characters are convincing and touching, the performance was down-to-earth, no exaggeration, no special-effect of course, but full of warmness and sincerity. The music is passionate and delighting. So what else do you want for a movie about real life? Conspiracy? Ghost? Exploit?    Please, drop everything and see this great movie.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|I like this movie as much now as I did when it came out in 1983.  If you've never watched the movie then you should probably start with the US Theatrical Release since it explains the story line in more detail.  If you've seen the movie, watch the Final Directors Cut by Ridley Scott.  Remember that prior to Blade Runner every futuristic Sci-Fi movie had people in white jumpsuits living in a sterile hospital-like environments.  This was the first film to show the future the way is will unfortunately be: acid rain, polution, advertising everywhere and just plain dirty.  If you only buy one movie, this should be the one.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|While I can't speak for all those cable shows, I know for a fact that LOST is by far the best show on network TV, (with Heroes coming in close second). Watching a season of LOST all the way through on DVD is like reading a really long, exciting, mystery novel, and Season 3 is no different.<br /><br />Some people claim that the begining of this season drags on, but I have to disagree. Those first six episodes are packed full of action, drama, philosophy, interesing new characters, and all the other staples that LOST is known for. And if you're one of those people that complain about the show not giving enough answers, you will be pleasantly surprised by season 3.<br /><br />Another great thing about this show is how radically different each season is. Season 1 could be seen as Man VS Nature, season 2 could be seen as Man VS Machine, and season 3 (with its extensive investigation into the world of The Others) could be seen as Man VS Self.<br /><br />Season 3 also has a few episodes that aren't up to par with most of the others (The Glass Ballerina, Stranger in a Strange Land, Expose), but even those are better than just about anything else you'll see on network TV.<br /><br />LOST looks like a movie, with its widescreen HD format, spectacular locales, and production values. The acting is mostly top-notch as well; Terry O-Quinn (John Locke) and Michael Emerson (the Other formerly known as Henry Gale) are mezmerizing to watch, and most definetly deserve the acting awards they were nominated for.  Even Matthew Fox (Jack) comes into his own in season 3, delivering a very powerful performance in the season finale.<br /><br />Season 3 also has some of the greatest episodes in LOST history. A Tale of Two Cities, Flashes Before Your Eyes, Enter 77, The Man From Tallehasse, The Brig, The Man Behind the Curtain, and Greatest Hits have raised the bar considerably. And by the way, Through the Looking Glass is one of the best season finales I have ever seen, and is definetly my favorite LOST episode to date. Can't wait for Season 4!!!!<br /><br />As for the DVD extras and all that, they pale in comparison to how good the show itself really is. If you don't buy all three seasons of LOST on DVD, I beg you to at least go rent them (start at Season 1). I promise, unless you're one of those people that doesn't like to think, you will love this show. And if you're a fan of Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Heroes, Battlestar Galactica, or sci-fi and mystery in general, then what the hell are you waiting for???<br /><br />PS: If you have a BluRay player, get the LOST BlueRay disc set. You will not be dissapointed!for Season 4!!!!    As for the DVD extras and all that, they pale in comparison to how good the show itself really is.

0694526088|5.0|The material presented from Jim Collins is profoundly well organized and based on REAL research and information.  He is very candid about what the facts do and don't support.  This \\"book\\" is not a blah, blah, blah management THEORY based on the THEORY about THEORY.  Jim's dissertation is based on facts, and the how those facts apply to useful truth.  In this regard, I believe Good to Great presents a very solid body of information beneficial to anyone interested in doing better buisiness.  And, it's very enjoyable too.

B000E5KJE8|5.0|What can I say in this short review that has't already been said better by others on the merits of Denzel Washington's performance in this movie? This was one of those rare Academy Award Wins that was actually deserved. That being said, let's discuss the HD version specifically.    To begin with the most important feature, the video transfer; absolutely outstanding! The level of detail on the car interior, Denzels leather jacket, textures and depth give a real 3d sense to the transfer! I give this one VERY high marks visually. I've used this one as a demo disc for a few non HD savvy friends that are not sci-fi fans ( non Transformer or Matrix people)that wanted to see something a bit more reality based and they all were suitably impressed.    The Audio... heck it comes with a TrueHD mix; game over! It sounds great. The bonus features have a few very interesting cut scenes that give a bit more insight into Alonzo's character ( I DO wish they were in better quality). The directors commentary was pretty good also.     All in All, I have to give this HD high marks, I highly recommend it over the BLU Ray version but don't take my word for it [...] . With Warner going over to Blu exclusively I suggest those that have both formats go \\"red\\" on this one.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|You can't miss.  It starts out slow but I came to appreciate the director's attention to wonderfully placed details and a pacing that leads the viewer to a rising tempo and a super finale.  Ferrell and his sometimes juvenille comedies must now take a backseat to something of value.  The selfless courage of the doomed man and the strength and determination of the distraught woman; this story offers a message that hits home and gets you there with some laughs and style that the list of recent releases lack.  Hoffman's recent efforts usually are lame and cliche, but he's quite good in this role.  This is Ferrell's best work (period and no debate) and Emma Thompson, a favorite of mine, is fantastic...again.  This is one you need to own.

B000VKW7AK|5.0|I have all the U.S. versions of every single Megadeth record. Plus a few of the international versions with bonus tracks. Still, I have to confess. I was motivated to buy it because of the fantastic art work and the DVD.<br />The warchest set includes all those rare songs, plus those songs released in soundtracks and many others never realeased before. The DVD is a jewel for any Megadeth fan. Great sound quality, great songs. Also, the fourth CD is a live concert. My favorite because it includes songs I've never heard before LIVE. (Black Friday, Skull Beneath the Skin, Take no Prisoners and Lucretia).

B000Y7U98C|3.0|When humanity's limits of scientific understanding reach our periphery of comprehension, we turn to our artists to show us images that could not possibly be seen and sometimes these artists are inspired and seek to push \\"beyond\\" and give us glimpses to the other side of comprehension.<br /><br />2001 and Solaris are movies that Sunshine reminded me of in their attempts to show the audience more.  In my mind Kubrick's 2001 is astonishing in what it told of us as humanity.  Solaris (as Clooney portrayed it) on the other hand was Art at its highest form.  Sunshine sits sits somewhere between both of these films.<br /><br />This movie is neither science fiction nor fantasy.  More, the setting is a forum for the writer/producer/director to tell us about our humanity, limitations, mortality, religion, purpose and our quest for God.But what were they trying to tell me?  how we burden so few with the responsibility for all of us?  That's the question I'm left with after seeing this movie.  In time, maybe a consensus will appear.<br /><br />This is not Science Fiction: the sun dying in 50 years? impossible.  Artificial Gravity without centrifuges in 50 years? not without a couple of Einsteins coming up with something pronto. An atomic bomb to restart something as sun? impossible.  So what is this genre? I call it Fanciful Science Fiction.<br /><br />Where Solaris was a very smooth 22year single malt, sunshine is Raw Whiskey (it has potential but it might need 20 years of aging for us to fully appreciate it).<br /><br />Will you like it?  If you want action, there is some in this movie but probably not enough to fully entertain.  If you want pure art, there is some but probably not enough to fully entertain you.  If you want \\"Insight\\" like you get from Kubrick, there is potential here but not enough to really get your philosophical juices going without aging this.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is slow.  We're asked to suspend disbelief and accept stupendous errors in judgement from the crew.  If the reward is an action packed rollicking adventure like Star Wars: Fantastic!!  If the reward is a gorefest and prelude to Warhammer like Event Horizon: Fantastic!! If the story is woven tight and the reward is a Terror like Alien: Fantastic!!  If the reward is something of pure artistic harmony and beauty like Solaris: Fantastic!!  If the reward is metaphysical insight into our humanity like 2001: Fantastic!!  Overall, I felt that I suspended disbelief much much less in Star Wars, Alien, 2001, Event Horizon and Solaris and in my belief I was rewarded with much more.<br /><br />Unfortunately and without aging, this movie doesn't provide enough metaphysical umph yet for the audience to accept the scientific errors, gross omissions, and gross oversight by the crew.  The special effects were good but when you have the Sun as your canvas - its hard to get wrong.  Overall they were good but nothing like Star Wars or movies of that caliber but was pretty.  This is a fantastic B movie though.  I give it 3.5 stars for raw potential.  If you don't like science fiction - stay away.<br /><br />Easy for me to critique -- but there was allot of effort put into this work.  Thank you!acked rollicking adventure like Star Wars: Fantastic!!  If the reward is a gorefest and prelude to Warhammer like Event Horizon: Fantastic!!

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I've had the Swivel Sweeper for about 3 months. I have had no problems with it or the batteries. I find it to be very convenient to use. I have read extensively about the problems that others have had so I was wary about getting one.     I bought my sister one for Christmas and she loves it.    It's great on wood floors and ceramic tile. I don't think it would be as effective on rugs - since it is just a sweeper - not a vacuum, and the load on the motor due to the drag on the carpet would likely discharge the battery pack very quickly.    In regard to the battery issues, the Company appears to have a quality control problem since they probably use the cheapest NiMH batteries available to maximize their margins. So, it could be hit or miss - you get a good set of batteries in the pack or you don't. There are six C batteries in the battery pack (which can't be opened) - if they are not matched properly, the pack won't last because the higher voltage batteries will discharge into the lower voltage batteries.    Also, the battery charger is not microprocessor controlled which gives the capability to monitor the battery temperature and voltage and thus control the rate of charge to minimize battery temperature. The charger only charges at a constant rate instead of switching to a trickle charge when the charge nears completion to reduce the battery temperature which preserves battery life. Heat is worst enemy for batteries. This is why you shouldn't keep the battery pack in the charger for more than 5 or 6 hours (less time if the battery wasn't completely discharged).    Also, remove the battery pack physically from the charger when not charging - otherwise the charger will discharge the battery.    It would have been nice if the Company gave the provision to replace the C batteries in the battery pack. In that way, a higher quality battery could be purchased from other sources.    It would have also been nice if the Company provided an option to purchase one of those microprocessor controlled fast chargers that charge the battery in two hours and then go into trickle charge to keep the battery topped off - then one wouldn't have to worry about overcharging. You can purchase these chargers for about $10.    When my battery pack fails, I will likely cut open the pack (which is not easy to do) and replace the batteries with high quality C NiMH which you can find readily in Radio Shack or on the Web (e.g., greenbatteries.com).  And, maybe even adapt the battery charger to a microprocessor based fast charger.    All in all, the product is a good idea and works fairly well for the price. But, I feel that there should be other options that allow the customer to buy up so to speak.    Note, you are better off buying the Swivel Sweeper from the many dealers on ebay - it's cheaper ($25) - that's what I did.

B000ETQR3Q|4.0|My 10yo son wanted only this toy for Christmas and boy has it received daily use since!  So far nothing has broken on it (like on other Nerf guns) and he enjoys the versatility of the two guns and the scope, which happens to fit on his other Nerf gun.  The only drawback was that it came with only 10 darts -- you really need to spend the extra on more darts because these things get lost easily.  This is a pure fun toy, no educational value whatsover other than maybe allowing my child to use his very active imagination.

0316010669|5.0|This book is one among a number of recent volumes which speak to quirks in human decision-making.  Each emphasizes that our brains are not ideally constructed to make rational decisions; some of these argue that rational decision-making may not be as effective as many think; some argue that the use of quick and frugal \\"rules of thumb\\" are (or are not) pretty effective.  Works addressing such issues include: Tavris and Aronson, Mistakes Were Made (But not by Me); Gilovich et al., Heuristics and Biases; Fine, A Mind of Its Own; Gigerenzer, Gut Feelings; Linden, The Accidental Mind.  And now \\"Blink,\\" by Malcolm Gladwell (author of the best seller \\"The Tipping Point\\").<br /><br />The book begins with a vignette, focusing on the Getty Museum being offered the chance to purchase a particular work.  The Museum used scientific methods to try to determine if the object was legit--or a phony.  They decided that it was good and purchased it.  However, a handful of experts, after just a quick glance at the object, concluded that it was a fraud.  Later research agreed with those snap decisions.<br /><br />This illustrates a key point made by Gladwell: Sometimes quick and dirty decision making is actually better in terms of outcomes than agonizing efforts at rational analysis. He points out that this is what evolutionary cognitive expert Gerd Gigerenzer calls \\"fast and frugal\\" decision making.<br /><br />A number of examples are used to illustrate how well \\"thin slice\\" decision-making can work.  In a war game, one side (the Red Team) used \\"out of the box\\" thinking against the other side (The Blue Team), which represented the United States.  The latter team used rational decision making efforts, did after action analysis at each step, and tried, in short, to use \\"best practices.\\"  The leader of the Red Team worked more by \\"feel,\\" allowing his subordinates to take initiative on their own.  End result?  The United States was defeated!  Gladwell's conclusion is that thin slice, fast and frugal decision making was more effective.<br /><br />He adduces any number of examples as to why quick decision making works better than rational analysis. This is firmly in the tradition of Gigerenzer and his collaborators, extolling the virtues of fast and frugal heuristics (decision making shortcuts).<br /><br />However, Gladwell understands that there is also a darker side to this thin slice decision making.  Stereotypes can end up guiding decision making.  He wonders if this explains the disproportionate number of African-Americans who are imprisoned, if this explains why some people get better deals in negotiation with auto dealers than others, if this is why Amadou Diallo dies in a hail of gunfire from police in the Bronx.  And this is the side of decision making shortcuts that Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and their colleagues address (see the volume earlier mentioned edited by Gilovich et al).<br /><br />The final chapter is Gladwell's effort to somehow encourage the positive payoffs of the use of these quick and dirty decision making processes while minimizing the negative consequences. Convincing?  I'm not so sure, but the author surely makes us think about these issues.  A very well done book.ng was more effective.

1579126227|5.0|\\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles\\" was Agatha Christie's first mystery novel, in which she introduced her enigmatic and eccentric Belgium detective, Hercule Poirot.  She often later lamented that she should have made Poirot younger to begin with as he was to be the star detective in many of her mysteries afterward.  But her retired police officer began his magnificent orbit with this intriguing mystery full of the twists and turns that would soon become Christie's trademark.<br /><br />Wounded at the Western front, Captain Hastings is invalided home and has a chance encounter with his old friend John Cavendish.  John invites him to his family's estate for a visit, which Hastings gladly accepts.  But Styles, the family's home, is hardly full of happy characters.  Both sons are disturbed by their stepmother's behavior - for she has married Alfred Inglethorp, a man twenty years younger than she.  Almost everyone is convinced that he is solely after her money and when Mrs. Inglethorp dies suddenly one night of strychnine poisoning, her husband is the immediate suspect.  But there are others within the household who would have benefitted from the old lady's death, especially when a fragment of a freshly written will is found burned in her bedchamber.  Could someone within her own family have cleverly carried out her murder?  Only Hercule Poirot can find all the missing pieces to solve this puzzler of a crime.<br /><br />Agatha Christie's name is forever cemented in the echelons of mystery writers, and with good reason.  Her varied background helped to make her a near expert in matters of poisons, which have played an important role in many of her novels, and her travels to exotic locales have created heightened settings for some of her best mysteries.  Her first novel must certainly have been a tough act to follow with its quick pace and plot twists; it fails only at times through its slightly weak narration by Captain Hastings.  \\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles\\" introduced the world to Agatha Christie, and readers have never looked for better, returning time and again to each mystery she ingeniously crafted.Agatha Christie, and readers have never looked for better, returning time and again to each mystery she ingeniously crafted.

1577314808|5.0|I have been in The Rosicrucian Order (Ancient & Mystical Order of Rosae Crusis) since I was 18 yrs old. This is a course in self-development and mystical techniques to ultimately aquire Self-Mastery. My studies have lead me to the finding of this book, and putting aside all prior opinions and beliefs; The Power of Now is all we ever really need to read to find enlightenment in an instant. It is one of the most fantastic books that I have ever read in my life and it has the answer to all we ever need in a nutshell. Eckhart Tolle talks of the illusions and constraints of time that hold us back in an artificially created outer self and that as soon as this is mearly just recognised, our lives become transformed from there onwards. There is never any other power than the power we have RIGHT NOW. This is the power of true Being and in this wave is where all we need is accessed. Anxieties, depression, illnesses, money problems can all be transformed as soon as we realise this illusionary sense of time that is our limit. A wonderful book, a transformative power and a must have within it's own enlightening egregore. A book that can and should be read over and over again until we are fully living in the NOW.

The re-mastered audio tracks are exceptional. Song selection would of been difficult-but not to worry if your favorite track was left off this CD - Jimmy Page (he learned well from the late great Peter Grant) is an exceptional marketer, so I predict there will be more \\"special packages\\" in the future. I bought my Zep CD/DVD  (from Amazon of course) - and I really enjoy all of it. Even if you own previous released Zep material, I encourage you to check out this new Led Zeppelin product. A great value for sure!
0761119752|5.0|I LOVE this book!  And isn't that what REALLY makes us buy books for our kids?  I've certainly read (and re-read) books that I'm not fond of b/c my son loves them but, like most parents, I try to avoid that at all costs!    This is an adorable book that we all love to read and listen to!  The writing is playful but not \\"dumb.\\"  The rhymes all work and the pictures are fun!      My 3yo has this book (and MANY other Sandra Boynton books) memorized and most nights he reads it to us instead of the other way around!  We like to do our own special little actions along with the story and make some pretty big n silly inflections!    I would recommend this for every night time routine! :D
9562911640|5.0|Rhonda Byrne's \\"The Secret\\" may be the book du jour among the self help / get rich quick crowd, but Charles Haanel's \\"The Master Ket System\\"...first published as a correspondence course in 1912, then in a single volume in 1917...is the real deal.    My exposure to the book came through its inclusion in [[ASIN:1585426148 The Prosperity Bible: Landmark Writings on the Incredible Prospering Powers of the Human Mind]], and the foreword immediately lays the groundwork:    \\"The student who learns that power comes from within, that he is weak only because he has depended on help from the outside, and who unhesitatingly throws himself on his own thought, instantly rights himself, stands erect, assumes dominant attitude, and works miracles.\\"    A large part of what's wrong with modern \\"self help\\" works is that they exist primarily to set you up as an ongoing customer, to sell you more product, more books, more CDs, more \\"success journals,\\" anything and everything that the author can slap his or her name onto.    The Master Key System is built on a single, powerful premise: That the world you see around you is created by you in the world inside of you. It's all manifestation, and to add another modern buzz word, \\"The Law Of Attraction.\\"    Haanel refers to the system as a science, and it he certainly approaches the subject from that standpoint. The key points are largely set up as scientific / mathematical arguments in which A + B = C...you witness the progression of his argument and are hard pressed to find flaws in it.    If you like little soundbites...if you like \\"gift books\\" or \\"coffee table books\\" packed with scenic photos of crashing waves and majestic landscapes and encouraging \\"power thoughts\\" like \\"SEE your future...BE your future..,\\" this might not be the book for you.    As another reviewer pointed out, Haanel \\"could have\\" given you a Cliffs Notes version of this book, but he chose not to do that. In \\"The Prosperity Bible,\\" the book runs 136 pages, but these are large pages with small type. I've seen a paperback edition that's 484 pages in length. The book goes to great lengths to assert, and then re-assert, its authority on the subject of \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" things happen. You can't get that from a pamphlet. Be patient, take your time, read the whole thing from front to back. You'll be glad you did.    Haanel writes \\"We cannot express powers that we do not possess. The only way by which we may secure possession of power is to become conscious of power, and we can never become conscious of power until we learn that all power is from within.\\"    I highly recommend this book, but only if you're willing to invest the time and effort required to use it as an agent of change in your life.
B00104W8T6|5.0|There is nothing better than staying up listening to the best newly-acquired CD.   If you haven't heard it yet, give Juno Soundtrack a listen. It's outstanding! Not since The Garden State Soundtrack has there been such an entertaining movie album.      Pay special attention to the words in the original material, particularly \\"Loose Lips\\" by Kimya Dawson. But don't ignore \\"the oldies\\" by The Velvet Underground and Belle & Sebastian.    For those who have seen the movie, the soundtrack will bring up warm memories of captivating scenes (especially the last song, which is the movie duet between Michael Cera and Ellen Page); for those, who haven't seen the movie yet - what are you waiting for?
B000YA82F6|5.0|It starts as one of those everyday dramas, a teenage girl finds herself pregnant. Her first thought is to end the pregnancy but, when the time comes, she shies and bolts from the clinic for no rational reason. Instead, she decides to bring the baby to term and find a good home for it.<br /><br />Even when she's as big as \\"a planet\\" (and equally inhabited), Juno keeps her sassy attitude and sarcastic humor. Her character, played wonderfully well by Ellen Page, carries the movie with her one-liners and attitude. Like the other characters, Juno comes across as complex and believable, fragile and resilient at the same time. Her social world seems true too, almost a closed society of teenagers with incidental and often uncomfortable interactions with the adults.<br /><br />This might be the most improbable feel-good movie ever. In fact that would be the one criticism I'd offer, that it seems a bit more \\"cleaned up\\" than I'd expect many lives to be. The teenagers are goofy, gawky, and uncertain, but never show the vicious edge that comes out way too frequently. Her whole world is largely supportive, or at least benign. I don't wish a pregnancy on any teenager, but I'd wish that kind of support for any who do end up as mommy-to-be, the kind of support that too few girls in trouble seem to get. That happy background keeps makes the comedy possible, and the edgy humor makes this movie succeed.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
0143038419|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  And what makes it so wonderful is Elizabeth Gilbert's clear, witty, intelligent, honest voice.  She's a treasure and I look forward to reading her next piece.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth's latest offering titled `Ghost Reveries' is another solid effort by the Swedish quintet.  Thankfully for most fans, the band returned to their progressive/death metal sound as opposed to 2003's release titled Damnation.  Ghost Reveries was released in Fall of 2005 and was also the bands first release on their new label, RoadRunner.  Mikael Åkerfeldt is a genius of a musician and the rest of his band mates perform very well.<br /><br />The opening track features some soft chords before unleashing very heavy riffs and death metal growls.  Worries about the new label having a watered-down effect on Opeth are quickly dismissed and the song features over 10 minutes of many twists and turns.  The Baying of the Hounds is just a great title for a song.  Atonement is very hypnotic in a way, and a beautiful song.  Reverie/Harlequin Forest is one of the best songs on the album and is also very diverse.  The Grand Conjuration features some of the best growls from Åkerfeldt.  Isolation Years is a beautiful ending to the album.<br /><br />While Ghost Reveries will certainly not be the bands last offering, longtime drummer Martin Lopez did leave the band shortly after the recording due to health reasons.  Also, in late 2007, longtime guitarist Peter Lindgren also left the band after 16 years due to personal reasons.  Lopez was replaced by former Witchery drummer Martin `Axe' Axenrot, and Lindgren was replaced by Fredrik Åkesson, who has also played with Arch Enemy.  Opeth are looking to the future and will have a new album out in 2008.  Opeth are one of the best metal bands within the genre.
B000TSUCAQ|5.0|Daughter purchased as gift for friend (star war junkie).  Delivery on time and in great shape.  Informed of status automatically by seller.  Would purchase products again.  Friend was very pleased.  Thank You
B00005Y6YB|4.0|I've been a fan of this western since it originally came out. If you want to see a good western with great actors, then I highly recommend this one.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Last minute purchase as gift for my daughter.  Delivery on time and in great condition. She spends many hours between flights on layovers (flight attendant)and this is her favorite show.  Along with the portable DVD player (also pink)that she received, she was thrilled with the gifts.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|A must have for any horror/zombie fan. The social commentary of Romero is timeless. You will cringe one minute and laugh the next..sometimes even at the same time. The film pokes fun at our highly materialized culture as well as the lack of cooperation between different groups of people trying to survive the horrible ordeal. \\"When the dead walk, senores, we must stop the killing...or lose the war\\".
B000M5AJQS|1.0|I just kept waiting for this movie to be over.  It was agonizingly long, there were no redeeming characters, and shooting everyone in the movie in the head got a little repetitive.  This is an excellent example of how just because you have big names involved in the movie, it doesn't automatically make the movie good.  I wish I could have those fwe hours I wasted watching this movie back.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Disclaimer:  I have never seen the earlier versions of this, so I am not going to do a comparison of any kind.<br />If you try to take it too seriously, you  will miss out on all the fun!<br />A friend and I saw it and we were laughing like crazy most of the time, but that's because we were responding to the outrageous, over-the-top scenes of Sweeney slicing away while singing lovely songs.  Johnny Depp shows some vocal skill here, as do Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and others.  Not beautiful or really professional singing voices, but they have a great deal of character and emotion and that's what counts in this case.<br />  Burton and the cinematographer do a bloody good job of showing the red fluid as the only real color in the film except for Lovett's fantasy scene; the rest of London is dark, dirty, dank and foul; the sun never really comes out.  Obviously this is also meant to be metaphorical.<br />  Be aware that this is not a good choice for preteen girls no matter how Depp-crazed they may be.  A movie featuring a deadly barber with a razor and a demented woman with a meat grinder for human prey is not appropriate viewing, in my opinion, for those under 14.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat all the way through.  I wasn't sure what to expect going into it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was wonderfully done.  The acting was superb, and I found the premise (a world where no one has had a baby in ~20 years) truly scary.  The portrayal of a sort of post apocalyptal world seemed completely believable which is what made the movie so scary.  All in all, this movie is a must see.
0375703764|4.0|I got this book because I his sister's album is my all-time favorite, Haunted by Poe.  I didn't expect it to be under \\"horror.\\" It took about two weeks to read.  It's not an easy read because of all tangents.    It wasn't easy to explain to my family:  I'm reading a book about a guy who's writing a book from the notes of an old blind man about a documentary about a strange house.  \\"What's new in the house?\\" I can't tell you because I've just spent the last hour reading about this guy's personal life and then an academic essay about mythology.  I did like the characters, even unlikeable, at least I felt for them.  There were jokes, there was emotion, it was just messed up.  Certain things about the book were frustrating, like the fake references.  I felt like I was learning something, except maybe it's not true.  I hated the pages with one word on them, what a waste of time and paper.  I feel compelled to go back and write cryptic messages on them.  I loved Tom's jokes about perception.
B000WQW988|5.0|I bought this dvd for my teenage daughter, who has become a Nirvana fan over the last year. She was ecstatic to get this as a present. We watched some of it together and I was surprised to find myself really enjoying it as well. It is hard to watch knowing what happened to Kurt Cobain, but the accoustic performances are great and the commentaries in the special feature section were very interesting, too.
B000W07EKW|5.0|Great action packed movie collection. Each one of the movies kept you on the edge of your seat.
B00000DHTF|5.0|For true Springsteen fans, some of the songs on this massive 4 cd set are better than their released counterparts. Springsteen himself has played several of the songs found here in concert over the years, and many will be recognizable to the fan of his live shows. This collection for me proved the \\"Born in the USA\\" period could have been truly great had he included many of the songs from cd 3, and just made another double album, like The River. But more importantly, this collection proves it is Springsteen and not Dylan, who will be remembered as Pop's greatest American songwriter.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|Well, I was skeptikal, and no this is a real person and not some dude that works for the company or a company involved in the release of this product, im real indeed. So yeah, I was skeptikal. Usually, trilogy packages leave out special features and such, so thats the norm im used to. This trilogy package however was everything and more you would want from the 3 movies that reinvented the cathphrase man of steel. I think the last movie sucks, but thats just me. The first 2 are good, and the robocop classy cheesyness that only they could pull off and still be a viable good movie stays intant. OCP baby! For Life! 2 Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! Buy this, if you like robo, cuz its as good as it gets.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Having not watched this movie in almost 10 years I was excited to see how it would look in Blu-ray.      I wasn't disappointed.  Maybe it's just me but I get a kick out of watching movies that claim to be made in the old style of film making.  This movie is great to watch in High Def because it almost draws out the old style filming tricks (if you know where to look for them).    The transfer to Blu-ray is really great.  Color pops where it is supposed to and blacks are just that, black.    The extras are all in high def which is a huge plus.    It was fun to relive the (almost) cheesy acting of all involved.  If you don't have this movie in your collection and you have a Blu-ray player I would totally recommend you get this.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|I will start by saying that you need to listen to these 3 cds on headphones(GOOD ones) to really appreciate what has been achieved with the release of these 3 fine cds. DO NOT believe what you read in some of the reviews - the music is timeless , stunning and something that Vangelis can be proud of. It gets my full 5 star rating from beginning to end - the new tracks on cd 3 are outstanding and follow the mood of the original soundtrack release as on the remastered cd 1. Worth every dollar indeed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Purchased as a gift for Christmas. Excellent quality. Recipient very pleased. If you loved the series on tv, you will love this set!
0316067598|5.0|A book I could not put down. Any one who doesn't believe what we are doing in Iraq is the right thing should read this book. What these Navy Seals go through is unbelievable. Their training is superb and they give it all for our country. Very touching!!
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book.  I laughted and cried through out and could not put it down.  I especially loved reading about Gilbert's experiences in Indonesia.  I wish I could take this trip and discover myself as she did!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He loves to watch history movies, documentaries and wildlife movies.  He LOVED it and the whole family has watched it together.  Great item for anyone who loves our Planet Earth.  Magnificent!
B000050FEN|4.0|I received my Se7en (New Line Platinum Series) DVD and it didn't dissapoint. Just the package is great, and the movie is amazing. Great for any David Fincher fan (like me)!
B0000DBJDM|4.0|Floyd always good   but  rather seen them  play  more  than talk .
0375413405|5.0|For those who wish to venture into the world of culinary genius, Mastering the Art of French Cooking is the Bible. Specific, thorough, and accurate recipes guide even the novice to achieving gastronomic perfection. This is the first serious cookbook I owned as a young housewife. Now, I purchase the book for every serious cook. Simply a must have!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Danny Boyle was the reason I watched this movie. \\"28 Days Later\\" was one of the best nontraditional horror thrillers I'ev seen in years, and he's accomplished the same thing now for the science fiction genre. With Earth's sun dying, a group of astronauts and scientists pilots a spacecraft with a vital cargo -- an explosive device powerful enough (they hope) to reignite the star. Boyle glosses over a lot of the science in this film, but that's okay. The characterization and the suspense are strong enough to propel this movie along to a truly powerful climax.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This album has made a Rufus Wainwright fan out of me.  Now I own all his albums and have purchased tickets for the show at Radio City Music Hall on Valentine's day for me and my boyfriend.  We're taking a limo from Baltimore all the way up - talk about a romantic night!  A limo ride to Radio City Music Hall, a Rufus Wainwright concert.... I don't think even TOOL would be as perfect - for Valentine's day, that is.  Having the most amazing gay artist perform for myself and my boyfriend on Valentine's day, with such talent,...it will be a hard Valentine's day to top.
B000SZLSB2|3.0|Never having paid much attention to titles..I will now!  This CD is quite good--musically and Blunt's voice is excellent.,  It is filled with sadness and depressing feelings.  This young man does a great job in delivering, but one cannot listen long.  A CD such as this really brings one down, and most of us need entertaining vibes that will spark our day.  I would not buy this CD nor recommend it
B0002SG1OY|4.0|Just as with many other Kinks albums that have somehow fallen through the cracks, this album is packed full of greats songs and this reissue reveals the details in an album that I'm sure has influenced a lot of musicians (and recording engineers!) over the years. Here's the correct track list for this remastered edition - lots of singles and bonus tracks make this version worth getting over the 12-track versions:    1. Victoria  2. Yes Sir No Sir  3. Some Mother's Son  4. Drivin'  5. Brainwashed  6. Australia  7. Shangri-la  8. Mr Churchill Says  9. She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina  10. Young And Innocent Days  11. Nothing To Say  12. Arthur  13. Plastic Man  14. King Kong  15. Drivin'  16. Mindless Child Of Motherhood  17. This Man He Weeps Tonight  18. Plastic Man  19. Mindless Child Of Motherhood  20. This Man He Weeps Tonight  21. She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina  22. Mr Shoemaker's Daughter
B000OVLBGC|5.0|An excellent movie showing that the heart beats even in the darkest most bureaucratic portions of the populace.
B00030DEQE|5.0|I got this NIC around the holidays because one of my desktop's onboard NIC was acting funny.  So I purchased a few, and after I installed it into my desktops, it worked immediately. The computers are all dual boot workstations with Windows XP Pro and Kubuntu 7.04, and all computers worked with both OSs right away.  However, I chose to install current drivers to get full access.  It works well with my gigabit switch, where the limitation is due only to other computers with 10/100 NIC.  Because I am used to comps with 10/100 cards, I see a significant difference in transfer rate between computers with this card installed!<br /><br />Pros: Great performance, ease of installation, supports a great variety of operating systems, support for Gigabit.<br /><br />Cons: Could be cheaper.
0143038419|5.0|of course this book is great.  i purchased three to give out as gifts for christmas.  they're loving it!
B000QCUB8I|4.0|i know, i know, you're thinking: christian music != suck, that's impossible. but apparently god let this one slip by.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|Alice Sebold was raped during her freshman year in college.  One can think of this as just a statistic because, undoubtedly, a great many eighteen year old girls are raped.  But the author expertly describes how this event affected her.  One might think this solitary event is (hopefully) followed by a singular period of recovery, albeit perhaps a very long period of recovery.  I've learned from 'Lucky' that this simply isn't true.  One's psyche/soul takes a windy, unpredictable path after experiencing such brutal trauma.  Alice Sebold describes her path very clearly.  Tough reading, but I think this is perhaps the best memoir of this sort I've ever read.      Bottom line: although the subject matter is likely to turn off prospective readers I suggest 'Lucky' be required reading by all.
032147404X|5.0|I have applied several of the tips and techniques to my photographs since reading this book and found them to be well worth the nominal purchase price.  Example: Chapter 9 - Shoot the Details.  Rather than trying to capture too much of one large thing, I have used this tip and been rewarded with a more powerful photo.  And in Chapter 4: Where to put the Horizon Line AND Object Placement (found in Chapter 11) -- simple, yet effective ideas for better pictures.  Actually pretty much common sense suggestions, but generally not practiced by the amateur/weekend shooter (me).  I have read many reviews where people rip on Kelby's quirky sense of humor; sometimes I agree.  Most of it I read through and obtained the bulk of the information and put it to good use.  You will not be disappointed with your purchase.  Highly recommended.  Volume 2 is out now and I will likely purchase that as well.
B000VWYJ8Q|1.0|Received the HD DVD  Version which is not compatable with my TV's.  Would like to exchange for one that is compatable.  Thanks C.H. Auer
B0002NRQTS|5.0|WhIle I feel there are a few outstanding songs of great note on this CD and a few clunkers in my book...    Available Light is a stunning gem that is worth the price of the CD itself, perhaps even being one of their priceless songs.    It's a breathtaking, passionate and gorgeous song.  If you haven't heard it, or haven't heard it for a while, you should consider giving it a spin again and turning it way up.
0525950079|5.0|i was very concerned that this book would not arrive in time for christmas, because it was ordered kind of late. but, it arrived in plenty of time. great, great service!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Very imaginative.  Fun for the whole family, or in my case, for my husband and I.  The graphics are amazing and the story line is uplifting.  Give it 2 thumbs up.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A delightful animated film about gourmet cooking with an ambitious rat the star, showing that even the lowliest creatures can have good taste and creativity - at least in our imaginations.  It was fun, dramatic and charming.  All ages can enjoy the action and the story.
0393038912|1.0|It is hard to understand why this book won the pulitzer (though another reviewer points it out: only journalists give the awards -- not scientists, historians and others in relevant fields who could have pointed out flaws).    Readers would benefit from reading J.M.Blaut's criticisms of this book, in his Eight Eurocentric Historians. Also any other author that can discredit this eurocentric nonsense (though they likely won't get awards from the \\"establishement\\" I bet!)
B000I0RR76|5.0|This film is excellent, especially considering when it was produced.  The colors are beautiful; quite a nice HD film.  Recommended highly, especially if your looking for a clean, no bad language film.
B00081H018|5.0|This book is definitely a diversion from Kellerman's usual psych-thrillers. It has a slower pace, but is deeper and more intricate than many of his other novels.<br /><br />The character development is most excellent. I was interested from the start and remained riveted until the end. The plot keeps you guessing and trying to figure out 'who dunnit', and just when you think you have it, Kellerman takes you down a different road.<br /><br />I was thrilled with this book. It was unexpectedly good and very entertaining. For Christmas I gave it to two people who were also taken by it.
B0001YR5X0|5.0|I love this album, songs are softer and the lirics so poetic, is like Madonna's voice singing poetry, very good album, a must have for all Madonna's fans.
0439882826|4.0|I bought this product for my husband who is a huge Star Wars fan. Once opened it's entertainment for minutes. The pop-up pictures are plentiful and there are even pop-ups within pop-ups which really makes it fun. If you purchase it for a child, there could be hours of entertainment because the pop-ups are captivating, colorful, intricate and detail oriented. Very good book with very little words:) It's even got working light sabers!
B00006LSZ4|5.0|One of the very best anime movies of all times, I love the music, the way how they show the holiday doors on the trees and Jack impersonates Santa Claus without realizing that Christmas and Halloween are total oposites.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|this is an awesome cd, I bought it for my girlfriend for christmas, and she loves it
B00008S2VF|5.0|I think the cover of the album was the first thing that atracted me to this album, I love most of the songs, Madonna has done it one more time, she will always be the Queen of music.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Can't go wrong with this one... whether you're starting out with British comedy or know Fawlty Towers as a classic, it's a must-have addition to the DVD shelf. My boyfriend and I pull it out every now and then for a good evening laugh. Can watch it over and over again. Love it!
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|The final Bourne movie is just what you'd expect.  Great action, awesome car chase, and all the classic Bourne moves.  I thought the camera work was great.  Did you know that they actually had a guy jump off a building with the camera to capture the shot of Bourne jumping through the open window?  Some people don't like the shakiness of some scenes, but I thought it added to the fast-paced, hectic feel that a fight should have.  I wish I could get just an HD version instead of paying extra for the combo format, but oh well.  Overall, a great film and worth adding to the collection.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|I was in Helsinki for show #1 ! The guys were as good as when I saw them at GIANTS stadium on the invisible touch tour. Definetly one of the most memorable nights of my life.
0143038419|3.0|I loved the premise for this book and the idea of the various locations.  I also enjoyed Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style about 2/3 of the time.  I did not like her \\"asides\\" or interjections to the reader -those get very annoying and occur quite often.   I really enjoyed the first and third portions of the book, but the second part - in India - got so boring that I almost didn't finish reading it.  I even started part 3 and got halfway through that before I went back to finish the second part. As I read the section on India, it started to feel like a \\"how to\\" book on life in the Indian Ashram.  I felt her self-discovery in India could have been covered in about 30 pages.  Overall, I'd probably read another book by Gilbert to see how she has matured as a writer.
B000002QWD|5.0|I have always liked Bings Christmas songs. This CD is great with all good songs everyone enjoys. Will always play this every year,
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Classic movie about the holidays.  Love it!  Even my folks who are very conservative, they could relate...
0446530573|5.0|Best Christmas present I got in years. Whether you watch the Sopranos or not this book is fantastic. It has outstanding tips in all facets of cooking. How hot your BBQ coals should be, how to check if fire to hot or cold. Has shopping lists and many recipes all interwoven with Sopranos history and trivia. Delightful at a great price.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead have pretty much run the gamut of rock music (from alternative to uncategorizable), and nearly all of their albums have been fantastic. Following the unsettling and fascinating sonic landscape of OK Computer (my favorite description of it was that it \\"sounds like what the future will look like\\" or something to that effect), the band emerged with the bizarre Kid A, which has its great and not-so-great moments. Amnesiac was released shortly thereafter, with what appeared to be much less fanfare- and thus far less subsequent attention. However, it is the one Radiohead album I return to more than any other...even though I enjoy HTTT very much (and feel that it was their most cohesive record since OKC), both it and In Rainbows, as lovely as it is, do not match the spirit that lies within Amnesiac. At times sparse, at others emotionally complex, the songs that comprise this album are truly distinct and carry a weight which transcends melody or lyrics; they seem to have an urgency and depth about them, a sense of impending...well, inevitabllity- as though events are transpiring rapidly or coming up from all sides (both within and without) and we must navigate them with care lest we become caught within the labyrinth (as some of the artwork also seems to suggest). With the much-heralded release of IR, and the well-deserved accolades of OKC, Amnesiac should not be overlooked or dismissed as merely the happenstance sibling of Kid A, but observed perhaps as an artifact of some of our innermost (labyrinthine?) desires and often unspoken concerns...and cherished as such.
B000002J7U|5.0|All tracks are good. I play this CD quite often. One of his best, you cannot go wrong with this CD if you like Vangelis and this kind of music.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|Great service!  My husband, and I, loved the movies.  This is a set to add to your collection!
B000GRUS22|4.0|Not anything Enigma did since his debut of MCMXC a.D. could match it. But if you liked his sound, you should have this CD as well. I liked all tracks except #10 & #12 where he sings, and basically he should not do that. His voice is flat and limited.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I appreciate only a few rock bands, and Radiohead is in my top five.  I was introduced to the band in the days of \\"OK Computer.\\"  It was a new and different sound for me, but after listening to it a few times, I was convinced that Radiohead would become one of my favorite bands.  I've purchased all of their albums since \\"OK Computer,\\" and will be a supportive listener of their releases, no matter how perfect or imperfect they might be.  \\"In Rainbows,\\" is their most melodious album to date.  I can find myself singing many of the songs. Yorke's unusual, yet expressive singing is much clearer here, and the lyrics are much easier to understand.  I like every song on this album, and can listen to it from start to finish.  A very gifted band.
B000001ZS4|5.0|If you like Jarre, this should be in your collection. A classic. His later work never bested his first 3 albums: Oxygene, Equinoxe and Les Chants Magnetiques.
B000002OX5|2.0|This album epitomized 'thinking person's rock' in 1967, and I had hoped that an expanded version would make it even more rewarding 40 years on. Sadly, the commercial breaks are shortened, and the added songs are not up to the quality of original selection. I have to say that it was a disappointment, and I'm glad I still have a CD of the original to refer to.
B000001ZS5|5.0|I you like Jarre, this is another classic. His later work never was better than his first 3 albums: Oxygene, Equinox and this one, Les Chantes Magnetiques. I gave 5 stars to all these 3 albums.
B000VSBX34|5.0|HELP -  The best of the 4 Movies created by the Beatles, FULL of comedy , coupled with some of their truly great songs from the period prior to 1967<br />a Great DVD and with British actors from that generation..<br />Very Beatles. Very British
B000002JB8|5.0|I just bought this CD, and I discovered this is really an excellent CD. I like all tracks and play it very often.
B00005JNEW|4.0|***1/2 2004. Co-written and directed by Peter Berg, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an adaptation of Buzz Bissinger's [[ASIN:B000P2XNL6 Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream]] . Another football movie telling, this time, the story of a Texas high school team heading to the state championship. Good movie presenting this sport as an American rite of passage for boys.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|Enigma did a stellar debut with MCMXC a.D. and later CD's never could match that debut. This CD is quite bad because Michael Cretu sings on about 80% of the tracks, and singing is not his forte. With track #5 the text is \\"my heart goes boom boom boom, every time I think of you\\". Is he trying to be a teenage popstar? He is around 40-50 years old by now. I do not recommend this CD.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Wow, great album.. Love track two.. If only it were longer! This is one of those albums that when you get to the end you wish they had another one done already
B000J3EEBY|5.0|If you like Loreena, you should buy this album. Maybe not her best, but still an excellent piece of work. All tracks are good. I play it quite often. You cannot go wrong with ths CD.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As an amateur war historian, this movie presents events in an accurate and engaging way.  The views of each episode make it unique in the war movie genre and sets it apart from other movies/series.  I also advise looking for good sales on this product and Amazon is a good place to find it.
0765357151|5.0|I bought this book because I had seen the movie and heard it wasn't quite the same as the book.<br /><br />Being an avid reader, I know that most books don't make it to the screen without 'hollywood' adjustments (Harry Potter, etc).<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at the main story (I Am Legend). The story/ending wasn't at all like the movie (this was a good thing). The movie should've kept to the book (rumor has it Will Smith tried to get the studios to but they wanted a more happy \\"hollywood\\" ending).<br /><br />I've started reading the other mini-stories and some of them are really creepy & for the time period in which they were written; well ahead of their time.<br /><br />I would recommend this to others but to be warned at times; the book can be a bit slow. But definitely worth the read.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|What a GREAT movie about the health care crisis in America. It was well done and with a bit of humor, though the problem is not-at-all funny. In California, Blue Cross (of WellPoint) shipped nearly a Billion dollars of profit out of state just last March -- after paying executives huge salaries. Said one Vice-president of Blue Cross, who was at a meeting with me, \\"This is America! I'm not going to apologize for making money.\\" Maybe he should tell that to one of the many patients who had their coverage cancelled AFTER Blue Cross had approved their procedures and care.
B000002QWD|5.0|This is the best Bing Christmas CD.  Another one that sells at Amazon and in stores is from an old radio show that is of poor quality.  This CD is well worth the money and provides quality classic sound.
0812550706|5.0|This purchase was for a friend because I enjoyed the book so much.  It is well written and has a brilliant, imaginatve story as does the rest of the books in the series
0634022296|5.0|Was buying the expensive Beatles complete songbook that my husband requested and found this too.  Bought it on a whim not sure if it was something he could use in addition to the $65 book or not.  He loves it and says he doesn't even need the big book - but might keep it as a showpiece!  Thanks for the suggestion, Amazon!
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This is the bells and whistles version and the one to buy if like me you love this movie.All four versions of Blade Runner in hd plus  a HUGE amount of extras(screen tests,deleted scenes,trailers etc etc).See this on a big tft with 7.1 surround with a bottle of wine and the Wife out with her friends....Heaven!
0679807993|5.0|All four of my children had this book read to them many, many times when they were young, and I can attest to the fact that it all sunk in!  In fact, now in their 20's, they still quote this book.  I'm purchasing another today, for my second grandchild.  I'm so glad it's still available!  Great book!  It gives really cute, friendly examples of the benefits of manners and helping others.
B0010358D0|5.0|So I'm looking at my \\"Open and Recently Shipped Orders\\" and I wonder why the price on this item is still so high.  So I come here and see the new pic for it.  Looks like another Steelbook, just like the one from the first movie's 2-disc edition.  Which is good because it'll fit next to the original quite nicely.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I love this movie. We had such a hard time finding it. Made a great Christmas present.
B00002E224|5.0|A romance where there is virtually no plot, no action or interesting events, just two young people talking about love and life against the backdrop of Vienna?  Yes, but despite, or because of this, it works. It works mainly because of the effortless youthful charm of the two lovers Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and the intelligent and seemingly almost unscripted conversations between them. It rises above the merely mundane because of the masterly little touches by Director Richard Linklater, such as the constant references to time and the chiming of clocks, and to death and decay, or, at the very beggining of the movie, in which the pair only meet because Celine (Julie) moves into a different carriage due to the bitter arguing of a middle-aged and worn out couple.<br /><br />In fact this intellectual romance is pervaded throughout by a sense of melancholy and the capricious folly of existence. Set in Vienna, a city beautiful and romantic, yet which nonetheless retains the feel of being a living museum to a Europe once glorious and alive but now long dead and gone, there is something tragic and moving about these two lovers. At every moment they seem acutely and painfully conscious that they are playing out their roles against the incessant march of time, with an acceptance that sexual love is simply a cruel trick of nature, and yet who both nonetheless, seem so determined that for one day only, they can make something beautifully real and eternal between themselves.  For 90 minutes only, cast your cynicisim aside, and simply lose yourself in this beautiful film.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini enables us to identify with  human beings whose sufferings from a distance can so easily  be ignored. Bringing alive individuals whose spirits soar in spite of horrendous adversity should awaken us  to the realities of the human condition. His context, because he knows it so well, is Afghanistan. The humanity about which and with which he writes enables the reader to think and know that similar lives (and deaths) are in Iraq, Congo, Colombia....  For Americans it should be an enriching and humbling read, and one that, in gratitude for what we have, makes us better peace makers, supporters of international law and cooperation, and more truly generous and loving to our fellow human beings.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've had these headsets before. I've tried many different models but these fit me the best and I can wear them for hours. I can drop them around my neck quickly and they are comfortably stored until I need them again. I listen to a lot of podcasts and the sound quality is fine. I'm certain there are better headsets for listening to music.
B000W07EKW|5.0|My 2 boys thought they were into Bond until we hooked up the surround sound and threw in the first Bourne movie.  After each movie they could not wait to see the next.  Neither could I.  Nice set, beautifully packaged, with great extras.
B00004STPT|5.0|It was all I expected and more. A great collection and mixture of intense, up beat, high action musical sequences, and soft, sad, slow portions that are truly beautiful.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Unfortunately this arrived too late for christmas and i purchased it at a local retailer.  This is the first time I have ever ordered something from amazon that has not arrived when it was supposed to. I did return it to the seller.
1401300529|2.0|If you want to read about the Korean War filtered through the prism of Vietnam, this is the book for you.
6305291446|5.0|Halloween H2O was such a thrill to watch. With all of the releases in the HALLOWEEN franchise, H2O is right up there with Halloween 1 & 2. Jaime Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, 20 yrs later and Michael Myers finds her. This is a great movie that I feel will just get better with time.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|One of the best and cleanest shows there is, you can watch it with your kids.
B00103584Y|4.0|Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt auf Deutsch) is an artsy film that some people might not get when they first watch it. I know it didn't until I watched it a couple more times.<br /><br />It's a movie about what ifs and without giving the plot to the story, there are lots of repeating scenes of what would have happened if I had done this. It is an interesting film, and I would recommend watching it in the original German rather than the English dubbed version.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas and I must say I am very pleased. My son and I have a blast setting up targets at a good ways away and then takeing them out. This toy is well built and rugged. It is also pretty accurate. I give it 4 out of 5 stars overall. Have fun!
B0007OY2P8|1.0|Received DVD  with second side unplayable, disk separation, very unhappy result. I now purchase my DVD's at another site, which was a ease and has great costumer support and much better prices. Amazon has become too bloated to check it's quality and have a responsive customer service. I love Jane Austen, have read and have all versions of videos of her work going back too BBC stuff from the seventies [my most favorite]. The newest version so to be released in 2008 Northanger Abby, sounds good. Amazon does not keep up with new releases or version of Austen, Dickens, Elliot, or James. Do yourself a favor though look to other DVD suppliers for your DVD's.  John S.
0375714839|2.0|Last night I had the opportunity to watch Persepolis, a movie based on graphic novels by French based Iranian author Marjane Satrapi that I had read before as well...<br /><br />Overall, the movie was not bad although it had several historical errors and many shortcomings which I am going to talk about in this entry. If you're informed enough about Iran, this can be a refreshing look at things but if not, you got to read a bit more before seeing this movie.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes of the film is to bash the former Shah of Iran and his late father Reza Shah the great as most ex-Communists and leftists do these days and mislead the viewers to believe that Reza Shah the great was a product of British control over Iran at the time which is an utter nonsense and it just goes to repeat the same old cliche of conspiracy theorists in the Iranian society. Yes, the vast majority of Iranians still believe that British had something to do with installing Reza Shah to power and they're unable to see the facts of the past and accept that Reza Shah was not installed by the Brits, yet he disliked the colonial powers and was an extreme nationalist who cared for nothing but his own shattered country. The other shortcoming of this animated film was to repeat the same terrible anti-Shah nonsense that you can hear in most Marxist-Islamist circles today. The first 20-30 minutes were badly wasted to tell the clueless western viewer that the Shah was wrong to prosecute the Stalin supported Azeri separatists of Iran in 1946-47 who had orders from Kremlin to disintegrate Iran from within. Yes, according to Ms. Satrapi's accounts, it was okay for a Stalinist group to seize parts of Iran but it was wrong for the government to stop them. One has to remember that Ms. Satrapi basically comes from a Communist family where his uncles and father are/were proudly anti-Shah Marxist activists.<br /><br />What disturbed me most through out the entire movie was the fact that author really failed to mention the source of oppression in post-revolution Iran which is/was Islamofascism and the mullahs who enforce that ideology. No mention of Khomeini in the movie is a mystery to me. Ms. Satrapi portrayed the late Shah as a commie-hating brutal dictator, yet she definitely failed to show who the real evil was represented by in post-revolution Iran. Yeah, I saw the moral police behavior towards western clothing or late night parties but who enforced that? Satrapi failed to tell the viewer. If I wasn't from that country or didn't know much, I'd not be able to guess who enforced a ban on alcohol or western music.<br /><br />The graphic novels which this animated movie is based on are truly reflective of the lives of many Iranians who like Ms. Satrapi suffered a a lot but again one has to remember that the story told by the author represents a tiny minority of the Iranian people. And the novels are the memoirs of one specific person and don't really tell us the whole story and I, for one, didn't expect her to talk about my story or stories of others. Persepolis is the story of Marjane Satrapi and for that, it is nothing special. She got to go to Europe because her family could afford it while me and tons of people like me had to suffer under the war of the cities and put up with the Islamic regime oppressive system. She got to leave Iran in mid 1990s again when she got depressed after a short time living under the mullah's rule but millions and millions of us had no choice but to stay there and soldier on. Persepolis animated movie is just about Ms. Satrapi's complicated life and has nothing to do with the vast majority of the people held hostage by the Islamic regime of Iran. Kudos to her for making money by selling her story but it really doesn't change much for those who still live inside of the country and have to suffer a great deal due to the mistakes Ms. Satrapi's communist father and uncles made in pre-revolution eras. You need to be informed about the history of Iran before watching any Iranian related movie, otherwise you might run a risk of being misled or misinformed.<br /><br />At the end, I'd give Persepolis 2.5 stars out of 5. It doesn't get any better!y of Iran before watching any Iranian related movie, otherwise you might run a risk of being misled or misinformed.<br /><br />At the end, I'd give Persepolis 2.5 stars out of 5. It doesn't get any better!
6305754969|5.0|I am about 50. And I have a fairly large DVD collection and before that LD (never collected VHS). I have a TIVO and have had one for about 9 years. I am always looking for more good films. So with that background understand that I have been fortunate enough to see many classic films in the theatre, or on cable or SAT. Without commercials(the ONLY way to watch anything).  I am a John Wayne fan and a fan of westerns.  I like a lot of different ones- from Stagecoach (both versions) to Clint Eastwoods new ones to Peckinpah and Fords.     And this movie is MY FAVORITE WESTERN.  I like most of John Waynes films from the late 40s on. And most westerns from that time on. Earlier then that not much.    With that background in mind here is my review:    I had this film on LD for years and upgraded to DVD.  I watch it on a projection screen with a pretty good home theatre so its like watching it in a real picture palace (except no bratty kids or chewing gum stuck on the seats).  The opening score and song are classic; the pictures (painted by The Swede-Thorntons gunsmith friend) rival Remmington at his best.  For those that remember the TV Series \\"How The West was Won\\" of the late 70s this opening score and paintings are just as good.    The Duke is a top gun man for hire; not young and he knows it. He is about to take a job from Bart Jason (Ed Asner) but the local sheriff finds him first. He is an old friend. And Cole Thornton finds out that the job is to kill his old friend. Needless to say Cole tells Jason where he can stick his job.  Unfortunately a well meaning friend has told the ultimate target of jason that Thornton is here after him and his family and a tragedy occurrs that will have ramifications for the entire movie.  the First half hour of this film sets up the rest in all ways. And does a pretty good job of it.   In many ways this is as complete a film as you could ask for- and they do it without voice over which is a real mark in its favor as regards allowing theviewer to make up his mind and figure it out all on his own.  John Wayne in this film really starts to accept the aging process. There are good bits here and there that show this. Mitchum does as well but not to the same degree (of course Mitchum was younger so....)  There are so many good little scenes and the supporting charactors are all very well fleshed out-with the exception of Jason (but this bad guy is just simply a greedy man wanting power and willing to have others do the killing for him- which is smart since the one time he does pick up a gun it does not turn out well for him).   This is a remake of Rio Bravo- but I am not alone in thinking that this is just as good and in some areas better (no singing, no Ricky Nelson).  Angie Dickinson is a little better then Charlene Holt, but then her part is also much bigger. James Caan is PERFECT as the young green kid who cannot shoot straight. Arthur Hunnicut is to me frankly better as the crotchety old Deputy. Michele Carey has a great part as a cowgirl who is a top shot (which Cole Thornton finds out the hard way)= she is an actress who sadly never got enough parts = I think she could have been a real star. Christopher George plays the Top Gun on the other side- and how his part is handled shows the master craftsman Howard Hawks at his best. He took care for such a relatively small part to flesh out it and the charactor very well without using much screen time.   If you like westerns you will love this film. If you like John Wayne you will love this film.   If you like films that were made by master craftsmen like Howard Hawks with a cast as good as you can ask for and dialogue well fitted you will love this film.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This brings me back to being 14 years old, and having a whole world around me that I'd yet to explore or understand. Angela Chase was a kindred spirit, and watching these episodes feels like time travel. Back to the era of grunge and plaid and virginity-- to my teenage years. I can appreciate the series in a whole new way now, being in my late twenties, and realize what an incredibly smart and honest television show this was. Be prepared to have lines of dialog stuck in your head, to reminisce and lose all track of time, and to mourn when the last episode ends.  \\"When you really look closely, people are so strange and so complicated that they're actually...beautiful. Possibly even me.\\" -Angela Chase, My-So-Called Life.
0803730470|5.0|My daughters love the story. The little mouse is a clever guy who is shows that you don't need to be big and strong to win... but smart. The illustrations are colorful and happy and well done. The sequel \\"Gruffalo's child\\" is not as good. But the \\"Snail and the Whale\\" and \\"Room in the Broom\\" are even better than this one :)
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I was so glad it got here on time for our Christmas celebration at home.  She loves it!
B000I0QL82|4.0|The movie Holiday Inn was everything we had hoped it to be.  It was delivered promptly & in excellent condition.  It made a great Christmas gift for my wife.
