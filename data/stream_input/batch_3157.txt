B007VDN1PA|4.0|I've used it only for slide so far.  It is simple to use and works as detailed in the description.  Would like to improve resolution but unsure if that's a factor of the slides (which are quite old).  Happy with it regardless as I was concerned the slides would further deteriorate.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has perfectly balanced his ability to recreate the legal world of the deep south with his ability to bring to life real, three-dimensional, complex characters.  At the same time he has not lost his ability as a top-quality storyteller.  I enjoyd this book as I have enjoyed everything I have read by this author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|good game.  I hate that everything is tied to facebook tho and whatever happened to just playing a game without running out of lives?  good fun game tho!
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|The book always felt like I had just started. There was always something else happening, I almost couldn't keep up. The action was nonstop.  Her descriptions made me feel like I was there.  It was just an amazing story!
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|So glad to have a new album and new songs by Cher.  I love the oldies, but this is refreshing.
B00499NHLC|4.0|A very different Holmes and Watson than what I am used to, but I enjoy the suspense and the twist and turns of the show.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have always imagined what happened to Danny Torrence after &#34;The Shining&#34; but this story was so much better than anything my imagination could ever make up! I couldn't put it down, it was so heartfelt and riveting. Another great one Mr. King!
B00GO95BUU|5.0|Best anniversary episode ever! Most epic episode ever! Smith, Tennant & Hurt! The Time War!<br /><br />Not the best place to start for a beginner though. Nice payoffs for long time fans however.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great, a little pokey sometimes and only does 2.4GHz but it's a good little gadget. Sometimes makes me regret spending the money on a Roku 3.<br /><br />That is until you look at all the extra stuff and content the Roku 3 brings.<br /><br />For the money though it's a great little device.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Loved this series!  This book was my least favorite. Still a good read and worth finishing the series. Best love interest couple. Interesting character shifts and changes.
1441892168|2.0|Don't buy this if you're expecting an unabridged version, because it is NOT. I want my money back. I've been reading this book my entire life and know the story. What a disappointment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book one only leaves me hungry for more... I want know more, what will happen to these two characters that I know care for so much? I only hope for the best.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this head set back in August 2012, and its still working. Although recently one of the speakers inside the right ear has stopped working. It was semi noticable once I turned off the Surround Sound. Lights are still working, it still charges well, the Voice changing buttons still work, Mute button still works, nothing broken, still stays secured at the level I want it to rest on my head. Over all I'm very satisfied. Given it a 5 star for lasting this long with 1 flaw was worth the 100$ I spent on it at the time  Edit: June 1st, 2016; Well now the headphones are having trouble holding a charge. It often beeps and looks for a signal to the receiver. If I unplug it from the Charge cable after about 10 min, it dies even if it's been charging all night. I'd like to reiterate that I've had this headset since 2012, its now 2016... This headset has lasted me this long for 100$. I play Video Games a lot and use this headset for voice com very often. So I'm very happy with my purchase!
1623650003|5.0|I want to type the words “spoiler alert” so I can tell you everything.<br /><br />But I won’t.<br /><br />At least, I don't think I will.<br /><br />I’d put “Alex” right up there with the best mystery-thrillers I’ve ever read.<br /><br />&#34;Alex&#34; is both mystery and thriller in equal doses, with plenty of clue-finding (mystery) and more flips and twists than a whole pack of gymnasts (thriller).<br /><br />Dark? Yes. Violent? In places, yes.<br /><br />I felt like I was reading a mash-up of one of Michael Connelly’s best Harry Bosch works and one of Patricia Highsmith’s psycho-dark stories like “Ripley Under Ground” or that out-of-control scene near the end of “Suspension of Mercy,” the scene with the pills.<br /><br />But nothing about “Alex” felt derivative, either.<br /><br />“Alex” alternates points of view between diminutive (4’11”) Police Commandant Camille Verhoeven and the victim of a kidnapping, Alex Pr&eacute;vost, who is stuffed in a too-small cage and left to die in an abandoned warehouse. For most of “Alex,” the scene is Paris.  (Can’t vouch for the translation, but loved the cool, unexcited writing style.)<br /><br />Both Camille and Alex have issues. Camille is a brooding cop, but considering the way he’s treated and what he’s been through, he gets a pass from me. He’s relentless and curious and smart, even given nothing to work with. The cops squabble among each other. There are bureaucratic issues, fiefdoms, jealousies, egos. Camille prefers to get out his sketchpad and think.<br /><br />It’s nearly impossible to write a review of “Alex” without giving too much away.  But the feeling of reading “Alex” is one where you’ll bring the book with you wherever you go in case you get a minute or two to sneak in a few more moments.<br /><br />I can’t remember a story line that turned on itself so many times—and pulled it off so well. I never felt mistreated by the way the plot was structured, even as the game changed and shifted (and I’m biting my fingers now so I don’t type too much).<br /><br />“Alex” is a grisly but when all is revealed the violence is … appropriate? Justified? Just right given the backstory (the part I can’t write about)?<br /><br />“Alex” is so good you want to say as little as possible. So I tried to do my best.<br /><br />Okay, here are those two cautionary words: spoiler alert.  Read the last thought only if you don’t want to be surprised. (And I’ll still try not to give too much away).<br /><br />I have never read a book where one of the main characters transformed before my eyes from victim to protagonist to judge to executioner.  What a ride.ven as the game changed and shifted (and I’m biting my fingers now so I don’t type too much).<br /><br />“Alex” is a grisly but when all is revealed the violence is … appropriate?

B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie was alright, but I was honestly annoyed about how much running their is in this film... Like literaly it was just Brad Pit running 90% of the time. Honestly that's my only complaint about the film other then that, the acting was well done, the CGI was great, and the story was good. Just wished there was less running and maybe a little more gun fire, not resident evil gunfire...
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Love this group. They are my favorite new group.  I got to see them in concert in Cary, NC and they were just as great as the cd.  I do hope they make more music.  I am a new fan.
B00003CXDD|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. JUST TOP NOTCH. I MUST SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's ok I guess but its just I get really board but is fun :) you should buy this game to :D
B0044XV3R8|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. JUST TOP NOTCH. I MUST SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Looking forward to more levels. Challenging and very addictive.<br />Took approximately 90 minutes to complete the game with a little help from hubby on a couple puzzles.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was awesome!! As others have said everything about the game is  perfect it is full of suspense, hidden objects  puzzles and some thinking.<br /><br />It was so much fun I didn't want it to end and will most likely play it again in hopes that the sequels will be out soon.<br />I recommend this game to anyone who loves a good mystery. Big fish you rocked this game I hope you can come out with many more like this one.  It's worth every penny and then some
1455521310|5.0|Whatever the others say about this book, BALDACCI has the most vivid imagination of any author  on the market. if you didn't find this book a real page turner, , then there is something wrong with  your reading skills,  I always say after reading his books, this was the best book I have ever read, and then Baldacci comes along and proves me wrong, King and Maxwell was the most is the best, book he has written so far. unbelievable right to the very end. The satellite part was a little hard to swallow, but the reasons for building one, will enlighten your horizons for sure.. I read the entire book  in five days, I just could not put it down, and you won't either  I never figured the general to be in on the -plot, thank you David Baldacci for a great book.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Very good movie!  Glad I bought it and will watch it many times more.<br />xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx That's all I have to say but Amazon wants more...........
147676459X|5.0|Crazy, this writer hits the funny bone and then your funny head in a way no other does. An intimate look at the inner workings of a very strange person.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This games is so fun get it u will love it. Good game all around if u font get it you will regret it.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Loved this movie.  I watched it through my wii and it worked great!  A great option when redbox doesn't have what you want.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tho I've not gotten to use it much yet, I was thrilled to find it list all the local and surrounding area radio stations. For a free d/l this is great.
B006QVRUS2|5.0|Hilarious movie.  Great writing, great humor, full of awkward moments.  Great juxtaposition between children acting like adults (towards the end) with adults acting like children (the bulk of the movie).  My only complaint is that it was so good, I don't know if they knew how to end it properly, and it ended very abruptly.  Regardless, this is a very funny smart movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved the first book in this series. Vividly told...breathtaking, racy, & heart-wrenching. This book doesn't disappoint I can't wait for the next book!!
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|Prompt delivery.  Gift for my grandaughter this advent season so haven't seen it open it.  Looks adorable from what I can tell.
0345803507|3.0|Read them all, but it is not until the third book you see the sick dude find a cure to his issues and become a great father.  Innocent female lead walks him through what a sex therapist would do.  She got a nice man in the end.  WHEW  , the journey was arduous.
B00AEBB86A|1.0|Numerous bad spot on the DVD. At least 8spots had to be skipped by or run over and over sometimes I could get by other spots<br />I had to use the controller so skip.
B009NX3U20|4.0|This was a pretty good sci-fi movie.  However the shaky camera was really annoying at some point in the movie. It was nice to see one of these PO V-type movies where you actually did get to see the enemy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|no matter if u have a horse or not best game eva!!!**:) I'm about to get another horse. so excited
B008Y768XO|5.0|Great, heartwarming (and wrenching) family movie. Excellent message of love and loyalty. Highly recommend this movie; the acting was also top notch
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|This is THE BEST DAMN AVRIL LAVIGNE ALBUM.  I have NOT found a single song on this cd that I don't want to hear more than once.  On Britney Spears Femme Fatale album I skip \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" every time because the first time I heard it was all I could stand of it.  This album I like all the songs.  Even the one song on here I like the least, \\"Let Me Go\\", I like enough to NOT skip it.  My favorite 3 songs on this cd are \\"Give You What You Like\\", \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Hello Kitty.  In my opinion, Avril is going to have a tough time topping this album.  She certainly outdid Katy Perry.  One of these days I'm going to write a 2 star review (one for each of the only 2 songs on it I like) of Katy Perry's album Prism.  Stay tune for that.<br />The title and first line of this review sums up this review: This is THE BEST DAMN AVRIL LAVIGNE ALBUM.
0060507772|5.0|It was really annoying to find a copy of this book because it's not in the standard trade paperback size and therefore a lot of places don't carry it, but was worth the wait. The illustrations are rich and detailed and complement the story perfectly. Kidby + Prachett = win. Definitely worth it for any Discworld fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is just as captivating as the first, with the ability to bring you to tears much more prominent.
B000NY12LO|5.0|It is disturbing on many levels, but riveting.  We all know that school shootings are just insane and crippling to society as a whole.  This book makes you look at all levels of such a trauma.  As a parent it really makes you think about, both the lost children who were shot and the loss of a child who was the shooter.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm giving this book a 5 because of its unique storyline that kept me turning pages day after day. I enjoyed reading the montage of Pat's journey and his undying belief in silver linings. I'm ready to watch the movie now to see how the movie in my mind played out on the big screen.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I haven't been touched by a book in quite awhile. This story was so heartfelt I was reduced to tears...that hasn't happened in years !
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I really enjoy this game but some of the scenes are too busy for a phone screen.  some of them you can zoom in but it is difficult on some of the other levels
B00GKS2HN4|5.0|really good game a big big challenge but its nice i recomend this game ... its not a waist of time n it works really good on my kinddle
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Typical Grisham. I always buy them because they are entertaining, good stories for a movie, etc. However, I nearly put this one down as one I could not finish because the writing and editing is so poorly done. Lazy writing, lazy editing - but a fun story if you can stand it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, this game is very addictive, and yet challenging. I have not had any issues with glitches, I play on my phone and kindle.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app. Helps me a lot when too much junk is still open when apps close.  Also great for other junk files like cache....
B00992CF6W|5.0|Try it I mean it may cost $6.00 but the game is super fun so buy it and play it or are you just scared
B00991TCOG|5.0|Just beautiful, high energy (mostly) electric violin.  Could not stop listening.  Techno fans will like this.  Good right to the last track.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally getting CCS on Kindle. I have another tablet that I'm not real happy with but kept it for CCS. The game is fun and addictive....even though I've been stuck on 181 for way to long, LOL, I love it!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really enjoyable to play!!!! Not just matching, but fun challenges and goals. Graphics are pretty cool!!!<br />Played for hours as soon as I downloaded it!!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I read this book in a week. It's a very good book about the true story of an real American hero and warrior.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE this game I think it is a good game for people who like Despicable me movie 1 and 2  rate it when you play it hope you like this game.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Great CD, all the original tunes that bring you back, I would recommend to anyone!! A fantastic addition to my collection.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is classic Stephen King.  I enjoyed it so much that I reread the shinning.  The ending left me wanting more.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|Right from the first track, I realized I had made the best purchase of my life! These 24 bit masters are so perfectly clear, distortion-less and musical, that I am enjoying The Beatles as if for the very first time. I can't begin to tell you the pleasure I'm deriving out of just having heard the first album, Please Please Me, recording all the way back in '63. It's so clear it's like being in the room with them. There is an aliveness I have never heard before, and I've listened to them on lots of high end systems, including my own, with a Nakamichi deck. Neither vinyl nor high end tape begins to compare with the purity and perfectness of this USB 24 bit set of masters. This is the greatest purchase I have made in my life, worth every penny. Plus, the USB format has the benefit of all the videos only a click away, so that you can watch a documentary on each album, then listen to the album with a click, and page through the artwork and articles written on the songs with another click. I can't think of a better way to enjoy the ultimate collection of music than in this format.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|His books are always fantastic. I have read all of his books. Thank you . Hopefully he writes many more.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|Perfect.  Full of remarkable twists and turns.  Very satisfactory conclusion.  Great acting and production.  Sophisticated sf and even a very dr who style new creature.  Loved the final dantastic surprise.
0060235152|5.0|The book arrived a little torn but Our grandkids love it.  We read it over and over and over again!
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is thought-provoking and insightful; The narrator has a novel way of thinking, starting from the middle of her story and creating suspense about what has happened to her chimpanzee twin. As an animal rights activist, I admire this book and delighted in the theme of compassion for the animal world and for human nature which it conveys.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love my talking Tom app because it entertains me and let's me grow my own Tom  and it is free
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Awesome series.  Can't wait to read the rest. A great combo of history and mythology. Wonderfully written and easy to read
B00GINENG0|5.0|I Love this game so much because i love seeing tom grow it is so cool i rated this app 5 star's I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
030758836X|1.0|This book was very engaging...at first. I couldn't put it down. Then, towards the end, it just became way too far fetched. I could poke holes in so many pieces of the story that it just became distracting for me. By the end, I still couldn't put the book down, but only because I wanted to finish it as quickly as possible so I could get it off my Kindle and move on to something better. I recommend not wasting your time on this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could not put this book down! But, by the end I wish I had. Just very disappointed in how this book ends.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Very entertaining! Cant wait to see the sequel! Was alittle skeptic about my girls 10 @11 watching it but they love this movie also! Definitely adding it to the family movie collection!
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Glad I didn't read this one first.  I've read all of the other available Harry books (except Police) and enjoyed them.  I looked forward to reading the beginnings of the series, but found it to be long, tedious & missing the masterful way Nesbo weaves his plots in his later books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just when you thought Katniss was in the clear... President Snow shows up to remind her of the power of the Capitol.<br />Loved the character development here, the relationship with Peeta and how we still some more information but get completely thrown off in the end...<br /><br />This is my 're-read of the book and can definitely say I didn't get bored AT ALL. All I wanted was to keep on reading.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Like it says, it works well, it opens a full browser version of FB, logs you in and takes you to where you left off. You can enlarge by basic android/ kindle fire gesture commands, you can get to every part of your Facebook page just like when you use a computer browser. You can set it to just take you to the log in screen so you can enter your i.d. and password or just have it do that for you.<br /><br />Now, what it can't do. It can't get you the PC app for Facebook messenger. You can't play facebook based games that mostly require an up to date Adobe Flash player, but no Android based app can do that, so it's not a deficiency of this app. It also can't take you from a video link that someone posted on their page to the video if it isn't on Facebook or again, if it's Flash based. That, in my opinion, is a good thing though, it will help keep younger users off sites that you might want to keep them from anyway.<br /><br />I deducted one star, it would have been a half if that was possible, because of the refresh bar that runs across the top. It would be better if you could set the frequency and timing of the page refreshes, it sometimes pulls you off what you're looking at. Also a less intrusive symbol, perhaps the blue spinning circle would be less intrusive than the yellow bar it uses now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book drags bit.  Kat seems to keep going on and on about saving Peeta.  It gets old really fast. The movie will be better because you won't be able to read Kats mind.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I'm addicted. I just wish there was longer game play. You have to wait real world time for your energy to go back up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is  the best game I've played to all you guys out there Dow n this game it's fun as he'll
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once you learn the process in the first room, you know what to look for. Just getting into it the game but so far I enjoy it. Give it a try and find the key in each room to unlock the door to the next level.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Was very glad to see this for Kindle Fire. Cute, kid friendly game that's easy to catch on to and enjoy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app with hourly predictions if you need them. May have a little more than I need but it opens very quickly and the info I want is right there.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|if you play Castleville, this is a nice alternative.  I quit playing the web game because I found it was too time consuming. So far this version has been easy to play.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I love this book. This is like the book that speaks out for the introvert crowd.<br /><br />Anyone who is in a relationship and who has children should definitely grab this book. This book also seems fit for introverted students. This is very empowering and has tips on how to survive in the real world without draining oneself. This talks about pseudo-extroversion and having restorative niches.<br /><br />This is an interesting read. Reading this can also help to discover oneself.
B006O5YHUY|4.0|Best unknown movie ever. Angry and bitter son returns to abusive father for fight training and in turn gains his family back.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love the story line, GIdion & Eva were so made to be together.  Please hurry and get the next book out.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Bonnie M
B00F5BON8O|5.0|Sarah is a very multi-talented and creative musician.<br />I am delighted to get to see and hear sarah perform with her group, as well as with many other great musicians, like Allison Krauss, David Grisman, and Mike Marshall, just to name a few.<br />The click-clock of Sara's clawhammer banjo style is absolutely mesmerizing, and that extra string!  I want a banjo like that.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|good search engine to find out info quickly on how to do things or find things give you six choices on where to save it
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|MEETS MY EXPECTATION,  It does the job it was designed to do, and does it well.  I was unsure of what to order, and was glad to discover this item was what I needed.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A mix of modern day and history, old and new, yet with so much in common, told with a beautifully written literary snap.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really like this game, however... im kind of stuck right now. I need more trees to chop but need another level. Not sure if im missing something?
B000SEFCD8|5.0|This is a amazingly well written and informative book. Dr. McConnell's writing style is easy to read and enjoyable. I have to admit (somewhat shamefacedly) that prior to reading it I would have thought of Applied Animal Behaviourist as one of those 'you do what' kind of jobs. What do we really know about animal psychology anyway, and what makes you or anyone else more informed on the matter than me? Well I would have been wrong. Dr. McConnell's book is well researched and based on more than simple anecdotal evidence. I learned a lot from it.<br /><br />It isn't a training book per se, though there are a decent number of training tips, how to redirect unwanted behaviours for example. This is primarily a book about what makes people people and dogs dogs. The main message is that we aren't the same. We are different species, with different needs and wants, and different interpretations of the same behaviours. Understanding this can make a world of difference in the lives of dog and their humans...or humans and their dogs. This should be required reading of all new dog owners.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was fascinating reading about the culture of the south as it exists today.  Also very informative reading about the legal profession and how it functions in society as a whole.  Another Grisham triumph!
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I originally picked this up for my small children. The idea was to pre-read it to ensure that it was suitable to be read to them. It is. In fact they will love it, just like I did. Diane Jones strings the reader along marvellously. You really do need to pay attention to the details though, they'll sneak up on you. What made this such an enjoyable read for me was the characters. Sophie, Howl, Calcipher, Michael et. al are wonderfully fleshed out, thoughtful and funny. I was sad to see the story end. It felt a bit like loosing friends. I was, of course, familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's animated version of the story, and though quite a lot is left out it doesn't stray too far from the book. So anyone who likes the anime will like to book. I recommend it for both children and adults.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved 50 Shades of Gray. I wasn't to sure at first but after I got pas the first couple of chapters I couldn't put it down. I have to say it was very educational in a good way. ;-)I read this at least 3 times. When I went back an reread it I realized I had missed somethings so I reread it again. I love a good love story an this one has a lot of ups an downs but it is worth it. Make sure you read all 3 of the books.
1476727651|5.0|Really great novel, not too long, captivating and well written. You don't need to have read or seen The Shining to understand the events that take place within Doctor Sleep, but it's still very much so a sequel, and a fitting one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say I am a fan. :-) I love this book. It reviles so much more of Christian an why he is the way he is. The love that grow between Christian an Anna is wonderful. To find someone to love us for who an what we are is out of this world. I believe that it is what all 3 book lead up too. The sex an other parts are just part of who he had to become to survive in his own head. I have read an reread this. He is  deserving of a great love.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|Pictures were very good. Clear.  Great camera settings. My shutter button worked slowly so I missed some shots. Even has zoom and white balance.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. As soon as I was was done with book 1 I opened this one. The more I read the more I fell in love with Christian an Anastasia story. They both have many  challenges to go trough. not only in there love but other parts of there lives. I think that they both start to become stronger with in them self's.
B0073V7YTY|5.0|Easy to use, just start it and see the readings. Compares the sound being measured to common noise sources which gives a nice reference point.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun I heard everybody talk about this game really addictive<br /><br />Once YOU start hard to put down I play every chance I get
B00BATG18K|2.0|I am almost finished with this book and I will be glad when it is over. It is just not that interesting. Others have said this is not a romance novel and that is true. There was so much happening during this period of time in the world and it was seldom mentioned.I did not find it to be a study of women at all. It seemed to me that so much attention was made about how to please a man that there was not time or room to truly devote to a story line. Dull and boring!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is fun but x2 dose not work for me. There are glitches and sometimes they make me die for no reason.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Don't waste your time reading this book. Had to painfully plow my way thru to the miserable end. And unfortunate ending book to a decent trilogy.
B0000WPADK|5.0|Great detail and low price.  This is for somebody who is detail oriented like me.  Great for ten years of age or older.
B005544TRQ|1.0|This show was offensive. I am a father and the language was terrible. We did not get past the first five minutes the language was so bad. This show should be rated R
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham makes you feel that you are there and the settings are so real for that time period I couldn't put it down.
0453005071|4.0|Was wanting to complete my Stephen King books and this did the trick.  Havent read all the stories yet, I know...shame on me, but look forward to it!!!
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|All the songs on this album are perfect. I don't think there's any I skip. Obviously I'm a big Drake fan & a bit biased.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Great book! It is full of suspense from beginning to end. I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A wonderful but sad story ..if you love books from the World War II era, you will enjoy this story and how the war was seen through they eyes of young people.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|It's got all the elements of a classic horror film, embedded in a classic horror film.  If you spent your Saturdays watching horror, you'll like it.
030758836X|4.0|A really great book...but once you get past a certain point, the twist has happened and it sort of gets a bit old. However, the feeling you are left with is very unnerving, as you would hope from a crime novel.
1442362537|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this book.  It was an enjoyable narration.  I had always wanted to know what happened to Danny after The Shinning.
0765367297|5.0|The first book in an exciting series worth reading. Everyone with an interest in books about futuristic space battles, amazing combats and cliffhanging excitement will find this book to be a most have in their collection.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Exciting play so very creative.  Make your village be anyway you want it and grow and make your own goods. Love it!
B00F3HQMV6|4.0|Great album with a great energy.  Got hooked on Live for the Night and got that one stuck in my head.  Checked out Alive, that one is amazing!  Previewed the rest of the album, loved it!  The energy that sisters Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf and Rain Man exude is amazing!  This is one album that I am definitely telling people about,  Let it be known, Krewella is here to stay!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Afternoon a stressful day at work and then working on our home, Relax Melody helps me to listen to sounds of places I have only dreamed of.  The sounds help me relax  physically and emotionally.  Thank you for the APP!
0452289963|5.0|This has to be by far the most influential book I've read in my life :)  Really made me change the way I view the world.  Bought 10 copies and gave them out as gifts to family and loved ones.  A great read!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am now the bingo girl because this game is so hard to get away from. If your the occasional bingo player, you won't be anyone after you play Bingo Blitz.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|It's fun but you need actual cash money to advance and there is no way to accrue it in the game. Wish it had the option to earn it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read every one . Of his books I think this is his best ever hard to put down.
B004DYT97E|5.0|This is an excellent book. It is the second book of the series &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34;  written by George R. R. Martin. The book is wonderfully written and keeps you turning the pages. The book arrived in perfect condition and I received it very quickly.
B002FE5XVK|3.0|As others have stated, this is arguably the best concert video ever filmed. Someone showed me this movie in college, when I wasn't a Talking Heads fan. While watching it, the light bulb went off, and I thought, &#34;Aaaaaah, so that's what they're doing&#34;. I've been hooked ever since. When this came out on Blu-Ray, I had to have it. Unfortunately, this disc has issues. There are numerous instances of the audio not matching up with the video, and the video itself doesn't look very cleaned up from the original version. However, the audio, in and of itself, is fantastic.<br /><br />Pro's: Great concert, amazing audio quality.<br />Con's: Bad audio/video sync, grainy video quality.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|This is a great mystery, great characters, and all comes together in the end, as it should. Well done again,
B003LYJUXU|5.0|Great CD! The price here on Amazon cannot be beat either.  Really like the layout of it too. My only complaint is the case is really rather cheap but thats not enough to knock a star off.  I like the music and the price too much for that to happen.
0792839129|5.0|What a great entertaining movie for the entire family! Dick Van Dyke's singing and dancing is so energetic.  Nice  car race scenes from the Grand Prix's of the early 1900's. This is such a long movie, that an intermission is given in the middle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The free version is great, but the full version is even better. In the free version, you get access to only half of the objects and you cannot save your game, thus losing your world when you quit. In the full version, you can save your game and you have access to all of the objects. Both Creation and Survival Modes provide a large land for you to explore.<br /><br />In Creation mode, my favorite one, there are no enemies, you cannot die, it always stays daytime, you have the power to go into fly mode (fly anywhere you want to go), and all the objects in the game are provided to you infinitely.<br /><br />In Survival Mode, you start out with no objects and have to either search for them or craft them. Plus, you can die, there's a day/night cycle, there are enemies for you to fight, and there are animals that you can kill to get certain stuff. For example, you can kill sheep to get wool, cows to get pork, etc. Also, the items you collect will not be infinite.<br /><br />I suggest this game for anyone who loves playing Minecraft on PC. It's just like the computer version. If you love those type of games where you can use blocks to build whatever you want, you'll have fun playing this!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Even though I just bought this game it's super awesome u get to shoot a lot of  stuff. it's hard to kill a bear when it's coming at u  but it's still awesome
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game. Very entertaining and don't have to spend money if you don't want to.<br />Would recommended this game if you enjoy the farm games.
0792839749|5.0|great classic. my kids cant get enough of it. reminds me how much hollywood has sunk over the years. just ordered mary poppins
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This upgrade works great.  You do not need to use the tail switch cap, the light works great without it.  The light is much brighter using the LED bulb and you can focus the light, just not as much as before.  I am very happy with the product and plan on buying another.
B000CNE092|5.0|My children loved this movie , the story is fabulous  songs are magical. We had a great family time watching it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it is so awesome because I am on level five!!!!!! do you like it!?!?!?it is..................fun! I like it so much!
B002K0WBXW|4.0|It is a nice film . But I really wish that they stop making films with such inappropriate scenes .
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|LOVE THIS CD. ALICE IN CHAINS LIVES ON. SOMR PEOPLE SAY THE ORIGINAL SINGER IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO BUT THIS GUY IS PRETTY GOOD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It hard to put it down at times, I love that they keep updating. There is no way that you can get bored.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I'm really liking this so far. My sister and I adored this game on Facebook. I'm sooo happy I can get it on my kindle.
B0051CSI0G|2.0|I gave it one star for the lame plot.  Typical over the top vampire/zombie survival gorefest.  Nothing new here except repeated anti-government and anti-Christian rhetoric.  I was watching a part where the protagonists (if that's what you want to call them) were attacked by &#34;vamps&#34; dropped from helicopters by &#34;Christian crazies&#34; to attack innocent human survivors. There's no rhyme or reason plotwise of why &#34;Christian crazies&#34; were dropping vamps as weapons, but yeah, whoever wrote this screenplay seems to have something against Christians. It wasn't &#34;Muslim crazies, Jewish crazies, Atheist crazies, etc.  If the writers had chosen one of those three I might have been impressed.  Alas, they took the modern easy route.<br /><br />I stopped watching as the story just seemed to plod along  and a certain point I didn't care who survived.  The sound effects of the &#34;vamps&#34; seems to be a blend of &#34;cows, lions, dogs, and pigs&#34;.  I'll give them that one.  Who knows what these creatures would sound like.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Can create so much! My latest picture, I Love Taco, was created from PicsArt. But it looks like it was from the web!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Love John Grisham books, this is just another example of his great mind. I wish I could share this with my family in the Philippines. They also love this author..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Keeps my attention. The only thing I do not like about it is when I run out of life's to play. There is an option to buy more lives but one of my favorite aspects of the game is it can be absolutely 100 percent free
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is one of the best game I have . The first time I have played it was awesome . dinosaurs and ice age animal's ,awesome.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This book kept up the suspense from beginning to end. It was hard for me to turn from one page to another wondering what was going to Happen next to Pendergast. enjoyed reading it very much.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Well researched, with the narrative well paced keeping the pages turning. I can only hope this book and others like it will awake us from our false sense of security. Otherwise you better start prepping for a dark future.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Denzel Washington is portrayed as a gifted airline pilot who performs an exceptional flight maneuver on a jet liner in a spiral death dive due to mechanical failure within the aircraft flight controls; he manages to invert the aircraft flying upside down to avoid crash and manages to revert flight position to crash land in a field, thus preventing loss of all person's lives on board.  He does this while intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine in his system.  During the NTSB investigation toxicology reveals his intoxicated status; however, he maintains that he saved all the lives of the survivors.  In the weeks following the crash he continues his alcoholic and drug consumption in spite of the necessity for him to give them up; on the night before the NTSB hearing he goes on a binge of alcohol and is found intoxicated on the bathroom floor; in order to ready himself for the hearing, he calls in a drug dealer who gives him cocaine to recover from his binge.  He is informed during the investigation that nine other airline pilots were placed in simulators and could not maneuver the jet liner to avoid a crash  under the flight conditions that he faced during the morbid crash.<br />In the interim from his recovery from the crash injuries and release from the hospital, he has had ample opportunity to obtain assistance for his alcohol/drug additions but refuses and maintains that he chooses to drink and has control.  In the end, all of his denial catches up with him, he finally admits at the NTSB hearing that he was intoxicated during the flight, goes to jail for several  years, and finally feels \\"free\\".  For all the pain and misery caused by his addiction to his family, friends, the crash victims and all those who tried to help him, he feels exonerated of his guilt and addition problem by his apologies written to all those offended.  This film portrays the influence of the current drug/alcohol addition culture in society and how that culture attempts to deal with the issues of living a lie and addiction by imposing more addictive remedy for the victim.  The redeeming feature is revealed finally when the addicted individual admits the truth to him/herself and society and can become free of the addition, denial and lies in their life.  The unfortunate issue raised by this film is that there is much truth about modern societies' dependency upon drugs/alcohol in order to function.  I gave this a three star rating due to the promoting attitude in the movie that addiction and alcoholism is treated with cocaine inhalation to bring about a semblance of \\"normal\\" function in a social setting, i.e. the NTSB hearing event.
B008JEJO88|5.0|I bought these because I was going to be going to a theme park.  I enjoy the way they feel, however like all Crocs they make my feet sweat so I usually wear low cut socks in them.  Overall though they were a good buy and great for quick errands or slipping them on to take out the garbage
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Loved it so much I sent a copy to my sister. Fast read, and worth reading again. I laughed and cried and laughed. Best money I've ever spent.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|Awesome story line and great cast. It's one I'll definitely watch over and over again! I highly recommend this movie for a good laugh :).
B00E9A656K|1.0|To win the Boss car costs $2.99 for just the first car.  Then you have to buy gas and coins to buy cars.  Be ready to sell your soul.
6305428042|5.0|Hocus Pocus is a very entertaining movie to watch with the family.<br />Everyone enjoys it, not just on Halloween, but anytime of the year.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Great book with some small problems. A good proof reader should have caught a couple of them.<br /><br />Problem #1: In two locations in the book Pendergast &#34;spins the barrel&#34; of a revolver-type handgun. This is not possible that I'm aware of.<br /><br />Problem #2: Pendergast inserts a cartridge into the barrel of aforementioned revolver. Shouldn't that be CYLINDER?<br /><br />Problem #3: I do not see the real need for A.X.L.P. to go into his super-trance and sit down with a table full of gamblers in the 1800s. It's a bit too far-fetched, even for him and, if he can do this, why couldn't he trance himself back a week or so and watch the murders/arsons happen and thereby solve the crime immediately?
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I love the series and appreciate not having to sit through commercials that interrupt the storyline. I'm looking forward to the rest of the stories when they come available.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|I like that you can play with friends over facebook and twitter, it is an all around fun game that pellet of any age can enjoy
B003Y5H54W|5.0|MUCH different version of this story than what I expected... more of a horror/detective story than a fairy tale. All in all I liked the film and would recommend it to anyone that isn't anal enough to require &#34;character development, well written anything, great directing, etc., etc., etc. in every film they see but can take it at face value as &#34;entertainment&#34;... if you like it... it's good. If you don't like it... it's not good!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun and addicting game. Although, there should be an &quot;UN-do option on the game:) other than that, the game is fab:)
B00006RAKP|5.0|Nice collection of most of the top hits. Easier to haul around than the five CD boxed set and just as many memories!!
B00BWQW73E|4.0|In the absence of a complete autobiographical account of Amazon, its key employees, and Jeff Bezos, I feel like this book did a fine job summarizing the company's origins, struggles, internal dynamics, overall business practices, and evolution.  I've read several reviews here from major characters in the book (current or former executives discussed in these very pages), several of whom disparage key details, the tone, factual inaccuracies, etc. and therefore gave the book low ratings.  To the public at large, for whom this book is written, it is the most complete account of the company to date and although I hate co-opting this phrase, Brad Stone's perception of Amazon is our reality - an aggressively ambitious juggernaut of a company, run by geniuses (one in particular), transforming gigantic commercial markets through technology and a patchwork of cunning business strategies.  Inaccuracies and dramatic tone notwithstanding, there is much to be learned about Amazon in this book and I, for one, appreciate the multiplicity of perspectives including current and former execs, employees, suppliers, and competitors - all in one place.  This book is not wholly damning or wholly praising in tone, just like Amazon's business practices throughout its history are not entirely despicable or entirely virtuous.<br /><br />Maybe some of the negative feedback provided by Amazon insiders in these reviews is triggered by a conscious or unconscious defensiveness that comes from feeling like certain chapters of this book paint the company in a ruthless, negative light and a fear that somehow, if this perception became prevailing reputation among the public, that Amazon would lose its place among the pantheon of cool companies to admire (because, as mentioned in the amazon.love chapter, &#34;rudeness is not cool&#34;).  Maybe it is time to own up to the fact that Amazon is not some kind of friendly, furry beast, and that in the quest for ultimate customer satisfaction, universal selection, and lowest prices, Amazon frequently gets blood on its hands in back alley retail knife fights (that it usually seems to win (sorry, that was not intended to be a pun on the Wusthof section)).<br /><br />My compliments to the author for painting a composite picture of what Amazon looks like behind those smiling corrugated boxes.  My satisfaction in reading this book had less to do with believing I had fully accurate play-by-play accounts of what went down in pivotal moments or who happened to have overgrown facial hair at what point in their lives, and more to do with learning about the cutthroat competitive dynamics in the retail trade and how this one company has so far succeeded against all odds through a unique combination of genius, guile, and perseverance.<br /><br />At least he didn't fall for the narrative fallacy.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|VERY interesting series. The ideas of mind control (mine isn't) is intriguing. I hope they continue the series for years to come!
068987751X|5.0|I bought this book 30 years ago for my son & have just bought a new copy for his partners 2yr old daughter.<br />It is timeless.<br />Within 2 minutes she was telling me the story. The story is simple and the illustrations adorable ( I love the grumpy camel ).<br />The pages are of thick paper so should not tear when a child lifts the flaps.<br />A great book.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|A clearly a top film, that will lead you to part 2? Anyway I hope so. After seeing it 5 times since I bought it I can sit down and watch it again, and find things that happen that you didn't see the  first or second time because of the intensity of the movie.
B000002KXO|4.0|I just checked Wikipedia to find out what was going on with the 2011 plans for remaster, and just read it's now set for 2014.  It would be nice if it was released January 1st.<br /><br />Anyway, this is what I read on the site:<br /><br />&#34;A remastered & expanded version of Mirage is to be released sometime in early 2014 by Rhino/Warner. A track listing for any extra tracks has yet to be announced.&#34;<br /><br />The four stars are for the songs as well as for ANTICIPATING the remaster.  I'll change it to a 5 when the thing actually comes out.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I love all the Star Trek Movies and this one is included.  I purchased as a gift for my Brother and they let me view it online too.  That was a really nice thing.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app does everything I need. especially once I learned how to change the settings with keeping the screen on all nite etc
B0093QE37S|5.0|They don't make movies like this anymore - where you can learn something at the same time as being entertained.  Just saw Kathyrn Hepburn's movie wardrobe on display in Appleton, WI, so I want to see some of her earlier films. Of course, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart are wonderful too.
B00GQ7OZR0|3.0|The show was never as good as some, like Breaking Bad, but it was usually pretty fair. They ended the series in an unsatisfying and what what seemed like a nonsensical way.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I use this app several times a day to check the current temp, plan for travel or future events, etc.  It seems very accurate, but can be confusing at times when it shows a high temp for the day and it's currently higher than what is listed.  (Same for low temps.)  It's a very handy app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Works well on my kindle fire.  Game itself is pretty fun if a little bit slow.  But strangely addictive.  Thumbs up.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun when your killing time sitting around !!! Just needs more options to get coins!! Also, is there a way to play with people you know? It's driving me crazy
B00DUGCLY4|1.0|never use this app it sucks it doesn't download and if it does it takes 50 minutes to load. lol
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I play on my Kindle Fire &amp; I love the aiming accuracy.  So much better than some games. I`m not very far &amp; should probably go back to increase scores/stars but I love seeing the next level.
1781162646|5.0|A great read, and Steven King is amazing. His ability to create authentic characters and weaver a story around them is unparalleled.
B009R659L8|5.0|Love all her books. They keep you sitting on the edge of your seat.Had a hard time putting this down! Thanks for all the great entertainment.
B00B7NPRY8|4.0|Well written science fiction. What you'd expect from a master like Herbert. A bit long for modern tastes. Read the book then watched the 1984 movie - book is better!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It was a lot better than the first one that's for sure. The attacks have a string of energy behind them and it is AWESOME
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|The cable doesn't work, I have to wiggle it to start charging. The tip is loose, and doesn't work every time. I would recommend looking elsewhere.
B00A83075M|5.0|Great story with a lot of heart.  I loved how they gave video game characters real emotional dimension.  Thanks for a movie the whole family can enjoy.
B0018QCXH8|4.0|I personally found this movie disturbing.  As a father watching the behavior of DDL, it really shook me up. The interactions, and lack thereof with his 'son', the evolution of the entire movie.  Very dark with no excuses, great acting, be prepared.
B008XG1X18|5.0|AWESOMENESS! It's really fun and family friendly! Over all just amazing! My favorite app. Great tips and funny quotes probably one of the best apps
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Classic Indiana the way it was meant to be.  A thrill ride from beginning to end, the movie was originally marketed as 'Return of the adventure story', it's constant thrills with no let up, and a great movie to boot.  Highly recommended!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a must read for any fans of the hunger games!!!it completes the story and still leaves you wanting more...
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|The definitive top-flight Hitchcock thriller is a rush from beginning to end. No break in the action, great plot with even better acting...Highly recommended!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really liked this game it is fun it was alot of fun hunting all those animals the best hunting game ever on tablets
B004W2UBYW|5.0|We only live once as far as we know. We better aim high and push all the way rather than just try. If we are here for something it is never to late to discover it. Humanity will thank us for doing it, not just dreaming about it.<br /><br />This book is about a human being that did what he felt it was right, regardless of what others might say.<br /><br />Excelent reading.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its fun but the minions cost to much money and it needs to get reduced down.when you die and the money 20 coins is to much it use to be 5 coins fix it
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|What's not to love about this series?  It's as good as the TV show, but we get lots more character development.  Castle isn't the best writer.  Sometimes his prose reads as though written by an adolescent, but I can overcome this simply because I like the books.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Ok. First of all. I love this app. I'm only 13 and love it. But i spent over 1000 getting gems.  Just to beat the game. Cause i have zero patience. But otherwise the app is super swaggy. Perfect for bronies everywhere
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I learned more about the details about WW I while reading an interesting story.  The characters had depth.  It was interesting to see how different people in different countries and in different walks of life were effected by the war.  I was a little bogged down with some of the details of the battles, but overall enjoyed it very much.  Looking forward to the next book.
1935251740|1.0|By page thirteen, I realized that Lanza has no idea what he writes about. Because we're not consciously aware of something doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. He may be a competent medical doctor, but his &#34;theory&#34; is ludicrous and makes it obvious that he's definitely no expert in physics. This book is poorly researched and written and is a complete waste of valuable time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is by far Grisham's best book yet. I could put it down and read it in two day<br />Super read.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|For the chapter on Judaism I watched the movie Schindler's List. This movie starring Liam Neeson who played Oskar Schindler, was based on a true story that took place during the holocaust and WWII. Oskar Schindler was a German business man who owned a company that made kitchen and cookware but was transformed into an ammunition plant for the war. In the beginning he was using the product of Nazi rule and Jews for free labor in his factory where he made a good profit. After realizing many of his employees were heading to death camps he bribes Nazi officials to keep Jewish workers in his factory and ends up saving many Jews by the time the war ends. This movie is very graphic and from what I have read and learned in the past about the holocaust it is unfortunately quite realistic. Schindler’s List is directly related to the Jewish religion and the attempt by Hitler and his Nazi party to exterminate the Jewish people and their religion. The holocaust was a terrible event but not a first in the long history of not only Jewish persecution but religious wars that date back to biblical times. Since the Holocaust the Jewish people have established a day of remembrance called Yom Hashoah.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This trilogy is very enjoyable and I love that it's not a typical ending. I don't want to ruin it, but my goodness the messages and the moral are great and its simply inspiring. Great series, definitely worth a read.
B008JFUS28|5.0|I LOVE this movie! The blend of action and comedy is well done. The story was interesting, and the further character development was great. Chris Hemsworth was born to play the God of Thunder, and Hiddleston as Loki was letter perfect. I particularly enjoyed the depth these two bring to their roles, the acting was superb. I was completely caught up in their complicated relationship. Good twists and turns, fun battles, beautiful imagery, well scripted. I am a long time fan of Marvel, and Thor was always my favorite charcter. I feel the movies really bring the characters to life. This movie rocked, I can't wait for Thor #3! (As a female, I just gotta add that Hemsworth and Hiddleston are sexy, amazingly gorgeous men)!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|You should keep producing games like this my child and I love this game so keep up the good work
B0035LMTZA|3.0|Great action, love those mini Coopers but plot and acting pretty thin. Second time I have watched, memory was better than the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love that it turns on my TV when I am ready to cast something. It just keeps getting better as Google and partners release new apps that work with it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A perfect choice of narrator for this story. A reminder of the power of the written word to move hearts and soothe spirits. I could (and will) read this over and over again.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Great album to relax to. Drizzy Drake is still doing his thing. Definitely have to go back and get the albums my collection is missing. I still do not trust the digital downloads I'd rather have the hard copy cause if a virus comes you hard drive is gonna be toast anyway with all your music and the Zune 3 time re download limit is not enough for me personally.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great page turner, enjoyed first two could wait to read the conclusion. I live booms that keep the pages turning and that give up no secrets.
B002BIULQ2|1.0|Boy what a disappointment she turned out to be!!There are none of my family that will let their children watch this sl** or wh*** ever which you want to call her and my daughter will not watch her anymore for the way she has acted in the past few years..Was a good thing and her Ky daddy ruined it all by letting her have her way and a lot of her relations here in Ky wont have nothing to do with her now and they wrote himoff when stole the song his brother wrote and called it his that he was the 1 that wrote achy,scratchy hurt!1 hit wonder and if it wasn't for his brother he wouldn't have made it as far as he did and now Hanna hotanna is not making it with a lot unless you are a male and she will give you what you want fellows!!A good night in bed from a lot of tales from different 1s I know thar do know the sorry thing!!I wouldn't touch a movie of hers or even look at it the way she is doing,she is no angel and glad Disney has dropped her and hope they don't pick her sorry a** up as an actor for anything other than a dog costume for the mating seaon og all dogs want Smirky !!She probably does daddy knowing her and I wouldn't place it pass her to do the producers of anything,see her in her next show,&#34;Miley Does Vegas Doggie Style&#34;!!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Spectacular action and effects but not much else. I found this movie to be tiresome, relatively humorless, incredible without being surprising.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Why is this game so much fun.Because of this text case I love the new features that are in the new version of this game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its great thank you so much!I yous it so much and its so cool thanks alot<br /><br />Ps.get this app<br />thanks
B009PMEEY2|3.0|This game is great fun, but after I completed all levels and went back to begin again with level one, a malfunction occurred.  Once completing a challenge within a level it often jumped backward and came up with an earlier challenge that I had already completed.  Fortunately, there's a way to advance the challenges and levels manually, yet it is frustrating, and I abandoned playing the game at all.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Great voice, beautiful songs very spiritual  and not bad looking too. It was just a great CD. That's all I have to say
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Ever since I updated uno, it's been slow and keeps freezing up. I lose my coins every time because the game freezes. It's annoying.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This is a great movie. Plenty of suspense and a surprise ending. I wish they made more movies like this.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|If you want a heart pounding story of survival against impossible odds, this is a story for you.  The absolute enormity of what they did is beyond incredible.  My vote for best survival story in history.  You won't regret buying this book.  It just teaches out and grabs you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank You , Thank You , Thank You for finally adding Candy Crush to kindle. Love this game. It plays really well too.
0141394811|5.0|such a wonderful, articulate and imaginative writer. full of intellect and wit galore. this was an AMAZING read and if you love the smiths/morrissey you must read it ASAP!
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|really weak , the characters were not well developed and the plot dragged on. Would not recommend and will not invest in other books by this author.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|For. my 3yr. old granddaughter and she loves it  She loves musicals.  She loves to dance and sing along. A movie that Grandma likes.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Just a great, warm movie with a great cast and good story. Wes Anderson's style may not be for everyone, but I've like almost all of his movies.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was easy to follow despite the two character narrative design.  You were able to empathize and feel as though you were a part of the &#34;times&#34;, understanding the position each character played in the hierarchy.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I play a variety of games daily and after a month or so the buttons and the joy stick - sticks and this is not a result of any food or drink residue.<br /><br />I do have the corded version of this controller and it works great.
B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|Fun game. Wish it would stop quitting every time I try to invite friends. Takes some time to g err t used to playing.
B00GO95TAC|1.0|Did they think nobody would notice such a dramatic price change? When I looked this morning, the price for The Day Of The Doctor was $3.99, and the price for An Adventure In Space And Time was $2.99. This afternoon, the former is $7.99 and the latter $6.99. That is exorbitant, firstly, and it also does suggest price gouging. I thought Amazon was better than this -- certainly, they stood to make plenty of money on these episodes at the lower price, and they got greedy. I buy an awful lot on Amazon, but I have to say, this makes me want to take my business elsewhere, and not just for streaming. Christmas is almost here, folks -- do you really want all Whovians to do our holiday shopping elsewhere?<br /><br />(UPDATE: These are the same prices as those currently at the iTunes Store. If Amazon got in trouble for charging too little in this case, a public statement would certainly be appreciated and would alleviate a lot of the ill-will that they've generated here.)
B00DCRE83S|5.0|this is an awesome cd from beginning to end. been crankin it in for past two weeks. get it you wont be disappointed
B00CNGA1PS|4.0|Great app!! The UI could use some work though. I haven't had a problem with it yet. if you're a frequent podcast listener like me, this has all that you need. I only take out a star because I feel like it could use use a sleeker look
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because. You are in a subway and you get cool people and a cop chases you around
B00G32OMF8|1.0|Really disappointing.........<br />The first one is absolutely the best film for me, and second one was stillinteresting.<br />But this one...... The constant fight against each other is something I really didn't wanna see...<br />It's exhausting to watch hearing their yelling all the time.<br />They met in such a romantic situation and the time they spent together was so wonderful, but this film destroyed those wonderful pieces... And the ending was very unrealistic as well.<br />It is a pity...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the most fun, as well challenging and addictive games I've had the pleasure of playing. Other games claim to be but they become almost impossible to win. Not Candy Crush. Many times, 5 more moves are really all you need!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I liked the movie and the concept. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is becoming a well rounded actor. I wasn't expecting much here but it was a pleasant surprise.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just a fabulous read! I would highly recommend the book to all readers.  This is a must read.  Great book
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Far fetched and crazy plot but action sequences were well done and worth the price for me.<br /><br />Not much to complain about here if you like these types of movies and don't question the plot holes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minion rush game is so FUN . O m g I am so in to this game<br />The vector battle is so EASY. I LOVE this game .
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|My favorite show ever on TV by a far margin. Season two continues to develop these amazing characters. So addicting I watch it marathon style.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|i like it its great and awsome so kool i love it cant live with out it super kool yea
B009FZFONO|2.0|I watched this show for two seasons. Used to be very well done and totally addicting. Stopped watching halfway through season three. The writing became awful and the characters unlikable. Such a shame.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i like it its great and awsome so kool i love it cant live with out it super kool yea
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Pretty decent flick thanks to Chloe Grace Moretz character kicking butt. If she wasn't in it I'd probably give it two stars.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Nice i like it its great and awsome so kool i love it cant live with out it super kool
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Although this is my favorite series on TV I give season one 4 stars because it took me about 6 episodes to get into it. By the end of the season I was totally hooked though.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|A great little app for kindle fire with wonderful detail on status and usage. I would recommend this app for all kindle fire and fire HD users looking for a nice battery monitor.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|Sorry but I couldn't get through this movie. Turned it off about 45 minutes in and I couldn't care less what happened after that. Ugh.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Of all the Mahjong games I have tried this is the one I continue to play every day.  The 3D effect is very good plus the tiles that can be selected are highlighted so you don't have to guess.  The graphics and symbols are as good or better than any other version.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Castleville is basically farmville on steroids, the amount of detail put into the game itself is amazing and its even more amazing that they are giving this game away for free and adding a bonus of 110 Amazon coins it's really quite incredulous, so get it while you can, because it's been free all the way, if a little slow sometimes. Hope my opinion helped :)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I take notes.  I make to-do lists.  I like to check things off once I compete my tasks.  This does all that.  And I can sync it with the one on my phone!  All the info is backed up so if I lose it I can re-install it and sync it to get my notes back.  Yes!!!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|A great, smooth follow-on to the previous Bourne sagas. It cuts in footage from the previous movies to tie them in with this one and explain why and how the black operations of our government devastate and attempt to destroy the morals of humanity of the black ops assets that they are creating and the stunning, casual, chilling manner in which people become totally expendable in a split second. The movie follows on the path of destruction that these agencies create once they have made the decision to &#34;roll-up&#34; a program and the utter lack of humanity. Given the recent disclosures of the behavior of the NSA and other secretive arms of the government, this and the rest of the Bourne series suddenly become not just fiction, but plausible explanations. Buy this DVD!! You won't be disappointed
0307352153|3.0|While I appreciated the author's positive outlook on introversion, I felt that she took an idea that would have made an interesting article and beat it to death in a book.  I also didn't care for her &#34;surprise!&#34; style of writing, in which she would describe at length someone's performance and success and then spring it on the reader that the individual was 1) herself or 2) someone famous that the reader is supposed to assume would be an extrovert. Additionally, she seems to take a lot of characteristics that are not officially markers of introversion and claim that they are, in fact, indicators that someone is an introvert.  In reality, we humans are much more complex than that. To understand introversion, the reader would be better off taking the Myers Briggs test. I would have rated the book lower, but my introverted friend and I had a lot of fun laughing at some of the things in it, so it did at least provide a couple of introverts an interesting conversation (yes, we do talk, we just prefer it to be one-on-one).  And it was amusing to see people in my book club compete to see who was the most introverted (except for the 3 of us who didn't say a lot).
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Another great war classic based around the events of the true Memphis Belle and the action she saw over France and Germany during WWII. Very realistic, with actual footage of B-17's in the war and some of the fighter scenes. You couldn't help but wonder if these kids were all going to make it home alive and wounded but repairable. Even knowing the outcome from history, this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, no matter how many times you watch it. It just grabs you and sucks you into the innards of that B-17 and keeps you there as a crewmember every time.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Hard to believe in parts but beautifully expressed. At a much older ageI have gone hiking with pack for similar daily distances up and down hills and her story raises some questions. If I am correct in my cynicism and story only 80% accurate it still remains a wonderful adventure. If it's completely true it is an amazing feat.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Been playing on and off, but I have always been impressed with its addictive gameplay and constant game updates. It is a required app for any tablet.
B00640UICA|5.0|I got this game as the FAOTD and I have still not finished it - I have finished the sequel though. I love this game. The characters are adorable and make cute noises. It gives me a lot of enjoyment to solve their puzzles and help them through the scary forest. In some ways the puzzles make me think of nuclear bonds forming, and maybe that was an early inspiration for 10tons. Based on the fact the sequel has a hint system, I am guessing people got upset that this version, the first Joining Hands, does not have a hint system. I am OK without a hint system, as if I really get frustrated I will go online and search up the solution. I hope 10tons makes a 3rd one and keeps making them indefinitely!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fun play<br />Good progression to harder levels<br />No ads<br />No upsells<br />No nagging<br /><br />Cons:<br />Gets laggy on my Galaxy Sii
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good read. The best in the series! Now on to watch the movie and 're-read the last book in the series.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|I was very happy to see this game in the shop. I have been waiting for another good one from Fire Maple since I played Lost City. This is a click-screen puzzles game, not a hidden object game. I completed this game in about 2 hours, which is too short for a paid game. Overall it was fun and challenging, but just way too short. I would give it 5 stars if had been longer like Lost City.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Beautiful<br />Good puzzles<br />No ads<br />No upsells<br />No nagging<br /><br />Cons:<br />Way too short
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down and I can't wait to read this whole series. Where have I been all this time? I was at the edge of my seat all the way through. Great story.<br />CindyKay
B009ZQGNPQ|3.0|This is one of the best done and most enjoyable series I have ever seen - we're behind the times and watched the whole thing this year, and I was talking about it to everyone - up until the last few minutes of season 3. I really feel like the writers were unnecessarily cruel to the viewer in that final scene, and I can't believe they would end the season on such a dreadful, depressing note. It's colored my whole feeling about the entire series - I no longer am a &#34;fan&#34;, I don't like to talk about downton abbey, and I would really prefer not watch season 4.  We're watching Upstairs Downstairs instead, where if they kill off main characters (at least so far) it's decently offscreen.
0321344758|5.0|It is clear and simple just how the book teaches us to be.  The order was also on time and book was in great condition
1449314287|1.0|Having looked into the new storage format for the DECIMAL data type, I used this as a proxy for the overall competence of the authors. They got it completely wrong, and in an obvious way, as they used the same example as the online documentation for MySQL.<br /><br />Not quite satisfied with dismissing the book on that one point, especially since there are 3 authors, 2 of whom may not have had anything to do with the above blunder, I read ahead a few chapters on storage efficiency, where they proclaim boldly there is little if any benefit to using bit fields instead of 8-bit integers. That sealed the deal. These guys are idiots with a VERY shallow grasp of the subject matter. When a book has this much misinformation it should be burned immediately, as removing misinformation from the mind is harder than putting it in. Just say NO!<br /><br />TOTAL AND COMPLETE CRAP.
B00GKS2HN4|1.0|Good game until you get bombarded with pop ups apps  that appear just as you click an item or spot, which take to app store . After  the 20th time of this,. I gave up and removed from my kindle.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am half way done with this book and I cant put it down. I like it better than the movie. I love the fact that I saw the movie shortly after buying this book because now I can see the caracters faces and expresions as I read the book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love all your games. please make more I always get the full game. I tell all my friends about these games.
0307743659|5.0|After reading &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;. I knew I had to have the original story.  I have seen the movie and the TV episodes, but neither compare to the book.  The &#34;Shining&#34; is a true classic.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is probably one of my favorite games because it is a game that is filled with excitement and is great for all ages
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This is an amazing movie, even if it doesn't follow the comics. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy play a great Professor X and Magneto.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|An excellent book, but one that doesn't spend much time with the consequences to society as a whole - rather just the consequences to one individual. Still, an intriguing read, describing a future that is actually possible in many ways.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this is one of my favorite games with tons of towers maps and upgrades. I like the music but I wish there were dart sounds.
B0081ISUOG|3.0|This is a basic and clunky alarm clock and timer app. I like \\"Timely\\" and \\"Alarm Clock Xtreme\\" much better.<br /><br />Regarding some of the complaints in other reviews, don't ALL apps sold in the Amazon app store require you to be logged in to Amazon for the app to run??? This is mostly an issue when Amazon pushes an app store upgrade and all your Amazon-purchased apps die until you login again. You can't really blame one app for a systemic problem with the entire app store.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is one of the best books of this book series!!!!!!!! I very strongly recommend this book. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did!!!!!!!!! 😍😘😍😘😍😘😍😘😍😘😍😘
0451521676|4.0|The book is a classic. Interesting how over time mysteries have changed and yet have remained the same in many ways.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|The ladle and spoon have a contour well adapted to scooping out the bits at the bottom of the pot.  And they all stay propped up as intended...unless you have a lot of food stuck to them.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I bought the 1-5 collection of the franchise [[ASIN:B00BFZBMDS Fast & Furious: 1-5 Bundle [Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]]] and my husband and I just finished up watching \\"Fast Five.\\" It was our favorite, although we enjoyed all the movies.<br /><br />Beautiful shots of Rio de Janeiro. Fantastic train robbery. The story was good - it wasn't just car racing but had a solid good guy/bad guy/$100 million dollar robbery in it.  Loved the vault chase - wow!<br /><br />My only complaint is no closed captioning on #5. I am partially deaf and it makes a big difference to me in the watching/listening experience. Lots of accents which were hard to understand.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Marino too irascible. Benton let down again by the Fbi. Kay overconcernd with family and self doubts. Not enough action. Cornwell can do better..  characters are becoming stilted.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|lives go to quick. love crushing the candy. and I hate to but more lives and I won't. Why can't I buy the game out right?
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|This ****** thing will not download<br />This thing got me vex the first time I downloaded<br />U SEE THE OTHER SUBMITERS THEY DO KNOW HOW FURIOUS I ****if this game had half a star I would rate it as that
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was happily surprised by how much I loved this book. I could not wait to read it every night. The author has a writing style that I really enjoyed and the storyline was exceptional. Lots of twists and surprises.
0770437400|5.0|One of the best and most engaging books I ever read. The movie sucked though. Each chapter of this book can be made into a breathtaking motion picture. The book was enough to give me a sunday, more thrilling than any summer blockbuster.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is such a fun game I would have made it a 5 star review. But sometimes it frezzes and messes up. But other than that it was a great game!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I avoided reading this series for so long because I didn't want to hear a tale of children forced to kill, but finally relented and I'm glad I did. The story is written so well that you can't put it down.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like the escape games and this one is a challenging but still fun game. Some issues but still a quality well made game.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|The app looks really user friendly, but every single time I try to play a video, the app stops and closes.
1442362537|3.0|I loved this book!  My problem was with the MP3 CD's.  I am very curious to find out if anyone else had a problem with the MP3's.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the MP3 so I would have it as soon as it came out.  However, EVERY track it played (and they were short and frequent), there was a loud CRACKING sound (which is why I had to stop listening; I thought it would blow my speakers).  Then, after the noise, there was a 36 (exactly) second delay before it started the audio.  Had the tracks been long, I probably could have put up with the noise and the delays...but every minute or two there was a new track.<br /><br />I requested a replacement MP3 a couple of days later, AND IT HAD EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM.  I finally gave up and just bought regular DVD's at a warehouse store.  Although I emailed the publisher with my concerns, I never received a reply.<br /><br />That being said, I LOVED THE BOOK.  I was especially interested with the AA tie-in, which I have always been curious about.
B004V9MU86|4.0|Written on a true story, which spans Hitler's rule, and life in a German village, with a lovely pa and his potty mouth wife.  Not being able to read or write, life was hard for Lisel, especially at school.  The writing is unusual, and it took me a while to get used to it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game.  I used to play in on my computer and am so glad that I can now play it on my kindle fire HD.
0307454568|4.0|Having to compare Stieg Larson's second novel, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" with his first literary effort, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" is perhaps a bit unfortunate. Larsson's second novel drags somewhat and does not have quite the intensity of his first novel. However, I have come to believe that Larsson would have made book two and three into one continuous novel--except it would have been too heavy to carry! I had book 3 waiting for me and did not go into Stieg Larsson withdrawals. It is with his third novel \\"The Girl Who Kicked a Hornet's Nest,\\" that Larsson comes full circle and brings all the loose ends together. It's intensity and the dynamics of the characters are superb. I highly recommend this series. I just wish Stieg Larsson had lived long enough to continue his series on future adventures.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|I had to quit reading at times because I couldn't see the words through my tears.  Oh, what a wonderful description of war and the destruction it brings.  God bless all those who suffered.  Thank you Markus.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Just enough brain work to be a challenge but not to be annoying.keep coming back to it to play &quot;just one more&quot;.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I can compare this movie to The Exorcist in the sense that in both cases you have the bulk of the movie with a child fighting a beast within or beside them.  I think this movie is better and while both have great special effects Insidious really doubles down on wild images in the last scene!  The ending was great because it leaves room for a sequel which has been made and I'd like to see.  It was pretty scary but I am not scared easily. Movies like Psycho scare me more where you just have an ordinary man going rip roaring crazy.  Ultimately for any fan of horror flicks or psychological thrillers I recommend this film.  It's killer (in more ways than one!)..
B001KTATIS|1.0|The story itself is ridiculous, if you are looking for something remotely historic, the story is even worse if you are looking for something entertaining. The controversy and hype surrounding this movie are all that has kept alive for so long. Please don't buy into the belief that it is controversial: porn movies are purchased with much cheaper price tags with similar story lines, less 'violence', better effects, and (sorry Peter O'Toole, Malcolm McDowell, etc. al.) BETTER ACTING!
B006GWO5NE|2.0|This was ordered with the fast  and works very well with it. why would Amazon ask for a review on a piece of wire????
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is the best production of Emma.  Unlike the more recent versions, with story content so condensed you can't get a feel for the story, this one retains the richness and fullness of the characters and story.  It remains true to Jane Austin's novel.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing book for readers of all ages. I will be buying several copies to give as Christmas gifts!
630542845X|5.0|One of the best movies out there.  A must see movie.  You will love it. Good movie to make you think.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My wife and I enjoy each episode.  The plots are very well thought<br />out.  Complex issues keep our interest high.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|It would be 5 stars if it would stay loaded.  I have to keep downloading it to get it to work for a day or two.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Since I've chosen to never buy cable TV (I have rabbit ears) this device is basically perfect. I suppose my complaint would be that streaming local media can be challenging, and I've had to restart it a few times which also requires new setup. Setup itself was very easy for me. Overall, for the price this gadget was a very worthwhile purchase.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|Didn't work for me. Main problem was the way Daisy was written, she just wasn't all that and couldn't figure why any man would worship her. She's pretty, but the writer needed to give her more umph in my opinion. Also not a fan of the voice over, filmmaker seemed to be telling me the story, not showing me. Acting was fine, sets were great. Even if story is about the illusion of love, that people can sometimes fall in love with the idea of love and not the real person, writer should've created a better illusion in Daisy.<br /><br />Gatsby seems an idiot, pining after some woman who'd willingly stay with an awful husband for the grand lifestyle he could provide.  This is my assessment of Daisy before Gatsby's reappearance. If the writer wanted to soften that opinion he should've introduced her as a loving (though glamorous) mother, then we could've given her an out for staying with her oafish husband for her child's sake. Later, she willingly allows another person take responsibility for a crime she commits. Not appealing. Nothing to her but a pretty face, nice figure and youth, all of which change over time.<br /><br />Instead of calling the story The Great Gatsby should've been called The Great Nitwit. Like young people everywhere Gatsby fell in love with beauty, and became blinded by his own love of another person, no crime in that. The problem is when he returns, older and presumably with some experience on him, he still insists on seeing Daisy the way he wants to see her, and not as she is. Basically, he failed to vet her character, to kick the tires so to speak. This mistake is excusable in a young person, but really problematic in a 35 to 40 year old mature man, apparently willing to risk his freedom for someone who doesn't deserve the sacrifice. In fact, if a person asks another or allows another to make such a sacrifice that should be a red flag right there.<br /><br />The audience needed to be seduced by Daisy, as apparently Gatsby is. The writer absolutelyneeded to attach us to her, so we'd be duped, just as Gatsby is duped but really Gatsby dupes himself. The story is an example of self delusion so I don't understand \\"The Great\\" part of the title (maybe another viewer can enlighten me). Since we're presented with nothing but Daisy's outer beauty, no way did I find her impressive or noteworthy in any way, and because Gatsby does everything out of his love for her, no way could I attach to him: a fully mature man who makes foolish, overly romantic/dramatic gestures out of blind love, or worse, stupidity and/or hubris.<br /><br />Gatsby is after all pursuing another man's wife, and they have a child, so he's breaking up a family.  By making the husband awful, the writer tries to soften what Gatsby is trying to do, but basically Gatsby wants what he wants and is willing to bust up a marriage to get it. The audience is shown that it wasn't much of a marriage, but apparently it was enough for Daisy, who showed no signs of leaving before Gatsby's appearance. Given his age and life experience, Gatsby should've known to leave all that mess alone.  He was far past 21, and yet refused to see reality (I hate when a writer presents a dumb character; a story can't recover from a dumb hero), and the filmmakers make Daisy seem more a lump of coal than a multi-faceted diamond, so it wasn't communicated why life without her wouldn't be worth living.<br /><br />This story needed to present Daisy as the essence of feminine appeal, in beauty and character, to explain and justify Gatsby's choices: she powers him, he moves the story. A weak Daisy provides no engine. Stars need to better assess screenplays not only for their own part but for the parts of the other characters who motivate them. A star's character does not operate in a vacuum, and is part of a whole, the most important part, but still just a part. Stars must look at the whole and question how all parts fit together. If not, you get stories like this: a hero who looks dumb for throwing it all away for an unworthy woman. A smart star would've looked at the Daisy character and insisted she be better developed to make her more appealing to the audience, not to compete with the hero, but so that when the hero makes the ultimate sacrifice (give up his freedom for her), the audience understands why he'd do such a thing. As written, we have an unappealing dumb hero, and nobody wants a dumb hero/heroine. We need better script assessment, and someone with enough clout to insist changes be made to a script when lesser characters aren't written strongly enough to carry their weight. What's a sign of a superior screenstory? When all characters bring added value. The main mistake here was underwriting Daisy.
B008602KQI|5.0|Absolutely amazing movie. Though, the way I hear it, the book contains much more detail that anyone who is interested in knowing more about the world in which this takes place should definitely read!
B008JFUPK8|3.0|The movie is not bad, but the lack of a digital copy... Ultra violet is not a suitable substitute, cannot be used with iTunes or downloaded.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game would be great for eight year olds. It is not very complicated but if you want to self-distract, or if you are stuck in line at the DMV , this could work.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Good, no, great service. Movie was good too. I would like to continue purchasing without becoming a &#34;member&#34; and you storing my personal information.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a great game. The objective of this game is to save the kingdom from the curse and free the people who are trapped there. You can buy buildings and explore places and sell items to other people who play this game. I love it!
B001EC2ISA|3.0|it is goofy fun and not bad for the time peiriod it was made...it is not a seriose movie and has a bit of dark humer...i got it to replace the old vhs...and it supliments the nasalga collection...not bad if taken for what it is...lol...
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Meh...love Charlie but this movie was borderline campy. Just barely OK. Lots of action but felt like I was watching a Godzilla movie.
0792839749|4.0|this was when movies were movies. long befor cgi or computers.the work for its time is intresting...and if you like dick van dyke it showcases a great entertainer.this is good collection piece.
B00FHATBGW|3.0|I enjoyed the story, music, and graphics. But I got all the way to the floral button and it would not place no matter what. So I removed and re-installed it. This time, I got stuck at the hammer and nails as others had as mentioned in earlier reviews. Finally figured out that if you tap the nails to the left of the ones to be hammered, it worked. So when I got to the button again and it still didn't work, I tapped the button beneath the empty space and it filled right in.<br /><br />So there is too much random tapping where you don't know what you are looking for, and too many non-intuitive choices. Also, instructions for most puzzles are useless. I skipped more puzzles because I got bored with random guessing (even the strategy guide said the puzzles were random and it couldn't offer a solution) or I couldn't figure out the goal. And I'm VERY good at puzzles.<br /><br />As for non-intuitive choices? In the bonus game, for example, who knew that bait for a demonic mouse (for that matter, who knew it WAS demonic?) is a hot coal? I spent a lot of time looking for cheese before resorting to the strategy guide for help.<br /><br />It's my opinion that you can't complete this game without using the guide, which is a sign of poor design and sheer laziness on the part of the designers. They need to fix a lot of the game logic and make it more intuitive, and make the screen more responsive and the interface more precise if they want me to buy the sequel, even though I think I will like story, concept, music, and graphics as I did with this one - which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1.
B000002O1P|5.0|Wish I would have bought this when it was originally released.  My husband heard one of the songs on TV and prompted me to buy it.  Great CD.  Timeless music.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this app on both my phone and Kindle Fire....so far it has saved me quite a few times. Timely info delivered when I need it most.
145210655X|5.0|Very cute.  I purchased as a Father's Day gift for a Star Wars lover.  Happy to give it and was enjoyed by the recipient.
B005XUC398|4.0|Emblematic of what happened in the crash -- and the background greed that spurred it without regard for the warnings that were given. A really good movie, but a little slow in places.
B007YJ8ZRK|3.0|I loved this movie up to the part where they became murderers; then it fizzled out for me.. I started dreaming about heaven and traveled far from the picture show; sorry, It could have been better without the murders, anger and insecurities.
0545586178|3.0|OK to good - as everybody says - not as good as the first - a little to overboard for me
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I watched this video many times; I live the players, all of them and the scenery and their travels...It was exciting to see this version of the end of the world: this country, other countries and all these people embarking on an unknown journey to safety.  This was a great movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just can't stop playing! Game is completely addicting but keeps your mind working. Not just a game of matching...it calls for strategic playing too.
B000I8G5B2|4.0|Ethan Hawke was wonderful in this futuristic movie; their technology was working fine and they live deliciously with it.  I think I would like this future; there is very little I would want to escape from.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One could not explain the greatness of this book..... John greens writing is unbelievable. It is brutally fantastic. By far one of my favorite books
B001O03NCW|5.0|Love the movie, love George Clooney, love the music!  I can replay the entire movie in my head while listening to the soundtrack.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved this game on Facebook and I'm so glad that zynga has made a mobile version . I love, love, love it!!!! Good work zynga. Thank you!!!
B000022TSH|5.0|Well, how doesn't like Chinatown? Great hollywood movie, good story and good acting all in one. I can watch it 100 times like it is the first time.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a really addictive and fun game if you have patience. If you can wait to gain crystals it is better than buying them, but you progress more quickly with a multitude of crystals. I could play this for hours without being bored.
B00003CXCW|5.0|A great movie to own. I am a big fan of old classical hollywood movies and i thought this movie was really good. DVD quality is great.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. Used to play on my iPhone and got really excited when I saw it on the kindle
B007SVPZMW|5.0|very basic, but one of my five year old son's favorite apps he likes to play this 2 player with me or his brother. basic but runs well, haven't had any problems, there are 3 different views, and it's animated so it looks like the x is being drawn instead of just appearing, works with wi-fi turned off, which is always a plus!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game to play!makes you think somewhat but sometimes can be very trying.very addictive but I only allow myself to play in my downtime or run out of lives!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very useful, the reading app I use most often. i like that I can now get library books from overdrive on kindle also. Controls are much easier than the other reading apps I have used.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun way to waste some time.  Little frustrating having to wait to move on sometimes. Would recommend game to friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is so addicting. If you want a regular life never pay this game. It will Ultimately<br /> steal your soul.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|i got this book only because it had lots of good reviews, what i didn't know was that i would fall in love with it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This was the best game I have ever played and my family is the best way to get the best game ever played in the world
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I love this book. It truly helped me to understand the extreme suffering that our country went through during those times. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Interesting and worthwhile in that it rehabilitates material from the March 1970 recording sessions, freeing the songs from the mixed-up confusion of the Self Portrait album and stripping out the too-polished overdubs. What we're left with is a surprisingly coherent collection of folk songs, oldies and originals. The music is hesitant, raw, and minimalist, but it has the ring of authenticity that was so painfully absent from the original album. There are also some great unreleased tracks from the sessions, the standout for me being the chilling &#34;This Evening So Soon.&#34;<br /><br />The other recordings in the collection are a mixed bag, and include a couple of live performances from the Isle of Wight concert, alternate takes or different versions of songs from &#34;Nashville Skyline&#34; and &#34;New Morning,&#34; and some other odds and ends from the time period. Some of it feels pretty unnecessary—particularly the Nashville Skyline stuff—but there are some gems here too, especially &#34;Bring Me a Little Water,&#34; &#34;Spanish is the Loving Tongue,&#34; and &#34;Sign on the Window&#34; with orchestra.<br /><br />Overall it's a solid collection for fans, and even newbies to the whole Dylan thing will likely find something to enjoy. It might have delivered a better bang for the buck pared down to a single-disc release, but I'm not complaining.
031623480X|4.0|have been on program for one month and have shown significant positive changes in memory and energy level with only minimum weight loss.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is not only a compelling story but the prose makes you want to linger. This is some of the loveliest writing I have read in a long time. It also lets you see WWII from a different perspective.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book. To me this is the best book of the series. Highly recommended. Keeps your heart pounding and on the edge of your seat.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It's okay, but it just doesn't do much (yet).  Overall, I use my Apple TV and cable box about 99.9% of the time, even though I would love to use Chromecast.  Just not much content here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites. The heart wrenching moments in the arena leave me thinking about this unforgettable story for days.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|phantastic image quality with Blueray! New Star-Trek experiance! I saw much more details in the movie than before with the DVD. A must for all Trekkies!
0156030306|5.0|Excellent story. Makes you happy, and sad. Teaches understanding & empathy and that all things are possible with faith.<br />Reminds me of a book I read years ago. &#34;Black Like Me&#34;
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is so awesome I recommend this to anyone, it is so fun I got this game a month  ago and I can't stop playing it! It's worth it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book; the story line, the characters, the style, everything. Anyone and everyone could and should read it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game!!! This game is very addictive. I love how the scenery changes. And how you don't need real money to play and get ahead.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so amazing that I have fallen in love with it.  I could play it all day all night it is so cool you gotta play this amazing game. And also I LOVE MINIONS especially Dave, he is the cutest minion I had ever seen in my life. I LOVE U DAVE and the other Minions.  =)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. Personaly it is my favorite book in the series. All of the twists in the book make it exciting. I love all of the new characters that are introduced. The end is the best part though. Tis book is a must read!!
B008JFUNTG|3.0|First off, I must confess that I haven’t read any of the original series written by Rick Riordan. My review of “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,” sequel to a 2010 fantasy adventure film “Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&#34; is strictly that of an avid filmgoer.<br /><br />As a film “Sea of Monsters” is not really that bad. The sequel has a good amount of action sequences and first-rate special effects (Colchis Bulls is pretty impressive). The film is about the new adventure of young demigod students of Camp Half-Blood, who are forced to find the legendary Golden Fleece, to revitalize the dying Thalia's tree.<br /><br />Logan Lerman comes back as a demigod Percy Jackson, a slightly laid-back hero with a sense of humor, who takes us through the story at a brisk pace. Brandon T. Jackson and Alexandra Daddario are okay as his friends Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase, although I think the film could have given them more to do in the story. The same can be said about the fiercely competitive character Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), demigod daughter of Ares, who could have been more interesting with a well-written backstory. Perhaps I should have read the books.<br /><br />Adult supporting actors include Stanley Tucci as “Mr. D” or Dionysus, and Nathan Fillion as Hermes. They are very effective comic relief, but even these talents can do little in a story that may be predictable for the fans of the genre. Director Thor Freudenthal (“Hotel for Dogs” “Diary of a Wimpy Kid”), who replaced Chris Columbus (who served as a producer here), did a serviceable job in continuing Percy Jackson’s story that somewhat starts to look familiar, but still entertaining.<br /><br />After all the sequel is fairly good, even though it has little to add to the popular genre of fantasy movies.
B0081ISUOG|2.0|Doors exactly what it says.  I'm surprised that people don't realize that call apps downloaded from the Amazon app store requires you to stay logged into the app store.  It's not an app issue.  So you can't blame this app for requiring you to stay logged into the app store
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|I guess I'm missing something.  Good reviews and pretty strong box office, so I rented.  I found this to be lame and boring.  There were very few laughs and you had to wait so long between them.  Nothing worse than a movie which tries and misses for humor, especially when stooping to the use of crude language and sexually gratuitous scenes.  Poor characters and weak premise to boot.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am a big fan of adventure game and this is one of the best one I have played by far. Would recommend this for children and adults.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Well written and best read in the five-book edition.  I enjoyed reading it and would recommend this to anyone that prefers the post-apocalypse genre.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it wakes me up every morning nicely it is great for kids and it even tells you the weather!!!there us somthing for everyone to love
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hey guys is now available on your kindle!  Go get it!!!  Go to your app store and get it for free!  But be careful, it really is addictive.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My granddaughters love this game.  Play it for as long as I will let them.  The colors are bright, the characters familiar from the actual toys the kids collect, and they challenge each other for how may points and coins they can accumulate. It's a very gentle and nonviolent game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Every time I decided to put this book down for the day, I found myself picking it up again.  Really enjoyed it.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Great game.  Mixes it up between hidden objects, scrambled letters, tell the difference in pictures.  I like it.  It's fun and interesting.  I got it because it was free, but I would have paid for it.  It keeps you on your toes trying to figure things out.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Are you interested in a page turner with a surprise ending? How about a little bit of love story with some humor thrown in? Add some slam bang action, more superheroes than a Marvel warehouse and you've got Steelheart. I can't think of anything Mr. Sanderson might have missed with this one. Maybe a sequel? Hope he's got that covered too!
1250038820|5.0|A gift for my daughter, who loves visiting New York City.  I think she will love this book!!!  This is just the book for someone who loves the Big Apple.
034580709X|1.0|After hearing all the Nesbo hype, I really wanted to read him and start from the beginning. I am now seeing my mistake. I don't usually read reviews prior to buying a book...call me dumb. This is an unreadable book. And I even brought in on a long flight. I had no CHOICE and I still couldn't read it. Poorly written, plot is plodding, characters not well developed...I dunno. Makes me think I could write a mystery. Should I try later Harry Hole books??
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Not sure what to say about this album. It might be if not my favorite Eminem ablum its dang sure close. would recommend for any Eminem fan or any Hip-hop fan in General.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has some gruesome seems, but it is very fun! I would recommend it for people that are not weak stomachs.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Frakenweenie was great!  i love watching it every halloween season and i am happy to have added it to my collection
140006922X|5.0|This is a fascinating look at Jesus the man and the times in which he lived.  It is a book by an historian looking at the facts, rather than a book based on religious faith.  Aslan is an excellent writer who knows how to bring his material to life.  I learned a lot about the religious beliefs and political situation at the time of Jesus' ministry, as well as learning a lot about the early history of the Church.  This book is written to appeal to the general reader, but there are 50 pages of notes at the end for anyone who wants to track down the scholarly research.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|funniest animated movie that has come out in a long time. i liked how it integrated other famous video games like pac man

B008B3MZNI|5.0|I never thought I would see this on Blu-ray so I am very happy.  The quality is pretty good for an old video source that I'm sure had<br />to really be cleaned up to look this good.  The sound is awesome!  I was 18 when Breakfast In America came out and the music<br />is timeless.  I played this music to death when I was young and I swear I felt like I was in a time machine while watching this<br />concert. The musicians are flawless.  Enjoy, I did.
1476734941|5.0|Awesome, simple read that reinforces the PBS program about a simple lifestyle change around eating less, that profoundly enhances health.  Makes logical sense.  thanks for taking the time to put it into book form.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Hysteria was a great album and seeing the entire album played live in its entirety is nice.  I also like the fact that they play<br />the first side of High n' Dry.  If you don't have it, get it.
B00FGM0IEU|4.0|I would give it 5 stars since I grew up in this part of the country (Sheffield) but I wanted to be realistic.  It moves rather slowly for most people.  However, I learned a lot about the caliber of artists that recorded in Muscle Shoals.  I finally found out what/who the Swampers are.  Proud of the music that has came out of my hometown community.  It is definitely an area rich with music history.  Thank you for making a film that tells the story of such a great musically rich part of this country. Sweet Home Alabama!!!
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This is an iconic performance by Nicholson and a great Kubrick film.  I love the winter setting and everything about this movie!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this series. It's gorgeous, twisty, incredibly well-acted and well-written (to be honest, I prefer the series over the books), has amazing costuming/sets/locations, and is compelling. It's also graphic (sex and gore), but I think that adds to the gritty feel of the series more than it distracts from the plot.
B00GSE96MA|1.0|Where is the actual &#34;Day of the Doctor&#34; episode? Will it be available to rent? Love the show and am trying to find it!
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|My favorite record of 2013. All kinds of styles, all solid and pleasing. Great lyrics about life and loving and music. A little bit of Lou Reed, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Del Shannon.  Kurt Vile is all his own here and he makes it sound so easy.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I have loved the Divergent series, but I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the series. While I enjoyed Allegiant as a whole and continue to love the strong characters, I have to say that a part of me was a bit angry with how some of the characters' stories ended. Allegiant is a \\"must-read\\" to wrap up the series, but be prepared to be thrown for a loop.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Additive and fun you get better at it the longer you play it.  You can find a little help online if you get stuck.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book overall. Was slightly confusing at the beginning when switching between characters and the roles they played but evened out and started to fall into place. Interesting ending.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Challenging first person shooter.  Cool and realistic  graphics.  Can't put the game down. For a free game deer hunter is a must.

B006T5C5PS|5.0|This is a very straight forward book, no nonsense.  I believe that the goal and method in this book is very severe, but that is what is needed for some who are very sick. Gerson diet is very much back to basic that more people should be using, maybe not quite that extreme if they are not faced with terminal cancer, but this would surely help anyone with need for any kind of nutritional support. Our modern medical care does not work, pills don't work, but this kind of therapy does, I worked critical care for over 30 years and during this time have changed my opinion of medical &#34;help&#34; and pharmaciutical &#34;treatment&#34;. Drug companies never offer a cure, just treatment, with lots and lots of side effects. Gerson therapy has documentation and proven help over and over. It's not an overnight read, and takes time to read to get all of his approaches and why, but worth it. Read this book, take time to study it, change your diet and your life for the better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I knew that this book was a keeper once I read the first chapter. The main character is Katniss and she is very brave. I couldn't put the book down and I can't  wait to see &#34;Catching Fire&#34; (second book of the Hunger Games) in theaters. Just for the fun of it I am going to read the whole series again. That is how good of a book it is, A MUST READ!
B0081ISUOG|1.0|This is an absolutely bare bones application with an unpleasantly minimalist interface. If you make an app and have a paid version don't have a top bar that highlights like it has a function and does nothing.

B00EQ30RVY|4.0|When I saw the first few clips of this lineup doing STP classics I thought they were doomed, mostly because it was just odd to hear Chester's vastly different delivery on songs like \\"Dead And Bloated\\".  Then I heard \\"Out of Time\\", and knew that it was just a matter of him finding his groove on their back catalog and not to judge too harshly just yet.  If the songs on this EP are an indication of what's to come I don't think they'll have any problems moving forward.  \\"Black Heart\\" is my favorite, sounds like a classic STP song to me, especially during the middle breakdown.  Cry Cry is my other favorite on this one, but I think they all show promise.  This EP was a great way for the guys to get a few songs out there to curb the curiosity (or doubt) for the fans who were on the fence about this whole thing.  I would much rather listen to new music from this lineup than hear Scott and his subpar band butcher the STP catalog.<br /><br />As a singer, I think Scott Weiland is phenomenal and it's unfortunate that things have gone this way because I really love STP.  However, the DeLeo brothers and Eric are obviously capable of making great music for many more years and should not squander their talent on someone who isn't a team player.  Scott has LSD (Lead Singer Disease) and seems to think he's more valuable than the others in his band (which has backfired twice now) and he'll most likely fade away into obscurity as a solo artist, playing small clubs and theaters as \\"The Voice of STP\\".  I'm looking forward to the first full album from this new lineup of STP, and Scott will live on in their back catalog.

B0000027RL|5.0|This album is an epic masterpiece that should be owned by every fan of music.  Not only does it contain some of the most personal lyrics of Eddie Vedder's career, but its sound is entirely unique from the rest of Pearl Jam's catalog, as well as from the early releases of their Seattle peers.  Beyond that it stands as a time capsule, and a sort of benchmark for many people who insist on comparing every new release to it.<br /><br />The members of Pearl Jam were essentially strangers when the songs on this album were written and recorded, and it's basically the lyrical version of Eddie Vedder's personal diary set to a soundtrack as raw and emotionally charged as the words.  This band is the metaphorical \\"phoenix rising from the ashes\\", as guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament were coming to terms with the tragic death of their friend and former bandmate Andrew Wood, while providing the musical foundation that allowed Eddie Vedder to share the stories of his confused adolescence, in turn allowing Eddie to overcome his own personal setbacks.  The result is an album that stands as an unmatchable standard to many people and the kind of debut that, for many bands, can kill any hopes of the kind of 20-year career Pearl Jam has had so far.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder is a masterful storyteller, which was instantly evident on the album's first single \\"Alive\\", the autobiographical tale of a youth growing up to learn that the man he thought was his father was not, and that his real father had died years before.  The other singles on the album were \\"Evenflow\\" and \\"Jeremy\\", but every song on the album is strong enough to have seen success as a single.  This is the only album to feature original drummer Dave Krusen, who had to leave for personal reasons shortly after the album was recorded.  Ironically, Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, who played on the 3-song demo that was sent to Eddie Vedder, eventually became their full-time drummer with the longest tenure to date.  Like every Pearl Jam album, Ten does a great job to showcase each member's style and talent.  I love Jeff's bass on Jeremy and Why Go and love both bass and guitar work on Garden.  The guitar solos on Alive and Evenflow are very memorable and while already impressive on the album, the song \\"Release\\" really shines live as Ed's vocals soar.  The growl in Eddie's vocals on songs like Deep, Once and Why Go are more prominent on Ten than any future release.<br /><br />This album has a very polarizing effect for many people who either write it off as sounding too commercial in comparison to early efforts by Nirvana and Alice In Chains or Soundgarden, or claim it to be so untouchable that Pearl Jam has yet to make another worthy album.  I'd have to argue that a catalog including 10 studio albums and a career spanning two decades with no signs of slowing down proves naysayers wrong.  \\"Ten\\" was a monumental beginning for Pearl Jam and these songs still sound great 20+ years later, especially live.every Pearl Jam album, Ten does a great job to showcase each member's style and talent.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A Good book, but if you read the first one 15 years ago it will be hard to put the two together. Otherwise it was a fine book, the way John Grishams usually are. I enjoyed it. Just not as much as I thought I would.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Terribly boring book. I mean boring. I started reading this series because my 16 year old daughter really liked it and wanted me to read it. I actually really liked the first two books and found them entertaining. Allegiant though falls so far away from the standard set forth in the first two books that it's embarrassing. The worst part is this took her more than two years to write. What was she doing? I found myself reading this and inserting my own missed moments of action or excitement: that would of been a great time for fight scene; that would of been good plot twist; that would of been exciting if that happened.... Instead your left with the constantly mundane emotional and relationship concerns of Tristan and Four. Pages and pages of crap. Like many of the people here who gave it bad reviews - I'm not doing it because of the &#34;sad&#34; ending it didn't bother me and I could see why it was done. What bothered me more was that I really didn't care at that point- I literally just wanted the book to end so I could read something good.<br /><br />My daughter who, as mentioned, is a huge fan of the books is so bored that she's stuck on page 280 and she can't push herself to read more than a few pages at a time before she loses interest.<br /><br />I got to wonder what the producers of the Divergent movie are thinking. They jumped on this series hoping it would be a huge success like the Hunger Games and then she's ends the promising series with this time waster. If the movies takes off it will be very interesting to see what they do with this third book. It could be interesting because they would have the opportunity to actually make the movie 100 times better than the book which really never happens.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I loved playing Magic years ago while in college and it is nice to have rediscovered the game again.  It is especially nice that the tablet keeps score and does all of the housekeeping allowing the player to just command the board.  Great adaptation of the game.  This is a perfect game for thinkers versus just shooters.  :-)
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great Movie that I rather watch at home more than once vs. going to the theaters more that once. Condition is as promised from an already excellent marketplace
0739324489|3.0|CD/abridged/Thriller: I'm giving the abridged audio only three stars, probably two & a half.  Why? Because is was missing too much.  The abridgement was in four discs and should have been five discs.  I found an old ARC copy I got in a thrift store and there are whole chapters of character development missing.<br />If you want to read this, either get a unabridged copy or paperback.  Skip the abridgement.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham readers will not be disappointed by Sycamore Row. A little slow in middle but beginning and end are solid
0440242401|3.0|It took me a while to get into this book. When I was 120+ pages in I considered giving up on it, but all in all I'm glad I finished it. It's not the best work Kinsella's done, but I liked it. I wish there would have been more romance in it, though. I loved Jon but I felt like Kinsella skimmed over his character, and their relationship. I don't know if I'd read it again because of this.<br /><br />I would advise you to pick up a copy at the library before you buy it, as there is a very real possibility you'll be disappointed.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|Wonderful Movie! Funny Sad and True. This Movie Broke My Heart. Didn't Get the Credit it Deserved. It Was a Heart Breaker!
0385342039|5.0|This is one of my favorite books Kinsella has written—and I've almost read them all; I just need to finish up the Shopaholic series, The Undomestic Goddess, and Wedding Night.<br /><br />It starts off really slow, and at first I didn't think I'd like it at all. But I ended up falling in LOVE with Sadie, and also Ed and Lara's relationship. Sadie is hilarious and witty and it's fun to see the modern world in the eyes of a twenties girl. Lara is likable, but a teensy bit annoying sometimes (which is a good thing in my opinion; no one likes a perfect and pretentious character.)<br /><br />And there ends up being a twist in the story—involving Sadie and her lover she had many years ago—that I didn't see coming at all, and it kept me turning pages until two in the morning.<br /><br />The ending was really sweet. I'm happy with the way Kinsella wrapped it up. I rented a copy of this at the library, but I'm going to order my own copy of it ASAP. I can't wait to read it again!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Clary and her friends go to Idris, the glass city, to find the cure for Clary's mom to wake her up. But things don't go as planed and soon they have to worry about more important things than the cure. Valentine once again has come up with an evil plan to destroy the Clave and has some help from a dangerous person this time.<br />I think that the books in the mortal instruments series just keep getting better. We finally get to know what kind of experiments Valentine did on Jace and Clary and why they have there special powers. This book was the most exiting and interestin one in the series but who knows, maybe book four will be even better... then i definitely have something to look forward to.
B00C1040TO|5.0|This application does exactly what it says, works well on the ascoustic guitar and on the Android tablet. Thanks for the aid
B003G4W49C|5.0|Definitely a great science fiction story in which, through Ender, we see what could happen when children are employed by the military to carry out the impossible task of eliminating an extraterrestrial enemy. There are many aspects of humanity (and also alien species' morals and codes) that are touched on- ageism, overpopulation, propaganda, military strategy, child psychology, family ties, and the list could go on and on. It makes me excited to see what happens next
B007SGM084|1.0|if I read the words \\"murmer\\" or \\"mumble\\" in another book I will burn the book, shove it into... well....I will try to find the author and remove any means of further writing. This is the most insipid and poorly written book(s) published in .......eons? This illiterate woman (James) should be forced to read her own trash until she begs for a<br /><br /> writing class!
B004XIVQ7Q|5.0|i really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of his books have started Forest and finding just as good
006202406X|4.0|Original review here: [...]<br /><br />Since 2011, youth across the country have been fascinated and enthralled with Veronica Roth's bestselling series, Divergent. In a world full of YA fiction ranging from questionable to downright preachy, Roth brings new elements to the table: a lovely balance of realism and enveloping storytelling one can't help but fall in love with.<br /><br />The story begins with Tris and Four making discoveries about their city that no one ever even had an inkling about. The two warring sides clash immediately, and the ensuing danger leaves Tris and Four with critical decisions to make. Decisions about the massive revelations and the impending war inside the city's fence threaten to throw off their entire existence, but then dire circumstances force them to go outside the fence in search of what lies beyond.<br /><br />Veronica Roth moves her plot along nicely. So nicely, in fact, that I personally mourn the loss of skill and talent in today's YA market-or the market in general. Roth carries about herself a presence of knowledge: knowledge of her world, her characters, her own identity and skill level. Each tier of certainty shines through until I forgot I was reading a work of fiction. The world and plot build up organically, like a mental pop-up book. This being the end of a trilogy, part of me was incredibly hesitant to get to the end. The vast majority of series suffer from Bad Ending Syndrome (BES), where, for reasons unknown, the author throws anything they can together to pull all the loose threads into a cord that quickly frays and reveals the haste-waste. Roth came around with the origins of her world without missing a beat, and by the end of the book, I felt whole and complete, like I had missed nothing and everything had fallen together. That being said, parts in the middle did lag a bit; plot-wise or not, it could have been tightened up to make things progress more quickly.<br /><br />From the very first book, the biggest facet in Roth's distinct style is her use of real characters. Today's market--no matter the style, genre, age group, or whatever--suffers from an overabundance of perfect people, surface conflicts, and unbelievable situations. For instance: a beautiful, kind, talented girl who doesn't think herself beautiful, kind, or talented falls in love with a mysterious, handsome, secretly-kind boy who tells her otherwise, and they proceed to solve problems come the turn of a page and live happily ever after. Roth destroys this archetype. Her characters are so real, you could expect to walk into any store and see them there. They are flawed, average-looking, talented in unique ways, and always searching for something to make them whole. Within the series, Roth touches on what that Thing is: God.<br /><br />Veronica Roth has never hidden the fact that she's a Christian from any of her fans. What makes her so relatable and believable is that she's a Christian who lives as Christ did: hanging with the outcasts, never preaching directly in someone's face because she thinks they need to hear it or they're going to Hell, always letting people discover for themselves how God is speaking to them through her work. This infusion of reality and faith hits the spirit hard, and this is exactly what Christians need to start doing. We need to set a standard that's far from rose-colored stained glass and be real with not only ourselves and everyone around us, but with God Himself. Roth has begun a precedent I respect highly and strive to follow myself. She has my utmost admiration.<br /><br />Allegiant has zero blasphemy when it comes to cursing; only scattered cusses dot the pages, and characters never use the \\"f-word\\". The only sensuality to worry about is Tris kissing Four. One character drinks alcohol due to grief over lost friends, but nothing is promoted or glorified. The only thing prevalent in Allegiant is violence; Roth never glorifies or shows explicit pictures of the violence enacted. Guns, knives, fists, and bombs are used as weapons.<br /><br />Though the Divergent series has closed out, I find myself incredibly satisfied by Roth's method. Tris' world will forever live in my heart, and I can only say a thank-you to Veronica Roth for letting the story tell itself instead of dictating what was to happen. The end is already written. Writers simply have to listen to find out what that ending is--no matter the heart-wrenching costs.s, knives, fists, and bombs are used as weapons.<br /><br />Though the Divergent series has closed out, I find myself incredibly satisfied by Roth's method.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really thought this comedy show was great. The ending joke was especially funny. This funny looking British guy is driving home from his baby-mama's house when he crashes his old timey car. He wrecks it and takes a nap right in the ditch. Anyway, if you like Classic British comedy this show is for you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it! It is so addictive! I'm 18 and I fight with my baby cousin to play it! He's five and got be addicted. I can't seem to put it down.
B006MW3VGA|1.0|Even though this is an amusing comedy, it was annoying that there were several historic inaccuracies. First of all World War I began in 1939 after Mussolini invaded Poland. Next, the great Influenza outbreak began in 1980 and ended in 1982. They did get right the number of people who died, and the general effects of the disease. Other than that it was a very good Britcom.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Been using it for a long time and decided it is a &#34;must have&#34; on my Kindle tablet. I am new to a tablet but look forward to using my Yahoo email account when I travel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much for. My daughter and I have such a great time playing. It is totally addictive. Everybody should play just to relieve stress.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I had fun and I'm still having fun With with this game. The different type of missions and mass variety of weapons and attachments for your guns which can very from assault rifles to civilian side arms and from wimpy shotguns to 50. Cals. What I also like about it is that your stationary but you can adjust your Angle to the animal by moving left and right. The only thing I dislike is that you must download every other region and it takes a whole other gig to download all of them. But despite that the game is entertaining and keeps you coming back for more.
B005LJKEXS|1.0|Too short, it was advertised as a 10 m cable but was only 5 m long.  I sent it back.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love this game its rotten described as a 2d minecraft with allot of added blocks weapons and other unique things. Tons of bosses and enemies loads of places to explore a way to create and customise your character. With thousand  of options this is a way to give up 3d like minecraft and have an amazing 2d adventure in this blocky pixlated world. Another thing is that it has a tutorial so people who are new to the game can experience the game without flaws.  Yes the PC and Xbox at a higher update but this is still a great game. The only thing you don't get is a difficulties change or a creative mode and no chat but it's mainly single player on mobiles anyway and you can kick people from the game if you don  want them there anyway but the game is fun from beginning to end.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|My favorite book!  Very Informative and entertaining to read as well.  Not just a book for those in business…there is something for everyone to take away and find benefit in their own lives.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I got this on the iPad, where it didn't require Facebook. It requires Facebook on this, so I can't play on my Kindle.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I think this is a very good game, but it would be the BEST GAME EVER if there was multiplayer with servers and everything I and everyone else in the world would be SOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the best series I have read in a long time!  I hope he keeps writing more romance books like this!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Once again, David Baldacci published another very good and suspenseful novel about Michelle and Sean.  Although I am only about 60% through it, I have found it hard to put aside for other necessary things.
B00GQ4P1Y4|5.0|Awesome Movie. I was in High School in 1986 and actually saw one of the first airings. Lots of action / FX with good comic relief by Bill Paxton. The only thing I thought was a little hokey was the whole being stranded on the planet. Not very good military tactics to send everyone from the ship to the surface leaving no pilots on board the Sulaco. Anyway, I guess it added to the suspense. Right up there with Jaws, Close Encounters, and Josey Wales in my opinion. A real Sci-Fi classic.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|The game works well on my Kindle Fire HD. I never got into Terraria on other platforms, but I can see why it's so cool. I enjoy building things and fighting monsters so far. I love the retro graphics and the crafting portions of the game.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Good Movie. I found it entertaining and worth the watch, especially compared to some recent haunting / possesion movies. I would watch it again. Maybe next Halloween. :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Once I got this game I fell in love with it!!  I like the bapple hunt every day! I can't wait to play in the mall location! I totally recommend you to buy this game! You can punch minions in the face and get a bonus!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|You cant get away from it. Once  you play it, it is in your bloud, you love it and hate it at the same time.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Good writing many of todays T.V. and move stars appeared on this series. Nancy Drew in modern times good acting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this in class all the time. It's great for on the go and when class gets just too boring to care! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT! You hardly ever need WIFI which is a major plus! Worth your money.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the sadest books I have ever read.yet somehow I can not bring my self to regret having read it.It's like sitting for your exams...while the process may involve a little heartbreak you come out wiser at the end.So I can not bring myself to dislike this book though it tore my heart...I kinda LOVE IT!!!
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Finally, my almost 4-year old grand daughter came over & played this game. That's who I downloaded it for. It's kind of hard to figure out what to do (even for me; I guess I'm a doe-doe! She's not). But, she was still interested in it & it kept her attention for a short while. It's okay.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Its the hightlight of the day.<br />I recommend it for anyone who wants to challenge their mind.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I don't play games much because I'm too busy reading or cross-stitching but this is a really fun game!!!!! I love the music too!
B009NF54ZE|3.0|I enjoy the different puzzles in this game. It is challenging but not too hard. Good time killer. Ran my battery low because I couldn't stop playing. Glad I was able to skip the dialog.  I hope everyone enjoys playing this game.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|This is a historically significant collection of songs. What other shipbuilding town has such ballads and reels to her credit? None and Nowhere!  Sailors I have known and read about leap out of these songs into my mind. This album was so beautiful it made me smile and cry. Cheers to Sting for celebrating Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle in time.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|This game is worth your money. It's Fun and there's many shapes and colors to choose from. Me &amp; my sister play this a lot. We love it! I suggest buying this app for spin art. It's great (:
0307352153|1.0|It was more like a history book (although I didn’t check the accuracy). If you want to learn more about Rosa Parks, the Roosevelts,…go for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can play this game for hours at a time and not care about anything else. I love this game!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Not as good as his other two books. It had a slow patch but still had to finish it. Looking forward to future books.
B007QXWV1U|5.0|I love the photo lab pro!You can make the most amazing photos with it! I plan on using this app alot!It works well on the Kindle Fire HD
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Ms. Moorjani makes a lot of sense.  Whether it cures a disease or not, it's a good way to live.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Although this is like my third time restarting the game from scratch each time is like the first so I just can't stop playing.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|this game has a weird glitches in the game. it wont let me select a match when they are like right next to each other and it is so ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />it was at least a little fun and so I am rating it 3 stars.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Although I haven't figured out how to post videos yet with this app I can do everything so I definitely enjoy it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good fast moving story line. There is a mystery component to the whole tale. However, I don't think I particularly sympathized with the main character - he came across a bit superficial. Overall an enjoyable read but probably not the best work by Grisham.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Excellent game for grandson 6 y.o, 9 y.o and adults. Would recommend highly recommend to anyone looking for a game that stimulates thinking.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I adored this film.  There is something about this boy, when he pours himself into the the choreography...it was breathtaking and raw.  I felt his anger, his fear, him frustration and his joy.  Jamie Bell was just brilliant.  Julie Walters was a great support and I enjoyed seeing one more layer to her acting, fabulous as always.  I also appreciate the way the film dealt with so many types of love and how each person hand to discover how to share it.  I did forget...until I watched it with my mother...how much cussing is involved!!!! oops! So just a hint of a warning for those of you with sensitive ears, but don't let it detour you from this amazing film.
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|I finished this book 4 days ago! But I couldn't let it go. I kept coming back to the finals of the fourth book when Jake took his turns and the two last chapters of The Dark Tide. The ending of this last murder case was brilliant by wrapping the investigation/case - Adrien shocked by Argyll's decisions facing his closeted issues and what could might have been if Jake hadn´t come out. How many Argyll´s hide their feelings in order to get rid of society pressure. I loved their intimate moments and suffered with their problems to get ends meet. Wow! it was e hell of a ride and i'm taking my chances in another J. Lanyon book! No need to say I loved all the series.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I am young, but a huge Cary Grant fan...love his expressions and physicality...there is nothing like a good old movie with both Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant involved!  I don't know how I missed this one for all these years...but so glad I watched it now!  This is where new movies got all the goods from...
B0083SBMBM|3.0|There is something wrong with the disc, as the movie kept pausing at random, quite often and lasting anywhere to a second to ten, throughout the movie. Sadly, since I bought it so long ago and only watched it recently, I can't return it (plus I don't want to deal with amazon charging me to send me a replacement, since I don't have Prime)<br /><br />I am sure I would have appreciated the movie a lot more without that.
B000000OF6|5.0|His music is very unique and new to me. His background music was different than most, as well as, his enthusiasm!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first season - having a tough time getting through it - can't wait for season 3.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John has a special sound and style of his own.  I have always like all of his music. I hope he continues to make unique music of his own!
0316247545|5.0|It's for anyone who likes my little pony not just little girls or little boys or bronies it's for anyone! The pictures are fantastic, it's just full of interesting facts that perhaps you didn't know before! There are all kinds of cool things and ponies that maybe you didn't know their names before. it's just very interesting and it has nice glossy pages!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game love the thermal and the extra cash for heart and lung shots also the upgrade layout is good but the game could have a way to go to upgrades strait from the shop or if there is I have not found it
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very cute game, love the graphics. A nice game to play on my down time. I would recommend this to any one that lives to play this type of game.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This had me from start to finish. Typically Grisham, you new where you were going but had to keep reading to see how you got there. Well done, his best in quite a while.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is the boss! Asphalt 8 Airborne is THE BEST racing game on the market! Although it takes up a lot of storage this game is a must have! The graphics are unbelievable!<br /><br />  GET THE GAME and buy the Lamborghini Veneo my favourite car!
B003B02O0A|5.0|Had to read it first before Sycamore Row. Glad I did. This is a must read in my opinion. Grisham is terrific.... now on to the next.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book cannot wait to read the next chapter.  Your writing is so exciting.  Thanks for some great books
1594202842|5.0|I really enjoy the conflict between East and West parenting styles that are described in this book. I found myself both liking and disliking the author at different times. In the end I really think that more American's should read this and the pendulum of parenting styles should swing back the Chinese way a bit.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I thought this was an engaging and quite well-acted film. The two kids were right out of Huck Finn, and I enjoyed M M's lean and distant look. Sam Shepard is disturbingly authentic in most all of his quirky, hard-bitten roles, and this is no exception. I would have like to see more acting from Reese Witherspoon, though. The script doesn't give her much to work with.
0060833459|5.0|The late Peter F..Drucker is the Lincoln of Business Management gurus and his advice is second to none. His book titled the &#34;Effective Executive&#34; is one of the best of his over 150 publications.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|297 pages!? ONLY 297 PAGES?!?!? WHY IS THIS BOOK ONLY 297 PAGES?!?!? This book was too short, and it went by so fast. It’s depressing.<br /><br />I had no idea what the ending would be like and I certainly didn’t expect this ending, but it was kinda sorta perfect. I’m content.<br /><br />And this book was so good, too. Which is especially rare of me to admit about the last books in series. This book was so good that I woke up at 3am from dreaming/freaking out about how it was going to end. And then I realized that I couldn’t fall asleep not knowing….so I finished the book at 3am and went back to bed. Ha.<br /><br />So Alex is recovering from her unexpected vacay in Olympus….and she’s really messed up. And she’s sorta crazy. For real though, Alex is, like, certifiable.<br /><br />So at this point in the series you should pretty much know that a war is inevitable. So what does Alex do? She needs to prepare for the war and to somehow kill Seth/transfer his power to her/kill Ares. All that sound pretty impossible until we realize that Seth was pretty broken up about Ares torturing Alex and he suddenly comes to the good side. YAY! I always knew he had it in him!<br /><br />But Alex, Aiden and the rest of the gang still don’t trust him….with good reason. Soon they realize with Seth’s information about Ares that they will need a miracle or a trick up their sleeve in order to beat Ares the God of War. Well, crap, they hardly have any options….except one. Which is stupid and really dangerous: Unleash Perses the Titan…aka the ORIGINAL god of war and destruction. Yeah, that’s going to go well…aaaaand I don’t want to give any spoilers, so that’s all I’m gong to say about the plot. ;)<br /><br />This book was everything I didn’t even know I was deprived of.<br /><br />I still love love love Aiden but he TOTALLY took a backseat in my mind when I realized Seth was back.<br /><br />OMG, SETH. I didn’t realize how much I missed/loved Seth until this book. But I was, like, so excited to have him back. SO EXCITED.<br /><br />And Apollo?! He is like a fine wine, he gets better with time. I swear. He was so hilarious in this book. Pretty much everything he said I was actually laughing out loud. LOVE HIM.<br /><br />And can we please take a moment to appreciate all of the Aiden/Seth moments? THEY ARE GOLDEN. LOVED THEM. I seriously missed those snarky SOBs duking it out. Also, I think they have a secret bromance.<br /><br />This may be a spoiler-ish….but JLA just announced that Seth has his own spin-off series!!!!!! AHHHHH!!! Thank the gods.<br /><br />I think I would have died if there wasn’t something else. And it’s a good thing I didn’t read Sentinel until I (accidentally) found out that Seth has his own series, otherwise I would have been flipping out the entire book. And apparently it's not YA. She’s considering it New Adult, but of course it would have to be New Adult with all the shenanigans Seth gets into….<br /><br />But FEBRUARY 2015 RELEASE DATE?!???! IT’S SO FAR AWAY!!!!! I DON’T THINK I CAN WAIT THAT LONG! PLEASE, JLA, GIVE US A TEASER ASAP!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Broadchurch is addictive - I was hooked after 5 minutes.  David Tennant is great and the story kept me guessing until the end.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|There was so much I didn't care for in this book, and after 200 pages of reading about  vomit, farting and being &#34;sick&#34; in her mouth, shoe, etc., I gave up. I don't think that social networking has a place in fiction, at least not as much as we get in this book. It's rare that I don't finish a book, but there was no point in going on. I did take a peek at the end to see who she ended up with, but I didn't really care.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Deal of the day! Well worth the price. No commercials, unedited, and better that anything currently on television.  Don't hesitate, buy today.
B00GU4E920|5.0|i love this show and many others.but if im going to 80 bucks for instant prime I want to watch this show without having to pay extra.same as all other shows!
0061673730|1.0|First off, I finished the book, all 531 pages of it.<br /><br />Second, the only reason I'm giving this book such a low review is because I believe it misunderstands a lot of Platonic philosophy.<br /><br />The book radically and falsely reduces who Socrates is and what Reason is, and I believe this is caused by Phaedrus' misinterpretations of Plato's works, which he only seems to dive into while looking for support for his own ideas. Phaedrus starts in undergrad as a student of natural science, takes a detour into Hindu philosophy, teaches college English, develops his own metaphysics of Quality, and then - only then, in the last 100 or so pages of the book when he enrolls in a graduate program - starts critically and thoroughly examining Plato. And this is the problem: the assertions he makes about what Socrates thought are RADICALLY different than what I think Socrates thought, and I am a Classics student who is also now in graduate studies. Whereas I've read (so far) about half of the dialogues Plato ever wrote, Phaedrus only mentions two, which are assigned readings for his course: Gorgias and of course Phaedrus. His assumptions about Socrates' method (the same assumptions he uses to completely debunk Socrates and &#34;remove the halo&#34; from his head, in his words) seem to be based on only these two works.<br /><br />This is where the problem comes in. If Pirsig had read the other Socratic Dialogues, he would have seen the fact that Socrates also believed in a transcendent idea which formed visible reality and is beyond explanation. We read in the Timaeus: &#34;Now that which is created must, as we affirm, of necessity be created by a cause. But the father and maker of all this universe is past finding out, and even if we found him, to tell of him to all men would be impossible.&#34; That Pirsig so quickly and completely dismisses Socrates, especially when Pirsig actually agrees with him on so many points, obviously does not bode well for his argument or his standing.<br /><br />Perhaps worse is the fact that Pirsig assumes Socrates' main goal is just to chop people's arguments into little ribbons, for some unexplained sadistic pleasure. &#34;Dialectic - the usurper... muscling in on all that is Good and seeking to contain it and control it. Evil&#34; (pg. 476). He further states that in Socrates' view, Reason is subordinate to Quality (461), and even more incorrectly assumes that Plato &#34;made aretê the Good, the highest form, the highest Idea of all. It was subordinate only to Truth itself&#34; (487). But Socrates actually equates Truth and Good. What is Good is also True and vice versa, and to find Truth (free from contradictions, like those Gorgias made) is the ultimate Good. From the Phaedo: &#34;We shall be pure and converse with other pure souls, and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere; and this is surely the light of truth.&#34; The Republic further expands on the idea that beauty and truth are unified in the Good.<br /><br />And for the record, the Sophists  - the people who Phaedrus claims realized Quality first, the golden Philosophers who existed before the 2,300 years of Socratic poisoning - had some really bogus ideas which actually contradict Phaedrus. If Pirsig had the internet and greater access to information in the 70s when he was writing this book, he would've also seen that Protagorus, whom he quotes, believed there was no universal truth at all - rather, truth differs according to each individual in the &#34;whatever's true for you is true for you, and whatever's true for me is true for me&#34; sort of way. This seems at odds with the absolute Truth of Quality that Pirsig claims they all realized and believed in. Beyond that, Pre-Socratic philosophers believed in absolutely ridiculous things, like Anaximander (admittedly, a cosmologist) who said the earth was surrounded by several rings of fire.<br /><br />I could go on but I think this is a sufficient critique of my perceived misunderstandings about Socrates in the book. One last thing. Socrates' justification for believing what he believed is that nobody could out-argue him without contradicting himself: &#34;I don't claim to know the true nature of these things, but nobody has been able to debate against me and not appear ridiculous&#34; (Gorgias dialogue). But here is how Pirsig supports his ideas: &#34;Anyone who cannot understand this meaning ... is either lying or so out of touch with the common humanity as to be unworthy of receiving any reply whatsoever&#34; (pg. 484). I have to admit, I see more surety and greater Quality in Socrates' approach.standings about Socrates in the book. One last thing.

B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is a great book, and I regularly recommend it to my patients. Dr Perlmutter, as one of the leading integrative neurologists in the world, does an amazing job in pointing out the harmful effects of grains and carbs on brain function. Many people talk about the effect of diet and how it affects our health, but this book clearly outlines the science behind how our diet can cause inflammation in the body, leading to many of the common neurological syndromes we see today. A must read for doctors wanting to educate their patients about diet, and patients concerned about maintaining healthy brain function into their later years.<br />Dr Richard Horowitz
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This surprised me. I didn't have many expectations of it, but it really was a pretty good read. It poses some thought provoking questions and that's what reading is all about, right?  My only problem was keeping all the characters straight, but that's probably only my problem and not everyone else's complaint.

B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|I love reading John Grisham books but this one was a disappointment.  The good things are that it follows up with one of Grisham's prior heros, Jake Brigiance, from a Time to Kill, 3 years after the Carl Hailey trial.  I enjoy Brigiance as a character but the best thing about this book was picturing Matthew McConaughey as I read it since he played Brigiance in the movie version of Time to Kill.  Other than that this story was slow, somewhat boring and had no characters in it you could get really excited about.  I had a hard time sticking with a book, but I did as I kept thinking it would get better.  Once the trial scenes started that helped but not by much.  There were random attorneys thrown in at different points in the book that seemed irrelevant, and being an attorney myself, it strayed too far from reality for me.  The premise was about a will contest which just isn't a sexy enough topic to write a 440 page book about, no matter how much money is at stake.  Better luck next time Mr. Griisham.

There is no way past some of the ads other than clicking on them, which is probably against the advertisers terms. As others have said it also loads video ads.. ridiculous.  This is an awful app that you should NOT download.  There are plenty of solitaire options that aren't so infested.

We have the highest speed for download at our home and WIFI at different locations is great, but when it comes to AMAZON downloading it really is frustrating and an unpleasant experience.

I have tried numbers times to contact Amazon but cannot get in contact with anyone to dispute this matter.

0525478817|1.0|Popwatch is running a contest to determine the best YA novel of all time. 60 novels were chosen for the honor, and after a week of voting it's come down to just two: the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling and The Fault in Our Stars by John Green.<br /><br />I assume everyone reading this is familiar with Harry Potter, but as for TFiOS and John Green, here's a bit of context: John is a part time Youtube celebrity/part time author who has built himself a fiercely loyal fanbase that call themselves `nerdfighters'. They purport to be people who stick up for the little guy, and advertise themselves as people who celebrate and defend all things \\"nerdy\\". It was through their passion and devotion that TFiOS could end up finishing no worse than runner-up when all is said and done.<br /><br />I was only passingly familiar with John Green until recently. I had heard of his work, and many of my friends were devoted readers of his, but I never had an interest in reading any of his work until TFiOS became as big as it is now. While I'm not a huge a fan of the YA genre, I eventually sat down to read it. The plot is basically as follows: 17 year old Hazel Lancaster has cancer and attends a support group for said cancer. She is enchanted by the author of An Imperial Affliction, who has written her favorite book about cancer. At support group she meets a boy named Augustus Waters, whom she becomes smitten with instantly. They fall in love, and, together, attempt to find the author of An Imperial Affliction while dealing with cancer, each other, and the trials and tribulations of being a teenager.<br /><br />The biggest and most noticeable problem is the dialogue. To put it simply, it's laughable:<br /><br />\\"It does not taste like God Himself cooked heaven into a series of five dishes which were then served to you accompanied by several luminous balls of fermented, bubbly plasma while actual and literal flower petals floated down around your canal-side dinner table.\\"<br /><br />\\"Howdid scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivity?\\"<br /><br />These are teenagers. You can tell me they talk like this because they had to grow up faster (as if that's an excuse) until you're blue in the face and I won't buy it. Not with lines like this:<br /><br />\\"There will come a time when all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that's what everyone else does.\\"<br /><br />The whole book is like this. I'll never fault a writer for writing in his natural voice (if that's truly how he speaks), but this is a perfect example of a style that is incompatible with the genre. When you claim to be true to how teenagers think, feel, and talk, and come up with a contrived and pretentious mess, it makes me question how in tune to teenage culture and reality you are. Funnily enough, if this contest was any indication, Green is being touted as the poster child for a writer that \\"gets\\" teenagers. If that's true, teenagers have an awfully generous view of themselves. I don't know a single person, adult or teen, that talks like that, and I'm a teenager myself.<br /><br />But I guess I can't blame him. He panders to his demographic brilliantly. I can only imagine how many young girls read this and wish for their own Augustus Waters. It's base wish fulfillment, and he does it well. It reminds me of another book that's been accused of being wish fulfillment -  Twilight. Both require a shotgun romance in order to work. There is no rhyme, reason, or motivation - the characters get together because the plot demands it. Both have a plot that's subservient to the romance. Both introduce a \\"perfect man\\" into the lives of their teenage girl protagonists. More importantly, both books have `projection characters' - characters with no real personality or motivation - as main characters, so that readers can project themselves into the story in their place.<br /><br />Characterization is creating complex, relatable characters that have real motivations, desires, and faults; in other words, it's making characters that are human. It's making us care about what happens to these characters. When you make them so shallow we have to substitute ourselves into the story, you're avoiding accountablility to your readers, because you're no longer telling a story about characters. You're telling a story about the reader, and who doesn't have an emotional reaction to themselves?<br /><br />What personality does Hazel have? She likes watching TV, she bitches about support group, and she's into having public sex in the Anne Frank house (a thing that actually happens, to cheering and applause. I'm not even s***ting you. At this point, the story becomes so ridiculous it doesn't even merit a serious response). She also, coincidentally, likes to Capitalize Things like This. I counted nearly 100 (yes, one hundred) incidents of this. It's quirky, and quirky sells, I guess, but it's more conveniently a way to disguise immature and underdeveloped writing.<br /><br />Hazel's only role in the story is to provide an outlet for Augustus to wax poetic. To put it bluntly, Augustus is the pseudo-intellectual mouthpiece of John Green. I've never seen a more annoying, self-satisfied character in my life. He talks about the philosophy and justification for running hurdles. He quotes poetry, and he's oh so gorgeous. What's striking, though, is how similar he is to John Green, in his mannerisms, beliefs, and how he presents himself.<br /><br />This is not good character writing. It's narcissistic and self indulgent. I don't care if John Green is the most charitable, giving person on Earth, self inserting yourself as the philosophical hero of your own story is the height of arrogance. That isn't the only incident of narcissism; Hazel is obsessed with an author who wrote a book about cancer...just like John Green. The parents are an idealistic version of his own parenting style. Every character, in some way, shape, or form, is a manifestation of his personality. Because YA as a genre is almost exclusively character driven, when your characters are shallow, unlikable, and you don't know how to write them any other way, your story is doomed.<br /><br />The biggest problems, however, are the liberties John Green takes to make the story work. He has said that he ignores the facts of cancer \\"with a grin\\" in order for the story to read like he wants it to. He has also said that he believes teenagers are smarter than they're given credit for, and that the book was an attempt to capture their true thought process. I agree, but there's a problem: you can't ignore the facts of cancer \\"with a grin\\". You can't possibly say you're trying to write the realistic thought process of teenagers then ignore the reality of what they're going through. It's dishonest and insincere.<br /><br />How does he do that? A combination of poor characterization, ham-fisted dialogue, and a sloppy plotline dependent on the shallow romance of its protagonists. But it's not just bad writing. It's a lot more than that, and the underlying reason why this book made me so angry.<br /><br />When I was younger, my uncle was diagnosed with throat cancer. He took it as seriously as an inmate would take a judge's death sentence. He survived and is now thriving, but he took it seriously because cancer demands respect. We've had remarkable medical advances that have made it not quite the death sentence it once was, but it's still the deadliest thing in existence. So when you have cancer, you are, understandably, afraid for your life. That leads me to this:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />He died weeks later. This is how a brave man reacts to his own mortality. This is also the same attitude that is mocked, openly, shamelessly and repeatedly, throughout the book. Cancer isn't a joke. People die from it, and they're afraid of it. They're afraid for their lives, and from the time they're diagnosed to the time it's in remission or they're dead, they are being affected by it, be it from the chemo keeping them bed-ridden, or from them being so weak from treatment that they don't have the energy to see other people. They don't quote poetry at each other. They don't opine lovingly about the nature of existence. Cancer is not a game, John Green. It's not something you exploit for your own masturbatory fantasies.<br /><br />Funnily enough, while he insists teenagers are smarter than they're given credit for, he insists on explaining the metaphors and philosophical meaning within the book as if they aren't that smart at all. It's not even done well. The best example of this Augustus, placing a cigarette in his lips and refusing to light it. He says this is an example of doing something deadly but not giving it the power to kill you. It's treated as this great philosophical insight, and the story sets this up so that we're supposed to revel in his brilliance.<br /><br />I've heard similar criticisms levied at his other works, so I don't think it's just a one time, bad book thing. This completely put me off his other books. Maybe that's a good thing. I end by saying that the primary problem with TFiOS, John Green, Nerdfighters, and everyone in between is an inability to grow up. I ask John Green to speak for himself, because the fault is in your stars, not ours.

1936891026|4.0|Designed for artists, writers, entrepreneurs trying to connect to their muse, this book provides a good kick in the pants! A bit simplistic and overwrought in places but also full of pithy wisdom. Quick easy read and worth the time.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|It's fun when it works to doesn't work all the time  and if you don't like ads don't get it and I would give it 1out of 10 stars
0316055433|3.0|The story was engaging. However, it should have been about 300 pages shorter. What started as a wonderful treat in terms of detailed descriptions turned into an overabundance of detail, I found myself skimming through. The themes became repetitive with not much movement. This left the actual story line moving slowly through the plodding descriptions of ordinary situations.  I would recommend it with the understanding that it is too long and if you can glance over much of it, you will eventually get to the end.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love it so much worth your money also fun to play with :) very happy also one more thing you can change your character.

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I have seen the show, just like MLP,and I got the application. I loved it the first time I played it. Except you should be able to get Kibble in MUCH greater amounts and MUCH quicker. Another thing is it should not take SOOOOOO long to get to care for your pet. And when you do, it only raises the bar by a smidgen. Why can't you buy Bling with Kibble? I mean, sure use SOME money to buy more Bling, but for a little less, use Kibble. It should have more mini games too. One more thing, It shouldn't have SOOOOOO many products that cost Bling. Gameloft had really good games, but they should take into account these things. Overall,if you want to spend money, go ahead. You can get by without spending any. If you RREEEAAALLLLYYYY like one of the characters, tell yes/no and which one it is in your comments now on Like, truthfully, me: yes I do and it is the gecko;which is the name that starts with a v. Go read the description of names to find out. You should know if seen the show. I will tell you the rest is here:<br /><br />Dog, Zoe<br />Skunk: Pepper<br />Monkey: Minka<br />Panda: Penney Ling<br />Hedgehog: Russel<br />Mongoose: Sunil<br />Gecko: Vinnie<br /><br /> Those are the names. If you RREEEAAALLLLYYYY like any one of these characters, say in your comment. This is because I do,(and I have said),and if you do, it will let other and me that do, will not feel &quot;awkward&quot;. At any rate, GET IT NOW GET IT NOW GET IT NOW GET IT NOW GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00FPH6M82|2.0|Will's worst movie perhaps.  It was predictable, and just not riveting.  The story was quite boring, and the acting was mediocre at best.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It was the cover that got me.  I also heard an interview with the author at some point about how he collected all of the postcards that later became the photographs in this book.  After what seemed like forever, both of those stuck with me so resoundingly that I hunted it down at a better point in my life, and read it within less than a week.<br /><br />The plot summary is one which you can undoubtedly read the description hook for, so I won't reiterate what's already been said, except that you probably won't be disappointed with this if the description sounds like your thing.<br /><br />Really, it has all of the elements of a haunting, darkly-imaginative and fast-paced fantasy.  If your grandfather ever told you scary stories as a child, stories you wondered about the truthfulness of at a less tender age, then read this book.  If you like exploring old, abandoned places and wondering about what might have been, read this book.  And lastly, if you like compelling characters, great atmosphere, and a main character you can feel for, read this book.  Some of the scenes within are written so vividly that I am left remembering them, even weeks after having finished reading.<br /><br />The only caution I would include is that this is listed as a young adult book, but I'm guessing they mean the `older teen' range, because there is quite a bit cursing and some images that younger kids might find a little bit too edgy.  This isn't a children's book, even if it's billed as one.
B008D36INE|2.0|I watched this for Tom Hiddleston, who does a very good job portraying someone I would never, ever want to encounter in real life.  But the real reason I've rated this movie so low is that Rachel Weisz's character, Hester, is a complete idiot who throws her life away on Freddie.  The movie opens with her attempted suicide and tries to explain how she got to that point via flashbacks, but never succeeds in convincing me that what she's done is either intelligent OR passionate (and bearing in mind that Hiddleston plays Freddie, that takes quite a lot of doing, or not-doing, as the case may be).  What the movie fails to show us is how the relationship between the two of them actually disintegrated, or why she should not go back to the much-older husband who obviously loves her; apparently killing herself is preferable to ... it's not clear what, exactly.  Freddie didn't remember her birthday, but went golfing instead.  Well, sounds like a good excuse for suicide to ME... not!<br /><br />Sorry, Tom.  The movie's a mess, it's not your fault, but it's not worth my time.

B00B2DSK06|5.0|This week for family movie night my 9 year old son chose Wreck-It Ralph. I guess I had not paid any attention to the trailer when the movie was release, I had no idea the movie was about video games. Had I known it was about video games I would not have watched it and missed out on a very good movie!<br /> Wreck-It Ralph is about a video game villian who is tired of always being the bad guy. On his mission to become good he travels through other video games trying to win a medal, because only good guys get the medals. Once he gets to Sugar Rush Ralph learns what it truly means to be a good guy by helping an adorable &#34;glitch.&#34; I think the storyline while Ralph is in the Sugar Rush game is very touching, and my 7 year old daughter loved this part of the movie. Ralph learns that it is not always bad to be a bad guy.<br /> Even tho the movie had a predictable ending I do not believe it hurt Wreck-It Ralph at all!!<br />And Yes, I admit it, even though I would not have chosen this movie on my own, I have already watched it more than once- in just the 2 days since we downloaded it from Amazon Prime!!

B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Fun game. My 5 year old and I play together. Takes to long to vet New pets and houses. It's frustrating for my 5 yr old. We do enjoy it. Add us as a friend. Code 967a28
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|I was first introduced to ZAZ on two 9+ hour legs of my British Airways flights to South Asia in the late summer of 2010. On the flight, I kept coming back to her tracks in-between the movies to get my fill. I pretty much listened to her on my entire journey back - doing whatever one does on flights that long.<br /><br />At that time Je Veux had started making the rounds and her video (with Les Passants and a few TV interviews) was on YouTube accessible only in Europe and South Asia at that time).<br /><br />It's hard to place her music genre - perhaps a combination of French Jazz, French Soul and French Pop may describe her first 2 albums - \\"ZAZ\\" and a very different, energetic jazzy \\"Recto Verso\\".<br /><br />Each album has a live version (\\"Recto Verso - Live\\" was just released on Nov 19th). I can't wait to get my CD from Amazon (shameless plug) and listen to it. The ZAZ \\"live\\" CD - \\"Sans tsu tsou\\" is absolutely fantastic. My early favorite from Sans tsu tsou was Je Veux, especially the beginning of the song. On \\"Sans\\" one feels that Zaz and her band are becoming even more comfortable playing and experimenting with the music and sounds as well as being on stage. Zaz does well with the audience, as if she wouldn't, with her personality which transcends her music.<br /><br />In June 2012 while in Paris, while driving around we got to Stade de France. I noticed a few Zaz posters and asked the cab driver about her. He hadn't heard of her by name, but said that she had had a performance the previous week and it had sold out - just like Johnny Halliday did in his day.<br /><br />Beware though, Zaz is an addiction and listening to her has made me want to get back to learning French again - after 45 years!<br /><br />A bientot.<br /><br />PS: I will update this review with CD and track specifics shortly.<br />PPS: Her official website is: [...] - check it out!
B00004WPAE|5.0|The sound is so clear you can actually hear the smallest of instruments being used it sheds a new light on what was ever heard on vinyl (that's why I'm getting it also on vinyl) it's a very impressive upgrade from older remasters or whatever they called it in the 80's it lights up the passion for Beatle music
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|So funny.  This and the Heat are the two movies I have laughed the most to all year.  At the end, like most movies, you get to see the outtakes.  Probably one of the funnest outtakes I have ever seen.  They have a scene where they turn on the radio and the whole family is suppose to sing to it.  As a joke, that they show in the outtakes, they put in the theme to Friends instead of the song that was suppose to play in the movie
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Love the action which goes with the stories of Fast and the Furious, Excitement throughout this fast paced thrills and spills with explosive action that this team has always  given. Now they have to prove that their the best to complete against another group of bad guys and girls of course in cars, oh don't forget the plane silly me, I nearly did.  Now back to the movie never a dull moment with first class suspense hitting the roof, Cast give there best  that is always, story is great and now its international so more adventures down the track coming up. Want more info sorry but that would spoil everything and so I rated this an A grade plus for entertainment that holds you with tension while watching this fantastic movie. So what are you waiting for go for the popcorn retire to the television sit down, up your feet and try to relax with this fabulous movie, you wont be disappointed that's for sure.  Enjoy!
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|i hope these guys never ever ever stop making music. they just plain dominate all who even attempt to make anything remotely like music. even Bach is like &#34;oooh i get it now&#34;.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This game is a good game but all you do is street race but I would give this game 5 stars.
B00FG1Q5J8|3.0|Star Command is the kind of game I have long awaited, but the battles are so slow and sluggish I couldn't play more than two battles. 10 minutes for a -regular- battle is INSANE. Other reviews state it had a rather short storyline ans I'm guessing it was made slow to the game time up.<br /><br />I'd say to save your money until it gets an update to make the battles faster- unless you're into sitting around for long periods of time, doing mostly nothing.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Great game. Great physics. Great cars. Hours of various challenges. Never-ending online play.<br />Got all my friends and family to play too. Even the girls
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|I love this game a ton, it's in depth, tons of stuff and cool features.<br />Badness:<br />The controls are rather junky, but I guess it's the best that could be done in a game ported from the PC.<br />The inventory system sucks too- it word fine at first, now I have to move something to an empty slot and then back again to swap to items!<br />By biggest problem is the lack of hardmode- I spent loads of time building up for hardmode, then I fought WoF and then bam. No hardmode. It was an incredible let down, but hopefully in future versions it will be added.<br /><br />Overall, it's an awesome game and I definitely recommend it, more so when(maybe if) it is updated.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Awesome exept for the fact that you have to pay another 99&cent; to continue on after world 5. Other than that, it's great!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game does not STOP.  Keep trying, you will fail, then try again. Raise or lower, twist to the left or right. Then fail again, THEN it's so obvious, how did I miss it. Serious love hate relationship. I've done three levels and so far it's been a good game!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have an account for this on the computer, and I play this one even more! You might say that's weird, since you have to pay $3 for this, but you can't really go wrong for the price.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Amazing, so much fun.  Can't wait until the updates are available.  It is challenging but it definitely keeps your interest.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Very Nice album! I liked better than the previous album, Its full of dance music, Some songs are crazy and don't have meaning but it's fun.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I like this game but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because I am 10 and I beat all the levels in two days WITHOUT ANY CHEATS and it was EASY TO BEAT!! I was 8 when I beat all the levels and all I have to say is they need to make some I don't know HARDER LEVELS!!!!!
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|A definite must for major rage fans. You got two cd's and two dvd's including all the music video's! It also comes with a booklet, a thank you card, and a double sided poster, and the album on vynle. When mine came in the mail, I FREAKED! I watched both dvd's right away and fell in love with this album all over again. Kinda spendy but well worth it in my eyes. Love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush &amp; its lowkey addictive :)<br />I play all the time I even did q current event n my JROTC class about why its so addictive and I received an A .
B005PK56TA|5.0|It kept me guessing until the very end what would happen to these people.I love it and would watch it again.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was a good story to read about 2 people falling in love, but the writer needs some work.  I had to skip over some pages because she was saying the same thing over and over again.  I didn't read book 3.  I don't think I would have been able to finish it.  I liked the ending of book 2 and don't want to know any more.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Second books in a trilogy are tricky.  They have to keep the momentum of the first book going, keep the reader’s interest, but do so without resolving too much.  CATCHING FIRE fortunately does the trick very well.  In fact, it is to this book’s credit that the actual games in this book, in which past victors have to battle to the death, are the least interesting part of it.<br /><br />Much better are the first two-thirds of this book, with Katniss Everdeen uncomfortably filling her role as the winner of the previous Hunger Games, angering the all-powerful and totalitarian Capitol in doing so.  Ironically, having won the Games has actually endangered her and her loved ones more, the opposite effect of traditional winners, in which triumph means some easing of the Capitol’s oppression.  Katniss’ maneuvering to protect those around her makes for some good reading, providing as it does an portrait of life in the horrible outer districts.<br /><br />I doubt that I am giving anything away when I mention that there are hints and small pieces of evidence that pop up suggesting rebellions in the districts.  Katniss, in large part responsible for these as a symbol of defiance against the Capitol, tries to gain as much information as she can while trying to downplay her personal role in the situation.  The tension this creates is as interesting as the action scenes.<br /><br />Ok, being a young adult novel, there are passages regarding Katniss’ relationships with others, especially the young men Peeta and Gale, that are a tad painful for an adult reader.  But so what?  Adults are not the target audience for these books.  Teens are.  And teens would likely better connect with these portrayals.  In all, catching fire is a worthwhile continuation of the series and I look forward to the third book with interest.

B005PK56TA|4.0|Weird but strange - which is i'm sure it was meant to be. I was only left with two questions at the end. First : What truly was Thaddeaus's story (the child creature with the teeth & claws)? and Second : If most of the ghosts in the house were benevolent to begin with, why did they wait until the last family moved in before doing something about keeping from buying the house in the first place. Oh, and one more question - Why doesn't the realtor just take a loss on the property and leave the place abandoned?
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I spent two days trying to get this thing to work. 90 percent of the time the apps didn't even pick up its signal. I checked my wifi signal, I unplugged everything. My final conclusion is that this thing is a giant piece of crap.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|This is just a fun movie - The actresses and actors are all just so good in their roles. The story is cute and funny without being too stupid to rewatch each year. But I will share that while I did love the song that Bette Midler sings during the adult Halloween dance - are you guys as tired as me of having a song solo put into a movie just because the have a famous singer as one of the characters? But my personal opinion aside about that - I love this movie and watch it every year at Halloween.
B008PU8SR4|5.0|This is an excellent novel about a young boy with Aspergers Syndrome and should be compulsory reading in high schools.  I found it so realistic, having worked with a young man with this condition.  Mark has really shown how the world of an Aspergers sufferer thinks and acts.  Well done Mark.
B00CFA227C|4.0|I thought the twist on this story made for a fun movie.  I bought the Blue Ray version and the graphics are great.  Even though it was largely panned when it came out this movie is worth a look.  It's not in the league with all the Super Hero movies that have been releases but still IMHOP it was better than many negative reviews made it appear and was definitely better than I expected.  There was a descent story, lots of action. and a couple of twists that made for a good time.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|I like it a lot and its very fun. I would p play it all the time. I do when I have the chance.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I THOUGHT THIS APP HAD TO BE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, ESPECIALLY being free and all. BUT WOW MY HUSBAND AND I USE THIS EVERY NIGHT.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game and play it daily on my iPhone and iPad.  It is easy to use and easy to understand.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|An entertaining game. It is fun to play. I like that you do not have to have energy points to play.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Lots of fun to play I just wish I could get more tokens without paying for them or waiting to scratch cards
B005COO1X6|5.0|This was a great thriller, wish it would have been longer.  Almost reminds me of Christine, but with a twist.
B00F6JKT7O|4.0|It's CARCASS.  A bit of a mix between &#34;Tools Of The Trade&#34; and &#34;Heartwork&#34;.  Nice solos.  If you're a Carcass fan... you will like it.  Not a bad return for these fellas.  See what you think.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't think there was a part I hated. Suzanne Collins made you feel attached to the characters. I cried at least 5 times throughout the whole book, and I can usually hold myself from crying. I just watched the 2nd movie and thought I should read the book again. The author gives you so many details, I feel like I have watched a third movie. I love this whole series. I'm usually not drawn to series because I usually do not see the point, but I am so glad there is three books. She ends it very well, leaving bother behind. She makes you feel at peace with everything and not ponder about what happens next, after the third book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to operate and simple. I do also like the point system and the chances to win things. The layout is easy to understand and operate.
1619691825|4.0|Interesting story and an easy listen.  Good author and story line.  Like this type of story.  Narrator has a clear voice.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I thought this was a excellent strategy war game. The online addition to the game was good also. In this game you can rank up and increase your glory rating. The glory rating system in the game allows you to enter contests and at the end of every week you get medals. The campaign in the game is slow. The reason for that is because you need to have oil drums to do them. When you get online you can have factions. Factions are groups of people joined together, like a clan almost. However there is also a system in the game that you can add other people in the online world as your friends. The friend system allows you to send out a distress call for help in battle in you are losing. In order to gain hearts you need to go to there base every 24 hours and put out fires. This game comes complete with air, ground, and underwater modes. Overall this is an excellent game to buy and I think you should. Good luck out there.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love Diamond Dash! It's fun and fast paced. Recommended for a great way to relax and keep your motor skills in tune.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I have ever gotten. But when is the 0.8.0 update coming out. I'm going to be really exited when the update comes out.
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend so she can finally participate in the minor nerf battles that break out. She loves it. She can not stop gloating about how she has a better &#34;cocker&#34; then my Strongarm. She says it is easy to use, effective and quite powerful. She has now developed a game where every-time I annoy her, she puts a dart in the gun and spins it &#34;Russian roulette style&#34;. She then fires at my face, if she hit the game resets, if not I get a pass, but the dart stays in the chamber. This means eventual I get shot in the face, Great fun! Since my purchase she has gone ahead and ordered the 75 pack of blue elite darts. She likes the new &#34;rebelle&#34; darts, but she said and I quote &#34;that is way too expensive for foam darts, I can get 75 for the price of 12 of the fancy pants darts&#34;.<br /><br />The holster is great. It works on any type of pants, even the elastic sweat pants ot yoga pants women are so fond of. The glasses are gimmicky, but basically free.

After seeing it was available this morning I told my kids they could watch it tonight and they were very excited and looking forward to it. I've always felt Amazon was good to deal with but this is rotten of them to list one price and then more than double it later in the same day.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This is one of the best rpgs I have ever played on a mobile device! It has a the choice of third and 1st person view, the shops have awesome equipment, the fighting is outstanding compared to most rpgs and the enemy's are actually challenging. Also the skill tree is pretty cool.<br /><br />Flaw fixes:<br /> The screen positioning Is reversed for kindle fire, but can easily be fixed just by laying it flat. The enemy's might be overly challenging for some people, but there is a difficulty bar in the options menu if you want to fix that; or you could just level up your character until it's easier. There is hunger in the game, but food is very easy to get all you need to do is buy it at a shop or kill creatures and search them. If your game glitches out or won't past a certain point just delete a bunch of unwanted apps and it'll play just fine.

B00DXP7L88|4.0|I bought Season 8 and was ready to be disappointed....not true.  Before I bought the series, I had it in my head that Dexter must have been caught....why would everyone hate the final season so much?  I mean, isn't he the serial killer we all love and understand?  His thoughts are the exact thoughts we think but don't say and his not understanding muchof the \\"big deal\\" of simple human nature makes him endearing.<br /><br />I didn't want him to get caught.....  I even thought someone slipped and told me that he was caught.  You can imagine my surprise when he didn't get caught.  I was excited at first, but the more I watched of the finale....the more uneasy I felt.  This is what the writers wanted us to feel.  There is an uneasiness in rooting for the bad/good guy isn't there?  I think so many people didn't like the ending is because ....and I'm not sure if they want to admit it....they related to Dexter.  He was intelligent, felt out of place in most social situations, wanted to fit it but didn't know how....we all have a dark something in our personalities.  It may not be serial killer dark....but we all have it.  The ending made us relate too much to what could happen to us if we let that dark something in our personality go too far.  I don't mean serial killing, but in the sense of not relating, hurting others and feeding into the darkness of our own  personality (jealousy, greed, envy).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the final season....until the final scene!  They went one scene too many...It made me feel like they took this wonderful character and just made him creepy rather than the intelligent, struggling being that he was through all the seasons.  I liked the Dr. Vogle character- the psychology of it all.  I liked that Dexter's trauma was being healed and it was questionable whether Dexter was truly a psychopath or if he had PTSD exacerbated by the good Dr. and his father.  I even liked Hannah who mirrored Dexter's own trauma history<br /><br />Buy this if youhaven't....you'll like it....if you can examine inside yourself what it really is that you don't like about the ending.  I think people related to Dexter so closely that the ending reflected something inside of themselves that made them feel a little too uneasy.  Just my own thoughts....I had to really reflect after that final scene....will truly miss Dexter!
1476727651|2.0|My review of Doctor Sleep: Zzzzzzzzz.<br /><br />Boring and predictable. Learned more about AA than anything else. Great premise, lame execution.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Is This a Good Book for Kids?<br /><br />As a media professor and author of young adult sci-fi, I have spent more than a few years studying research on entertainment and psychology.  Just before Catching Fire was released in theaters, I was asked this question by a television news program.<br />Most of the research that exists on the impact of media violence on children concerns television and video games.  However, a common theme in all the research was that exposure to violence with no social justice creates feelings of helplessness and inevitability.<br /><br />This is particularly significant when looking at the influence of peer groups.  Peer group establish norms for behavior.  Younger people are more susceptible to following the norms established by their peer group, even when that behavior is destructive.  We see bullying as a prevalent example.<br /><br />Kids who have developed a strong a sense of social justice—the belief that their actions matter to society, are able to identify and withstand the negative tendencies of their peer group.  They may deal with it differently.  One individual may loudly challenge the behavior, while another may find more subtle means to counteract the group’s destructive behavior.<br /><br />So when we put the violence of “The Hunger Games” into the context of the entire story, the question becomes, “What values does the book impart?  Particularly, the narrator, Katniss?”  She is a teen from a poor community, oppressed by those in power.  She sacrifices herself for a greater cause, in this case initially to save her younger sister from certain death.  Finally she decided she would rather die than accept the ruling-class’s inhumane system of social control.  When she is forced to fight, she only defends herself and risks her life to defend others who are weaker or disadvantaged.  By standing up to unjust authorities, she changes the world for the better. These are values we hope to find in people of all ages.<br /><br />The book’s message of resistance to oppression seems to me to be an antidote to oppression felt by both kids and adults.<br />To find much of the research concerning children and media entertainment, do a search on Joanne Cantor (University of Wisconsin) and Patti Valkenburg (University of Amsterdam), leading scientists in this field./><br />The book’s message of resistance to oppression seems to me to be an antidote to oppression felt by both kids and adults.<br />To find much of the research concerning children and media entertainment, do a search on Joanne Cantor (University of Wisconsin) and Patti Valkenburg (University of Amsterdam), leading scientists in this field.

B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|„Rabbit-Proof Fence“ is a film based on a real story that happened in the 20th century. It is about the three Aboriginal children Molly, Gracie and Daisy who were caught by the authorities and put in home for Aboriginal children called Moore River. They were separated from their families because the white people wanted to annihilate the Aborigine people by “breeding out the colour” of the Aboriginal children. They are called the “stolen generation”.<br />When the three kids arrive at Moore River, they want to go back home. One morning their escape succeeds and the hunt begins. Will they get back home? The adventure becomes a fight for their survival.<br />We really liked this film because it has very emotional and sad parts. The three children win your heart quickly during the film and their story is very hard.<br />The film is starring people we didn’t know. The kids do a very good job at their parts and they give them much personality. The actors really fit in their roles. The film is a real story so it’s a bit more emotional. The soundtrack sometimes conveys a dangerous atmosphere. We’ve got a really good opinion about the film but some parts are a bit boring.<br />We highly recommend this film on a scale from one to then with an eight because some parts brought tears to our eyes.<br />Overall grade  B<br />story  A+<br />acting  A<br />direction  B

B0087JTAKW|5.0|So good.  Like his others a moral to the story,  a little about death .  And a lot about life.
B007SGM084|5.0|Was very entertaining and liked that it was a series.Hope the movie sticks close sticks close to the storyline.Thanks was a good read.
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|It's a heavy game.  It's a typical Feld game because there are a ton of ways to make points, but the different ways to make points are a bit overwhelming a first.  Each element is not that difficult in itself, it's determining how to make it all work for you that is most difficult.  A great game that my wife and I love playing as a two-player game.
B008602KQI|4.0|It was good, but I guess I was expecting more after having heard all the hype when it came out.
0307236722|5.0|After I bought Martha Stewarts cooking school book, I liked it so much I bought another as a gift for my daughter and my two granddaughters; both of whom are getting old enough to learn how to cook and Martha Stewart is the one best equipped to do so.  Then this book came along and it going to my daughter also because she loves to bake but is dieting so she takes her creations in to feed to the doctors she works with that are the most deserving (those that don’t scream and throw instruments about the room during a procedure).  She’s getting for Christmas, so I hope she doesn’t run across this review.  Another beautiful book by Martha Stewart, whose Polish background brings to us most of the classical recipes enjoyed by most Europeans, past and present.  When it comes to cooking, Europe is a small community.
B000H305U0|5.0|lovesounds is a great cd we rock out to JT every day in the car.. I'm bringin sexy back is a hoot.. LOVE IT
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I love this game case. I am often on the road or displaced from my regular gaming environment and this case has been perfect for on the go gaming. The only issue I have had was the monitor seemed to still be dark on the brightest settings. I found this to be just an issue with the view in angle when the case is fully open. So I just put something under the back of it to prop it up a little and this def helped. Highly recommended!
B00005RFAI|5.0|we love PINK.. so what's to say... she is a hardcore rocker chic and we love all her stuff  it's all good
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game very addictive. I like it. Only drawback is no rewards for longer shots. Graphics are good. Levels can be repetitive.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book is immediately different because it has you shifting from Tris' point of view to Tobias' point of view. There were several times I had to look back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose mind I was reading from. Definitely would've chosen a different ending, but such is life. Glad to see all the loose ends wrapped up.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I loved this device when it arrived. I plugged it in and played tunes from Google Play to my TV, This is the reason I purchased it.<br />I recommended it to others, clever cheap device.  Life was good BUT then the Netgear wireless router died.<br /><br />Comcast provided me with a replaement Technicolor (how's that for a name?) modem/router/phone combo which worked with some but not all of my wireless devices. I spent my free time fiddling with DMZ and UPN settings to get a few more device online with mixed success. The Chomecast player was not going to work.<br /><br />I decided to go it alone with my own equipment. I purchased a Motorola Surfboard SB6141 modem (Comcast approved) and a TP-LINK TL-4300 dual band wireless router. The Roku 3 is working on 5Ghz, the wireless printer is online, Netlix is streaming from the TV, Amazon Prime works..... everything works except this.......<br /><br />If you want to get it I suggest you Google Chromecast and {insert your router model here} for compatibility.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|So we'll written.<br />The only thing is that they are short stories , and one tends to mix the characters. Nevertheless , a great enjoyable read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the only game I make time to play in my spare time... which is few and far between.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|the lovely bones is a good book to read with murder and a hint of ghost i rate this book 10 out 10
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Not only does the text go by far too fast but having real life people cut and pasted into a scene just looks trashy and is the main reason I would not recommend it at all. It looks like garbage.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An outstanding work again by John Grisham.  Keeps you hooked into the story while providing great character and site development.  Also interestingly details racism that is still alive in the deep south.  A fantastic read!
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Day of the Doctor is absolutely fantastic. A bit slow at first but the moment David Tennant comes on screen, You will flip out...in a good way mind you. Matt Smith is good as always and works great with David and John Hurt really ties it all together and is fantastic as War Doctor, I hope we see more of him in the future.<br /><br />I love the nod to Tom Baker, the 4th Doctor, at the end of the special and I love how Peter Capaldi, the 12th Doctor, appears during a sequence with every other doctor during the big scene near the end of the special. It makes me far more excited to see him as the doctor.<br /><br />Overall, Without a doubt it's a great special and well worth buying. I just wish Eccleston would have taken the time to film at least one scene for it because it not only would have made it that much more better but it would have been a real treat to the fans.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So far this game is good. I played a lot on Facebook, and I am hoping this version lives up to or surpasses the original.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great and fun for children and challenging when you get to higher levels. This is a great app which improves after every update! Highly recommend for other children. I'm fourteen and absolutely love it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book should have been called, &#34;When bad things happen to horrible demons&#34;. It was so nice to revisit a beloved character and the continuing story was wonderful. I loved it, great read!
B000V6U846|5.0|it brings memories back and makes you just happy...you want to dance the whole time...great quality...this album was always my favorite and it will be always....
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I only started to read because of the movie. Loved the book the only thing i regret is watching the movie before reading the book. Started catching fire and will finish it before watching the movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like accuweather  because it gives me an up to the minute report with lots of information  and data.  I am an avid user.
B008JFUORW|5.0|The Hangover Part III is still a very funny movie and yet with a very happy ending I am so proud of it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I've wanted to read this since it came out.  My dad read it and said it was good.  So I gave it a try.  I don't usually read books about war or military subjects.  This was a great surprise and explanatory to someone not used to the terminology.  I enjoyed the details and accounts of what happened.  It's amazing how someone can be tracked for years before being brought to justice.  Congrats to the authors for bringing the truth to the world.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I think that this version is better than the previous version of Castleville. However, there is a very heavy emphasis on Crown usage, so be prepared to wait a lot, or spend real money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it!  Amazing story that you can get lost in.  I'm so glad I read it and I look forward to seeing the movies!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is a fun read. Not as terrifying as the Shining and not a sequel per se, but a solidly written Stephen King novel. The story has some entertaining twists, a moral or two, and offers brilliant images/sounds/smells that Stephen King is so expert at writing. I recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game needs another update so it is more fun. I like the game but it really needs another update.
B00FRMCYQ4|4.0|I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this movie coming out, but as I watched the trailers and previews about it, I decided I'd give it a shot... turns out it's a great movie. Yes it's about a racing snail, but it's about perseverance and going for your dreams no matter what.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very good read extremely sexual but with a very good back story<br />Probably shouldn't be read by children but if your looking for good sex ideas definitely read it
B009WUAK2M|1.0|The Expendables 2 is just a long long sequence of campy blood and guts that just gets boring. Don't waste your time!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book drew me in quickly and left me intrigued and going back for more.  Imagine finding a letter that was never meant to be found, a letter to be opened only at the time of your spouse's death.  What if that letter changed everything you knew to be true?  Would you keep the secret or let it out?  Liane Moriarty does an excellent job of taking the reader through a roller coaster of emotions with excellent character development and description.  There is plenty to discuss with a group or contemplate on your own regarding conscience, ethics, choices.  I would highly recommend this novel.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|new...as advertised. Shipped promptly. Would buy from this seller again. Great experience with this seller. I have always experienced great service from Amazon, and I will continue to make purchases there in the future.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I was so sorry to finish this book because it meant I just read the sixth book Joe wrote, and now I had to find someone else to read. I have to put Joe up on a level field with some of my favorite authors. I can't wait for his next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Luv this game!This game is so very Cool.  Everybody should play this game.  It is awesome!<br />I like to pretend I'm him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. Its fun how u can save up and by some of the characters. U use your fingers unlike Temple Run where u tilt your kindle. Its so much better than temple run
0399161287|5.0|&#34;Undisputed Truth&#34; is one of the most honest, insightful and soul baring books I've ever ready - by anyone.<br /><br />As a long time Mike Tyson fan (and someone who used to be terrified of him as a kid), I can honestly say that not only is this one of the best sports related biographies I've ever read, it's one of the best books I've read in a very long time. Mike is open, revealing, straight-to-the-point, and actually quite funny. He recounts his highest highs (becoming the youngest heavyweight champion in history), and his lowest lows (the loss of mentor Cus D'Amato and his loss to Buster Douglas), in a brutally honest fashion that makes you want to go back and re-watch some of his older interviews, to see if you still believe him to be the &#34;savage&#34; he portrayed himself to be during his historic reign.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of Mike Tyson the boxer. This book, and the recent TV show &#34;Being Mike Tyson&#34; has made me an even bigger fan of Mike Tyson the man. I don't know Mike, I've never met him, but I can honestly say that I'm proud of him.<br /><br />Way to go champ!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|If you don't care about the PvP. You can play it as an open map hack and slash. Coop feature is pretty cool. You can advance without cash but the game like many others is designed to get money from you. I hope gameloft can One day trust their obvious development talents and stop producing games that are just clever slot machines.<br />  That said it is well above the standard money sucking rpg. Enjoy folks. Just don't get $1 and $5 to death. If you have the money buy yourself a champion.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Great all around effort on the most recent album from AB.  Once again in love.  Myles, Mark, Scott, and Brian won't let you down if you're looking to rock!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|After the somewhat-surprising success of &#34;Downton Abbey's&#34; first season (at least in the US), the second year was highly anticipated worldwide. The delicate balance between the aristocratic family living at the Yorkshire estate and the family's servants was sure to come under fire in the light of changing world events, and with so much more at stake, this year was bound to be exciting.<br /><br />When we left season one, the first World War had just broken out. Season two picks up two years later, with the family's heir, Matthew Crawley, firmly in the middle of the Battle of the Somme. As Cousin Matthew is fighting in the trenches, the rest of the family (and most of the staff) are at home in England, trying to do their bit for the war effort, and, as the war continues to drag on, making some bold choices to help those in need. Though it's being fought hundreds of miles away, the war does not leave England untouched, and Downton Abbey is not left out of the fray.<br /><br />With World War I providing a dramatic background of the lives of the family and servants we have come to love, there were changes that had to be made in season two. While the first year was idyllic in how it looked at Edwardian times, that way of life has vanished and seems unlikely to return. The era of great houses may be coming to an end, and the world itself is being thrown into the future in a rather violent manner. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the daughters of the family - Ladies Mary, Edith and Sybil - adapt the quickest to this brave and modern world. Even Cora is eager to pitch in and become somewhat of a working woman, leaving the Earl himself at loose ends as to how he fits into this strange new world.<br /><br />Where the last season was about meeting the characters and coming to grips with their personal situations, this year is about change. The War has changed the world, and everyone on the estate - from the Earl himself to the kitchen maid - must change with it. We see as Downton opens its doors to convalescing officers, Sybil takes up nursing and learns of a potential suitor (who isn't quite suitable for the family), and Edith learns to drive. Downstairs, Carson must deal with an increasing shortage of staff, Mrs. Hughes finds herself mixed up in a housemaid's complicated love life, and William wants nothing more than to go to the front to fight for his country.<br /><br />Of course, there are many new characters introduced this year, from the delicate Lavinia Swire to the hard-nosed entrepreneur Richard Carlisle. There are new servants, new love interests, and new challenges. But with those around them dying, the house must grab onto happiness when it comes and brave the storm together.<br /><br />Yes, these are the episodes as they originally aired in the UK (without PBS's jarring cuts or few extra scenes), and there are several interesting featurettes, including love in the time of war, costuming, and a behind-the-scenes look at filming. Unlike the UK version of the DVDs, this features no deleted scenes or episode commentary, but otherwise, the two are alike in every way.<br /><br />Many fans have been critical of season two for some of its inconsistencies. Personally, I've always been a fan of the Great War period, so it is fascinating for me. Granted, there are some promising storylines that fail to go anywhere, and some threads don't quite fit in with the characters they're attached to. However, overall, I truly enjoy re-watching this season about as much as I love season one, and that's saying something.
B000002MY3|5.0|This is quite possibly the best album of the 1990s. I know that might not mean a lot to everyone, but this really came out in a special time in music. Coupled with Counting Crows, this was a special time in music history when lyrics transended generations and vocals were so vivid and harsh and beautiful, they continue to haunt me to this day!<br />If you were living under a rock in Bangladesh, and haven't heard this album from start to finish a hundred times, waste no more time. Buy it now!<br /><br />p.s. Ironic isn't the only good song. The bonus track on the last song is amazeballs.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Il Volo's voices are magnificent.  If you buy this CD you will not be disappointed.  Their voices will take you to a place you have never gone before.  Their voices soar.  If you never saw their faces and only heard their voices you would think they were grown men instead of singers in their late teens.  I have all their CDs and love them all.  I have heard and seen them on TV  --  Channel 13 NYC.  Never miss seeing and hearing them.  This will be your favorite Christmas CD.
B005D6442G|5.0|Words can't describe how dreadfully brilliant this series is. You know the writing has to be good, if all of America grows to love a serial killer! I root for Dexter without shame. This show makes you see the world for what it is, a harsh reality of grey. No more black and white lenses, you too will question your humanity and value system as you begin to think about the greater good, as well as the danger lurking next door. The show is a little morbid and has the right amount of gore, but you will be desensitized lickity-split. Dexter is the bomb.com. Trust me.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I'm glad I read this.  The Disney movie version is all song and dance, but this actually explains a LOT of things.  It's not all singing and dancing.  There's a real story behind the movie.  Don't wanna be a buzz kill so I'll just stop.  Just read it.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|Most people have very strong feelings about this season of Lost.<br />I have to say, on one hand, I'm like , &#34;Meh.&#34; because the story is so outrageously unbelievable by this point, it's hard to take it seriously. On the other hand, I'm like, &#34;This ending was perfect...confusing, but perfect.&#34; It takes a little bit of thought, but the message is very clear and it ends the way it's supposed to. All is right, if you will.<br />Side note: The couple than play Jin and Sun Kwon are my favorite on the show. I love them!! I want to marry Jin, and I want to be BFF with Sun. Their story is the most interesting, by far, even though the show goes to great lengths to make everybody else more sexy (unlucky lottery winning millionaire, spinal surgeon, druggie boy band member, outlaw on the run,con artist, pyschic/deadpeoplewhisperer, and so on.) The love story between Jin and Sun is about the only believable aspect of the entire series, and for that reason, it resonates with the audience. Can't get enough!<br />Sun is now on Mistresses on ABC (by far the most interesting character on that show too!).<br />I wonder what ever happened to Jin? If you're reading this Jin, I love you. Marry me!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Even if you saw the movie, like they say, the book is always better.  But in this case, both the book and the movie are just wonderful.  But if I had to pick one over the other, I'd pick the movie.  But still, read this version.  It's very very good.
B005XN31LY|3.0|I am having a hard time deciding whether or not I think the show is okay, vs. I don't like it at all.<br />Here's why: the premise is so intriguing, you have to give it a try.<br />The story line is so conviluted, I don't have the patients to sit and watch beyond the first season. It's stupid. It's confusing. The acting is terrible. Ginnifer Goodwin was beyond fantastic in HBO's Big Love. Here, however, she plays snow white, but has ugly short hair, and a daughter than looks the same age. The liberties they took with the traditional stories ruin everything. Belle is Austrailian, for example. Why the heck would you make a romantic french maiden Australian?? Nothing against the actress who plays Belle though... she's great, especially in LOST.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|They sound just like a kick bleep group called Nickelback.  If you love Nickelback, you're definitely gonna like Theory of a Dead Man.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got this app for my son.  We both play it.  I think I may play more than he does.  It is very addictive.  The only down side is how hard it is to obtain tokens without purchasing them.  But still, an entertaining game I highly recommend.
B0006419J6|5.0|I love Sci-Fi!  Just love it!  This is going to be one of those timeless sci-fi classics.  The graphics are awesome!
0956721591|4.0|The layout of the bilingual texts is ingenious and is clearly the result of careful thought. A glossary with list of difficult words for review at the end of the chapter would have been nice.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This has got to be one of the great novels.  It was spellbinding from the first, and it was a roller coaster ride of emotions.  It was a fun and great read!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I don't know why so many people are down on this book. For me it really took the story where it was bound to go, and was not cheapened by forcing a happily ever after ending. It went where the characters choices would have led them. If you think you can do better then shut up and write your own novels
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This was a really cute book.  It's not an exact replica of the movie which makes it unique in its own right.  Was a very good read.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is still a fabulous reality check on how and where we get our food, and how fowl the Monsanto Empire is; how its political ties negatively impact the world, and the people in it. Everyone should educate themselves by watching this very powerful documentary. It's very important to the health and well being of our families and loved ones.
1451627289|5.0|It's Stephen King!  This is a really strange book.  I love it when King does the time travelling thing, but this is a time travelling story you wouldn't believe!  What if you could change something bad in the past? Would you even try?
1936608898|5.0|I knew the basic information about the Whole30 program to reset one's eating habits with the goal of improved health was available for free on line, but I wanted to know more than what was available on line. I was not at all disappointed. This book is easy to read and to understand and provided a clear rationale for eating &#34;clean.&#34;<br /><br />I found the basic premise of the book to be both simple and compelling: &#34;Food either makes you more healthy or it makes you less healthy.&#34; The book lays out the basic eating template and explains the science behind the recommendations. In addition, the reader is encouraged to make the experience a personal experiment as the foods avoided for the duration of the Whole30 (30 days of strict paleo eating) are carefully added back in and the effects carefully observed. I learned that I have a sensitivity to dairy that I never knew I had. I have no difficulty digesting it, but it causes increased inflammation in my body. This will not be the case for everyone, which is the reason why the Whole 9 team encourages Whole30 participants to do these reintroductions. Once you know the effects different foods have on your body, you can make intelligent decisions about what role those foods will play in your life.<br /><br />I will say that I do have a need to lose weight and the authors are quite careful to point out that the Whole30 is not a weight loss plan, but I did lose about 30 pounds in about 6 weeks, lost a full clothing size, and found my joint pain virtually ended and my energy levels higher than they had been for years. Quite frankly, I felt like I had become ten years younger. It seemed like a miracle, but it was really the amazing effect of eating high quality meat and fish, healthy fats and lots of vegetables in a wide variety, plus a bit of fruit.
B008476HBM|5.0|I've never read this woman before, but I love her writing style and I loved this book!  It was some amazing I couldn't put it down!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is such a great book! If you've had a 'hunch' that you can create your own reality, this book will help you validate it! Not every experiment worked for me, but those that did were surprising! And I do intend to try them all again! I also found myself laughing out loud because it was really an entertaining read! I loved it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King of course!  I LOVE all of Stephen King's books!  ALL OF THEM!  This one was just as awesome as any of his other stories!  I wish there was some way to cyborg him so he would stop aging!  He is my favorite author, and I can hardly stand waiting for his next book!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Such an empowering book from a man with more insight then most. I will read this book every year from here on out.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|That'll teach me to watch the movie first.  The book is a lot different than the movie.  If I had never seen the movie, this book would've ruled!  But even after seeing the movie, this book was still great.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I'm always surprised how much I enjoy author Janet Evanovich, but then again, I wouldn't expect anything less!! I can't get enough.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Good game! Been playing it every another day. Very colorful and cute. Hope they will make it Bubble Blaze 2.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Well written, great character development, but I'm not as crazy in love with this book as others are. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of the genre.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|This is one of the most gripping and suspenseful movies I've ever seen.  Oh my god, it made me afraid to ever leave the USA!  LOL
0061950726|5.0|Held my interest. I had to read it all the way through. I think it would be a great book for book discussion groups.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Almost like being at the show!  Great sound, great video, awesome band!
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|Awesome Movie.... can't go wrong with a Bruce Willis Die Hard movie! Its nice that they are keeping up with new die hard movies.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Much like farmville, but more mystical. Lots of characters with different capabilities. Would nice if you could actually see the adventures they go on...but it's still fun.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|This compilation is like crack for Fleetwood Mac lovers. You'll keep coming back for more. I especially love the last CD with outtakes and recordings of FM in songwriting mode. How Christine's song-in-the making became The Chain was the ultimate highlight for me.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Worst movie EVER. Complete rubbish. One dimensional characters. Poorly written. Even the CGI was awful. Don't waste your time on this one. At least Ed Wood films were good for a laugh. This just sucks.
B00095NX9G|5.0|This DVD not only covers technique but also helps you build the stregth from the ground up to be able to properly do the technique.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Love the movie but it's on Netflix already so there is really no reason to buy it if you have a subscription.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow so awesome except the long waits for updates to get up dates use [...] try this this is so much better just search mcpe and the version.<br />Thx for reading. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun and addicting game great for all ages both young and old keep coming back to it as new lives accumulate
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Awesome I love this book and everything about it the movie is also spectacular thanks for making a wonderful book
B0091REZMW|3.0|sick and tired of it crashing and the horrible customer service.  game itself is very fun but it continuously tells you tonupdate and won't allow you too.  game crashes multiple times during each play.  even though programmer tells you that you can you LOOSE ALL PROGRESS if your kindle breaks and you get a new one and no one seems to care.  have had to start over from the beginning 3 times so far.  it is really a shame as the game itself is fun.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was not to hard or to easy. Look forward to more levels to keep me busy. Thanks for the challenge.
B0098460O4|5.0|Wow, this is a great CD. These two will never cease to amaze. They sing so well together. I don't really like Opera, but that does not stop me from loving these two. Charlotte and Jonathan was their original order of billing and I think both sing equally well. Two great performers!
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Even though Oliver Stone's JFK contains story senarios stretching the truth and characterizations of some individuals that are not supported by any evidence, the core elements and theory's concerning the assassination are contained( though confusingly mixed) in the film. The most important factual information presented in JFK was the unedited Zapruder film.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was slow at the start. Once I figured out the host of characters, I couldn't put the book down. It  is amazing  the secrets in families. So much better to be upfront in the beginning.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|Attempting to adapt a literary classic like F. Scott Fitzgerald's &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; to the screen is always a tricky proposition. Just ask the makers of the 1974 version who got their rear ends handed to them for their efforts - by both critics and audiences alike. The risk, of course, is that devotees of the work will balk at any attempt to expand or modernize it beyond what is contained on the printed page. After all, great works of literature exist primarily in the individual's imagination, and the way one reader envisions a particular scene or character is likely NOT how another reader - or filmmaker - sees them. The result is that literary adaptations all too often turn into stuffy affairs, with movie makers taking the safest possible approach to the material in an attempt not to offend anyone while still trying to make the piece work in an entirely different medium.<br /><br />  All of this is prelude to saying that when it comes to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of &#34;The Great Gatsby,&#34; regardless of how one feels about the final product, one has to at least admire the chutzpah of the effort. (His trumped-up modernized version of &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; similarly divided audiences in the 1990s).<br /><br />  A high school English class staple if ever there was one, the highly prescient &#34;Gatsby,&#34; published in 1925, is often considered to be THE archetypal novel of the Roaring '20s, focused on the party-like decadence, conspicuous consumption and spiritual emptiness of a decade sandwiched between a Great War on one end and a Great Depression on the other. At the center of the piece stands Jay Gatsby himself, the self-made millionaire who achieves the American Dream through a combination of dreamy-eyed determination and corrupt opportunism (with much of his wealth gleaned through bootlegging and gangsterism). Yet, for all the wealth and material possessions he's managed to accrue for himself, Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio) can never find true happiness until he re-connects with the girl of his dreams, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), an alluring Southern-belle he fell in love with while still a penniless officer in the army. In the five years since their last encounter, Daisy, who is willing to go a certain distance with a fantasy romance until the going gets too tough for her, has gone on to marry the brutish womanizer Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby, in that same period, has bought a mansion across the bay from Daisy's house, hoping against hope that she will one day wander into one of his parties and that they will be able to rekindle their love as if nothing had happened in the interim. It is to this end that he befriends his next door neighbor, Nick Carraway Tobey Maguire), a naïve bondsman from the Midwest, who's moved to New York to make his fortune on Wall Street and who also happens to be Daisy's cousin. It is Nick who narrates the tale (in this version from a sanitarium after suffering a mental breakdown from the trauma of the events he's witnessed), claiming to be an objective observer of what's going on around him, but in reality casting moral judgments on the people he encounters all along the way.<br /><br />  It's easy to understand why the filmmaker was drawn to the material in the first place. With its wild parties and overall air of carefree abandon, the era practically screams out for the Baz Luhrmann treatment. But does the novel? I'm not so sure. The problem is that &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is about so much more than just unrestrained partying, and the director (along with his co-writer Craig Rearce) often seems oblivious to that fact. Luhrmann typically drenches his film in all sorts of visual razzmatazz, but the result is that the movie is so over-stylized that the characters are all too often reduced to caricatures and the whole thing to the level of a cartoon. The parties themselves become out-of-control orgies as seen through the lens of Simon Duggan's hurdy-gurdy, hyper-kinetic camera. Meanwhile most of Fitzgerald's nuance and subtlety are wiped away in the phantasmagoria. A case in point is the first appearance of Gatsby in the story. In the novel he literally sneaks up on Nick - and us - as just another anonymous and inconspicuous party guest who engages Nick in conversation. In the movie, his entrance is greeted with a literal display of pyrotechnics. The stylization extends to the d&eacute;cor as well, which often reflects &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; more than 1920s Long Island. Nick looks like he lives in an enchanted forest attached to Gatsby's mansion, which has more turrets than Blahousie Castle and manicured grounds that would put the Palace of Versaille to shame.<br /><br />  Viewed another way, however, Luhrmann's approach seems to make a certain amount of sense. The grandiose, over-the-top theatricality, and stiff, yet, at the same time, over-emotive acting are aptly reflective of the silent movies of that era. It's hard to actually evaluate the performances since the actors have clearly been instructed to ham it up as much as possible (especially Edgerton). At times, they come across as little kids engaged in dress-up and playacting. But in the context of this particular film, is that necessarily a bad thing? (I will say that Robert Redford cut a more impressive figure as Gatsby than Di Caprio does here).<br /><br />  And there's one other thing that can be added to the movie's win column: its overall manic energy, which seems a direct attempt to avoid at all costs replicating the mistakes of the heavy, inert 1974 version.<br /><br />  Luhrmann knows that he is treading on sacred ground here and he clearly doesn't care. He's going to give us &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; as HE envisions it and to hell with the rest of us. In this age of artistic timidity and over-cautious commercial calculation, that attitude turns out to be both admirable and refreshing when you come to think of it.kinetic camera.

B000JMKSE2|5.0|After reading Free and was drawn to another Chris Anderson book and enjoyed every chapter.<br /><br />If you are interested in culture, big data, information technology, making money or all of the above then reading this book will be time well spent.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very good it really makes you think but at the same time its not too difficult (its justs right)<br />I am really glad I got this
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This game worked well on my kindle fire hdx. The gameplay is fairly easy but I enjoyed not having to buy anything to complete it. Recommended!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is fun and awsome and it has a lot of puzzles I really like this game
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Just one quarter through so far and it doesn't seem to be so very long as the ny review suggested -- Dickensian detail not withstanding. Goldfinch might in fact be a five star review but then it seems not as believable.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Excellent, touching book that I could not put down.  Seems to be fairly balanced in dealing with the subject of a child being different.
0375869026|5.0|Love this book it is a life lesson and the way everybody should give their life a meaning! Amazing book!
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|This was a fulfilling and satisfying read and one of those books that keeps you turning the pages hungrily!  With twists and turns, the variety of viewpoints and perspectives gave it a fullness and richness.  The detailed complexity made it a book that required an immediate re-read.  Very proud to be a kiwi!  Congratulations Eleanor Catton on a terrific achievement.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was interested in the erotic elements of this hyped series, but the writing was so poor and so terribly redundant that I was bored to tears.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|addictive game, as soon as you beat a level you just have to make it to the next level and beat it as well!!  great game.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I really like this game.  I like hidden object games, but the variety in this game gave me many hours of enjoyment.  The pop ups are somewhat annoying, but I didn't mind them all that much.  I recommend this game for people like me who are not good with the running and shooting kind.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt is true wordsmith and plot twister.  Eloquently written! One of the best reads I've had in a long time.
0770437400|3.0|Solid writing. And it's very interesting. That said, there seemed to be a little too much trope for my tastes. Lots of working class hero stuff which didn't seem to fit with reality. Same with the 'reactions' of some of the nations. Sure there's some basis, but over all it seemed a little much...  Nevertheless, it was solid and Mr. Brooks surely knows how to play with tension. I finished this in a few days. If anything it's solid story telling (the part where he interviews multiple people so you can't really follow a single person's character was a bold move and I think it pays off. This doesn't read like a normal book but it's great coverage), some of the best, actually. For that you should read it. It's definitely not deep.
055357342X|4.0|It is a very good book. I read through it so fast and I can't wait to read next one.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Being a Dexter fan ive seen all 8 seasons now. Prior to buying season 8 i saw all the terrible reviews and almost didn't buy it feeling better not knowing. I felt compelled to write this review because in my opinion season 8 is very well done. This show has been about character development from season 1, if you buy season 8 expecting the same character interactions as season 1 you will be disappointed. The whole point of the show was watching dexter develop from a sociopath to a human being with real emotions. Season 8 accomplishes this, the other characters have had 8 years of developing too. Hannah Mckay comes back and is a definite asset to the show. I saw reviews blasting the shows writing and storyline, in my opinion its not worse, its a different season with a different storyline, attempting to button up eight years of story and character developement. If you are a dexter fan i would reccommend watching this season, and if you are new to the show watch it from season 1 forward, this is one of the few shows i would go back and watch all over. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching the conclusion to one of the best shows on television.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Better than the OE cable. charge faster and more convenient. A bit pricey, but it worth the spending. Satisfied customer here.
1400082773|5.0|I heard that first speech when it was televised by the Democratic National Committee and this young dreamer/speaker compelled me to listen.  And that was before he was known nationally.  I wanted to know more about this man whose vision for America coincided with my own.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Can't wait to read the second book. Exceptional, thriller, scifi, mystery all in one. If you like this, you will love daemon and freedom.
0786868724|5.0|Having read his other book Tuesdays with Morrie, I knew I liked this author's writings.  I was still surprised at his personal account of faith as he experienced it, in intermittent life experiences, as I have myself.

0307237702|5.0|I needed to know what Barack Obama's vision was for America, prior to backing him as he ran for the Presidency.  And I'm very happy we are fortunate to have this President leading us.  As he said when he first was elected, making change happen is like changing the course of a very big boat.  And we would have to help.  I only wish the voices of those who wished for what he offered would speak up as often and as passionately as those who wanted him to fail and said so on the very first day.  This President has great audacity,  hope and courage, and I think this book reveals that.
B000FCK65W|4.0|Taken back to the early 1900's and the struggles of a poor young girl.  Where a nickel bought dinner for a family and a few dollars a week was a good income.  The struggles and determination of Francie kept me rooting for her along  her journey.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, there is nothing not to like about this film. Production, filming, acting, all gets 5 stars from me. The story line is believable for the most part...why didn't Shawn's brother see Zach's car in the driveway when he unexpectedly came back home is a bit of a mystery, but the love scenes are very believable...even though according to Wikipedia both actors, Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe are straight,(not that there is anything wrong with that), the latter having a &#34;little Cody&#34; of his own.<br />This is a must have DVD...get it if you don't have a copy...you would have to be emotionally dead not to enjoy this brilliant love/coming out story.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|A LITTLE too much exposition at the beginning, but it recovered quickly.  Once it did pick up, it was AMAZEBALLS.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I originally downloaded this because on the internet I couldn't watch anything.it was awesome until last night.my kindle was being slow so I erased it.then downloaded it again.it doesn't loads and I can't watch videos.
B00338QENI|5.0|I heard about HeLa cells during my entire education, but it was always accompanied by limited information about the woman behind the discovery. I remember a few classes in which we were told she donated her cells willingly for research. Obviously, that is not the case or else this book would not exist. This book is written very well for people who understand science at various levels, from elementary to expert.
B00EMGUR60|4.0|Lemmy Killmister has ignored his age and come out with another record of material that's made him one of the grandfathers of punk rock and heavy metal. He doesn't slow down or take prisoners. His music doesn't veer much from the expected, but in my opinion that's a good thing. He's got a couple of very excellent blues numbers on &#34;Aftershock&#34; that testify to his roots and range.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I think this is a OK game.Sometimes it gets a little boring when I play at home, but when I play it in the car it feels better. But I still would recommend it to people.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Star Wars Pinball is the most addictive game I've played in years. Having only one table available to start with is more than enough for a long while. Would have liked to invite friends to play via social networks though.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I just finished demo, and I am buying a full version. The game is quite amazing. Good puzzles, a moderately difficult search for items, no HO scenes, and a lot of dialogues. Reminds more of point-and-click adventures of old than modern HO games. Hints are a welcome addition though they are not really necessary. It took me about an hour to finish demo, so I would say the game is about 3-4 hours long. I like graphics, and a story-line. Those who like me prefer supernatural stories may be pleasantly surprised by this game. Definitely worth to be be checked out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|outstanding puzzles and graphics. Puzzles were not too hard but not easy either. Graphics seem to be from late nineteenth century &amp; quite super.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|A good read -- love the Longmire character.  If you enjoy the TV show, you may, like me, enjoy the books even more.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|well, this game is very adicting, but it is kind of a rip off as well. I got this game and the next day my device said it is not eligable to launch this app. I looked that up, and it said that there is a small glitch in this game. if it said that on your divice, all you have to do is delete the app, then get it again. otherwise, this game is so fun :)
B00GSE92F6|1.0|Taking advantage here with such a high price point.  Not doing right by your customers.  So, do I give my money to Amazon or Apple?  Or hopefully the FTC will look into if such a duopoly is in the interests of consumers and maybe investigate, break someone up, or the like.
B006QSLBC6|3.0|I love the movie, but thought I clicked on purchasing a hard copy, it gave me a down load which I didn't want and I cant get my money back. careful what you click on.
B000001FLI|5.0|Sharing a house with a couple of wannabe guitarists circa 1974 they were very excited by this on vinyl. &#34;Roy who?&#34; I said and even I knew the first and last tracks &#34;Sweet Dreams and Hey Good Lookin'&#34; were, well country standards. The latter, beloved by Maori pub bands as a way to pull a wahine (chicks to us). So I was prepared to be unimpressed and then to top it off there was a pure evangelical track &#34;The Messiah Will Come Again&#34;. But the boys persisted in my non guitar player education and said listen to the chops. Well, &#34;Sweet Dreams&#34; an instrumental sets the tone. Country tortured into blues, it grips the soul and wails. Then it is a case of strap in and let the guitar scour out your ears and inner skull at the mercy of a maestro. And if the messiah does make it around sometime, well Mr Buchanan's guitar will have already beaten him to the draw. Sorry. Left me, even though I still find &#34;Hey Good Lookin'&#34; the cuckoo in this nest. But Roy was entitled to cut loose with a warm down to end things on, so who am I to grumble. Made me a fan. Try it-it’s worth the ride. Oh and the boys, never did make it to the big league but somewhere in a saloon bar near you…check ‘em out.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Quick download to my kindle fire hd. Great graphics and smooth play. As a match three player I wasn't too sure about this type of game but the more I play it the more I like it. Very easy to learn. The only thing I am waiting for is the message that says to continue you must purchase the full game. If that happens it will be decision time and I will update this review.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|This is a sick, twisted, sadistic movie! Avoid this movie and don't waste you're time. It is not worth the effort of even considering!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book,for me starts slow. I can see where the information was needed, I just thought it was a bit much. Have to bare with it for a bit before you even get to Ender and his sister<br /><br />Overall a good read.
0425220931|5.0|Victor Wooten is a uniquely gifted individual.  He takes music and spirituality to a different level.  One needs to read this book with an open mind….and allow themselves to be open to all the book shares.  it helps being a musician, but anyone into spirituality will benefit from the messages in the book.  It's not preachy, it's real.  It's simple, yet has a powerful message.  Still haven't figured out who Michael really was…but that's OK.
0060723513|5.0|I'm an avid reader, and this is probably my favorite book of all time.  I read it the first time when I was sixteen, and it literally changed my life.  It completely rattled my typical selfish, materialistic teenager outlook and was a real wake-up call.  But it is a short, easy read.  If you have a teenager, I recommend insisting they read this book at least once.  The world would be a better place if everyone read this.  It is really beautiful.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|Almost every track is brilliant, and while I do not like all of them, I think they are perfect for the movie. Young and Beautiful is my favorite track because it is the theme for the movie and it perfectly and effortlessly captures the essence of Gatsby and Daisy's romance. No Church in the Wild is excellent as used to describe the setting of the story, and even Bang Bang and A Little Party Never Killed Nobody function perfectly into the &#34;big party&#34; theme of the book while still keeping casual and subtle jazz undertones. People who judge the movie for its music clearly don't know what they're talking about, because this soundtrack encompasses the romance, paranoia, scandal, confusion, and anger discussed in the book. Perfect soundtrack for a perfect movie (coming from a Gatsby purist).

B008JFUS5A|5.0|This takes up where the original Hunger Games left off. At the end of the last Games, Catniss thumbed her nose at the sadistic power structure - something that President Snow took in a very personal way. That act of defiance (it looked more like survival at the time, but became a symbol of defiance) ignited something in the vast underclass, something that Snow needs to extinguish at any cost ...<br /><br />The first movie came across as teen power fantasy, thinly coated with chaste romance. Personalities get stronger in this one, like the quiet bravery of Catniss's sister, in her determination to support Caniss. Even the populace takes on a personality - wronged, hurt, looking for something better, and so bad off already that nothing can be worse. Effie, that outrageously costumed media figure, best known for being well known (sound familiar?) sees something too, in her pitiful attempts to ride Catniss's coat-tails. Her neediness becomes palpable in the \\"We're a team, right?\\" moments. Even Snow's grand-daughter, a ten-ish girl innocently following pop trends, takes on a deeper meaning when Catniss is the trend.<br /><br />Saying more would say too much, but there's something much bigger and deeper under way, something that doesn't become apparent until late in the story. It's doesn't give anything away to say that Catniss prevails, and on her own terms, and in a way that makes a sequel not just inevitable but necessary. I'm looking forward to it already.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0061733199|5.0|Best survival, hunting, camping, and outdoor book you will ever buy.  Love this book.  Amazingly well written, not to wordy.  Great pictures and diagrams.  This book costs more than other SAS Survival books but worth the money for the colour pictures.  Same information as black and white SAS books but has hard cover, colour pictures and glossy pages.  Great read.  If you do any sort of outdoor activity this is a must book to get.  Even if you don't do outdoor activities very valuable information for survival in the home.  My favourite survival book I have ever owned.

B003V6L94Q|3.0|When did we become so lazy that the names of the songs are not listed when the tracks are downloaded from the CD to a device.  I might understand this if, the CD was a knockoff or something, but it isn't.  If you purchase the regular 14 song edition of ZBB's &#34;You Get What You Give&#34;, the downloaded track listings from the CD are as follows: 1 Let it Go; 2 Track 2; 3 Track 3; 4 Track 4; 5 Track 5; 6 Track 6; 7 Track 7; 8 Track 8; 9 Track 9; 10 Track 10; 11 Track 11; 12 Track 12; 13 Martin; 14 Make this Day.  This is only the case if you download from the CD to a device or PC.  If you download the mp3 from the Amazon, the full song names and corresponding tracks are given.  This may not be a big deal to most, but I like to know the names of the songs, I like to know who composed the song.<br /><br />The music is the same ZBB Carribean Country we've come to love.  Just wish I could tell you the names of the songs that are standouts on the CD!<br /><br />Annoyed!
B001FA0W5W|4.0|A great read if you are into financial markets or applied probability. I liked the philosophical approach, but most of all the references to classics and the anecdotes.  You can tell that the author loves his subject.<br /><br />Sometimes the style gets a bit patronizing for my taste, but the book is worth bearing it.  Although the book deals with some deep issues, it should be easy to understand for non-mathematically-prepared readers. I'm looking forward to the next work by Dr. Taleb - how about something on sports instead of finance?

B00E0F9J44|5.0|I found this disc to be perfectly delightful  The material was interesting,  the arrangements clever, and the production suitably puts Ms. Kent's beautiful voice up front.  Tomlinson's sax was, as always, a perfect match for her voice and there were moments when you could not tell which of the two was starting the new musical phrase.  I have already played it many times.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I'm not quite certain why it has taken me so many years to read this series, but it has.  I thoroughly enjoyed Ender's Game but would have preferred either a bit more detail at the end or something more of a defined conclusion with a promise for additional stories rather than the scanty synopsis as it stands.  I highly recommend the book for an elder audience capable of looking back over their lives and wondering.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Great lullaby for the past week. This book repeatedly put me to sleep within minutes. I forced myself to finish and all I can say is that I'm done.  Couldn't put down the first two books (read them back to back) and pissed off my husband with my constant reading. With Allegiant he kept asking if I was done with the series yet because I just couldn't get through it! I can't believe the author completely dropped the ball on her own story. She really should have gotten some help with writing the third book. She really displayed her ignorance for all things scientific. I don't consider myself to be an intellect but when I read a book I expect to feel that the person writing it is smarter than me. I had a hard time putting a label on how I felt about this book and her writing. I ignored all plot holes in the first two books because I was gearing up for the big twist. The fact there was never going to be a clever twist has led me to feel like the whole series was a fraud. Goodbye Tobias and Tris. You guys were frauds because you are boring characters pretending to be interesting.  I might see the movie when it's on Amazon Prime instant video.  Might. Don't waste your time unless you want to commiserate with those of us who already have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey captured my imagination. In the tradition of classic science fiction, like &#34;Childhood's End&#34; or &#34;Ender's Game,&#34; this well written book painted a vivid picture of both the characters and premise in my mind.  It carried me on to a conclusion where I wanted to learn more. Each time I think back on the stories I add a few more of my own, while considering, &#34;What would have happened if...?&#34;
0545615402|5.0|Gave it as a present - she loved the books and read them in one day.  I read them as well and must say I liked the idea of the books, library books with little notes, comments of the main characters.  This were done for a charity, so kudos to the author for doing this and doing an excellent job.

B003VTZTU8|5.0|I had never even heard of Ben Goldacre until I picked this book up at my local library. After reading it, I won't forget him (and I'll actually BUY one or two of his books).  I'm a geologist by training, so I pride myself on at least knowing rational thought and at least understanding statistics. In the chapter on &#34;why clever people believe stupid things&#34;, however, I found myself struggling to remember the difference between &#34;median&#34;, &#34;mean&#34;, and &#34;mode&#34;. (OK mean was easy). Once I got it correct, I turned to my husband (mr smarty pants engineer) and even he had to pause and think about median and mode. So, maybe we weren't so smart after all. I was also horrified to find I am just as susceptible (lazy??) as anyone else to agreeing with and being swept along by &#34;bad science, badly explained&#34;.<br /><br />Some of the review comments for this book say that most people like the book but didn't like the holy-than-thou tone that author wrote the book in. Are you kidding me?? Have any of you reviewers talked to your local yoga guru or homeopathy enthusiast or even your Mom and Dad? Mr. Goldacre hits the nail on the head when he says &#34;You can't reason people out of something they didn't reason themselves into&#34; (think about it for a minute). Almost all of these people who espouse bad medicine are speaking with great charismatic emotion, I-know best, and &#34;it worked for me so it will work for you&#34; attitudes. At least Mr. Goldacre's advice is peppered with humor and real-life examples. And he should be slightly hysterical (with righteous indignation) at the frauds perpetuated by many individuals, who seem to care nothing about educating other people, but then help themselves to large monetary &#34;rewards&#34;.<br /><br />It's all too easy to say this book &#34;preached to the choir&#34; and &#34;not sure who the target audience was&#34;, but let's give the author his due...he is shining his beacon of light into a rat-hole of dark and misery. He at least got off his duff and did something. The rest of us sit in our high, comfortable, ivory towers thinking, &#34;it's no use, THOSE PEOPLE will never get it&#34;. Well, of course, those people will never get it if they can cause a public scandal in the UK (Andrew Wakefield), misrepresent data, and then ride off to Texas into another job (to start playing anew on people's fears) without real fear of discovery or repercussion. Somehow, somewhere, and maybe all the time, the rest of us scientists need to get out of our peer groups and start engaging the general public.<br /><br />A good start would be for all of us to read this book and then go talk to our Mom about those 5 mango and elderberry pills she takes every day and swears by. Does she know what homeopathy really is? Who makes those pills? What is really in them? I had no idea what homeopathy really was until Mr. Goldacre explained it in a chapter (Dilution of 30C is an original substance diluted by one drop in a hundred, thirty times over...or a 1 followed by 60 zeros). Go to a nearby yoga studio and found out what is worthwhile and what isn't so you have some perspective.<br /><br />I thought Mr. Goldacre did a fine, nay great, job in explaining everything clearly and eloquently. Indeed, we should be studying the power of the mind in detail...and advancing that science instead of wallowing in endless junk science. The power of the placebo should inspire us all.of dark and misery. He at least got off his duff and did something.

B009CVRQLY|3.0|It  is an interesting album and yes  Celine is using her voice in a different way after many years of sticking to a tried and true formula .<br /> Does it make me want to play  this CD  again and again .. Nope !!<br />  A whole album and not one of her songs which  demonstrates the extensive range of her voice .. OK i know you are tired of the song from Titanic but  surely you could have found just one song that reminded me that this was Celine Dione ..<br />  I recently saw her being interviewed about this album and it seemed like she was trying to convince herself she was happy with  new path she had taken and the outcome which is this album  ..<br /> Really !!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Good fun for all age groups. Some easy and some take time to find. Enjoyed both in the series. Enough levels to keep one busy for awhile.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a fun game. Sometimes the levels are frustrating, but it's definitely fun and dangerously addictive. Try not to let the number of lives get you down and you'll play this all the way to level 400.
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|The writing in the tv series is frankly far superior to the books.  I found the writing to be a bit trite and predictable, and it gave me even more admiration for the actor who played Dexter.  His phrasing and timing of dialogue was far better than the authors.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|This Superman is dark and brooding. The young Clark (whoever the Brit actor is) broods and pouts and at times yells disrespectfully to his father. That was NEVER in the real Superman concept.  This character brooded and brooded through most of the movie and finally got up enough gumption to wake up and start protecting the world from a sociopathic soldier from Krypton planning on destroying Earth.<br /><br />The actor was not attractive and balding. Lois was frumpy and bloated in her face. She swore and joked about men's private parts. She dressed terribly and had no manners. She was in scenes where she did not belong in. Like flying around in a military cargo plane attempting to attack the bad guys. Superman's uniform looked like dark blue waffle long johns. His cape was just a big piece of dark velvet cloth. Of course the colors HAD to be dark.<br /><br />Clark's mom and dad (both in Krypton and Earth) were redeeming actors--Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe added class whenever they were in the movie.The rest of the cast was just set dressing.<br /><br />Towards the end there was so much smashing and destroying, it got to sound like a bad video game. Superman against the bad guys. Smashing up entire cities and sky scrapers. Lois always nearby panting with fear that her heartthrob might get hurt. Yawn. Pleeze, someone kill the other already..... the fight scenes lasted so long I started looking for knitting needles to poke my eyes out..<br /><br />This movie was a very poor representation of the character and the morals behind the Superman concept. I'm sure there will be a sequel. I can't imagine how it will be any worse.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this one, I'm sorry I wasted a free rental pass on this junk heap.

B005LAJ1PE|5.0|great!  I really love these series. I like the fact they use the same characters yet have completly different stories. The newest one &#34;Coven&#34; is awesome.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|This was a difficult review to write.  The video is amazing, as are all videos related to  Cirque du Soleil, very entertaining, great costumes and make up. The reason it only got 3 stars, is because the video is sooooo short, it was basically half way through the popcorn.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|A true story and very well written.  An amazing story.  Pelieliu is an unknown part of our military history and this story fills in that missing history. Any WWII buff should read this book.

B00AO3K05S|5.0|This concept is not new,but the manner and style of the writing takes it from the fringes into the mainstream. And the more people realise this and the more we move away from the sleazy used car salesperson image, the better for everyone concerned.Selling is as old as mankind himself and will continue to be the cornerstone of how humans survive. So read the book,take in the lessons,implement them and assist yourself and your family to have a better life. Mr. Pink captures all of this and more in this highly entertaining and informative read.
B003ZZAXFO|5.0|This album has all the thoughts in my head that I've never been able to express. Especially about amnesia. I've never heard a song express the fear and sorrow that I felt when I suffered amnesia for a day.<br />The lyrics touch me, but the music itself is inspiring.

0316055433|3.0|The Goldfinch could have been a great book--five stars, no question, if only Tartt had had a decent editor.  Her periodic loss of control of her material reminds me of Thomas Wolfe at his worst.  While I really enjoyed the overall plot and theme of the book--that great beauty exists in the midst of hideous ugliness, which parallels the human situation-- I too often found myself rolling my eyes and thinking, GET ON WITH IT, especially during some of the interminable explanatory conversations toward the end.

B0026J8LHM|3.0|This is a 'good' Dream Theater album.  It certainly isn't one of their best, but isn't downright horrible like Train of Thought.  Basically, it has its hits (&#34;The Shattered Fortress&#34;, the epic conclusion to The Twelve Step Suite, and &#34;Nightmare to Remember&#34;, an awesome album opener and musical roller coaster) and its misses (The generic &#34;Wither&#34; and the also generic &#34;Rite of Passage&#34;).<br />So what makes this album &#34;good&#34; (as opposed to great)?  Well, there's nothing particularly standout fantastic about it.  Petrucci and Portnoy, as always, deliver a great performance, but don't venture outside of their comfort zones or try anything new.  As usual (at least with every release since TOT), Myung can barely be heard.<br />One standout thing though: James does a fantastic job on this album.  Seriously, I don't think it is too far-fetched to say that this album contains some of his strongest singing since &#34;Awake&#34;.<br />And then we have Jordan.<br />Don't get me wrong, his playing is great.  But I have two issues with him on this album.  First, it seems like he took a very formulaic approach to these songs.  Kind of the same thing over and over again... Low heavy organ sound to double the guitar riffs, strings for the epic pieces, piano for the softer parts, electric piano when there's a slow 'bridge' area, same lead synth sound for the solos.  Though he does experiment with the continuum and iPod (yes, he plays the iPod on this album), his playing is, as I said, formulaic.<br />The second issue I have is... you can't hear him most of the time.  And this is a huge disappointment.  I recently purchased the keyboard transcriptions book for this album, and found out that Rudess really does some amazing piano arrangements on some of these songs (The Best of Times, after the guitars come in, before and during the first verse, or on the Shattered Fortress, as its coming out of the middle section before the guitar solo).  Yet, when you go to listen to the song, the piano is barely audible... if at all.  Its a huge shame really.  I don't know if he wants it that way, but if I put a lot of work into a piano part for a song and recorded it, I'd be pretty mad if the album came out and no one could even hear it.  I know this is typical for Dream Theater albums, for the keyboards to be buried in the mix, but on this album it is the worst.  And I get it, they're going for a more guitar-oriented, heavy metal sound, but they could have turned the piano up and it would still be very &#34;metal&#34;.<br />Bottom line: Hit and miss album, not much else to say.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I have been reading Hyperbole and a Half for several years now and I was thrilled when the book came out. It met all of my expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed this. It is quick, funny, thought provoking and all around enjoyable. You cannot go wrong getting this book. On a side note, the kindle version of this book comes out just fine on my iPad all the pictures and text are in the correct place.
B005974CNA|5.0|The first Dream Theater album to not include drummer Mike Portnoy.<br />This is an excellent album where Dream Theater expertly walks the fine line between maintaining their classic sound fans have come to know and love while simultaneously experimenting and expanding their musical horizons.<br />Jordan Rudess in particular shines on this album.  Unlike some previous DT albums where he took a sort of formulaic approach to each song, here he can be heard experimenting with new sounds and orchestration styles, the result of which is fantastic and does not fail to keep the music interesting.<br />Mike Mangini's drumming isn't exactly stand out... but that's probably becuase he wasn't incorporated in the album writing process since its inception.  Like Patrick Moraz joining Yes late into the writing of Relayer, Mangini didn't really get the chance to express himself fully, and that really shows as the drumming is solid but kind of generic.<br />John Myung's performance on this album is... well I really can't say.  90% of the time you can't even hear him.  Not his fault, its the mix I know.<br />James Labrie sounds like he is kind of holding back on his singing, but still delivers a nice performance.<br />Petrucci is smooth as ever.  His tone is amazing and his solos are memorable and excellent.<br />Quick side-note: I have noticed that most of the songs are structurally exact copies of songs from Images and Words.  On the Backs of Angels = Pull Me Under, Lost Not Forgotten = Under A Glass Moon, Outcry = Metropolis Pt. 1, Far From Heaven/Breaking All Illusions = Wait For Sleep/Learning to Live.  Interesting, for sure.<br />Anyways, my verdict is that this is a great album, one of Dream Theater's best releases, sure to please fans both new and old, and well worth the buy.
B00BD6RFFS|2.0|The electronic version of this book makes it very hard to see the flow of the business model and what the author was trying to portray.  I ended having to buy the full print version to get a clearer picture of how the book is laid out.  To their credit, they mention this in the first title pages, but quite frankly, I didn't think it should be released in a e-version because it's sooooo drastically different.  It really is a &#34;visual&#34; book and the e-version takes that away rendering it useless.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|Dream Theater's latest release and the first to incorporate Mike Mangini since the initial writing process.<br />Musically, this album takes the classic Dream Theater sound that fans have come to know and love, and puts it in a less radical format that is friendlier to people who are new to Dream Theater.  Some people will see this as a bad thing.  I myself, even as a long-time DT fan, find it to be still quite enjoyable.<br />For instance, James really reigns in his singing, and goes into his signature higher ranges very rarely on this album (To me, this is kind of disappointing, but seeing as this is the focal point for much criticism about the band, I think a lot of people will enjoy this change).  John Myung is brought to the front more, a huge improvement over the last few albums where you could listen to the entire album and not even know that Dream Theater has a bass player.  John Petrucci takes a more 'metal' approach and uses a seven string or detuned seven string on almost every song on the album, as opposed to previous albums where he used these extended ranges more sparingly.  Rudess is crazy on the keyboards as usual but stays more out of the spotlight.  As for Mike Mangini, his contributions to the album do not have the same amount of 'personality' that Portnoy had, but he nonetheless delivers an intriguing new drumming style that fills up the rhythm but isn't so in-your-face.  Also, he does some of his signature polyrhythms that just make the album that much more awesome.<br />So, musically this album is pretty solid.  There is a driving metal song, a fun instrumental, a soaring epic, a couple of sappy ballads, a thinly-veiled Rush tribute (The Looking Glass), and some good old fashioned prog that classic DT fans will appreciate.  I just have one major complaint about this album...<br />The mix.<br />I am not an audiophile and rarely do I care about the mix.  But this is just awful.  I think they were trying to go for a new type of sound or something,but it did not work.  First, the most obvious problem is the drums.  They sound fake... the cymbals sound like they had way to much noise gate applied, the kick and toms sound like bad drum programming software, and the snare... most of the time you can't even tell it's a snare.  This new type of drum sound is kind of appropriate for fast, heavy songs like &#34;The Enemy Inside&#34;, but on other songs like &#34;The Looking Glass&#34; and &#34;Along for the Ride&#34;, it is very out of place and detracts from the quality of the song.  However, that is not the main issue.<br />The main problem I have is a problem that has plagued almost every Dream Theater album, but here is one of the worst instances.  For God's sake, how hard is it to turn up the keys!  Or for at least turn down the guitar.  I'm a guitarist and I love John Petrucci.  But when I have to strain to hear a keyboard SOLO because the guitar (which is just playing some backing riff) is too loud, then that is kind of a problem.  Or where the piano is playing the melody... the main melody... and I can barely hear it over the guitar which is just droning out some power chords... ugh.<br />So bottom line, very musically solid, horrible mix, and an interesting new approach by Dream Theater that does not fail to entertain.

0141027827|4.0|For many of us, history began in 1914 with the beginning of the modern times. We were taught that Germany invaded France by crossing through neutral Belgium, thus breaching various inter-nation conventions and forcing the rest of the civilized (western) world to protect their interests against the invading forces. If we wanted to know more about the background to the First World War it was either a passing reference to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, thirty-seven days before the outbreak of war, or we were told to go to the library and look it up ourselves. We were faced, and still are faced, with two very simple explanations for the war: Germany invaded or the Archduke, heir apparent to the throne of the Habsburg Empire, was assassinated. Education begins after; the modern world begins with conflict.<br /><br />We all must realize that there is considerably more to such a major conflict than just one of these two incidents or a combination of the two. Any good library provides us with a wealth of literature covering the period - many thousands of works have been published over the years - from different sources, from all possible points of views, from victors and victims. Only one point remains in our minds: Germany was the aggressor; Germany is at fault for the mobilization of sixty-five million troops, for the deaths of over twenty million people. But such explanations, such simple causes cannot possibly explain such an event. There must be more to the whole than just an invasion or an assassination.<br /><br />To go right into the depths of this world-changing event, we would need to read through more books, articles and reports, cover more memories from individuals and those involved than it is humanly possible to read or hear in one lifetime. We would need to be able to separate fact from fiction, contemporary memories from later justifications, purple prose from glorification or vilification. And, above all, we would need to be able to remove the prejudices placed in our minds through the educational system and the tales told from different sides of the conflict. That, and the passage of time since those events which not only warp our understanding of events but wrap the times and troubles in mists of modern understanding against knowledge of what the world was like one hundred years ago. A practically impossible task.<br /><br />The events leading up to the First World War have their roots further back than just the second decade of the twentieth century. They were times of great intrigue, of in-fighting, of colonialism, arrogance and the belief in historical sovereignty beyond accepted borders. They were times of complicated and highly secretive political manoeuvering between different countries as much as between political parties; between internal factions and religious beliefs; between power and international business interests.<br /><br />Christopher Clark's book The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went To War In 1914 is an in-depth study of the reasons and reasoning behind the First World War. It outlines both the accepted reasons behind that final mobilization and the detailed and complicated machinations which made such a movement of forces seem necessary, if not vital, to protect individual and sovereign interests across the European continent. The work handles many of the inner workings of councils and governments in the years leading up to the assassination in Sarajevo; the thinking behind the recruiting and arming of the small group of men determined to kill the heir apparent of the Austrian monarchy; the continual movement of men and machines within and across borders; the military build-up and naval power play combined with fascinating insights into the workings and conflicts between civilian politicians and military commanders.<br /><br />Above all it is a tale of arrogance, of conflict, of unstinting belief that only one side was in the right anda refusal to communicate, to diffuse, to mediate. The hundreds of sources used to compile this exceptionally clear and well written work are carefully listed, the players in this European drama dissected alongside their prejudices, their opinions and desire for power or, in some cases, their failings and refusal to accept advice or a minor loss of face. The Sleepwalkers brings new light into a conflict which raged across Europe one hundred years ago, the war to end all wars, the Great War and, at the same time, illustrates how, despite what we should have learned then, such an event could happen again and, in the Thirties, came to be repeated.a refusal to communicate, to diffuse, to mediate.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|The learning curve couldn't be easier, and yet, when I get to the larger boards, it does manage to stump me from time to time, though not enough that I've had to give up on a puzzle yet. There is a fantastic feature that you can enable which puts numbers that correspond to like colors; very helpful for the color-blind like myself. I play this on a Galaxy S4 and have never had lag issues or any glitches that compromise very rapid play in the time trials.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|By the time this book came out, I did not care about the characters anymore. I had moved on to another very different universe and reading a book from this series was like hearing from friends I had drifted away from. Without giving anything away, I can only say that the ending was a complete and total disappointment. This was not for reasons that will become obvious as you near the end of the book, but because it was so insipid. This wonderful series ended with a whimper. What a shame.
0142403873|5.0|This is a great story for 0-6 years old.  My husband has been reading it to my son since he was itty bitty.  He does different voices for all the characters and my son loves that!!  Witty, good flow, good word choices.<br /><br />Please note, however, that we felt that the sequel, &#34;The Gruffalo's Child&#34; missed the mark.<br /><br />We do like other Julia Donaldson books though.  Check out &#34;The Snail and the Whale.&#34;
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book changed the way I eat, period. No more processed foods in my house ever again. Yes, it is a pain in the ass to prepare whole food from scratch. The alternative is a life of obesity, diabetes, kidney failure and suspected cancers.
141694737X|5.0|I have to admit that when I first bought this for our son when he was 6-months old I thought it was lame.  Now that he is 11-months and able to lift the flaps while I read, we both love it.  Simple story, simple illustrations, simply fun for him.  I keep the corresponding stuffed animals in a pile next to us as we read and we pick out which one matches the picture.  Makes the story come alive.  We make the animal sounds too.  Lots of ways to interact and ad-lib with this book.  Fun!

B004K6M0OO|4.0|War is a dirty and often confusing activity and the Spanish Civil War more than many with its confused politics. Orwell captures it well. This is not a heroic tale but one that goes down into the grime.
B000024ZYP|5.0|First of all... John Surman.<br /><br />But aside from that, what's also great about this album is, well, everything.  Here's an album that explores the Middle Eastern roots in jazz, and you have Dave Holland of the Miles Davis band, world class oud, classical and folk, musician  Anouar Brahem, and last but not least John Surman, and that's all you really need.  Everything here is top notch, from concept to composition to instrumentation to performance to recording production, for a sound that is genuinely sublime.

Immediately the scene shifts to the present, where experts are still baffled by exactly what it is they’ve dug up. When a mysterious artefact is unearthed at Giza, tough-minded military man Colonel Jack O'Neill clashes with archaeologist Daniel Jackson over the origin and potential of the object. When Jackson identifies the object as a portal to another world, O'Neill leads him and a team through the ‘STARGATE.’ They are transported millions of light years from Earth where they are stranded on a strange and alien planet. When Ra, the enigmatic ruler of this extraordinary world, discovers that the doorway to Earth can be reopened, he devises a deadly plot. Racing against time, Army Col. Jack O'Neil [Kurt Russell] and Daniel Jackson [James Spader] must overcome Ra if they are to save Earth and find a way back home...<br /><br />By this time the ring has been transported to an underground military site in the United States. In an act of desperation, the researchers bring in Daniel Jackson [James Spader], a brilliant Egyptologist who’s radical and some say insane theories have alienated him from the intellectual mainstream. In short order, Daniel Jackson determines that the ring is actually a sort of map of the heavens that, if properly calibrated, becomes a doorway for instant travel to the far reaches of the universe.<br /><br />‘STARGATE’ which was written by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, holds our attention through a combination of suspense and funky wit. The latter is supplied primarily by James Spader and the truth about Daniel Jackson is that he’s a little daft, which makes him a great character for James Spader. Slowly but surely, James Spader is emerging as one of the most accomplished, watchable actors in the films. With his shaggy hair drooping over his brow, he plays Daniel Jackson as a bumbling egghead lost in his own thoughts.<br /><br />‘STARGATE’ [1994] is a sci-fi film which follows the typical hero's journey style narrative. Here we follow Daniel Jackson as he is thrust into another world after he is brought on board a secret military operation to decipher symbols on a mysterious object that allows travel from one planet to another. When we first meet Jackson he's an outsider on the fringes of academia. His theories are debunked by every serious scientist and he's just about broke. He's approached by a mysterious group who want to employ his services as a translator of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. But what he unearths his far beyond his wildest theories.<br /><br />Not only does James Spader’s comic spin carry us through the first half of the film, it also provides a neat counterpoint to the heavy seriousness of Kurt Russell, who is saddled with the thankless role of Col. Jack O’Neil, the military officer overseeing the project for the government. After Daniel Jackson has deciphered the symbols on the STARGATE, he joins a reconnaissance team that walks through it to the other side of the galaxy. The group, led by Army Col. Jack O'Neil [Kurt Russell], emerges in a desert environment similar to that of Egypt but peopled by a multitude of primitive slaves who mine a precious metal for their master, Ra.<br /><br />Once on the other side of the STARGATE, O’Neil and his team discover that Daniel can’t get them back again. And while they remain stranded, the movie is too, even though the new planet provides some science fiction excitement. The effects conjured up by Peter Mitchell Rubin and Patrick Tatopoulos—including a wonderful lumbering creature that looks to be part elephant and part yak,are inventive, often even thrilling. And as the god Ra, Jaye Davidson is perfectly otherworldly especially when he’s angry, the whites of his eyes glow like headlights.<br /><br />But with nowhere to go, Roland Emmerich treads water with a budding love affair between Daniel and a beautiful slave girl named Sha’uri [Mili Avital] and a trifling plot in which Ra attempts to send a bomb back through the gate to destroy the Earth. Though James Spader’s character dominates the first half of the film, he seems to get lost in the second and even when the character is on screen. By the end, the film’s early promise has pretty much degenerated into routine pyrotechnics.<br /><br />It’s hard to say that Roland Emmerich’s directing is somehow better than subsequent previous work; in fact it may be just the same. I think the reason why ‘STARGATE’ has quality epic performance. The battle scenes in the sand are filled to the brim with total excitement; the special effects are creatively done and integrated quite well without shooting on green screen, worrying about everything around the actors later. All aspects of this film needed to be carefully thought out and orchestrated exactingly, allowing all performers something real to act against; Kurt Russell is perfect as the tough guy with a capacity for compassion and James Spader is full on neurotic eccentric, the odd leading man type he perfected in the 1990s. The rest of the cast consists of familiar faces like John Diehl, Leon Rippy, French Stewart trying way too hard to be badass, and an early Djimon Hounsou and effective parts from the foreigners in Alexis Cruz’s son-like Skaara and Mili Avital’s love interest Sha’uri. Even Jaye Davidson’s Ra, despite his youthful appearance, holds the kind of malicious ego necessary to fear him. Both Kurt Russell and James Spader are amiable enough as the mismatched explorers and the special effects are well up to scratch. Most importantly, there's a sense in which, while it may be ridiculously far-fetched, suspension of disbelief is just about possible as it swings along with a committed gusto rarely seen since the heyday of George Lucas.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – ‘STARGATE’ finally received the high-definition upgrade fans deserve and has a stunning 1080p defined encoded image and an equally stunning 2.40:1 aspect ratio. First and foremost, the colouring problems that plagued the prior version have been corrected this time around, removing the &#34;hot&#34; skin tones, and artificial brightness boosting. On this version, we have a natural colour scheme that accurately reproduces the spectrum of the source material, creating a highly appealing experience. Rounding out the positives, black levels possess incredible depth despite the sun-drenched hues of the desert setting, and contrast offers excellent differentiation through the majority of scenes and only slipping occasionally during dark, indoor shots. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – Not to be outdone by the visual upgrade, the audio experience on ‘STARGATE’ offers an equally impressive experience. The 7.1 DTS-HD HR Master Audio employs a robust sound design that contains a relentless mix of effects and music to create an epic feel. From the booming voices of Ra's bodyguards to the high-pitched wail of the futuristic planes soaring overhead, the audio mix is never bashful in making demands of every speaker throughout your room. There is totally excellent surround separation, lots of clarity and balance in the various elements of the track, the dominant portion of your subwoofer gives a much-needed workout through the multiple explosions, sandstorms and rumbling undertones of the musical score.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Director’s Commentary with Roland Emmerich [Writer/Director] and Dean Devlin [Writer/Producer] [Extended Cut only] This is the same commentary track as featured on a number of previous versions of the film, but it's the first time I've heard it. Surprisingly it's not actually a bad track, although there are quite a few extended periods of dead air. However, when Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin do talk, they provide a lot of pertinent information about the technical side of the project, along with plenty of cast and crew anecdotes. They are also very keen to point out that they had no involvement whatsoever with the STARGATE TV series!<br /><br />Special Feature: STARGATE – History Made [2009] [1080p] [2.40:1 / 1.85:1][22:18] This feature is divided up into 3 category headings, that comprises of the following: Deciphering The Gate: Concepts & Casting; Opening The Gate: The Making of STARGATE and Passing The Gate: The Legacy. Contributing to this new special feature are the following: Roland Emmerich [Director/Writer]; Dean Devlin [Writer/Producer]; Mili Avital [Sha’uri]; Stuart Tyson Smith [Egyptological Consultant]; Eric Avari [Kasuf]; Patrick Tatopoulos [Creature Effects Supervisor] and Frank Gerney [Stargate Fan]. In this first section, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin recall developing the script together and securing financing from foreign sources after being turned down by every American studio, now doesn’t that sound typical and familiar? They also talk about their casting choices, some of which had to be pursued and Kurt Russell turned them down repeatedly. There are a few seconds of interesting footage of Jaye Davidson speaking the Egyptian dialogue in an undubbed voice that will sound truly odd to anyone used to hearing the electronically manipulated voice of Ra in the finished film. Roland Emmerich looks genuinely thrilled that people still tell him they like the film. And any true fan of the film should be able to guess what question Eric Avari is asked the most, which he kindly gives the answer as well.<br /><br />Special Feature: The Making of STARGATE Documentary [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [52:00] This French made documentary, which was luckily filmed in English, was organised according to specific elements of the film, e.g., the STARGATE, the desert, the so-called “mastadge” creature the travellers encounter on the planet, the pyramid structure, etc., and how they were achieved. Perhaps the most entertaining participant is visual effects supervisor Jeffrey Okun, who seems to take an almost child-like delight in the things that go wrong. Contributing to this 2001 special are the following: Joel B. Michaels [Co-producer]; Kurt Russell [Actor]; Joseph Porro [Chief Costumier]; Roland Emmerich [R&eacute;alisteur and Co-sc&eacute;nariste]; Dean Devlin [Co-sc&eacute;nariste and Co-prolucteur]; James Spader [Actor]; Mili Avital [Actress]; Jeffrey Okun [Responsible des Effets Sp&eacute;ciaux Num&eacute;riques]; Peter Mitchel Rubin [Graphiste and Storyboarder]; Patrick Talopoulos [En Charge de Cr&eacute;atures]; Andy Armstrong [Regleur des Casades]; Docteur Stuart Smith [&Eacute;gyptologue]; Antoine Bonsorte [Responable des Bas-reliefs] and Peter Murton [Directur Artisque].<br /><br />Special Feature: Is There A STARGATE? [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [12:10] With this feature we have Erich von D&auml;niken [Author of Chariots of the Gods], with a brief overview of his theories. The documentary footage of various phenomena claimed by Erich von D&auml;niken as evidence of prehistoric visits by extra-terrestrials is entertaining. Whether it convinces anyone is a different question. We also get a contribution from Giorgio Tsoukalos [Editor in Chief of Legendary Times]. Narrated by Gene Ross. It was an Artisan Home Entertainment presentation.<br /><br />Special Feature: Original STARGATE Previews [1994] [480i] [1.33:1] [17:18] You get to view 5 separate Preview Promotional vignettes. But sadly most of it is repeated information about the film STARGATE.<br /><br />Special Feature: B-Roll footage [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:02] This is random piece of filming, especially views of behind-the-scenes of filming ‘STARGATE.’ There is no commentary, but in the background you get to hear the main theme music of ‘STARGATE.’<br /><br />Special Feature: Never-Before-Seen Gag Reel [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:12] Shot in one long extended take that is supposedly entitled a “parody reel,” and who ever thought up this ludicrous title, should be sacked. Here you get to see a lot of not so funny choreographed idiots making a fool of themselves and sadly features appearances by Kurt Russell, Roland Emmerich, physical effects supervisor Kit West and dozens of other crew, and it parodies numerous familiar moments from STARGATE to the accompaniment of the all-too-familiar soundtrack. At the end of this rubbish, we get to see the wording COMING SOON TO A THEATRE NEAR YOU, well I hope not, as it is the most stupid idiotic thing I have seen in a very long time and it is not at all funny and complete was of celluloid film and again it is not at all funny.<br /><br />Special Feature: Picture-in-Picture “STARGATE Ultimate Knowledge” [1994] [1080p] [2.40:1] [130 minutes] Mario Kassar presents a Le Studio Canal + / Centropolis Film Production in Association with Carolco Pictures Inc. Exploiting the Blu-ray’s advanced capabilities, this feature allows the viewer to play the extended cut with a PIP at the lower right containing both interview and on-set footage. Much of the interview footage appears to date from the film’s production. Also, a substantial portion of the material is recycled from the documentaries and features provided as separate extras.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [1994] [1080i] [1.85:1] 2:38] This is the film’s Original Theatrical Trailerbut one thing I do not understand why they could not instead included the 2.40:1 aspect ratio Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />BD-Live: This Blu-ray Disc uses the Blu-ray format’s online function [BD-Live] to access additional dynamicHD content. Please make sure that your Blu-ray Player is connected to the Internet and latest player firmware is installed. It also asks you whether you would like to continue, with either Yes or No.<br /><br />Finally, ‘STARGATE’ is one of those sci-fi films that I have watched first the inferior NTSC DVD and now this wonderful Blu-ray disc thatI care to admit, and it is up there at the top of my sci-fi favourites list, especially as I do enjoy its novel twist on the origins of the ancient Egyptian civilisation. Fans of the film may well be wondering why they should stump up for yet another video copy of this film, but if you want the best possible audio-visual presentation then there really is no alternative. Fans have waited a long time for a really good version of ‘STARGATE,’ but the wait is finally over. Will this be the last time the film gets released on disc? If you haven't seen ‘STARGATE,’ and you do not have a fleeting interest in science fiction, please give it a try and get this “Ultimate Edition” Blu-ray disc, as it is well worth purchasing and I am so glad it has been now been added to my Kurt Russell Collection. The only thing that really ages this sci-fi film is Kurt Russell's hair and the CGI effects which now look a little rough around the edges, but were cutting edge in their time; otherwise this is a totally timeless sci-fi classic.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Read this book as part of a book club and I am so glad. it held my interest the entire time.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|An exceptional film, portraying war as if you were there amongst those Men of Steel as few other films do.  Acquire this film for your library, and make sure to get the uncut version (not the director's cut) to make the most of the experience.  The directors cut removes almost 90 minutes of film.  ALSO......the film is best viewed in the original German language with English subtitles.  The English dubbing is not very effective.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|If this isn't the best teen film ever made, I'll eat my black Stetson. Wonderful story and script, much \\"deeper\\" than one might expect, directly superbly by the book's author. Great performances by all the principals, and check out the kid protagonist-- remarkable performance.

I feel more creative. I have lot of energy. I feel rested.<br /><br />I feel stupid for thinking that I was not good enough to go for my big goals in life.
0307887960|5.0|OMG - can't count the diets I have been on.  This is the very best yet.  A little tough in the beginning with only protein but as soon as you incorporate the oat bran in the morning (had to order it) and lost 10 pounds in 7 days it was more than easy to add a little veggies and switch up one day protein and one day mixed or any of the other plans that work.  I can see if you follow this without cheating at all you can easily reach the third stage which gives a lot more to eat and set a life plan for maintaining a good loss and staying slim and healthy.  Best thing I have done in years!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Fantastic bio of the history of The Eagles!<br />I have watched it 4 times, The Eagles are a true American treasure. I brought  2 extra CDs for  Christmas gifts.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|got daughter these and mommy a candle with a surprise in it.  You can order the size ring here http://www.jewelscent.com/430139
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome ever since I got it I loved it<br /><br />Pokemon crystal walkthrough part of<br />Com is a good idea that the same thing as well done to know each other company is looking for the mega cD and DVD
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors.  I am addicted to legal subject novels.  Can hardly wait for his next one.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I loved this book as much as the first one!!! Great story and voice of the main character. I can't wait to read the last book to see if she finally pulls it off!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much.  I have a horse of my own and it is just like doing everything I do at the stables but it is vertrill is it awesome.
B009CFXPTM|5.0|Okay, I'll probably get booed out of thee review club for this, but I actually liked this movie. It might be only due to the fact that I like both of the stars. Pierce Brosnan hasn't had many bad roles, and even though Linda Hamilton has not been as fortunate, i still like her.<br /><br />Maybe it's the 'Terminator' effect. I still think they are some of the best Sci-Fi's out there!
B0067RQYNW|3.0|its not Microsoft Word.... But it's very close, I have used it to create simple documents and it works just fine. Obviously you cwould have more options for page layout....but otherwise it's a very good app.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|Noomi Rapace caught my eye in the Millenium Series, and though this role wasn't near as good as that, she still manages to come off better than the script that was written for her. And I'm sorry, but Charlize Theron has some kind of fascination with 'dark, brooding  types' she's been mostly known for.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I thought the game was not bad. I have definitely played some better ones. The game needs to fix a few problems along the lines of loading issues when going to battle others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would highly recommend this game to horse lover's. It teaches the basics of caring for a horse!!! This is an AWSOME game!!
B008ZCWFEE|4.0|My autistic son, age 12 has really struggled with the algebra concepts, but this game is perfect for him since he interprets picturegrams better than numbers as a stand alone. It's helped his understand distribution and even fractions a little easier and is a good start! It's also a great refresher for myself.<br /><br />The only issue...the reason I'm going 1 star down is that it loads upside down? We basically have to turn it upside down and then lay and leave it flat. A little frustrating but not a huge problem if we just leave it flat.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy playing candy crush.  My only complaint is that there is no way to advance even if your stuck for months.  This probably is why people stop playing.  There should be a way to advance, especially if you've tried a level a gazillion times!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Fun and addictive but likes to force stop on my extreme android tablet almost every time I try to play. It takes up my lives and I'm forced to wait just for it to mess up again. Any suggestions or ideas?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you love solving puzzles. This is the game for you.  And if you do need help there is enough cheat apps out there.. LOL.  Haven't. had todo that too much!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is such a clever, strange dystopian story. I felt the claustrophobia of the silo even if the characters in the book didn't. I like how Howey crafted a full world when people  are surviving with strict rules and not asking questions. Of course it all falls apart but theoretically it hundreds of years to go to pot.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Here i got 2 of these, one for my older son and myself. We would love to online and i had just started online gaming. We both love the sound and quality of these earphones. its comfortable light weight and great sounding.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Good graphics.  Fun and entertaining.  Doesn't take long to expand your kingdom and explore new territory.  A good game to help pass the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a great game. Love playing it. Even my four year old daughter loves playing candy crush. Try it everyone.
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|Loved it! Love it! So funny but also heart-felt and insightful. Allie Brosch, thank you for sharing! I am a follower of her blog and I hope we get to hear much more from her!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|For anyone who's new, CAREFUL WHEN YOU FEEL AN EVIL PRESENCE WATCHING YOU, CAREFUL WHEN YOU SEE AN OLD MAN NEAR A FORTRESS, DON'T MESS AROUND WITH WORM FOOD, AND MAKE SURE NOT TO THROW ANY VOODOO DOLLS INTO THE LAVAS OF HELL
B00GH4R95C|3.0|First, the good: the special effects were impressive, and boy, there were a lot of them. Toward the end, hardly a thing was left standing. Poor New York gets it again, with buildings collapsing, exploding, imploding, shattering, falling, etc. The scene where Superman discovers flying was really well done. Henry Cavill looks ah-ma-zing in that suit, let me tell you, mmm-mmm. Now for the bad. This is a very serious Superman. It lacked the charm and humor of the Christopher Reeves Superman, and that's okay, I guess, but it got to be kind of boring after a while. Poor little Clark, picked on by bullies and his ever-so-serious dad being ever so serious about the whole thing. I thought the external plot was good - I liked that Gen. Zod was motivated to save his entire race -- too bad he wasn't so temperamental and looked to another habitable planet - surely there was another one nearby (Mars?). Seemed like they could have worked something out... Anyhow, the thing that bugged me the most, beyond the boring bits and the weird sepia cast to most of the movie, was the religious, Jesus-y overtones. Oh, Clark is 33! What a co-inky-dink! He leaves the ship and assumes the crucifix position. Not too subtle there. And he keeps getting lectured on how he's going to save everyone, and we're reminded that &#34;he saved us all!&#34; Good grief... I really wondered if they'd allow Sup to kiss Lois at the end or if they were going to maintain his priestly purity. Anyhow, it was worth a rental but overall was a little too in love with itself and its &#34;message&#34; to be truly entertaining, just my opinion.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|This one has it all. In the style of the old masters (or mistresses), the &#34;perp&#34; is hidden 'till the end. A Damn Good Read!
6304806418|5.0|Great video.  Madonna was clearly the deserved Oscar winner for her outstanding performance.  Shows how politics still reigns in Hollywood.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Another Jack Reacher triumph. Waiting to the end to find out what happens suits me fine. More please Mr Child!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Incredibly researched and seemingly unbiased history.  It prompted me to read more about the &#34;bibles&#34; and clarified the distinction between the historical and religious Jesus.  Interestingly, much of the book was on the history of the times surrounding Jesus's life and not so much on his life--which admittedly was short in span but huge in impact.  Establishes that he was one of many itinerant evangelists of that time and also one of an enormous number of people crucified for defying Rome.  As is clearly stated, Christianity's dominance has occured largely on the belief that Jesus actually rose from the dead to be with God, adding hope to believers that there is an after life.  I think this is a book that should appeal to both believers and those who are not, even if you don't agree with the facts or conclusions.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works same as being on face book any other way.  Makes it easy to access your friends and family from any where
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|It was good, not as good as the first, but still very entertaining. It was cool that all the original actors were back, and definitely worth owning.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Plays videos great!<br />Really enjoyed this app very simple to use.  Never have had any problem so far works petfect
B008220DGE|1.0|I loved Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood, so I was hoping this would be a good way to spend my time.  Nope.  Depressing, confusing, odd, wierd, boring, just plain stupid.<br /><br />I did watch the whole film hoping it had a redeeming message somewhere, but nope-nothing but a silly, tacked on happy ending that really made no sense at all.  It was like oh well we gotta end this mess so lets try this....?<br /><br />Dont waste your time.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|The disco beat and arrangements were a little off-putting on first listen, but faded quickly. The record is just busting with musical invention and lyrical fascination. &#34;Here Comes the Night Time&#34; is the standout track.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|You can feed the cute animals. It's a great family game! You get to level up and visit other villages.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Enjoyed it from beginning to end.  I read fiction for entertainment and this certainly kept me entertained.  Hope he keeps writing.
B0000X61VE|2.0|This workout feels very unnatural to me, and the pace is odd. I would not suggest this to others, but that is just me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|There was plenty unbelievable but enjoyed the concept.  As always on the legal thrillers that we get from John Grisham
B0000X61UU|4.0|I've always liked this workout. It uses a lot of upper body repetitions with lower weight. I also like that the sets move along w/ enough variety that you don't feel bored, and even when you feel like you might get tired - the variety in sets keeps you motivated.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|My three, almost four year old little girl really enjoys this game.  She has come back to it periodically for a number of months.  Seems to be mildly educational as well though I haven't taken more than a glance or two.
B00A287PG2|3.0|Long and very much inside baseball. It is an interesting account of a famous firm but didn't give much insight that would help someone else who is a consultant.
B00C2IJJMS|4.0|Got this as it seemed to be a good price.  Don't know about the &#34;Steelbook&#34; thing but the DVD is fine.  Despite all the &#34;abs&#34;, the wife has no interest in this movie at all.  I find it entertaining and the videography and effects interesting.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|My favorite game. Starts easy but slowly gets more challenging. Reminds me of when I first played Mindfield many years ago.
B00422LESO|5.0|This book was hysterical!  I loved it!  A young woman obsessed with Jane Austen, but not too happy in her own life, goes on a three week vacation to Austenland and gets to actually be a player in a world much like that portrayed in Austen's books.  The characters were well developed and the story was very funny and not entirely predictable!  I couldn't put it down and read it within a day or two.  Definitely worth reading!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really love the graphics.  Nice game with good instructions.  Passes the time.  Would love to learn how to level up faster
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|What an awesome CD, the music is totally awesome. And even more fantastic, they are great live also. I love the music on this Cd.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Title says it all, other reviews hit the details, I just wanted to get this movie the 5 stars it deserves.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is fun!!!!!!!!!!! but need to make some levels lil easier and give some more power ups. but its fun nonetheless
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are soooo cute and I love the vector fight and the minions you could buy are awesome the baby minion you could get is so cute you should get this game
0802473156|5.0|A great insight on the various ways we give and receive love.  This book offers insight into love relationships as well as work relationships - to better understand what is meaningful to another and learn to speak their language.  Sequel for teens and children are just as good.  It helps us better know our own self, as well.  Great for individual or group study.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book. Couldn't see some of the secrets coming. Stayed up every night late reading and getting involved in everyone's secret.
B00D5LC4GY|1.0|Was not impressed with this game. So I would notrecommend this game but if you don't want to take what I say try it and see.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I used to play on this app on practically a daily basis. it was awesome. but now everytime I play the game freezes up and I have to reboot my kindle. Would really like the problem to be fixed. Until then. . . Uninstalled.
B00CW665VI|3.0|This is a good love book.  If u r looking for more intimacy this isn't the book.  I did enjoy though.  Isn't always about the sex.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Thank you, Zynga! At last, a Castleville that works! So much cuter, too. So cute, and fun to play<br />DOWNLOAD THIS GAME :-)
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Seems to be well made and would buy again, or as a 'gift' for someone else who needed this.<br /><br />USB 3 speeds achieved using this with my iMac - that is, it seems much faster than usb 2.0.<br /><br />But who knows HOW much faster because there is variability everywhere in the system, especially from the external hard drives which must spinup before files are actually transferred. That being said, all 4 of the units connected to this hub will transfer at higher speeds than 2.0 once EVERYTHING is running at full tilt.<br /><br />My point is be careful how much $$$$ you spend on usb 3.0 stuff because everyone and their brother is saying &#34;data is flying compared to usb 2.0&#34; but we all have our definition of &#34;flying.&#34; Know that in order to achieve faster speeds using 3.0 you must have EVERY COMPONENT usb 3.0 and the horsepower to grab the data that fast - if just one part of your setup is 2.0 or not up to full speed, you'll be wondering why you're not seeing faster transfers.<br /><br />And those who are posting actual speeds - I would take with a grain of salt because there are too many places in a computer system setup where bottlenecks can slow you way down. Take care that you eliminate as many of those FIRST before running out and paying money for usb 3.0
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was extremely excited for the third and last book in the Divergent series, but found myself slightly disappointed with the ending (like with the Hunger Games and Delirium trilogies).  I understand what Veronica Roth had to do with the back and forth of the voice between Tris and Tobias, but it made it hard to stay with the story.  I think hardcore fans like my self will still enjoy the book and knowing the ending, but will feel left down like I was.
1476727651|2.0|If I could only use one word to describe this book it would be ..... PREDICTABLE!!<br /><br />I loved &#34;The Shining&#34;,  I remember reading it and having to stop every once in a while just to catch my breath.  I was really excited about the release of this book, but unfortunately, in my opinion, it just didn't measure up to the first book at all, and for that I am really sorry.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As usual. I'm a happy customer.Thks!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy figuring out how to escape. Can't wait for more levels!  Sometimes it seems easy, but then other times I'm stumped until I figure it out than I'm always like ohhhh :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel makes you think about life and what is really important. Sounds cliche, but it's true. Also, it was a real page-turner.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Excellent 50th Anniversary episode! This was well worth the wait! I think I will be watching this one many more times as I also ordered the 3D Bluray!<br /><br />I do not know what is going on with the pricing on this episode, since I purchased all the 50th anniversary specials when they first showed up on Instant Video, which included the Day of the Doctor episode in HD, a couple of weeks before the Day of the Doctor episode showed, and I only paid the $2.84 plus tax for the Day of the Doctor special.<br /><br />Update: I learned that digital TV episodes have a standardized pricing which is set across the board by the studios, but a studio can set a higher price on an episode in some cases, and apparently, in this case, BBC set a higher price on Day of the Doctor.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I really liked this book.  The shortcomings of the major characters were realistic and the story moved along nicely.  I recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best of all the match games, and it is very addictive. You don't have to spend a fortune to play it because it offers quests  so that you can progress through the levels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The detail was amazing and I like the way Suzanne told the readers what Katniss was thinking. How she cared about others and her plans and thoughts was probley one of the best parts
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting, I play it every day! I love this game! There are so many levels and the power ups are great!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Another great Pixar movie! My kids love Cars and this DVD has been watched many times. If your kids love Hotwheels, they will love Cars!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As engaging as &#34;The Stand&#34;. Not as all encompassing an epic as &#34;The Talisman&#34;, but do not hesitate to buy. Nice to see life works out well for someone in the end :-)
0439023491|5.0|This was my favorite book of the trilogy. The characters are fascinating and the story is compelling. Dystopian fiction at its finest!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The descriptive passages in this book displayed some of the most beautiful, vivid writing I have ever encountered, especially the post-terror attack in the museum, but the plot development sometimes was tedious and implausible.  The sequence involving the trip to Amsterdam was simply not believable.
0545425115|5.0|Never in a million years would I have thought that I would enjoy this book, but I absolutely loved and read it in 2 days. I am so glad that my book club decided to read it.
0679805273|5.0|it was for my son at his graduation (two masters degrees from University of Washington) -- he is a forever Dr. Seuss fan.
1449410243|2.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister. I thought that this book would be a lot funnier than it actually was. Had I actually browsed through it at a book store, I would have never bothered to buy it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addicting I love playing it, is my favorite. The only bad thing in the free version is when you ran out of lives they make you wait for so long to keep playing if you don't want to share in fb or buy more lives. Other than that it is very entertaining
B009AMANH4|4.0|Enjoyed the movie...Missed seeing in the theater. Happy to add to my collection. Great acting, good action fun movie to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game rocks you can get any minion you want.<br />I don't get how you get tokens without buying them<br />now my friend and I love the game.<br /><br />xoxoxoxoxoxo
1250038820|5.0|What a great book.  I ordered two.  One for a friend.  It is so well put together and captures the array of colorful New York characters that go about their lives daily
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is such a great casual game. Takes me back to Tetris on the original game boy. Awesome on a Kindle HD Fire
1250038820|5.0|Everyone's got a story and Brandon is able to pull these stories out of people like no other! Beautiful pictures and stories to go with them!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had wanted this blu-ray collection ever since it was first revealed and released. I had to wait awhile, because like many, I can't afford everything I want. Black Friday and holiday sales is the best way to go sometimes. The movies look gorgeous and there's just an extensive array of special features, the value is just there.<br /><br />I know Alien Resurrection is looked upon very poorly, but I enjoyed it much more than Alien 3 (the sole terrible Fincher movie, but it wasn't his fault). Ron Perlman was great in it, and it's just a fun time. Sure, its arguable some of that may have been unintentional, but the same director made Amelie, The City of Lost Children and Delicatessen. I've watched Aliens more than all the others combined probably. James Cameron was just at the top of his game as he made his way to king of the world. Once you're at the top, you have nowhere to go but down. I don't look upon the first Alien as highly as others, but horror isn't my most favorite of genres.<br /><br />Even if you like only one of these movies, especially if you love the first or the second or both, this set is the PREMIERE version to own.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love all Grisham's books...very entertaining reading.  I always look forward to the next one.  If you've never read Grisham before I suggest starting with 'A Time to Kill.'
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|Best album of the year. Queens of the Stone Age returned from their 5 year hiatus with their strongest album yet. Sounds incredible on vinyl and comes with a mp3 download as well.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|This is a true testament to owning a dog, and it is written in the true style of the Oatmeal comic
B000054BF2|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age is one of the best bands of the late '90's (and currently). This is their 2nd album and all of the songs are great. So happy to own the record now!
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|The game is extremely fun but I have a few beefs with it. First off, is this even the same game that's in the google play store? There are more options in the demo of terraria from the play store than in this &quot;full&quot; version! Second, it lags like crazy!! Almost to the point of it being unplayable!  Very disappointed with this version! Plus it keeps telling me I need to be signed in to the amazon app store to play this game!?!? Get the heck outta here!! I would've rather payed the $5 to get it from the play store than the $2 I payed for this one!!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I have to admit I got stuck for a while, and there are no walkthrough s to help! But I found the last plank, the game is a 5 but it also cost 5 to buy, if you love a great game though it's worth it
B00GO95BUU|1.0|Thanks for the &#34;bend-over&#34; and pay more attitude from Amazon! I shall purchase my next TEN BOOKS from Barnes and Noble!!!
B001YV502C|5.0|Not just a great sci-fi movie, but a great movie, period.<br /><br />With the mega-success of Alfonso Cuaron's latest film, &#34;Gravity&#34;, I suspect a fair number of people will search this out.  There's not a weak link in this film; acting, production design/special effects, script, editing, and (of course) direction.  The visual details are amazing; look at the windows being blown out across the street in the coffee shop bombing scene and the London buses with advertising videoscreens plastered across their sides.  Pink Floyd's pig floating once again over Battersea Power Station brought a smile of recognition to my face.  But at the heart of this spectacular film, a thought provoking screenplay (based on a novel) that will stick with you for years to come.
B005ZBBKHQ|5.0|I don't normally go outside of the Prime realm but took my chance.  This treat came in a couple of weeks ago and I am the happiest person ever.  It arrived just as promised.  All CDs in this set have their own mini case, 2 pockets &#62; 1 for the cd and 1 for the lyrics sleeve.  This is definitely a collection I am happy I purchased and a chance I am glad I took.
B005LAII8K|4.0|With this movie, Bruce Willis has now starred in two of the best time travel sci-fi flicks of all time (the other being &#34;Twelve Monkeys&#34;).  Very entertaining from start to finish, Rian Johnson wrote and directed this smart and visually impressive film.  Unlike so many other time travel movies, &#34;Looper&#34; flat out admits in one fairly humorous scene that thinking about it too much will screw with your brain, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great, as is Jeff Daniels, who has some of the best lines as the crime boss sent back from the future to run things 30 years in his past (&#34;I'm from the future.  You should go to China.&#34;).<br /><br />I reserve five star ratings for sci-fi for the ages like &#34;Children of Men&#34; and &#34;2001&#34;, but this is a very strong 4-4.5 stars; highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this is such a great story that shows that finding love is possible under any situation.  It's my second time reading it and I still find myself engaged in the story, even though I already knew what was going to happen.  For people reading it the trilogy for the first time, ignore all negative comments about this book, and read it with an open mind! It is a story that will stick with you and it is such a great work of literature.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|This is a fun, fun movie.  Had never been a fan of Channing Tatum until seeing this.  Whether it's his natural chemistry with Jonah Hill, the script, the director(s), or something they had on the craft service table during the shoot, he turns in a very likable and funny performance that goofs on his hunky looks... pretty much continuously.  I don't consider this one for the time capsule (like &#34;Animal House&#34; or &#34;MASH&#34;), but it's laugh-out-loud R-rated modern comedy that makes you look forward to the sequel.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|Not good. Did not like. Not sure why it is a best seller. Not so much a follow up to a great novel.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Liked it... Even with Jennifer Aniston in it.. She's still hot.. Could've been better but that's most movies out nowadays........
B000URWYTS|4.0|Very good book. Look inside a complex man's life. Insight in to a famous man's life. A good read for all.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This is an amazing video. The cinematography is just outstanding. The story is a bit weird. If you miss the beginning - you are totally lost. The story of Baby Doll is in multiple layers. The 3 Fight scenes are just amazing. Totally comic book - but so other-worldly.<br />Like I said - the setup of each scene were performed by some master of their craft. The costumes, makeup and set dressing was remarkable.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Great book. Fun story. Caused a great discussion at our book club. A good read for any one. Fast read.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Loved the short-lived series and this movie.<br />Very well written and cast. Just the right amount of humor and craziness.<br />I would have loved to be witness to the filming of the series and the movie.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie is amazing.<br /><br />One of my favorite movies this year (2013) and I watch A LOT of movies.<br /><br />If you liked the first J.J. Abrams Star Trek then buy this!!  Even better.<br /><br />I have a lot of friends that wouldn't watch this because they were never a fan of the older Star Trek movies and shows.  Don't let that be the deciding factor!  Neither was I!  But J.J. is amazing and so are these movies.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is actually the 2nd watch I have had of this model. After less than 1 year - the first watch would not run past midnight. I had to manually set the watch every morning... No big deal, it just bugged me. Amazon to the rescue -- I wrote customer service about this and within 30 minutes I received an email response saying that a new watch, same model, was being shipped to me. All I had to do was print out a UPS shipping label and return the defective watch within 30 days.<br />And Bob's Your Uncle - the new watch arrived, very happy with it. I placed the first watch in the same packaging, slapped the label on it and returned it to Amazon.<br />This watch is simple and sharp looking. I like it for the simplicity and the fact that it is an Auto-winder, no batteries.
0345529057|5.0|Holy smokes!  Seriously wow!<br /><br />Unlike a huge amount of other people, I had never heard of Game of Thrones until the show started.  I'm a strong believer that books are always better so after loving the first two seasons of the show I bought this collection.<br /><br />Hooked.  That's what I am.  Have read the first three books so far and they just get better and better.<br /><br />For those people that have never seen the show or read the books but are thinking about trying them do it!  Just think The Tudors mixed with the epic battles of Lord of the Rings.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the most outstanding series - and movie. One of my best and favorite stories.<br />Brown Coats Rule! The right amount of Humor. Each character is fleshed out and the interaction is great.<br />This short-lived series shows proof that the Fox network does not understand SciFi shows and that there is a crowd of passionate viewers of these quality products.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|Clearly a knock off, printing on discs is blurry but you get what you pay for and can't beat the price!
0736063684|3.0|While this book contains lots about various muscles and muscle groups.  It doesn't really contain much practical information about training.  This is a useful supplement to a training book, but I wouldn't recommend it as a stand-alone instructional book.
0788859544|1.0|Defective upon arrival. I expected it to be a lower quality assuming it was a knock off of some sort for the price but it never moved past the FBI warning screen (ironically).
0743270754|5.0|When I first started this book, I was dismayed to see the amount of attention devoted to Lincoln's rivals. I admit I skimmed over some of the initial material on Seward, Chase, Stanton and Bates. After finishing the book, though, I went back and reread what I had missed, especially those parts related to Seward and Chase. I had come to really care about Seward, and I was thoroughly entertained by the foibles of Chase. Goodwin goes deep into the personal growth, or lack of it, in each of Lincoln's rivals.<br /><br />As for Lincoln himself, I expected him to be impressive, but I didn't expect him to be endearing. Goodwin doesn't talk about his wisdom and humility, but rather shows  these strengths, bringing the reader up close to her subject with many poignant details. Letters that were written but never sent are some of the most revealing.<br /><br />I was surprised to find how much of Lincoln's greatness was appreciated by statesmen, journalists and poets, both before and after he died. I'm now starting to read some of this contemporaneous praise, starting with \\"Six Months in the White House,\\" by Francis Carpenter who painted Lincoln's portrait in the last months of his life. Carpenter is not the fluid, lively writer that Goodwin is, but his veneration and awe goes even deeper than hers.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1582181209 Months White House Abraham Lincoln]]
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|God!! This game is so addictive! I luv this app! I would give 5 stars if you guys lowered the cost to save yourself. 4 stars for now. ;)
B002NN5F7A|4.0|Never saw it before now. Amazing dialog and had me enthralled the whole time. Couldn't believe the ending! Threw me for a loop.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great writing - unexpected twists. It was really different and enjoyable! The setting of this story is something unique and captivating.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoy playing this game...it challenges my powers of observation.<br />I got so caught up in the game that time flies.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I used the spike on my serrated bread knife and it is now super sharp. A nice handy tool to keep in the kitchen or take on a camping trip.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I really enjoyed The Everything Store. I am an Amazon Prime member, Kindle owner, etc. I LOVE Amazon for making my life easy and entertaining. Amazon has changed my Christmas shopping habits forever, I will never enter another Toys R Us store if I can help it, thanks to Amazon. So the best thing about the book, for me, were the parts about the development of the areas that I benefit from, the Prime membership, the two day shipping and the Kindle.  I have immense respect for Jeff Bezos and his commitment to innovation.  Brad Stone needed to tone down the \\"Bezos has a strange laugh\\" characterization...it's just overdone, and possibly some people might not find his laugh strange, it's not an objective fact.  If Bezos had entered and won a national strange laugh contest then Stone could have rightly continued to describe the laugh so often, but to me it got old and lazy.  There was a little too much detail in some areas that led me to some page skipping as the book went on but overall, an amazing portrait of the will and foresight of Bezos' amazing mind.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|One of McCartney's best.  Vibrant, fresh, and energetic. The tunes stay with you once you get used to them.  Impressive how he can make this kind of music at his age.  He obsviouly still loves what he does.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I couldn't agree more what a tragedy that things like what happened in this book were tolerated by anyone!! Thank you
B00GO95BUU|5.0|While I would have purchased this episode anyway, I am extremely disappointed in the \\"screw you\\" pricing for it.  Loyal customers shouldn't be subjected to price gouging.  The five stars are for the fantastic episode, but for the pure greed of the company regarding this episode, I give Amazon 0 stars.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Bought this for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  We noticed the elephant was a little wound up too tight as it would snap at a very fast velocity.  The remedy was to let up on some of the tension by pulling up on the elephant and twisting it s few times to relieve some of the tension.  Problem solved and no longer a hazard, much to my niece's delight.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app its super fun and challenging. It helps pass the time. My kids even love Candy Crush.
0316204366|5.0|If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would.  This book single-handedly changed my entire perspective on what it means to be a so-called underdog.  In reality, as Malcolm Gladwell shows with his wonderful prose and intelligent approach toward his subjects, history is replete with &#34;underdogs&#34; who actually had clear strategic and tactical advantages over their competitors, regardless of the &#34;battlefield&#34; on which they fought.  Gladwell describes military battlefields, political battlefields, business battlefields, sports battlefields, educational battlefields, and other venues in which underdogs won every time, when they seemingly had no chance of winning.<br /><br />Gladwell also explains how the disadvantages the underdogs had were typically those no one would wish on anyone else.  For example, he cites several dyslexics who turned their apparent disadvantages around and made them into strengths.  (David Boies, anyone?)  A dyslexic would not wish that condition on his or her own children or anyone else, but can turn that apparent disadvantage into a powerful weapon.<br /><br />If you have ever felt like an underdog, or have ever been an underdog, you should read this book to feel empowered and emboldened to look at your situation differently.  I was inspired and entertained, in addition to being informed and educated, by this book.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The scenes is the movie were so authentic and the actors were so good at their roles.  Of course in the blu-ray version, you felt like you were actually there!  I give the two disc Blu-ray combo pack my highest rating.
0316055433|3.0|TOO LONG<br /><br />LONG WINDED,GETS BORING VERY SOON.AFTER 15 HOURS OF LISTENING I STARTED GETTING A HEAD -ACHE.<br />I will not re-count the story only convey my impressions.<br /><br />There are some good descriptive passages which denote the author's sensitivity,such as the post-traumatic symptoms after the explosion and the passages of Theo and Boris getting stoned together.<br /><br />However,the story becomes increasingly implausible and long winded,causing you to lose interest.<br />I suppose that if it was a book i was reading as opposed to an AUDIO-BOOK,i would have probably skipped countless pages,such as the detailed descriptions of how to restore old wooden furniture.<br /><br />The characters are often flat,with the exception of the protagonist,Theo.<br /><br />Also,towards the end,when there's supposed to be a DENOUEMENT of the plot,the author goes into a wild,exaggerated and again,implausible imaginings and lays it on a bit thick with all the intertwined criminal gangs that are hard to follow.<br /><br />Often touching,but often absurd,the book was too long.nevertheless,at times enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game they constantly have new updates and there is different  courses so you constantly have some where knew to go. This is so much  better than temple run
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I really like these Will Robie books.  He's a pretty interesting character and I'd like to see him end up on the &#34;big screen.&#34;
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Just so fun very cool game. It's so real like  and much better than last game  One Piece is awesome
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Full of twists and turns and tons of Cory wit and charm and a great cast of characters! Can hardly wait for the next Cory story!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is great it's just like clash of clans but you don't fight so that's lame besides that it's great
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Its the Foo. Nuf said! Good collection of songs.  It really is a good collection of their greatest hits from all years.
0385537131|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's Books and this story is where he started.in his career as an author. Also, I went to school in Miss so I can relate to the locations in the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for kids to pass time! My daughter loves it! There is nothing like seeing a child smile with playing with the minions!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is my new favorite game. There are so many different locations you can play on it. The minions are so adorable.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|I downloaded like 4 different players &amp; this is the only one that did not freeze and actually played both the video &amp; sound. So far it's doing what I want. I'll update after our 12hour trip!
B0089LOG02|3.0|Nice read, not a hard book to read and not a long book.  A bit thought provoking that makes you appreciate your own upbringing.  I felt the end came a bit early in the journey, I felt there was more to tell.  But still worth reading.
1451666179|5.0|I'm highly biased because I relate to Allie so well it's a bit unnerving.  Her new stories are great.  Some are the old faithful style stories that make you laugh so hard you cry, while the last two show some definite growth and reflection.  I'm pretty sure I wish and think of Allie as my best friend, so I'm completely cool with her taking some chapters to a newer, deeper level.  Whether you are just after the pure humor or a Hyperbole and Half fan no matter what the topic, there's something in here for everyone...and also some of her best stories that never get old.  This is the kind of book I pick up when I've had a horrible day or want a good laugh, it's a book I'll always want to read no matter what.  As a professional student, there's not a lot to look forward to at the end of the day except more studying - but this book breaks up the monotony and makes me feel human again.  Thanks Allie!!!!!!
B00GO95BUU|1.0|I've decided I'm going to wait and see if the price goes back down.If they do this for 1 episode...what will the rest be?I've been watching whole seasons on Amazon but may just go back to more DISH if this is going to be the way they go.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Outstanding series and exceptional acting.  Bryan Cranston is especially good.  But all the other actors are equally as good.  I liked Dean Norris (Hank) also. He was as good as Walt.
B002N5N4M6|1.0|It's missing at least 13 episodes from season 3--each disc (3 discs) only has 4 episodes, and the booklet included lists about 8 per disc. Nothing like spending the full amount and getting only half the desired product
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I like horror movies and have watched thousands in my life so far.  Very few in the genre are what I would consider to be well thought out with a good plot and/or story.  Most are not original and present nothing out of the ordinary.  I like them even when most of what I've seen are what I would rank 2 or 3 stars, average and below average.  But, the ones that are done well with effort put into the story and acting, it's worth wading through all the average to find a few gems.  Ethan Hawke is a serious, fine actor and he has written some books, himself, so this gave me an inkling that Sinister might be different.  I liked this a lot.  Good acting and a good story.  I could sense the ending by the first half of the film, but that isn't why I watch and like horror movies.  It's like any other genre...the journey from beginning to end.  And, the journey was interesting; I was not bored for a second and there are a couple of unique spins in the story that I have not seen in other films of this type.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book was a little boring while reading the first 5 chapter but towards the end my eyes were glued to the words! Love it don't know what am I gonna do with my life when I finish mocking jay.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I saw Slash and Myles Kennedy on Conan O'Brien and was so impressed that I looked to see what they had made together and found this.  It had to be kismet.  I purchased this and I must say that I have a cd collection of approximately 2,000 and I have to say this is in my top 10 of all time favorites; maybe even top 5.  Myles has one of the best voices I've ever heard, Slash outdoes even himself in guitar and the songs are my kind of rock and roll.  I've played it 100 times already and will play it another 100 before the year is out and many, many more times in years to come!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is pretty fun,  very additionally,  if you don't complete the objective though you need to wait a while try again.
B0098TL4YU|5.0|awesome cd from the former survivor frontman  while his vocal range isn't quite as good  as it was when he was younger he still delivers a knockout vocal performance the music and band are also awesome don't delay buy this cd today you will be playing this one for a long time
B00C5R8364|4.0|The story is real time as the raid in Nairobi revealed and the admission  of drone war by one of the Texas armchair warriors in an interview confirms. Its fast paced and well researched. A thriller Forsyth to compare well with the Odessa File.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Great album and singers that my husband and I enjoying.  I even got my friend to enjoy it.<br />Cannot wait for their next one.
B005LAIIGW|4.0|This movie was about space accident but the cause, the acting and the directing made it original and much more interesting than others of the same genre.<br />Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's acting were engaging. They made me care for their characters. I was scared when they were in danger. I was relieved when they were safe. Sandra held my attention through the whole 90 minutes.<br />Director Alfonso Cuarón made the picture flow smoothly.<br /><br />The suspense was gripping from the begginning till the end.<br /><br />The Cinematography was beautiful. It showed eye-catching images of the Earth from space.<br /><br />Of course it had logical holes that were bigger than houses. They did annoy me but I still enjoyed the film.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie as of November 22, 2013:<br /><br />Release Date: October 4, 2013<br />Production Budget: $100 million<br />Domestic:  $242,199,000<br />+ Foreign:  $293,600,000<br />= Worldwide:  $535,799,000<br /><br />So, it's popular both in North America and overseas. So far, it took in 435 million dollars more than its production cost. That's a gigantic amount.<br /><br />In short, it's certainly worth watching.<br /><br />P.S.<br />I'm very interested in the survival chance of astronauts in a space accident like this. So, I did a research and found some major problems that made this movie impossible to happen in real life.<br /><br />1. \\"There is no way to go hopping from one space station to another so easily. You can't just look around and see another spacecraft and then get there by simply pointing in the general direction with some soft landing jets and a fire extinguisher.\\" This is quoted from the article named \\"What Does A Real Astronaut Think Of 'Gravity'?\\" by Garrett Reisman, Former NASA Astronaut, posted on Forbes dot com.<br /><br />2. \\"How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) & a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another.\\" This is atweet by  famous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.<br />In other words, if China had a space station orbiting, it was impossible for Sandra to see it because it was out of her view.<br /><br />3. \\"Space jetpacks really do exist! They are called MMUs (Manned Maneuvering Units)... Even so, they are not practical for most missions and were retired almost 30 years ago.<br />They are also not a replacement for a ... spaceship.... Space is big! You can't just backpack around it the way you backpack around Europe. It would be difficult for Kowalsky to retrieve Stone, let alone use his jetpack's nitrogen farts to reach another spacecraft...\\"<br />This is a quote from the article titled \\"20 Scientific Errors in Gravity\\" posted on sparknotes dot com/mindhut/
B00FRMCYQ4|3.0|It gets a star rating of three because I did manage to stay awake through it, and my kids seemed to like it okay, but if you can't even make a movie that is at least comparable to Shrek, Toy Story(any of them) or Cars...you shouldn't make one at all. I found it super disappointing, and if you enjoy the intelligent quick-witted humor in animated movies of the past, this movie will leave you feeling that way too. I really, really tried... I promise, but this film just didn't deliver. The movie is just okay. On a positive note, my kids giggled once or twice and I only paid $12.99 on Amazon Prime so at least I don't feel ripped off :)
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The best of any of the Star Trek movies and I'm a huge fan of the old series, too.  As fantastic as the visuals are, they are only really brought to life because of these absolutely wonderful characters.  Outstanding acting across the board -- the whole team is just great.  But Benedict Cumberbatch is, as usual, exquisite.  Great fun to watch!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like Candy Crush. Although sometimes frustrating it makes me think and gives me great satisfaction when I solve a puzzle.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This is an excellent movie about a great man, who put his past behind him and tried to right the bigotry in Africa. The man I'm referring to is Nelson Mandela, I highly recommend the High Schools should show this movie in class. Maybe everyone will finally understand what living together means.
B002XD8KEU|2.0|Last words in the film:<br />&#34;What's going to happen next?&#34; &#34;I don't know...hahahahaha.&#34;<br /><br />....Well, this was 1998, and it turns out that what happened next was 9/11.  I'm not sure that &#34;turning color&#34; and retreading Beatles songs was quite what happened.  But, well, dear 90's, I agree that that might have been nice.<br /><br />I suppose if you can imagine that getting over the Clinton-Lewinski sex scandal has been the primary thing that happened over the last say 15 years, then you can cheer right along with this movie.  Otherwise, not so very much.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|a masterpiece of American literature, beautifully written, multi-layered meanings, room for interpretation, and suspenseful and entertaining to boot  bravo, Donna Tartt
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Book held my interest the whole time. Loved the way it was narrated. I couldn't put it down. This was the first kindle book I every downloaded and it was excellent.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|What a voice!  I haven't laughed out loud so often reading a book since &#34;Dave Barry Does Japan.&#34;  Charming, sweet, engaging - and my 23-year-old daughter read it immediately on my recommendation and loved it just as much!  Can't wait for the movie.
B0016492BW|5.0|The knights of ni and the rabbit of course. If you have never heard about the rabbit scene got to YouTube and after watching you will buy this movie just to watch  that one scene over and over. The one drawback is you can only get the digital copy from Sony's website as this movie is not yet available on iTunes or Amazon instant video. The Life of Brian & The Meaning of Life are available on iTunes and The Meaning of Life is available on Amazon Instant Video. Why amazon does not have Monty Python & the Holy Grail or The Life of Brian for digital download I do not know but I hope they rectify this problem soon
B008Q00PHY|5.0|all the time all the way in your face type of flick they dont make em like this any more
B000VECAC6|5.0|There is a reason rotten tomatoes gives this movie 96% fresh certified it is Classic British humor and is a great movie to watch.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Really enjoyed this unusual and compelling drama. The storyline is completely original, weaving seamlessly between commentary and narrative. As if the bio-terrorism plot-line wasn't compelling enough, the family histrionics and the edgy sexual complications add extra layers to the whole thing. Very tightly written, a real page-turner. Can't wait for the sequel. Highly recommended.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|Judging by the bibliography and index, BB has excelled himself yet again by producing a wonderful exposé of a period in history, which has such importance to us today. In this instance, his writing is fluid but does not have the customary quantity of wit, possibly just as well because many of the events that took place in 1927 America were not funny at all. In fact, I was very surprised at his frequent - well, I counted 5 occasions -  us of &#34;enchanting&#34;; not a word I associate with BB. But the one liners are still there and as usual, make reading any book of his an absolute joy. I learned a great deal from this book. If only BB had been my history teacher at school.
B00GSE96MA|5.0|YEA!! I got the the 50th show and several of the little specials that I liked. I can hardly wait till BBC releases the mini-episode that &#34;Night of the Doctor&#34; also. You can see it on the Doctor Who site on U-tube as well. Amazon will have all the specials as they are released. Thank you.
B00BRJL9J4|5.0|BLISS HAS DONE IT AGAIN. I HAVE EVERY ALBUM THEY'VE MADE AND HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE. I HOPE THEY PRODUCE IT IN VINYL BECAUSE THEIR ALBUM &#34;NO ONE BUILT THIS MOMENT&#34; IS THE ULTIMATE VINYL IN MY COLLECTION ... NOOOOOTHING SOUNDS CLOSE TO IT NO MATER IF IT'S A 180 GRAM OR 200 GRAM AND A 45RPM THIS IS STILL MY ULTIMATE SOUNDING LP
B00F2NOPFG|1.0|The case is broken. I think the package was not good. I was disappointed because I really wanted this product.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Another formulaic Hollywood action movie...this Star Trek suffers from trite unconvincing dialog, a script that seems unfinished with a cliche message of \\"break the rules just for the heck of it\\", complete lack of logic, bland cliche relationships and characters and routine action scenes.  And oh... how many ways can they possibly make a human look like an alien.  I love the Star Trek franchise but this is a completely idiotic movie and I wish I hadn't rented it.  I had to stop watching this movie after 30 minutes as it completely insulted my sensibilities and intelligence.<br /><br />Note: I wrote this opinion before I noticed this movie had been voted worst of the Star Trek franchise by Trekkies in Aug 2013...q.e.d<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Here are some gems from the article above (Hollywood.com):<br /><br />1. Because The Klingons Have Never Looked Worse...<br />2. Because Qo'NoS is Just an Irradiated Wasteland...<br />3. Because There Is Absolutely No Reason Why Carol Marcus Should Be in the Film Or Why Alice Eve's Character Should Even Be Carol Marcus...<br />4. Because Uhura's a Less Progressive Character in 2013 Than She Was in 1966...<br />5. Because Actually All the Characters Are Reduced to SNL-Parody Versions of the Themselves...<br />6. Because Abrams Felt He Needed a Star Wars-style Canyon chase...<br />7. Because, Um, Why Would a Starfleet Admiral Want to Utilize the Skills of a 300-Year-Old Cryosleeper?...<br />8. Because the Story of an Evil Admiral Betraying the Federation's Values While Pursuing Its Security Has Been Told So Much Better Before...<br />9. Because the Special Effects Are as Ugly as Gagh...<br />10. Because It Just Becomes a Silly \\"Greatest Hits\\" Album of a Movie...<br />11. Because San Francisco Is Destroyed and No One Seems To Care...<br />12. Because There Is a Fake Khan and There Is a Real Khan...
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game!!!! I can't seem to put it down. I have to force myself to put it away and get things done!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love MLP and though it can be frustrating at times be cause of the requirement o f shards and you never have enough.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|So quiet. So cool. So fairly priced.<br /><br />I'm taking a star away from all CPU fans from here to eternity tho -- at least until they start shipping the bloody things with BOTH fans (in all of them, forever). Case manufacturers (often the same people) annoy me with this move of &#34;fan expansion slots!&#34; too, but in this case what you are buying IS the bloody fan!<br /><br />It just annoys the hell out of me.<br /><br />That said, I heard since I bought this they do, in fact, have a model that has both fans -- but I didn't know that . . . .and I do still kinda blame them for that, regardless if I should.<br /><br />So -- my petty peeves aside, this thing is worth the money, get it if you can, don't if you want to overclock. It handles my 8-core just fine so. . .yeah, unless you OC you won't need better, and by that point you'd be better with water cooling anyway. . . .
B000F4LPJ6|2.0|I now have this movie in English. The movie is a great movie. But this copy is a Japanese copy.
1933308087|5.0|Excellent book for any quilt lover.  Jinny Beyer is well known in the quilting community and brings forth a wealth of blocks in this book.  It is well organized by types of blocks and contains transparency grids to help you break down the elements of a block.  That being said, it is a catalog of blocks, with a brief look at how they are constructed, it is NOT a pattern book - do NOT buy it if you are expecting to receive full blown patterns, you will be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun game to pass the time with. I have spent a lot of time on the game with no issues .
0316055433|5.0|fellow readers; I am a book fanatic. I say Run do not Walk to get this book. I sell books, but am keeping this one! held me up for a week, wonderful wonderful writing. such a story, while reading it, i was thinking of the actors I am sure will be picked to be in this movie. character rich, all over the world with issues, art, mystery, sensuous, love story. it has everything. get it now. sak66
B0058UXHHK|5.0|The author came to speak at my school where I teach to talk with our students about how to write a novel. She mentioned this book so I decided to download it, loved every minute of it. In fact couldn't put it down and read it in one night. :)
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's hard to put down once you start building your base and it has nice upgrades as you progress in the game. Some minor setbacks happen sometimes when it crashes and you have to be connected for the game to operate. Good game and you don't have to buy gold stars for basic facilities.
0761172726|5.0|We have five in our family so it works out perfect.  Easy to ready. We like the 15 month feature in case we don't get the calendars switched over right away.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I figured why not.  It is free, and if they try making you pay to play I can always delete the app.<br /><br />Once I started playing however it quickly became an addiction making items to sell, expanding my kingdom, and all around wasting my free time.<br /><br />As more than one reviewer stated, there are wait times involved, and if you wanted to bypass those it could get pricey.  I'm currently just past level 15 and have yet to spend a real penny on my digital items.  I might buy a couple of the .99 cent additions just to show my support.<br /><br />My only gripe would be the heavy Facebook integration.  This can cause some quests to hang until you have the crowns to complete them.<br /><br />Really, such a small gripe for a fun game.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is fun to play and I think it's challenging and different to play also. It's very exciting with every level. Great game.. I love the challenge of getting the different thing unlocked.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ugh! Fabulous book and entire series! Can't wait for the movie to see how someone else interpreted it.<br />I wish the series could go on. I feel like I lived in their world.

B005AVIZ6U|3.0|A predictable Jack Reacher story (let's be honest it is why I read them) with the nice touch that it gives the backdrop as to how Reacher became a nomadic dispenser of justice.  For this latter point alone it is a must for Reacher fans. Still if you're a Reacher fan you're going to read it whatever I say.
B00D7OMNXS|3.0|This was an interesting installment of the Iron Man series of movies, but the general direction of the story was evident early on.  The ending was interesting and promises more movies to follow without an obvious cliffhanger.
