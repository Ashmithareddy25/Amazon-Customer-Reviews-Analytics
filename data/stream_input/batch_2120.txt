B00957T6X6|5.0|The books are a good read they hold your interest.  The story line goes back to Robert's rebellion or in some cases thousands of years.  There are many and more characters and a world to explore.  The power struggles are never ceasing and don't expect to learn what happened to everyone the characters are often surprised by what unfolds as well as the reader.  It's sort of like the Illiad that picks up in the middle of a story and never really ends....is there an odyssey to follow?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much! Hope there's more to come -  Will b  looking for the next \\"chapter\\" for sure
B00821OX98|5.0|This show has good writing and good casting. My husband and I enjoy Sci-Fi shows and have liked this a lot so far and are looking forward to the other seasons.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|The images of that tiger on the boat sharing that small space with a boy as they both bond and trying to survive in the endless ocean is a boring and what seems like a personal art concussion that will keep you looking at your watch wishing you did not go. All this is done in flash back format as the boy now an adult (played with as much energy and charm as a vibrator with a dying battery) by an unknown actor as he gets interviewed by a boring flat and tedious series of interviews conducted by a person who I guarantee you will forget as you exit this mess. Ang Lee did some amazing things, this is not one of them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The ladies in my family think this is great.  They like the fact that they can go to one website, see an idea they like and be taken directly to it without searching.
B003B5M0PO|3.0|Written from the point of view of the horse made it interesting.  It was way too short and did not achieve the depth that i would have preferred.
B008B92U32|4.0|A little imagination and a strong stomach is needed for this app. It's a little tricky getting the faces to fit over the proper setting to get a good fit but the results can be funny.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Book starts out great. I was really hooked. Pretty good writing and a very original concept. Too bad the author had absolutely no idea how to end her story.  I have a friend who said at one point, she threw the book across the room.  Also, many useless characters who we never hear from again, after making them seem integral to the story<br /> i.e. .Neighbor).  I was going to purchase Flynn's other book, until I was near the NON ending of this one.<br />No thank you! This is a $2.99 book value, not $12.99. Save your money and borrow it from the Library, or just skip it.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|A nice way to start an exorcise program for people who haven't been to the gym in a while. Simple to use and can be done in the privacy in your own house.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! I am totally addicted, if you have never been on Pinterest you need to, you will be hooked.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I thought the lead in to the final chapter on this trilogy was great.  I could not wait to read it.  The build up throughout the book itself kept me going feverishly.  It all faded away quickly toward the end.  The ending left much to be desired and the final decision by the &#34;Mockingjay&#34; left me perplexed.  I did not feel that it went along with her character at all, which was the most disappointing part.  I am no writer, so I indulge on the creativity of others.  I think the lack of creativity in the ending did an injustice to the great amount of creativity in the set up.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game has been addicting to me for some reason. I think it's the challenge of collecting and trying to open more games.
B0043RSJ8G|2.0|I thought I would like this based on a previous book by the same author but this book had a much more political tone.  I really didn't enjoy it, but it was engaging enough to get me to the end.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I'm not sure about this. I dont always have internet connection which is needed, so I really have not gotten to use it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i love this app, its awesome, but it does need some more updates, i really think it should have flint and steel. but, its still by far the best app ive ever gotten! thank you mojang!!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app, I'm addicted .I like finding and catching up with people I haven't  seen or talked to in years.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I would recommend it.  Very Good book. Could not put it down.  Can not wait to finish book number three.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'd recommend this book - especially to people in relationships and/or married.  I can't wait to see the movie.  I just ordered &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; by same author.
0765365278|4.0|It's a great book with a good start for a sequel. I am wondering where the sequel is. I would at least like to hear of something on the sequel. I would give the book 5 stars but it's been out for long enough to have gotten some information. Maybe a working title, just something. Is there even going to be a sequel?
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a great game! Just like Super Mario & I love being able to play a game.e so similar on my Kindle! :)
B001XUIBNO|3.0|I just didn't like the incest part... I like thing to turn out well in the end...This didn't ...sad... no hope implied...
B00797MB0O|1.0|This is not entertaining or funny and definitely doesn't tug at your heart strings. If you want to feel uncomfortable for an hour and a half, watch this movie. That is literally the only word to describe this sad excuse for a film. uncomfortable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The new update really changed the game in a useful way.stonecutters nether brick and netherrack this was a game changer
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Once again, HBO proves they are the leader in original programming with the second season of their critically acclaimed Game of Thrones series. Not only is this currently one of the most exciting and well-acted shows on TV, it's one of the best shows in recent memory. It can be a tricky task to translate a book to the small or big screen, but the creators behind GoT have really nailed it; the locations, the costumes, the imagery, the culture...it's all there. Much like Peter Jackson did with the LoTR trilogy, the show runners have picked all the right locations for filming and have made the viewing experience as authentic as possible.<br /><br />Above all, and what makes the show so great, is the performances given by the actors. Each role was cast wonderfully and there aren't any changes, in my opinion, that would make the show better or more watchable. I could try to name a few standouts but honestly the entire cast is undeniably great.<br /><br />There are several changes the show made compared to the original book, but at no point did I feel like it took away from the overall story. If you haven't read it, I won't spoil anything but there's some awesome storylines in this season, including Jon Snow's, Arya's, and Tyrion's.<br /><br />I know it seems like I'm being vague with this review. I could try to pick out a few scenes or moments from this season that stood above the rest but from the opening scene in King's Landing to the unforgettable climax beyond the Wall, this season is great in it's entirety. If you enjoyed the first season, you'll continue to love this one. If you haven't yet started watching this incredible show, do yourself a favor and see what all the hype is about. You won't be disappointed.
1616550414|5.0|This is possibly one of the greatest Zelda collectibles to ever come into existence! I would highly recommend this to any LoZ fan!<br />Excellent quality, and has that awesome new book smell ( you know what I'm talking about ). Awesome level of detail and the art work is astounding 10/10!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the world is beautifully written, true to life occurrences during times of world war two keep your attention. It's hard to put this book down. Another fantastic work by Ken Follett.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is awesome!! Edge of your seat thriller, twists and turns-- it rocks! 5 stars, must watch. Especially if your a zombie fan!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. It easy to search, several reading plans available, reminders each day. Like I said I love it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is funny you have to experience for your self and you will be happy you bought it it is the best series I ever read
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It does not have instructions on it....not sure what the purpose of the game is. I would not suggest buying it
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This book was remarkable.  I've never read a story that flipped completely from black to white and left me rethinking everything.
0441013597|5.0|Back in the '80s, a TV commercial for a bath-water softener named Calgon featured a harassed, stressed-out woman. She says, \\"Calgon, take me away,\\" and is then transported to a bathtub surrounded by a calming, misty forest.<br /><br />When I face stresses I wish to escape, I don't use Calgon. I read The Lord of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien), The Dark Tower series (Stephen King), or Dune. This time I chose Dune.<br /><br />These three writers have created complete alternative worlds in which I can escape. The characters face seemingly unsolvable problems, but they keep on keeping on and they prevail. Luckily, I have the ability to lose myself in a well-told story, so these three, in particular, can \\"take me away.\\"<br /><br />Dune is the story of a feudal society of the future, when humans have spread to many planets. The Atreides House has been given control of Arrakis, a desert planet also known as Dune, which alone supplies \\"spice,\\" a substance that has geriatric qualities and also allows the pilots of the Spacing Guild to navigate from planet to planet. Treachery awaits them, and the Duke Leto Atreides is killed, but his 15-year-old son Paul and his concubine Jessica escape into the desert. There they must face the dangers of the environment, of the natives of the planet, and of the worms, giant (really, really giant) sandworms, who devour everything that they sense.<br /><br />Herbert has included every aspect of his created world in this book--the language patterns, the politics, the mythology, the religion, the life-style, the environment. His treatment of the science of desert ecology is apparently accurate (so I have read). Mysticism and mind-enhancing drugs also enter in, which may be one reason this book was so popular in the late '60s. This world is so clearly delineated that I would recognize it immediately if I ever found myself there.<br /><br />The plot here is intricate and not easily anticipated; the politics are also intricate; the characters are somewhat archetypal, but that is fitting.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, if you have the kind of mind that can suspend disbelief and escape from reality, you should read Dune and at least two of its sequels. If you have not read them already.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so much fun! it helps keep your mind open and fast moving! i play this game everyday!
B00APUTEBG|5.0|I could have given this a lower rating but it was a very good film with lots of action and well written and shot in Europe.
0316227706|3.0|Not spectacular enough to look through more than once or twice. High priced for what we got. Cute pictures though.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The special effects are just excellent and take your breath away in this well told story that has a surprising cast that hold the whole thing together tightly. This is a great Denzel movie!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Everyone is beautiful and there's always a resolution at the end. It's typical Hollywood but, having said that, it's a good story--not a great story--but good. The in-air flight event is exciting. I know I'll always keep my seat belt fastened from now on! Denzel Washington's persona has an annoying habit of moving his tongue to the side of his mouth. I realize this is supposed to represent nerves and guilt, but after a while, it becomes distracting. Other than that, he is very believable as a commercial airline pilot who is highly trained and knows his aircraft. If only he were sober.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Another great Bond film with a new eye on the man and his work and his age. Great action and strong story. Great cast.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|This was a great book about life and death and how you and only you make decisions for yourself and others can influence you but in the end it is all down to you.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had me giggling from the beginning. I've read the Slammed series and knew this was an author I was going to have to continue to follow.<br /><br />This book headed in a direction I didn't expect it to go. It was so well written and you could tell Colleen Hoover put some thought into this book. I felt happiness, sadness, anger, and whatever other emotion you can muster up. AMAZING BOOK!<br /><br />I can't wait for her future books!
B00846F1YW|4.0|I'd rate it as a solid 3 &amp; 1/2 stars. I haven't had any issues with it. It's easy enough to not completely annoy me, but challenging enough not to bore me in the first five minutes. It's just not exciting enough to rate a solid four or five. But all in all, a decent hidden object game that isn't over in five minutes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Still love this game, only you can't cheat like when you play with real cards.  Still addicting though.  Love it!
B007R41E8O|1.0|I have been trying for 3 days to download this game. Still no luck. Waste of time and money, I have had this problem with other Alawar games.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I enjoyed the film, and I enjoyed the soundtrack. Now that I own it, i'll have to look into getting more Daft Punk. This OST makes for an epic commute to work.
B00AGKHEUI|1.0|Nice photos.  Cool booklet.  Far out picture discs.  The original album now has more punch as in the LOUDNESS WARS.  So hold on to the old vinyl/1990 CD copies for the easy on the ears vocals and production.  \\"Silver Springs\\" finds its rightful place at the end of the album where it belongs after \\"Gold Dust Woman\\"..........The live 2nd disc is raw less polished than \\"The Dance\\" which is what live albums are supposed to be.  Good sound for its time.  Rough versions of \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" kick it up into high gear. By itself worth the purchase..........The 3rd disc has lots of demos and alternate takes that are different than the original versions.  This is a major improvement from the 2004 double release where the 2nd CD almost sounded the same.  Now here's the bad part.  The CD's have to slide out from tight cardboard sleeves causing immediate scratches, if they are already not scratched to begin with.  CD cover itself folds out and back in like an old vinyl double album.  There's no outer sliding plastic cover to protect the CD cover when its closed  which will get beat up pretty quick.  What should have been a 4 Star release drops to a 1 Star because of quality of the product. Ridiculous!
B00621EG6K|4.0|Glad I found this on-line. Great series!! Thought I'd missed these episodes and wouldn't see how the series ended. Thanks!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My brother has this game on his I touch for a long time and I love it when it came out on kindle fire I had to get it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I reread this book in anticipation of the movie coming out.  It's not anything that makes you think and that's exactly what I was looking for!
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|I am not a SciFic fan, but a friend recommended Stargate Universe.<br /><br />The cast is excellent and all actors are well suited for the role each play.<br /><br />Each segment gets better and I am drawn back like a magnet to follow the lives of the actors.<br /><br />I am continuing to enjoy Season 1. Thanks ~
B00821PCJS|5.0|Interesting plot and characters.  You get both action and excitement plus character development which is great as some shows lack one or the other.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Enjoyed the whole set up of this movie. Turned out a little different than expected. Loved the acquences and the enviroment that was placed fit quite nice.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great show can't wait for season 5 to be free on video on demand. Love Jack! Love the story lines.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Not the best &#34;take me out of reality&#34; type film but this one was witty. Enjoyed most of it but a little long actually getting into the plot of the film. And sort of ended dry.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I liked reading this book.  I was always surprised every time I finished a chapter.  I could never figure out what was going to happen next.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|In asuptions that this movie was going to be a laugh at least 3/4 of the whole movie really let me down, being that the same poeple that produced &#34;Familt Guy&#34;, was the pretty much the same in this movie. I'm guessing, where I am not a drug user and I am happly married, I just could not find much humor as I thought. Still, all in all, there were some scenes, like the fight scene between the main character and Ted, that was a stomach buster.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|All I wanted is for the series to be finished. Plot became pointless, Katniss became more insane, insecure and confused. More people died. Though Katniss feels contempt enough to kill a president for killing children she approves the next hunger games.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i flet like it was written by an eighth grader. Got soooo tired of having to read the same ole, same ole, over and over again sex scenes by  the second book i had every move christian was going to make memorized. only reason i finished was just to see what happened, so i woud skip the stupid repeptitive scenes. these books were a waste of my time and money.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read Gone Girl for my book club, and so glad I did! While I found it a bit slow at the beginning, the detail helped build the very complex (and twisted!) characters and I was captivated by part 2.<br /><br />It was an easy read and I can't wait to hear other points of view from my book club!
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I was looking for a product to protect my Kindle Fire , and this one fits the bill perfectly.<br />A very study exterior , with a super soft interior , this product is both functional and attractive.<br />As there are many versions , keep in mind that this one only fits the 7\\" HD Kindle Fire
B004I2K4DY|5.0|What a great performance.  Wonderful to see the old London cast and new cast sing together.  Such a moving rendition.
B002KF2HWM|5.0|Excellent movie that should be on any SCI-FI fans list of 'must see' movies.  I'm a fan of Willis, but he did better than usual in this movie.  The plot is well reasoned, and the acting is exceptional.  The cinematography is excellent, and the scenes are all well designed and evocative.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|No directions for anything.Good thing I know how to play bingo. Then what do you do with the game if you run out of money to buy cards?I deleted it.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|the review is about the fifth season of merlin - some potential spoilers but i'm not revealing any major story.<br /><br />i watched this last season of merlin more out of habit than a true desire to see the show.  there are fewer lighter moments and the moments between arthur and merlin, for the most part, seemed more contrived than previous seasons.  the first few episodes were OK but not as great as previous seasons where i found myself looking forward to the next episode.  the middle of the season where the storyline shifted to gwen made the episodes more interesting.  the last two episodes of the series are really good and tie up the show.  however, the last 2-3 minutes of the last episode ruined the entire series.<br /><br />that being said, i'm still planning on buying the dvd and completing my collection.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved these books!!! Can't wait to see the movies! I was not sure what to expect for the ending of this book but very good
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|A great look at a legendary studio, the death of analog and the power of people making music together.  Just don't give up making music, Dave!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely fun and addictive I just can't stop playing on it. It's child friendly and I would recommend it to anyone at any age. It's free so you can't lose, at least give it a go and you won't regret it. Enjoy!
B00A757EFW|3.0|The game is just like I remember from when I was a kid.  The controls are a little hard to get used to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this<br />game! Its so fun collecting  coins to buy new avatars  for fun. Five stars!!!!! I recomnd this game to any one who wants to try a different version of temple run. Hope u like it!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|After reading all the reviews about this book, I was disappointed in the ending.  I really thought this book was not all that good considering the details leading up to the end.  He stayed with this nut!  My book club members felt the same.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy download. The large buttons are awesome for big fingers. Can't beat the price. A must have for all kindle owners.
0441018866|4.0|A complete sci-fi story!  Alastair Reynolds has developed a great storyline in House Of Suns.  A line of clones is maintained over millions of years... the ORIGINAL clones!  This &#34;Gentian&#34; line has seen and done a lot over the eons.  But somebody, or something, is now targeting them for termination.<br /><br />Are your perspectives on life different when you live for 6 million years?<br /><br />&#34;That'll teach you.&#34;<br />&#34;Teach me what?&#34;<br />&#34;Never put off until the next million years what you can do during this million&#34; (p. 399).<br /><br />&#34;It is not the span of time that counts, but what you do with it&#34; (p. 491).<br /><br />Sound familiar?  A good book with unique twists.  Reminds me a lot of Iain M Banks.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|i found this book a little confusing and slow at the start but it explains itself as you keep reading it, you also get hooked in eventually you just have to keep with it. Not the best book i have read (i like being pulled in straight away) but still a good read.
0316044695|3.0|On one hand, I like very much the last one third of this story. On the other hand, I was shocked by the Hollywood aspect of this story. I have a hard time to believe in most of it. Unless, these Seals were built as Arnold in Terminator this cannot be true. By Eyewitness account - I expected less BS but more on how this SNAFU was possible.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, not only because I am a massive fan, but because you really get to know what each of the boys' past was and what they hope to accomplish in the future. Also, what they all felt like during the X-Factor.
030746363X|5.0|I picked up the 4 Hour Body after hearing an interview with Tim Ferris on NPR's City Arts and Lectures.  The ideas of minimum effective dose, personal experimentation, and less is more combined with results is really enjoyable.  This book is chock full of interesting tidbits with minimal BS.  Tim is very up front about what has and has not worked for him, and provides information from other readers with their results.<br /><br />His thoughts on Slow Carb are based on sound information and personal experience.  He also includes suggestions for how to do it as a vegetarian, and additional supplements that would be beneficial.  He advocates trying it yourself and seeing your own results.  In order to actually do this, it is important to follow his advice to do before and after measurements.  The research of Dr. Weston Price and Gary Taubes (author of \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\") are sources of additional information regarding diet and exercise (more emphasis on diet).<br /><br />As a father of 2 children, the thought of being able to see results with less time is very appealing to me.  Thanks, Tim, for your willingness to perform personal experimentation and to share your results.  It's a refreshing antidote to outdated and incorrect information coupled with pragmatism.  This book is a very enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to alter their perceptions regarding diet and exercise.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|OMG SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I love my little ponies and this game is perfect for me.<br />When I first saw this game I was like OMG!OMG!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Was looking at the SCHF9 for a while but it's been out of stock for about 4-5 months now so I checked some other reviews and settled on this knife.<br /><br />Fits in your hand like it was made to be there. I have XL-XXL hands (glove sizes) and this knife is a comfortable addition to my ruck.<br />The sheath is decent for the price of the knife. If you dont have some paracord to secure the sheath to your thight, it may be a little difficult to remove the knife.<br />Other than that its bad ass.

0385366752|5.0|This story has as many twists and turns as  Lombard Street  in San Francisco.<br /><br />Nick and Amy Dunn were the golden couple;  the couple everyone wanted to know, but after losing both of their jobs in New York the marriage started to wane.  Nick finds out that his mother dies which prompts them to move to Missouri to run the family bar.  To Nick's surprise Amy disappears and the investigation uncovers all kinds of secrets that point to Nick as the abductor and killer.<br /><br />Written from Nick and Amy's points of view this is a sociopathic tale revealed right before your eyes.  This is an incredible read and your emotions will be ripped apart and thrown in your face.  A must read for those who like a disturbing mystery.
B00008Z0EX|5.0|I love Madonna since the begining, and this album made me love her even more, I think it's a very honest and critical album, each song has a message, a message to love what is worth in life to hold on to really important things and a message to reject all the wrong in the world that people usually worship. To promote the album Madonna went on tour that year with the Reinvention World Tour which to my point of view was dedicated to all her fans, it was an special album with an special tour, both of them were very intimate.<br />I think the album was underrated because of the political message in the leading song, but if you give it a chance you'll see the greatness of this work.
B000127LW2|4.0|Esta es una edición sencilla, no tiene bonus relevantes y carece del audio del doblaje en español original. Seguramente hay por ahí alguna edición que tenga ese audio, si alguien lo sabe se los encargo. Por lo demas la serie es extraordinaria, la simple idea de una mujer capitana es buenísima.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I played this game with my family in Germany and we all loved it.I never won though. It was the best board game i have ever played.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie is a very cute and witty kid movie. I would recommend it to all ages and families. But not as witty as a Shrek or Toy Story.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Since I believe that our consciousness resides outside the physical body and continues to exist after our body dies, Eben Alexander's book was believable to me, and also astounding.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I loved the mo9vie, I have seen the play and the movie held me in fact my granddaughter is in choir at school and she watched it so much her mother bought her the dvd and she can now sing  most of the songs
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game although I cnt move the buckets when I try to get her food :-/ but overall I rate it a 5/5 its so neat and interesting
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I've only read a third of the book and it was a struggle. Maybe it becomes better in latter chapters, but I am seriously considering to not waste my time with it anymore.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Why don't you have the newest update available? Very unhappy with amazon appstore right now.  I will be recommending  google play store in the future.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was definitely a good read - different than anything I've read before. It involves fantasy, fiction, and some true vintage photos that really bring the story to life.  Can't wait for the second book to come out!!
B00821OX98|4.0|Once I gave a try I became fasinated with the outcome. It started slow but got better. I look forward to next season.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|A friend gave this movie to me as a gift.<br />Great action story that can be watched repeated and still be interesting.
B008NW67E0|2.0|This album would be worth all the accolades if it would lead listeners to real bluegrass music. Check out the Dillard's Wheatstraw Suite. It puts this album to shame.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Amazing story line that kept my interest throughout the entire movie.<br />I have shared this movie with others interested in that time period.
B002SAS26E|5.0|My wife and I recently have gotten into playing a lot of 2-player board/card games when the kids go to sleep.<br /><br />We have about 10 games that are great for 2 players, but Jaipur is currently our go to game and it is a game that both my wife and I really enjoy (my wife isn't much of a gamer, but she loves this one).<br /><br />I won't go through the rules because they are very simple and the rules can be found online, but what really makes this game shine is the camels.  The camels bring an awesome strategy element to the game...If I take all of the camels on this turn, that will set me up for a big trade down the road if needed, but it's also going to flip up X number of cards in the market that my opponent gets first dibs at, etc.<br /><br />The cards are really nice, the game comes in a small box that would be easy for travel, and the pog-like pieces are what you would expect, good quality and they get the job done.<br /><br />Set-up for the game is really not that bad, with 2 people sorting and laying out the tokens it takes just a couple minutes per round, and when you are done it makes it easier to just group everything by color as you put it back in the box.<br /><br />If you enjoy Jaipur, you might also enjoy these games as well:<br /><br />-Morels<br />-Battle Line<br />-Court of the Medici<br />-Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small<br />-Lost Cities<br />-Hive<br />-Finca<br />-Biblios<br />-Guillotine<br />-Jambo<br />-Archaeology the card game<br />-Love Letter<br />-Mr. Jack Pocket<br />-Dominion<br />-Hey That's My Penguin<br />-Stomple<br />-Blokus Duo
B005FISBTO|4.0|It was great.  All that you would expect from Dexter and more. Some odd things with Debra, and a shocking ending.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved every moment of this book. Extremely well written, I did not want to put it down. I can only hope the movie does it justice.
B007N85POS|4.0|Nothing really to complain about it but one thing I noticed is that the regular (ad free) version has a bigger zoom in gameplay so things are bigger. Also, for me it's kinda hard to tell between normal and &quot;high definition&quot; so really I'd kinda prefer the (ad free) one if you want things to be a lot bigger during gameplay but I have both and really really care all that much for which one I use.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|But still a great read.  Love the characters.  Good story line - can't wait for the third one to come out!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to navigate. Even my small city was easy to find. Extremely accurate information. Love the up to the minute radar.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought that it was the best series ever it had so much action and fun its a must have
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game, some dragons you have to buy with gems, and gems cost real money, but u can breed them for free anyways, i jave no complaints, i love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I highly recommend for anyone who want their kids to have a fin chore....or see if they can handle a pet :)
B008OOYALE|1.0|boring and hard to expand, u need some stupid  map and u have to buy gold or else you have no cool dragons,.80% of the dragons u have to buy with gold, and gold costs real money, oh, and all the dragons look really stupid, ger Dragonvale, my favorite game, it's really free, unlike dragon story.
140123755X|3.0|I was primed to enjoy this book - the first time I heard somebody mention it and describe the premise, I looked it up and ordered it.  Fairy tale characters in the modern world - yes, please!  Would it be like [[ASIN:0694525499 American Gods]] mixed with Sandman but with Hansel and Gretel?  Would it be a graphic novel style version of a Jasper Fforde novel, but with more adult themes?  I couldn't wait for it to arrive.<br /><br />And it was kind of like those things . . . kind of.  But not as awesome as I'd hoped.  This is a book that is hard for me to rare because my expectations were so high.  I enjoyed this book, but I enjoyed the concept a lot more than the reality.<br /><br />The characters are the thrill of the book and Willingham and co. do a great job of bringing them to life.  The fun of spotting beloved characters is mixed with the challenge of identifying lesser-known ones.  In picking what I predict will be the mains, Willingham has made solid choices.  I can see building a longer narrative around them.<br /><br />The art . . . well, I am so-so on the art in this book.  It went from \\"quite nice\\" to \\"workmanlike.\\"  There was nothing terrible, but nothing thrilling.  Some of the other covers for this series that I've seen are gorgeous, so I'm hoping I'll find more to like as the series progresses.<br /><br />The story is where I found myself more disappointed than fulfilled.  I realize that this book is setting up the world and characters for us.  I expected more than the half-baked crime plotline presented here.  As the book wound up, I definitely had a \\"is that all there is?\\" moment, something I wasn't expecting with a series as hyped as this one.  I actually enjoyed the bonus material about Bigby more than the main story, a concerning sign.  I have the next two volumes, so I'll continue to read.  I want to see what happens with Bigby, Snow White, and Rose - as well as the characters like Bluebeard.  I just hope that the main thrill of the series doesn't turn out to be turning the page and seeing a familiar character in a new setting.turn out to be turning the page and seeing a familiar character in a new setting.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Addictive, really. How ironic. This version of Sherlock Holmes is fresh, amusing and immensely entertaining. &#34;Watson&#34; is his perfect foil, but with a new twist (and it's not just that she's a woman). I sat down and caught up on the 6 or 7 episodes that I had missed this season, all over 2 days. And still couldn't get enough. My hands-down new favorite TV show, in a very long time.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I like this cable. It attaches easily and I have a Poetic cover installed. It is a one way attachment. Look closely at your Nexus 10 and you'll see that the attachment magnets are keyed; there is a rounded corner. This cable has matching magnets. Mine only attaches one way. I feel the magnetic attachment is far superior to the clamping action of the USB. My USB attachment feels sloppy. I can't see how it can go wrong. Now my USB connection can be saved for when it's necessary. Got a Nexus 10? Get one of these!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I can honestly say of all the apps I have this one is used the most when it comes to being away from home. All the outside noises just go away.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|from the moment I began reading I was hooked!  Such a great story!  I want more!!!  You will fall in love with the bad boy!!!
1416550550|4.0|\\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is a casual good read! One of those books you might pick up for a long plane ride or a lazy day at the beach. You'll become attached to the characters in such a way that when your plane lands you'll have to look around before you realize you're in Miami sitting next to your husband. A tale of women's lives interwoven in mystery; filled with love, devotion, loyalty and betrayal.<br /><br />If you're not getting on a plane, put on a pot of tea and snuggle up on the couch on a rainy day for this one! Let your willing sense of disbelief take charge and lose yourself for a while in Kate Morton's \\"Forgotten Garden.\\" A great escape for days when you want to read something light and entertaining. Enough mystery to keep you captivated, not too complex where you have to think too much. I enjoyed it.
B0011Z76RS|5.0|This album is definitely the best LinkinPark album! It's before they went more electronic rather than good rock.  And highly recommend purchasing it- if you haven't already!
1401322786|5.0|I have read almost all of his books.  I know it is good when I keep thinking about the outcome long after I have finished it.  This is what happened to me with this book
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was absolutely the BEST book I ever read.  Dr. Alexander is right, reading this book will change your life!!!!
B003H8WGZ4|5.0|I've always been a fan of Toto, even thru all the lineup changes, other than Lukather.  This is an awesome CD to have if you're a fan because it not only carries the great tunes of the past, it also has four new songs at the time recorded with a new vocalist.  Definitely one to have for your music collection.
B005GIS2UQ|1.0|this movie is not funny, it's a train wreck, the only reason to watch this is one scene, and thats Natalie Portman in her bra and panties diving into a lake, thats the only 5 seconds of the movie worth watching
B000IB0DC6|5.0|For me it points to the dilemma faced by humans; perhaps it  would have been better not to have been born.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addictive and a fun way to pass time while you wait.Much more action than the first and a lot harder to master, but very easy to get the hang of.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved every minute of this season! The characters are amazing and so interesting. Acting is superb!  I would recommend this.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I thought they had run zombie s*** into the ground.....I was wrong.  Finally somebody baked the zombie cake just right...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer:  Classic Grisham.  Could not put the book down from cover to cover.  I am waiting for his next release!
140130916X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, so naturally I was inclined to buy the book. A great price and was shipped the same night I placed the order. When I received the book it was sealed with a waterproof cover and there was a courtesy thank you note attached. Super professional and fast, can not wait to start reading!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|While it might be easy to dismiss some reports of near death experiences considering the author might have a suspect background or reason to make up a story to make money on the book, this book does not seem to fit that situation. Further, while other near death experiences seem to be dismissed by explanations that they could possibly have been mistaken for a dream, or hallucination, those clearly are not reasonable explanations for what happened to this gentleman either given the evidence. Quite the contrary, this man clearly decided that while his well built reputation might be tarnished by those who think all such experiences are only silliness, his decision was to press ahead with the story, and the book. His motive seems to be that he hopes to get the attention of folks like his former self who otherwise dismiss all references to God and an afterlife as fodder for simple minded people. Read this book with an open mind, it may change your opinions.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm a Michael Connelly fan.  I love everything he writes.  One of my favorite authors.  He is a very engaging author.
B004R1Q296|5.0|I found it very informative and well written. Will recommend it to my reading friends.<br />What more can I say?
B003XVYLDU|3.0|It bounced off the walls a bit going from one subject area to the other.  A bit hard to follow at times.
B002BVXYQS|5.0|The instrumentation of the main disc is great, the bonus disc is good as well.  I especially liked the extended intro of &#34;I Will&#34; and &#34;Fog (Again).&#34;  I have not yet looked at the dvd, but I did like the map-poster thing.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I finally understand World War I.  Excellent story in the middle of fascinating history.  What could be better?  I can hardly wait for book two.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Very sad but interesting<br /> I really enjoyed reading it , it told a lot of facts and it was cool
1401235417|5.0|Love this new Batman story ...<br />The new  DC 52 books are good going in different directions<br />waiting for Vol 2 ....
B008RYN44U|5.0|Love the latest & greatest album from No Doubt! It's so good to hear them together...music goes to another level when they perform. Every song is new and fresh....I never tire of hearing Gwen Stefani's voice....somehow they keep it hot and young. I ordered the album when it was released and it arrived right away...in a matter of days. It's been in my cd player ever since! Looking forward to their next project already. My favorite song is Gravity.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Great ensemble cast and writing on this show! Love it! I appreciate the evolution of history played out on this show.
B000002AGN|5.0|very happy with my purchase the cd arrived on time great quality and an overall pleasent experience. will buy fro them again. yipppppppppppeeeeeeeeee !
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I played a few times, and it was great until it stopped working on my kindle fire. I wish I could play it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Considering the issues surrounding the need for mental health care as well as the concerns regarding the exposure to violence by our young people, this book riveted with the personal and family struggles surrounding these issues.
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|Brilliantly written book from Joe Simpson. His descriptive form for telling a story really transport you to the mountain with him
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I know that I have read a &#34;youth&#34; book by the short, stilting sentences and sparse descriptions. I certainly like the concept, though, because it seems to cut close to the grain in the sense that people are under constant surveillance these days. It is reminiscent of George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; in that Panem resembles the divisions he introduced. Also, I saw a correlation between the TV screens in Orwell's book and Collins' technological advancement of a few.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Such a great show - I enjoy historical fiction, so this is right up my alley.  Great characters, great costumes, they really touch on all the issues of the time and the story lines keep me coming back.  I'm always anxious to watch the next episode.  Highly recommended!
B0050OMJIW|4.0|I was really introduced to this book by reading John van der Ruit's &#34;Spud&#34; novel. It was very funny in places and, as one who served in the Air Force, much of the scenarios showed that the author understood the context well! I will admit that I started to lose interest after a while as the author tends to spend whole chapters on individuals; some of them grabbed me and others were rather boring. On the whole, an entertaining read that explores human fickleness, the rigidness of societal structures and the absurdity of war.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Easy to play and still challenging.  Good story line keeps the player interested, graphics are OK, nice twist to put the player underwater.  Good balance of challenging, but not so difficult you are forced to look up the answers.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 lived up to the high expectations set by Season 1. At times it was even better and I sat up way too late because  I just had to see one more episode!  I definitely recommend it.
B00BECZPI0|1.0|I watched S3E1 today and the sound only came out the right speaker of my home theater system. It sounded horrible. I was disappointed.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|If you are, or someone you know, is a GG fan, this is an excellent product. We love GG so it's definitely a 5 star.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|My last wristwatch was rather heavy and uncomfortable. With the Skagen I'm not even aware it is on my wrist.  A nice watch for a reasonable price.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great book. I have probably 99% of John Grisham's books and they are all page-turners. I love his sense of humor when he describes different characters. I would recommend to anyone who likes legal thrillers.
6303477259|5.0|...this should be it. I have both the vhs and dvd, and both are amazing. The dvd in 5.1 is outstanding and the picture has been restored beutifully.  The setlist is practically a greatest hits package performed masterfully. This is a must have for any pink floyd fan, old or new.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Although the theme of this book was wonderful, I did not understand much of the scientific terms and language that was used. It seemed he was writing a text book instead of telling people the wonders of God's heaven.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|At first it's great just like on your computer, but after the first ten posts it turns blue and won't show pictures and things. I used to have this app for my kindle fire, but I uninstalled it and I go online to check on my kindle to check my Facebook, and it works perfectly.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was so emotional through the whole thing. This book totally hit home with me! Thank you for such a good book.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|Sometimes you may just want to watch a no brainer escape into another time or someone else's life.  This takes care of that desire.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Finely constructed script plus great acting plus compelling cinematography makes for an outstanding film.  Our whole family watched it and there wasn't a dry eye in the house by the end of the movie.  The contrast between the two geographical and cultural regions of England, along with the &#34;Pride and Prejudice-like&#34; story lines, characters and ironies, was surprisingly gripping.<br /><br />Definitely worthy a multiple viewings.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Awesome book, the recipes are interesting and the writing phenomenal...Still don't know how he makes his life seem so go with the flow while running ultras...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very good read. The book was quite imaginative, had old photos, and old writing samples. I used to have boxes of old photos, bibles, correspondence from my husband's estate sale business. I know what it is to look at old things and imagine the lives they recorded. This is a wonderful read with a hopeful ending. You must read it. Then get out your roller skates and skate around like a peculiar child, even if you aren't usually one.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I was really impressed with this. We all know the story, but the details are excellent<br /> Totally recommend it! Read it now.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I have completed the whole download just the sanple but as soon as I get to a cyber cafe I willcomplete the other download.  But what I've read in the sample makes memore interested in completing the rest of the book.  I;m in the process of getting wi fi in my home to be ableto do more with my Kindle fire,
B0094K1K42|2.0|So many problems, and too few solutions make this movie tedious and difficult to enjoy. I liked the actors, who performed admirably. But I cringed and flinched watching the outrageous and adolescent behavior exhibited by the main character especially.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|When I go to an areaa where I can acccess it way from home its great,  I'm new to maneuvering with my Kindle but I'm sureitwill work better whenI get linked to wi fi from home.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|Charlie gets divorced from Elaine and, suddenly free of her ex-husband's presence, Elaine begins writing about Charlie in her weekly column titled \\"Bastard\\" published in a national newspaper. And, much to Charlie's horror, she is writing about everything - his bad habits, his sexual performance, his parenting faux pas - everything she hated about him and their marriage. And now everyone can read about it!<br /><br />Nick Hornby's struck upon an interesting idea for a story but it quickly becomes clear why this became a short story and not a novel - besides the setup, nothing much happens. Charlie is publicly shamed for being an inattentive lover, a less-than-brilliant father, and a philanderer, but otherwise the concept doesn't advance much beyond the column being published each week and Charlie being embarrassed every time. And then it ends rather abruptly.<br /><br />I thought the scene where Charlie and Helena, the victim of a competing column written by a vengeful husband called \\"Bitch\\", awkwardly get together in a hotel room one afternoon was funny, and the story is amusing enough for the most part. But it's not up there with Hornby's better short story efforts like the brilliant \\"Otherwise Pandemonium\\" and \\"Not a Star\\".
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This a terrible idea of my music and the next day I am not sure if it is the next generation to be a good thing.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I dislike the foul language, There is no way to remove it from my ipad,, Idon't believe it is on my Kindle.. that should be enough reasons.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|The problem is that this is not a novel -- it is a history book.  Of the Presidents and how they handled their time in office.  It is a VERY good, well written book.  My problem is finishing it.  It is not a pick up and read from front to back book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm hooked.  Brilliantly written and acted.  You will fall in love with the characters.  Maggie Smilth steals the show everytime she walks into a scene.  I love her!
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Stable and functional ValueRam does the job necessary.  Drives the NAS it has been installed in very well (Synology Diskstation 1513+)
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I have used LastPass for two years now, and generally, it is a good password manager.  It does what is advertized.  I fear it is becoming a marketing platform, though, as I regularly receive upgrade notices, even though I am a subscriber to the premium verson with annual fees, and it also has been pushing its credit monitoring service.  Much more of this and I will be looking elsewhere.<br /><br />The good:  It works across all our home and business systems, while its mobile versions require a bit of a learning curve mastery.  I also senses when you change a password, prompting you to save the new version, which is quite helpful as my banking and vendors have been upgrading<br /><br />The not so good, or mysterious:  I have seen somewhere that this program can be used to open secured programs on a client's system, but I have not been able to find it.  I use a lot of passworded programs and would like to store those access passworded programs through the same program as I access my online sites.<br /><br />The bad:  Not much, really.  But when a new password or site is saved, you must make sure to go into the &#34;vault&#34; and adjust the name of the site, which would simply be an URL if you don't, and then make sure the targeted web address is modified carefully to go to a &#34;log-in&#34; screen, which does not happen automatically.  For example, banks and some other vendors make you go through hoops to get to the log-in, for security purposes, which LastPass appears to be unequipped to work through.  There is an option to create automatic fill information, which I use for a credit card, but I have not made the mental leap to these log-in squences to make it work.  And, if I had to go through multiple fill-ins from various files, I might just skip the LastPass program entirely and do it from memory.<br /><br />A good program, with some kinks.<br /><br />D
B0093LINVK|1.0|The chassis and aesthetics are perfect.  The feature set is pricey for its limitation but you are buying a bit of name brand.  USB2 and not USB3 was a large disappointment but I knew this going in.  The options for compatible wireless NICs are small, and nothing in the 450Mb wireless -n category yet.  Intel wireless as a general statement has proven to be a bit disappointing as well.<br /><br />This unit makes a perfect HTPC mounted behind a flat panel in my view, and that is its current assignment.  Streaming HD video is perhaps at a 90% success rate with occasional difficult more likely caused by WLAN interference and the Netgear router I have.<br /><br />UPDATE: 6/29/15 So after moderate use from the original purchase date of December 29, 2012 the device is dead. The support from Intel since time of purchase has not simply been substandard. BIOS updates that break more features than they fix. Not true support of linux based operating systems (contrary to their claims) - but it has been so bad that I now try hard to avoid Intel products both personally and as a buyer profressionally. This is a marked change as they were once the brand of choice.<br /><br />It won't be easy to find hardware devoid of an Intel product, but I sure will try hard to source that. An absolute shame what has become this once premier company and their product line.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I guess this book turns some people on but it's not for me! It makes me wonder about the author. It's sadistic to say the least!<br />I really didn't know what it was about until I started reading it. The only reason I ordered it was because of one of the reviews<br />said it was a great book and she gave it a high rating.  I guess she was one of those who got turned on while reading it. To tell you the truth I'd really like to get my money back because it's nothing but trash! I'll stick to reading my Nora Roberts books!
0316227706|5.0|I love this book.  The cleverness of combining well-lit underwater photography with a playful man's best friend was inspired, and it a blast to thumb through.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I just started listening to Bruno Mars! He is very talented! I bought his first album and loved it. This album is a little bit more gritty. In my opinion,the best songs on this album are :<br /><br />All except none!<br /><br />\\"Gorilla\\" -Took me by surprise. Very sexy though! May be raunchy for some!<br />\\"Show Me\\" -Reggae flow. Very nice!<br />\\"Natalie\\"  -I call it the 80's song. If you listen you'll hear why!<br />\\"Treasure\\" -The other 80's song. I love it! \\"Sounds like something \\"The Jets\\" would sing.<br /><br />The whole album was well put together. This album is Grammy worthy. At least I think so.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|What more can I say other than the title of this review?  It does what it says it does.  There is a bit of a learning curve.  I've talked to others who have never received the full benefit that Evernote provides as they don't take the short time it takes to learn how to use it properly.  There are tutorials on the Evernote website that can bring you up to speed pretty quickly.<br />I'm in the financial services industry (independent rep).  Between Evernote and the Fujitsu ix500 scanner, I am more organized than I've ever been.  Notes regarding phone calls and customer contacts can be conveniently entered into Evernote.  Emails, webpages or parts of webpages, can conveniently be saved to Evernote.  Files can be attached to notes.<br />The Fujitsu scanner allows for direct scanning of documents of all sizes to be scanned directly to Evernote, as well as a variety of other places (such as email).<br />Organization and striving to get as close to paperless as I can are the motivating factors in using these important (to me) tools.<br />I hope readers will not be put off some of the Amazon reviews that were consistently negative (?).  It almost seemed they were orchestrated for a while, since many of the negative reviews seem to focus on privacy concerns that would be cleared up easily if one were to read the Evernote \\"terms of service\\".<br />Anyways, just thought I'd comment on how pleased I am to have Evernote.  It took a long time to find something like this that truly enhances my productivity and client service.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|It scared the hell out of me.Good story line,kept me on the edge of my seat.A horror roller coaster ride.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Look, before all you hardcore fans go and lambast me, previous Taylor Swift material just wasn't my thing.  However, on this album Taylor has made a marked departure from her fairy tale country music roots, and the new album lies very much in the realm of pop.  Also, I don't know what man/boy-man/boy is the source of Taylor's scorn, but bless him because he has inspired some great music.  Bottom line: not country, cheeky lyrics, great album.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|I thought  number three was bad,number 4 just topped it.They should have stopped after 2,one and two were worth watching,the others are not.Three had a poor story line,they didn't even bother with one in four.Just a hodge podge of&#34;strange events&#34; thrown in for shock value.Very disapointing.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game because for one, the graphics are great, and its a very fun puzzle/strategy game that is challenging but not too difficult to the point of annoyance. Every level is different and has new goals and when you beat the game there is still is another whole world you can build on and compete with other people so it never really ends.
B005PK56TA|5.0|It was fresh and well written. It is way better than what else is out there now.<br />I would recommend it to anyone.
B008B92U32|2.0|I had high hopes this would be a fun thing to do but it ended up just looking like terrible whenever I swapped the faces in the picture. Not matter how long I spent trying to get the outlines just right it never worked. Also, I hate the fact that the faces you want to swap have to be in the same picture. It would be a lot more fun, and funnier, if you could take 2 different pictures to do it so you could take peoples faces and swap them on to celebrities body's or something like that.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|This is an okay game, I'm glad that I didn't have to pay for out it because it wouldn't have been worth it.
B00884GR0W|1.0|The graphics were terrible and constantly skipping and messing up. It was very confusing and it was even hard just to walk around. The whole thing was very messed up.
0061992860|4.0|I wanted a book that would provide more details for knots and snares. This pocket guide has given me more options than I expected but not as much detail as I would have liked. I had to practice more because of the lack of details but that has actually helped me remember better.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this app! I use it a lot and I love all of the different options you have to have fun with your pictures. Making colleges is my favorite part of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very challenging in the upper levels but fun and a good way to exercise without busting a sweat!!! like it!
B0085YNML2|3.0|I played this with my brother and its a neat puzzle sort of game but it gets very difficult as the levels increase, we spent so much time on one level that it became more frustrating than fun so we stopped. We love puzzle/strategy type games with a challenge but this one just got to be too much after awhile.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|very convenient and easy to check my accounts since I sell on ebay. good to have when not at home on my computer.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It is very simple to use and all PDF files are all automatically stored in Adobe Reader which is very convenient
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app no matter what they decide to call it will always be AWESOME** if you like the original angry bird games then all the others that came after should be on your game list too including the piggies game too
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is pretty and I like the way it uses negative space. All of the different textures make it pleasing to the eye!
B005HSL626|5.0|wonderful way to waste time and the game has boosts so thats what makes it fun!  very colorful and easy enough for toddlers but I don't know if teaching toddlers to use a knife is good but if you need a moment then this game can work!
B00846F1YW|4.0|Very nice graphics.  Still learning \\"How To\\" work through the hidden objects.  On a Kindle it is hard to move the flashlight without it incurring tapping penalties.  Will add more comments if I get past the first flashlight search!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Each season has a different theme including background music related to each season which makes this game fun & entertaining
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is my favorite book in years! The story was exciting, descriptions of the location were fascinating, and I may have even gained new insight into current events. What makes the book really stand out is the author's portrayal of &#34;Corey&#34; as a serious and gifted operative with an outrageous sense of humor. My world stopped for a few days; I couldn't put the book down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy read and easy to follow. The sweetness of the love story and the roughness of how it came to be made the book a wonderful read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an awesome game this game is also idicting I will play this until one o'clock in the morning and I love how it changes to different areas like to Rio anyone would love this game you should get it now
B005LAIISA|5.0|ALways love the characters, especialy scrat.....many smiles as they encounter life on the planet in the past. Good family flick
B001F8VRLM|5.0|Almost all of the first 8-9 years are super funny, great cast and good company of actors.  It may be a show about broken up marriges, a bountiful of sex capades but in our home, we don't see it as crude.  It's just very funny.  The characters (Charlie, Jake and Alan) play off each other perfectly, along with the rest of the cast.  Great writers.  We dvr the episodes and look forward to watching them at night with dinner, a glass of wine and great laughter after a grueling 1/2 hour of the ever so horroric stories on news and politics. The new last 2 seasons are just not the same.  So we skip those.  If you want a good a laugh, gotta watch.  Have fun...
B008JF8O9M|1.0|It quickly recognized my HP6700 was on the network, but it was not listed under the hundreds of supported HP printers, at least not that I could find since the list was huge so trying to locate it took a long time!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this more than temple run because it a larger course then a trail that had gaps and so forth. it really just a modern day temple run.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album is everything I wanted.  If you like their first album, you will surely fall in love with this one.  It is so hard for a band to produce a second album that is comparable to the first, but Mumford & Sons are an exceptional band who truly love music, and it shows.  A MUST buy!
0345528581|2.0|I've been into practical (i.e., sports- and real-life-oriented) working out for many years.  I've tried everything from the old RCAF Workout (remember that one?) to yoga to various martial arts workouts and a surf workout book.  I've settled on a routine that works, takes about 15 minutes every day, and gives me the ability to go out and do sports even after a long layoff.  Also I can work out even when sick, injured or recovering from surgery (by working around the affected area).  I don't need any special equipment, and I'm not trashing my joints by doing things like squats and pushups (before I learned the hard way, I used to do both of these and now I'm paying for it).  This book is way too complicated.  Staying fit is very simple;this book isn't.  And some of it is destructive over time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it! Really glad I can play on my Kindle.I would highly recommend this game. ! Now I can play anywhere.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I found this to be a very interesting book, but at times a little too clinical for my taste.  He seemed to be writing a Journal article for a medical journal instead of a book for non physicians or medical people.  It got a little boring for me when he got a little too technical.  On the other hand, my husband really liked the book.
B003B02PFO|5.0|So unlike anything I've read of his!  Funny,sad, and joyful.  Actually Brought tears to my eyes.  I recommend it highly.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Excellent storyline, great characters!!!  You will love Roscoe and Jack Reacher's chemistry, honesty and hardcore toughness.  This book is one you never want to put down until you have read the last page...!
B004AQR24W|3.0|The movie was violent as expected...no disappointment for action.  A little slow in some parts due to minimal plot.  Overall a good watch.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|When watching the previews for this movie, one would think it was about Denzel Washington surviving a freak plane crash. However, when watching the movie, the plot is more centered around his abuse of alcohol and other drugs. This movie did not meet my expectations. I think everybody will be surprised by the ending.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a really great read. It engaged me from the start! Watch for the twist and you won't be disappointed!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love shows that are different and interesting.  American Horror Story Asylum is all that and more!  Jessica Lange is a goddess!!!!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|a great game.  just match pairs of cubes.  you could enjoy the seemingly endless choosing of cubes in puzzle mode and or you can challenge yourself and beat your own time. also, there is  cube attack mode.  you have to choose your pairs before the total cubes forms.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|A great story line, humor, and a great ending.  Keeps you hanging.  Lots of details so watch carefully and pay attention.

B008ADUHKW|3.0|That may be the nature of short stories, you have a very short time to provide background, build the story, climax and ending. Alice's stories sometimes feel incomplete. Like &#34;I cannot believe this is the end&#34; sort of feeling. They are OK written, but have read more engaging short stories from other authors. Just OK.
B000W93CHC|5.0|An excellent narrative which began with the pillars of the earth, and continued couple hundred years later.  History seemsto leap out of the pages through each character in the story.
B004GTLVOA|5.0|Fantastic read. Truly phenomenal story. Her writting is incredible. I have learned so many new words since I started reading her outlander series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read. It evoked every emotion that is possible in the human body, and still captivates the readers. Very well done book!!!

B00908DDZM|5.0|Ok lets get this out of the way at the beginning. I hate rap. I hate the attitude, the misogyny, the worship of money and violence. The deadness of it all.<br /><br />I somehow happened to see Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's Thrift Shop the other day on YouTube and it blew me away with the humor for one thing and the celebration of normal people living their lives and having some inventive creative fun on the cheap where most of us live.<br /><br />That song right there is so unlike any rap or hip hop I've ever heard so I had to pick up The Heist and check it out.<br /><br />Wow....<br /><br />I'm telling you, these guys are sooo good! Macklemore's lyrics are just great as is Ryan's beats. The rest of the band is killer too and so original. The trumpet guy rocks, the singers just move you.<br /><br />The Heist is about real people with drug problems, kids dyin for their nikes, gay persecution and marriage, the scamming game that record companies play and two guys with a sound so great that the ceiling can't hold up anymore! :D<br /><br />So this rap I'm really diggin and that's a first thanks to Macklemore and his crew. If these guys aren't swimming in Grammy's at this time next year, something is super wrong!
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|This is an amazing novel and story that takes the reader on a monumental journey across the decades. A must read.
0865478007|5.0|Ben Goldacre demonstrates in sober and forensic fashion how the pharmaceutical industry has corrupted the practice of medicine over the past several decades. His argument is painstaking and compelling and strikes the  right balance between too much and too little technical detail. It the book has a weakness it is that it can be repetitive at times, but the repetition is used to add clarity and sharpness to his withering critique.<br /><br />In the book you will learn how drug companies selectively publish clinical trials of their products, highlighting positive results and masking negative ones; how they manipulate these trials to increase the likelihood of a positive finding and then massage the data after the fact; how they use their massive marketing budgets to advertise to both patient and doctor, to dole out favors to influential figures, and to pay for ghost writers who do most of the grunt work for academics who then attach their names to prominent papers. Their money floods the field, and what it touches it corrupts.<br /><br />Other institutions--academic journals, regulators, patient groups, medical schools--are also raked across the coals for their acquiescence or complicity, whether banal or egregious. No one in the medical ecosystem comes out completely unscathed, but the source of the blight is clearly the drug companies and their massive wealth, which these other actors have become addicted to.<br /><br />At the conclusion of every chapter, Goldacre suggests several things that readers, whether doctors or average citizens, can do to help improve the current situation. This book was highly informative and should be read by anyone interested in health care or in public policy generally.
B007REV4YI|4.0|(This review talks about details of the film in broad strokes, but if you want a zero-spoiler viewing experience, stop reading Amazon and watch the movie!  You'll like it.)    Despite what critics always had to say, I never minded the \\"Bond Formula:\\" cool stunts, rich locations, fancy cars and unobtainable women, all carried off by an unflappable alcoholic who's better than everyone at everything.  It worked well enough so far, and I never needed it to change.  When 2006's Casino Royale came out, I found that I enjoyed the change-up, but I also left the movie glad that the stage was set for more \\"formula\\" outings.    Unfortunately, someone thought one emotional detour wasn't enough.  And so they made Quantum of Solace, seemingly believing that they could make a never-ending series about a moody sad-sack.    Well, with \\"Skyfall,\\" it looks like producer Barbara Broccoli may have finally found a way to move forward.    Yes, the film feels like another reboot, and yes, Bond girls are again pushed to the corners, but by the end of this film we have classic characters back where we need them, psychological conflicts purged, and a mature Bond who's ready to pursue the bad guy with the casual detachment he's been missing for the last three films.    Skyfall itself is imperfect but usually entertaining.  For starters, Bond is past pining over dead girls, and he has the humanity the character used to have in the Connery days.  So he can stop and help someone who's hurt while not sobbing over it.  The lack of \\"emo\\" also makes room for lots of clever, witty dialogue between the talented cast of actors.    The action is pretty good but Casino Royale's was better.  Visually, however, this film is peerless.  The \\"travelogue\\" aspects of Bond films stopped working for audiences long ago, but this film brings them back and they feel like a revelation.  Every location gets to show off at its most stunning and exotic.  I wish I'd seen this in IMAX.  The film also tries a few new stepsregarding sexuality (you'll know the scene when you see it), and while the angle is a new one, it really harkens back to the early Connery days, when the Bond films were actually considered sexually progressive.    Everyone's talking about the villain, and he is in fact pretty memorable.  The writers definitely watched The Dark Knight's Joker a few times, but if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best!  He's another crazy person with an improbably precise plan that seems to anticipate every move the good guys make.    I said the movie is imperfect.  Its implausibility hurts it a bit, especially at the climax.  Logic just goes away, and that's difficult to forgive considering the stakes.  Also, there's a character toward the end that was clearly written for one very particular actor, for the series' 50th anniversary.  And when That One Actor does not appear, you're left with the equivalent of a drunken stand-in.  The part just doesn't make sense without That One Actor, and they should have cut the role when he refused it.    Despite its flaws and dramatic themes, \\"Skyfall\\" finds its way back to the \\"fun\\" Bond formula of years past.  Here's a medium-dry hoping there's more fun to be had in the future.
B0049J5EWW|5.0|I loved it when it first came out and my kid loves it now. I may have to buy this DVD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game even better than the first Temple Run! graphics are amazing. Ive been playing on the Kindle Fire and have no.problems.
B001OL4TR4|3.0|I watched the whole thing and didn't regret a minute of it.  Michelle is a knockout.  She was younger in the film than any others I've seen.  What a beauty and she can act too.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are a great read.  Hard to put down, would recomend for anyone to read of 18 and up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Would have never read it had it not been for my daughter's insistence.  She asked me to watch the movie first because her friend had a small part in the movie.  After seeing the movie I knew I had to read the book.  It's rare that I read a book without putting it down for long periods of time.  It's even more rare that I take the time to write a review on the book.  The story is very compelling and keeps you turning the pages. I find interesting how the author weaves a tale that reflects cautions of our own society and the blurring of reality.  Highly recommend this book
B0038JN6VA|5.0|i love it small easy to use. got here fast and i can link them together a must have honestly!
B0051XQI84|3.0|This is a cute movie for younger kids.  I would not call it a family film bc I dont think it is the type of movie that adults and children  can both enjoy.  It is a bit too &#34;kiddish&#34; and &#34;childish silly&#34; for adults to enjoy.
0425252868|5.0|My dad is one of the few WWII vets around; as a former bomber pilot, he was thrilled to receive this book as a Christmas present.  I heard Adam speak on NPR and immediately sat down and ordered the book!<br /><br />As soon as my dad finishes the book, I plan on reading it!<br /><br />Many thanks for a wonderful story put into print for future generations!
B0095T3H2U|2.0|I watched  the trailer for this movie and it looked sooo funny so I was really excited to watch it.  The few scenes that they showed in the trailer were the only funny parts of the movie!!  The rest of the movie was really dumb and just way toooo long.  Would not recommend it at all!  It just took way to long to get to the point and was not funny or interesting.  At some points it simply got wierd...I did not enjoy it at all.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Its a good movie. I am a fun of the old MI tv series but not much of the new MI movies but I enjoy this one.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This game would not load for me. I bought this game the night of the Granny Awards. The next day I tried to play put would not load. BEAWARE. Do not get this game.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|I've watched this movie several times and it never fails to entertain.  Many movies have tried to capture that late 1940's-early 1950's atmosphere of Los Angeles.  This one succeeds very well.  Excellent performances by Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger, Guy Pearce and Danny DeVito.  Highly recommended.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great to have the saga in one bundle. Great for all Star Wars fans.<br />Good to have while waiting for next episodes (probably 10 more years).
B0071U3KCW|4.0|What can you say about a fifty year old classic.  Music, songs, and dancing are great.  Some of the dialogue of the Jets gang is 1950's slang but then everything gets dated eventually.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good game to test your wit and keep your eye on the &#34;road' ahead.  It is very addictive and will try your patience but you keep trying anyway.
1592407889|5.0|I picked up this book while killing time between classes at a local B & N that also houses a Starbucks. After reading the first chapter I was hooked. I bought the book later the same day and finished it on the subway the following day. It is indeed a page-turner. I must admit to finding it funny & entertaining. I am sure Ms. Parker might dispute the humor, but clones are funny!<br />I would recommend this book to fans of the idiosyncratic Shirly Mclaine, and to all of us with less than \\"normal\\" parents and upbringings.<br />A really good read.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|A great thriller of excitement, this made us want to watch the rest of the action hero movies!!! We are now going to watch the Hulk!!!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Enjoyed it as much as the sequel. Spent 20 days in England last June and was marveled at the old homes and castles. This book made more sense to me because of having been there.
B00683JK9K|3.0|Could never get the puzzle pieces to turn.  But did move the pieces around a bit to get a feel for how it would work moving the pieces to the puzzle screen, and didn't really feel it was something I would enjoy.  You don't see all the pieces at one time and have to move them all into the puzzle screen to actually work on the puzzle.
B000000WCA|4.0|This is a good album for anybody who is into Pop music, and likes the 90's music. Every song in this album is great.
B008NC1LJ6|3.0|This movie was interesting in that the characters were interconnected & there were surprises. I enjoyed it. The acting was great.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|This movie in blu-ray is just something else. I love this movie and it plays great on my PS3. Clear picture and very good sound quality.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I bought this as a gift, it came in a timely fashion which is something I was worried about. The packaging was very neat and looked untouched. Over all I had no complaints what so ever.
B00A2AU0KI|3.0|It's difficult to hear as the words  are mumbled.  It starts out slow, but picks up at the end of the movie
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|In this formidable book, Michael Lewis explains unambiguously the bankruptcy of the financial system of the Western world, its roots, the people and the machinations involved, the tremendous cost of the rescue and the social implications.<br /><br />A giant conspiracy<br />Billions of dollars were lent to US households who couldn't repay them, but, were told how to lie in order to get them (subprime mortgages). The banks needed as many loans as possible to package them as CDO's (collateral debt obligations) in order to slake the insatiable thirst for those products all over the Western world.<br />A slice of 80 % of these CDO's got a triple A rating from the rating agencies (for fat fees). But, the banks repackaged the rest (20 %) into new CDO's, of which again 80 % got a triple A rating.<br />When many households defaulted on their loans (when the `teaser' interest rate was terminated), a financial tsunami shook the West.<br /><br />The other side of the trade<br />Some people smelled the coming of a giant collapse and bought very cheaply CDS's (credit default swaps) on the worst slices of the worst CDO's. A perfect, but dangerous strategy: the other parties involved could go bankrupt, or the government could step in to guarantee all subprime mortgages at 100 %.<br />In the end, they made staggering gains with these CDS's (ex. 5 million $ with a bet of $300, 000).<br /><br />Fat cats and meager mice<br />With the collapse of the financial system, Wall Street firms faced bankruptcy. But, Congress stepped in and bought for up to 2 % of US GDP (Gross Domestic Product) subprime mortgage assets. Billions of dollars were pumped in the banks. But, the households which had defaulted on their loans received nothing. On the contrary, they faced `foreclosure-gate'.<br />For Michael Lewis, the upper classes raped the middle and lower classes. The subprime mortgage market was an engine of exploitation and, ultimately, destruction.<br /><br />A fundamentally corrupt system and its roots<br />The decision to turn Wall Street partnerships into public corporations transferred the financial risks to the shareholders. Partners would never have bet the farm.<br />Moreover, the US bond market wasn't seriously regulated: `it was laissez faire until you got in deep sh.t' (J. Gutfreund).<br />The bank CEO's didn't even understand their own balance sheets and their mind-boggling leverage levels. Many of them were not punished. On the contrary, some became important characters operating behind closed doors, trying to figure out what to do next!<br /><br />Never in the financial history of the Western world have such massive machinations so blatantly shown that free markets are rigged (here, sellers deceived the buyers), and that, ultimately, the taxpayers have always to step in to socialize the losses.<br />This book is a must read for all those who want to understand the world we live in.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Not usually into this type of book, but a relative suggested Name of the Wind and I loved it, so of course had to read Day Two.  Now I can't wait for Day Three!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I was very disappointed in the movie especially with Denziel washington in it. I expected more excitement and drama. It was too slow.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome game. I wish it was likethe Pc version tho but still it is an awesome game.
B001MNFOIW|3.0|&#34;Wanted&#34; is the Taco Bell of movies.  You know it's not good for you and you'll most likely regret it, but there's a teenager inside you that says, &#34;What's the worst that could happen?&#34;  So you watch it and a couple hours later you're rushing to the bathroom cursing yourself.<br /><br />The movie deserves two  stars.  I gave it three for Angelina Jolie.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Put together during the writers' strike.  Proof that something awesome can come out of a small budget.  Good acting and excellent music.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is one of the best authors out there.  I loved this book.  The Forgotten Garden is still my favorite, but this is a close second.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Good story up until the cheap ending. Flynn is not a master of the word...the book was written poorly, in my opinion.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great book makes me thankful we are blessed with these dedicated and fearless people. The one aspect of paying taxes that we can be proud of.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|we can't wait for season 9!  Always a sure bet.  We love this series, filling in with NCIS to keep us sane
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Having now watched so many BBC TV productions, I am even more impressed at the quality of the programming and BBC's apparent interest in adapting literature written by women. Lark Rise, Bramford, Cranford, and Murdoch Mysteries are but four rich and thought-provoking programs that I have enjoyed immensely. Not only do I appreciate the in-depth exploration of  age-old themes such as women's rights and classism, but I thrill to the high quality of the acting and the cinematography.
1417738065|5.0|Yes, I have read the book, but I read it long ago and my memory is not perfect.  In 1988 I was persuaded by a college student (I was 44) to investigate the neo-Nazi movement.  He had been persuaded by one of his professors to do the same thing.  My adoptive mother was the daughter of Ukrainian Jews who came to Boston circa 1900.  I was therefore highly unlikely to become an anti-Semite.  Like everyone else, I took it for granted that Hitler was an evil madman, the ultimate bad guy of history.  I therefore approached the reading of Mein Kampf and a bunch of other such books and publications, racist and anti-Semitic, with a bias against them.  I found that Mein Kampf did not appear to me to be the product of a deranged mind.  Economics bores me, and the economic parts of the book did not appeal to me.  I managed to read the whole book with as much dispassion as possible (\\"with an open mind\\").  I had as a teenager seen many pictures of the devastation wrought by the Germans during WWII.  The Nazis were not heroes to me.  Nevertheless, I read this book and many others written by hardcore racists and anti-Semites.  I learned to see the world from their point of view.  I fell into the habit of \\"Jew-counting\\" i.e., looking at the masthead and table of contents of magazines to see how many Jews were there.  There were a lot.  I began to wonder whether the anti-Semites were not correct after all about the claim that the Jews control the press.  This proved to be a slippery slope indeed.  Although I have long since ceased to read such material, it still had a surprising effect on my outlook that has never entirely gone away.  One does not have to be a bigot or a madman to fall under the spell of this sort of thing.  A century ago, racism and anti-Semitism were quite common, not merely in Germany but also in America and elsewhere.  Many, perhaps most, Americans used to believe that \\"the only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\"  I don't want to go off on a tangent, but I wish to point out that bigotry is not something that exists only among ignorant people.  The eugenics movement was common a century ago, and it was widely believed that lower-class people should be sterilized i.e., exterminated.  Hitler's mindset was not an aberration, it was typical of his time and place.  Hitler did not invent genocide.  The Namibians were butchered by the Germans when Hitler was young.  As luck would have it, my landlord was a Jew at the time when I was reading this stuff, and his nasty disposition didn't help me to ward off the temptation to believe that the Nazis might have been correct on some points.  I am trying to point out that you don't have to be a stereotypical trailer trash type in order to develop a social grudge of some sort.  It is an historical fact that many Jews were Communists, and the Germans, Russians and Hungarians had to deal with them in the streets in a way unlikely to discourage a belief that Communism is Jewish.  The Neocons of today are the children of yesterday's Communists.  So, if you think that Mein Kampf is \\"the ravings of a lunatic,\\" you understand nothing about the social background of the book.  As for the style of this book being \\"turgid\\" (the favorite word of those reviewers who disagree with the message), this is a matter of opinion, and pretty much falls into the category of ad hominem attacks and terms of belittlement (such as drab, shabby, shoddy, etc.).  As for the charge that this is a wicked book because it laid the groundwork for the Holocaust, one could point out that the vast number of human beings (yes, that's right, human beings) killed in abortion clinics since Roe vs Wade has been far greater than 6,000,000.  To say that abortion is not murder is roughly the same as denying the Holocaust, is it not?
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I have tried several free calculators over the last couple of years and this one seems the best of all. It has ease of use and does a few advanced calculations.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|As a fan of the show, I started reading this with some hesitation because a book never translates the same. I was very pleasantly surprised. I loved being inside dexters head in a way that can never be found on screen.
B0091REZMW|4.0|nice art details. I just wish free ways get more diamonds for game play but overall a win! I do recommend for any hidden object game enthusiast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun and addicting game. When I first got it I couldn't stop playing it and I kept trying to get a higher score. It's a great game.! (:
B005OP2928|5.0|Whatever mood your in, get deliriously happy quickly with \\"Modern Family\\"!! The best! The funniest! EVER!!  The creators are BRILLIANT!!  You cannot go wrong with this one! A show for everyone...
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie-fun with wonderful British cast.  Judy Dench and Maggie Smith-what greats!  Most likely will be enjoyed by the more mature in age viewer.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This seemed like the darkest of the Bond films but very well written and Craig did a fine job as Bond. The new Q was great, M, as always is excellent, and the new Moneypenny even was a pleasant surprise. Can't wait for the NEXT Bond, as it's definitely coming.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I like the continuing Jack Ryan saga but I get the feeling the new authors aren't quite up to par with the Clancy era novels
B0063IH60K|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!  I love the little bonus it give you in at the finish of your game.  I like the challenge of this game as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series and have become addicted! I wish I could watch it every day! As with all of the Amazon streaming, it stutters and drops the connection.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book is well written by a very experienced brain surgeon who suffers a serious infection that causes a  seven day coma. During this time he experiences un-forgetable things; most would call it an out-of-body experience. I could not put it down! Food for thought for believers and non-believers alike.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good movie, but kind of a downer. Denzel's acting is top notch as always. Amazon streaming always stutters on our wireless TV and eventually dropped the connection altogether. Had to watch the last 40 minutes on my laptop in the same room.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so<br /> awesome rio is way better than world tour NYC i think its the best game ever
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Always like Tommy Lee Jones. He does a good job in this movie portraying the Dave Robicheaux character.  He does a better job than Alec Baldwin did in the first movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love playing this game on my Kindle Fire. I look forward to playing this everyday. this would be a game for everyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series about the lives of two classes.  Seriously you dictate how many words I have to write???  Not good
B0063IH60K|5.0|With really flexible playing options and quick responses to touch commands, this game is top notch.  Automatic move completions also are most helpful.  Great on the Kindle Fire.  Hard to beat the price, too!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|great game for killing. time just wish that there was a faster way to get coins. no issues other than that
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Oh my goodness.... I couldn't give this book enough stars!  It is fictional, but it truly helped to paint the picture of what it must be like to be the person who is suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.  I happen to be caring for my grandmother, and after reading this book I have gained much more empathy and patience.  The disease is so hard to comprehend.  This story is about a successful woman who happens to find out in her fifties that she has early onset Alzheimer's Disease.  I guarantee that anyone who is dealing with this horrid disease will love this book.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|While I'm not a fan of blood and gore, I am definitely a fan of Crowe's acting in this movie.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|This isnt necessarily the type of music that gets you on the treadmill to work for that pizza you ate last night. It is however a good album and fun to listen to on your way to work!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Wall-E is my favorite of all of Disney's love stories. The simple devotion of Wall-E to Eve should strike a chord with viewers of all ages.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is a great CD.  The lyrics are intelligent and meaningful and the beats are great as well.  It's been a long time since I heard rap that was quality.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great. Wish it was a little easier to use.  The math problems always wake me up.  Good app. Nice. Fun.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very addicting to read!! I was hooked from the first chapter. I can't wait to read the next book city of ashes
B00006AW2L|4.0|...and afected by the US release messing with the orginal UK format.  Everyone knows \\"Paint it, Black\\" and \\"Under my Thumb\\"...the rest can feel a little underdeveloped as the Stones are working on the notions that would formulate \\"Let it Bleed\\" and other classics.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's fun for everyone. Even my three year old plays it and beats me most of the time. It's great.
B008B9JSD2|5.0|Nanni Moretti is now officially a prophet. A movie about a Cardinal with too guilty a conscience to accept his being named Pope. Okay, so in real life it took 8 years, but...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down! By far the best Nicholas sparks book...no the best book I have read in a long time.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Beginning was ok, middle was funny, end was depressing.  Reminded me of &#34;The Apartment.&#34;  Watching a breakup is painful, even if a talking/stoned teddy bear is involved.
B006LSZECO|3.0|reminds me of a movie with michael douglas and kathleen turner . he is a detective, ithink, and she is suspected of murder.<br />it is open-ended. there is a weapon under the bed or pillow, so you don't know if she will love him or kill him. quite a devious character.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I think this game is awesome!  I play almost every day and it doesn't  seem to get old! and best of all it was free!
080701429X|4.0|Had to get this book for a class but it was very good. My only complaint is that the book was severely bent. That said, I knew I wasn't paying for brand-new quality. It was fiiine.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I think this is one of the best he has written.  The plot unfolds as you read and you are not sure what to expect.  Looking forward to the next one.
B001H1SVO8|1.0|WAY too much gratuitous violence - no wait - please let me revise that: the violence is excessive but not gratuitous - it seems to be the whole purpose of the movie - its theme may be &#34;how much violence and human physical abuse can we get an audience to swallow?&#34; That's 1/2 of my objection to Fight Club. &#60;mini spoiler alert:&#62; The other half is that the 'unexpected' intellectual climax makes absolutely no sense. I'm not saying 'don't see it.' I'm just saying I hated it, primarily for those 2 reasons. And I consistently like Brad Pitt's work. Helena Bonham Carter's performance was masterful, in an over-the-top Tim Burtonesque direction. I've never been a Norton fan (except for in The Honeymooners) but I do respect his talent, and it shows here. Creepy Movie. Waste of time. Waste of storage. Waste of makeup. Irony Dept: I watched the movie at the insistence of a woman who is a fighter against domestic violence perpetrated on women. Go figure. I support her efforts, but not this one.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I am glad I read it so I know what his writing is like, but it is not really my kind of book.  I think however that teenagers would like it.  maybe it will appeal to their sense of adventure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i bought this for my wife, but became so involved, I watched  it and the first two seasons myself. I don't usually enjoy this British drawing room stuff,but this is really good.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|bla bla bla bla bla bla blablabla bla bla. oh u r listening ok. I JUST WANT MY 3 GEMS O.K.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|That's all--simply fantastic. There is absolutely no reason to write a florid, overly-parsed review of this album. The music speaks for itself.
3864070570|5.0|This book amazed me.  For starters, it is absolutely huge at over 500 pages.  What is really remarkable is the quality of the photos, which are truly gorgeous.  Most are very large in size and in full brilliant color.  Plus, the coverage goes way beyond the usual scenes of cars on the track.  There are numerous images that capture the participants themselves, what was happening in the pits, the stands, the overall venue, the surrounding countryside, etc.  It is all quite stunning.  You almost feel like you have stepped back in time and are actually there.  Frankly, this book is a lot more evocative than many I have paid hundreds of dollars for.  At just over $40 shipped, it's a gift!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|I Love this movie!!! And, I have not met a person that does not love it. The colors in the movie are Spectacular.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Practical straightforward gratuitous sex and violence!  Sets the stage for a complete reboot of the series!  Cannot wait for next Bond installment!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even though many feel that the middle book in a trilogy is the weakest, I did not find this so in Catching Fire.  Katniss’ adventures continue at a high level of intensity.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Entertaining book with  lot of great insights on show business and life. I would have liked more on 30 ROCK and Saturday Night Live. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to people who are fans of her work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I, at first, shied away from this series as I figured that any book that became a hit movie could not be any good.  I was mistaken!  I held off reviewing any of this series until finishing all of them.  Ms. Collins has created a character, Katness, who will always be with me.  This contest between good and evil continues until the ending in the finale, Mockingjay.<br />Although, this series is supposedly written for young adults, it captivated me, a 70 year-old adolescent.
0743238257|5.0|My book group and I read this and it was great.  Very good insight.  A must read.  I can see why it was recommended by the Library of Congress.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really love the first Temple Run and I'd like to say the same about this one but really the only problem is that they need to improve the tilting. The game should be able to tilt way easier. But other than that it's totally great!  :)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show has very good actors, and an interesting plot. It is well written, keeps you interested in finding out more about the mystery.
B00AGKHALQ|1.0|The release date had set on here for the longest time February 12. I go on here today and it says march 12. get the release date correct
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Typisch Amerikanische Frauen/Mädchen Phantasie.<br />Story linear. Keine Überaschengende Wendung.<br />Reich und schön für Amerikanische Hausfrauen.<br />Fehlte nur noch eine Verfilmung als Trilogie :-(
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen. The writers are brilliant. My favorite character is the Dowager of Downton.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Typisch Amerikanische Frauen/Mädchen Phantasie.<br />Story linear. Keine Überaschengende Wendung.<br />Reich und schön für Amerikanische Hausfrauen.<br />Fehlte nur noch eine Verfilmung als Trilogie :-(
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Throughout the third book (and for that matter the second one as well) events jumped to conclusions without providing sufficient detail or support to inform the reader how and why they occurred, thus leaving it to the reader's imagination to fill in the blanks.  Since the book is intended for young audiences as well as adults it probably shouldn't include Ludlum or Clancy levels of detail, but I found it lacking.  Finally, the rather abrupt ending was disappointing and left me hoping for a different and more extensive conclusion.  Its as though Collins was just too worn out to give her trilogy a proper completion.  Had the final two books retained the compelling &#34;page turning&#34; attraction of &#34;The Hunger Games,&#34; her's would have been great, rather than ordinary.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Typisch Amerikanische Frauen/Mädchen Phantasie.<br />Story linear. Keine Überaschengende Wendung.<br />Reich und schön für Amerikanische Hausfrauen.<br />Fehlte nur noch eine Verfilmung als Trilogie :-(
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Archer's mastery of suspense and allowing the hero to not prevent all the bad things from happening made the book seem real.  I can't wait to read him again!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I really wanted to like this case.  I was happy to see it at such a discount.... but now I know why.  The speaker vibrates and not only is it difficult to hear your caller, they can not hear you.  I tried taking it off and putting it back on.... making sure to get a good seal.  I even googled some tips to stop the speaker issue (seems to be very common).  Apparently, the new model of the case does not have this problem.  Pay full price for the newest model.  I gave it 2 stars because I think it would be a very durable/water resistant case, if I could deal with the speaker issue.
B006P96PAO|5.0|My family enjoyed the message in Fireproof and Courageous.  Thanks for making a movie that the whole family can enjoy, be inspired by, and receive a Christ like message from.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this product at such a reasonable price..  I saved a lot, and it was well worth it.. Thanks
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I have seen this on stage and the movie, and listening to this soundtrack just helps relax me and takes all the stress away.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this product at such a reasonable price..  I saved a lot, and it was well worth it.. Thanks
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It is a wonderful past time pleaser and a different kind of puzzle making me want to play it everyday.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this product at such a reasonable price..  I saved a lot, and it was well worth it.. Thanks
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I like how it started just where the first book left off.can't wait to get started on the next!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this product at such a reasonable price..  I saved a lot, and it was well worth it.. Thanks
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|This book had what I want in a sequel. The main character - Vin - was developed and dealt with issues of maturity everyone encounters. The magical framework was consistent and exciting. Elend's development mirrored the real world pitfalls of implementing idealized concepts, though he was able to learn his lessons withouit loss of his personal integrity. The tale was complete and satisfying in and of itself and yet still leaving me hungry for the third book of the trilogy.
B006YC74E8|5.0|The thing I been looking for for my KINDLE FIRE. I been looking and searching a long time and wa-la it appears. A BIG recommendation for this one
B001NHNG64|2.0|Solid airplane read...but there are just too many unbelieable situations here to take credibly. There are better books in this series.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't like Gone Girl and never finished reading it.  Going back in time was very annoying.  The husband was not likeable and I never made a connection with the wife.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The is a great introduciont to a great character. Kind of reminds me of a military version of Spenser. Good plot. Good pacing. Good read.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I don't believe that anything more needs to be said!<br />Had to buy it for the kids. instantly hooked !
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|I had this game on ios and was really fun so u guys should try it but many of u who will just start playing will feel that u cant beat the game without IAP<br /> but otherwise its a good game u guys should check out
B003ZSJ212|5.0|nice to have the complete set.  Can really tell the difference between the first (III) version and the last (II) one.
B0091ICDHU|4.0|this book is a great read that inspires young love and allows you to believe that it's worth it if its real, the continuation through Colleen's next book &#34;Point of Retreat&#34; is also extremely well written and gives us a look at the young couple's love from a different point of view, I was captivated through both and can't wait for a new book by this author
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Well written by a prodigy I'd never heard of.  Lifestyle tips enjoyabe and must be taken seriously by someone so accomplished as a kid.  I will get The 4 Hour body soon even though it may be too late for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I found this book to be interesting and intense and would recommend it to all, the complications and struggles that face the protagonist are gripping and the writing is just fantastic
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Open and honest -  one medical professional's experience in the afterlife.  Proof of Heaven a must read for anyone who wonders what happens next.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|Another one of those titles where it's impressive for a phone game, in this case because it's 3D, but ultimately it's just not very much fun.<br />The controls are very wooden and stop/starty. The overall feel isn't very slick. I got it for free and I still don't want to keep it on the phone.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced and timely.  A back door look into the world of espionage in real time... you will love this book.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Watch it though.  If you get this for your kids, you need to set your kindle not to allow purchases without a password.  It asks the kid to purchase all kinds of stuff ..you'll have a $500 bill before you know it.  This is for very young girls, so be safe the ability of the kid to make purchases on your account.  I keep a gift card on my account to buy stuff with, but you could really get in trouble if you have your regular account attached.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A true piece of work, something for everyone! Even my husband has gotten hooked. The only thing I don't like is when an episode is over.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Good app and it's very helpful especially during the times I want to travel and do not know what the weather will be like once I get to where it is I'm heading. At least I know how to dress and what cloths to take. Putting in the cities is a bit difficult because of the predicted text functions. Either tell me the city does not exist or just don't do a search. It putting in something I do not want and it repeatedly putting in the same unwanted city is aggrevating to say the least.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 and still going strong...just love the show!  I really enjoy the character development  and the costumes are just beautiful.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|Looks intersting and it works. Just have to find the correct situation in which to use it. I'm sure some kid is going to love it.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|Good movie, but  I think it was a bit too long...it could have been condensed and still would be enjoyable.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Had played this at my grandkids, and now I have it on my KindleFire.  Enjoy beating the levels. Husband kids me about playing games, but I pointed out you need to work in trajectories and &#34;physics&#34; to make the birds hit so the most piggies are taken out at one time.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Many similarities to 50 shades but I still enjoyed it and look forward to the third book to come out this spring.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Wasn't able to properly download onto my KindleFire and so I deleted it. Glad it was &#34;free&#34; to begin with.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I was looking for more adventure, waiting for a surprise twist.  The begining starts out strong but after the first 10 pages it just becomes a history lesson about the land, the people and their customs.  The adventure finally comes in the end of the book, but it could have had more surprises and excitement during my history lesson, which was most of the book, and a touch of boring.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I love all the Twilight movies...I did enjoy the books more but, that is not unusual.  Good price and a perfect purchase for me because I am not interested in the extras!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Another thriller written by the &#34;Best Story Teller of Mystery's&#34;. It's a page turner. I have a kindle so I can turn on the adventures of<br />Jack Reacher at any time. Loved the book
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|I wish to share this documentary with my family. I am happy to see he is finally getting just due.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of heaven<br /><br />I have never felt so serene while reading anything about a near death experience.  It has allowed me to understand Love in my life, and to visit in Heaven through the eyes of the author
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An excellent book for murder mystery readers. A lot of twist and turns to find out who did the dirty deed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! It really sucks you in and keeps you in your toes. The love between sky and holder is addicting. I read it twice because I couldn't get enough. She ended the book well and didn't keep you hanging. Although, I would love to read some sequels of this. I will definitely be reading more books by this author.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|There are films that leave us with silence. Few, to be sure, but they render you utterly speechless. What could be a more appropriate response to \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\"? This isn't a film that elicits the customary cheers, chills, or groans of disappointment. Instead, the credits roll, and you're left feeling physically exhausted and emotionally spent.  Thanks to a spectacular screenplay, expert direction from Kathryn Bigelow, and a tremendous performance by Jessica Chastain, the previous two-and-a-half hours demanded nothing short of your full participation. The result is a fulfilling (albeit grim) moviegoing experience unlike anything else offered to audiences this year.<br /><br />Every history has its context, and this film opens to a blank screen and audio from 9/11 World Trade Center emergency calls. This is the terror that engendered vengeance. Vengeance that unfolded in many phases: methodical torture and information gathering, a sprawling investigation that spanned continents, and, finally, the military infiltration of Bin Laden's compound. Not for a moment does the suspense or uneasiness let up; every twist and shock, like a tighter turn of the screw, heightens the narrative as well as our involvement in the proceedings.<br /><br />Maya (what is easily one of the best, if not *the* best, performances of the year), through the able and full-blooded interpretation of Chastain, sublimates a viewer's frustration and fear through her tireless devotion to finding and eliminating her target. She is the cipher through which we can interpret the information and experience the thrill of every discovery and disappointment of every misstep or dead-end. One of the more memorable scenes, in which Maya unleashes a torrent of demands at her superior for adequate resources and manpower to track down a lead, simultaneously achieves catharsis (however short-lived) and ramps up the suspense for the final half of the story.<br /><br />The ultimate effect of this film is like looking into a ledger to see the moral, physical, and financial costs of \\"the greatest manhunt in history.\\" And it is a mark of a mature filmmaker that Bigelow does not lead viewers to regard the accounts as either justified or somehow overzealous. In the final, quiet moments of the film, the viewer must become auditor of the story and consider whether or not the swift midnight raid over Abbottabad canceled a decade's debt of grief and waiting. One pundit has singled out \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" from other Best Picture contenders by calling it \\"enrichment,\\" and it is surely that. It's a movie that's sharp, poignant, and (for its namesake) dark.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a nice game.. keeps you entertained, simple, keeps you going, fun, enjoyable, hasn't frozen, doesn't have a bug, real good for children anytime. I honestly love it..!
B0073COMUW|5.0|I ordered some lighting ever 7 watt led bulbs last time, they were pretty good for only consuming 7 watt. I need some more bulbs that offer slightly more brightness, so I ordered 8 of this. They are perfect, very bright and comfortable light, no noise no waiting time. Delivered fast too.
0670023329|4.0|Shin's story is an amazing one and it is well told by Mr. Harden.  As one of the first stories to come out North Korea's gulag system, this is a critical addition for researchers.  Still, the author spends a good deal of time rallying against the regime and arguing politics when the grim story of Shin's confinement and escape should be more than enough to convince any reader of North Korea's corruption and brutal strong-arming.  If you're interested in a politicized view of North Korea, these additions won't bother you.  I, however, felt like Harden was preaching to the choir and found the political discussion a bit tedious.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Interesting and diverse characters, lovely scenery, no excessive violence or foul language  Nice to watch without all the insulting commercials!
0385523912|5.0|This book is a must-have for those interested in the strange, hermetic country of North Korea.  I'm a librarian and I've read quite a lot on the subject because of work and this is hand's down the best book on the country.  It is unique to most other literature on North Korea because it is the first to adequately give the reader a view of what it's like to be an average person in this oppresive society.  Most other books discuss the upper echelons of the Party and the ruling family, but only discuss the average person in terms of statistics.  This book completely breaks that mold by focusing instead on five or six every day people who eventually ended up defecting.  As a result, this book presents a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of denial and the ability of a crooked regime to uphold a clearly crumbling society through relentless propoganda and fear.<br /><br />I honestly cannot recommend this book enough.  I taut it to everyone I know and everyone who has read it comes back completely amazed.  I think the first words out of almost everyone's mouth has been 'Wow'.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show.  When I found the books, I couldn't wait to read them.  If your a fan of the show then you'll love the books!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season One is available on NetFlix in good quality.<br /><br />After researching I decided Amazon was the best place to get season two.<br /><br />I bought and downloaded (not streamed) the HD version but the quality is not that good. Just slightly better than DVD but nowhere near Blue Ray quality.<br /><br />I would be tempted to purchase Amazons annual movie subscription (like NetFlix) but if this is as good as the quality gets then I'll pass.<br /><br />If you are reading this then you already know Downton Abbey is awesome.

B00005LC4Z|5.0|If you don't like this move check for a pulse... Great film, and it will last for generations. Hope you enjoy it as well.
B008B92U32|4.0|My grandson and I had a great time playing around with this.  I'm on the lookout now for public domain pictures we can play around with.  He loves the filters and adjustments on the camera function, too.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I'm a sucker for animation and particularly when it includes Dracula, the Wolfman and the Mummy.  Adam Sandler does a wonderful job voicing the worried Drac dad.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran is able to be simultaneously laugh out loud funny and dead on serious; in other words ~ brilliant!!!  This book is painfully honest; I laughed until I cried.  I hope she comes to the US on a book tour.  If she does, she's welcome to stay with us!
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Good story.<br />Typical Follett suspense and characters you root for. Worth reading, enjoyed from cover to cover. A a a
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is cute and it doesn't take a long time to play.Perfect to have something while waiting for an appointment.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great little game for a non-gamer to relax for a few minutes and play a game that tests your abilities.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|A nice comforting and easy read. An enlightening story of what it may be like for someone in a coma after a tragic accident and making a choice to stay or go
B001DHXT2A|5.0|This new take on the Hulk is in every way superior to that piece of crap Ang Lee put together.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Tess of the D'urbervilles deserves 5 stars. Beautifully done. Enjoyed it immensely. I would recommend it to everyone. Loved it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very unobtrusive, but with adequate notifications if necessary. It's also the first one I've seen with a calibration routine. The graphics for the app and widget could use a touch up, but overall the interface was simple and easy to use.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|ok this app is amazing whoever made this is awesome just saying if your thinking about getting this app so get it
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Well written and well acted.  A must see movie, suspenseful and gripping.  Well worth spending money on.  See it today
B007MNV5WU|5.0|It is cool because the gravity of each planet changes the direction of your travel and it will help you in school
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I have made a collection of Blu-Ray superhero movies which i'm proud of and even though this is not oscar stuff i do enjoy watching it from time to time. My latest addition was Dick Tracy on BD
B00846F1YW|4.0|I wasn't very fond of the first Mysteryville but I found this second attempt more engaging. The graphics are well done and at least one puzzle had me stumped enough that it took several stabs. The story is a little dopey and this game must have been produced in Hungary considering all the Hungarian food references. One little spelling error that bothers only people with OCD (such as myself) but, other than that, an enjoyable way to kill a rainy afternoon.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book was very good!  Hurry and please come out with another one!<br />This one will be hard to beat
B0063GORYU|5.0|Better than the original game. More challenging. Try two decks of cards. The hint button helps a lot but the more you play the less you will need it.
B00899E5B4|4.0|Some really good new music. To me Joe Walsh is one of the best guitar players. Combine this with some of his down to earth, about real life lyrics. The song Analog Man almost fits me to a &#34;T&#34; this whole digital put your life out there in cyber space thing is not for me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm not going to summarize Gone Girl. I do not want to risk the chance I may leak spoilers because this is one of those books where it will ruin the entire story. Take the synopsis and go with it.<br /><br />I had a love hate relationship with Nick. I thought he was extremely interesting but I was so confused why he did half the stuff he did. I'm not entirely sure why he started lying to the cops from the get go, it just all around confused me. I did like the dryness of his character though. I hated Amy. At first I did like her but the more and more that was revealed in her diary pages, I hated her.  I'm really not going to say any more about the characters themselves because, like I said above, I don't want anything to be revealed. One thing I do have to say though is Gillian Flynn knows character development. There was absolutely no room for questions in her character building. If I wondered about something... it was soon answered. She had those characters, theirs flaws, theirs personalities perfected to a tee.<br /><br />The story was absolutely astonishing. I knew there was a twist going in. By the time I read this, it was out for so many months and had already been voted a pick for 2012 so I knew there was a twist but I had no idea it would take it to the level it did. I heard Gillian Flynn was an amazing thriller author but really? Those words don't even compare... I didn't expect half of what happened in Gone Girl.<br /><br />I absolutely adored Gillian Flynn's writing style. I cannot even pinpoint what it is, but there is something about her writing that just completely sucks you in. Upon finishing Gone Girl I went and bought her other two books... I heard they were even more mind-blowing than this one, which must be a lot.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought the ending dragged on a bit. When there was about 25 pages left I found myself wondering where it was going to finish... and I could almost guess how it was going to end(but not entirely!).<br /><br />All in all this was an amazing thriller. I am finding it really hard to get into adult books lately, I find they are really draggy but this was the completely opposite, I didn't want to put it down. I know this review doesn't really say much about the book but if you have read it you will know why I am being so vague. Just pick it up... I doubt you will be disappointed
B00AJLHUYO|3.0|\\"Do you understand what you've done this time? The kind of jeopardy you've put your children in? Your marriage?\\" Ellison Oswalt (Hawke) is a true crime author doing research for his next book. Wanting to be as accurate as possible he moves him and his family into a house where the crime took place. He finds \\"snuff\\" films in the house and begins to watch them when he notices a strange figure in each of them. The more he sees the more terror his family goes through. I will start be letting you know what kind of movies scare me. To me Poltergeist is the scariest movie but I also watched it when I was like 8. Recently the Exorcism of Emily Rose and Insidious really scared me. I say that to tell you that this movie didn't really scare me like I expected. The movie is more psychological then horror but it does have some definite scary parts to it. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I was thinking it was going to be scarier then it was. I would compare the horror in this to the Shining more then any other movie. Overall, not bad but I expected something different, more scary. I did like the ending though. I give it a B-.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Terrific storytelling. It's a techno puzzle with mid teen humor and a semi-Neanderthal swear word collection. Great fun. Something's wrong with the spell checker though. Or the proof reader was drunk.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|I mean.....It's Hiromi!! What can one expect? I've watched it several times, it's still beautiful and amazing, although sometimes scary, vertiginous and frightening.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and interesting with the different characters<br />I play on this game nearly everyday and it never gets boring. I discovered this game from a friend.
B008JF8O9M|3.0|I have a brother printer on my computer and a Lexmark network printer.<br />The app says it won't Work for my printers, and it doesn't.<br />Not much else I can say about it
0345803485|5.0|I had so much fun reading the 3 books that I got a bit obsessed with it.<br />I have joined all the groups on Facebook and followed the stories regarding the upcoming movie.<br /><br />I won't say the writing is good, but not all light reading needs to be enlightening right?<br /><br />On the other hand many women might find the topic enlightening indeed. It does open your eyes to a whole new world worth exploring.<br />While in the end it is what we all want: A LOVE story! it mixes it all up with a bit of spanking.<br /><br />Speaking of spanking... In my 50 shades of obsession I found a fun little App that fueled my passion for the book. Don't know if its available for Android, but here is the link for iPhone.[...] It's called 50 SHADES OF SPANK<br /><br />Enjoy the book! I certainly did
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I have another of their CD's- they are mellow and the singer has a nice voice.  I am quite pleased with the CD.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I LOVED THE SMALLVILLE SERIES AND WAS GLAD TO HAVE RECEIVED THE 10TH SEASON SO VERY QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. THANK YOU.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome !! You get to do every thing but only a little difference. There is not every thing like in regular minecraft but it has every thing you need to play.
B009UNH0EM|4.0|It's quite short, but that's how they advertise it. Not exactly shocking. Which is good from a charging cable, I suppose.
B005CRQ4OW|2.0|Incredibly good book and has life experiences I love the book because it is hilarious the book was so goo d I read it in 2 days
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I didn't expect much from this title, however it was a pleasant surprise. On the romantic side, (hey it's almost Valentine's Day!) but never boring.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|I don't know how I missed this at the box office, but I really enjoyed the film.  Sure, parts of the plot are a stretch.  But show me an action/adventure that doesn't stretch it and I'll show you a boring film.  The best part of this film was the lack of swearing and lewd behavior or attire, over-the-top violence and gore.  I watched this movie with my 15y old daughter and 12y old son and had nothing to be embarrassed about. They loved it. The acting was good, the cinematography outstanding, the characters likeable, non-conflicted and fun.  The only knock I could give this was the soundtrack - some of the tunes seemed out of place for the movie, however the Clint Mansell song played throughout the movie and at the closing credits was perfect, and addicting - I have been whistling it ever since.  I wish there were more movies like this the family could enjoy together.
B00488WPRQ|3.0|Worth the watch, better to see on premium channel.  Interesting twist on death penalty; however more significant how the dark cloud follows main character as would be in reality.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's even more exciting than the first.  I have a hard time putting it down.  I always feel so accomplished when I level up hahaha.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The series started a little slow, but picked up about halfway through the season. It lays the foundation for the next season. Which runs at a much faster pace. A strong 4 star!
B005544V6A|5.0|I started watching Suits during Season 2, but was curious how the show began. I'm really glad that I went back and watched the Pilot. It gives me much better insight, knowing how these characters and relationships began.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out as this was an excellent read. I definitely would recommend to anyone who likes the hunger game series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. You can do lots of cool things. I highly recommend this app. It feels so real.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I find this movie different and very interesting.  I think the idea is really thought provoking and the acting is really great.  I like the unconventional style of the photography.  This is a movie I will watch over and over.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great end to this story.  This adventure was fun and kept me spellbound. As hard as I try, I cannot pick one of the thee books that is bettter then the other.  The whole set meshed so good that there was no choice but to read all three books.<br />After my granddaughter and I talked about the 1st book and how I much enjoyed the the 2nd  & 3rd books she decieded to do the same and was not dissappointed.  However she did like the 2nd book the best. Thetre is no best for me.  .<br />Once you start it is hard to stop.  Loved it!!
B004XZR63M|5.0|I'm used to the old strategy of work hard, save where you can, and if you get a really good paying job, you can invest in mutual funds.  I had no idea my house was a liability.  I really didn't know much about protecting my money from predatory taxes.  Since reading this book, I have gone on to read the rest of the Rich Dad series; and once you understand the whole ball of wax that Mr. Kiyosaki has to offer, you will truly be richer than you ever were before!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|makes me miss my horses!! it brings back memories of me cleaning the barn as a child!  I gotta get back to the country aka my roots!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Same fun as templerun but with kids...cops...and trains....ahh the memories! I can recommend this game for all ages to waste a day away.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I only have the free version right now, but will definitely buy the extended version.<br />I do not like ho only games and the puzzles so far have been fairly easy, but fun.  I can hopefully find more similar to this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I recommend it to Romantics and History buffs!  I would watch it every night if I could.  Very nice escapism!
B005VPRET4|5.0|My daughter loved this!  It has different foods that are fun to play with and the colors are awesome.  She put it together right away.
B001223BLU|5.0|i got the very bestof frankie valli and the 4 seasons...i love the old classics..thats what you call good music...but you will lenjoy listening to this album...many memories come back from my youth...
B0086700CM|5.0|great graphics and very responsive - monkeys are a little creaky though. sound effects are kind of fun. good game
B004H4XLRE|5.0|We bought this for my son for his birthday and he loves that he can make his cars race all by himself.  He is only 2 so can't pull the lever back yet however he can push the button to make them go which is his favorite part anyways!
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|Im super excited but the date changes keep letting me down on the days that I'm wearing my Rammstein T-shirts but all in all I know it will eventually be here and it will be so worth it
B000KIPT30|5.0|I don't know how will things go on the long run since I just received this product but so far I love it.  My headphones sound so much better now and it doesn't degrade the sound at all as some people here has  mentioned, in fact I can hear a substantial improvement.  All in all it's excellent and the build quality feels very solid.  Also the power connector feels very sturdy not loose at all.  For the price you can't beat it plain and simple...now!! this makes me wonder how those really expensive high end head phone amps with vacuum tubes sounds like.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app for keeping my Bible with me at all times.  I love that I can choose from so many different versions.  The only complaint is the Bible is not available when you do not have data or wi-fi connections.  This is not a problem if you use this on a phone, but it is if you have it on a tablet or other Android device that depends on wi-fi.
B004OYUNTG|3.0|Really impressive, nice looking watch, teeming with features.  However it's way too big for me (6' with thinnish wrists).  If you have big thick wrists, this would be a cool watch.<br /><br />I wish they hadn't added the useless bezel with the text, and instead made the watch case smaller.  But it's quite complicated so maybe this was as light as they could make it.<br /><br />I might have kept it despite this but the backlight is pretty bad!  It's not like an Indiglo backlight, it's a sort of dim yellowish light that illuminates the hands only.<br /><br />I ended up returning it.
B002JWD6AS|2.0|I have to offer context for my review.  I am an adult - not a teenager - so that may be why I didn't like this one.  I try to read books geared toward young adults because I have two daughters and want to know what they are reading.  I think it was a fine story for them - nothing off the wall crazy, but there didn't seem to be enough character development or depth for me, personally.  I have also read Twilight and I instantly connected with the characters - who doesn't remember young love?  I think any author should be honored for getting pen to paper and Ms. Stiefvater is talented.  There just seemed to be missing something on how these two characters really came to know each other.  It felt like were instantly inseparable after no awkwardness or getting to know each other.  It was as if something in the beginning was skipped.  Just my two cents.
B007N85POS|4.0|It's very interesting that the birds collaborated with the Rio gang. The game's style is very good and is an entertaining play.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Played very well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, screen will enlarge to find items easier, story line is great (if you like spooky, as I do).  I really did enjoy this game and recommend it, price not bad.  Waiting for Part 2.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|It's very different from the previous games and has good graphics. Sadly the game has poor controls and the camera angles are bad. Still it's a fun game but not as addicting as the others.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I didn't even finish watching the movie, but then, I've never really been into Batman. Take or leave it? Leave it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has so much to offer, it's not only about the great sex but about two people who over come so much. I would greatly recommended this book to anyone. My only regret is not reading it sooner.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I've never seen a male strip tease act, but if it's anything like this, I'M GOING! Channing Tatum is awesome, body and moves! All the guys are super hunks!I will see this again, hell, I might even BUY this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the first of what I hope to be engaging additions to my new tablet. There are many more items to be looked into when I progress into familiarization with this new toy.
0439023491|4.0|[Day of the reaping] Effie says ladies first Prim Rose Everdeen I volt ear Katniss says. Looks like we have a volunteer. Now for the boys Peeta Mellark. The tributes for district 12. May the odds be ever in your favor Cattiness and Peeta are forced to go into arena to fight to the death till one tribute remains.<br />I really like this book because it has a lot because it has a lot of action. I think this book is good for age's throe 8 and up. I would recommend this book to your friend because it has really good details. It feels like you are in the book/movie. I would read the book then see the movies. Because people say it is easer to understand.<br />In the end Cattiness and Peeta are at the cornucopia. There are dogs chancing them Cattiness and peeta. Cattiness realizes that the dogs are the dead tributes will they live or not?
B008S4YZCO|3.0|The game is a lot of fun and there are several ways to interact with your monsters and lots of side activities and things to buy, however, the money you earn in game to purchase things is mostly useless and they want you purchase special coins with real money if you really want to be able to play the game consistently. Otherwise, you are limited to a small number of monsters and buildings and accessories you can purchase and are limited to basically to one 30 second &#34;battle&#34; a day because your monsters take literally hours to recover (unless you pay the fee to skip the recovery time).<br /><br />Bottom line, unless you plunk down some real money (at least $10-20 worth) you can only play it for a few minutes a day before you run out of activities and battles you can do while you wait for required amount of time to pass.<br /><br />I wish they had a $4 or $5 version that didn't require additional investment. Maybe something that speeds up or eliminates the required amount of time that has to pass and let you accrue at least some of the other in-game currencies necessary to advance.<br /><br />Oh, and one final gripe. They set you to doing several tasks to advance in the game and one group of them revolves around interacting with other Monster Farms that you connect with via their network or Facebook. This feature NEVER works and it always tells me there are no other users around to connect with. So if you want to advance in the game and complete these tasks....you guessed it, you have to pay for it with their special currency.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is the first book of three in the series. The Hunger Games is about 12 districts after war. The hunger games is a game were a male and female from each district at the ages of 12-18 will be chosen to go into a arena and fight to the death until only 1 person living. If you win the games you get a year supply of food and you and your family will get to live in the victors village. The main characters are a boy and a girl, Peeta and Katniss, who live in district 12 have met before and Peeta has never forgotten about the day they met. Peeta and Katniss go into the hunger games but, only one person comes out alive right?<br /><br />I think this is a great book! I recommend that if you don't like violence that this may be a little intense for you. Other than that the book is great and suspenseful! I hope that you read this book and enjoy it as much as I did! Read it you'll be glad you did!!
B000IZXR20|5.0|Very good clasic scary movie.  I love the special effects in this movie, and the excitement at seeing the creeper in motion doing business.
0385737955|5.0|What would you do if you woke up in a box and had no memory? Thomas wakes up in a cold, hard, metal box with no memory of his past life, with about 60 teenagers looking down at him. He soon finds out that he is living in a maze with a bunch of kids that have no memory like him. The maze is filled with blubbery-machine type monsters, that the kids call greivers. One touch from a greiver will put you in a coma. When Thomas and the rest of the kids think they have found the way out, the greivers come after them. Will Thomas and his new friends find a way out, or die?<br /><br />I loved this book because James Dashner (the author) had the action start right away. I also liked this book because of all the mix of genres the book had with were action, adventure, mystery, and a tiny bit of romance. This book was smooth and it molded together perfectly. Again, I loved the book \\"The Maze Runner\\" by James Dashner, and I think you should read it too
B000AMPZF8|4.0|I absolutely love Muse. This is probably my second favorite album besides The 2nd Law. The delivery was speedy, but was handled poorly (cracked case). No big tho, I didn't buy it for the case!
0545265355|5.0|In the country of panem or in the ruins of North America The Hunger Games started. The Hunger Games is where one male and one female from each twelve districts gets called in a public reaping. From there they will go into an arena and fight to the death until one lone victor wins. Katniss Everdeens sister Prim gets called in the reaping but Katniss stands up and volunteers to take her sisters place. She then meets Peeta Mellark who is the male that gets called. And with the help of drunk mentor Haymitch Abernathy Katniss needs to learn the diffrence between life and death. Will she win or will the last thing she hears be the numbers three, two, one.<br /><br />This book gives great suspense and every time you read the book you are always on the edge of your seat. I guarantee you will love this book as much as i did weather you are 9 or 109 you will like it. Once you read this book you can not put it down every time you will just want more. I liked this book because it is action packed and when you read it you feel like you are in the games. Will she win or will her attachments get in the way of her winning.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought the book was well timed for the world we live in and told from a scientist point of view.  The scientific language was difficult for me as a lay person, so to be honest, i skipped through a lot of it, but  focused  on the personal side of the story.  It was very moving.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a good game but some of the games are really hard.others are really stupid. this game is only ok
B0054JZC6E|4.0|You'll never get bored with this crazy plethora of zany games. My personal favorite is the sushi shoot. Its addictive.

B009NT0I06|3.0|Absolute hit! except wrong medium.  I didn't realize vinyl records are back being cool again.  Make  sure you have a way to listen if you want this.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|So far so good, it's challenging for sure but fun! Great time waster, nice graphics. Looks great on the Kindle Fire.

0307352153|5.0|Scan the reviews on this site and you will see that they are much more personal than the standard detached appraisals.  There's a reason.  This is one of those rare books that really can be life-changing if you are an introvert who has struggled against what you thought was a deficiency.<br /><br />It really is just fine if you hate loud parties and would rather read a book;  if you listen more than talk;  if you have a few lifelong friends instead of a thousand-person contact list; if you prefer a four-couple dinner party to a gala; if you were a good student but had no interest in being class president; if you can afford a Lexus but hang onto your battered Camry; if you react especially strongly to music; and if you are endlessly curious and endlessly ruminative.<br /><br />As a matter of social commentary, Ms. Cain's main point is that American culture makes it NOT OK to be these things.  The alpha personality is the standard.  We are held to the Extrovert Ideal.  So a lot of us thought we were deficient, second-rate, even though we had cases full of kudos and awards for quiet accomplishments. We tried to conform to the backslapping, hale-fellow ideal, but it never felt right.  If you are one of us, and have not yet become convinced that you are just fine--more than fine, in fact--then read this book.<br /><br />The science is founded on the research of developmental psychologist Jerome Kagan, who identified \\"high reactivity\\" in infants; and psychologist Elaine Aron, who labeled a roughly similar trait in adults \\"high sensitivity.\\" It simply means, with the literalness that the word implies, that all sensations are more sharply felt.<br /><br />High sensitivity is not identically the same as introversion, but the two are strongly correlated.  And introversion does not at all imply frailty, or even necessarily shyness.  There is a range of introverted personalities.<br /><br /> Most striking to me was the example of Professor Brian Little of Harvard, a hugely popular award-winning lecturer who is so introverted he retreats for the summer to a remote cabin in the Canadian woods.  I, like Little, am an introverted professor who loves to stride on stage and perform, as long as there is quiet time before, to prepare, and after, to recharge. Most introverts will similarly find some reflection of themselves in these pages.<br /><br />My one quibble is that Cain overstates the force of the American Extrovert Ideal, which she calls \\"omnipresent.\\"  Begin with the most successful American of all time, as measured by wealth accumulation:  Warren Buffett, a classic introvert.  There are lots of loudmouth athletes, but the ones we embrace are mostly quiet introverts.  Think of Willie Mays, Henry Aaron, Arthur Ashe.  Likewise movie actors.  James Stewart, Gary Cooper.  Our most revered President, although a great storyteller and courtroom lawyer was, at his core, a brooding introvert.<br /><br />The only generalization about the American temperament is that there is no valid generalization.  We are the embodiment of diversity. The Donald Trumps and Joe Bidens are in our faces a lot, but there is no more congenial place on earth for the poet or the park ranger. And  if there is a single stereotypical image of the American, it is that of the cowboy--solitary, silent, and strong.

B008EEB4TA|5.0|This album is awesome. From my favorite song &#34;How to be a heartbreaker&#34; to other great songs such as &#34;Radioactive&#34; you will find yourself listening to each song over and over again. I love this album!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great from start to finish, I couldn't put it down!!!!!  This is definately a page turner. Probably one of my favorites that I have read out of the romanance section!!!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I am addicted to all of the Diner Dash games.  I just purchased the Cooking Dash Deluxe and it is well worth the 99 cents.  I like the idea that she travels to different restaurants to help out the chefs (along with Granny).  Great fun!  Purchase it for hours of entertainment.
159562015X|1.0|You need to make sure you are getting a new book, otherwise the book becomes worthless.  You have to use the code inside the book to take the assessment....and then finish the book based on your results.  The code can only be used once so if you get a used book, like me, you've wasted your money bc you can't reuse the code.
141694737X|5.0|Love the story, oh yeah, so do the kids.  It's short, nice and easy to ready to the little ones.  They get excited opening up the animals, which are very sturdy and haven't ripped off yet.<br /><br />A must buy for the reading collection.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The Blind Side was entertaining at it's best! Good actors, clean enough for the entire family to enjoy! Sandra Bullock was great! =)
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I absolutely love this item!  I kind of wish I would have gotten the red one, but by my own fault, I got the black one.  It turns out that the black one is just fine.  It keeps my Kindle fire nice and unscratched when I throw it in my bag.  The price was right and I would definitely recommend this item.  Also, I can watch the fire as I am making dinner!  The stand up case comes in very handy!  LOVE, LOVE this product!
0440245915|4.0|By his first novel, Grisham was already in his classic form, somehow making a legal case interesting rather than dry or tawdry while also relishing delving into the Southern small town culture surrounding his cases. There were some awkward spots in the writing, expected for a first work and not too bad. Occasionally he seems to take too much pleasure in using a certain word or describing Jack's and everyone else's drinking. At worst, he sticks too closely to 'write what you know' and ends up doing more of the same later in his career.<br /><br />I really wasn't sure whether he'd get away with it, nice twists with different than expected witness testimony and the reactions thereto.<br /><br />In-character it was plausible that Carl Lee would avoid getting indicted - in a way that made sense in the book to keep things interesting, but on the other hand, it didn't make sense since it would have ended the story too soon.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it made sense for Jack, Harry and Lucien to get away with questionable legal tactics in the name of doing the right thing, although that is just a lesser version of the main plot.<br /><br />Please note that I have never seen the movie version.
B004HYDM0A|3.0|I wasn't really crazy about this movie.  File it under \\"just ok\\".  I had just watched The Imposter, and Catfish just couldn't stand up to that movie.  The trailer is a little misleading, I think.  It makes you believe there is something more sinister happening then just a lonely, isolated lady misrepresenting herself online to a younger man.
0345535421|5.0|(Some general comments about the series were already covered in my \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" review)<br /><br />Overall, this was a continuation of what pulled me in about the first book, as well as an excellent progression of the plotline.<br /><br />Daenerys was already one of my favorite characters; I'm liking her even more as her story in exile develops. (Jon, Tyrion and Sam were already some of my favorite characters for being exiles of a sort)<br /><br />Early on, I particularly liked Chapter 15/Tyrion 3. Not only was his ribald wit on full display, it also made serious points about censorship being counterproductive and the sex-positive culture of the Summer Islands. \\"Tell the High Septon that if I could worship with my cock, I'd be much more religious.\\"<br /><br />Tyrion continues to be the man, both in a serious rule sense and a comic relief sense. Heh, Pycelle is a literal egghead. Some of his middle chapters make interesting points about the sexual culture of Westeros.<br /><br />With Chapter 27/Daenerys, I was happy to see a \\"Daeneyrs\\" header - ooh, more Daenerys. Of note was her comparison of the war wall and the sex wall. I was also particularly happy to see \\"Tyrion\\" headers.<br /><br />Chapter 33/Catelyn 4 was a great in-character explanation of the Faith Of The Seven, one of many examples of Martin's smooth exposition. It seems like a reference to Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. I wonder if some god(s) exist and have actual power as part of the fantasy setting. Also, the failures of Catelyn's diplomacy (in this and her other chapters) seem like a prime example of overaggressive machismo and a sexist refusal to listen to women who are talking sense.<br /><br />I read rumors that Renly and Loras were gay, which the TV show played up. It hadn't crossed my mind, but hindsight is 20/20 and it manes sense. In general, I had noticed a relative lack of that, but figured it was explained by the focus on arranged marriages and heirs and perhaps a difference in Martin's humans. Was Loras the knight totally uninterested in the affairs of women mentioned in the first book? There was a boy whore mentioned, but were his customers male or female? There are more such references peppered throughout the book.<br /><br />I knew sending Littlefinger as an emissary was a bad idea, so I wasn't surprised that we didn't hear back from him. I would have sent Cersei. I understand why Tyrion wnted to stay, since he was apparently the only one in King's Landing with a clue.<br /><br />Chapter 52/Sansa 4: I like Sandor's brutally honest attack on Sansa's naievete, and it continues here. \\"What god would make a monster like the Imp or a halfwit like Lady Tanda's daughter?\\" seems like a great in-character version of the Problem Of Evil, a common anti-religion argument. As for Sansa freaking out about her first period, I'm a guy reading another guy write about that, so I can't say too much. The \\"old enough to bleed, old enough to breed\\" attitude certainly makes things worse. She has an interesting conversation with Cersei afterwards for sure.<br /><br />\\"Septon Utt likes little boys\\" added to the Faith Of The Seven/Catholic Church analogy<br /><br />Tyrion's defenses were brilliant (so that's why he wanted a chain), but I wonder if it was a lost cause anyway without Tywin breaking the siege. It was smart to present the actual battle from both sides (Davos/Tyrion, with Sansa for King's Landing civilians). I saw no serious mistakes on either side that I would have considered plot holes. Chapter 60/Sansa 6 provided more great female-specific debunking of Sansa's naievete from Cersei.<br /><br />We already knew Bran and Rickon were still alive, but it was great to end with a Bran chapter as well as seeing more of Jon towards the end.s a difference in Martin's humans.

B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I use this app frequently. It's fun to mess around and see what you can come up with. Tons of different backgrounds to choose from and utensils to use.
B008N4XC2I|5.0|At first listen to this album I thought Matt had gone mad. I've been following Muse since Absolution. After listening to it more than once I was hooked. It didn't seem to have enough rock to it the first go through, but now I believe it still fulfills that longing. I could never choose a favorite album of theirs because they do change their sound enough and all the albums are so good, but this is by far my favorite Muse album. If you have never seen them live please do so, they are far better than any recording. Cheers!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This makes the old Angry Birds look boring! The different birds you can use on this game makes it a lot more fun!
B009GIPDQS|1.0|And waste of time.  The author explains at the end of the book that he did no research for the story and<br />it certainly appears that he made it up as he was going along,<br />I find it insulting that he would actually admit to that - and expect people to admire his work<br />I actually went to the back of the book to find out if there was a purpose to this story which is told in endless long paragraphs.<br />Perhaps it was supposed to be a surprise ending - but what a flop.<br />Perhaps the problem is that from the beginning I didn't care about the character and lost interest pretty quickly.<br />I can't believe John Grisham actually wrote this -I would have to imagine it was  published on his established reputation - if I had written it I wouldn't even have submitted it never mind expect to have it published.<br />Badly written and badly executed.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Have numerous versions and enjoy all of them.  Never hurts to have more than one in case you get tired of one you can do another plus friends have fun with them too.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Ian Rankin doesn't disappoint.<br />Just enjoyed this book so much, I was sad when it was finished.<br />Interesting that he is weaving in the character from The Complaints.
B004Y042N8|5.0|Challenging and different from a lot of this type of game.  Makes u think and figure different ways of accomplishing the game.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|Just an all around great movie, has great action, humor and of course Arnold, What more do you need? Everyone needs to see T2
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Bought the digital download for my wife! She loves the album.<br />The sound quality is excellent! I have burned it to a CD and put it on her mp3 player. This is how you sell music!
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|I only saw this movie because of Helen Hunt's Oscar nomination. I didn't know much about it other than the main plot and was certain it would be hard to watch. As it was, the brilliant performances by both Helen Hunt and John Hawkes made this movie accessible.
1616550414|5.0|As a massive Zelda fan, I cannot believe how great this book is for the price.  20 bucks and free shipping as a prime member makes this a total no-brainer.  I do wish the book focused more on the earlier Zelda games that I grew up with, but the artwork and chronological order are great.  Just a great value for the price.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Denzel's performance couldn't save this movie. The ending is condescending and unbelievable. I think the only reason this movie has gotten any attention is because Hollywood loves an actor playing drunk.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Awesome movie! Great for the whole family! It has lots of humor for everybody and a lot of very upbeat music!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Absolutely amazing i think I'm in love!!!!<br />Everyone needs this book!!!!!!!!<br />Praise the mark if Athena!!!!!<br />What will happen to Percy?!?!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an amazingly wonderful game that gives you the experience if csring for a horse it is by far the best pet simulator game I have played in a very long time.
B008745B32|4.0|It took more than a few chapters for this book to capture my interest.  It finally did, and now I look forward to my quiet reading time whenever I can get it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found this book on a kindle listing and hoped for the best. I love this book. I finished it in one sitting. I could not stop reading about Hazel and Gus. It can be categorized as sad or simply a love story but I saw it as an insightful view into the eyes of the someone facing death and sickness.
0061564893|5.0|It is amazing to read some thing to keep your attention chapter by chapter. Details shown just help you to imagine the context of the global picture. Now I´ve understood why many extremely posite and some very negative comments about this book. It is controversial, but finally very interesting. Totally recommendable.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|I didn't like it because it took too long to worm out the puzzles . Evan when I tried for an hour it was wrong and I am pretty good at puzzles.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this app, but the only thing is trying to unlock people with the character boxes things. Other then having to have a lot of things just to unlock a person, I love it and would reccomend it to a friend, family member, even an enemy! Get it now!!! :)
B007W7P5L8|5.0|This cover is just like the pictures and description have portrayed it to be. I love that it comes in purple. :)
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love the story line with its beautiful scenery, the secrets it held, and puzzles to solve.<br />I recommend any one who loves to find objects,solve puzzles and be bedazzled by the story and<br />Scenery.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Never boring. Catches your attention right away! Have fun reading all three. Impossible to read just one :-)
B0086213XW|2.0|The only reason I didn't give this movie one star was because the acting WAS good.  Acting isn't the problem.  I just felt uncomfortably awkward watching most of the interaction in this movie.  My fiance and I watch our fair share of movies good and bad.  When we are listening to dialogue and are like \\"what?!\\", the movie isn't that great.  At one point, we decided that watching other couple's inside jokes and silly, weird conversations just isn't as much fun as having our own together.  I generally don't mind nudity in movies when it has a purpose, but the women's locker room scene was unneeded to me.  It served no purpose to the plot of the movie but to only be \\"daring\\" and \\"artsy\\".  I definitely won't be recommending this to anybody as much as I wanted to like it because I really like the cast.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|Even their fans are calling it one of their best productions ever... Celebrating 25 years since their debut album, Swing Out Sister releases PRIVATE VIEW on Shanachie Entertainment, featuring intimate, jazzy, acoustic versions of their most popular songs as well as newer material! This exciting, new collection is a re-imagining of Swing Out Sisters' best including \\"Incomplete Without You,\\" \\"Am I the Same Girl,\\" and \\"La La (Means I Love You)\\"! Plus TOKYO STORIES, their live, full length concert DVD of Swing Out Sister performing in Japan with extras included, such as exclusive scenes of the band backstage as well as sightseeing in Tokyo. This British, sophisticated pop band has always held a special place in our hearts with their unique, jazzy stylings and world class, musical standards. We highly recommend this cool new album and DVD and suggest you download it immediately and visit their website for their Facebook connections to stay in touch! Swing on!
B006RBZV82|5.0|This is a beautiful movie of the wonders of deep sea creatures.  Narrated by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, this IMAX film is gorgeously filmed with breathtaking images of the deep ocean.  It was fascinating to watch these creatures engaging in their normal activity (hunting for food, hiding from predators, maintaining a symbiotic relationship, etc.).  Excellent film!
0345803485|5.0|A really great book, cant wait to read the other two books. Might even watch the movie when it comes out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this for public library books and have three android devices that I switch between with the Kindle app you can sync and switch between devices without having to search for your place.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought this book was wonderful and showed another side of war most people don't get to see. RIP Chris Kyle
B00846REIS|4.0|At first I was apprehensive  when Gideon and Eva first met and she fell over. ( Ana fall into Mr gray office)  Eva friend/roommate's last name. ( Taylor)  and the idea that Eva been a submissive and of course the nightmare of Gideon. Etc. That been said I enjoyed the story it took less than 2days to complete reading. I just could not put the book down. Will definitely read the next book just to see where or how this drama Will end  hope more than 3 books.  Great sexual overtones. Not kinky faculty. But hot nonetheless. Lol.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i never really got into angry birds, but i do like this one. maybe its freeing the little trapped birds thats more rewarding. anyway its fun
B00846F1YW|5.0|Easy to play, I love hidden object games and this is xxx a good one. The definition is excellent, the dialogue can be a bit boring but you can easily tape through it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed the gripping continuation from book 1. The way each character expands and grows pulls you in and on to book 3.
1609611543|3.0|I love bread.  I eat cereal for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch, and pasta for dinner.  Even when I lost 100 pounds, I simply switched from white bread to whole grain bread.  I still have a &#34;wheat belly&#34;.  This book made me reconsider my eating habits.<br /><br />Not only does Dr. William Davis believe that wheat is the culprit of the obesity epidemic facing America, but he also believes that it causes a rash of concerns such as diabetes, colitis, high cholesterol, skin conditions, and inflammation.  He provides numerous case studies and examples of people who improved these conditions simply by eliminating wheat.<br /><br />I would like to caution certain readers.  Dr. Davis is a purist, which means that he advocates a grain-free life.  He stresses that replacing wheat with corn, potatoes or rice will not improve a person's life.  While he does provide a few recipes, his suggestions might be too extreme for those who love their grains.<br /><br />This book is written for the advocates, but also for the nay-sayers.  I know people with gluten allergies, but have not been interested in following their diet.  While I am still not convinced that wheat is the root of dietary evils, this book did inspire me to experiment.  I have avoided cereal, bread, and pasta for two weeks.  It's too early to tell whether I will be able to maintain this long term.  The point is: this book inspired me to try.<br /><br />If you're interested in learning more about how wheat impacts your body, and are willing to keep an open mind about what you eat every day, then this book is for you!<br /><br />Update 10/16/17 I lasted about a month as a GF girl. Went back to wheat. Since then, I have experimented with grain-free living, and now have settled on no corn, soy, almonds and less wheat. Eliminating any particular food should always be done while honoring what caused you to begin in the first place. My dietary changes have nothing to do with weight, and everything to do with sensitivities.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved it and as always developed characters that you seem to have met somewhere sometime.  A love story with a historical touch
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I love this case! I was unsure when ordering that it would be what I wanted, but now that I see it I'm happy I ordered it. Great size, sturdy plastic, and easy (but not to easy) to open
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good! I had to keep turning the pages, reading on and on.  I like the detail that the author uses and the depth of the story. You have to actually think about the deeper meaning and connect the dots.  I did not like, however, how the ending is all thrown together and over in about 5 pages...<br />It made me feel as though the writer got tired of dragging out the plot and suddenly had to tie it together and end it.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Thanks Great Thanks GreaT tHANKS gRThaThanks Great Thanks GreaT tHANKS gRAET nks Great Thanks GreaT tHANKS gRAET AET Thanks Great Thanks GreaT tHThanks Great Thanks GreaT tHANKS gRAET ANKS gRAET
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Did not expect it to take the direction it did. I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Would not watch it again.
1439196834|5.0|Xmas gift for my 16 year old grandson. He is thrilled with it. Has already been using some of the suggestions in the book!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Ryan has successfully created a world that I feel engaged and immersed in.  It's vaguely similar to the mistborn series as an alternate reality, and every bit as difficult to put down. I cannot wait for the next!
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|im really disappointed! i guess reading all the 5 star reviews kind of pumped me up for more. I did think it was ok....but it did not bring any tears to my eyes....maybe a few yawns....
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a totally improbable and very funny story of an &#34;escapee&#34; from an old age home.  With no plan in mind our 100 year old man runs into one bizarre situation after another.  The backstory reveals that our &#34;escapee's&#34; whole life has been a series of fortuitous encounters, except for a short stint in a Gulag and a few other brief misadventures.  The 100 year old man is an inspiration to any of us contemplating the shrinking universe of old age.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Very good mail server. Excellant spam control.Very easy to navigate and excellant home page setup.<br />no problems for about 7 years.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I love Stephen King and have read so many of his books.  This one was another in a long line of  his great stories.  He has such a wild imagination.  He takes you right out of this world and then slams you back in.<br />This story is about a boy who wants to be with his older brother and his friends; but his brother won't let him because he thinks he's too young to do the things they do.  Well he'll show them!  He go exploring on his own and find something awesome; then they'll wish they would have been with him.<br />What happens will make them wish that alright, if they believe him.<br />A must read short story.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|I still love this movie after all this time, funny, quirky horror movie: what more could you ask?  I found Nightmare befor xmas boring, wish Burton would make more things like this.  Might be too scarry for very young children with ghosts and dead people etc. but it's mostly a comedy.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|This movie was a delightful surprise! If you like quirky or unique, this movie is it. Kinda reminds me of a more lighthearted Coen Bro.'s movie. Enjoy the dialogue and cinematography, both are strengths here. Loved Bruce Willis' cop role here, a play off of his past roles, I felt. Sit back and enjoy, don't take it too serious, and remember what it was like to be a 12 y/o.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a good game get a lot of stuff with it good game so yes it is a really really really really good game
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|...but well done. From the trailers I was thinking this movie would be more about the character dealing with the fame and attention of pulling off a crash landing where many live were spared. It was actually more of a character study of an alcoholic. Given that, it was well done. Had it been marketed from that angle I am not sure it would have had as broad appeal. Denzel gives a good performance, pulling off yet another character that is outside the typical type for him. Summing it up, it is worth watching but be aware it is much less about the plane, or, &#34;Flight&#34; and more about the pilot's demons.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I don't often play hidden object games as they don't have enough variety and most are not more than a few puzzles long. This one however does have a substantial amount of puzzles - which is great. The music is nice as well. The scenes are also very well done and I like the variation on the puzzles. It definately takes the monotony out of just searching the scene.<br /><br />With all that said, the reason I have given this game 3 stars is because there is a severe lack of variety in the the scenes themselves. Each chapter has more than one puzzle associated with that chapter and all of the parts take place in the same scene for that chapter. Eventually in the story you go back to that scene again so you end up playing the same background at least twice.<br /><br />The other thing that I disliked about the game, and this is likely just because of the nature of the platform that it is played on. There are a couple puzzles that take part in the dark so you have to move a flashlight around to find the hidden items. Because you control the movements of the flashlight with your finger (or stylus,) it counts as misclicks or random tapping. I think it would be much better if you had to tilt your tablet/phone in order to move the flashlight.<br /><br />For the most part though, this is a good game. If you need something to help you pass some time where you wont need a lot of brain power, this is a great choice for that.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I would have given this game a 5 star rating as I have really enjoyed building my rather extensive zoo. However I found obtaining friends to play along with for some time difficult to do.  instructions for this didn't seem to work well with my Kindle Fire.  it was in a rather lengthy manner that I finally figured out on my own and no help from Gameloft how to do this.  And just last night my zoo disappeared completely and started over from the very beginning.  And I was just about to buy my second nursery too.  This is a glitch that needs to be fixed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the most amazing game in the world I post this game every day for about 5 hours I love this game that is why I rate it a 5.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy the solitaire card game!  Especially when I just need something to do after a hard day at work and unneeded to unwind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard this book was a teen book..I am sure it is but I thought it was a good read for adults as well. Wonderful and quick!
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Great songs from first to last. Heavier subject matter than you expect from the first listen. You'll want to keep this whole album on rotation. Best album of the year. I have this album on vinyl as well and Its just amazing as compared to the download. A little hard to find but if you love this album, you haven't really heard it until you spin the vinyl. Enjoy!
B0058VW36U|4.0|My 6 year old can do the easier games.When it gets too complicated, she can't do them.<br />Need more kids games.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is a very addicting game... though sometimes it freezes and messes me up and i hate that. it might work out for other devices though.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|This movie was totally cool! I loved every minute of it right down to the parts that I cried through! I would also consider adding this movie to my library.<br />it was wonderful and i would rent it again! robin williams is always fabulous to watch, He is a hilarious person with style and beauty!<br />Cheyenne StarHawk
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Elder sign is really a lite version of Arkham Horror. If you enjoy board games or want to try board games, Elder Sign is a great way to start. This app is great because you can try the advanced board game feel by yourself to see if it's for you.
B0037VNX44|1.0|WTH I just wasted my time on that??? Awful story don't get the point of making a movie about this guy. It's stupid.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game. I've enjoyed all of the modes and love the gameplay. It has lots of replay value. It's a good bang for your buck.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a fun read with flawed characters who will continue to surprise you throughout the story.  The story written in two voices (his and hers) is a great read that is fun without being cheesy and complex without giving the reader a headache.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a lot of fun to play and take care of your pet horse!! Your parents don't even need to know you bought a horse!lol I enjoy it and encourage you and your friends to get this app
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A great young adult read that can certainly be enjoyed by the not-so-young adult crowd.  Life is complex and these characters take on a tougher than usual &#34;coming of age&#34; experience.  A great read- although I found the characters to be a bit too sophisticated to be completely believable (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but still an enjoyable read for teenagers and adults.
B009GXHOW4|1.0|I was a chump getting this app and I'm 8 and I thought it would good because all the reviews were good
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great read, but hated the ending! It left too much to the imagination. Would have loved more of a resolution.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It is not my favorite Diary of a Wimpy Kid but it's still good. I don't think it's as funny as the others.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an awesome game that everyone should be able to enjoy. This game has whole new levels and exiting courses to get your hand eye coordination to the maximum you can have it.
B004NIFK9Q|4.0|If you are a fan of British classics, this is worth your time to read.  My only complaint with this Kindle version is that there were some words missing (articles and prepositions),  But this did not take away from the gist of the sentence. But the missing words were my only reason for not giving this book five stars.
B0094M2HM4|4.0|Good movie, I enjoyed the music a lot. Husband really liked it and bought it through amazon instant video. Would recommend.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have read this book many times. If you have not read it,  do yourself  a favor and download it and read it now.  Don't wait for Christmas<br />The Kindle version is easy to read..
B002LAM7PI|2.0|It pulls one in out of curiosity, but then it takes an ugly twist which is too hard for adults to understand, let alone children. I would say it has been influenced by bad, negative forces we can't see - demonic.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I know, I know, another Nicholas Sparks book. But i love them all. All his books have the same premise, more or less, but they all get to you anyway. Cute story. I read it a few years ago and decided to reread since the movie is premiering soon. Definitely worth reading.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Lots of fun, and the kids loved it. They watch it at least once a week and never seem to tire of it.
B005544V6A|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show! Acting is AMAZING, story line is great! Suits kills it every time. Gabriel Macht and Patrick Adams are wonderful together. MUST SEE!!!!

B000F6IOC0|5.0|Vampires fighting werewolves.  Plenty of action, comic book style plot, really hot main actress out kicking butt.  That pretty much sums it up.
020530902X|4.0|I honestly don't know anything about this book.<br />I bought for my daughter who needed it for college.<br />It's easier to buy textbooks from Amazon.<br />The price was right, but the shipping cost half as<br />much as the book.

B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The depth and level of realism that Wilde is able to infuse into the characters is almost unbelievable.

B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is absolutely stunning! The graphics are truly what dreams are made of. The game itself is utterly addicting, but not so much that you feel that you can't put it down for a moment.I am so fortunate to have found this game while it is being offered for free! Still, after playing for even a few minutes I would gladly pay full price. I've not had this game for even an hour, but I can say with all honesty that it is without a doubt my favorite game on my Kindle Fire. I saw one review on here saying that it's not compatible with the 7&quot;, but I have had not one problem with it so far! I really can't say enough about this game! I give it a billion stars out of five! :)

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Poor Ms. Boyle didn't know what hit her when she got so famous so quickly, and thus to see her make a live appearance is to witness a deer in a dress and lipstick caught in the headlights and wishing you'd just kill her with minimal fuss and teasing and be done with it.<br /><br />Here, behind the microphone and unencumbered by the distractions of an audience, is where she flies.<br /><br />And in this case, to great heights we've missed seeing her hit lately.<br /><br />Kudos. A wonderful collection.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoy a well developed character.  In this, the first of three, she introduces the characters slowly, we know Christian Grey is flawed, we know Anastasia Steele is far too curious for her own good and lacking the empathy that the rest of us feel for this broken man.  She asks inappropriate questions at the worst possible moments.  But we like her anyway.  The book is predictable...we all knew it would end with a break-up...but still enjoyable.  It's fun, fast, seriously sexy and in some places LOL hilarious!  Enjoy!!!
B003QS9TKU|5.0|And as a 46 year-old baby, I wanted (nay... DEMANDED) three things:<br /><br />Fleece Pajamas; a bowl of soup (OK, mac and cheese, but I didn't want to sound like a pig) the size of my HEAD; and THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />One of my favorites from childhood (I saw it first run when it premiered, right around the corner from where I now live, at the fabled Radio City Music Hall) I didn't think twice before searching for it and clicking \\"Heck Yeah!\\" on the RENT IN HD FOR 48 HOURS button, and kicking back to enjoy.<br /><br />It did not let me down, and is EVERYTHING it was back then.<br /><br />This movie is just... magic. And what's more, it reminds you of what it's like to be young and hopeful and certain the world is full of mystery and amazement. It only takes a few minutes to suck you in, so when the inimitable Angela Lansbury (starring here as a wanna-be mail order apprentice witch living in the outskirts of London at the onset of WWII) sings to one of her young charges that he's \\"At the Age of Disbelieving\\", you can't help but shake your head in agreement and slight pity as you side with her, hoping he'll come around and like you, realize what amazing adventures the world holds in store for you.<br /><br />The extra 20 minutes excised from the original theatrical release (it was contractual: Radio City would run premieres with a full-out stage show, and for time reasons films had to fit strict time constraints or they'd just shut the projector or yank the film from the marquee) have been restored here. And considering I was in the fleece pajamas and full of mac and cheese, I didn't miss the stage show one bit, either.<br /><br />If your kids don't love this movie, you're raising them wrong, and shame on you.<br /><br />If you don't love this too, you were never a child and were dropped here from an icy, heartless planet, and you need to get over all the burdens of the world and allow yourself to fall in love with it.<br /><br />I promise you will.<br /><br />Traguna... Macoides... Tracorum... Satis... Dee!... Macoides... Tracorum... Satis... Dee!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Parts of this book drove me nuts.  In the beginning it jumped around quite a lot from the wedding to Europe to Seattle.  The car chase was totally unreal.  I lived in Seattle until recently.  The idea that you could exit the 520 bridge on to I-5 southbound at 95 miles an hour is a joke.  Heck, you can barely do that at 35 miles an hour - it's almost a 90 degree turn!!!!!  People in Seattle say &#34;I-5&#34;  They don't say &#34;the I-5&#34;.  If she'd spent any time there she would know that.  The best part of this book is the middle - the pregnancy confrontation - great argument - the Jack Hyde scene (he's a great bad-guy)  - pretty believable.  I really liked the Christian Grey bit at the end - revealed his thought process and I got a better feel for his fear.  I was disappointed it jumped 2 years and we didn't find out about the trial, the verdict and where the heck Jack is now.  Seemed to lay the ground work for another book - let's all hope so!
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I loved playing this game while in middle school... the combo pack works great with new versions of Windows unlike my old version.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book just doesn't slow down for a minute.  I sat there wondering how anyone could maintain the emotional pace and survive.  Couple of things I didn't like.  The dramatic parts don't ring true.  It's 2013!  Why would anyone care if someone took sex pictures of them?  I mean, sure - it's not pleasant - but I'd probably laugh in Jack Hydes face if he said to me what he said to her in the coffee room.  Blackmail?  Bah!  The idea that he can melt down and return to normal in less than half an hour is ludicrous.  Some of the language is weird.  Who says &#34;consented to be my wife&#34;?  The author is from England so I cut her some slack.  The sex scenes are wonderful.  The development of the characters and the relationship is spot on.  Enjoyable, fast read.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|For people who don't know, Silent Hill is much more than two movies.  It all started out as a game for the Playstation (original) and there's now 7 games.  Even playing through them doesn't reveal everything about the series. It has backstories and history dating back to before the first  colonists arrive in North America. The creater/developes of the game put so much time and effort into creating a huge storyline for the series.  Now, I know people can't just buy all the games and play them to understand where the two Silent Hill games came from. Many people don't have the time either.    [...]    I suggest going to the website above and read all you can about the story/plot, In Order, (It will tell you) to better learn about the series. There's info on Heather AND lots of other characters in the film. In order to fully make a Silent Hill movie with the necessary information and all, they'd have to cut in tons of flashbacks, thus making both films at least 3 hours or more apiece.  Silent Hill is missing quite a bit, but the missing story and all IS there.  Next time a book/game is made into a movie, try reading or doing research on it before downplaying and bashing it because it doesn't contain EVERYTHING explaining it all.  Both films have portrayed Silent Hill like it should be and I am not the only one who feels this way. Either way, it makes a creepy/weird/horror movie.

B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I started watching this series because I heard great things about it, but was originally questioning why everyone liked it.  The first few episodes were interesting, but only okay.  I kept going though, and about halfway through season 1 they got really good.  The story only gets more compelling and enjoyable, with fun cameos like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens.  All in all, I am extremely glad I got into this series.

B0026HKO2E|2.0|I stopped this download rental and deleted it after about 35 minutes. I had watched the orignal Matrix the previous evening, so was in the mood for more of the same.

B005GG0MIS|4.0|This is an eye opening book, revealing many facts previously unknown to even avid history readers.  There was some stuff I knew and some I wasn't interest in, but overall it was well worth a read.  Besides, what's wrong with skimming, when you end up finding gold. Also, I found it hard to detect any political bias on the authors' part.  That truly is refreshing.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Rush's umpteenth album, 2007's \\"Snakes & Arrows,\\" was their first full-length collection of new material in five years. And fans couldn't help but wonder: Could this be the long-lost follow-up to 1976's landmark release \\"2112\\"? Not exactly, because the Canadian prog-metal exports simply are not the instrumentalists that they used to be. But they all definitely still have plenty of musical chops, as witnessed by Geddy Lee's inventive bass work, Neil Peart's steady drumming, and Alex Lifeson's positively exceptional guitar playing. The group's songwriting is still superb, too -- instead of just piling together a hodgepodge of riffs and/or a handful of good ideas, they craft full, epic songs with memorable parts. So, in the end \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is a thoroughly very enjoyable and rock-solid new album, even if it comes just a little bit short of living up to Rush's early/glory days.<br /><br />\\"Spindrift\\" is the obvious standout of the bunch, as it is far-and-away the set's heaviest song. It builds really well, starting from a harmonic intro (with noteworthy bass work) followed by a twangy-sounding guitar part. And from there, it gradually gains momentum and energy until the crescendo climaxes with some Black Sabbath-inspired doom metal riffs. \\"Spindrift\\" then proceeds to end on a melodic note, as it tosses in an odd melodic guitar break before winding down. With that said, though, \\"Main Monkey Business\\" does offer up a fair share of competition to the above-described song, as it is an almost entirely instrumental number, and one that boasts an epic scope. It begins as a bouncy, funky, heavy rock number with booming, bottom-heavy floor-tom thudding before adopting sweetly soaring backing vocals (complete with memorable vocal hooks), funky, slapped bass lines, and punching, staccato guitars. From there, \\"Monkey\\" proceeds to revolve around one central melody and groove, of which the bass is mostly responsible for (there is a pulsing, pulsating bass throb prominently heard throughout). But this expansive, six-minute-long centerpiece also features some harmonic, choral-tinged backing vocals, a splash or two of colorful acoustic guitar strumming, and a deft, thundering drum beat. And there are some heavy, Led Zeppelin-esque riffs thrown into the mix, here, too.<br /><br />But there are plenty of other highlights to be heard, here, too, even if none of them quite stack up to those two. Opener (and lead single) \\"Far Cry,\\" for example, has a noodling acoustic guitar intro before succumbing to heavy, pounding electric guitars and steadily flowing, humming bass work. The vocals, here, are soaring and harmonized, and include some infectious \\"ooh\\" sing-song-y refrains. But no matter how strong this melodic singing may be, it is almost over-shadowed by the drum fill that closes the song. And it flows directly into the proceeding \\"Armor And Sword,\\" which begins with a bouncy, crashing drum intro followed by pretty acoustic guitar harmonies. And the rest of the tune proceeds to marry a solid, grumbling bass line (that bubbles up from the bottom) with good, Ozzy Osbourne-ish clean singing and a hummable melodic guitar lead. There is a slight  tempo change near the end, taking the song into speedier territory, but some more delightful guitar harmonies and well-placed keyboard flourishes make sure things don't get too out-of-control or heavy.<br /><br />And found elsewhere, \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" is an epically sweeping, stadium-sized power ballad with gorgeous, harmonized arrangements (including the brief use of what-sounds-like flamenco guitar plucking). And the use of catchy clean backing vocals and irresistible, sing-along refrain make sure that this song is truly unforgettable. Then comes \\"Larger Bowl,\\" another power-ballad of sorts that is long on more accomplished clean singing, only this one is leavened with crunchy guitar and bass riffs. And it anchors a beautiful melodic guitar solo with one of Neil's famously crashing, bottom-heavy drum beats. Track seven, \\"Way The Wind Blows,\\" works similarly, beginning with a deft drum solo followed a crystalline, keyboard/flute-sounding solo, and tossing in periodic spots of wailing guitar leads and solos. Some warm, supple crooning, pretty acoustic strumming, and a thumping, AC-DC-like rock `n' roll drum beat are also included, here.<br /><br />\\"Hope\\" might be less-than-two minutes long, but it is nevertheless a standout, as it is an instrumental interlude-type track with a heavenly progressive string arrangement. And \\"Faithless\\" seemingly picks up right where the above left off, thus forming a trilogy of sorts. It features some nice ambiance and stadium-sized sweep and swing, as well as some thoroughly excellent bass work and ginormous, cleanly-sung choruses. And then, it is all capped off by a surprisingly blistering, pure heavy metal-derived shredding guitar solo. And later on, \\"Bravest Face\\" develops a superb friction between its restrained, bass-driven verses and suddenly much louder and crunchier choruses. (One might be tempted to say that it almost takes a page out of the Alice In Chains playbook, but this is far from being a grunge retread.) And nearing the end, the extremely catchy \\"Malignant Narcissism,\\" with its bouncy drum fills and noteworthy bass work (i.e. think jazzy, snaking, warbling bass lines), gives off an almost Red Hot Chili Peppers-esque funk metal vibe. Finally, things wrap up nicely with \\"We Hold On,\\" an appropriately heavy, yet simultaneously tuneful hard rocker.<br /><br />One of \\"Snakes & Arrows'\\" best attributes is its fluidity. Like all great progressive metal/music albums, this one flows very nicely (almost seamlessly, in fact) from the first note of \\"Far Cry\\" until the last second of \\"We Hold On.\\" And there is only one stinker to be found, here -- that one being the vapid \\"Good New First,\\" which never really goes anywhere or gets off the ground, and does little to persuade the listener into thinking it is anything more than just filler. But occasional imperfections aside, \\"Snakes\\" is irrefutable proof of the fact that, even at a ripe old age, Rush can still turn out some of the finest music of their studded, influential career. And how many thirty-something-year old bands can say that?!eats.

B005XT10YS|3.0|\\"The Conspirator\\" is the first film produced by American Film Company established in 2008, and if you watch the film's end credits closely (or visit the company's homepage), you know the new studio is primarily interested in making historically accurate films based on American history.<br /><br />The story itself is an intriguing one. Set in post-Civil War Washington, \\"The Conspirator\\" is about a young attorney Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), who reluctantly defends Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), a boarding house owner who was accused of harboring the men responsible for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Directed by Robert Redford, the film spends considerable time following the change that happens in Frederick, from an indifferent and inexperienced young lawyer to a passionate and dedicated one. His transformation is convincing, largely thanks to James McAvoy's effecting performance, but with courtroom drama that often feels rushed, \\"The Conspirator\\" as a historical drama sometimes seems not really interested in whether Mary is \\"guilty\\" - legally or morally - or not. Some characters like Frederick's friend Sarah Weston (Alexis Bledel) are flat and one-dimensional, making the main plotline a bit melodramatic at times.<br /><br />Most viewers will notice the message from the director (whose previous effort was a political drama \\"Lions for Lambs\\"): a message relevant to the present day, especially the post 9/11 political climate. You will not miss the point, and once you get it, there is not much that will make you think.<br /><br />I really don't know what to say about \\"The Conspirator,\\" of which fact-based plot is certainly intriguing, but the result is rather dry. The film is not preachy or dull, but I couldn't help feeling there is a better approach to make a more emotionally charged film out of this historical material.

It takes up a ton of memory though, almost 300 MB so be prepared to move some other apps around.<br /><br />This is just like many of the Big Fish Games that you can play on your PC. This version is just the beginning, just enough to get you hooked and make the $2.99 full version price tag seem like a steal.<br /><br />It is part story, mystery, hidden object game, and riddle.<br /><br />A great beginning to the rest of the story, [[ASIN:B0097GVJWQ Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek (Kindle Tablet Edition)]].

He and her mother have words and the next thing she knows is the man is dead - stabbed with the cake knife her mother was carrying.<br /><br />The year is 1961 but the book travels back to 1941 and then to 2011 where Laurel is trying to to make sense of her mother's story.  It's a little confusing the way the book travels back and forth in time which is why I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />But eventually the story unfolds at a deadly pace.  It reaches the point where I was as anxious to find the answers as Laurel was.<br /><br />And the twist at the end?  I never saw it coming.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I was really surprised that such a big game could run on my Kindle Fire. But it did and it ran smoothly. It takes up a ton of memory, over 200 MB so be prepared to move some apps around to make it fit.<br /><br />It is like so many of the great Big Fish Games that play on your PC. It is a story, a mystery, hidden object game and all the while, you have to look for clues and objects to continue in your journey.<br /><br />You can play with hints and \\"gleams\\" that help to highlight what you need to do next or what is important. The hidden object screens are not timed (that makes me happy) and you can zoom in with your fingers and scroll around using the touch screen.<br /><br />A lot of play time for a great price. Graphics are good and the challenge is good too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Entertaining enough to keep me on my treadmill for an hour.  Great Charactors!<br />Maggie Smith is the best. Thank you.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I had heard of Fringe but am not much of a regular TV watcher.  When I saw the series was available on Amazon Prime, my husband and I started watching. This show is amazing. The stories (paranormal, extreme fringe science, so time travel, alternate dimensions, etc) are riveting, shocking, scary and ultimately believable.  Anna Torv, the actress who plays the protagonist, is fantastic. She plays a committed, courageous FBI agent willing to put her life on the line many times and she is great. Her foils, Joshua Jackson, the son of the brilliant scientist and the scientist himself are the seedier, funnier characters and provide the wit and humor that Anna's character doesn't show.  We're on Season 2 already and can't wait for the next episode every night.  Highly recommend.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Good productions, good story, well acted.  Well done.  Holmes and Dr. Watson together again in a series.  Make more, please.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|even though I've got enough Stones music to play it for days without playing the same selection twice.  What can I say?  They make great rock 'n' roll and I like it.<br /><br />I also appreciate they didn't put out some super-expensive &#34;collectible&#34; set.  It's basically a pretty straightforward multi-disc greatest hits collection, as if they hadn't provided any already!  The new songs are pretty good, too, and enjoyable for Stones fans.
B0081336FO|5.0|Good productions, good story, well acted.  Well done.  Holmes and Dr. Watson together again in a series.  Make more, please.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend this game highly. It has great graphics and the tutorial was great! Also has a great variety of things to do within the game.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|just good storytelling with a quirky twist....not the same old movie formula.  One of the few movies that I enjoy watching again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book! So glad I read it and didn't see the movie because the trailer looks completely different. The narration is excellent and the subject matter is modern. It is an intimate and fascinating look at a \\"breakdown\\" in our society. Highly recommend.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is fun. I just wish  you can buy land without the cash. It still fun.<br />Try it you might  love it. I like you can find new games before you play yours. Sometimes I just want to play and want to wait.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I wanted to see the movie version of this classic.  It was very entertaining.  All the music is well done - love the Buffalo Bills!
B009738XXM|5.0|This is my new gym music. I like all of the songs except the last song. &#34;You're heart is like a muscle...?&#34; REALLY? Actually, it is a muscle...duh! Anyways, I really enjoy this album. I'd definitely recommend it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Excellent CD that even today, musical and literary, is in effect.However, the history of Silvio Rodriguez is not simply the belated recognition to an enormous talent but a sample of the error committed by a record labels that ignoring the laws that protect the rights of copyright, which plunged the artist in the anonymity and poverty for more than 35 years and deprived the world of what could be a and bright future and successful musical career.Today, there is no money to be able to make up for lost time in Sixtus and for those of us that love their music and their lyrics.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I'm definitely a fan of this album, especially &#34;Push and Shove&#34; and &#34;Settle Down.&#34; It sounds like a new updated version of No Doubt with some hints of Gwen's solo stuff. It also has some lyrical cameos to some of their older stuff that you'll get if you've been a fan for a while. :)
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Adaptations of beloved books are hit and miss most of the time. Many people would say more miss than hit. DC Comics has again dodged what could've been a fatal bullet with \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2.\\" What fans get is a faithful animated feature that captures the spirit of Frank Miller and Klaus Janson's critically acclaimed graphic novel.<br /><br />There's no break for the Dark Knight (Peter Weller) after his defeat of the Mutant leader. Batman is immediately thrown in to a battle with two of his biggest opponents: the Joker (Michael Emerson) and Superman (Mark Valley). The Joker has once again escaped imprisonment and is more obsessed with destroying Gotham City than ever before.<br /><br />At the same time, the Man of Steel has been commissioned by the President of the United States (looking a lot like Ronald Reagan) to put an end to the Caped Crusader's vigilantism. Things get even more complicated when a nuclear missile combined with an EMP detonates and everything electrical shorts out. There are riots in the streets of Gotham and it looks like anarchy may reign supreme. Can Batman and his new army of Batmen get things under control before the city annihilates itself? Can the Dark Knight hold his own in a battle against the Last Son of Krypton?<br /><br />Director Jay Oliva does a standup job of combining Bob Goodman's script and Andrea Romano's casting choices to come up with an action-packed and emotional film that perfectly captures Books Three and Four of Frank Miller's legendary work. There are many parts of this adaptation that follows the novel right down to the printed panel.<br /><br />I'm not saying the animation matches the book to the tee. If that was the case, we might as well just have a motion comic. However, it certainly comes as close as possible without being a carbon copy.<br /><br />I have to hand it to voice director Andrea Romano. She did an excellent job coming up with a top-notch cast for \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2.\\" Peter Weller is superb as an older and angrier Batman / Bruce Wayne. Both Michael Emerson and David Selby give their characters of the Joker and Commissioner Gordon unique flavors we haven't heard before. Emerson does come dangerously close to impersonating Jack Nicholson in some spots, though.<br /><br />The high-definition audio and video quality of \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2\\" could be better. The 5.1 surround sound perfectly distributes the explosions, dialogue, and musical score to the far reaches of your home theater. However, there's quite a bit of horizontal banding to be found in the picture. There's also a strange haze over the animation that I've noticed I get with all DC Universe Animated Movies. It's a bit distracting, but doesn't keep me from enjoying the films ultimately.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2\\" is loaded with some exciting bonus material. Three featurettes entitled \\"From Sketch to Screen: Exploring the Adaptation Process,\\" \\"Superman vs. Batman: When Heroes Collide,\\" and \\"The Joker: Laughing in the Face of Death\\" go behind-the-scenes of the movie and explore the making of the film.<br /><br />Three additional episodes from the DC Vault featuring the Dark Knight are included as well. They are from \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" and \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold.\\" We get extended previews of DC Universe's next animated project, \\"Superman: Unbound,\\" and \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1.\\" It also contains a 4-page excerpt from the graphic novel \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.\\"<br /><br />The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy version of \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2\\" will please fans of the Caped Crusader on all levels. The feature film is an energetic and faithful adaptation of what is considered one of the greatest Batman graphic novels ever written. An abundance of special features gives it greater worth for consumers choosing between which format to buy. I closemy review with one question: \\"Are we ever going to see an animated feature film for 'The Dark Knight Strikes Again?'\\" Feel free to argue amongst yourselves, comic book geeks of all genders.<br /><br />\\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2\\" is available now in Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy, Single-Disc DVD, Two-Disc Special Edition DVD and Digital Download.my review with one question: \\"Are we ever going to see an animated feature film for 'The Dark Knight Strikes Again?'\\" Feel free to argue amongst yourselves, comic book geeks of all genders.<br /><br />\\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2\\" is available now in Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy, Single-Disc DVD, Two-Disc Special Edition DVD and Digital Download.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|OMG...I love this album. Every song is awesome. I can't stop listening to it. I highly recommend this one if you're looking for some new alt rock.
B009AMALLM|2.0|Every time I watch a \\"Paranormal Activity\\" movie, I walk away from it wondering why I put myself through the experience. I loathe them more than anything in cinematic history. I vainly hope that the next one couldn't be any worse than the one before it. However, they continue to disappoint me with \\"Paranormal Activity 4.\\"<br /><br />A family takes in a little boy when his mother is hospitalized. Unexplainable things begin happening shortly after his arrival. Is it all coincidence or did the child bring something supernatural into the house with him?<br /><br />Writer Christopher Landon and directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman really have nothing new to add to what has come before in the \\"Paranormal Activity\\" franchise. Sure, we get some new ways to incorporate found footage into the movie like computer and iPhone cameras as well as Kinect sensors. The visuals and outcome are all the same, though. We get shadows, bumps, flickering lights, books falling, utensils floating, and a laundry list of other hoaxes and illusions too long to list.<br /><br />I'm not going to say there aren't some genuinely scary moments. They're few and far between. Viewing \\"Paranormal Activity 4\\" is the equivalent of watching paint dry for 90 minutes with a bubble rising and popping every 10 minutes.<br /><br />I have the formula for the films figured out as well. There's a low rumbling every time something \\"scary\\" is about to happen. Unfortunately, nothing every REALLY happens until the last 10 minutes. All we get before that are some loud bumps and a few elaborate but mostly elementary parlor tricks.<br /><br />Creator Oren Peli does deserve a standing ovation for tricking so many people (not me; I see them for free, thankfully) into wasting money on these films year after year. \\"Paranormal Activity 4\\" alone brought in $140,706,358 off of a budget of $5 million. The entire series so far has cost $13,015,000 to make and grossed $714,788,650. Now that's just smart business!<br /><br />Is there any way to really gauge the video or audio quality of \\"Paranormal Activity 4?\\" The movie is made up of video, computer camera, and night-vision footage of different qualities. We are given zero cinematography to praise or damn here. The 5.1 surround sound offers nothing to viewers except when there's a loud bang or low rumble from somewhere in the room. There's no musical score or real dialogue to speak of.<br /><br />The \\"Paranormal Activity 4: Unrated Edition\\" features nine minutes of extra footage not seen in theaters. I can't even begin to imagine what the additional scenes could be. There's no way I was sitting through both versions to find out.<br /><br />The only bonus material included on the Blu-ray version is a 28-minute featurette entitled \\"The Recovered Files.\\" It's basically deleted scenes in the form of additional \\"found footage.\\" Congratulations are in order to anyone who can sit through it.<br /><br />Something else that eludes me is why they rate these movies R. There's nothing here that isn't seen in a PG-13 horror film or watered-down teen sex romp. All they'd have to do to make even more money at the box office is cut out three or four expletives. They'd then have a teen-friendly horror movie tailor-made for kiddies to enjoy.<br /><br />I've said it before and I'll say it again. The \\"Paranormal Activity\\" films are made for people who don't regularly watch horror movies. Anyone who tells you any differently is lying. \\"Paranormal Activity 4\\" is another lackluster entry in a franchise which will continue to be a successful Halloween novelty until they stop making money. Therefore, I see no end in sight.there any way to really gauge the video or audio quality of \\"Paranormal Activity 4?\\" The movie is made up of video, computer camera, and night-vision footage of different qualities.

0143120255|5.0|There are practically no words in this book.  It graphically compares NY and Paris via clever graphics.  So don't be surprised if you get it.  It is very entertaining and well done.  The more familiar you are with NY and Paris the more one will appreciate it.  We enjoyed it very much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love love love this game. I don't know what I would do without it! If you don't give thi five stars your cra cra! So i hope you'll enjoy this game cause I know I do!!! :)
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is a book that kept me reading, chiefly because it was a book club pick but also because it WAS a page turner that kept me guessing.<br /><br />Then came the end...I hated it!  Had I been reading a paper version and not a Kindle version, I'd have tossed it into the trash.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This version of the classic Sherlock Holmes franchise takes place in modern times and has a great array of characters.  I have to give Mr. Moffat a nod for his great update of the stories to work in modern times.  Still hoping for a few more episodes down the line.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Bought this for my 8 year old's kindle fire.  She hasn't stopped playing it since I purchased it.  Love it!!!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is awesome little flash. Works great. If you use little creativity (or just go online and search) you can achieve great results.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|Nice app, but there needs to be better directions on how to use all the features. For example,a tip popped up that I could change the way the cover looked, but when I tapped it, no instruction came up to tell me how to do it. Most of what I found, was by random clicking.<br />Also a choice of fonts doesn't seem to come with this version.<br />But for just jotting down notes,it's okay for the price I paid for it.
B00001X590|5.0|I grew up on this record.....Joe helped me get there.....now that I'm replacing my old vinyl records, this is one of my favorites.....check it out.....SandPaperCadillac, TheChangeInLouise, all the rest.....awesome.....plus there's JimmyPage on guitar.....check it out.....
B0042TV4IW|4.0|This is a charming account of life in 19th century English rural society.  Fans of other British TV series will find several familiar faces along the way!
B0013O123Q|4.0|Way too brutal for America.....if you absolute like 'Saw' or 'Hostel' then perhaps.....the rape scene in this 'snuff' movie is way beyond compare.....you need a very 'tuff' skin for this 'butcher' fest.....enter at your own desire.....
B00821OX98|4.0|Well written series with interesting characters.  Always something new to keep one hooked on the next episode.  Mostly plausible  story line, with enough variety of character types.  Keeps me watch and wondering.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|THe animation is great, it's funny, lots of laughs for the kids, my daughter LOVES monsters so this is one of her favorites for sure.<br /><br />I gave the product 4 stars simply because i'm not crazy about the Amazon Digital service because i can't download the movie - i have to stream it every time i watch it.  Which means with kids you're streaming HD ALL the time with these movies.  I'll opt for blu-ray, or itunes next time simply for the downloadable factor.
B0037NVM1I|3.0|I tested out Amazon Prime streaming service and it was ok. The movie still had some jerkiness and I have a 10mbps download connection. But I am just picky and prefer the BD Skynet addition better. Most people would be happy with this streaming but I feel people (like me) in the niche dedicated Home theater segment, will not.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book is so right for the times we live in.  I love how Jodi's books give you a view from so many different angles.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Nice game. Seems easy to play. Different characters really make it challenging to play. So far no problems have come up.
1451629192|5.0|What can you say about Jaycee's story but wow?  I could not stop reading this book (in fact I was upset anytime I got interrupted while reading).  It took some time for me to adjust to her writing style, but It was written as she recalled memories and included her personal journal.  It cannot get any more personal than this.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|This Downton Abbey season 3 was advertised as the unedited UK Verson,  but some of the scenes aired on PBS have been deleted and others have been added.  Will AMAZON refund the purchase price of this video or provied a store credit in the amount of the purchase price??
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a simple, basic calculator.  It doesn't do much above 4 function, but I'm not going to use my Kindle if I need to do any advanced math anyway.  The only negative thing about this calculator is that it is slow to load.
B001S86J0I|5.0|If you are looking for a really funny movie with an outstanding cast & characters that are so over the top you can't help but laugh at then this is your movie. Absolutely one of the funniest & best movies I have seen. With parody infused touches & hints of (dare I say) Star Trek like characters that will keep you laughing from beginning to end. Absolutely 5 stars for this delightful comedy.
0062009540|5.0|Bought this for my niece and she was thrilled with it. Will be buying the rest of the group of book for her.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|A friend recommended it and it is a great CD to workout to, a mix of good artists. Great CD!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down! It is rare to find a book that is so captivating it feels like you are experiencing everything yourself.... the confusion, determination, panic and fears. The ending was thrilling and caught me completely by surprise! I would highly recommend this story!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Enjoyed watching this from beginning to the end. Love their connection in the movie. The ending is a shocker! Great Movie
B0011Z76RS|5.0|I love linkin park...it's the best music to run to.  Even though I had already downloaded several songs, i went ahead and got the album because it was $5.
B0018QXL1K|5.0|You cant go wrong with this old classic TLC CREEP CREEP CREEP! Best album they did in my mind! Always on replay!
B0092SPYQG|4.0|i have to have a good beat to run to and several of the songs on this album fit the bill.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I just love this series. Each season ender makes you wonder if they will leave you hanging on the cliff waiting to see just what will happen next season....Yup! they did it again and I cannot wait to see what happens to Bones next season! What a GREAT show!
B0083EW97W|5.0|Reminds me of some of Claptons work.  I like it but it's different than other albums.  Very bluesy and mellow.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I enjoyed this action packed novel. The only thing that I had a bit of a problem with is the assault of a plethora of characters and not being able to easily follow & remember who's who.  It didn't help that the names were odd, and some were very similar. Giving just one example there are the T'lan Imass, and the Tiste Andii (sp?).  This may not be an issue for some, but for me, I had to make myself keep reading in hopes that I'd catch on to the many ambiguous plots.  Overall I found myself looking forward to picking it back up every time I left off and I'm glad I stuck with it.  It's hard to find a great fantasy author.  One other thing.. I wish there was better character development for the protags.
B0040GR01M|4.0|Got a deal on this download album so it was worth getting the whole thing rather than just picking the songs i like.  I have to have a good beat to run to and about 1/2 these songs fit the bill.
B008PZYZH6|5.0|The musical score is great and the camraderie is stimulating.  Having a strong role for Penelope Cruz is great.  The long standing friendship between the two guys is portrayed with humor and believability.  The on-location sites are phenomenal and I'm glad they show a lot of the countryside.  This is one of those movies that you get to cheer on the good guys, the bad guys are believeable, and the usual twist is also included.  I also enjoy that there is little cursing in the movie.  I get so tired of hearing every other word of OMG, etc.  I want dialogue, not slang.  I watch this frequently to enjoy a good modern movie.
B008I34ZFW|3.0|If you like classic high budget B movies, you will like this. I found it kind of disappointing. They tried to hard to make it B movie like.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. If you didn't have it get it. It is worth the 7 dollers. You can do every thing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoy good acting and this is an excellent of example of actors making you forget that you are not 'spying' on their private lives thru the window of television.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I found it depressing as this man's life unraveled despite his heroic saving of the aircraft.  Denzel did a good job, but the content of the film was 'a bummer'.
0765325950|2.0|I have read all the other books in this series and this one just did not live up to the level of writing as the others did. It was as if this book was hurried through or they couldn't figure out the story line so they just threw in a lot of battle scenes. There were many questions unanswered, important issues given very little thought and just thrown in small spaces in between the heavy battle scenes. To me this book was a disappointment and left me feeling as if I had been cheated and then the ending did not seem to make any sense to me.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The ending was shocking . . . it really can shake you up.<br /><br />It is remarkable though, for you are put into the same quandary as the Japanese insurance agents.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I think this movie was made with the child as well as the adult in mind. I will be purchasing this movie as soon as I have money to spend on it! My kids and I LOVED it and watched it several times before the rental ran out....lol. This is a must see! Adam Sandler did a great job!!!
0307279189|5.0|I am recommending this book to everyone I meet. A truly inspirational book about our history with running and the potential for human achievement. I hardly ran before I read it, and I've just run second marathon. Read it!
B00992CF6W|1.0|This thing is so lame compared to the REAL mind craft... u don't even get hard core mode!!!! Do not buy this game!
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is a very touching and sad story I would recommend this to everyone.  I love the War Horse story.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|Good idea, but something got wrong. When they fit my newborn, she wasn't really paying attention to them. Plus, the bugs were too heavy and made the socks to slip away. After 2/3 months she became interested in her feet, but by that time they didn't fit anymore. The rattles would probably have been a better fit for us.
1895565375|5.0|My kids love this book, they grab it every night and want to read it before bed. They are even starting to say it with me. :)
0345479092|5.0|Very clear and easy to read. Totally loved it! I printed the &#34;crying-chart&#34; enclosed and kept it in bedroom, living room and nursery.<br />This is a MUST HAVE manual.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Although I think the first one was a bit better, Catching Fire has a good amount of suspense and character development. There are some twists and turns during the Games that I didn't see coming. It's the kind of book that makes you wonder what the characters are really thinking and what their intentions really are.<br /><br />This one goes into much more detail about how the Capitol operates and gives you more insight about Haymitch.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I first discovered this movie on HBO in November of 2012 and thought it was delightful.  Since then I have watched it three more times and decided I really needed to have it for my collection.  So many wonderful actors (adore Hugh Grant and Colin Firth), sweet scenarios, and terrific music.  Although it is a Christmas movie, it makes you feel so lovely inside each time you view it, that you don't even notice that it's not time to trim your tree, but just time to celebrate those joyful feelings.  Obviously, I had to own the cd, so I purchased two cd's and three movies (two to give to my best friends for gifts).  I bet they too will find themselves dancing with the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) in their kitchens (as I have each time I watch it!!).<br /><br />Got to love Amazon and its one stop shopping, especially with Prime.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw The Hunger Games in the theater and thought it was okay. Which lead me to read the book. The book is far better than the movie. There is just too much that the movie leaves out or changes.<br /><br />I normally don't read fiction but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I finished Catching Fire and I'm reading Mockingjay right now.
B00007BH5C|5.0|You can't go wrong with a soundtrack from Lord of the Rings.  A great piece to sleep by or play while gaming.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|love the game! the graphics are cute and the music is lovely. works really well no problems at all worth the dollar! :)
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|When Oasis split I, there was really no question about which brother was going to come up with the better solo album.  Noel has not lost his gift for writing seemless rock and roll nor writing witty and intelligent lyrics.  Great album, no question about whether this belongs in any audiophile's collection.
0345529057|1.0|This review has little to do with the books themselves but more to do with how the product was received. The package was delivered to me in a box that looked as if it had been through a traffic accident and simply left shoved in the mailbox. Needless to say there is considerable damage to the book; truly disappointed with amazon to the point of discontinuing use if the situation is not rectified in some way.
B0006L16N8|4.0|One of the few albums I own where I don't have to skip through.  Unlike some albums where only every other track is good, on X&Y every track is a gem.
0061743526|5.0|Very happy with this product.  Just as described.  Arrived in the time specified!  Pleased with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone else!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great read - so much suspense it's hard to stop reading. Another successful thriller by Gillian Flynn - must read.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Started palynig this game just after I got it and now I can't stop. Lot of fun but still learning all the extras that go with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Page-turner until the end. Best book of 2012 and one of my all-time favorites. Gillian Flynn has an amazing writing style that is unmatched.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I love the British soap opera :) The first half of season two was a little over the top (drama), but season three is great. Love the characters.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Couldn't ask for a better series with a struggle all throughout and without it being the classic hero struggle and all works out in the end.. in this everything has a price as in life it gives you something to hope for and struggle to remember wouldn't pass this for the life of me.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this game it is so fun. I do wish that you could save your cool designs. I do this cool arrangement and so I restart. but its fun and my little bro. loves it<br />.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Dad and boys loved it! Adam Sandler was funny as always. We'd recommend it to anyone. A great family movie
B00BECZPI0|5.0|about time its back on, i was going through dramatic emotional bouts waiting for episode 9 to start, i love it ive loved this show from day 1
B00ANW33CM|1.0|This game must be for younger people.  I'm 40+ and I just don't get it.  My advice is to save your money.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing!!! The turn this book took kept me amazed the entire time! A 100% must read!!! Everyone should read this!!!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel....What more is there to say? Denzel is always fabulous but this was not a great movie in general.  There are many parts of the movie that could have been left out and they would not have been missed.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I'm really enjoying it, I like the story behind it all.  I'm not giving it 5 stars because of the repetition but I'm still enjoying it.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|Room is the story of 5-year-old Jack and his mother who are both are held captive in an 11 x 11 room.  Jack was born in the room and has no knowledge of the outside world.  Midway through the book, Jack and his mother escape, wherein Jack experiences &#34;Outside&#34; with fear, confusion, and wonderment.  The author's attempt to capture the 5-year-old voice is noteworthy, but flawed.  Jack is precocious and very verbal, thanks to his mother's instruction and the television in their room.  Nevertheless, Jack is flummoxed by pronouns.  Having raised three children, this read as an affectation.<br />  I was also irritated by the incessant references to breast feeding.  I understood Donoghue's purpose in including these references (the first 10 times), but the endless repetition made the book read at times like a handbook for the La Leche League.  I was much less satisfied with the novel after Jack and his mother escaped.  At times, like Jack, I thought they were better off back in Room; Ma's family were very unlikeable except for the step-Grandpa who apparently spent a good bit of his time stoned.  Most disappointing was the degeneration of Ma who, while they occupied Room, tenderly cared for Jack and aggressively protected him, yet descended into self-absorption upon their escape.  I'm sure psychologists would argue that this is plausible, but it seemed too much of a personality change to me.  This woman had dedicated herself to Jack's well-being for five years.  Her near abandonment of him later did not make sense when in a very real sense, Jack wasn't yet rescued.<br />  In the second half of the book, Donoghue provides commentary on modern society through Jack's voice as he experiences Outside, but her observations, while thought provoking, were a bit clumsily executed.  All in all, I would say the book, while readable, is a rather superficial treatment of a dramatic captive story.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This like all is another great Harry Bosch novel and is good until the end.  Harry just gets better and better.  I loved it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Judy drench and Maggie smith can do no  wrong....and I loved the setting .i found the characters very human and appealing  and the plot totaling engaging
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was drawn in and unable to stop reading from the first chapter.  This book has awakened me in several ways.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|The sound quality is free of recording noise, allowing the tonal quality and character of both the pianist and orchestras to shine thru. Amazing really considering the dates of recording. Numerous CDs are &#34;Favorites&#34; of Van Cliburn, from various composers, so there is some duplication of tracks.<br /><br />Perhaps this set is so new that metadata has yet to be &#34; on file&#34; requiring manual data input on all but 2 of the 27 CDs was required.<br /><br />A bit like having books in my library with out titles, covers, or table of contents, but I have to assume RCA will follow thru and complete their work.<br /><br />This box set is well worth the investment.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Absolutely incredible read. Almost impossibly hard to put down. Excellence again courtesy of George R.R. Martin! Buy this book now if you enjoyed A Game of Thrones.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I would recommend this product to Celine Dion fans. This DVD package includes 2 DVDs: one with the full &#34;A new day&#34; Vegas performance and one with backstage cameras and cameras following Celine. You get to see some details of her life and how she spends the day of the concert.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever enjoyed!!!! I am a fan of British period pieces and this one stands on its own against its predecessor's!  Marvelously dramatic and charmingly funny!  This series will be one I watch over and over again.  Must own it and I am receiving it from my husband of 25 years as a Valentines day gift.  We enjoyed it on MPBN and look forward to watching again!!  Bravo to you all from Julian Fellowes  right down to the boom operator and those lovely Brits that allowed us into their home to become a part of television history!  Thank you all for making marvelous television!  Sincerely a devoted fan, Joyce from Maine,USA
B007N8RULO|5.0|THIS GAME CAN BE CHALLENGING AND FUN FOR HOURS. THIS GAME IS BETTER ON  HARD, EASY IS GOOD FOR ANYONE NEW TO THE G A ME.
B004XQO8VO|3.0|Husband enjoyed it.  Not my genre of movies but not<br />Bad.  He will have another keeper in his collection.  Thanks
0316010669|4.0|Like The Tippng Point, Blink presents an interesting perspective on the movers and shakers in today's society. The book is fun reading, but it is definitely more pop psychology than hard scientific fact. Malcolm Gladwell is a good writer and will keep your attention throughout the book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a great relatable book, it  was amazing! Its very down to earth something similar to your life. Such an inspiring book.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|If you enjoyed listening to &#34;Cruise&#34;, their somewhat newly released single, you will more than likely enjoy listening to the whole album. There are a couple slower songs, quite a few songs that can be used for dancing and a party. Not extremely up beat, but fast enough to enjoy a dance or two. Overall, a very good album. Definitely recommend!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple  Run is the funniest game I have EVER played. You get so addicted to it,and you get mentally attached to it,and you teach yourself different strategies,you learn to focus. I think EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD SHOULD PLAY THIS FUN,FUN,FUN HUGGING GAME!!
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Good mistery but the seek and find for evidence is annoying and bothersome makes me not want to play suggestion give skip option for them.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed the humour and the quirky language.One slow patch near the start about the philosophy of religions that could deter some readers before they got into the book but keep reading.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Although I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Kate Morton's novels, this is certainly my favorite.  I really couldn't put it down.  Her style of combining our current time with historical fiction is so interesting and the relationships developed between characters is fascinating as well.  The entire story keeps you guessing...and you find that you change you're opinion on how it will end with every turn.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I'm the person who rage-quits the first level of LEGO HARRY POTTER.  I used to play video games when they had only a joystick and maybe one button to worry about.  I am confounded by the playstation controller.<br /><br />This game is amazing.  It is not a shooter, is kind of a \\"quest\\", but mostly it is very Zen.  The graphics and music are incredible.  Get this game and play FLOWER if you want to feel like you're flying.  The soundtrack alone is worth the purchase price.<br /><br />I'm also someone who plays a game once and I'm done.  I don't like to replay levels.  This is the only game where I look forward to playing it through again and again, exploring as much as possible.
B002W7H3EA|1.0|As much as I love Alfred Hitchcock, I was very disappointed by this Amazon offering.  There was no audio at all, and I had no recourse once I purchased it.  It was maddening to watch the clock tick as my investment flew out the window.  Doubt that I'll rent from Amazon again with this kind of quality to look forward to.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The cast was great and I enjoyed the richness of the culture of India that was protrayed.  I enjoyed the story line and characters very much.  My husband thought it was only okay.  But all in all, a pleasant diversion.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; stories and this last one is just as thrilling as the first. All of these books are so real and believable that I have a fear of Washington DC and the people we send there.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This is very interesting and have lots of fun just with the 35 puzzle is my chalange my grandkids love it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It gave a very good account of how the old large estates functioned. All of the characters had different lives and dreams and their stories were interesting and told well
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Excellent movie, very good  special effects and surprising ending.keeps you on the edge of your seat. Very entertaining.<br />Thinking about taking the train.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|This is--very simply-- is joyful.  Josh just gets better. And better!  The music is instantly memorable while the lyrics speak to experience.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great story, great guy.  Jurek did not hold back and revealed his beautiful and sensitive qualities through his stories of incredible achievements.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|If you are a hard core T&S fan like myself this album has been a long time coming. So what about Heartthrob? Well, it certainly isnt Sainthood, which had moments of brillance but was inconsistant. And it most certainly isnt The Con, which is a masterpiece not just by T&S standards but by anyones. What it is for me is a very strong pop album that is intelligent and beautifully crafted. Plenty of catchy songs and perfect harmonies. Heartthrob is consistantly good with no throw away tracks. But here is where it gets dicy for me. I am not a huge pop fan. What drew me to T&S in the first place was the edgy, dark alt rock music of their earlier albums. I got hooked by songs like The First, My Number, I Hear Noises, Living Room and etc. I would imagine that new fans who are attracted by songs like Closer will be thrilled with Heartthrob. For older fans my guess is the new direction my take some time. The girls are not kids anymore and are leaving the early angst behind for a more mature sound. For anyone who wants a peak at the raw brilliance of a very young T&S check out the youtube video of The First (official music video) and tell me you dont see genius in the making.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Not only the graphics so beautiful, but the story line of the game is great. Over all, great adventure game. I wish it was longer!

B00APUQT7I|4.0|I caught bits and pieces of it, because I rented it for the kids. But what I did see made me laught. It  had a great underlying story with awesome graphics and detail.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a complex & thrilling story...I am anxious to read the last sequel.  I want to know who survived.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I watched this one with my kids and we were in suspense the whole time. the story was great and heart felt with much comedy and excitement, we had a great time watching this one.

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|The story was fantacy and action with a twisst at the end. IT had me on the edge of my seat more then a couple of times. I advise anyone that has time to sset down and watch it, to do so they will love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so fun. it is like temple run but even better.I love this game so much.love love this game.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I wish more games were like this one. Kept me interested. Not too hard, not too easy, it was just right.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of sparks best!!!!!! Definitely a must read! The story line is done beautifully. And you will be eager to read every page
1616550414|5.0|This book. So awesome. I just got it in the mail today, and I've been reading through it and studying every last bit of it. This book is so great, it's a Zelda Lover's Bible. =)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It is a great show. Enjoyed it a lot. Love the interaction of the actors and  the plots.<br />It was a great series.
030758836X|3.0|I started out really enjoying this book - one of the few books where I started out not liking EITHER of the main characters.  Then, as it progresses, you tend to lean towards one of them.  I had to keep myself from peeking ahead of the story to see what would happen.  As it started winding down, I realized that the author better have had a shock in store for us.  Instead, it was a disappointment!  Seriously?  I mean, I spent many nights really getting into the story and thinking how brillant it was, only to be let down.  The ending was just plain stupid, IMO.<br /><br />Also, as many of the other reviews have stated, the language is quite foul.  Could have done without it.  Not going to rush out and get any of her other books.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I only got this game because it was the free app of the day.  Normally I avoid these because of cheesy story lines.  This one was okay until the &quot;Zen master&quot; or whoever he is came out.  I didn't play these previous one, so that was weird to me.<br /><br />The hidden object scenes aren't bad, though I'm used to Big Fish and their Mystery Case Files games.  The objects are smaller, but that's to be expected from the smaller screen.<br /><br />And to those saying they HAVE to post to Facebook or Twitter, there is actually a small x in the top right corner of the box.  It's just a bit hard to see.<br /><br />All in all, an okay game, but I haven't gotten to where everyone else is glitching.  I still wouldn't pay three bucks for this game though.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I would like to issue you with a challenge. I challenge you to read this book and to not have the biggest grin on your face at the end of it. This is the type of book that when you get to the end you just want let out an audible sigh and smile to yourself. It truly is a feel good book.<br /><br />\\"Life is not a PG feel-good movie. Real life often ends badly. Literature tries to document this reality, while showing us it is still possible for us to endure nobly.\\"<br /><br />As there has been a movie released I should mention that I did in fact read the book before I saw the film. As this is a review of the book I will attempt to stay on point but just wanted to mention that the film was also very good. However it should be said that they are completely different. I was actually a bit shocked to see how much they had changed between the book and the film... as in how were they even allowed to keep the same title? But in the end both are good in the their own ways, I would say the book just slightly wins out in my opinion as is normally the case when it comes to the book vs. the film.<br /><br />\\"I don't want to stay in the bad place, where no one believes in silver linings or love or happy endings.\\"<br /><br />The story follows Pat who we first meet up with as he is being released from a mental institution (the bad place). He has suffered a mental break and his mother has come to get him released and take him back to his childhood home with her and his father. The events that occurred prior to him being institutionalized are slowly integrated into the story. Since Pat can also not remember you are learning the details at the same time as he is and this allows you to experience the emotions right along with him.<br /><br />\\"When I run, I always pretend I am running toward Nikki, and it makes me feel like I am decreasing the amount of time I have to wait until I see her again.\\"<br /><br />Pat has one goal in life now. To reconnect with his wife Nikki. He starts to read the classic books she has always enjoyed, he loses weight and is obsessed with exercising to keep himself fit. He is working hard on being kind, not right. All is going well in his mind until a friend invites him to dinner... this is where he meets Tiffany.<br /><br />\\"She looks sad. She looks angry. She looks different from everyone else I know--she cannot put on that happy face others wear when they know they are being watched. She doesn't put on a face for me, which makes me trust her somehow.\\"<br /><br />I adored Tiffany. She has had her own struggles and is still fighting to get beyond her past and the devastation in her life. She is so very closed off. There are many scenes that she is a part of where she does not speak a single word to Pat however there is so much taken away from their interactions. Everybody is cautious around Pat, afraid of what to say as it may trigger an episode or free up a memory he has suppressed. He can be himself around her. He talks and talks and she simply listens.<br /><br />This is not to say she is always quiet. Not a chance. When she has something to say she does not hold back and I just loved that about her. She is a woman of few words but the words she does say mean something.<br /><br />\\"Looking into another person's eyes for an extended period of time proved to be a powerful thing. And if you don't believe me, try it yourself.\\"<br /><br />Their relationship was really a joy to see unfold. Nobody could have pushed these two together. They needed to learn to overcome their pasts as a way to move forward together. It really is lovely.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that you read this book. It will help remind you that everybody has hard times in life but the silver linings are there... you just need to remember to look out for them.<br /><br />\\"Most people lose the ability to see silver linings even though they are always there above us almost every day.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsthe classic books she has always enjoyed, he loses weight and is obsessed with exercising to keep himself fit.

B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book was funny. I really liked it.<br />It was a little different from the movie but . It was really good.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|this heat sink is awesome. with the stock heatsink i had it was horable and the temp was like 70 Degrees Celsius but when i got this heatsink i got 30 degrees celsius while i was overclocking and gaming as well. so overall its a great heatsink for the money. i definatly recommend this for anyone that dosent have a big budget for a new computer or just upgrading the one they have already
B000QRIGLC|3.0|The book was well written. I did find the chapters on the seals training seemed to repeat its self too much. I did enjoy it though.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Works great. My only problem is that I haven't found anything out there to really push it. I put all my games like WoW and the Old Republic to their highest settings. It's been a year and I'm still happy with it. I can't seem to overclock it enough. Been over a year and it's still running strong.
B005PK56TA|5.0|One of the best series on TV. Not even a horror fan but this is very good writing and acting. I hope there is a season 3.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game....pisses me off....lol. I'll get the high score eventually. Kids love it too and the wife who never plays games....lol
B004XUMMFE|5.0|My wife and son watched the whole series in a couple of nights. Must have been pretty captivating. They were hooked!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|used to play on my 7\\"fire... still getting used to fire HD. moves don't always take. but game itself is really addictive. love it
B0000T6JGU|5.0|First, the Beatles recorded a series of rehearsals, studio sessions, and live tracks in hopes of piecing together a new album in the spirit of their first, free of overdubs or studio trickery. The album lay incomplete for about a year, with no one able to approve a mix or running order. (Many versions of this album were issued on bootleg, including copies of acetates not approved by the band.) The working title for this album was \\"Get Back.\\"<br /><br />Second, producer Phil Spector was brought in to make sense of the disarray. He chose and mixed a number of tracks, in a couple cases adding strings and choir and even wiping band backups off the multitracks in favor of his lush versions. This was issued as the album \\"Let It Be\\" to accompany the documentary film of the sessions with the same name.<br /><br />Third (decades later), Paul McCartney sought to right this injustice with a cleaned-up, toughened-up mix of the straight band takes sans overdubs (but with editing). This was issued as \\"Let It Be... Naked,\\" with a bonus CD (or 7\\" EP, if you bought the vinyl) of studio chatter and additional unreleased songs.<br /><br />All that said... I was expecting a rather academic polish on the Spector album. What I didn't expect was a fully fledged rock album in the George Martin style, with the jokes, flubs, and ad-libs of the Spector mix (and all earlier attempts) removed. If you've ever heard the original single of \\"Get Back,\\" this album finally delivers on the tight, smart, strong style of that very cool record.<br /><br />A particular surprise was the version of \\"Across the Universe.\\" This was never performed satisfactorily during the Get Back sessions, so Spector went back to the original take from a year earlier, overdubbed at the time with sitar and amateur female backups and with Lennon's vocal flanged to sound \\"trippy.\\" Spector added strings and choir, but this version strips it down to just Lennon's untreated vocal and his guitar in a tear-inducing, intimate mix I've never heard before.<br /><br />This is an expensive record, but it really does feel like getting a \\"new\\" Beatles album, with the \\"wrong\\" of Let It Be righted at last. Not academic at all, it rocks pretty dang hard.<br /><br />(And the vinyl sounds fantastic.)
B00846F1YW|5.0|The graphics are so crisp and show up really well on my Kindle Fire. I get bored with the dialog between searches but the game allows you to skip past it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is exellence the way that the game is structured is brilliant. I would recommend this game to anyone i have even got my family to play it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and exciting game that keeps you playing even after you die you still want to keep playing! Family fun and excitement!
B00006FDCD|4.0|i have not read the novel and didnt know anything about the movie so found it cheap and thought to watch. the first part was very good and creepy! the middle was still pretty good but the ending...well. i know the effects back in that time might not have been the best but i dont want to spoil it for anyone but lets just say it would have been a amazing' movie if the ending was just stronger. you will see once you watch it but it def is a movie you should see if you like creepy horror like the good ol days :)
B004UID2LC|5.0|...gets a lil funky every now and then but lets me download music for FREE99...cant beat that for a free app
0439023521|4.0|I'm a mom and the whole children killing children wasn't something I normally would want to read.  So my book club decided to read it so I thought I would give it a try.  I was surprised how it pulled me in and wouldn't let go.  It was so good I couldn't wait to read the next.
0765325950|4.0|The series finally ends. I actually thought it was about four books too long. Jordan really should have finished it in ten volumes. I don't know why he tried to keep it going past its prime. But now it's finally over. Volume 14 was too long by about 300 pages, but it's a tale I'm invested in, so even at that, I still enjoyed it.
B006NYDV7Q|4.0|I like the packaging and the moderate price tag very much with this set, and also with the matching set of Weather Report's earlier records.<br /><br />The music doesn't knock me out though.  To me Jaco Pastorious' playing didn't fit in well with what the band had done best (groove music with a jazz twist).  The music on these records becomes more precious, and less vital than earlier records.  Give me the title track to \\"Black Market\\"; give me a few tracks on \\"Mr. Gone\\".  The rest of this just isn't knocking me out.  I think that Weather Report became less than they should have been right about the point at which this set starts.  That is probably not all about Jaco and his shortcomings, but probably some of it is.  They became a high-minded concept and brand name that wasn't actually putting much great music out.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I love this book!!!  I know its probably written for teens but it was SOOOOOO good!!! Young innocent love with all the teenage misunderstandings! A must read for any age!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An updated and more intriguing look at class structure with love, conflict, disappointment, joy, and sadness.  Who could ask for anything more?

B008B1VYP0|1.0|The explicit songs are too much.  I don't mind a cuss word here and there, but can't tolerate these. Going to have to delete, so that my 5-yr old doesn't learn any new words.
0345529057|5.0|These are great books and it's always nice to buy books new.Can't wait to finish these and get to the rest of the series.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I figured with a walkthrough available I may as well give it a shot.  I'm so glad I finally did!  Yes, it was difficult, but if you keep checking your inventory and really think about how you can use it- if you like this type of game you know what I mean. And, yes, I used the walkthrough.  AND I LOVED IT !!!  EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!! I did so much better than I thought I would after reading the reviews.  I'm really tired of people leaving horrible reviews for games they don't understand.  It's not the game's fault if a person won't read the product description or the reviews.  The reviews, both good and bad, can give you a lot of specifics that can help you decide if it's the right game  for you.<br />  'The Haunt'  IS A GREAT GAME! Played perfectly on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.  I write this as 'The Haunt 2' is downloading.  Can't wait to get into it....
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome and I think that this is really cool and very fun because the breeding is fairly accurate
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a game that i like because it is a good challenge and the run is never the same
B0094K1K42|4.0|I am always impressed with Charlize Theron's ability to play the role of a not-so-beautiful character (and I don't just mean outwardly attractive).  Of course, there's hope for her in the story, but what you see her go through... it can make you uncomfortable.  You see the train wreck coming and you want to stop it.  Surprisingly realistic.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Don't waste your time on this Bruce Willis loser. We made it through the first 30 minutes bored to tears and then turned it off...waste of time and money.

B004UID2LC|1.0|I downlaoded it because I thought it would be nice but it almost gave me a virus. Ps don't say I didn't. warn u. :(
B00170I7GG|5.0|This movie has been part of my life for as long as I can remember.  When I lived with my parents I think we watched it every year on Groundhog Day.  It is still just as good as I remembered.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|I have watched this on several times and still love it.  I will be watching it again I am sure
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It starts out a bit technical but that just adds to the realism. One of the best books I've read in a long time. It kept me on the edge the entire time.
B004G600A4|5.0|I am a BIG fan of all things Walt Disney. I love the characters he creates, and the stories that come with them. All of the Disney movies are always a favorite in my house. &#34;Tangled&#34; is one of the best princess movies ever. EVER. Love everything about this movie!<br /><br />I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse.&#34; -Walt Disney
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This was the best cop show I have ever seen. Was so glad to know that when I was told the order the complete series, this is one show that once you watch one episode, there is not turning it off! Wish there was more series!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I am a BIG fan of all things Walt Disney. I love the characters he creates, and the stories that come with them. All of the Disney movies are always a favorite in my house. &#34;Up&#34; is such a cute movie, you may want some tissues near by just in case. Storyline is great, the animation is superb, and you just fall in love with each and every character.<br /><br />&#34;I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse.&#34; -Walt Disney
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent writer. A real page turner. Kept the story interesting all the way until the end. Would recommend this book.

All of the Disney movies are always a favorite in my house. &#34;Ratatouille&#34; is such a cute movie. It makes me want to become a chef! You will love this movie, if you're alright with seeing rats in a kitchen. If you can get past that, this movie is a winner!<br /><br />&#34;I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse.&#34; -Walt Disney
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I didn't have time to read a lot of detailed how toos and just wanted to play with my toddler
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Despicable Me allows children to see the good that underlies all people, to celebrate that bad guys can really be good guys if they find love and acceptance.  My kids love this movie, and I love the moral high road it sticks to as it weaves a fun and fanciful fairytale.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Same review as the first one. Worth the read. Very interesting character this christian grey. He is the reason you keep reading. You can relate very much with Ana's views about him. Now this book has even more pointless sex scenes. I barely ever read them because they are not<br />always important to the plot.<br />However, every now and then you<br />want to read bc they are too good to<br />pass up. Again I suggest reading this book. I am also reading the third one.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Everyone in our family loves this movie but non more surprisingly than my 1 year old daughter. She will happily sit and watch this movie from start to finish.  The three orphan girls in this movie are so adorable and entertaining as are the yellow minions.  It's is a must have movie for kids is all ages.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I liked this book because of its different approach to romance. It is definantly worth reading. I felt as confused as Ana about this christian grey character. His character made me want to continue to read the book and the next three out of curiousity. I love intimate scenes in books. However, towards the end I found myself skipping through the sex stuffto get back to the story line. Definantly read and decide for yourself.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story held my interest and if it wasn't for the disappointing ending,  I'd have given this book a higher rating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was fantastic. Just when I thought it was going to predictable... it started twisting in all sorts of dircetions! And then twists some more. It really kept me on my toes and could not put it down.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Downloaded this for my daughter. She enjoys it and it is does a good job simulating all the daily tasks involved with horse ownership. Would recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I bought  this book simply because Nicholas Sparks wrote it and I knew it would be good. In fact, it was better than good. It is empowering, emotional, exciting, thrilling... what more do you need? I was a bit concerned that it was going to be a tear-jerker as most of his books are, but it wasn't. It was just simply empowering.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is like taking the stores of the world with you wherever you go !  Ebay has opened purchasing to a broad spectrum ov worldwide variety of stores, shops and auctioners and now you can take it with you.  This also allows you to follow up on bids you have without having to be near your home PC.  Very handy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is so addicting! I love to use it for recipes that i can look up later when I'm out of ideas! I have also found great shopping websites through pinterest. :)
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I found this APP boring and of little value.  There are many other weather Apps to choose from that offer more especially on a local level.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Ive read every single John Grisham book. this again is another good one. It is a very easy read and does not require any law knowledge. i read it in about 3 days. My wife, who does not read any of his books picked it up and read this one and truly enjoyed it. she is now hooked on him and reading more.<br /><br />the story keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Quick access to the weather outside my door is what I was expecting in this App and I did get that and more.  Easy to find information on what to expect for the weather in my pinpointed area.  Video coverage is well presented in a quick &#34;down and dirty&#34; fashion which fits into my busy lifestyle.  Quick Easy Cheap.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|You just have to unlock the games and there is a bunch of them. Keeps the kids occupied for hours lol.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I have the last two movies on Blu Ray, so this just completed the collection.  Christopher Nolan did a great job with these movies.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is user friendly as to easy modification of how the game looks and works. It is true to the original game.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really like this series. It is well written, the characters are well developed and have depth. There is always a twist in the story line to surprise you. I often am able to figure out where the story is heading and how it will end. However that is not true of fringe. I love the character of Walter Bishop, his oddities make the show for me. I think John Noble is an excellent actor, he really gives Walter depth and makes the character of Walter real. I highly recommend this series. It's like a good book you can't put down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|\\"here we go again\\" I though \\"another romance Nicholas sparks book\\" but its SOO GOOD!!! It was a little slow in the begining but It got so hard to put down as I was getting towards the end!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|There are a lot of cutesy apps out there but the is one I use on a daily basis to accurately let me know exactly how much time I have left before the need to recharge. Good work!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I really like that you can make the puzzle as easy or as difficult as you want! The pictures are of high quality!<br />I was doing puzzles for days and having a relaxing time... love the music!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a love story? Who doesn't love a strong, rich and good looking man? Recommended it to all my friends.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Not one of the best we've seen of Denzel movies but definitely worth watching and a very good ending to the movie.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is very fun scary and if the Creator or someone is reading and quaint chapter 2 like this...DO IT!!!
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|I was enjoying the game until I couldn't continue without leaving a rating. I was able to get help then it wouldn't let me see the help until I rated it and then left a 20 word review.
B0095P31L6|2.0|The language seemed like it was too difficult for my 6 year old but he understood the basic premise of the story. I only wanted to watch it because I am a big Johnny Deep fan. I don't think it will become a part of our regular rotation.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|We all wonder what happens when a loved one passes on.  Dr. Alexander and his experience helps to answer this question. There is a process to reach everlasting life with our heavenly Father.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great product. Great sound quality and access to many good stations.  Initially downloaded to listen to one station (Martini in the Morning) but now use it for many others.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love it. I just want to have it without ads, but its VERY good. I loved it. My use is not quite frequent, but its very useful.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Nothing fancy here, just a no frills package, but no complaints as I did not need any extras.  Would recommend this to a friend.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It's light, sweet, smart and hilarious. A good reprieve from the more serious movies around these days. the voice acting is wonderful.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always Vince Flynn comes through with another thriller. The world needs a few people like Mitch Rapp to take care of business.
0062082353|4.0|Great auto - I was half way through it when the news said he had been murdered - tradgic.<br />Good read for anyone wanting to understand the mind of this hero.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I have used several different kinds of garlic presses over the years. I have been using this press for about 7 years now. I think the Rosle is the best one I've ever used. We use a lot of garlic in our house, in fact this press gets used almost every day. It is by far the easiest to clean, and I really like that it is stainless steel so there isn't any coating that will eventually flake off. If you use a lot of garlic I would recomend this one in a heart beat.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|it was great! fast and easy to download and purchased<br />The process of seeing movies on line is great<br />thanks
B0076DELIG|4.0|Enjoyed the book and would recommend i. I always like the recurring characters and his plots are well written.<br />Thanks Michael Connelly for pure enjoyment
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Very well written. Believable characters that take one on their journey with them, with all the highs, lows and in betweens.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|So Happy to find this for a great price. Love this series! Happy I found it on Blu-Ray as well!
B000077VR3|5.0|Moulin Rouge tells the story of a stunning courtesan and a penniless writer who fall in love. Their story is so beautiful and their love so pure that you can't help but fall in love as well. The music is fantastic - many complain that it's not &#34;original&#34;, but what does that matter? Everyone has a great voice and each song fits the story perfectly - the epitome of a musical. Definitely one of the cutest, sweetest movies you will ever see, and one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />Also, Amazon's service was amazingly fast - the DVD came within 18 hours of my ordering it (with two day shipping).
B0069UP2PI|3.0|It's like those \\"Valentine's Day\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\" movies...only a lot less happy.<br /><br />I don't think director Steven Soderbergh ever met a large cast that he didn't like.  This movie reads like a \\"who's who\\" of the actor's world.  It has Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, that woman from \\"Titanic\\", Laurence Fishburne, Bryan Cranston (dude's in everything these days), Ross and Monica's father from friends, Sanaa Lathan, Jude Law...and more!<br /><br />But you can have a cast of very good actors and that still doesn't mean the movie is going to work.  So does \\"Contagion\\" work?  Yes, it does.  As a slow boil drama.  But it deals with a weighty subject, a the issue of a worldwide catastrophy as a highly communicable fast killing virus breaks out.  The filmgoer should feel the weight of such an horrific event but this largely escapes us as Soderbergh goes about this project in an almost workmanlike procedural fashion.  Where is the hysteria and the sheer horror and sense of displacement that would occur as the virus spreads and becomes known?  \\"Outbreak\\", which was shot more as an action thriller, managed to give us at least a sense of this.  \\"Contagion\\" does not as it follows our characters, a few who are early afflicted with the disease and a lot of scientists who are out trying to trace its roots (***spoiler alert*** wash your hands and avoid the swine) and come up with a cure, to the barely triumphant conclusion.  And it seems to be trying to tell us something about ourselves, or share some moral.<br /><br />I freely admit, though, that whatever the moral of the movie is I missed it.  It may be that mankind survives or dies at the whims of a disinterested bioligical world.  Or it could be that our salvation lies within our very biological beings and that SCIENCE (our modern god) is what is capable of saving us so long as we continue to worship and obey (study and act upon its laws) at its feet.  This has all been done before, quite frequently, especially in science fiction (both good and bad, mind you).  Here the movie feels like a hollow event, like there is or should be something more, but all we're left with is what is on the screen...and whatever cold chill might run up and down our spine the next time we see someone leave a restroom without washing their hands or have a flying commuter sneeze or cough near us.especially in science fiction (both good and bad, mind you).

B006LSZECO|5.0|Once I started this book I could not put it down.  It started a bit weird, but continued to take turns for the better.  There were many twists and turns and I was quite shocked how it ended.  Well worth the money.
B002XUBDZ6|3.0|I've seen this movie many times.  It's not one of my favorite Arnie fliks but it is a fine flashback to the \\"me\\" decade.<br /><br />Based solely on the title alone Arnold should not have been considered for this movie.  But as it is based on a sadistic Corporate run television show (a pre-cursor to the reality fest of shows we see today) that off's its characters the big bad Arnold was utilized well for his muscular physicality and pure Austrian-accent-infused bravura.  He plays Ben Richards, a Corporate military enforcer who is unwilling to slay innocents and is so set up to be made to look like he did just that, who ends up on the reality \\"game show\\" \\"The Running Man\\" (hosted by well known Richard Dawson, host of the long-running game show \\"Family Feud\\") running for his life alongside his compatriots and trying to survive the likes of the WWE, beefed-up and neon-lit bogeymen who are essentially payed assassins.  They get what's comin' to 'em courtesy of Arnold's steel jaw and swarthy quips.  Along for the ride is the lovely Maria Conchita Alonso (whom I always got confused with Sonia Braga but that's another story).<br /><br />In the end the 1980's were made a little more iconic (or less, depending on your POV) with the addition of this violent Arnold vehicle.  For fans it's indispensible.  For neophytes it's somewhere around the middle of the line as far as his highs and lows go so start elsewhere.  For action buffs it's dated, but in a way that might make you feel good about yourself.  3.5 stars.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|It had been a long while since I had heard anything from The Wallflowers, which was what made me purchase this record. I didn't really know what to expect, but I guess that was what made it a mystery.<br /><br />This whole album has a feeling of a dream, like you're asleep and this is a journey you're having. Songs to really pay attention to are \\"Hospital For Sinners\\", \\"Misfits and Lovers\\", It's a Dream\\", \\"Love Is a Country\\", \\"Have Mercy On Him Now\\", \\"Constellation Blues\\", and \\"One Set Of Wings\\". I will mention that \\"Reboot The Mission\\" seems cool and all good at first, but now I skip it. I guess it took a month or two to realize how much of a real song it isn't. There's so many more poetic and in depth songs than that one on here. This really isn't an album you can rock out too, it's really more of a sit down and just listen kind of deal. If you're a writer, poet, etc., you'll love listening to this while you write. It has a very dreamy and inspiring sound, and well written lyrics. My favorite track is a tie between \\"Constellation Blues\\" and \\"One Set Of Wings\\".<br /><br />This is no \\"Rebel, Sweetheart\\". This is \\"Glad All Over\\". And believe me, you can tell the difference. And while this album is good, I still think Rebel, Sweetheart is the best Wallflowers album. The sound was right, the producer was right. But then they disappeared. But now they're back, and it feels like they're taking us into a dream! Good to have The Wallflowers back!
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Very high creep factor on this one.  Makes it difficult to sleep if you watch it just before bed.  Highly recommended!
B003CBVU30|3.0|Superstar was just okay.  I would not need to see it again.  It was not horrible, it was just not for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a great read and recommend it highly.  The book had added twist that I just didn't expect.  Great story!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My six year old fell in love with it.  She spent several hours on it the  first day and has revisted often.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick present U.S. history in an unflattering, unbiased style that allows the reader to draw their own conclusion regarding the machinations we are witnessing to today juxtaposed against that history.  The more we THINK things change, we learn that they actually are the same
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the most well written and creatively carried out stories I have read in a very long time.<br />Very thoughtfully done and the beauty in the language makes the story even more powerful....
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Liked this much more than expected. It was a bit confusing until we realized that the story line is happening synonymously with the other Bourne movies, not after as we had thought.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive game, I'm coming back everyday to play so I can complete the daily challenge and get those power-ups, very addictive game and the graphics are outstanding, would highly recommend.
B000FC130E|4.0|Good read.  fluid story telling.  the concept of two worlds existing in one, lent itself to a delightful and intriguing read.
B005USZML4|5.0|First of all this  book was a really good one because, it was constant adventure! adventure! adventure! I had to stop myself from reading the book 'til mid - night. I can't wait to read the rest of the series and hope John Grisham makes more of the series. I really want Theo and April to fall in love to. They are meant for each other, even I wish he liked me as a really really really really good friend. And maybe he will feel the same way he feels about April the same feelings for me, so back off April! ;-)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved the suspenseful scenes and the romance!!! Would I read it again anytime? Undoubtedly, yes I totally completely would!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|There are not many games out there for mobile devices that are as well made and planned out as the world of goo. It has complicated story and plotline that are great. Is quality and i would give 7/5 stars if it weren't for the price (but hahahahahhha i got it for free app of the day). Overallgreat and favorite app of mine.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Characters are well developed and the storyline is pulls the reader into the setting.  One feels the impact of the events as they unfold.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This is easily his best cd in years. It's amazing how creative people think drugs and alcohol fuel their creativity, yet when they get sober, they produce amazing stuff. If you like funky, blues based music, you can't go wrong with this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game I love it and play the game 24/7. I have to play the game all the Time. When I play it and die I get so FREAKING mad. Love this game.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|I had always heard what a master guitarist Richard Thompson is, and now I know why. Amazing guitarwork. His other albums only show flashes of his guitar talent, this one showcases it. As always, he is also a master lyricist and singer: I could easily see him singing &#34; The Music of the Night&#34;, from Phantom of the opera. Get this disc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever<br />I I I I I I I l l l l l l o o o o o o o vvvvvvvvvvvvvv eeeeeeee this game
B004HD61KE|5.0|ENJOYED Very much.  Well written and full of suspense. Never knew where it was going to take me next<br /> Highly recommend it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this show!! i just wish our satellite provider carried the channel that this show is on. Great show.
B0014JIFWG|5.0|Great shoes.I have worn nothing but crocs (to my wife's dismay) since 2003 - except for weddings and funerals! I briskly walk an hour a day for exercise and Crocs are great when walking on har cerfaces. I use the closed version for winter, they holdall the body heat in and the open version around the house and everywhere the rest of the year. I am 68 so fasion is not a concern although some of the new design are pretty nice - most comfortable shoes I have ever owned!
B00B19DMUE|3.0|This movie is ok if you just want some entertainment but not really that deep as far as the plot goes. Pretty much like most other low budget shows if your bored and not really sure what your in the mood for this might work
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is totally worth the download. It is so much fun that I can''t stop playing it. I totally recommend this game!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The cable arrived as scheduled and has performed very well to date. I am very pleased to report to you
B00AREIAI8|4.0|sometimes it wont open. sometimes it will. when it does its fun. it costs money a little bit but only to buy gems. otherwise its free and easy.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Pretty addictive game. I've played this on the Xbox and became pleased to see I can enjoy it on my Kindle as well. The app works very well every time.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|As a Comedy, it is hilarious; as a Romance, it is done tastefully; and as a Travelogue, the cinematography is splendid.  This is not meant to be a serious film, but one gets a glimpse of the genius behind it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This has been a very helpful app. I've done many things on my Kindle Fire HD with this app. It's very clear.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|While good, not one of his best.  Too many John Corey quips.  Dragged on a bit too much for me.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. The plot was good and developed interestingly. The characters were believable. Best of all was an ending you didn't see coming.
B001GF7WRW|5.0|Just receive them today, right out of the box I connected them to my FIIO E6 into my iPod and the sound coming out of them was better than I expected. Extremely comfortable, I hardly notice the weight, the cable is sturdy and solid. I already recommended them to my coworker who was looking at the same combination that I have.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This book started strong but I was disappointed with the ending.  The time travel concept always intrigues me but in this case didn't meet my expectations
B0084B5TK8|5.0|There's a reason why they call them classics! Just hang on through the first few pages until Jonathan Harker makes it to the Count' s castle, and you won't be able to put it down.
B00797MB0O|2.0|I thought it was going to be a dry humor kind of funny but even then i was disappointed. The nly reason i kept watching was because Patton Oswalt was a great character addition.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I loved this movie. I thought it was really cool how they altered the story of Abraham Lincoln to fit into the movie.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I think the book is very well witten, love the storyline and the concepts introduce, only got better with the development o characters, lagged at some points but still a great read.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|This movie was really good. I am never disappointed with Tim Burton movies. I would recommend this to anyone that likes Tim Burton's movies.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|If you have seen one episode- you are probably hooked, I have already purchased season 2 as I am typing this review!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|One of the best cds I've ever owned.  Every song is amazing and the band is so talented.  The definitely deserved the Grammy they got for The Best Record of the Year!!
B009G78EE2|4.0|Plenty of good tracks. The Heist is the best album I've purchased all year. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are both really talented.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|A few humorous moments strung together with a short, boring ending. Not a typically good Denzel Washington movie. Save your money.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|All I can say is... Love love love love love this song!! What a great beat and amazing lyrics too!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The preview of this movie does not even begin to show how funny this movie was. Mom and Dad loved this as much as the kids did. I would watch this again.
B0058YPL66|4.0|I had heard so much about this series, so decided to order it. I live in Rwanda, East Africa, and am always looking for a good show to hold my attention, and just get lost in from time to time. This show has been excellent. Even the girls who live with me who are Rwandese love it, despite the language barrior. It has enough action to even hold your attention when it is not your language. I look forward to getting the second season! (When it is available, and the 1-2 month wait for it to actually arrive here! Totally worth it though!)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Classic Stephen King!!!!A hard book to stop reading.I would say before starting this book be prepared to have a few hours free.Or days.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't get television reception and use Netflix and Amazon via Roku instead of cable TV. So I was delighted to be able to watch season 3! I love this series, at the surface it's soap opera - but the depth and quality of writing, acting, production make a complex, human story. MORE!
0399215921|4.0|My wife bought this one without realizing the actual size of the book. We love reading to our little guy so we wanted to stock up on books and well, this one is great for travel, but not one I read to him at night on a regular basis. Throw it in the car, your diaper bag, etc, it does fit nicely, but before you buy pay attention to the size of the book... still a good book for kids.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|&#34;SkyFall&#34;  Good action, amusing quips and of course Daniel Craig!  The first Bond film I have liked in many years.
B009NCM248|5.0|Simply put if you like Stone Sour you will love this album. Hell, even if you don't like them you might still love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! A good romantic book and a fairytale ending :) had a very good twist a little over half way through the book mad nervous, I thought it was going to end bad, then came the fairytale ending.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|my grandson loves playing this on my kindle. It entertains him. Thanks for making something that all ages can enjoy
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great absolutely beautiful I love the connection between them. Llllooooovvvveeeedddddd iiiiittttt! Amazing cool funny romantic and awesome yeah yeah yeah.
B003G4W49C|5.0|...this book, with \\"Speaker For the Dead\\", and the rest of the Ender series, make up some of the best fictional treatments of the coupled philosophies of peace and war. I recently discovered that a movie  version of  \\"Ender's Game\\" will come out in November (2013). Do yourself a huge favor, read the book first, then watch the movie. From the very little I've been able to find out about the film, (and sad past experience), my fear is that the full meaning and fantastic ethical complexity of this first book, (never mind the rest of the series), will be gutted and lost, maybe to make an ingenius space opera, maybe just an also-ran in this year's film offerings.<br /><br />Not just a science fiction classic, but a true classic regardless of genre, Card's writing is lucid, clean and beautiful. It makes plain and accessible the difficulties of highly intelligent and chronically underestimated children, the loneliness and longing of children who are too bright to fit into their own age groups, and too \\"immature\\"  to belong with the adults. Never known children to think and speak as they do here? Maybe you're just not listening...
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Its explains evry thing clearly  its words are ez to read so<br /><br />I reccomend it for all ages have fun
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I enjoy playing it when I have some time ... about 20 mins to play.  I'm working on getting into the virus stage.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this heart touching novel I so wish I was beautiful ,strong , amazing, never give up Katniss !!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was simply bored.  The turn of events too predictable. The salacious/snarky insights of Amazing Amy were amusing for a while, but even these became tedious quickly. The male protagonist, whose name I've happily forgotten, is pure white bread.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I decided to give this show a try and was captured right away with the storyline, plot and actors.  The show gives a good energy the whole way through, never boring.  I give this show the 5 stars because I truly enjoyed watching this show and can't wait for the new season to start.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My daughters and I are just addicted to pinterest. It allows us to create simple boards for all the things we love, also just things we would like to remind ourselves of later. The kindle version is super simple to set up and makes the app even more addictive. Just make sure you read terms of use with pinterest before using it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I had fun playing this game along with my children. Would recommend it for other people with children. Thanks for the fun experience.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is a good alternative for youtube app. U can download videos and mp3s in one place. Im happy with it.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Nice movie, beautiful English countryside. Beatrix Potter was not a shy mouse when it came to her independence and art.
B0095T3ES2|3.0|Thought it was cool to watch a movie that was filmed at least partly in Ann Arbor which is just a little ways from me.  The movie overall was pretty entertaining but it hit a snag about 2/3 of the way in and just dragged on until the end picked up.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|The Bourne Legacy had only a little of the good qualities from the previous 3, including suspense, action, and romance.
145210655X|3.0|I am a big Star Wars fan and so is a coworker who has a young boy so when this went on sale I bought a copy.  While I did find the book entertaining, it wasn't as cute or funny as some of the reviews stated.  There were a few really good ones but most of it seemed like a stretch to incorporate some quotes from the movies.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|It was an ok version that seemed closer to the actual novel but was not my favorite.  It seemed choppy.
B003JVH7XU|5.0|Starting off, the movie had tons of fighting and action. Im giving it 5 stars all the way. You might not understand it, if you havent seen undisputed II. Give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so fun even wen its switches places by itself the people are cool and i love the boogie boards i have like 98 boards great game
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus. Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said in these other reviews. Spiritual, atmospheric, engaging, elevating, heavy, intense, personal are all words that come to mind.<br /><br />The overall structure of the music is incredible. So many layers and textures completing an amazing work of art. Heavy and bone-crushing enough for metal fans and quiet/chill moments for music lovers that like to fully immerse themselves in a pool of sonic bliss.<br /><br />I pity people who don't get or enjoy this album. It's a wonderful work of art and will always be at the top of my list for best album ever.
0545265355|5.0|Have to say this was one of the BEST trilogies I've ever read! I felt like I was right there beside Katniss, Peeta, & Gale. Everything that happened to Katniss felt like was happening to me! I couldn't put it down. Read all 3 books in 2 1/2 days!! Marvelous read ... Too bad the series ended
B005YVTHT0|2.0|It is well thought-out, well-designed, and well-engineered. My one complaint was that it was not entirely &#34;programmable,&#34; as I had expected. If you buy this &#34;wheel&#34; to be used in earlier racing games (GPL, NASCAR 2003), you will have to use some third-party software (e.g., JoyToKey.com) to have it accomplish what the manufacturer software should have accomplished in the first place.  That having been said, for ease of use, transportability, and sheer gaming happiness, this is a stand-alone delight. It has no other flaws.  UPDATE: After several months of use, the spring in the right-lower paddle broke. This is the paddle that will normally be used as the accelerator, so it naturally will be subjected to more use than any other part of the device. I replaced it with a ballpoint pen spring that is significantly weaker. Earlier this year (2015) I bought another SRW-S1; it too broke the same spring within a few months. I attempted to contact the company via their on-site e-mail address but they haven't seen fit to reply to my request for help. I am therefore reducing my original five-star review to two stars.
1401937268|3.0|The cards are really beautiful and certainly exude an otherworldly atmosphere which is magical yet very accessible for readers of all ages and levels.<br />However, there is such a sameness about them, from one card to the next, which is quite uninspiring at times. I did perform several nice readings with it but had to make special effort to distinguish each card from the other, and this prevented me from making more intuitive reads. For meditation purposes or just a pleasant tarot world to visit, it serves quite well. The colors tend to center rather on soft blues which is very soothing but again, makes this deck a bit uniform.<br />Also another quibble I had with this deck is that the cards, in my opinion, are hard to shuffle as they tend to sort of stick to each other due the plastic or glossy finish, which is a shame. Actually I had some of the shrink-wrap-like finish of the cards peel off ever before I had started, leaving a papery undercoat.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|LOVE IT !! Especially love the Demo CD.  Totally Awesome... Raw. Beautifully written, & reworked until 'PERFECTION'! ! !  Amazing ~  Truly amazing.  One of my FM fav's now -
B008Q07GLW|2.0|This is considered a &#34;classic&#34; but I was disappointed as it seemed to me that it was lacking in dialogue and substance. The theme song, &#34;Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,&#34; appeared misplaced and irrelevant.
B000002KXO|5.0|Some of their best songs are on this one, but then... I LOVE ALL Fleetwood Mac's MUSIC !! * Oh Diane ... not much play time here in the U.S., but the Brits got it right, moving it up to the top 10 !! :D
B002PMPTIO|1.0|Unbelievably stupid & disorganized.<br />We stopped the movie about 35-40 mins in.<br />I can't remember the last time my family and I couldn't finish a movie--highly rare.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Never should've ended so fast,................as they later found out.<br />I'm just a sci-fi lover so naturally I liked it.  Who knows how many seasons it could've ran for.
B000JWTX3Y|2.0|this movie sucked poor acting performances on both parts I think too generic feel and it wasn't even funny but you can't too much from a romantic comedy i guess.
B0099G3I96|5.0|No Doubt spent the last 9 years pursuing their own projects and collaboration, not to mention spending time with their families. I am so thrilled they took the extra time in writing and putting this album together.<br />Their original Ska sound remains mixed in with a new sound, which works really well. It actually is a merging of all their sounds over the years, from their Beacon Street Collection to Rock Steady. The deluxe 2 disc set is a great set because it includes remixes and acoustic versions of some of their songs. Both studio and the aforementioned versions sound simply amazing. There is no favorite as each song is unique. The lyrics tell stories of their lives over the years, which we can all relate to.<br />The best part of Push & Shove CD is it has something for fans that have been following them since the beginning and new fans alike. A long time follower, this fan is looking forward to see what they come up with next!<br />Which ever version you buy, you'll be stoked.<br />[[ASIN:B009B53LA6 Push And Shove (Deluxe Version)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0099G3I96 Push And Shove]]
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I liked the surprise ending - don't want to spoil it here but like how they showed that there is a past and significant relationship between K and J.
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  They tackle some taboo topics in middle class Catholic society and help you to see that the human connection looks and comes in many different packages and even if you are &#34;whole&#34; you can still need someone to fix you.  Good mix of humor and touchy feely stuff.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is a very unique singer!  What a voice!<br />This is a must for anyone who loves and appreciates good<br />music.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was really cute. It made me think about my relationship and how much my fiancée saved me from things in my past. This book made me fall more in love with my fiancée.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Got here fast! Like next day fast!! You guys are awsome and I've been meaning to buy this movie for like 9 years now:)
B005LAII12|4.0|Movie was really funny. It was a great movie to watch on a snowy day in New England. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for a great comedy.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|One of my top favorite and now I have it in my hot lil hands! Product came to my home faster than I thought it would.<br />Thanks
B005LAIH4A|5.0|great kid movie that adults can enjoy as well  love dr suess no matter what he does  loved them for my kids and now my grand kids
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I've been beefing up my movie collection and had to have this one added! One of my favorite books and movies!
B008602KQI|5.0|The underlying message of BIG BROTHER manipulating life is alittle disturbing to see on the big screen but if you over look that aspect and just watch the movie as a movie it is GREAT
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Everyone knows what a great businessman Mark Cuban is, however, this book does a good job of showing how he wasn't an overnight sensation, he worked his a** off for years before truly &#34;making it&#34; as we know him today.  Would recommend to anyone interested in their own business.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|lots of action and it is a movie that the entire family can watch together and enjoy without any issues
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the best book ive read recently! I couldnt put it down once i started reading! It was addicting!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Lead to believe this browser would work on Kindle Fire HD and allow me to watch videos, Kindle indicated it's not compatible.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I definitely will begin paying more for clean meat.  We have cut our consumption to only one meal a day.  I was already buying chicken that was not Tyson but finding grass fed beef is a bit harder and rather expensive.  I will probably just minimize all beef I buy and do more &#34;healthy chicken&#34; and fish.  I ask in restaurants if beef is grass fed (and it never is) and then I order chicken or fish.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and have spent hours playing. there is plenty of variety and levels of challenge to keep you playing.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a classic and one of my favorite movies ever made. The characters in it are great, the storyline while being rather simple is still entertaining, the style of comedy is perfect, and the movie touches on some deep issues rather than just having a fun day off. Recommended for young and old people alike. I'm sure I'll still be watching this movie in 30 years.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show just gets better and better.  I love the development of the characters.  Maggie Smith is so funny and quirky!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The puzzles are really fun to play but they also challenge you to think about what your doing overall a fun game to play that keeps you entertained.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really entertaining very nice graphics.horses are easy to train and the help is very easy to understand. Quick ways to gain levels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book of the series was just as good as the first, continued right on with the story and had a good flow.
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a great app to have to kill time for anyone ages 1-101... I like it myself but it also keeps little kids busy and is easy to play.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all three books in this series. This being the last was very rewarding to read how it all turned out.
B007LB2B3K|4.0|Bought it for a few songs and found a few more in the album that im starting to really like. worth the buy if your into rock. beware, some screamo-type songs are in there too. &#34;Its stupid that im required to type 20 or more words for a review. or that im required to write one at all. the fact that you HAVE to make a title AND a 20 word minimum review is probably keeping a lot of people from reviewing songs. not a smart move, amazon. i already graduated, stop giving me homework.&#34;
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Took way to long to get going and when it did it didn't amount to much.  If you want to see more realistic, non boring proper version of what this series was copied from both the novels and movie check out Battle Royale 1/2.  Far greater films, way more fast paced and doesn't tale 45 mins to get started.  Hunger games is like a watered down, twillight infused, boring version of Battle Royale.  Nothing worth watching more than once, and compared to the book unless you read the book you wont undertsand have the weird crap going on all over the place here and there are parts of this film that will have you facepalming it's that dumb.  Battle Royale is far superior and more worth your time.  Not impressed with Hunger Games wont bother seeing the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that Subway Surfers is a great way to keep kids busy and it is a Really fun game I think that it is perfect for children and,really for anybody.all ages and I love it!! If you haven't go  it yet I think you should!!!
B009IF8CH6|3.0|The show is entertaining to me, but it isn't something that I have to get more of.  It is definitely enjoyable.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|By far the most heart wrenching book I have read in a long time.  Such a brave girl and woman!
B007SGM084|3.0|I thought the books of &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy&#34; were so repetitious it became boring and ho-hum.  I liked the mystery. Would not recommend this set.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This was a very entertaining mini series. I couldn't wait to set time aside to watch each episode. I really have enjoyed it.
B000T433CO|5.0|love the movie, was sent faster than they said  [ love that ]<br />must use these people again if ordering a movie
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Like this app. Simple easy and free to use.<br />I use it a lot and also my mother tends to ask to use it when doing her bills. Great!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love all the games by G5 entertainment just wish they were a lil longer. I never had any problems with them
B00785P2QC|5.0|I luv this game it's like having it own city in the palm of it hands luv the graphics too
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Excellent movie! Great in Blu-ray. Keep your friends close. Keep your enemies even closer. Excellent cast. What more can I say?
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was an easy read, and honestly couldn't put it down until I finished it! It had some unforeseen twists, but in the end I was very pleased with the out come! It makes me want to find the silver lining in my life.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great in Blu-ray. Excellent stories and entertainment. Great cinematography. Snakes. Why does always have to be snakes. I hate snakes! Asps. Very dangerous. YOU go first!
0385528752|4.0|I appreciated that this book used story-telling and analogy to provide ideas on how to motivate others (or ourselves) to change.  The elephant and rider analogy resonated with me and now that I've heard that analogy I now see it appear in everyday situations in my work and personal life.  The book provides practical advice and delivers it in an interesting and memorable way.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|It has room to make it wider and taller. Clasps tightly, and works well.<br /><br />It can tighten on both the twist feature as well as the pivot. Has a soft cushion on bottom portion so there are no scratches on it.
0743270754|5.0|One thing that struck me over and over again while reading the book is the astonishing degree to which characteristics of Lincoln -- background, temperament, intellect, education, personality, judgment, political acumen, etc. -- are similar to those of Barack Obama.  But Obama's attempts to involve his &#34;rivals&#34; on his &#34;team&#34; are often thwarted by other &#34;rivals&#34;!<br /><br />Thank you Doris Kearns Goodwin for this magnificent volume.  Part history, part biography, part politics lesson.  I found the book hard to put down.  So much to learn from this book on many levels.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I have never wrote a review online before, but I feel compelled to do so for this movie. I purchased this movie with high expectations, and I feel I was severely disappointed. The reviews for this movie were very high and I had heard nothing but praise for how great it was. Beware, it isn't that great. Daniel Craig was very good in the role of James Bond, but he fell through the cracks of a weak/predictable script that lowered the effectiveness of the other characters and the movie itself. While the action and cinematography were very good, it didn't make up for the fact that you can watch movies with similar scenarios that have a much lower budget and lower expectations. My attention wasn't held enough to think of this than more than an average action movie. Casino Royal had a great script, characters, and was a great Bond movie. Quantum of Solace and Skyfall,in my opinion, are about the same level of movie with interesting characters and weak/predictable scripts. I would advise renting the movie before deciding on whether or not to buy it.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Normally I am not a fan of gratuitous movie violence, but in this case the violence was a key part of the story.  This is an must-see movie with a great storyline & excellent acting all around.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Live Who?  Yes Please!!!  Great as always!  I'll buy any live Who that's available.  Don't think there's much (if any) I'm missing, but I'm always looking!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I am a huge fan of the original series & recently re-watched it in its entirety.  This series is entertaining but lacks the true cultural divide of upstairs & downstairs, which made the original series so compelling.  But, it is worth watching.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It a fun twist to the angry bird line up... Today meets angry bird. FUN FUN FUN the game also has updates to give you more more more
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This little volume not quite literally fell off a library shelf in the 1970s and hit me in the head.  I'd never heard of it, but borrowed it and was highly moved.  By the 90s, some prominent source labelled it one of the 10 most influential books. I have since purchased it several times--and given all of them away.  Now have it on my Kindle.  It's well worth your reading time.  Can't speak to the quality of the digital version as I haven't reread it yet.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This book is great!It would be perfect for a high school student to read for a book report or something.My eleven year old son read this book and said it was hard to follow, so it is probably better for sophomores to early college students to read this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book awhile ago and when I saw they made a movie from it, I decided to read it again.  I am glad I did.  I enjoyed it just as much the second time.  Cannot wait to see the movie.
B00846F1YW|1.0|Despite the glowing reviews I read, this game is a flop. Some said it was challenging- i disagree. It is so easy my 7 year old could play it.  I thought it was boring, the plot was weak, and the constant and long dialogues were annoying.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its a really good game, but, whenever I try to load it up sometimes it quits itself. But overall, its really good!(:
B000002OCP|4.0|Luckily for me, I listened to Electric Mud on 8-track when I was a kid in high school, way before ever hearing any other Muddy recordings. It was one of our favorites to crank up and party and dance and smoke to so I was shocked to later learn what a bad reputation this record had. But I can hear why purists would pan this, unfortunately it rocks and grooves real well. If you listen with a fresh attitude you will enjoy muddy getting all \\"electric\\". especially fine is Herbert Harper's Free Press.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This man is every girls dream and he keeps chasing after what he knows he wants. The twist and turns of this story keeps you hooked!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Excellent and well researched - Discovered that I am gluten intollerant.  I stopped eating any foods/drink that had wheat flour and after 4 weeks was pain free (muscle/joints), no longer had debilitating tiredness and lost weight (7 lbs.).  I had my doctor add this food alergy to my medical file.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was not the ending I expected but wow what a heart wrenching story that keeps you wondering if this could really happen.
B00112ASYO|5.0|Real looking, great for displaying or play for my grandson who loves wild animals, it is not too small, true image is what you get.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story line is perfect and the suspense is amazing. Very well written and there are surprises around every corner. Keeps you hooked!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|and found it with &#34;Me Before You&#34;.  I'm truly glad I found this book and a new author I had not known before reading this book.  Although this book is fiction, the issues in it, are real.  I loved the realization of the issues, the fantastic storyline, the evolution of the characters, and the author is now on my top 10 list.  I highly recommend this book to people who are tired of reading the same thing over and over but with name changes.... if that is the case, definitely try this book.  You want be disappointed.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|This is pretends to be a new kind of boy pursues girls story -- boy meets girl but girl thinks she doesn't have time for anything more than sex. When things get close, girl rejects boy. Boy starts dating others. Girl realizes she actually loves him and has to be his one and only.<br /><br />The premise makes a sideways glance at the idea of friends with benefits -- relationships that say a couple can have sex without all the traditional levels of commitment, but does nothing to explore the idea.<br /><br />Likewise, the story does little to add any depth to the old fashioned romance story it actually is.<br /><br />Low marks for innovation, low marks for elegance in retelling a timeworn stereotype.<br /><br />Add to that, the male lead has no charisma and his character has few elements to make him interesting. A little character depth for both the boy and the girl character would have added a lot.<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this app! Puzzle and problem solving skills needed, fast play. Visually enjoyable. Love when it says PERFECT, I feel like a little kid who git an A on a project.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I figured for the price i was paying i would get a power cord with it.  So far nothing else seems wrong with it but as of right now i'm skeptical.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I listened only to this album for about a month.  Ihave been a huge fan of twenty one pilots for over a year and a half now and I always will be.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|I have two ATVs, so I bought this, to be able to have a RAM mounting point on each ATV.<br />Simple, works good for its purpose.<br />I might add, after mounting it, you may want to trim the ends of the U-bolt, if they stick up very far so you don't snag anything on them.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is a awesome Soundtrack this soundtrack is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great sequel and I really like all the added features. My children are playing this game constantly.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|The best book ever I couldn't stop reading it at school or home no matter how much they told me to stop reading
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I've been reading how to publish on Kindle, and this is one of the best books I have seen.  It made things easy to figure out and supplemented other books I have read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME! If you want a game to keep you occupied then get this game, you will enjoy and love it, especially if you have kids they will love it too!
1475143389|5.0|Mike Matthews hit it right on the head!  With working out, it should be as basic as possible with a strong regard for diet relative to your goals.  Whether it be building muscle or burning fat, Mike does an excellent job explaining what needs to be done to get real, long term results.  There is no non-sense about workout and rep scheme changes and doing one legged squats on a BOSU ball or whatever that thing is called.  Lifting heavy and dieting to your current needs and goals is all it takes.  This is just straight to the point, but yet very informative on the step by step process of building your best body.  Great job, Mike!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great book Lyman Frank is the best author ever I love this book so much it is so fascinating that's what I think about this book
B007REV4T8|1.0|**Spoilers**<br />This movie is insulting to the Bond legacy and it's shameful that this is what they put out as the 50th anniversary chapter.  \\"Magic\\" guns, ridiculous plot holes and a PC gay villain was too much.  With the Roger Moore/70s days, completely ridiculous  action and plot holes were part of the gag.  These modern Bond movies have generally been well-made and technically correct other than the made up gadgets.  This one attempts to be serious yet asks us to believe complete stupidity from \\"trained agents\\", magical computer hacking and firearms with seemingly unlimited clips.  Trashing the DB (kept in a side street garage but still found clean and restored) wasn't just a cheesy nod but also disrespectful to fans.  I guess they are trying to say that they are leaving the \\"old Bond\\" behind for the next half century but that is the Bond that most fans want.  The \\"dramatic\\" death scene of M who manages to hike across a big field and deal with the villain while hardly showing any discomfort after being shot but dies in Bond's arms after their necessary good-bye dialogue made me laugh.<br />I've lost all faith in the Bond series now.  Who directs next, JJ Abrams???  What a joke.
B00A757EFW|3.0|JUST GOT IT AND HAVE NOT PLAYED IT MUCH. SO REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT. WHY MORE WORDS.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|... eventually you would want to pay real money and some of the prices are too high. but all in all its very cute.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|a friend of mine let me listen to this band and i brought it.  i enjoy listening to them. thanks
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This book is a classic but one of my favorites. Bringing me through many emotions and allowing me to escape my own worries for a moment of laugh and cries
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Gets a little creepy how much it wants u to stroke and rub the horse. Fun if u r bored enough
0061692034|2.0|This is one book YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY about SPOILERS!<br /><br />Why?  Read on...<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I already know a lot of people like this book. But suffice it to say that I have read over a third of the book -- I'm read through Chapter 25, for heaven's sake, and...<br /><br />I absolutely have no idea why anyone likes it.<br /><br />If you're thinking of reading this you probably already have some idea what the book is about: parents of twins rob a bank; get arrested, and the twins fend for themselves.  Only...<br /><br />Only, apparently, there's more, but someone else is going to have to tell me about it.  This book would bore a tollgate collector.<br /><br />The book starts by saying \\"First I'll tell you about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.\\"  Well, he was being honest about that...he certainly tells us about it...and about it...and about it...<br /><br />This isn't the slightest exaggeration: before the robbery begins (the details of which last hardly longer than a chapter or so), the author reminds us of this fact DOZENS of times.  I'm not joking. Dozens. And while I am sure there are many who will say well, of course, this is the formative event of their lives...it bears repeating.  Sure, I agree.  But the unending references become monotonous and deaden any narrative flow the already thin plot line has built up.<br /><br />I wanted to give it more time...I'd waited some time to get the book from my library and I also hate giving upon a thing I've been looking forward to.  But really: TWENTY-FIVE CHAPTERS?  Isn't that a sizeable investment?  Shouldn't I have encountered SOMETHING that caught my eye by then?<br /><br />Here's what I know by now: Mom and Dad were very different from each other, and probably shouldn't have gotten married. Dell and Berner, the twins, are different from each other. The family often moves. Everybody thinks a lot. But nobody's very smart.<br /><br />That's about it.  That's what I got from reading twenty-five chapters.<br /><br />Look; I'm sure the book has its fans. Richard Ford has written a dozen or so works, and is critically acclaimed.  At the time of this writing some 60 percent gave it a four or a five. But as a person who falls into the almost 25 percent who gave it a one or two might say...<br /><br />It's bye, bye, \\"Canada.\\"out it.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|A nice movie full of interesting characters.  Makes me want to find a place like this and travel there! Beautiful!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Really unusual premis but the story worked and was a fast read. I enjoyed the characters. Nice story forbedtime reading.
0143039431|3.0|I've been re-reading some the books I read 40-50 years ago.  Some were required reading, others not.  Many read better after you have more life experience behind you.  For example Dickens, Hemmingway, Twain.  There are things in those books you simply couldn't see or understand when younger. Little of that applies to The Grapes of Wrath.  Even setting aside the tedious political and economic naïvet&eacute; of the author, the treatment of the principle characters is condescending and stereotypical. They are cardboard Hollywood caricatures.  Maybe that is why it was turned so successfully in to a movie.<br /><br />I have/had parents and grandparents with dust bowl and southern California connections to that period so I have real people with which to compare the characters in the book.  Perhaps the disconnect between Steinbeck's imagination and real people I knew is why I can't suspend disbelief.<br /><br />In sum, the book is interesting from the point of view of literary history, but if you want a good read try one of authors listed earlier, or even Bronte or Austen if your taste runs that direction.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|As the previous reviewer said, you won't find a game like this that is as well made and polished, aside from a cute little game, it's very fun and addictive as well.The only issue I have is that to completely close and exit out of the game you have to either force close it or kill it with a task manager.Usually I give low ratings for games of this nature, because it feels unfinished, but in this game's special case, five stars across the board! Well worth the download!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|and 80 minutes of Alcoholics anonymous somehow left me wanting more.  More about the flight investigation, more about NTSB procedures, more about the crash...too much AA.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|By now, you know the premise of Lost in Austen. On many levels it works excellently and on some it...just doesn't and those bad moments take away from the picture on a whole. (Spoilers ahead)<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />1. The casting is excellent.<br />Jemima Rooper and Elliot Cowan bring serious sizzle to their roles of Amanda Price and Mr. Darcy, respectively. I love spunky, emotional Amanda, who tries her best to stay close to the premise of P&P, but mucks up everything. At first, I didn't warm to Cowan (too much squinting and glowering I felt at first) but the repressed passion and UST he delivers is ridiculously off the charts. Consider the scene where he tells Amanda she repels him. On one level, everything he says is correct, but on another, she clearly affects him in a way he finds most uncomfortable and that feeling repels him even as it attracts him to her (parsonage scene). Lovely bit of acting in both parts. The wet shirt scene is drool, freeze-frame worthy, I mean seriously, the man is gorgeous!!!! Alex Kingston shines as the motherly but ditzy Mrs. Bennet, while the others bring alive what I've always considered to be two-dimensional characters, in particular Morven Christie (Jane Bennet) andTom Mison as Mr. Bingley (more on them below)<br /><br />2. Plot twists are unconventional, but work (for the most part)<br />The Jane and Charles twist was excellent! I've always thought of Jane and Bingley in the original P&P as plot devices rather than fully fleshed out characters. Here, it's a delight to see two essentially weak people having to come to terms with hard life choices. Excellent acting, so much so, it almost stole the screen time of the two main characters, Amanda and Darcy. The Wickham/Georgiana reveal was nicely played as well. Again Wickham/Georgiana more of a plot device in the original text, but here there are many shades of grey. Love it!<br /><br />3. The little LOLs count<br />Amanda furiously brushing her teeth on her return to her time. That's exactly what I would've done. Mrs. Bennet sinking into a deep curtsy for Mr. Darcy at Pemberly, so deep it was as if she was greeting royalty. Mr. Bennet examining what looked suspiciously like a marijuana leaf. Amanda singing Downtown and Darcy's smirk of reluctant appreciation; Amanda's post-modern moment :) I know and concur!<br /><br />There's much more I can say, but I have to get to...<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD<br /><br />1. The ending.<br />While I wanted Amanda to have her happy moment and the love of her life, I mean it's canon. Darcy and Elizabeth belong together, fullstop the end. It was a risky ploy having her end up with Darcy, and I actually would have preferred her to love and lose Darcy (in that time I mean) and have her go back to her time and meet her own Darcy (a descendant of the original delicious Darcy).<br /><br />2. Mr. Bennet<br />The actor was fine, but the character was written as a little too easygoing. He just trusts Amanda because Lizzy says so? No concern over his favourite daughter going off apparently in the middle of the night to Hammersmith? Brushing off Mrs. Bennet actual legitimate concerns? Nah.<br /><br />3. Caroline's reveal<br />Well played by the actresses, but a little too soapy for me. No thanks.<br /><br />4. The pacing between Amanda and Darcy<br />He hated her, apologised for being wrong, confessed his love rather quickly after that, and then withdrew it after finding out Amanda wasn't a virgin, proposed to Caroline, followed Amanda to the future, said he loved her again, then decided to try with Lizzy, then back to Amanda. Phew, it was too much back and forward and I blame the writers here. Overly complicating things just made it more difficult to understand exactly how, why and when he had fallen in love with her, even to follow her to another time.<br /><br />5. The comment about negroes on the bus. That was just really awkward. We know he was from a different time but there were many other ways that could have been shown.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth it to watch it over and over again, as I have, and it's a good show, just not worth 5 stars.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|This little book just wasn't what I was expecting.  It's basically just some cartoon drawings with a short sentence with each one.  It will probably take you all of ten minutes to read it.  If it's free there are a few cute bits.  But I sure wouldn't buy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers! It is a great game! AND...Wait for IT--FREE!!! Very fun. Also try Temple Run 1 and 2!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A little predictable but sometimes I like that .....<br />The book reminds you what is important and how love was suppose to be.
B00B2EWBMI|4.0|Great kungfu. Will defiantly watch more than once.<br />Riza did a great job directing.<br />The story line was also good.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Ben Afflect does a good job putting together all the historical details. They even impersonate the real life characters very well - At the end od movie, they show real pictures and have interviews with the 6 &#34; houseguest&#34; of the Canadian Ambassador. Based on a true story, they manage to tell a good story with all the suspence of fiction. Kept you bitting your nails , until they leave Iranian airspace.  I really liked the movie , but could not watch twice. The demonstators got on my nerves. Ill try watching again and Fast Forward through those scenes.  Watch the end with the extra interviews and pictures
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was an interesting story of a woman's journey to understand her own life and come to grips with her mother's life and death.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|This was a really great action movie with an awesome plot. It has been one of the better releases in the past year. I did not like this one as much as the dark knight but it is still an amazing movie. The clarity of this in bluray is amazing!
B005721W9O|4.0|It's hard to find a movie everyone in the family can enjoy, but this worked for our geeky family. Also, Alan Rickman is in it, complete with strange alien head prosthetics! (Ten points from Griff--er, fire up the spaceship.)
0345803485|3.0|Alright so I will admit I did sit down and read this book after hearing all the hype. I had to see what it was like! I enjoy reads that make you want to keep reading and I will say this one did make you want to see what happened next. The writing style is very basic and seems almost humorous at points by the repetition the author uses. It really reminded me of the twilight series without supernatural beings just the super rich instead. All in all it is not a terrible read and worth a few $$ if you have time to read it. I would not go out of my way to read it though. I do not want to give any specifics away in case you haven't read it. This book is a very easy read with an okay plot line, but it will capture you in the book at times which is always great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins did a great job of keeping the reader guessing what was happening next in this story. She weaves the story with interesting characters and an intriguing plot. I liked it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I loved Brave from start to finish. It is most likely my number one movie for 2012. The storyline is very good, the scenes are breathtaking, and the movie in a whole brings you into the story. Disney and Pixar did a top notch job on this movie. I still cannot get over how beautiful the animated scenes are. Brave had a great storyline to it, and everything about it was very good. My little sister who is 12 loved Brave, but I think I actually liked it more. Great job Disney. The characters were all very good in the movie, and the voices matched perfectly to the characters.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I have said this before anything Sony has been a safe bet. With this turntable it has not let me down yet. My only issue is the editing software for me not being too technically advanced I found the cuing of songs was inaccurate. The actual editing was tricky not a user friendly program.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I ended up seeing this movie in theaters and will be purchasing this from amazon. I watched all of the new animated films that came out in the past few months or so and this by far is one of the best I have seen. It is one of the best video game movies ever, and really keeps you entertained from start to finish. The visuals in this movie are phenomenal and take your breath away. All of the characters have a good history that is given to you and they are very life like. I am amazed how much wreck it ralph is all over the place now online. The movie breathed new life into the classic game. This is a great Disney movie that will surely be a classic.
0547848412|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a page turner.  The descriptions of all that happened to Pi and Richard Parker as well as all the animals was so realistic.  I went to see the movie after reading the book and it too was worth it.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be truly entertained.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was very excited to see that they were offering the ad free version for free. I think angry birds rio is the best one. The colors in this one are so rich and vibrant. The gameplay is a blast. The sounds are very good in rio. It makes it a top notch mobile game!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The best acting and story line in decades.  I was addicted.  Can't wait for season 2 & 3!!  Don't miss!
