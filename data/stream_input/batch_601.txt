B0000524CY|4.0|Through the years, the popular superstitions have found countless episodes of  apparitions and demons. The famous incident occurred in Loudun `s province in 1638 (go for this chronicle widely documented and zealously analyzed by Aldous Huxley) would demonstrate the powerful truth three centuries later, but as we know, these stories feed the popular imagination around the world; becoming a sort of adult tales where the terror by the unknown takes the role of the perpetual love in the fairy tales. On the other hand it results too much easier (Fahrenheit 451) to watch a movie instead of reading a book.<br /><br />And 1973 was the year; a 12 years child will be possessed by the Demon due a simple game (which curious or ironically achieved major notoriety); and this time a priest will become an epic hero when he decides by all means to avoid the eternal possession; but beware my fellow iron stomachs and squeamish; because you will experience serious nightmares with turning heads colored with green color.<br /><br />Due unexplainable reasons, this film was nominated to Academy Awards, proving once more the concept of cinema as device of artistic expression was again carved in relief. At last the girl was saved and the film too, from being awarded, thanks God.<br /><br />One more thing: the new generations have been faced against such extreme doses of of graphic and explicit violence, that hardly we should expect their reactions may be able to generate the cathartic experience experienced for those generation of viewers, so don't be scared in case you obtain an answer as I personally got from a thirteen years old one year ago: just a cool entertainment.<br /><br />As you know, the things change.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Given that virtually every up-and-coming musical act gets hyped beyond the point of consumer exhaustion, it's tempting to automatically reject the artist along with the hype.  Not a good idea though, particularly if it means missing that occasional album that really deserves one's lasting attention.  Which brings us to UK soul artist Corinne Bailey Rae, who has really put together a special debut from the first cut to the last.  Without exception her vocals go deep, as do her songs (all of which she wrote or co-wrote).  It's ironic that star performers whom are considerably older than Corinne find the need to revamp themselves in the image of certain lightweight teenage acts.  Then here comes someone in her twenties who has a mature musical point of view and an image to match.  Without even trying, Corinne is making some top-selling predecessors look even more skanky and desperate for attention than they already were.      <br /> <br />I can repeat what other reviewers here have praised about Corinne's music, and I think I will by echoing those who see this album as bridging the most timeless soul/r&b classics of the past with subtle contemporary production touches.  Corinne deserves better than to be compared to others, but as a general point of reference: if you're into the likes of Alicia Keys and other talented nu-soul artists (Amel Larrieux, Monday Michiru, etc.), it's hard to imagine that you'll be anything less than thrilled by Corinne's music.  One thing that contributes to the album's success is that although the soulful production and arrangements do have a contemporary vibe, thankfully the tracks aren't turned into generic audio wallpaper via cookie-cutter beats, guest rappers, and over-exposed producers.  Corinne is making waves by sticking to her musical strengths, rather than diluting her talent via ingredients with a six-month shelf life.  As such, perhaps there is no quantity of obvious hit singles here, but who cares when there's musical quality throughout.  Hopefully we'll be able to say that about future albums by Corinne Bailey Rae.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|Thanks be to the act of providence responsible for Philip Glass creating this score for the soundtrack of the movie The Hours. <br />   Glass, the greatest composer of our time, has created a perfect score, an inspired work that not only complements, but melds beautifully with and becomes one with the film's disparate emotions and images. Film and score seem to have sprung from the same artistic womb. It's hard to imagine one without the other. This is a composition by turns as serene then turbulent as the River Ouse Virginia Woolf drowned herself in. Beautiful, yet emotionally draining, with unresolved chords mirroring the complex biographies, the tormented emotional landscapes of the story's characters. <br />   It would have been easy for the film's producers to have chosen a forgettable composer and score that would have played on sentimentality and the maudlin and cheapened a great film. With Glass' inspired piece, the  film is greatly elevated and becomes something quite fine and rare.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This is the best Sigur ros album yet. It seems the band adds on instruments from each recording. For example, the same glockenspiel type instrument that was used on Tiki. It is a good sign that the band is building upon its previous recordings. This is right up there with Agaetis Byrjun, if not better.
B000002UAO|5.0|I've been getting into the Beatles recently, having grown up on their Brit-invasion pop songs that were always played on the radio station my mother listened to, carting my sisters and I around from one appointment, game, event, friend's house to another when we were younger. <br />Well, anyway, I've been moving through their albums with little direction, and after starting with Sgt. Peppers, I came to this.  I've since gone on to most of their other albums, but I keep coming back to this one.  From beginning to end, this album is absolutely fantastic - I especially love the last half, from \\"What Goes On\\" to the end.  What a great finish to an album, one so strong throughout.  I can't imagine how this would've blown me away were I listening to it in 1965, but even today it's right up there as one of my favorite albums.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars is one fo the best shows ever,just ask Joss Whedon! The Second season has even more twists and turns than the first season ,Veronica  matures as she awaits the trial for her friend's death. The season opener starts with a bus crash which becomes the main focus of the season,which is solved in the season finale (you'll never guess who blew up the bus)! This season introduces new characters (kendall casablancas and the shady mayor goodman)and loses old ones(Duncan)  Way better than the first season by far. <br />*can't wait for season three on the CW* <br />
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I have heard of Korn since i was in the 8th Grade and never really gave them a notice. The last six albums they released i didnt really care for. never listened to them, mostly because i didnt really find Korn all that great. So i passed on the albums. Then came the new single \\"Twisted Transistor\\". As soon as i heard it i new i had to pick up \\"See You On The Other Side'. Many fans thought Korn would fade away once they heard that Brian \\"Head\\" Welch was leaving. Well, Korn moved on and made one hell of an album. \\"Twisted Transistor\\" is awesome, with its cool guitar playing and effects. \\"Coming Undone\\" is pure rock from the beginning with the hard guitar starting it off and drumming that sounds alot like Queens' \\"We Will Rock You\\". I would also like to point out \\"Politics', \\"Hypocrites\\",\\"Liar\\", \\"Souvenir\\", \\" 10 or a 2 Way\\", \\" Love Song\\", \\"Getting Off\\" and \\"For No One\\", as songs that also rock on this album. So those fans who think Korn lost Theire hard edge need to WAKE UP! and see that Korn is still just as hard as they ever were. Everyone who enjoys listening to hard rock needs to pick up \\" See You On The Other Side\\". it will not dissapoint.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Damian has certainly grown spiritually through his music. This was a uplifting album.<br /><br />I loved it...especially the speeches of HIM and Marcus Garvey in between the songs.
B000777J2S|4.0|I like it. The voice is surprising, takes some getting used to, but I like it very much. I like that all the songs don't sound alike.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I loved the series on HBO and watched it again on basic cable... But, being able to watch this again, sans commercials, is priceless.
0380789019|5.0|This was my second Gaiman novel and my favorite so far...I was immediately drawn in and found it hard to put down. I loved the characters, the witty sense of humor and the mythical imagry. I still want to know more about London Underground and the characters who live, survive and rule in that dimension. Gaiman is a great storyteller with a very vivid imagination. Having recently visited London, made the book even more fun. I loved this book!
B000FGGE68|1.0|In the second LONE WOLF & CUB film (KOZURE ÔKAMI: SANZU NO KAWA NO UBAGURUMA), a wounded Ogami Itto (Tomisaburo Wakayama) confronts his enemies at a well.  Bound and hanging over its mouth is his son, Daigoro (Akihiro Tomikawa).  The boy kicks off a sandal, sending it plummeting into the inky darkness below.  Ogami measures the seconds until he hears the gentle \\"plop\\" of the sandal meeting the deep water before beginning the obliteration of his foes.  Engaged in combat, the man who held Daigoro's rope allows the boy to fall.  Ogami slices his way through the group to grab the rope in time to save his son.<br /><br />  A well in 1800s rural Japan makes sense.  A well in a church \\"somewhere in the future\\" doesn't.  Yet, that's par for the course with ULTRAVIOLET, a quasi-vampire action film from writer/director Kurt Wimmer.  The latest in the \\"created in a computer\\" movies (think SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW or CASSHERN), Wimmer's tale is long on exposition, heavy in style, and thin on substance.<br /><br />Along with LONE WOLF & CUB, ULTRAVIOLET borrows heavily from THE MATRIX, BLADE, AEON FLUX, and a host of video games and comic books.  Rather than being a clever amalgam, Wimmer's work is a messy hodgepodge that brims with tepid gunfights and excessive chase scenes.
0441003257|4.0|I think it was the comparison to Hitchhiker's Guide that prompted me to purchase Good Omens and I'm glad I did. It's definatley a different kind of book, with the side notations and the references to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter.  How is the Apocalyspe funny? You'll have to read it to believe it. I bet you like the antichrist, too.
1400079179|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is fast-paced and exciting, and written in an easy and engaging style. It appears somewhat influenced by Hollywood, with its characterization and slightly disbelief-suspending plot. The main characters seem to be able to get out of every situation, surviving life-threatening encounters so often that you start to believe them to be untouchable rather than smart-thinking.<br /><br />The concept of a secret code is based on the gnostic gospels, and the book characterizes Catholicism in a less-than-favorable light, glorifying Langdon and Neveu, the investigators and protagonists, as heroes. Because of this, it can be seen as offensive. However, with such a fictional style as this, it is hard to take Brown wholly seriously in his claims.<br /><br />An easy and enjoyable read; an interesting concept but one that I would only explore with imagination.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|...in the muddy and muffled sound of ALL previous reissues and remasters of Eat a Peach, including the MFSL release, you're in luck. This edition finally fixes those issues, and I must say that it truly sounds beautiful. They either found a much better tape or they did a sonic restoration job on it, because there's no comparison to anything that has come before it. If you like (or love) this album, you won't regret buying this. To top it all off, it includes the entire June 27, 1971 Fillmore East concert, and it sounds great too, even though the mixing is a little questionable.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The beauty of Music, like every art form, lies squarely in the eye/ear of the beholder.  Those who can not find the beauty in this album simply lack the personal experiences (careful what you wish for) necessary to absorb the lyrics, the instrumentation, the emotion entwined throughout.   <br /> <br />To hold a hand that withers under the onslaught of cancer, to engage a mind that is no longer aware of itself, to peer into eyes that only see their next fix...life's lessons only those that have been there, this side or the other, can truly comprehend.  Give thanks that you can't relate and pray you never will.  And be forewarned, hypothetical opinions on the face of misery may be an assault to those whose misfortunes make them wiser than you. <br /> <br />As an aside, there are a number of social and political insights (Vicarious, The Pot, Right in Two) that capture the self-destructive nature of our desires, our institutions, our race.  Few of the tube can deny the message.  Fewer will choose to debate the meaning, decry the medium and that is a shame.  I applaud Tool for redirecting our attention, if only for an instant; however, in a world that chooses common cents over common sense, only true Nerve can rewire the World.   <br />
B000065DWH|5.0|I love this album, it's so great! Every song is just to die for! As a song writer and piano player/drummer I find the music to be in good taste as well. I can't stop listening to it! If it weren't for this album I probly wouldn't like Randy at all, but now I'm nuts for him! I can't say enough about it. Go listen to it!

B00005JOQS|5.0|The Man of Steel has made a welcome return after years absent from the big screen and two dreadful sequels that most superhero fans want to forget.  Bryan Singer, best known for his direction of the box office hits, X-Men 1 & 2, gives the viewers a movie that honors the beloved American icon and wisely ignores the two sequels that pretty much killed off the Superman franchise.<br /><br />The plot begins 5 years after the ending of the second Superman  movie.  Superman, having gone off to find his home world, Krypton and finding nothing, returns to Earth to find Lois moving on with her life, now a mother and a Putlizer prize winner, not to mention the fiancee of Richard White, nephew of Daily Globe editor, Perry White.  While gone, Lex Luthor, Superman's nemesis has been released from prison, bamboozled a rich old lady out of her money and set into action a wicked plan that will doom billions of people.  The storyline places Superman face to face with Luthor as well as placing him as the guardian of Metropolis and the world.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is a perfect selection for Clark Kent/Superman.  With his clean cut good looks and charming smile, he easily fills the red boots vacated by Christopher Reeve, to whom along with his wife, Dana, the movie is dedicated.  There are times when Routh looks uncannily like his predecessor.  He is perfect for the role and I look forward to seeing him in the inevitable sequels.  Kate Bosworth is also good as Lois Lane.  I wasn't impressed with the casting of Ms. Bosworth as Lois when I first heard, but I think she gave a nice performance.  My biggest disappointment, is with the casting that I most looked forward to-----Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  I guess I just expected more.  He didn't seem to fully throw himself into the role and Parker Posey as his moll, Kitty, stole all of her scenes with him.  And one other trivial comment---someone give Lois' son, Jason, a haircut, please!  He looks like they pulled him out of a cave, where he was raised by wolves!!<br /><br />The special effects are impressive.  The whole sequence with the airplane is worth the ticket price alone but there are other great action sequences in the film.  The flying effects are so much more advanced from the other films and it really looks so much more convincing.  One of my favorite scenes, which I think is quite romantic, is when Superman first confronts Lois about his disappearance, taking her for a ride above the clouds where he offers a simple but heart-felt apology.  Bryan Singer apparently loves these type of films and puts a lot of heart and effort into them.  I hope that he will direct the sequel before he flies off to another project!<br /><br />This movie has a lot to live up to and must certainly justify its pricey film budget.  While it wasn't as perfect as Spiderman 2, this is a great superhero film and a must see on the silver screen.  I gave the film 5 stars because of Brandon Routh, the special effects and the direction of Bryan Singer.  If I could have, I would have taken a half a star for Spacey's lack luster performance.  Otherwise, this is a near perfect superhero movie.<br /><br />If you are looking for action-packed summer entertainment, this is it.  Grab your popcorn, sit back, and become a kid again...wishing you could fly too!here he was raised by wolves!! <br /> <br />The special effects are impressive.

B0000640SA|5.0|This is a great DVD for all collections even if the movie stank which it did not.  The package is worth the coin.
6305784116|5.0|You don't really realize how violent the Disney classics are until you want to watch one of them with a toddler. In most of the movies, one of the main characters is orphaned and/or some violent act occurs in the beginning of the story.  We'd rather not have our young children exposed to these frightening scenes so we have not shown very many of the Disney movies to our young daughters yet.   <br /> <br />The Aristocrats on the other hand is a great story for youngsters. Although the butler does give the cats something to make them sleep and he tries to take them away, it is done so hysterically that it isn't the least bit frightening.  The whole movie is charming. My toddlers love it! <br />
B0002B15WE|5.0|When the action gets going, it's easy to see how this movie became as popular as it did. The action is fast-paced and there is no stoping it once it gets started. Bruce Willis does an excellent job in this film as the hero, it's easy to see how he became a huge success after this film. My hat's off to Alan Rickman as well, his portrayal of the villian was as equally impressive. This film is the definition of exciting and after all of these years, the movie is still as fresh as it was when it was originall released. This isn't your typical 80's action flick, this movie has a staying power that will be popular for generations to come! It's very well made, exciting adventure that you have to see if you haven't already!
B000FMGTTE|5.0|This is an excellent musical score by John Ottman.  He really takes the listener on an emotional rollercoaster. I love the track Main Title Superman theme.  This track makes me feel brave and fearless.  Bank Job is a nice track that conveys a sense of evil wrongdoing.  Little Secrets and Power of the Sun conveyed the emotion of wonder and discovery. I could feel the tension mounting on the  track Rough Flight.  I felt a feeling of dread listening to the track So Long Superman.  Another good track is Not Like The Train Set.  I felt a sense of danger and struggle here.  I really liked the track Fly Away.  It sounds so peaceful and romantic.  Saving The World has a very heroic and noble feel to it.  I enjoyed listening to this score very much.

B0002W18MU|5.0|Johnny Cash will always be one of my favorite singers.  His low rich distinctive voice conveyed a range of emotions.  I don't have any of the other CD's in the American series, but I loved the variety of themes on these recordings.  Help Me, I Came To Believe and God's Gonna Cut You Down are three songs that show that he a deep faith in God.  Rose In My Heart and Love's Been Good to Me are beautiful love songs.  If You Could Read My Mind is another standout love song on here.  I'm Free From The Chain Gang is another highlight.  This is an excellent song about appreciating your freedom after getting out of prison.  He really sings from the heart on this song.  Like the 309 and Further Up On the Road are two beautiful songs about death and approaching the end of life.  I loved listening to the final recordings of Johnny Cash.  I wouldn't be surprised if producer Rick Rubin received a Grammy for his work on this album.
B000002BHE|4.0|Any Celine fan will welcome this album into a collection.Jazzy, snazzy, typical hot celine. Any Celine love song is always a smash, but \\"falling into you\\" might be one of the best.
B000FGGE68|1.0|Do NOT rent or buy this movie! <br /> <br />I had seen some bad reviews, but I like Mila Jojvovich <br />and the movie was made by the same people who made <br />\\"Equilibrium\\" which I totally LOVED. <br /> <br />The movie makes Aeon Flux look like award winning stuff. <br />Horrible dialouge, incomplete sets, cheap CGI, and <br />I had lowered my expectations! I give it a complete F <br /> <br />Awful. I have to go rent/buy something good to get the bad  <br />taste out of my brain. <br /> <br />the ISLAND is probably a a C+ compared to this drek. <br />You have been warned - the movie is a debacle. <br /> <br />I would give it a zero if the rating scale allowed it. <br /> <br />I will admit that visually the flaming sword fight had potential <br />but other than that i just began hoping for the end of the movie <br />
B000002C4J|5.0|This one is worth the price just for the theme from \\"Titanic\\" .Who can resist that tearjerker? And who better than Celine to deliver it? Oh by the way, the rest of the album is great also
B0001LJC2K|5.0|first of all, it is a great album, has radiohead influences and its own originality. <br /> <br />a different note, some arrogant kid just launched a paragraph a few pages ago about how Muse is actually from florida and they're just claiming to be from UK for marketing...the muse that made the CD u're reviewing is from UK...arrogance and ignorance unfortuneatly have u confused on the idea that there may be an american band from florida named muse!?!!?  which is in fact the true case.  to quote you...\\"The truth is out there.\\" its just not the first thing u always read.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I didn't start watching Everwood until Season 2 and I really enjoyed it. I think it tells a great story and was sorry to see the show canceled. I am glad they released this DVD set so I could fully understand the story and the characters.  I like the running commentary provided on some of the shows for its insight into the heads of the producers and characters. I also  love the scenery! I hope Season 2 and 3 will be released on DVD with further commentary.

Worth to get!!!!
B00021R7CG|4.0|1990's By Dawn's Early Light is a telefilm adaptation by HBO of William Prochnau's novel \\"Trinity's Child\\". The movie when it first aired on HBO seemed dated since the Soviet Union was ultimately going through its death throes as the military build-up initiated during the Reagan Administration crippled the USSR economically as they too tried to match the build-up in conventional and nuclear forces. But now in the early years of the 21st century with nuclear weapons beginning to proliferate to second-tier nations such as Pakistan, India and soon Iran and North Korea, this film has become more timely.<br /><br />The film is simplicity in the way the plot unfolds. A failed coup by dissident Soviet military commanders fails, but it's after-effects of creating a \\"hot war\\" between the US and the USSR succeeds as both US President and Soviet Premiere make mistakes in their decisions. Decisions heavily influenced by their military commanders who see only black and white in how their respective nations should respond militarily. By Dawn's Early Light shares some similarities to the classic 60's Cold War films like Dr. Strangelove and Fail-Safe. Both films deal with the human frailties and flaws helping influence events that could lead to nuclear armagaddon for the whole planet. By Dawn's Early Light concentrates on several storylines to highlight the stress and difficulties individuals must face to either follow their orders to their inevitable conclusion or allow their conscience to help make their decisions in trying to stop the madness spiraling out of control. Though some people's decisions are left wanting, the film ends with a glimmer of hope that may just bring the world from the brink of annihilation.<br /><br />The acting by the cast of Rebecca DeMornay, Powers Boothe, James Earl Jones, Darrin McGavin, Martin Landau and Rip Torn are well done. Rebeccan DeMornay and Powers Boothe anchor one of the subplots as romantically involved B-52 crew pilots whose conflict comes from their own intimate closeness affecting command decisions and from the stress of families loss by the rest of the bomber crew. Darrin McGavin, Rip Torn and Martin Landau anchor the other subplot of competing Presidents. One a physically incapacitated US leader trying to avert escalating the conflict to the point of no return with another recently sworn in who fears of losing a nuclear war and thus wanting to strike back full and hard. In between these two leaders is the diabolical performance by Rip Torn as a warmongering Army colonel who sees only winning the war as the only objective. For a telefilm the acting is above-par and bordering on excellent. There's not a weak link in this cast.<br /><br />In the end, the film might look abit dated in its production design, but the story itself is very current. What might have been a nice Cold War relic fairy tale when it first aired in 1990 on HBO has taken on more of a cautionary one as more nations begin to acquire nuclear weapons with some of these nations not just enemies of the US and the world in general, but also led by men whose hold on sanity is tenuous at best. By Dawn's Early Light is a great piece political \\"what if\\" that I recommend others to check out and see.comes from their own intimate closeness affecting command decisions and from the stress of families loss by the rest of the bomber crew.

0312330537|5.0|Its a book which starts on a slow note and you are tempted to keep it aside but if go along showing a little bit of patience u realise u would have missed reading the most interesting and one of the finest books ever written.the best part about this book is the way the author describes each thing in such a detailed and an intriguing way...the author talks about his journey starting from the time when he escapes from the prison in australia and comes to bombay,the years he spends in the slums of bombay serving as a doctor, how the people, the city treats him...how attached he finds himself to be after spending some time with the people there and then how ultimately he claims bombay as the best city.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|2003 would go down as the year a master filmmaker emerged from the ranks of the independent circles to the forefront of elite directors. Chan-wook Park was already well-known amongst the indie circuit as an innovative director coming out of South Korea's burgeoning film industry. He'd already released such well-received films as Joint Security Area and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. In fact, the film in question that's propelled Mr. Park to the forefront would be the second part of a film trilogy dealing with the existential nature of vengeance and its effect on all involved. Oldboy follow's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance like a sonic boom and inproves on the first leg of the trilogy in every way.<br /><br />Oldboy at its most basic is a revenge film. It is a film about a man wrongly and mysteriously imprisoned for reasons unknown to him and to the audience. We see Dae-su Oh --- the man in question --- through his 15 years of mysterious imprisonment and we see him change from the Average Joe from before his kidnapping to a taut, volatile and somewhat insane individual whose only goal in life is to find whoever did this to him and make him pay. Dae-su Oh's imprisonment takes a good part in the telling and makes up the first third of the film's tale. As the years go by we see him spiral down to the lowest depths a man can get to before sanity leaves him. There's no evidence that he didn't go insane during his imprisonment, but Park sure does show us scenes that Dae-su Oh's singular focus to find out why he was imprisoned and to exact revenge on this involved might have just unhinged the poor man in the process.<br /><br />The second part of the tale being told occurs the moment Dae-su Oh is suddenly --- as mysteriously as his imprisonment --- released. One moment he's still in his prison where his only contact with the outside world is the TV in his room and then he's on the rooftop of a building with new clothes on and a suitcase with more clothes and his notebooks where he's listed all the names he thinks may have caused him this wrong. From here Dae-su goes on a whirlwind search to find clues and information on who may have imprisoned him. Along the way he meets the young sushi chef Mi-do who seem to have taken some interest in Dae-su Oh's well-being and who slowly falls in love with him. It is their journey through the maze and labyrinth of false leads and trails that dominate the second third of this tale. It is also the part of the film where Dae-su Oh's monster persona takes precedence as he wreaks havoc on anyone and everyone who may have the information he needs to solving the mystery of his imprisonment.<br /><br />Many have already mentioned the wince inducing pliers scenes and the single-take corridor fight scene. But it is the lovemaking scene between Dae-su Oh and Mi-do that I consider the most pivotal scene of this part of the tale. With the two characters finally consummating their mutual attraction to each other we see the two as not separate entities but a singular one where both will reap whatever their search will sow in the end. Mi-do becomes less of a sidekick and more of an equal partner in Dae-su Oh's search. She knows that the only way she and Dae-su would find true happiness together is if she helps him finish his quest even if it means finding the truth that may not be to their liking.<br /><br />The third and final part of this tale finally puts to light just who exactly is the mastermind of all that has transpired. The clues picked up by Dae-su Oh starts to fall into place and the puzzle that opens up for him and the audience is nothing less than tragic and Shakespearean. This third part really hits the audience between the eyes about the nature of vengeance and how all-consumming it can be if allowed to simmer, grow and take root. We see how it has already driven Dae-su Oh to the brink of madness and how he teeters just beyond the point of no return. Then on the mastermind of the whole thing we see how oneslip of the tongue in the distant past of all involved has consumed this individual to exacting a complex and appropriate plan of revenge on Dae-su Oh. As the tragic and heartwrenching final part of the tale weaves and continues to the end no one ends up being the victor and all become just the victim of the cycle of violence and vengeance thats taken hold of everyone.<br /><br />Chan-wook Park's direction was flawless and there's not a wasted scene from beginning to end. Every scene was shot and edited with a sense of purpose to convey the mood and feel of the situation. It didn't matter whether it was a a slower-paced scene where the actors conversed in intelligent dialogue or a scene full of frantic energy where burst of violence seemed both randomly shot but choreographed at the same time. The composition of the scenes and his judicious use of wide-angle and static shots with little editing helps convey the the single-minded focus of Dae-su Oh and his main antagonist. Some of the scenes even show hints and clues to the audience that --- as unlikely as it might seem --- the whole film might be a figment of Dae-su Oh's fractured mind as a consequence of his imprisonment. Chan-wook Park doesn't answer whether it is a figment of Dae-su's imagination, but the theory is there for people to ponder.<br /><br />The screenplay as Park has written from the original Japanese manga is excellent and doesn't waste unnecessary exposition to distract the audience from the main tale being told. Everything said and acted on the screen ultimately leads to the shocking climax in the end. In fact, I would say that the climax of the film doesn't happen until the very last second of the film before everything fades to black and the credits roll. That's how tightly written and focused the screenplay was.<br /><br />Then there's the three main characters as played by Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, and Hye-jeong Kang. These three actors play their parts to perfection. Min-sik Choi as Dae-su Oh was a picture of focused madness. We invest in his quest for vengeance and as the final secret was unveiled we truly feel his shock, horror and anguish. Ji-tae Yu plays the mastermind of the whole thing with icy calculation. This was a man who had spent half his life working on, preparing and letting loose the events that would lead to him finally getting his revenge on Dae-su Oh. The two, though after the same goal of vengeance, are diametrically opposed in terms of look and personality. Then we have Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do, the young sushi chef caught in the middle of this duelling vengeance tale. She was both endearing, innocent and the pure soul that keeps Dae-su Oh from spiralling into final madness. It truly becomes tragic that the final consequences of the vengeance wrought by both male principals impacts the female in the middle and in the end she remains oblivious to the truth and Hye-jeong Kang conveys this sincere, innocent naivete to sweet perfection.<br /><br />There's much more to say about Oldboy, but its really just more accolades to be heaped upon a near-perfect film. A film exploring the darker side of man's inhumanity towards one another to satiate their self-righteous quest for so-called \\"justice\\" and retribution. Like Cronenberg's A History of Violence, Park's Oldboy also shows the unending cycle of vengeance heaped upon vengeance in addition to the violence it inherently breeds. Like Cronenberg's 2005 film, Oldboy doesn't fully answer this existential question but leaves it up to the viewer to make their own decision. Chan-wook Park's Oldboy is a film that comes but once in an era and helps redefine an era of its place in film history. Oldboy also continues the vengeance trilogy Park has confirmed will be finished with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (shortened to just Lady Vengeance here in North America). Oldboy makrs the true arrival of one of the new masters of film and he joins the fine company of such people as Spielberg, Coppola, Scorcese,Cronenberg, Bergman, Kubrick, Kurosawa and Lean. A near-perfect film all-around. 10/10hoi as Dae-su Oh was a picture of focused madness.

B0002OERI0|2.0|Green Day has always been somewhat of an oddity, not quite pop but not quite punk either. Earlier efforts such as Dookie and Insomnia showed promise for the rising tide of Pop-Punk bands in the late '90's.  Yet this album is a question mark to the genre.  Pop-Punk was meant to be fun catchy and stupid but intellectualizing and politizing the genre made it seem that it was in its dying days.  Somehow this album instead revitalized it Lables are signing Emo-Pop bands left and right indie has been compramised to an extent and Punk is all but dead. While i enjoy early Green Day I condem them for doing the unspeakable to indie and punk music C+
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson really nailed it with this big screen telling of the William Wallace legend. There are some liberties taken with historical facts, but overall the film presents all the heart, drama, and scale you'd want from a historical epic, and does it well with a three-hour running time that never feels padded or boring. The film also set a modern standard for melee brawls of combatants rushing head-on into each other, with lots of brutality, gore, and tight editing. It's the measuring stick by which all later films went up against, and the fight sequence everyone since has worked hard to outdo (see Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy).<br /><br />The dvd gives us the full three hours of the film without interruption like those old pesky VHS tapes. Picture and audio quality are good (considering the disc was released years ago), and we get two major supplements. A behind-the-scenes documentary provides some good tidbits and on-set footage, and the Mel Gibson commentary track is a laid back-yet-informative affair. There's not much in terms of quantity, but what we get covers the bases surprisingly well.<br /><br />A great movie for any collection.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris not only presents a message that needs to be read by everyone alive today, a call for reason and compassion in a world of faith based violence, but he presents it in finely tuned prose that is a joy to read.

The world hangs in the balance and is liable to end as we know it unless enough people live by the prescription provided by Sam Harris.
B00005JKCH|4.0|It's hard to dislike a movie that made comic book adaptations cool to the general public again. X-Men raised interest, but it was Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film that really showed people what could be done, both in terms of narrative and special effects. So while I don't dislike the movie, and recognize its importance in opening the floodgates for other superhero flicks, it's still not one that particularly sticks out for me.<br /><br />I feel Spider-Man is too workman-like. It excels at putting all the pieces together, but it lacks the stylistic touches that Burton brought to Batman, or that Donner did with the old Superman films. The film gets everything right, from the origin story to the crush on Mary Jane. Some liberities were taken with the Goblin and his costume, but I felt they were acceptable for translating the character and getting his part of the story rolling. And yes, the web-slinging sequences are amazing. But mostly, the film just lacked character for me. It impresses because they got it right, but thats only in comparison to the dozens of superhero adaptations where everything was totally wrong. Once I got past the faithfulness to the source material, Raimi didn't seem to put his personal stamp on the film.<br /><br />There was also way too much of the romantic triangle for me. I think the stuff they had here could've been played out over 2 or even 3 movies, and it comes off feeling very rushed. Considering they rehashed it for the sequel, they really should've slowed things down here.<br /><br />In all, Spider-Man is a good film. It lacks a certain distinctive quality for me and isn't my prefered superhero film to watch, but I'm glad I own a copy of it. The dvd offers decent picture and sound, and some okay extras. Commentary is boring, and the documentaries focus more on the spider-man mythology than the film's production. Worth grabbing now, or wait till movie 3 is released next year and the en evitable box set.

B0000028UK|5.0|I was never a real big fan of Pearl Jam due to the excessive radio and video play when they first made it big. I have since begun to appreciate them more, especially because their newest self-titled album is so good. It reverts back to the musical approach of their earlier albums. \\"Vs.\\" is a solid play throughout. Every song is good with only a few exceptions. As good as their previous album, \\"ten\\". Buy it if you like the newest album and want to explore their earlier work.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Though I'm usually not particularly fond of live-albums, this great album may very well be my favourite by Sarah McLachlan. It seems to me it has it all. Great vocals, a terrific band and some of McLachlan's very best songs; moreover the sound is as close to perfect you can expect from a live-album.<br /><br />The opening song \\"Building a Mystery\\" I first heard when someone played the \\"Lillith Fair\\" dvd for me. This was the song that opened my eyes and ears for McLachlan and her music.<br /><br />Among other outstanding songs \\"Hold on\\", \\"I Will Remember You\\", \\"Aidia\\" and the early song \\"Path of Thorns\\" deserve a mention. Great to hear the audience sing along on the live-favourite \\"Ice Cream\\"!
B00005JOQT|5.0|Going into this film I was really excited,and when I finally saw it I was just blown away.This is one of the greatest films of all time.Everything just came together perfectly.The film starts with Superman returning to Earth after a five year absence searching for the remains of his destroyed homeworld Krypton.He returns to find that the world has learned to exist without him.Not only has the world moved on so has the love of his life Lois Lane,who is now engaged to another man and has a son.Although this is a heavy emotional blow to the Man of Steel he has little time to recover,because his archenemy Lex Luthor has broken out of jail and has a new plan that threatens humanity. <br /> <br />  From start to finish the story is told perfectly with tons of laughs,emotion,and action;and director Bryan Singer brings this story to life.Apart from one of the most unique and original storylines ever the action is amazing as well,and this film's superb special effects help bring all of this epic action to life.The amazing score by John Ottman helps bring out all of the emotion and heart of this film making this one of the best movie scores ever.Lastly the acting is just picture perfect,especially Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor,and Brandon Routh IS this generation's Superman.All of the other parts are perfectly done as well.All of these factors combined help create one of the most immersive films ever. <br /> <br />  All in all this is an amazing film,it has tons of action and romance.Huge props to Bryan Singer and Co. for making one of the most amazing films ever.There are some scenes in this film that you will never forget(and that is meant in a good way). <br /> <br />Score:5 out of 5 stars!!!!!

B000002B49|5.0|Boheme by Deep Forest is an original work of art which integrates so many different musical ideas it should appeal to most listeners.  This is one CD where you may never get the itch to \\"fast forward\\" a particular song.  It flows so well I am always surprised each time it ends.  \\"Why do all the good ones seem so short?\\"  I'll say to myself.  I enjoy listening to other artists like Mythos, Enigma, and more recently Delirium or Magna Canta. All of these artists create wonder by blending modern day sound with traditional concepts and/or styles.  However, Boheme began to have a unique and \\"sacred\\" appeal to it so I regard this CD as very special.  I recommend Boheme to any who wish to be \\"enchanted\\" by the forces of ancestral yesteryear blended with the musical delights of today!!  I own two copies of Deep Forest's \\"Boheme\\" to make certain I will never be without this great music.

B00005JOX6|4.0|INTRO:OK ive seen great and bad rewiews about this movie.I saw it and it was pretty good and funny for the first part of the movie as Adam Sandler has some fun with a universal remote control then it gets dramatic and boring but it shouldnt thats what teared the movie down.You cant argue that this movie is a hit its especially because of Sandler who is well known to be funny,each of his movies are hits just because of him and its also the case of this movie.<br /><br />STORLINE:Who doesnt know it yet?A guy(Sandler)buys a universal remote control and plays it cool have fun until the remote fast forward his life and each time its to every 6 years from the time he is.He then realize that he missed his children grow up,his father`s death,his seperation from his wife and basicly his whole life!Thats when it gets boring  and stuff all dramatic and its not funny anymore.<br /><br />REWIEW:The first 45 minutes(aproximatly)are great and funny after that its dramatic i give a four star rating for the cool and funny moments.Its a movie thats -a must see- however.<br /><br />A summer hit despite the lame moments if you like Sandler see it for the good parts.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I was seven years old in 1978, when my father took me to see Richard Donner's fondly revered \\"Superman.\\" That film represented my first real exposure to that legendary DC Comics superhero. It, along with Richard Lester's equally memorable \\"Superman II,\\" has forever shaped my worldview of what Superman, the actual character, is all about.<br /><br />And then along came Bryan Singer, the one man brave enough to breathe new life into the Man of Steel after films III and IV very nearly destroyed his cinematic aura forever. A great many of us appear to harbor the impression that Mr. Singer had dropped the ball in a rather obtuse manner when he decided to helm this feature over \\"X-Men 3.\\"<br /><br />Clearly, I must digress.<br /><br />Having experienced \\"Superman Returns\\" once in the theater, I can now say in all honesty that I will never again listen to cynics or couch-critics. This was an affectionate and extremely well-crafted two and a half hour diversion from reality. We all seem to feel obligated to compare new films such as this to the older releases that inspired them. Why can't we just enjoy a film like this on its own merits? It isn't entirely outside the realm of reason, especially when you take into account that it's only a movie we're talking about in the first place. I saw quite a bit of the late Christopher Reeve within Brandon Routh's portrayal, and the casting of Kevin Spacey was nothing short of brilliant. His Lex Luthor, for me, was just as memorable as Gene Hackman's. I have to be honest and admit that watching this film was tantamount to reliving the one part of my childhood that I never really abandoned. That would more accurately entail my sense of enthrallment, the pure and innocent wonder I felt as a boy while watching Superman save the day.<br /><br />I really tend to believe that most of those people who, for whatever reason, did not enjoy this film are picking it apart for all the wrong reasons. Nothing Bryan Singer brings to this movie is anyless difficult to accept than the plot structure employed by Donner or Lester. \\"Superman Returns\\" is true to the spirit of the first two films and is a more than fitting addition to any fan's collection.<br /><br />Bravo, Bryan, bravo!!!
0143034901|5.0|I was reading this novel just as I was putting the finishing touches on my own first book; Senor Zafon's characterizations and scene descriptions encouraged and discouraged me at the same moment: encouraged because I was reminded that authors can put pictures into people's minds, pictures so vivid that the author's world becomes real; discouraged because he showed me what a long way to go I have as an author (and I wasn't even reading it in the native Spanish!).<br /><br />The places, like the library and the mansion, were visible to me.<br /><br />The main characters respect for his father, for the books, and his longing for the women in his life, was incredibly well described and laid out.<br /><br />And the plot yanks you in. I was reading this on a beautiful beach in Greece, and it continually brought me away from that reality into it's own world. I had to pass it to my wife and my son to read, and they also devoured it on the same vacation. It is that kind of read, the kind that you cannot put down no matter where you are.<br /><br />I eagerly search the Internet for news of Senor Zafon's next work.
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is a great swan song to one of the greatest musicans that ever lived.  You can tell that Johnny did not have much time left, but he put his whole heart and soul into each song that is on this album.  For those that are putting this album down, I just ask for all of you to just sit down and listen to this album just once.  If you don't have a tear come to your eye just once during any or all of these songs, you don't have a soul.  This will go down as an album that will stay in my collection for the rest of my life.  I fully recommend this to every Johnny Cash fan whether they be young or old.
0385474547|5.0|I read this book last year for highschool, and I loved it. Most people in my class hated it, or were to busy sleeping, or texting on their cell phones. <br /> <br />At first the book was a bit boring, about a guy who's father died and he neevr wanted to be like his dad, becuase his dad was weak, poor, and a beggar. <br /> <br />Chinua Achebe, did an amazing job with this book. He has little side storeis throughout the book. <br /> <br />For example: Why the turtles shell is cracked. He wanted to go to a feast up in the sky, so each of the birds around him gave him one feather, he flew into the sky and ate all of the good food at a feast. He renamed him self \\"ALl of you\\" so when he asked the cook who the food was for he said \\"All of you\\" The birds were so angry that they took each of their feathers back, and left him in the sky. He told one bird to tell the turtles wife to leave out all of the soft things in the house so that when he jumped out of the sky, he woud land safley. The bird tells the wife to put out all of the hard things, so when he jumps his shell cracks. <br /> <br />He does this throught the book. <br />He shows how the yam, represents power, and wealth. <br /> <br />He shows how much a society can change once religion is introduced.  <br /> <br />There are also many beating in this book, and a few killings.  <br /> <br />This is an amazing book, that everyone should read. <br /> <br />highly reccomended
B000006IUQ|3.0|This was a sit up and take notice kind of story and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout much of the picture.  Very good suspense.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I recently watched this film and it was a timely experience for me. We had just had the anniversary (1945 to 2005) of the end of World War II and I had visited several sites that had displays and memorabilia from that time period. <br /> <br />Pearl Harbor is a film worth seeing. I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck's, but I think this is his best role.  He's probably just being himself, which works in this film, where he plays a young and enthusiastic pilot.  The secondary lead is Josh Hartnett and he delivers an excellent performance as Affleck's best friend.  Kate Becksinsale is the girl that they both love and she is believable as a confident beauty and capable nurse.  <br /> <br />The film shows the build up and the attack on Pearl Harbor and is presented in a clear and concise fashion.  The horror of the attack is very realistic and I found it frightening to even experience it in a movie.   <br /> <br />Reading some of the other reviews, I was surprised at how many people disliked this movie. Watching a Hollywood made film and reading a history book are two entirely different things. Films are generally made to entertain and the historic details are often short changed in the endeavor to keep the attention of the audience. How many people actually pay $12 to go to the movie theater to see a documentary? <br />  <br /> <br />

B0009I7NNA|5.0|this album is so different from their last release waking the fallen. waking the fallen is an awesome metal album, and city of evil is showing that through their musical journey they appealed to the crowd with their metal, and now they are going deeper into music displaying great effort and a new interesting way of putting their music together. i wrote a review on american idiot by green day using constructive criticism against people that wanna hear another dookie and to just accept the fact that they are changing and that goes with avenged as well. what would be the point of releasing another waking the fallen?? this album shows growth and the fact that they are all around musicians not just people who can play good metal music. so many bands release album after album of the same sound with minor differences and a little bit more talent, but these guys are showing their diversity and talent and their epic side as well i.e. songs 7-10 on this album, all of them are progressive epic masterpieces in my opinion and these guys are all of 22-24 years old approximately. why are they being criticized for wanting to give the listener more? waking the fallen was a great way to catch the audiences attention, and now in my opinion they are maintaining our attention and then some! and i dont care that theyre on mtv either, this is one of the few bands that deserve their fame, if it were up to me, this band would be popular along with bands like dream theater because they take their music seriously, after all it is their career! so if u havent heard this album and u want my opinion, give it a chance and dont listen to all the immature people bashing this album because now theyre popular and theyre not playing straigt up heavy metal anymore, bands are gonna change, and in my opinion this band changed for the better.
B00000DHZJ|1.0|horrible cd - i feel like i am listening to samples of music on amazon or itunes - how could anyone think that they are listening to hendrix? i was suspicious when i looked at the back of the cd and saw the song lengths were so short but i got suckered in by the cheap price for so much music - in this case you get what you pay for -  i  would not recommend this cd to any hendrix lover - every song fades out - that is not the way the songs end - it as if there is no meaning or originality in the way a song ends - and that is not the way they are in the original recordings
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|there are a lot of metal and hardcore bands out there all basically doing the same thing. that is not the case for avenged sevenfold. this album was made by kids in which the oldest member was 21, and already they can play as fast and as clean as they do. the music is amazing, the lyrics are very well written and have a tremendous amount of meaning. on this album they tend to scream a little too much, but i cant complain because the singer is still amazing on this album and im more than thankful that its not just another band with constant screaming to the point where it gets on my nerves. the things that make this cd awesome (aside from the awesome musicianship all around) are riffs like the intro for \\"chapter four\\" and the breakdown in \\"second heartbeat\\" with the music playing behind the singer saying \\"as time passes by, regret for the rest of my life,\\" it sounds PERFECT. i can go on and on about the reasons why this album is awesome but your best bet is to just give it a listen because odds are not everyone is going to agree with me, so find a friend of yours that has it and listen to it, and i guarantee most of you will like it if you appreciate talent and you like progressive metal. avenged sevenfold is awesome!
B00005UDPD|5.0|Hyperbole rules in customer reviews, but I honestly believe that this is the greatest album ever released. It almost certainly influenced the history of rock and roll more than any other single album made, even more than SGT PEPPER. Why? The greatest influence on the Beatles after their initial fame was listening to Bob Dylan. The influence of the single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" alone was staggering. (It was released as a single months before the album.) Upon listening to Dylan and this album/song, Sam Cooke wrote a masterpiece in trying to imitate him (\\"A Change is Gonna Come\\"), as did Otis Redding (\\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\\"). Both Lennon and McCartney abandoned the pop love songs that had been the staple of the Beatles success through 1965 to write the more complex lyrics found on REVOLVER and RUBBER SOUL. Virtually every rock songwriter on both sides of the Atlantic had to rethink everything that they were doing with their music.  His previous albums had found a wide audience, but primarily in the folk scene.  This was true even of BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME.  Primarily because of the success of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" as a single, this was the first Dylan album that was primarily a rock album rather than folk.<br /><br />There are so many remarkable aspects to this album. The lyrics are so incredible as to seem beyond the capacity of someone as young and uneducated as Dylan, full of deep cultural resonances and references while maintaining a poetic perfection. Every fan can name his or her own favorites: mine are \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" the title song, \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\\" and \\"Desolation Row.\\"  The success of the album made his earlier albums equally essential for rock performers, instantly providing rock with a verbal palette that dramatically extended the simple love song to almost any subject.<br /><br />One thing that sets this album from so many Dylan albums that followed is the excellence of the session musicians.  As great as Dylan is, on many of his albums he employs musicians that simply aren't among the best.  Take the guitar work alone.  Although Robbie Robertson would provide superb work on BLONDE ON BLONDE, no Dylan album after HIGHWAY 61 would feature such stellar solo work as what Michael Bloomfield would provide on this one.  The filler lines he provides at the end of the various lines in \\"Tombstone Blues\\" is just one example.  But as fine as Bloomfield is, he is matched by the astonishing playing by country guitarist Charlie McCoy on \\"Desolation Row,\\" who achieves the near impossible by playing eleven minutes of acoustic guitar in counterpoint to Dylan's strumming, and manages to make it compelling throughout.<br /><br />Above all else, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED created the potential for rock to be difficult and challenging.  Before Dylan, no one listening to rock had to use more than just a tiny fraction of their brain.  After this album, rock became intelligent, or at least had that potential.  Take \\"Desolation Row.\\"  Apart from Chuck Berry telling Beethoven to roll over, rock contained in its first decade virtually no cultural references to speak of.  But in that song alone Dylan sings of Cinderella, Bette Davis, Romeo, Cain and Abel, the hunchback of Notre Dame, the Good Samaritan, Ophelia, Noah, Einstein, the Phantom of the Opera, Casanova, Nero, Neptune, the Titanic, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot.  Rock had never been so literate before and has only rarely been this intelligent since.  Somehow in an eleven-minute song Dylan managed to sum up huge hunks of modern culture.  In conjunction with the other songs on the album, in particular \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" and \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" Dylan seemed to sum up all the alienation that the youth of the sixties was feeling in regard to the consumerism that had exploded in the fifties.<br /><br />It is hardly conceivable that any serious fan of music in general or rock in particular isn't already familiar with every second ofthis album, but if not, you must get it. On its own merits, it is one of the supreme cultural achievements of the century, and its massive influence on every single songwriter who grew up in its wake only makes knowing it all that more essential.y second of this album, but if not, you must get it.

Upon listening to Dylan and this album/song, Sam Cooke wrote a masterpiece in trying to imitate him (\\"A Change is Gonna Come\\"), as did Otis Redding (\\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\\"). Both Lennon and McCartney abandoned the pop love songs that had been the staple of the Beatles success through 1965 to write the more complex lyrics found on REVOLVER and RUBBER SOUL. Virtually every rock songwriter on both sides of the Atlantic had to rethink everything that they were doing with their music.  His previous albums had found a wide audience, but primarily in the folk scene.  This was true even of BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME.  Primarily because of the success of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" as a single, this was the first Dylan album that was primarily a rock album rather than folk.<br /><br />There are so many remarkable aspects to this album. The lyrics are so incredible as to seem beyond the capacity of someone as young and uneducated as Dylan, full of deep cultural resonances and references while maintaining a poetic perfection. Every fan can name his or her own favorites: mine are \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" the title song, \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\\" and \\"Desolation Row.\\"  The success of the album made his earlier albums equally essential for rock performers, instantly providing rock with a verbal palette that dramatically extended the simple love song to almost any subject.<br /><br />One thing that sets this album from so many Dylan albums that followed is the excellence of the session musicians.  As great as Dylan is, on many of his albums he employs musicians that simply aren't among the best.  Take the guitar work alone.  Although Robbie Robertson would provide superb work on BLONDE ON BLONDE, no Dylan album after HIGHWAY 61 would feature such stellar solo work as what Michael Bloomfield would provide on this one.  The filler lines he provides at the end of the various lines in \\"Tombstone Blues\\" is just one example.  But as fine as Bloomfield is, he is matched by the astonishing playing by country guitarist Charlie McCoy on \\"Desolation Row,\\" who achieves the near impossible by playing eleven minutes of acoustic guitar in counterpoint to Dylan's strumming, and manages to make it compelling throughout.<br /><br />Above all else, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED created the potential for rock to be difficult and challenging.  Before Dylan, no one listening to rock had to use more than just a tiny fraction of their brain.  After this album, rock became intelligent, or at least had that potential.  Take \\"Desolation Row.\\"  Apart from Chuck Berry telling Beethoven to roll over, rock contained in its first decade virtually no cultural references to speak of.  But in that song alone Dylan sings of Cinderella, Bette Davis, Romeo, Cain and Abel, the hunchback of Notre Dame, the Good Samaritan, Ophelia, Noah, Einstein, the Phantom of the Opera, Casanova, Nero, Neptune, the Titanic, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot.  Rock had never been so literate before and has only rarely been this intelligent since.  Somehow in an eleven-minute song Dylan managed to sum up huge hunks of modern culture.

B0009ML238|5.0|WOW! Thats all I can say. I had never heard anything from Circus Maximus before, nothing. Decided to pick up this album after hearing there names come up a lot on the PAGAN'S MIND forums. I popped this disc in, and immediatly the galloping, deep, death metalish sound of Sin kicked me in the chest. I was thinking... \\"This isn't prog this is Death Metal!\\" then, the keyboards and odd time signatures kicked in. I knew the music was awesome, but I was just waiting for the vocals. Prog vocals ethier make or break a band, and then a new age Geddy Lee style sound came thrashing in. I knew from this moment this band was AWESOME! A great mix of Dream Theater, Symphony X, Pagan's Mind, and Queensryche this band is amazing.

B000FGGE68|4.0|Granted , except for the graphics during the motorcycle scenes, this movie was awesome.Nonstop action all the way.It had more killing in it than Arnold's Commando.And it had a great story behind all the action.You should definetly pick this movie up!
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is a truly great album. In 100 years time there will still not be anyone that expresses humankind's shortcomings, regrets, sadness and happiness the same way as the late great Johnny Cash did in song. The voice is fighting to breath at times in songs like \\"if you could read my mind\\" but never once loses any of the power and emotion that we have come to love from the great man. Thank you Johnny and Rick Rubin for bringing out such powerful and brilliant music, anyone who appreciates music that comes from the soul should buy this album.

1558908382|5.0|Grosse Pointe Blank is a fabulous dark comedy in the vein of Pulp Fiction, where violence and humor mix wonderfully. The movie stars John Cusack (Say Anything), Minnie Driver (Good Will Hunting), Alan Arkin (Glengarry Glen Ross), Joan Cusack (The School Of Rock), Jeremy Piven (Scary Movie 3), and Dan Aykroyd (Trading Places).    Cusack plays Martin Blank, a ruthless hitman who meets with a psychiatrist, played by Arkin, who wants nothing to do with him, lives on the west coast, and recieves an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe where he'll have to make amends with Debi, played by Driver, the girl he stood up 10 years ago, escape a goon who's trying to kill him and Grocer, played by Aykroyd, a rival hitman who is forcing him to join a hitman union. Once in Grosse Pointe, Blank is up for one surprise after another including a change of heart, and lifestyle, for the girl that he loves, and his final mark who happens to be her father.    Grosse Pointe Blank is one of my all time favorite comedies. The script is slick and funny, and Cusack simply lights up the screen in his most dynamic performance to date. In addition to that, the fight scene in the school hallway is classic!    Recommended    A
B000068PQ0|5.0|No that's not it. This damn album is that beautiful. The Soft Bulletin is even more so.  But my first experience with The Flaming Lips was from a skateboarding DVD (Hot Chocolate Tour Documentary). While listening I thought wow this stuff is different and what a lyrical concept (Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots). I know myself that good-when I listen to mearly a sound sample on Amazon and the music of that 30 second sample moves me so much that I waste no time on clicking the purchase button. Thats when I know I've made a great and wise purchse as well as knowing I've fallen in love with a new album.
1577312082|5.0|I have read this book 3 times and find new depths of wisdom each time I read it. I am not going to elaborate further on the book since many others have done so already. What I would like to do here is respond to the negative reviews that this book has received: most all have a couple of commons themes.  <br /> <br />Many of the neg reviewers seem to want some new or overly complicated path to peace and enlightenment. Why should the path be \\"newly discovered\\" or complicated? It doesn't make sense. The fact is that the way has been with us for thousands of years. Why? Because it is so simple. In fact, it is so simple and so obvious that is often forgotten or overlooked. I'll give you an analogy. What if someone told you to keep a grain of sand for them. You would think, \\"A grain of sand? Anyone could do that.\\" But being so simple and small only makes the sand more difficult to manage. Such is the truth of Tolle's message. It is so simple and obvious that it is often overlooked and forgotten. Like the vase that has been sitting on the mantle for 7 years that you don't even realize is there anymore. That too is the reason for so much repitition-to drive in the basic concepts which are easily forgotten. And that is why I have to reread the book from time to time. <br /> <br />I hope this helps. <br />
B0002W18MU|5.0|In this album we see in the final days and hours of his recording life, the songs and thoughts that were \\"Johhny Cash\\".  It is as if he wrote this for his family of fans to understand his heart and mind.  It is a message that he wants all to know, not only about his life but about his God. It is a message of hope. Mostly he speaks as a man facing his own death. In other songs he speaks like a prophet.  He is a man the world misses not only those of his age but those on myspace as well.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|It took four episodes to come close to what Larry McMurtry accomplished in his book but this movie does it. It's only flaws are in the occasional cheesy special effects (sandstorm) that more that fifteen years ago were inevitable on a TV budget.<br /><br />Perfect casting, even to the most minor roles, a beautiful score by Basil Poulidaris, and Bill Witliff's amazingly taut script (yes, taut, even at this length) make this, along with Ken Burns' 'Civil War' documentary, the best made-for-TV productions I have ever seen. It is little wonder that Robert Duvall still claims that Augustus McCrae is the greatest role he has ever played, equating the part's depth and richness to that of Hamlet.<br /><br />The scope of this story, which in some ways dwarfs the small screen and cries out for something larger, makes up in depth for what it lacks in breadth. The only thing more grand than the majesty of the West is the ability of the human heart to expand to fill it. Gus McCrae, Woodrow Call, Clara Allen, July Johnson and 'Deets' are all so real to me that their history disappears seamlessly into the history of this nation. 'Lonesome Dove' is America's version of 'Les Miserables' with the human heart the ultimate victor in life's tragedy.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Have no fear,it's finally here! No,not Underdog The Movie,but the LONG awaited return of the Man of Steel,Superman! <br /> <br />Bryan Singer has created in Superman Returns a masterpiece that <br />fans and moviegoers won't forget anytime soon.Taking place after <br />Superman II,Superman Returns gets the series back on track and makes us remember why we love the Man of Steel in the first place.Here is my review of this wonderful film. <br /> <br />(includes minor spoilers) <br /> <br />Scientists have found the remains of the remains of Krypton,so <br />Kal-El,aka Clark Kent/Superman(Brandon Routh),makes a journey to <br />the remnats in the Kryptonian spaceship he arrived in from the  <br />first film.He is disappointed that what he finds nothing of any  <br />vital significance and flies back to Earth.When he returns,the <br />world has changed:five years have passed and the world has learned to move on without Superman.The girl he loves,Lois Lane(Kate Bosworth),is now a mother,is engaged to be married to the  <br />editor of the Daily Planet's nephew(James Marsden,\\"The X-Men Trilogy),and has written a award-winning article called \\"Why the <br />world doesn't need Superman.\\"After visiting his mother(Eva Marie Saint in a wonderful performance),Clark returns to Metropolis in order to get his job back at the Daily Planet.Nobody knew he was gone,except Jimmy Olsen(Sam Huntington,who gives the film's best performance),who is overjoyed to see his friend return.While the two are taking a lunch break,Lois is on a plane where she is taking part in a  <br />space shuttle launch when all the technology fails.Clark watches <br />this on the television and knows it's time to return as Superman.After stopping the plane(the film's most amazing scene),Lois is reunited with the man she loves and is reunion of mixed emotions.Meanwhile,the technology has failed because of a certain bald villian.That's right,Lex Luthor(Kevin Spacey)has been released from prison and is launching another scheme as <br />only Lex can.Now,Superman,who is slowly winning back the respect of the people of the world,including Lois,must stop Lex before Lex achieves world domination. <br /> <br /> <br />To sum it up,this is the most fun,you will have at the movies this year! <br /> <br />The acting is wonderful.Kevin Spacey chews up the screen as Lex Luthor.He is like Gene Hackman in the sense that he is funny,but he is also very driven in this movie to destroy Superman and to fulfill his plan of world domination.Parker Posey is Kitty,his female accomplice and she has several good moments in the film.James Marsden is also very good as Lois finace,Richard.Eva Marie Saint is not in the film very much,neither is Frank Langella as Perry White,but are both very good.No need to worry about Sam Huntington as Jimmy;he is the best actor in the movie. <br /> <br />And now the two leads:Kate Bosworth is a very good Lois.Not only is she really attractive(sorry,had to put that down),but also acts like Lois would today.She is very good in this role and I hope she continues the role in the next couple of movies.And finally,Brandon Routh.Brandon Routh is a very good Superman and I think he is an absolutley wonderful Clark Kent.He picks the mannerisms of Christopher Reeve(Rest in Peace),but he adds something to the roles,especially as Superman.He WILL win over fans and I hope to see him in this film's sequel. <br /> <br />Other positive aspects of the film are the action pieces,the visual effects,and the score.The action is the best there has ever been in a Superman film.Superman stopping the plane,saving the city,and all the other action scenes are wonderful as well.The visual effects are great.Superman finally flies the way he always should have.You will be very impressed as he see not only Superman using his flying abilities,but also his heat vision,super breath,and his many other abilites as well.The score is great as well.Wisely using the classic John Williams score,the film alsouses new music from John Ottman(X2:X-Men United)and it goes very well with the original score.Two thumbs up with the above mentioned. <br /> <br />As good as the film was,it's not perfect.It does have faults,but they are minor.The first problem was at first some of the scenes felt out of order near the beginning of the movie.However,it was important to the plot and once I thought about it,the movie began to flow much better.Second,Brandon Routh,Kate Bosworth,and Kevin Spacey are great,but Christopher,Margot Kidder,and Gene Hackman are the ones I grew up with,so it felt weird seeing these great actors in these roles.But they are so great that they eventually win you over with their performances.And third and finally,the movie is similar to the first film,but to me,this is a much better movie than the first because the characters are better and the plots  for Lex's plan and the Superman/Lois Lane scenes are far better here as well. <br /> <br />So overall,Bryan Singer has created another comic book movie masterpiece that will join with Batman Begins,the Spider-Man Movies,the X-men Movies,the first two Supermans,the Blade movies,Batman:Mask of the Phantasm,and the Crow as one of the best comic book movies ever made.Bryan Singer truly made a film for the fans and you can tell he is a fan himself just from watching the opening credits. <br /> <br />You will love this film.I am a even bigger Superman fan now after seeing this film and hopefully everyone else who sees the film will feel the same way.Superman is back! Enjoy the ride!

B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill vol. 2 was a magical movie which transports its viewer to another world of cold blood revenge mixed with lots of heart. The truth is Kill Bill vol. 2 is not as much of an eastern influenced movie as the first. Where vol. 1 was a revenge tale that consisted entirely of fake blood, back flips, and samurai swords, vol. 2 focuses on the heart and souls of the characters. Uma Thurman is back as the bride, and while she is still out on her path of revenge for the killing of her fianc&eacute;, the story takes a detour right in the middle that shows her origins. The Pei Mei sequence is humorous, and sets the stage for future events. At one point, Thurman is berried alive by one of the people that were on her death list. The scene is mildly frightening but in all reality nothing is actually shown. The entire scene shows nothing but the pitch black darkness of her underground tomb. If the audience is not fully engrossed in what they are watching, they might be a tab bit bored during this duration of the movie which lasts about 13 minutes. Like vol. 1, this film is broken in to chapters, starting with chapter 6. Although this movie is director by the infamous Quentin Tarantino, the film is not nearly as violent as was the first. One of the only violent parts is when Elle Driver, (Daryl Hannah), and the bride fight the brutal battle of the blondes. The scene ends with an eye pulled out of its socket. This is not a pretty sight as you can imagine. Hard core fans might not approve of the lack of action and overload of story, but since the story has such a level of coherence, it works. This film is a superb look in to a killers mind and the emotions they go through, and although the sword may have dulled the second time a around, audiences should stick around to see Uma Kill Bill.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am not a big fan of these type of movies.  They are usually boring but well acted.  I liked this one alot.  It has alot of drama but still keeps a light tone about it.  Kiera Knightley does a great job in this film, (much better in my opinion than Reese Witherspoon did in Walk the Line).  It is sometimes hard to understand what they are saying because they speak so fast.  Although this movieis much shorter than the BBC 9 hour version it still packs a punch.  I would see it if i were you.
B000E41MS6|3.0|I was looking forward for months to going out and buying this collection today -- until I saw the price. $70 for 13 one hour episodes? And MSRP is $99??

B000B5Y00U|4.0|For the long time that this performance was out of print, it became legendary. Caballe in her prime in 1968 sang more easily than de los Angeles, more beautifully than Sills, with more technical security than Callas. She was paired with the elegantly stylish Carlo Bergonzi, always a critics' favorite. The only fly in the ointment was said to be the wayward, push-pull conducting of Georges Pretre--but how bad could that be?<br /><br />Astonishingly bad, actually. Pretre takes it upon himself to distort every single number in the opera, adding arbitrary taffy pulls to the tempo, stopping the music in mid-phrase, and generally throwing the listener off balance. As a result, his lead singers are timid about cutting loose, and despite their vocal beauty, both Bergonzi and Caballe sound trapped in Pretre's grip. Of course, there's lots to love anyway. In terms of temperament, both leads are cooler than what we usually hear--these two aren't wildly passionate about each other. But they are warm, and abovee all the sounds they make are gorgeous.<br /><br />If you listen to key arias (Sempre libera, De' miei bollenti spiriti) you'll know immeidately if this calmer view of Violetta's tragedy is dramatically to your liking. Callas on the one hand and Pavarotti on the other make more vivid impressions. Sherrill Milnes records his first Germont here, his second being on the great Carlos Kleiber set (DG). He has a magnificent voice but also a tendency to shout, particularly as a younger singer--the Gramophone reviewer said that Milnes seems to be addressing a public assembly--but the voice per se is mesmerizing.<br /><br />In sum, a great Violetta in her prime is set in a production where things aren't perfect. But a lot is very fine.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've followed Tool for a long time and this album is evidence that they keep getting better with age.  For some reason, each time they release something I'm in the mood for it.  Each album is 'timely'.  This is no exception.  Just different enough from the last for me to be totally into it.  I can literally listen to Vicarious, Jambi and The Pot ten times in a row.  This is really an amazing band.  I guess being 30 now, I appreciate them more now then I did when I was 17.  It's been a great ride and I hope it continues.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen. Christian Bale is what gave this movie it's essence. What a excellent and hot actor this guy is! The whole script was excellent. There was nothing wrong with it, everything done perfect. Only if the other batmans were as good as this one.<br /><br />Katie Holmes did not perform a good acting job in this. She was a bad choice for this movie. She showed no chemistry towards Bale, but Bale did showed chemistry towards her.<br /><br />I cant wait for sequels to this one.
B000FVRS8Q|5.0|The performance, production, and overall quality of this disc makes it one of the best live albums I've heard/bought in many years.  I'd be extremely proud to leave Nightwish on this release if I were Tarja.  It's a great release, and highly recommended!
B0009A40ES|2.0|This movie was such a disapointment. I thought it was going to be so voilent but it wasent. Only 2 murder scenes. There was more sex scences than murder scenes. The murder scenes didnt even show anything. In a later scene they show dead bodies all over the house but it never showed him killing them.<br /><br />Christian Bale is naked alot in this movie. Which was the only reason to watch this movie. His acting as a psycho was scary though. The ending made no sense. It was like he fantasized the whole thing. Confusing. Horrible movie, big let down.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|One of the best cd to come out this year.  Very solid the whole way through and this cd shows that they are maturing in there music.  Well worth the money
0307276902|3.0|Never mind the hype about whether certain passages of this book really happened.  Never mind that the author committed a cardinal sin by ticking off Oprah Winfrey.  This book is not worth reading simply because it's badly written.  It's full of random thoughts, non sequiters and incoherent ramblings.  It wallows in a place that I simply didn't want to go.  If it speaks to you as a reader, that's terrific.  But it just left me out in the cold.
B00009V7T2|5.0|My son, who just graduated from college, gave me this CD. He has often heard me complain that nothing new and exciting is happening in music today, so he introduced me to Mars Volta. I'm very sure I would be correct in saying that Mars Volta is like no other band in music today. As you read the other reviews, you hear the descriptor \\"progressive\\"- I agree to the nth degree. You also read about comparisions to Led Zep...  I don't clearly see this, unless the reviewer is referring to Volta's total disregard of the standard 4/4 beat. The problem with this comparision is that Volta's music is far more complex then Led Zeppelin. I would argue that Mars Volta is much more closely related to the more complex works of YES or KING CRIMSON. My initial reaction was that Mars Volta does not have the individual virtuosity of Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman, or Robert Fripp. But the more I listen, the more I realize that Mars Volta is made up of truly geat musicians. It is all held together by a \\"lead drummer\\" that can change time and rhythm in a split second. He may do this ten times in a single song. I am now beginning to appreciate the brilliance of the guitar work by group founder Omar Rodriguez-Lopez. This is a special group, one that doesn't come around very often. Thank you Mars Volta for extending the progressive rock of some outstanding groups from the 1970's. The music is still the foundation.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is a great show and I am so excited that it is coming out with another season. This show is interesting and innovative every week and there is never a dull moment. Jensen and Jared really seem like brothers due to their undeniable chemistry together. This show has the right formula to keep people of all ages entertained every week. I can't wait until this season 1 dvd comes out...in fact i wish it were coming out sooner. Definetly the best show on television. I have loved it since the first episode aired.
0553579908|4.0|These books really are a cut above the usual, and I'm glad I read them, but I won't be going on to book 3. I appreciate the realism and it makes a refreshing change, but there is a bit too much sadistic torture/horror for me to stomach. To give Martin his due, he is the only fantasy author I know who tells the truth: shallow people prattle about how suffering ennobles the soul, but in fact cruelty disfigures the soul, as much as it does the body. People who are brutalized often become brutes. But I just don't want to watch as Arya becomes more and more twisted and vengeful.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Every great musician's story is the same: they come from nowhere, rise to the top, begin using drugs and alcohol to relieve the pressure; they fall, only to rise again through one revelation or another. Either that or they die young; in which case, they become immortalized icons despite the manner in which they died (many like to forget that Jimi Hendrix choked to death on his own vomit). Oh, and let's not forget the love story. That's the best part. <br /> <br /> The life of Johnny Cash (Phoenix) was no different. James Mangold's Walk the Line is a look at the early years of Cash's career and his battle with drug addiction, fame, and his past. The film opens as most biopics do, with a glimpse into the subject's childhood with emphasis on one event. Filmmakers like to use this single traumatic event to attempt an investigation into the subject's psyche, though it's usually more complicated than that. The event in this film is the death of Cash's brother, which happens to be the same as what we saw in last year's Ray, the film biography of Ray Charles. The similarities between the two films do not end there. <br /> <br /> We fast forward to Cash's service in the Air Force, where he first began to write songs. By the time he started recording at Sun Studios in Memphis in 1955, he was married to Vivian Cash (Goodwin) and had two children. He and other greats like Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Roy Orbison (Jonathan Rice) went on tour and began to reinvent popular music by giving birth to Rock and Roll. It was on this tour, too, that he met June Carter (Witherspoon), a long-time interest of his ever since he began listening to her family sing on the radio as a child.  <br /> <br /> The film shifts its focus to these two. The relationship between June Carter and Johnny Cash was certainly complicated yet it was beautifully unique. For much of the film Cash chases Carter around without success until she literally saves his life, and convinces him to stop using drugs. It is the story of these two individuals that gives the movie the heart and honesty that it holds throughout.  <br /> <br /> Walk the Line never glorifies Cash in a way that makes him invincible. Phoenix is quite good at reminding us that he was human, and his darker side often had control. But his affection for Carter was strong enough to save him and inspiration enough to keep him going. <br /> <br /> A common worry about the film, especially for Cash fans, is that this is just another large production to cash in on the new market of musical biopics in which Ray was so successful. Are Mangold and Phoenix just looking Oscars? That doesn't seem to be the case. Mangold understands and appreciates his subject and he's done his research. Phoenix and Witherspoon have put so much time and effort into taking voice lessons to make the film as authentic as possible. The people involved in the making of this film are well aware of the musical giant Cash was and love that Carter and Cash shared. <br /> <br />        As for the parallels this draws to Ray and the tales of other musicians, that is part coincidence and partly intended. There are many scenes that are over dramatized and some even fabricated. These are mostly small details, though, and the film remains credible and unhindered.  <br />  <br /> Johnny Cash was a pioneer of Rock n' Roll music and his influence and appeal spans all genres and generations. The Man In Black was the father of Country music and a predecessor of Rock. His story may be one we've heard before, but it's one we want to hear again anyway.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|It is unfortunate that most folks that i've spoken with have likened this album as being \\"neo-soul\\". Let me just say that there is no such thing as Neo-soul. Neo-Soul does not exist except in agendas of music executives who aim keep certain forms of black music in a box where it's conditioned to be unmarketable.  <br /> <br />Plus, i have also heard folks make careless comparisons to Corinne with the likes of Erykah Badu or Norah Jones. This madness needs to stop. Corinne is her own artist within her own sound. And folks need to stop blind comparisons such as these, and allow fantastic artists like Corinne to grow wiithin thier own skin.  <br /> <br />With that said... Corinne is truly a breath of fresh air in an atmosphere of payola and executive controlled music. There is not one song on this album that misses the mark. Corinne sings like a hopeful songbird looking to either keep a love strong or renew it. Every song had me silently saying to myself and to her, \\"i can give her that, and so much more\\". As a man, Corinne makes me want to empathize and give her the kind of love and attention she is searching for. Nowadays, within an atmosphere of bodies being showcased as a tool for sex and one night stands, not many female artists can do what Corinne has accomplished in one solitary album. Songs such as 'Call Me When You Get This', 'Breathless' and 'Enchantment', makes a man want a woman for more than what she has to offer on the outside.  <br /> <br />My only concern with Corinne is she tends to mumble some of the words in her songs. I had to repeat a verse or two more than twice to understand what she's saying. Nevertheless, once I was clear on her message, she had me hook, line and sinker.  <br /> <br />This is a very sweet and introspective album that can surely open your heart and minds to something new. It is a fantastic companion for taking a summer drive with your significant other.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend it.
B00005JO20|4.0|What is it about a remake that creates such skepticism within everyone? Perhaps the most common argument heard every time a film is re-made: \\"Why redo something that was perfect the first time?\\" It's a question often posed when a new band covers a classic song. The only real answer to the question is one that certainly applies to Peter Jackson's King Kong. It's a way to honor a classic film and introduce it to a whole new generation.            Outlining the well-known plot of King Kong may be a futile practice, but please indulge me. Hoping for a great film and willing to do anything to make it, filmmaker Carl Denham (Black) sets sail on a small ship to Skull Island with his newly recruited actress, Ann Darrow (Watts). On the ship, Ann falls for the scriptwriter and author, Jack Driscoll (Brody). After reaching the Island, Denham finds it more dangerous than he had expected and has his actress kidnapped by the native people for sacrifice to Kong. While searching for Ann and after losing his film (along with a few of his shipmates) Denham decides he can still profit from this expedition by capturing Kong and bringing him back to New York.     The first hour of the film is slow to say the least. Black's performance is drenched in melodrama in a successful attempt to reflect the 1933 film. But the hour of this in New York runs much longer than it should. When the film finally makes it on to the ship, it drags again to allow for the relationship between Darrow and Driscoll to form and grow. By the time we first see Kong, we felt like we've already watched an entire film and when considering the time that has elapsed that's not too difficult to imagine.      As far as acting goes, this film was not challenging for the actors, but the performance was demanding. It's hard to imagine the giant inhabitants of Skull Island not being there as you see the reactions on the faces of the actors. It's easy to forget that these monsters are added in later by a computer. Thatis accredited to performance. I doubt that Naomi Watts ever thought she'd have to juggle in front of a giant ape or that Adrien Brody knew he would have to fight a monkey for the love of a woman. The interactions between the ape and the humans must be appreciated.      Not surprisingly, the most interesting character to watch is Kong himself. His countenance alone runs parallel to the genres illustrated by the film. The anger of his face emphasizes the passion present in the fight scenes and supports the action significantly. The soft, human expression he displays when looking upon Darrow underlines the admiration he feels and the love story, which may be the strongest theme of the film. Our view of Kong changes throughout the film, and it's a skillful device on Jackson's part.      Though the love story is strong, the action does not suffer. Don't be fooled, this film is a lot of fun to watch. It's easy to get taken in by the scene where Kong battles three Tyrannosaurus Rexes. Jackson has invested a lot of time in making sure every aspect of the film is just right, and he did not hold back on the action.            As for the criticism this and other remakes have endured, I fail to see the harm in it. Peter Jackson was a fan of the original King Kong ever since he first saw it as a child. His film pays homage to the classic and that's apparent through small elements, not to mention the fact that he chose to set the film in the same time period as the original instead of making a modern update, as the worst of remakes choose to do.      I noticed that many DVD stores started repackaging the original and putting it on display cases, as is the common routine when a remake comes out. After this new King Kong perhaps some people will check out the original, which is the greatest purpose for any remake. Not all of us were around in 1933 to see the mighty Kong on the screen for the first time, and we need a reminder of what made it so magical in the first place. The question here should not be \\"why remake King Kong?\\" Rather we should wonder if, after Lord of the Rings and the running time of King Kong at 187 minutes, is Peter Jackson capable of making a movie less than three hours long?
0689862725|5.0|I use this book in my classroom, as part of a Red Riding Hood unit.  In this unit, we explore modern versions of the classic fairy tale.  The students love the graphics, and I love that I can supplement curriculum with Stephen King in under a week.  This book triggers more kids going to the public library to find more King novels than anything I could have imagined!  This adaptation holds intact the necessary elements of the original novel.  I use this book, and this unit, to teach about Id,Ego and Superego.  We also explore the use of symbolism with Red and the woods. The students examine the ways stories are used to morally instruct the young, and are able to see red riding hood develop from a damsel in distress to a hero in her own right.  This unit helps 12 and 13 year olds see the ways that myth and fairy tale change over time, yet are still critical to literature centuries later.  I use this book in conjunction with the film \\"The Village\\", and the original Grimm's Fairy Tale.
B00005JOQS|3.0|I really liked the earlier Superman movies. Routh does a fair job of channelling Christopher Reeve, at least visually. And I'll suspend disbelief long enough for three impossible things, just to get the movie going.<br /><br />My suspended disbelief collapsed under the weight that this movie loaded onto it, though. Like how Lex Luthor \\"just knew\\" that the seed crystal would incorporate other material into whatever grew from it - but not the skin cells left from handling it or the bugs in the water around it. Like why Lois Lane kept dragging her son into insanely dangerous situations.<br /><br />And why we're supposed to cheer for a guy who uses his super-powers to peek into bedroom windows of a former girlfriend and sneak in on her sleeping child. That left me feeling as if I had come into way too much contact with something that I really need to wash off. Yeah, it was all innocent, but ... {shudder}.<br /><br />This movie presents all the super-stuff in pretty much the ways you'd expect to see it, along with Bryan Singer's fascination with things jittering off desks and tables (how many times was that used? four? more?). Between the strange character studies and the unending stream of \\"where did that come from?\\" events, I really came away wishing I had spent my money on a different movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002J09|5.0|This is definatly my second favorite Led Zeppelin album, first being \\"The Houses of the Holy\\". My favorites from this \\"Zoso\\" are: Black Dog, Rock and Roll, The Battle of Evermore, Stairway to Heaven, Going to California, and When the Levee Breaks. This is a masterpiece of an album, and Stairway to Heaven is the crowning jewel of this album. People who say it or Led Zeppelin are overrated are the biggest idiots. Black Dog is a combination of capting lyrics and interesting bluesy rock guitar. Rock and Roll is an instant classic. Battle of Evermore moves along well, with very nice lyrics by Robert Plant. Stairway is a beautiful piece. Going to California is a great ridin' in the car tune, as it has a good feel, and When the Levee Breaks is just a good song. If you're starting into Led Zeppelin, I suggest Zoso, The Houses of the Holy, and one of the other first 3 Zeppelin albums. LED ZEPPELIN RULES!
B000002B2T|4.0|I actually purchased the VHS version of this masterpiece when it first came out and if my memory serves me correctly it was taped at the fillmore in san francisco. Eventually, I purchased the CD. <br />This is a great CD to buy. I strongly urge anyone who reads this to buy this one, trust me. This came out back when mainstream music was still a thing of artistic expression. Now the music scene is dominated primarily by booty-shakin B.S and a bunch of disposable pop bubble gum crap. Buy this cd and also buy the DVD/VHS version and you'll be all the better for it. There is a great clip of Layne(alice in chains) singing \\"lifeless dead\\" on it and mike(pearl Jam) laying down a great guitar lick. Great stuff!!! <br /> <br />-we miss you layne-        Thanks for the memories pal... <br /> <br />-Joey
B00005QEO2|5.0|This is a great collection from an incredible band. Though not the best, as it doesn't have some of it's hit songs in their hit forms, like live or acoustic, it's still one of the better collections. Though I noticed it has almost the same song list as the later album, \\" Aerosmith Gold\\". Of the two, I suggest this one. Plus, just look at the cover of \\"Young Lust\\"! Anyways, this or \\"Gold\\" along with \\"Aerosmith\\" and \\"Toys in The Attic\\" would be a good buy. This along with \\"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits\\" would be a bad buy because on the greatest hits, the songs, like \\"Sweet Emotion\\", are edited WAY to much. I have the unfortunate fortune to have \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits\\". The live \\"Dream On\\" on this and \\"Gold\\" from \\"A Little South of Sanity\\" is very well done for a live, though it's still better to have the original studios as well. This is a very good buy, better than \\"Gold\\". AEROSMITH ROCKS!
B000J103PC|3.0|Meryl Streep is probably the best character actress of her generation. Playing the devilish Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway, she embodies all that one imagines of a self-centered, sarcastic, materialistic, power-hungry boss, whose sense of accomplishment, applauded by the fawning masses, nevertheless serves only as a monument to her ultimate lack of consequence.<br /><br />Streep's stupendous performance is framed extremely well by Anne Hathaway's rendition of Andie Sachs, the bumbling, styleless, writer-cum-fashion-expert and \\"second assistant\\" to Miranda and Stanley Tucci as Nigel, the fashion director for the glossy glamor magazine.<br /><br />Notwithstanding these superb performances, however, The Devil Wears Prada is a lightweight piece of fluff, good for a few hours of entertainment and relief from the summer heat, but not much besides.<br /><br />This film is cute, but nothing special.

0140187650|4.0|\\"For, obviously, things were not so simple as the framers of the laws had imagined them to be, and if it was of small legal relevance, it was of great political interest to know how long it takes for an average person to overcome his innate repugnance of crime, and what exactly happens to him once he has reached that point. To this question, the case of Adolf Eichmann supplied an answer that could not have been clearer or more precise.\\" (Eichmann in Jerusalem, Chr. VI) <br /> <br />Hannah Arendt's \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem\\" is many things. It is a detailed report on the trial of Adolf Eichmann for war crimes, it is a history of the Holocaust through the lens of the said trial, it is a psychological probe into Eichmann himself, and it is a philosophical rumination on what makes average people do bad things. Arendt manages to straddle between these layers seemlessly.  <br /> <br />Of most interest to its readers - and the original cause of the book's controversey - are the last two: the psychology and philosophy parts. Arendt's report overthrows, or at least calls into question, the prevalent view of what evil is. Eichmann did evil things, she tells us, but was not really himself evil. He was many things - a fairly uneducated and unreflexive man, ambitious to a fault, and easily swayed. But was he evil? If by 'evil,' we mean 'someone who sets out or derives pleasure from doing bad things,' then the answer must be: no.  <br /> <br />In fact, a most revealing moment sees Eichmann invoking the name of Kant to put a more positive spin on his action, adding that once the \\"final solution\\" was ordered by Hitler, Hitler's will supplanted Eichmann's own. (\\"Act in such a way that the Fuhrer, if he knew your action, would approve.\\") So we see a man who reasons thus: \\"I admire Hitler, and as such, if he says it, it must be right.\\" Pretty chilling stuff. It is small wonder this book stirred such controversey. Who wants to think of \\"evil\\" being conducted not by snarling criminal masterminds, but by bumbling \\"John Q. Public\\"s just following orders?! <br /> <br />In all this it should be noted that Arendt keeps a very ambivalent tone. It may seem like she is trying to excuse Eichmann. She is not, and she admits several times that she is extremely skeptical of much of his justificatory rhetoric. At the same time that she is not trying to excuse him, she IS trying to explain him - something that is so little done because of the emotion attached to the subject (as evidenced by the very shallow review directly below mine chronologically). Arendt straddles the fence between trying to understand Eichmann on his terms, and trying to challenge Eichmann on hers.  <br /> <br />To conclude, this book is of immense value to anyone who honestly wants to understand how such a thing as the Holocaust (or any large human-made catastrophe on a grande scale) could happen. Does it take a group of evil people, or does it just take a group willing to 'follow the orders'? As already suggested, this would be a good companion piece, or segue, to Arend't \\"Origin of Totalitarianism.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0553804677|5.0|Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch is the first book in the Gentlemen Bastards series. Not only is it the first in the Gentlemen Bastards series, but this novel happens to be the first novel published by Mr. Lynch as well. When I first heard that this was a debut novel I was slightly hesitant, but it came with a glowing recommendation so I took the chance. Let me say right off the bat that I am very thankful that I took the chance on this new author as this novel is absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />There are several aspects of this novel that I think need to be reviewed.<br /><br />The characters really allow this novel to stand out and shine. The characters are well developed and vivid. Each character is done in such a way that they all appear unique, anything from their look to their dialog. While Mr. Lynch has added many curse words, which at times, for me anyway, shocks the reader out of the dialog, it also seems to bring a grittiness to the characters. There are quite a few characters in this novel, but I didn't find any difficulty in keeping them separate and knowing what each was doing. The main character, who I would struggle to call a hero, is a rogue who is bent on stealing from the nobles of the cit. A Robin Hood type character if you will. Mr. Lynch goes to great detail to explain and develop Locke throughout the book, and he pulls this off very well. The other assortment of characters are developed at varying degrees. This just makes sense or else the book would be huge. In my opinion the supporting cast of characters are done perfectly, not too much and not to little. There are many truly memorable characters in this book.<br /><br />The plot, on the surface anyway, seems rather simple in that the main character is a rogue set on fleecing the nobility out of their wealth. However, there are many things that Mr. Lynch tosses into the mix to make this a much more complicated story than just your typical steal from the rich story. This story follows Locke from when he was a very young boy all the way up to his involvement with the Gentlemen Bastards and the escapades that he routinely pulls on the noble class of the city. There are several twists and mysterious characters that are slowly added to add more depth to the story. Even though there are multiple elements added throughout the book they are not done so to cram things into this novel. It has a very steady pace and was obviously well mapped out. It's a well written plot and one that certainly leaves room for further development in later books.<br /><br />This novel is set up in an interesting way, in fact I have not seen a novel like this to my memory. There are regular chapters, but interspaced between these chapters, or sections really, there are flashbacks or as Lynch calls them interludes. Were he harkens back to past events that helped shape the characters actions and choices. This is certainly a unique way of putting a novel together and at times it works beautifully, but there is at least one point where I read an interlude and was a little unsure why it was included in the story or at that point in the book. For the most part though, this idea works rather well and adds a certain depth to the book.<br /><br />There are a few things that I wish would have been better developed, such the way magic works as well as a little more explanation of the `thirteen'. Since this is the first book in this series I expect that these things may be explained in greater detail later.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic book and one I am sure to recommend to many other people. It really is a gem and a surprising first release from a new author. I wonder just how good Mr. Lynch will become if this was the first release from him. I am eagerly looking forward to the second book in this series as I am sure many others will be once they give this novel a chance. Have no fear in picking this up, I think it will appease many a different fans. Certainly fantasy fans, but also others will probably like this as well.y fans, but also others will probably like this as well. <br />

Picoult's characters are easy to relate to- no matter what side of this ethical dilemma they're on.

This book made me remember the human side to providing health care and that as a person, I have to be ready to treat the person and not just the disease they have. I thought this book was well-written... I had a hard time putting it down once I started. So if you have the time... pick this one up- I think it's worth a shot... but that's just my opinion.

B00005JOQS|3.0|It was a visually stunning film but several things ruin it for me despite my being a sci fi fan and one who is willing to suspend disbelief if you give me something to hang onto.    Why oh why would a super genius like Lex Luther hang around with such a bunch of comic relief goofs?  I like the Lex in Smallville much better.  Give me more Machiavelli, more subtly and a plan that makes sense.  Who the hell wants to live on a big damned crystal, especially after you've killed billions of people to \\"build\\" it?  Besides, other than having the crystal technology, what's to prevent the rest of the world from delivering a good old fashioned retaliatory Nuking to this bald headed numbskulls city/continent?  Don't tell me that he was holding weapons in reserve, if he had them he'd have used them on Supes.    Why in the heck would Lois Lane hear music that reminds her of perhaps Lex, a known murderous madman and then wander on to his boat with her own child.  Call child services now!     As to the person before me who was creeped out by Superman using his powers to stalk Lois at her house, listen in on their private conversations and such, yeah it left me squirming as well.     What is with all the Christ like poses in this film?  It makes some sense that people would see him as a \\"savior\\" but why beat me over the head with it about 5 times, including a resurrection!  I get what you are trying to say.  I suppose they will remind me again in the next film with a Church of Superman congregation branching out from Metropolis to Gotham.    Could Superman seem more like the egomaniac when he prevents a plane tragedy and stands around smirking while soaking up the adulation?  Who writes this stuff. Superman is supposed to be incredibly humble.    Why is Mr. White now played by a British actor?  Were there no American actors available after reading the script?  I know, this is a petty criticism but c'mon, that's the only plausible explanation for him to not say \\"and the American way\\"isn't it?    ***SPOILER TIME - Stop Reading If You Haven't Seen It: So now Lois Lane is the poster child for unsafe sex?  In addition, how exactly could she not know about her kid's origins or talent?  I mean, I get that Clark is a geek and Supes can appear to be in 2 places at once to back his alibi, thus people don't really suspect him, but jeez she is an \\"ace\\" investigative journalist and she doesn't notice her kid has some strange powers?    If they had simply given me a bright, mean ruthless Lex, who had able cohorts, I could have loved this film.  Honestly!  I truly wanted to love it and all I got was a middle of the road result.
B00005JOQS|3.0|I enjoyed this.  The special effects were excellent  - there's now virtually nothing they can't do, and everyone on the cast were talented and likable.     But I have to subtract two stars because..this felt like the imitation of a great movie, rather than a great original work of Film.  I've seen so many Supermans that this one felt like a retread when it needed something vibrant and alive and new.    They borrowed the Marlon Brando bit..virtually every word of dialog here sounded canned and predictable.  This is a kids movie..while the first two Superman films written by Mario Puzo (the Godfather series) really built a whole new legend and franchise. Brandon Routh's superman seems shallower .. He's likable, but he just doesn't have enough to say..probably because this is supposed to be a sequel to Superman II from 1981, so the whole stage has been set already.. But it's been 23 years and this is a new work, and as such it lacked personality.    It's had a good opening weekend and generally good press, but I predict it won't have much staying power.  They spent $200M+ on this thing. There are better screenwriters out there..  Maybe next time.

I had thought TLS was that special soundtrack that recreates the movie in your mind, allowing you to just relax and let the music take you where it will...<br /><br />I was wrong. Gladiator is better. Much, much better.<br /><br />Gladiator takes you beyond just recreating the movie for you to watch in your mind. It puts you in the movie. You can hear some of the best lines echoing in your ears and see the battle all around you.<br /><br />So you think I'm weird, right? How can a soundtrack do so much?<br /><br />Well...the music itself is just fantastic. Hans Zimmer--you rock!. It captures the emotions of the moment, from anticipation to fear to pain to heartbreak, but doesn't overpower you--it's all very subtle. The choir in the background adds another dimension. The orchestra is also astounding...<br /><br />And when all those elements come together, it equals the best soundtrack for one of the best movies. Buy it--you'll be glad you did.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Magnificent in every respect, this film MUST be seen by every American. The filmmakers were able to combine intelligence with grace in their depiction of the great decisive battle of Gettsyburg. The events are clearly illustrated; the performances are unforgettable.

They turn to an alliance with Russia in order to avoid this but people like Feliks don't want to see Mother Russia pulled into a fight that will leave the common man killed and the old regime in tact.

B000ANVQ0K|4.0|The strength of Titanic is that we come to genuinely care for Kate and Leonardo during the first half of the movie, so that when the second-half disaster sequence ensues, we are emotional invested in the thrilling struggle for survival as the \\"unsinkable\\" luxury liner sinks, cracks apart, and submerges.  Titanic is also better than your typical disaster flick because we come to care about the common folk who populate the steerage and the working people who make the ship run.  When disaster strikes, you really feel for these people as they struggle for survival against all odds.  Although the disaster sequence is quite lengthy, interest is maintained as focus alternates between travails of Kate&Leonardo and the other passengers of the boat.  The dramatic arc of the film is superb.  Each phase of the disaster is thrilling.  And although the (titanically-expensive) art direction feels like a movie set, it sufficiently satisfies as the setting for this large drama without screaming \\"look at me\\" too often.  Our hearts and eyes stay on Kate&Leonardo throughout.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, Titaninc has major flaws (therefore needing to be knocked down a peg).  First in my estimation, is the dialogue.  The dialogue was written at about the level of 7-year-old.  So, it doesn't surprise me that children flip over this movie.  The fact that Titanc was ridiculously popular does not validate its laundry list of Academy Award nominations (in paritcular the Best Screenplay nomination).  Fortunately, the drama is buoyed by some good acting, particularly Kate Winslet, DiCapprio, and Kathy Bates.  It is said that acting is the art of listening and responding.  It is the manner in which Winslet listens and responds to DiCapprio that really makes the romance believable.  Not that DiCapprio is bad, but Winslet's performance makes their duo greater than the sum of its parts.  Similarly, Kathy Bates's response to the snobbery and cold-bloodedness she encounters brings life to the class warfare on the board the ship.  <br /> <br />I also must strongly disagree with the accolades for the soundtrack and title song.  The music is uninspired and vapid.  It is not bad, and at least it does not detract from the movie.  But, there is nothing extraordinary about it in the least.   <br /> <br />Other weaknesses are the flimsy one-dimensional characterizations.  The only sympathy we are allowed to have for any of the upper class passengers is when we discover that Kate Winslet's mother has a motivation beyond pure greed.  The character of the greedy, unscrupulous, jealous, and immoral Cal only serves to provide an antagonist to Kate&Leonardo.  Each act of heartless aggression from Cal provokes an equally heroic and steadfast response from the not-so-young couple.  Any dispute over whether Cal really loves Kate is pointless.  Attempting to examine his motives is pointless.  Cal's actions service the plot and the action of the film, nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br />Titanic is a fun, heart-warming ride which most audiences will enjoy, but don't expect anything deep, profound, or intelligent.  Do expect to shed some tears and to walk away floating on a cloud of romance and nostalgia (if you allow yourself to indulge in the fantasy).
6304698526|5.0|It's not all about the most famous car chase scene in cinematic history, but that one extended scene does make Bullitt one of those rites of passage every serious movie fan must experience at some point in his/her life.  This really is an unusual film in many ways; as much as it influenced scores of future films in the tough, gritty cop genre, it's still unique.  More modern-day maverick cops spend half their time playing the fool, destroying half their cities, throwing random hissy fits, and posturing a lot.  Steve McQueen didn't have to posture because he was the real deal.  He could have gone through this entire movie without uttering a single word and still been hailed by fans and critics alike.<br /><br />Bullitt sports an amazing cast: alongside Steve McQueen you have the lovely Jacqueline Bissett, Robert Vaughn, Robert Duvall, Norman \\"Mr. Roper\\" Fell, Victor \\"Mel\\" Tayback, and plenty of other actors I'm not familiar with serving up sustained dramatic brilliance.  Let's hope they never try to remake this classic, especially since this movie's style would never pass muster at any Hollywood studio of the 21st century.  Bullitt doesn't come right out and explain everything to you at the beginning, nor does it take the time to explicitly identify important clues as the investigation progresses.  You can go several minutes at a time without hearing a word of dialogue.  It's not a difficult movie to follow, but you do need to pay attention as a viewer.  A few scenes seem superfluous, but I think that sort of adds even more to the Bullitt mystique.  The final scene, for example, is quite subdued and unlike anything you'll find preceding any closing credits today.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, Lieutenant Bullitt (McQueen) is assigned to guard a Mob witness set to testify against his old buddies.  Walter Chalmers, a local prosecutor with political ambitions (Robert Vaughn, who's a natural at portraying sleazy politicos) is frothing at the mouth at the thought of all the publicity he'll get when his witness blows the lid on some major league players in organized crime.  It turns out that the secret hiding place isn't a secret after all, and everything pretty much goes to heck, leaving the star witness fighting for his life while Bullitt finds himself in the crosshairs of an unhappy Chalmers.  Already detecting the faint but undeniable odor of a rat, Bullitt truly takes charge of the whole investigation, even as Chalmers pressures the higher-ups in the police department to give Bullitt's lease several long, hard yanks.  Now, as the action begins to ratchet up minute by minute, the plot gets curiouser and curiouser - and Bullitt's job more dangerous.  The famous car chase up and down the streets of San Francisco is the highlight of the movie, but there's plenty of action all the way to the end.<br /><br />The secret of the car chase's success is realism: no music, just tires squalling and engines revving (even if they're not always in perfect synch), with a great mix of external shots and point-of-view shots from inside Bullitt's Mustang, putting you right there zooming up and down the steep hills of San Francisco.  The editing of this scene brought home an Oscar, and it's as thrilling today as it was in 1968 - despite the fact that several continuity errors are easily detected in the editing (that little green Doodlebug just keeps popping up, doesn't it?).<br /><br />It's hard to really describe this film for others, although I can point out that, in terms of the action, it rejects melodrama in favor of authenticity.  On the face of things, it sounds like a movie that shouldn't be all that special - but it is (at least for men; I'm not sure the movie will appeal to a lot of female viewers).  The best way I can explain why this is so is to say this: Steve McQueen is the man.ought of all the publicity he'll get when his witness blows the lid on some major league players in organized crime.

B00008438V|5.0|This movie  (like all of John Hughes' films) was very enjoyable. Anthony Micheal Hall is hilarious. The director must have just let him improvise on his lines as the camera began to roll. Robert Downey and Robert Russler are perfect jerks. The scenes with Downey and Russler are usually the most entertaining. Plenty of funny scenes. Love Chet (Paxton) and his oneliners. Very funny, the more I watch it the more I pick up on something Chet said that I didn't catch before that shows how dumb he is. One of the funniest scenes is when a dissapointed Chet takes off his towel and gives it to his younger brother, asking him to cover himself. Love the scene, during the second experiment, when Robert Downey yells that he is defecating in his pants at the top of his lungs. Enjoy if your a fan of 80s movies. Hopefully the t.v. show will be available some day.
B000005J08|5.0|For an Artist such as \\"John Zorn\\", who has run such a impressive range of genres that his music touches upon: (Free Jazz, Film Music, Improvisation, Rock, Metal, compositional, Jazz, lounge, cabaret, thrash, semi-ambient, post-classical ...etc), and music that wildly jump-cuts through these styles, and offers up such a huge plethora of diverse sounds, his music can seem bewilderingly and often overwhelming to the initiated.  And liking one album, doesn't necessarily mean that you'll like another.   One album can sound so radically different for another and feature such an unpredictable approach to music, that its hard to really recommend his music, to anyone expect those that like to be challenged by music or are musically adventurous.  And with such a large catalogue of albums to choose from, such as the eccentric reinterpretation/re-imaging of film scores \\"John Zorn Plays the music of Ennio Morricone\\", through to the impressionistic musical approach and stretches of modern compositional live-music jazz of the strangely dark mood music of \\"Spillane\\".  And that's not even mentioning the experimental and violent sounding passages of the Jazz/ambient/Noise fusion that is a fetishist's wet-dream, in the largely disturbing \\"Torture Garden\\".  Which sit uncomfortably alongside the dark harmonics, and minimalistally arranged string quartet, and pronounced, sombre late-century classical music of \\"Cartoon S&M\\".   <br /> <br />It would then be fair to argue that, although a lot of Zorn's albums could be considered essential, not all (even possibly only a few), could be recommended to the majority of listeners of his work.  What works for one listener, won't necessarily work for another.  So it's hard to single out one of Zorn's albums that would be a good recommendation for most listeners.  But if such an album of his exists, then most people would agree that his astonishing \\"Naked City\\" album, would be as damn close to being considered his most universally liked/appreciatedwork.  Nobody's saying it's his best album (although many, may well...believe it is), but it's an album that most, that have listened to Zorn's work, will agree is a brilliant starting point for his work.  Judging by the controversial image on the album cover of a man lying dead after a fatal shooting, this is wildly disorientating album of tracks that run the gauntlet of : hardcore, rock, skewered country, sleazy jazz, thrash, Punk, Lounge, experimental, free improvisation & avant-garde & metal, and tracks regularly switch and morph into different styles and moods and musical shapes (and sometimes during the course of a track).  The imagination and arrangements that have gone into creating this album is by and large, quite staggering.  It's not an easy listen by any stretch of the imagination, and only those that like their music adventurous need apply.  Because if you were to take this CD into a normal group environment, and play this for your friends, then unless they share the same open-ended approach to music that you do, then it's fair to say that both you (and your Cd) will be asked to leave. <br /> <br />The music shifts from moody film-noir pieces one minute, that conjures up images of seedy back alleys and shady characters....(think a musical take on \\"Sin City\\") luring you in with it's sombre mood, but then the next track is a relentlessly pounding passage  of agitated saxophone wailing thrash-jazz, that references the more extreme end of Ornette Coleman & John Coltrane's work.  With the passionate and energetically exuberant wig-out of tracks such as these.  And it's a shock to the system the first couple of times you hear it, but its undeniably thrilling and very much like...flying on the seat of your pants via music.  The performances here are without doubt exceptional and although the album sounds like nothing even remotely sounding like approaching structured, it is actually a carefully composed and arranged album, that has regular moments of improvisational sounds and Free-arrangements.  It's an album that tackles abstract movie themes one minute, and then shrugs them off to dive into modern creative noise rock the next.   Then its almost as if it wants to tackle straight ahead jazz (with a slightly sinister feel), then it take the intense of aggressive feel of metal, and imbue it with the mechanical and cold feeling of Industrial music, before switching back to a completely brutal and blistering take on Free-Jazz.  It's a staggering album, possibly one that threatens to overwhelm the listener, as it's a rapid-fire cross-section of musical styles, genres and fusion-orientated approaches that both impress and overwhelm in equal measures.  But once you made the commitment to the album, the perseverance begins to pay off, and what was at first a incredibly complex and unfocused album of random musical styles thrown together, with no consideration of what went before it, soon becomes a wonderfully idiosyncratic album.  It's a album that shows, how when the correct pieces (and performers) fall into place, how truly breathtaking music, can be created, and how a band that perform music in such extremes, can arguably deliver something so original and breathtaking, that you essential box yourself into a corner.  Any further continuation of this theme would merely be an additional companion, and never likely to scale the heights (and more importantly deliver the impact) of the first release, and likely to be a case of `Diminishing returns'.  And to do something any more radically different from this would essentially be a completely different product, and couldn't truly be associated with this album. <br /> <br />If you like your music to follow conventional structures and ideas, then the screaming saxophone, leftfield Jazz, and mind-bending organ pounding hard-hitting drums, mixed with, chugging trash guitar metal, will be a deal-breaker, and swiftly prompt the return of the cd.  But for those that have a fair idea of what to expect (that it is wildly varied challenging music), it'll over the course of several listens astound and surprise on many levels.  The fact that the band would go on to other explore aspects of music, rather than retread existing material, (and then later disband) is a crying shame, but Naked City arguably remains one of the most relentlessly innovate and progressively creative (as well as technically brilliant) albums of John Zorn prolific career. <br />

B000084T18|3.0|Just about everything bad and good has been said about this album. 50 Cent's major debut was a decent album in 2003 that was highly blown out of proportion on how good it was (sort of like Nelly's \\"Country Grammar\\") but there are some good parts to it and some bad parts to it. 50 Cent's gangsta attitude would be shown all over the album, mostly about guns, sex, drugs, and money. The 2003 rap song of the year \\"In Da Club\\" was overrated to me, but it was a decent track at best. The second single \\"21 ?'s\\" I hated because of it's pop style and lack luster beat that it carries. The third single \\"Many Men\\" was one of my favorite tracks that was dedicated to more violence. The fourth single \\"P.I.M.P.\\" was a medicore song about pimping on the origonal version, although the remix that features Snoop Dogg and G-Unit that doesn't appear on here is better. The rest of the tracks range from decent to good that will make your head nod, some I enjoyed and some that I hated. \\"Patiently Waiting\\" featuring Eminem is possibly one of the best songs on the album, as both of them have above average verses. The track \\"If I Can't\\" has a fast paced piano beat, that makes the song gangsta and listenable. \\"What Up Gangsta\\" will have little kids thinking they're hardcore repeating that song, because of it's catchy hook. 50 Cent's slurred vocals could get a liitle annoying at some parts of the CD, because he was shot in the jaw when he took those nine bullets.<br /><br />Production is done by Dr. Dre, Eminem, and more.<br />It sold about 9 million copies, so I'm pretty sure that most rap and alternative listener has at least taken a listen.<br /><br />Lyrics: C+<br />Production: B<br />Guest Appearances: B-<br />Musical Vibes: C+<br />Overall: C+<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Patiently Waiting, Many Men, If I Can't, Life's On The Line, Wanksta

6305558167|5.0|This is by far my favorite version of the King Arthur tale, and is one of the better adaptations of the story in the legend/storytelling perspective.  The newer King Arthur movie for 2004 is a supposed re-evaluation of potentially more historic evidence of King arthor, but this is the one that most of us know and I like.  The original score to this film is outstanding, and the effects and camera work are great for the time.  It follows Arthur from a boy to king by the luck of the sword excaliber, and the rise and fall of his empire. It ads new twist to the legend in that it has his sister as the sourceress that battle Merlin, and he has a son out of an ill-fated meeting with his sister (yeah, thats correct).  But the film still blows me away every time i see it, again, just a plain manly man film. Unfortunately it could also be a film rich in Dungeons & Dragon material, but i never did play that game, Just don't overlook this film because of this potential sterotype (no harm intended for those that play D&D). Not really a film a date might like, so rent something else when our with the ladies.  Just see this film
0807014265|5.0|Victor Frankl was an existentialist. The existentialists  went out of fashion in psychiatry because they were equated with a `be glad you're neurotic\\" approach, and denial of the reality of mental illness.  This was bad for the psychiatry business, although several existentialists made a living as psychiatrists. <br />The book is in two halves; the first describes his concentration camp experiences, the second his method of psychotherapy (or rather his philosophy of life) which he called logotherapy.  The first half is not irrelevant to the second half.  Some psychologists, such as Abraham Maslow, with his hierarchy of needs, suggest that issues like search for meaning are just icing on the cake of life.  They become irrelevant when the chips are down. A starving man does not worry about the state of world politics.  Frankl's experiences taught him that the will to go on living comes from some kind of inner force that is not just an animal survival instinct. <br />Is logotherapy really a treatment method, or should we consider this book as self-help? I think it is more useful as a book for patients than as a manual for therapists, although I hope it doesn't persuade them to throw away their Prozac.  It is full of illuminating insights and I found myself underlining many passages. Some of the actual techniques described, such as negative practice for obsessive rituals are more akin to behavior therapy than insight-oriented psychotherapy.  He describes several one-shot cures brought about by philosophical utterances which may have worked for him but are in the category of \\"don't try this at home\\" for less charismatic practitioners. His ideas about anhedonia and boredom are good. <br />
B000003JBM|4.0|Guru decided to create an experimental hip-hop album with a mix of jazz to create Jazzmatazz Vol. 1. To me I thought it was going to be one of many rap with jazzy production albums that came out in the early 90's, but this was different.Instead this time, he picked up some jazz musicians and singers. The guests include\\" Roy Ayers, Donald Byrd, Ronny Jordan, N'Dea Davenport, Carleen Anderson, Courtney Pine, Lonnie Liston, and french known rapper MC Solar, amd many more.<br /><br />Most of the tracks Guru rhymes while the jazz musicians play and sing, which mostly comes out well for the most part. His monotone voice sometimes blend in with the musical vibes on many storytelling vibe tracks like \\"Down The Backstreets\\" and the loud alto saxophone produced \\"Transit Ride\\". Another nice track is \\"No Time To Play\\" with DC Lee singing and Ronny Jordan on the guitars. Production wise is outstandig because it is somewhat live instruments, but not how you'll expect on something like any early Roots' albums or such.<br /><br />Some tracks I disliked though toward the end of the abum. \\"Slicker Than Most\\" and \\"Le Bien, Le Mal\\" didn't appeal to me, probably because they changed the mood of the album, and it seemed to be more rapping than jazz making it unbalanced. Lyrically Guru comes off decent on some tracks, which isn't a big deal to many listeners becuase they're not paying attention to that. Other than that it is a very enjoyable album that suffers some flaws. If you like Hip Hop and Jazz, or if you have a taste for experemental music, I recommend this one to you.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Loungin', Transit Ride, No Time To Play, Down The Backstreets, Trust Me, Sights In The City.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|2006 man !!! <br />We deserve a DVD .........
B00005RYL9|4.0|I honestly gave this item a 4 star rating because I love the Highlander movies.  This particular edition is in a tin sleeve that does make it look nice. It also includes the bonus DVD of Queen videos.  This version is the director's cut edition released at the 10th anniversary edition.  A true collector likely has both original and the 10th aniversary edition in their collection in some form.  Unfortunately, the original theatrical version i don't believe has ever been released on DVD.  I do love the scene in the directors cut in WWII, just entertaining, but not all that necessary.  Some of the extended scenes in the Madison Square garden are good as well. I particularly like the extened dual scene.  The quality of the film is adequate for DVD, but again being an older film the conversion to DVD has brought out some of the fuzziness, but isn't that just nostalgia. Its better than VHS by far still, although i agree my laserdisc versions are nice.  So this is a good addition for a collection to add some more history and historicalness to the film collection, but not a must get. The 10th anniversary edition is good enough for just a movie fan, and pick up the original on VHS for comparison.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I won't go on and on about how great Johnnt Cash was (and still is).  If you don't know by now what a wonderful musician, artist, and man Cash was, you either don't belong here, or you need to stop reading this review and buy the darn album.  Johnny Cash was legendary; one cannot hope to accurately summarize all the talents and qualities that made him so.<br /><br />\\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" is a beautiful record.  True, Cash's voice falters on many tracks; recorded near the end of his life, after the death of his beloved wife June Carter Cash, the Man in Black was not at his peak.  However, any miscalculations on his part, any slip-up he makes, lends to the humanity of these tunes.  Try not to be moved as he forces his way through \\"If You Could Read My Mind,\\" \\"Like the 309,\\" \\"Help Me,\\" \\"On the Evening Train,\\" and \\"A Legend in My Time.\\"  Try not to shout \\"hallelujah\\" on \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down.\\"  Try not to sing along with \\"Further On Up the Road.\\"  Just try not to enjoy this masterful record.<br /><br />One of Cash's many talents was the ability to make any song his own (here's the obligatory reference to \\"Hurt\\").  Though he did indeed write two songs on here (\\"I Came to Believe\\" and \\"309,\\" the last song he wrote), it is the cover songs that shine.  Words and melodies from such tunesmiths as Larry Gatlin, Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Springsteen, Hank Williams, Rod McKuen, Ian Tyson, and Don Gibson lend credence to the life of the Man in Black, much as he lends credibility and tenderness to the tunes he sings.  \\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" is a beautiful, compelling record by a legend who will never be forgotten.  A true artist, a true human being, Johnny Cash left behind a legacy that extends beyond the music world.  However, it will always be his music that is remembered most fondly--and many of those timeless performances are found on this record.
B000067J1H|5.0|There is a lot of \\"tongue in cheek\\" in Fight Club.  Is it a commentary, a love story, a cry for help or just pulling your leg?  All three? <br /> <br />There are many dialectical strains in fight club; feminism versus Green anti-consumerism, passive \\"metrosexuality\\" versus troglodyte violence, an almost Luddite repudiation of modern life versus the use of Mind Control strategies to build a \\"movement\\". Plus a very confused view of self improvement.   <br /> <br />Moderation, self awareness, goal seeking, focus, and adopting healthy male models of behavior?  Breaking free of malignant anti-male feminism while embracing the good of the feminist movement that emphasizes that women are not property?  No. <br /> <br />In a sense you laugh along, in another you wonder who they're really making fun of here. <br /> <br />Ironies abound as well, a Doctor who refuses to prescribe sleep medication and instead prescribes \\"exercise and valerian root\\", to black humor about automobile accidents to the female antagonist's dissolution that seems to parallel the main character's search for himself.  Not to mention what Tyler does to the Clam Chowder or what he splices into family movies. <br /> <br />One should not take this movie too seriously.  There are self help groups which endorse Fight Club, both the movie and book, as a sort of totem for masculinity.  Fight Club lampoons such groups too. <br /> <br />As for the acting; pretty good.  Brad Pitt is having fun.  Ed Norton is having fun.  Meat Loaf is probably having fun but not as much as fun as in \\"Rocky Horror Picture show\\".  The cinematography is wonderful, as is the sense of gritty dispair. <br />The soundtrack is quite good too. <br /> <br />Fight Club is a fine movie, just don't take it too seriously. <br /> <br />Gene
B000F6IOC0|1.0|I'm shocked at these reviews. Plot - hardly gone into. What was new from the first one? - thats where everything blew us away.  This second is nothing but a vampire porno, little on plot development, nothing new.  And this new vampire/werewolf - lost behind a female vampire who never needed him to begin with and, \\"really\\" - how many times did he get beat down.  Looks like the vampire is still on tops and the hybrid fell to the wayside.  Almost a side kick which the vampire should have been his mother and not a lover.  Little on emotion, YES there is gore, and porn.  The first film radiates brilliance and a nice breath of fresh air into the Vampire/Werewolf saga.  This second film degrades the first.  Nothing new in this film...its a sequel flop and will not sit beside the first Underworld film in my collection.
B00005JLWN|4.0|This film is a great action film, a must see if you love fight sceens.  A film that slipped by most radars in late 2002, Christian Bale (Batman Begins, Reign of Fire, the Machinist, American Psycho) plays a Graviton Cleric, a futeristic officer used to enfore the laws against sense crimes.  This movie is based off a \\"1984\\" plot in a post WWIII world in which people take a drug, prozium, to prevent feelings.  It also has the \\"Father\\" government figure as well.  It also carries a flavor of Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 as well.  Although this plot has been used and abused in the past, and again can be tiresome in this film, the action sceens in this film toast any prior film like this.  It starts off with arguably one of the best gun encounters in any movie, and goes on from there. The final scenerio is something that makes any guy feel like a ten year old, wanting to imitate the moves that the cleric does.  The camera work was also well done, and the sets were nice, not overdone with to much computer backgrounds.  Christian Bale plays the part exceptionally well, and Taye Diggs does fair as far as the action, but fails on the flattness of Affect needed in this role. His acting did seem to give the plot away early if you pick up on the hints quickly.  So if you want to see a good action movie, this is a must see. I believe it was this role that landed Christian Bale his role in Batman Begins, so if you like Batman, then you'll definitely like this.
B00005JO20|5.0|A beautifully filmed tragic fantasy of a force of nature finding a little solace before its inescapable demise. The film seems to take a long time to get started and Jack Black muggs more than he acts. But once on Skull island the movie just takes off. It would have been great to learn why the natives turn blonde white girls over to Kong and what happened to the other girls. But when a film is this good I'm willing to forget logic for a couple of hours.

B0000255CL|5.0|This is my second attempt at writing a review for ATHOW. I don't know what happened to the first one. But, I'm sure none of you really care!! HAHA. ATHOW is very close to being the best metal record I own. The guitar work by Abbath is bone-crushing, and the drumming by Horgh is phenominal. But, the real excellence is Peter Tagtgren's production.  He brings to life what these musicians are conveying. Superb. Immortal have created an amazing metal \\"fantasy\\" with all their records. Brilliant. Immortal is now reforming and will open the Wacken Festival in Germany in 2007. Be there if you can, if not buy this and \\"Sons of Northern Darkness.\\"
B000056N8X|4.0|The fourth Highlander movie, this one attempts to incorperate the Television series and the original movie.  Again, I think the original movie stood alone, and the rest has never quite mesured up to it, but each movie is good in its own way.  If your a fan of the show, this is essentially an expansion of it. It does not have the same feel as the first three movies at all.  But, the action and storyline is interesting in how they develop and have adapted the original story to fit the need of the film.  The action again is good, and you have to like the fight between the Mcclouds.  I like this DVD because you essentially get 2 Movies in one set, one being the original cut, which really wasn't to bad.  The extened ending was hokey though.  In all, not a bad film, and a different twist on the highlander plot.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|As I read all the other reviews,I was gratified to find that the overwhelming opinion of this collaboration was more than favorable. To paraphrase a previous reviewer (and I was thinking this before I read his review), Mark Knopfler could don a clown suit, stand in a garbage can and recite Ogden Nash and I would hang on every word,but I must say that together - and like many, I have never really listened to Emmylou before - the teaming is incredible. Of course, there are fans who will buy according to preferences to one or the other,but taken as a whole,nobody should be disappointed. I flew halfway across the country ten days ago to see them in New York and it was worth being broke for the rest of the year. The mutual respect they showed for each other - and Mark's humble accolades for both his band and Emmylou,completely downplaying his own efforts,as though he were a hitcher they picked up along the way - was a tangible presence at Radio City, and they got standing ovations several times. I know myself I could have listened to a couple more hours of them.On the album, \\"Beachcombing\\",\\"I Dug Up A Diamond\\", \\"Rollin' On\\" and \\"All The Roadrunning\\" were my favourites but the whole album is excellent - and I've never been a fan of anybody's duet efforts before. I look forward to their next collaboration - from what I've heard them say in interviews, there will definitely be more from them.
068987474X|4.0|If you are a woman blinded by love (or lust) and your friends have been gently telling you that you have been acting like a helpless but devoted doormat (i.e. they're refusing to talk to you about your looser hopeless love-interest/non-boyfriend, or they suddenly have an urgent matter to attend each time you ask them for \\"relationship advice.\\"), you need to read this book and have some senses slapped into you, ASAP!!!  However, if you are a woman of at least the average self-confidence and self-worth of a non-American woman (i.e. any woman from the \\"Old Countries,\\" Communist countries, or \\"Developing Countries\\"), you'll find this to be entertaining at best.  The most troublesome advice of this book is \\"Woman should never make the first move.\\"  At least 50% of all happy and successful relationships I know started with the woman making the first move. They didn't chase the man, but they did make the first move(s). Even the woman who originally recommended this book to me did not follow this...\\"quaint\\" advice; she made the first THREE moves and now have a boyfriend that completely worships her! Contrary to what most men (and obviously this author) like to believe, it is ultimately the woman who do the choosing!  So, even when we don't make the first overt moves (e.g. ask a man out on a date), we still do the choosing by the way we subtly (or not) encourage the men we're interested in to make the first move.   (And by the way, in this day and age, what street-smart single urban woman would give a guy her number BEFORE gettting his number first, especially if this the first time they've met at a random place, say a bar?! If he comes with references - as in a friend of a friend of a friend or co-worker, maybe - but someone completely new and random, she's either crazy or naive if she gives her number first!) So, this book would be a lot more useful if it actually tells woman how to encourage the man she's interested in to make the first move! Aside from this Neanderthal advice, the rest of the book can be useful, especially if you've found yourself engage in \\"Relationship by Committee\\" - you're asking your friends the meaning of his every (or most) word and action.   Actually, just save your money. Having been there done that, I can tell you if you find yourself doing that, it's time to run for the door and look for greener pastures, period! Life is too short to tip-toe around anyone who makes you doubt yourself! If you still try to \\"make it work\\" after he makes you doubt yourself, then you would be \\"chasing\\" him and completely wasting your time!  Instead, go find a man who adores you.  Just keep in mind, you might have to make the first move(s), and it's perfectly OKAY if you do, as long as you don't chase! In fact, you might end up with the boyfriend (or husband) of your dreams!
0380973634|5.0|From the moment when we meet Richard Mayhew and Door, we can dive into the mysterious world of Neil Gaiman's imagination in \\"Neverwhere\\".<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" means the underground London, where the time and space are totally different than in the \\"London above\\" (the name the inhabitants of the \\"below\\" use when talking about the city), where the contemporary laws and traditions don't work, wkere rats speak and strange inhuman creatures mingle with outcasts and aristocracy, where people have supernatural powers and special abilities, but learning that is not enough to live there, because not everything is as it seems.<br /><br />Richard's life changes completely after he meets a wounded girl (Door) and helps her. The next morning he is invisible, his job disappears, his flat is rented to someone else and he has no other choice but to look for Door and therefore go deeper (literally!) into her world, helping her solve the mystery and avenge the murder of her family, participating in the events he would never dream of before.<br /><br />This is just a beginning of a great journey and a first-class fantasy, although I am not even sure if \\"fantasy\\" is a good word for this novel, because Gaiman created an entirely new quality, which may not be so easily classified. His universe is so intriguing that when the book ends, there is nothing but the wish for more...<br /><br />Gaiman's ability to produce something absolutely new, painting in reader's mind original cityscapes and the surprising adventures of the characters, who are also great and, although usually sketched in a few words, impressively individual and unique (Door, Richard, Marquis de Carabas, the guard Hunter, Angel Islington, the eternal mercenaries Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar), is worth mentioning. It is also worth mentioning that the London Tube, its history and map, play a vital part in the story (as well as the roofs). I was only surprised by one obvious error (unless I don't know something), where the Black Friar \\"wore the black robes of a Dominican monk\\". ????. Dominican monks wear white robes, don't they? But never mind, the book is excellent and even if there were more mistakes of such sort, they do not spoil its beauty. The British movie, although it has all the faults of the film done after the very good book and forcing the director's vision instead of the reader's imagined one, being additionally a rather low-budget production, is nevertheless a good screening and can be recommended as well.of a Dominican monk\\". ????.

0140564349|5.0|This edition is a reprint of a classic book telling the tale of a mother duck trying to move her ducklings across the city to a new home. I use to get the biggest bang out of this book, and still do, imagining all the people taking time out to stop for the little duck family.  It is a piece of history to hold on to, reminding everyone to stop once in a while and enjoy the small things going on around us, and to respect nature and its animals.  Although I don't know if the book was intended to make that big impact, reflecting on it now, especially as many towns expand, certainly brings this up. This is a must have book for the family collection to read before bedtime.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I do not question greatness but accept that a mind constantly moving forward is going to arrive at new horizons that may or may not be appreciated by everyone. Mark Knopfler listens to his own muse, and if the average fan does not get the wickedly clever nuances of tunes like \\"Don't Crash The Ambulance\\" (one of my favourites), then they are stuck in a time warp and would not be happy with anything but blazing riffs. I can tell you - because I am there now - age has its privileges, and one of them is the freedom to adapt and grow. This album is only the most recent indication that Mark will not remain static in his role as composer but will continue to challenge our abilities to interpret his music - to smile at a joke suddenly caught in the lyrics of a song like \\"boom, like that\\", or to be honoured that he would share something as personal as a song like \\"All That Matters\\" which to me sounds like a lullabye written for his children. It does not bother me - and it probably doesn't bother him - that there are those who won't get some of his music as he evolves. This is a first-rate work from a man who continues to surprise and please. There is not a song on this album that isn't a little masterpiece of its own - and it can't be easy, or everybody could do it. I look forward eagerly to his next solo work, and am confident that i won't be disappointed. He hasn't disappointed me since 1979. I appreciate each new venture.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|When I first listened to the album (which was actually a preview session I guess - listened to parts of each track) I was not taken up. But when I actually listened to it, I was so relaxed (actually took away a headache I had). Now when I am stressed out nothing works like this album. Works just great and delivers everytime - absolute satisfaction. Well done. When is the next one out?
B000301YY8|4.0|I like this artist and his music. I think we'll be listening to him for a long while to come. His music seems to be right from his heart.
0316666343|3.0|One's appreciation of this novel is likely to hinge on their accepting Sebold's set up of having the story told by Susie Salmon from heaven.  I just didn't think much of the way this set up was used.  Her heaven struck me as both cliched and odd.  Though there were some really nice touches from this set up with Susie having several profound observations on human nature and how a family copes with tragedy, my overall feeling was that it did not work.<br />  There are many things that I do not believe about  the characters that she has created, especially Susie's mother.  Her actions post her daughters death were despicable, but at least they weren't the least bit believable as well.  I'm not referring to her affair but to her deserting her other children.  Very little about this woman made any sense despite what she had gone through. I also found the grandmother cliched. The way the novel wrapped up was frustrating and also unbelievable.  In summary a very overrated novel and likely to be made into a lousy film as well.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|This movie tries to touch all the mideast bases . . . the importance of oil, decadence of present rulers, treating oil field workers practically as slaves, the frustration of change, the draw of terrorism, and, of course, the complicity of the shodowy agencies of the US government in all of this.  It was not as much of a story as a montage of the factors derived from our appetite for oil. <br /> <br />And which is the right side to be on . . . a Prince appears to have the answer, but that answer might be worse for the US than the status quo.  So, in the end, there is the same morass as in the beginning, and we are left with trying to figure out what the next step is.  The big picure answer is to eliminate our reliance on oil . . maybe that is the real message of this movie. <br /> <br />
B000E97HIA|4.0|I thought i might do something a little different with my review. It's hard to judge how to take a review until the person shows what else they like. When someone says this is his best cd since \\"emancipation\\" i will know to disregard it because that cd blowed. So i will give my thoughts on all of prince's cds as it can be cleary seen where i am coming from. <br /> <br />As a bit of background the first prince album i bought was \\"purple rain\\" but by the time \\"around the world in a day\\" came out i owned all of his albums. So here it is, hang in there. <br /> <br />1978 For You Warner - pretty good debut, not great but \\"soft and wet\\" showed us what was to come <br />1979 Prince Warner - getting better, and \\"i feel for you\\" is still one of my favourite prince tunes, so upbeat and carefree - chaka khan absolutely butchered it <br />1980 Dirty Mind Warner - his first great album, i was hooked from the first listen, no filler here <br />1981 Controversy Warner - a step backwards but how bad can an album be when it has \\"controversy\\" in there <br />1983 1999 Warner - back in the right direction, two classic songs in the title track and \\"lady cab driver\\" <br />1984 Purple Rain Warner - what a monster of an album, it was the first album i ever bought, when i heard \\"when doves cry\\" something clicked inside me and went straight to the store to buy the album <br />1985 Around the World in a Day Paisley Park - even better than purple rain, so different, so good, how did he do it <br />1986 Parade Paisley Park - prince could do no wrong, man i loved this album, he just kept getting better  <br />1987 Sign 'O' the Times Wea - this is not only prince's best ever cd but the best cd i have ever heard, i would call this cd perfect but \\"starfish and coffee\\" ruined that trip, it was going to be hard for him to top this one <br />1987 The Black Album WEA/Paisley - and so it was, a pretty funky cd, more like \\"times\\" outtakes but still great <br />1988 Lovesexy Warner - not great but two superb tracks in \\"i no\\" and \\"alphebet st\\", the worry was there are a couple of real stinkers in here, somethin i wasn't accoustomed to from prince <br />1989 Batman Warner - huh? so bland, a worrying sign <br />1990 Graffiti Bridge Paisley Park - this cd had it's moments but a bit of filler in here <br />1991 Diamonds and Pearls Warner - i hated this cd, hated it, i didn't buy it until i heard the wonderful \\"money don't matter tonight\\", everything else sucked on this cd although \\"daddy pop\\" wasn't too bad <br />1992 The Love Symbol Album Warner - prince back to form with this one, \\"sexy mf\\" gave us a taste and when \\"my name is prince\\" came on the radio i had to have the cd, great cd <br />1994 Come Pailsey Park - pretty good cd and the title track is so sexy, some filler but some great tracks too <br />1995 Gold Experience Warner - couldn't get into this cd, no song really did it for me, not bad but not good either <br />1996 Chaos & Disorder Warner - i don't know why but i absolutely loved this cd, maybe because it was so raw compared to how over produced his recent cds had become, ohh i like it there <br />1996 Emancipation NPG/EMI - after all the big deal prince made about making a cd he wanted to make he made me very excited about what was about to happen and then he put out this turkey, 3 cds of rubbish, \\"soul sanctuary\\" was great and i didn't mind \\"the human body\\" but the rest was batman soundtrack worthy ie - yuck <br />1998 New Power Soul NPG - i was so disappointed by emancipation i didn't even bother buying this one <br />1999 Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic NPG/Arista - again, not bad but not good either, bland <br />1999 Crystal Ball JWP - this would have been a killer single cd but 4 cds? i wasn't disappointed i bought it, some great songs in here <br />2001 The Rainbow Children Redline - i loved this cd, loved it because i expected nothing from it but it was great from start to finish <br />2003 N.E.W.S NPG - didn't buy it, don't know why, i suppose because ididn't hear any singles and i refused to buy blind <br />2004 Musicology NPG - heard the title track and it did nothing for me, so bland so i refused to buy the cd <br /> <br />Which brings us to \\"3121\\". When i heard \\"black sweat\\" on the radio i knew i had to have it, a true return to form. On first listen to the cd i thought uh-oh but the songs grew on me and i always looked forward to listening again. There is some filler here (incence and candles, the word, get on the boat) but also some great songs as well. Don't expect better than black sweat but this cd is worthy of being owned by prince fans who have been there for the long haul. <br /> <br />i hope like minded prince fans like myself will enjoy this cd. i'm gonna have to save this review now and use it fo the next prince cd. <br /> <br />
6304936303|5.0|This movie is the true Willis vehicle and Damon Wayans only eggs the Man on...If you're looking for Oscar material, get over it. But! if you're looking for a goodtime, then this is it. I love this movie and Bruce Willis is in true form in this flick, Wayans is awesome too. Sometimes you get tired of watching the Fat A---d Rich guy Win time and again. This Movie is about doing what's right, even if it means going about it the wrong way...you gotta do what you gotta do and Willis does, with a little help from his Friends. I was Cheering at the Explosive ending and I Love when a low life gets his. This is a non-stopper and it only lets up to let you catch your breath and then you're off again. Willis gives new meaning to getting a \\"light\\" for a cigarette and shows us that \\"Yes\\" he can dance a jig. Wanna have some fun? Wanna Cheer for the Underdog? Wanna see how a Man stands up when the chips are down or his Kid is in Danger? \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" is your ticket. Great Action Flick!
B000BCE918|4.0|This set contains the three current releases in the JP series, and seems like it might have a few more \\"Bonus Extras\\" on each disc, for what they're worth. It's not a bad deal, really, all three movies for twenty bucks, but I got the box set in 2001 which also contained all three movies, plus a fourth bonus disc called Beyond Jurassic Park (a documentary about the making of the movies with interviews with cast and crew), as well as bonus features on each disc, and I got that whole set for 19.99, so I definitely prefer that one. Still, though, this one's acceptable too.
6304698623|1.0|This movie added a world war, changed the continent the story took place on, and then brought the dead back to life. To me, once the essential elements of the author's story are that fundamentally altered, it's not fair to use the title anymore. I realize a number of the changes are a 'tribute' to the Shirley Temple version, but I'd hoped that since the new version wasn't a star vehicle they might have returned to more of the original storyline, but no. At least the first movie was on the correct continent! I like the movie, believe it or not, but it's not the story I read until the first book fell apart, and the changes to the story I listed weren't necessary, and it may have been nice to see that things can work out even when a parent stays dead.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|There is really no other word (other than its synonyms) to describe this movie. Batman Begins takes the movie Batman to a whole new level. You now know more about him then you did before. Batman is no longer that super hero with his trademark \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" humor. No, no, no. This is a darker much more serious Batman. <br /> <br />This movie has taken everything you thought you used to know about the caped crusader and basically, just threw it out the window. Thats not to say that the key elements of who Batman IS arent still there. He still is out for justice (or maybe its more for vengeance...) he still dwells in a cave on his huge estate and is still the millionaire self-made superhero with all the cool gadgets. Basically what this movie has done is taken all of the humor out of the Batman we saw in the previous movies. It takes a more serious approach and quite frankly its refreshing. I think that now we finally get to see the legendary Batman as we were ment to see him. Christopher Nolan has done what Tim Burton never did, and thats what makes this movie so great. Not to mention the great special effects and story behind it all. <br /> <br />Im sure over half of America has seen this movie. But in the case that you havent...let me just say you are missing out on a true piece of \\"Hollywood Magic\\".
B0002W18MU|3.0|Johnny Cash is back with the posthumous \\"American V\\". The sound is similar to the other \\"American Recording\\" albums, and it starts to feel a bit formulaic. It lacks the spark and engergy found in some of the predecessors.     Johnny Cash sounds very tired. The album starts off with the song/prayer \\"Help Me\\", on which he sounds more tired than ever, and this first impression sets the tone for most of the album. There's slightly more energy in song number two, \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\", but the lyrics of this song - as well as others on the album - is most likely to appeal to listeners of the Christian persuasion. The songs are mostly average, with no real standouts. My favorite song from the album is \\"Love's Been Good to Me\\". Cash makes a good performance and the production is better than most of the other songs. \\"Four Strong Winds\\" is also very beautiful.    Tired or not, Cash's voice is full of earnest emotion and fans will no doubt want to get this album, but were it not for the fact that these were his last recordings, it's unlikely that many of these songs would be remembered when talking about his best work. Someone just discovering Cash will be better off buying some other album first.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Blind Guardian has and always will be my favorite Power Metal band. Its hard for any one to do what they do and that is keep a consistent sound from album to album. <br /> <br />Blind Guardian really out did themselves with this one and when I heard it I was astounded. It has the perfect mix of relaxing and more heavy music on it. I've also always enjoyed the stories put out through their albums. I guess I could say that about almost all Power Metal bands but it is most appropriatly mentioned here. The singing is, as always, beautiful and you cant really top Hansi. If you can find a better Power Metal vocalist then please point me in his direction. <br /> <br />Blind Guardian is just a great band in general that should be apperciated by all. Metalheads and music lovers alike. This is just beautiful music. Dont pass it up.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I've owned Amnesiac for over a year and a half now.  I bought it just for Pyramid Song; I had no idea how many other unbelievable tracks were on this superb album:  1. Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box - 8/10  2. Pyramid Song - 10/10 (My favorite RH song that's been released so far)  3. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors - 7/10  4. You and Whose Army? - 10/10  5. I Might Be Wrong - 9/10  6. Knives Out - 9/10  7. Morning Bell/Amnesiac - 9/10  8. Dollars and Cents - 9/10  9. Hunting Bears - 7/10  10. Like Spinning Plates - 9/10  11. Life in a Glass House - 10/10  All of these songs have good things going for them.  There's not really much to say that's already been said by a lot of other people.  Amnesiac is one of the best albums they've ever made in my opinion; I reccomend buying it if you haven't already; give it time, give it a chance.

B00005JMUA|4.0|if i had not been set up by the first movie, id have given this a fifth star. it is indeed (i suppose) just as good as its partner, but i miss the sense of humor in part 1. and i miss gogo! still, carradine does neat homage to himself, and uma rox. <br />
B000BNI95Y|5.0|this bebe girl is awesome!! <br />i take her songs a lil bit feminist but its ok, a kind of encouragment for women or they feel identified etc. anyhow lyrics, rythm and voic is awesome, really good, except for one or 2 songs. a great cd! a must have

B0002W18MU|5.0|American Recordings vol. V is a tricky endeavor. Johnny Cash did the vocals for this record during the last months of his life, the instrumentations however were added two years after his death. Ethical questions are unavoidable as is the risk of such a project becoming a cheap chance to cash in. As it seemed the Unearthed boxed set was the closing piece of a beautiful career. So questions whether this release is justified are legitimate. Unearthed and American Recordings vol. IV already dealt with the inevitable end coming. Cash was already very much aware of his faltering health and in his music of that time reflected  on his coming death. Strong as it was the result was uneven. Vol. IV featured some of his best but some unfocussed material as well.     Vol. V regains this focus. Part of this focus seems to come from the passing June Carter Cash a few months prior to these recordings. Even more than on Vol. IV the record deals with loss, the end nearing, atonement and, as Cash is a religious man reunion after the last journey. Covers from other artists are put in entirely context all together. Bruce Springsteen's \\"Further Up on the Road\\" gets the air of an hymn as Cash sings \\"one sunny morning, we'll rise again I know\\". Something similar happens to Neil Young's \\"Four Strong Winds\\". Where Young's version aired the promise of starting anew, Cash's version feels like making amends. Vol V. brings us Cash at his most humble as he murmurs \\"Help me Lord\\" \\"One more smile, just one more smile\\".  We find him at his most vulnerable in \\"Legend of my Time\\" as he recounts his losses. He's at his most endearing in \\"Rose of my Heart\\" as he pledges his love to June for the last time, certain she can still hear him.    Throughout this record his voice sounds frail yet commanding as ever. We hear Cash struggle to reach his notes, his voice containing a fraction of the air it once had. Yet nowhere does Cash lose his power to grab you, to take you where he's going, even when that roadis the one we fear most but is as inevitable as breathing. The instrumentations are sparse and really reflect the mood of the record. Rick Rubin delivers a product of which I'm sure Cash would have approved. In interviews Cash often called Rubin his soul brother in  music, here Rubin accompanies him on his final journey. American Recordings Vol. V is a worthy and powerful epitaph.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|If you're not a Joss Whedon fan, if you're not a sci-fi fan, if you're not a western fan, there is still a chance you might enjoy this show.I am a fan none of these things  (in fact, I would say I hate a good number of those categories), but I still enjoyed the series enough to buy the DVDs. There are moments that are corny/cliche as well as moments that were not too well acted. The way in which Chinese and western culture is integrated is a little questionable. Although Chinese culture is an important aspect of the backdrop, there aren't really Chinese or Chinese American actors acting as a major charcter. In fact, I don't believe there is even a minor character. Also, in either the first or second episode the cast is walking through an international market sort of setting. There is a sign saying \\"Good Dog\\" posted above a barbeque area. This seems to suggest the stereotype that Chinese people eat dog, which is of course not good. But these moments are few and barely take away from the overall experience of the series.<br /><br />The strength of this series is what it tries to accomplish and the extent to which it does this. There is comedy, drama, action all well integrated into a well written and ambitious storyline. The dialogue and characterization is great. Almost all of the characters in this series are endearing. Three episodes in and you feel like you know the characters and want to continue to know them for a long time. The sci-fi and western elements of the show are executed in such a way that makes it accessible to non-fans as well as less gimicky, which I definitely appreciated.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series. Don't be afraid of the sci-fi and western. The storyline and characters is what relly gives it its appeal.
B00005ATQH|4.0|james mason and peter sellers are competing pederasts, vying for the affections of teenage nymphet (remember that word?) sue lyon. having never read the nabokov novel (the author wrote the screenplay in a rare moment of hollywood wisdom), i dont know how far this strays from the book, but the movie had to be pretty heady stuff for 1962 (unlike \\"mondo cane\\". mom & dad did NOT take 8 year old me to see this one). the movie does carry touches of director stanley kubricks to-be-expected mordant humor, and one wonders how different it might have been if made a mere 5 years later. still, second rate kubrick IS first rate anyone else, so ...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Netflixified this and watched all four DVDs one after another... an incredibly brilliantly conceived and executed series. <br /> <br />Love the CGI pan/zoom/out of focus thought and the great set. <br /> <br />An amazingly well-cast and fabulously captivating show. <br /> <br />Add my voice to the millions out there wanting this series back in production!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|i wavered over how many stars to give this movie, not being certain if i had been manipulated into my appreciation, but then i decided that if a movie can make me cry, i would give it its due. johnny depp is (for once) understated in his portrayal of james barrie in a fictionalized account of the circumstances surrounding the creation of \\"peter pan\\". my favorite moments were those that showed the stagecraft and acting techniques of a century ago, and of course the beautiful freddie highmore, whose merits i need not point out. probably not as good a movie as it thinks it is, but i still like it muchly. <br />
6305718954|5.0|When I saw this movie at the theatre I thought I was attending a horror movie. There are some pretty bloody scenes, but I don't consider this to be a horror film.    Patricia Arquette plays Frankie, a party girl and atheist who develops signs of the stigmata. Gabriel Byrne plays the priest from Vatican that is sent to investigate the validity of those symptoms. The situation creates conflicted emotions in both characters that play out well on the screen.    Even though this wasn't the horror film I was expecting, I was not disappointed. The acting and cinematography are good. Some of the special effects are realistically bloody, which is the reason I would recommend the movie for the adult audience only.
015626224X|5.0|The seedy side to being a bohemian in the 20s and 30's in dives and poverty in London and Paris. A real eye opener for one of my favourite writers. I dont think I could have done what he did to survive.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|SLIPKNOT IS A MATURING BAND THAT HAS MANY SIDES.  THEY DO IT ALL AND DO IT GREAT.                  AWESOME!!!!
B000A6T1JU|5.0|In New York City, the gangs of the streets have formed together one night at a ceremony, the leader Cyrus (Roger Hill) gets shot by a vicious gang called \\"The Rogues\\" led by Luthur (David Patrick Kelly) and they frame a good gang called \\"The Warriors\\" (Michael Beck, James Remar, David Harris, Brian Tyler, Dorsey Wright, Marcelino Sanchez, Thomas G. Waites, Terry Michos and Tom Mckitterneck). However, our heroes are running from the cops and other rival gangs such as \\"The Baseball Furies\\" for they must run to their turf at the other side of the city, try to clear their names and fight Luther's gang.<br /><br />Kickass action drama from director Walter Hill (\\"48 Hours\\") is one of the most unique and violent films from the 70's! the premise is very original with terrific action & battle scenes with good performances. The movie has went on to become one of the controversial movies ever cause of it's subject matter and causing some violence to be break out into theaters, it's grown to become a cult classic over the years since it was released and i can see why.<br /><br />This new Director's Cut DVD features an all-new version with a new narration, some comic book-esque framing at some points of the film and the ending, four featurettes, the original theatrical trailer and a deleted scene along with great picture and sound remastering.<br /><br />A must see movie if you want explosive action!
B000AY74OQ|5.0|This is one of the best animated adventures I've seen in a long time.  I can watch this movie again and again with my kids and laugh everytime.  The meaning of true friendship and \\"eventually\\" working as a team are what the kids learn most from the characters.  This is \\"must have\\" for every family's collection.  We've watched the DVD so many times, we need a new one!
B000AY807Q|5.0|This is the work of a crazy man who has never bothered about the sale of his music, someone who has composed music and sang songs the way he wants for over 40 years now. Only such a man can make music of this quality....music that fully absorbs him, and others. For example, Emmylous Harris covers her ears with hands each time she sings, \\"This old guitar\\", probably because she wants to cut herself off totally from the outside world. Similarly, another guy (I don't know his name) keeps his eyes shut all the while, for each of the songs. As far as I understand, some of those guys are really enjoying every moment, and are as much absorbed by the whole thing as Neil Young is. Songs such as \\"Painter\\" and \\"This old guitar\\" that will linger and continue to reverberate long after one is done listening to the CD.     It's a sad fact is there is no higher rating than 5 stars in Amazon, because that does not do justice to it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|A wonderful adaption of the novel to film. Saw this at the theater when it first came out and enjoyed the whole experience. Have read all the books and think that the movie was well done; not to mention the cast's great performances.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is still the best of the Superman movies to date.  While the special effects are dated and less than spectacular than he recent Superman Returns, it still exceeds as a superiorly directed, acted, and Superman presentation than any other version.<br /><br />This is not to say that the more recent movie, Superman Returns  or Superman II are not fine films, they are; but here Richard Donner, still a young director at the time, manages to flush out a superior performance from Christopher Reeve and Margret Kidder.  The proof is in their careers - both actors gave their best performances in this movie, while they were yet still unpolished performers.  Gene Hackman was great with a superb dry wit and great sense of timing.<br /><br />There are plenty of places to get a review of the plot so I'll skip it, but the sense of hope Superman brings to this film is great. He is America's Moses.  While the special effects don't quite make you belive a man can fly, you will get lost in the adventure and maybe be a better person for it.
B000AMJDHY|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I think the album is wonderful.  It is a great freshman attempt... but that is also the downside to the album.  It uses a lot of the same musical devices (the bass drum build-up, similar tempo throughout, similar melodic intervals, repeated power chords, etc), but all the songs are good, despite.  It just sounds like they found something that worked, and used it extensively.<br /><br />The lyrics are the big draw for me, especially in songs like \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines\\" and \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk.\\"<br /><br />I would reccommend this album for anyone that will give it at least three or four good listens before making judgements on whether or not it is appealing.
B000059XUI|4.0|This movie presents the deadly three rebels placed in the Phatom Zone, and Superman's battle against them, and his own personal angst to be loved by Lois Lane.  The movie falls compared to Donner's movie, but Lester is great at the physical comedy.  Margot Kidder and Reeve both give outstanding performances, while Gene Hackman in the few scenes he is in the movie, stills the show.<br /><br />The battle in Metropolis with the three villians is fun and entertaining, only dated by its outdated special effects.  The romance is handled well, but Singer's more recent version is better.  Superman is more like Sampson than Mosses, freely giving up his powers for a love (except Lois of course would never betray Superman), only to have cry out to his father to get them back to fight General Zod and his deadly sidekicks.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I must start my review by confessing to be a massive Rise Against fan. While you might think this means I would be automatically satisfied by this record, it is actually the reverse that applies. I was always going to be critical if it was average. <br />I bought this album with very high expectaions as 'Siren Song of the Counter Culture' and 'Revolutions Per Minute' are two of my favourite albums of all time. I half expected to be disappointed because so many bands recently have followed great albums with average ones. I'm happy to say though, Rise Against have once again delivered the goods. I cannot think of another band that has released three consecutive albums that have been as good as the the last three from 'Rise'. I must also say that while their earlier album, 'The Unravelling', is good, it is not in the league of the most recent three discs. <br />'The Sufferer and the Witness' starts off strong and finishes the same way. Every track is a highlight, and quite a few could be good singles. Having mentioned that, rest easy, the band hasn't sold out like so many do. They have stuck to their sound and without sounding repetitive. <br />Good on you Rise Against, another fantastic album that fans and newcomers alike will love!
0553804677|4.0|For a plot synopsis, please see the review below this one :-) <br /> <br />While I didn't find this to be the new frontier of fantasy novels that many people have made the book to be, I did find Lies of Locke Lamora to be entertaining and enjoyable.  Scott Lynch creates a world with his words- lush descriptions filled with simile and metaphor, well-constructed characters, and a somewhat tangled plot.  There are also several tantalizing hints at an unknown past that readers are not privy to but that, I hope, will make it into future offerings, if this is the first book of a series (for example, Locke's complex love life). <br /> <br />An example of Lynch's marvelous way with words:  \\"The voice was clipped and precise, scrubbed of Locke's natural inflections.  He layered the hint of a harsh Vadran accent atop a slight mangling of his native Camorri dialect like a barkeep mixing liquors.\\" <br /> <br />Clearly, Lynch knows how to write a simile.  The book is littered with such fine turns of phrase, and makes the entire read very enjoyable.  The dock of one star is because I thought the book took longer than necessary to get started.  But once I caught the rhythm of it, it kept my interest very easily. <br /> <br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is like joining the poetically vengeful nature of the Count of Monte Cristo with the good fun of Ocean's Eleven in a fantasy element.  And, as is his creation Locke Lamora, Lynch is as good a mixer as any barkeeper.  Recommended.
B00006G8G1|5.0|The Iron Maiden reunion and they don't disapoint.  This is a very very good show to an aweosme crowd (250 thousand people) people have disputed the setlist including the previous reviewer saying its missing alot of the classics and while it is missing the old classics, the new stuff is just as good, ghost of navigator, the wicker man, blood brothers and Brave new world are all classics in their own right and by the way you don't miss out on 2 mins to midnight or run to the hills, hallowed be thy name or number of the beast.  If your more a fan of the old classics then i would strongly reccommend the Live After Death dvd instead of Rock In Rio.  The only problem i have with Rock in Rio is that Janic Gers gets more solos than the great Adrian Smith.  Don't get me wrong Janic is a very good guitarist and deserves credit for his work in  Maiden, but Adrian Smith please he is one of the best and technically perfect guitarists ever. <br /> <br />Awesome act although not as good as Death On The Road.  Rock in Rio finds a happy medium between Live After Death and Death On The Road. <br /> <br />Bottom line, buy it now its a remarkable show by a remarkable band. Cheers. <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS
0767836324|5.0|Hook is such a great movie.  It also stays true with the originality of Pan. <br />-Clapping to bring Tinkerbell back to life <br />-The Lost Boys (the twins) <br />-Wendy wanting the \\"night lights\\" to protect the children <br />-The crocodile, and many more... <br />This was such a great concept to bring the modern audience and expose children to the idea of Peter Pan and his story.  The acting here is great and the entire film is a great experience.  It's good to know what happened when Peter grew up.
B00005OCMR|4.0|This movie has definately aged alot but i still like it as when i first saw it as a child.I dont know if i'd call it a kids movie just with its tone but i guess compared to what kind of movies are coming out today its pretty safe.The only kind of person i;d recomonend it to is someone who saw it as a kid and liked it.I think kids today would laugh at its graphics and if you didnt like it back when it came out you probably wouldnt now.
B0001HAISQ|4.0|I thought this was a great and more recent (w/ all of our new technology) version of the original Peter Pan.  I'm a big fan of the musical, the book, and everything about the boy who refused to grow up.  I'm also a big fan of \\"Hook\\".  I thought the special effects were great but in not giving the novel justice, I still felt it was missing aspects (this is why I didn't give it 5 stars). <br />-Tinkerbell didn't give her famous \\"silly a**\\" talk to Wendy <br />-Peter Pan didn't return to Jane at the end(only in the special features part of the DVD, an unfinished scene) <br />-Tikerbell came back to life from what the children were saying, not clapping <br /> <br />The acting was really good, and it still kept w/ Peter Pan tradition in having the same actor play Mr. Darling and Hook.  Great Movie!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I did not hear of Firefly until after the series was canceled.  If I had seen it during its run, I would have been an avid fan.  This is a fantastic show and I am very sorry that it was canceled. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it.  This is one of the best series I have seen.  Believable characters and great plots. <br /> <br />A must have for the collection.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|I bought this CD expecting it to be a bit boring, because I'm not a big fan of the song 'Ready To Fall', but I was pleasantly suprised.  Lyrically, it's powerful and meaningful.  They talk of politics, the negative aspects of religion, and just life in general like they usually do, and they do it greatly.  Now, this is not as good as 'Siren Songs' was, but it's definately almost as good.  'Drones' is probably the best song on here, speaking of how the media and religion tries to brainwash you into being something that you can't or shouldn't be.  'Bricks' is a pretty good song, too, protesting the war in Iraq and encouraging kids to rise against (no pun intended) our corrupt government system.  Lyrically, it's powerful and it's bound to be one of those songs where kids raise their fists in the air at concerts.  All of the other songs are great, too, like 'Chamber The Cartridge', a song about how we're slowly destroying this world.  All in all, it's just a great piece of punk rock music and I definately suggest that you people buy this.  If you like Rise Against, you're bound to like: <br /> <br />Bad Religion <br />Crass <br />Anti-Flag <br />Strike Anywhere <br />A Wilhelm Scream
0684824906|3.0|Yes, Goodwin had a good idea for a framework of her massive book: parallel biographies of the four men who vied for the Republican nomination in 1860 and who later served in Lincoln's cabinet. <br /> <br />And yes, she's very good on Lincoln's amazing skills as a politician and his utter lack of vanity or pettiness. <br /> <br />And yes, she's done a huge amount of research (at least, I think it's hers). <br /> <br />Still, something about this book nags at me.  It's not nearly as good as it should have been.  And it keeps annoying me. <br /> <br />Goodwin's prose style is serviceable, but no more than that.  There are plently of sentences that I had to reread and think about before I knew who all the pronouns referred to.  And she seems to think that \\"tantamount\\" means essential, and so on. <br /> <br />In her introduction, Goodwin praises her editor, which can mean either of two things, or both.  First, that the editor really was excellent.  Second, that the editor was too easy on the author. <br /> <br />Most troubling to me is a kind of fuzziness that Goodwin keeps allowing to creep in.  Here is an example.  It's September 22, 1862, and Lincoln is about to tell his cabinet that he has decided to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.  But first: <br /> <br />\\"Lincoln attempted to lighten the mood with a reading from the Maine humorist Charles Farrar Browne.  Seward alone readily appreciated the diversion, laughing uproariously along with Lincoln at the antics of Artemus Ward.\\"  (p. 481) <br /> <br />It sounds as if Artemus Ward is a fictional character of Browne's doesn't it?  But Ward was in fact Browne's pseudonym.   <br /> <br />Trivial?  Sure.   But mistakes like this are all over the book, and they bring me up short.  It feels at times as if Goodwin got confused, and at other times as if she was dumping the contents of various index cards into the appropriate paragraph without thinking hard about what her point was. <br /> <br />I find myself thinking about Gore Vidal's novel, Lincoln.  Vidal's take on Lincoln as politician is very, very similar to Goodwin's, and his command of the facts is strong.  But Vidal can really write, and every sentence, every paragraph, is clear and has a function in telling the story. <br /> <br />I wish we had the nonfiction book that combined Goodwin's research with Vidal's clarity of mind and pen.
0446530891|2.0|Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL<br /><br />and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN<br /><br />STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just<br /><br />heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller<br /><br />about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to<br /><br />solve two campaign-trail crimes . . .

B0002W18MU|5.0|For those of us that have followed Johnny Cash's career through the highs and lows, we get one more glimpse. This door opens into a man's soul having lost his life's light, and knowing his light is dimming. As only Johnny can do he relates the moment in his voice and lyrics as no other musician has for me. Rick Ruben helped craft this album with Johnny right up to the final polishing. This is just one more achievement for Johnny and a great memorial by Rick Ruben. Thanks, Rick!! I can't wait for American VI.
0805211063|5.0|I wonder why the term \\"Kafkian Complexity\\" has never been coined (to my knowledge that is)in this era where complexity and chaos are in vogue..<br /><br />I would suggest to read Systemantics by John Gall (see my review) as a complement to this dense (superb) novel.. I would suggest listening to some Mark Isham incidental music as a background too.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|While I was watching the movie, I absolutely loved the music so I just had to get the cd. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, hands down. I couldn't get the music out of my head. It stays with you! However, I have 2 gripes. The movie's about 2 1/2 hours long and the cd only has approximately 45 minutes worth of the music. They left out alot of really good stuff. My 2nd one is that the titles of the tracks don't fit the scenes in the movie. The tracks are not even in order but that doesn't matter. The order of the music seems to fit very nicely on the cd. Who knows? Maybe if enough fans voice their disappointment, they'll come out with a longer version. But don't let any of this sway you if you're thinking of getting the cd. By all means, this is a definite MUST BUY!!!

0743201140|1.0|I purchased this book at the suggestion of a co-worker who suggested that the strength assessment tool had really done a great job identifying his strengths and that as an organization, we would be well-served to have all our associates complete the exercise for the sake of their co-workers and managers.      I took the \\"test\\" and only found that 2 of the strengths identified appeared to apply to me.  I was willing to acknowledge that I wasn't as \\"self-aware\\" as other people and purchased the books for the rest our our department.  The results appeared to as thought the strengths were identified by random (i.e., if there are 6-7 types of personalities, you'd expect 1-3 traits to apply if they were applied by random).    This was a disappointing book and I would recommend that managers stick to more traditional personality and temperment assessment tools.

0739308726|5.0|A continuation of the series by George RR Martin.  Each chapter is from a different person's perspective.  The characters are fascinating and complex, as are the plot lines. I don't generally read scifi/fantasy, but I have really enjoyed this series and can't wait for the next book to come out.  Everyone else I know who has picked up the first book in the series has become a huge fan as well.  I would only recommend this series for adult readers however, as there are intense and violent parts.
B00005JP4W|5.0|What a powerful piece of work that does move far beyond political lines. This is about our planet, and Al Gore does all of his homework. Be prepared to learn more than you were expecting, and be moved to take action. You will want to see this, show your friends this, and your family this....it IS a must see!
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I saw this movie on cable and was inspired. I'm glad quality copies are now available for purchase. This is a film I've watched again and again and shared with others because of the strength, courage, and compassion of Karol Wojtyla.
B000002G0P|5.0|Great Album from start to finish, however, the track \\"DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE\\" does not appear on the CD as it does on the cassette. \\"Warheads\\" is a tough song to figure out if you're a guitar player, nevertheles, I'll be practicing my butt off on that one. \\"Rest in Peace\\" is a masterpiece itself, followed by the funky cut \\"Politicalamity\\", Nuno Bettencort pulled some Hendrix riffs on a lot of these tracks like \\"Cupid's Dead\\" (the Non-Horn version), and Peace Maker Die, the one that touched me the most because they dedicated that to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Overall great album but I still would like to have that missing track on there.
B000FGGE68|4.0|Ultraviolet is a movie that has gotten short shrift, almost certainly due to an overemphasis on the movie's cgi.  The other elements of Ultraviolet are all quite good, and deserve more credit. <br /> <br />First of all, Milla Jovovich gives one of her best performances in this movie.  She looks absolutely great, and her physicality is better than ever.  She is nuanced in showing both sides of her character:  a hardened killing machine, and a caring, loving (surrogate) mother.  Second, Ultraviolet's story is much better than average, engaging and unpredictable.   <br /> <br />All that said, Ultraviolet fails in a core element, its pure cgi sequences.  Ultraviolet's world is reasonably interesting, and there are a number of good sets provided in the movie.  Most of the movie looks good to great.  But the director and producers tried something new with the cgi, and here they failed miserably.  This becomes particularly gruesome with pure cgi sequences.  A motorcycle chase sequence early in the movie, for example, just looks terrible (think minor update of Disney's terrible Tron).   <br /> <br />Even so, Ultraviolet has a lot to offer, and is worth watching. 3.5 stars
0553801503|2.0|I just have to get this off my chest: this book is tedious. Yes, I'm among the legions who read the first three Fire and Ice books and kept checking Martin's website for news of the fourth. Like many, I preordered. Before I had a chance to start reading, I saw the bad reviews start pouring out, so I delayed reading A Feast for Crows, fearing Robert Jordan syndrome. When I finally started reading, my worst fears were realized, and I've felt pure disappointment. As many others have said here, too many characters, too little plot advancement.  <br /> <br />Every night I read one chapter, hoping that something will happen. Every night I count the pages till the end, and it seems interminable. You can see Martin's world expanding but with no purpose. Martin seems to be writing for himself, fogetting his readers. All that talent wasted on noodling his navel. Time to find the next series.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|Nanny McPhee is a very good children's movie.  Colin Firth plays the hapless Mr. Brown, a recent widower with seven children that must marry soon or lose the support of his Aunt Adelaide.  Mr. Brown is so distraught by the recent loss of his wife and his ensuing financial troubles that he has been ignoring his children.  They, being smart and willful, have become terrors.  All very \\"done before\\" and predictable.  But the story is quite well done, and is particularly spot-on with Nanny McPhee's \\"education\\" of the children.      The movie has a very good supporting cast, lead by Celia Imrie as the humorously awful stepmother-to-be, and Angela Lansbury, really fantastic as the terrible Aunt.  Unfortunately, Firth as Mr. Brown is so clueless as to be hard to watch.      Emma Thompson is very good as Nanny McPhee, a character that by intention starts a bit off-putting, but becomes quite endearing.  Even so, I found the makeup to be overdone.  Physical appearance shouldn't be so important to a movie (or life in general), but this key element of the movie would have been better done with more subtlety.    Otherwise Nanny McPhee is funny and endearing, in a likely child-pleasing predictable way.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|there are about 9 amazing songs on here, 7-12 are insane. So good, had real high expectations and this cd exceeded them. A classic
B0002DB0FO|4.0|It was great to be able to watch all the episodes of season one all over again, it's been a long time since I was able to watch them all. The extras are also very interesting, including the \\"Greg and Emily Cam\\" which showed that the cast/crew got along well off the set as well. The packaging is very nice, and it's great to have all the episodes from the first season in a nice collection. Here's hoping to more DVD sets from this series!
B000E6GBV2|1.0|Despite some evident talent, this Band of Horses never gets out of the paddock.  Probably one of the most strangled sounding CDs I've ever heard, the fish bowl vocals constantly fight with the rhythm guitars, but neither ever manage to break out: the vocals failing to produce a shred of emotion (or clarity) and the guitars always a couple of steps from a melody.  With the exception of perhaps one or two numbers, each track stays in exactly the same mid-range making for a truly dull and repititious listening experience. <br /> <br />As noted by others on this board, BOH does indeed sound like a My Morning Jacket (recorded in a silo) knockoff, albeit without the passion, lead guitar, or lengthy takes.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, I'd rather listen to Neil sing \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" for the 4,876,386th time.
B00005JOQS|3.0|And so the Superman franchise is given another lease once more just right after Supe's WORLD'S FINEST buddy Bats gets the same treatment of the movie productions incorporated for DC Comics, in its attempt to revamp their characters back in the action of the celluloid biz, that according to this flick - Supes's been cited in Manila at 10:15.    Thus, with the red-caped crusader's continued crusade for truth, justice, and the american way is further portrayed on screen-- just got home from watching the flick myself on IMAX at the  Philippines' first cinema with the said 3D enhancers this fourth of July that's now recognized as the Filippine-American Friendship Day, that I happen to meet one of the country's legendary bands JUAN DELA CRUZ' half-american/Pilipinoe member Joey \\"Pepe\\" Smith quite incidentally after the flick around the area, who've thirty years ago opened for the BEATLES' infamous visit on the country. Hm, kinda like some synchronicities it seem. And yep, got eyed by a real pretty american chick as well along the way...    Now, before I talk about the whole IMAX thing, first about the movie itself: not to put a level of high expectation, I was ready to say that it's a good rendition of revamping the SUPERMAN mythos, and the IMAX effects gave it a spectacular touch -- but eventually with the SUPES plotline having been rebuffed quite one too many times now to the point of overkill mainly with the romantic innuendo's done about between LOIS LANE and CLARK KENT, one can't help but cite a lot of predictability going on with the storyline's twist and turns, and thus its not a-web swingin'.   And also along the lines with this- the ghost from the SALKIND production movie series have haunted this one at the most, which not only have the score of John Williams from the previous movies re-used within the movie itself (in spite that its musical score provided by John Ottman are on level as some splendid successor to soar in this Superman flick) - it also used segments of Marlon Brando from the first SALKIND production flick (which featured SUPERTRAMP's song \\"Give A Little Bit\\" playing on the car of Lois Lane at one scene) wherein he plays Supes' dad Jor-El, and a lot of plot elements from the previous films as well, that thus makes the movie a sequel that's not really necessarily a sequel of sorts to the SALKIND Superman flicks, and it also includes a plotline that had a lot to deal with the second installment from those movies, the sequel SUPERMAN II - which in the result cracks a very big whole in its plot - being that Supes is taken away of his Superbeing (ie. Powers) when he cracked the arse of Lois Lane at that time (you'd get the idea about this matter once you've seen the flick, no pun intended) - which in that respect only characterizes the kind of a typical american fictionary stuff, whenever.    AS FOR the IMAX treatment = it actually only go for four scenes within the flick, being that the movie is not really intendedly made for an IMAX movie fare, they've only enhanced selected parts of the flick for the 3D enhanced segment portions.   That to speak of, the whole innovation from the traditional 3D effect that IMAX came up with is nothing new - 'twas innovated at first with the View Master toyline of disc reels implemented by the company called GAF back in the late 60's and the 70's -- and then tis made possible with movies, by the likes of JAWS 3D, wherein glasses for the 3D movie don't have to be consistedly required of a half red lense while the other lense's green, but a grey one that gives a sturdy condition for the 3D moving pictures' quality in comprising the 3D movie as a whole.     But being that the company who came up with the 3Dimentional movie effect is a small one, they gladly sold the rights as incorporated upon syndication to IMAX - who added the touch of an 8-story screen, plus surround sound enhancements, and now they bill it with bigger packaging if not the budget for selling it to the masses. However, the trailers shown for those that are made by the IMAX movie group are quite pretty neat - they are impressive. Most impressively the one titled TYRANOUSSOROUS REX -- ooh, i'd like ta give her a grab a-hold.    Anyhow, for the cast and crew: director Bryan Singer did the story for the flick, along with Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, who both did the screenplay. This time executively produced by a certain Chris Lee among others - it featured Frank Langella as Perry White (who coincidentally just lately starred on the flick called 10.5 APOCALYPSE that was featured on the boob tube, with the shape of America in its storyline turned much too peculiarly similar with the way Lex Luthor in this flick (which is here portrayed by Kevin Spacey, who did a na-bad performance of the character/arch-nemesis of Supes, next to his predecessor Gene Hackman) envisioned it to become), and a host of others that are none-too notable at all.    Another glitch in the storyline that makes this movie hard to squeeze in as a real part of the previous Superman flicks, is that Clark's mom Martha is still living, when she's reportedly already gone dead in SUPERMAN 3!    And in closing as for the guy who played the red-caped crime fighter this time, Brandon Routh- nyeah, he may have the affiliation to cut himself as a real ticket for being the next dip hearthrob, but in this flick he is more often unnatural to fit the bill of the main Supes-character, that with computer jitz-effects paving the way to enhance him itself - it's all so well forced. It looks so artificial so much so with the flying effects, that it depended not to use strings that much for the effects' sequences but on inanely boring computer fx which only makes it lose its magic even more.   I say, given under that projection, might as well watch the classic Supes cartoon of Max & David Fleischer, who's series about are conveniently now available on video or DVD.     For the role of the superduper caped crusader, nobody else tops the bill quite obviously as in the case of Robert Powell playing the role of Christ on Franco Zeffirelli's JESUS OF NAZARETH flick - that for this case no ones fits perfectly to play Superman but no other than the late actor himself, Mr. Christopher Reeve.    crutchead's ratings =  IMAX enhancements: 7 out of 10  Movie: 2 1/2 out of 5 notches  sound effects: 3. 10 on the Richter scale  overall rating: 6 burritoes + one onion    music's not bad, though really.      THIS IS review #123 btw, for these here your friendly online convenient store AMAZON.Com, -- oops! 'Nuf of those lines -Spidey might have our hides.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The DVD is better than the VHS Tape which I also own.  The DVD Bonus features are worth taking a look at, as they give you a good look behind the scenes in regard to the making of the \\"The Phantom Menace\\".  This would be a great addition to a Star Wars Fan's Collection.  \\"May the Force Be With You\\" -- Xwing11 aka Jeb P. Brown
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Before my wife and I sat down to watch this version of Persuasion, by Jane Austen, I read the storyline, out loud, from the back of the DVD case.  It was a good thing I did, because without doing that there would have been no way to discover what was going on or where the plot would lead.   <br /> <br />In short, the hero of the story returns to find the woman who'd refused to marry him several years before still unmarried and with few prospects.  After some awkward encounters they're thrown back together and the spark returns to their relationship.  Apparently, this is not far-removed from Jane Austen's own life story and maybe why she was able to write about it so well.  Jane never married but her heroine in this story does and may go on to live happily ever after, last time we see them aboard his ship. <br /> <br />This DVD is worth having and re-viewing, but buyers shouldn't expect a \\"Pride & Prejudice,\\" or even an \\"Emma.\\"  Whoever did the film editing removed about 30 to 45 minutes more than they should have to make a complete story.  Acting, scenery, and character diversity are fine.  But we expected more of a novel, vs. a short story.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I am somewhat of a new Wilco fan. This is the first album I heard from Wilco and it took 5 listens to really apreciate it.  I watched a movie about the making of this album and I fell in love with Jeff Tweeny.  His voice is truley unique. Some songs that really got to me on this album were Radio Cure and Reservations.  I think 'reservations' is one of the best closers of an album I have heard in a very long time.  The reason I did not give this album 5 stars was because not all the songs were brilliant.  'War on War' has some cheesy lyrics and is probly a political song and same with 'Ashes of American Flags.' Some of Tweenys lyrics though are amazing and I really enjoy his work.  Overall this was a great album and it's a must have for any Wilco fan.
B000244FDW|5.0|My wife and I saw this 1979 (Elizabeth Garvie) version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in the early-1980's.  It was shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre--before we owned a VCR.  Five years later, we bought the VHS tape for $60, and were very happy to have it. Now here comes the DVD version with 39 extra minutes of valuable scenes that were not included in the VHS tape.  What a bargain this is! <br /> <br />This version of the story is rather different from the 1995 Colin Firth series in that so much of it is done from Elizabeth's point of view.  She provides insights and commentary all along the way, some of which are mistaken.  If forced to choose, we'd tend to prefer the Colin Firth version, especially with him cast as Mr. Darcy.  Also, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are played more whimsically and are more sympathetic characters in the 1995 edition.  Nevertheless, there is a lot to like in the 1979 version and would recommend that people buy both and compare. <br /> <br />Lesser characters like Mr. and Mrs. Collins, the other Bennett sisters, Lady Catherine, and the Bingleys make for a study in contrast, 1979 vs. 1995.  Both versions are enjoyable for what they show of human nature.  Moreover, the natural scenery and background music in both productions are just outstanding. <br /> <br />As to faithfulness to Jane Austen's book, both versions offer departures that are not necessarily bad.  Toward the end, where Lady Catherine confronts Elizabeth about her possible attachment to Darcy, the Colin Firth version really is closer to the book. (The scene is supposed to take place outside in Bennetts' side garden, not indoors. Nevertheless, Judy Parfitt plays Lady Catherine memorably in the 1979 version).  In some other areas, though, the 1979 version is more faithful to the author.  There was no double wedding at the end of the book, yet there is at the end of the Colin Firth version. <br /> <br />One disappointing feature of this Elizabeth Garvie DVD is the absence of any Special Features or \\"making of\\" piece. Ms. Garvie is still very much alive and it would have been interesting to get her comments on either or both productions. (There's quite a good \\"making of\\" feature with the latest Colin Firth edition and a still better one expected this fall). This aspect notwithstanding, both DVD are must-have's for P&P fans.
B000EHSVQE|4.0|This is a movie you will definately have to watch twice... If you have heard nothing about it and just randomly watch it you will think what the??? But try not to watch the movie to follow a particular storyline, just sit back and enjoy the daily adventures of Napoleon and friends. Awesomely funny movie.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part <br />with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the <br />main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has <br />been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie <br />has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does <br />make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are <br />trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being <br />told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie <br />like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence <br />there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece <br />compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the <br />very best. <br /> <br />For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie one star. <br />If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in the negative numbers <br />
0385513755|5.0|while so much controversy surrounds this book, the illustrated version is the one to read. I found it to be enlightening, positive and filled with interesting historical perspectives. I enjoyed being able to read and easily see what is being referenced in pictures right there without having to go look it up. you will too!!<br /><br />Get this book!! enjoy enriching your mind.
0340838035|5.0|I started reading this, courtesy of my wife, recovering from knee surgery and put it down due to depressing topic. Knowing I can never put a JP book down I picked it back up once I got mobile, and was swept up in Jodi's ability to weave a yarn. Topic I am certain hits home to many with children, or those who have had suicide in any form hit close to home. Excellent research behind the topic, excellent stroytelling, another Must Read from the Queen of New England literature. Bravo JP!
B00005J6T1|4.0|When this album hit the scene, \\"new wave\\" was getting old and there were so many gimmicks to the Top 40 groups (mostly British) that the fresh American face of Madonna with her totally unique style of clothes and good ole fashioned dance/pop tracks was just what a teenager like myself needed. It may seem mild today, especially considering Madonna's subsequent antics since then, but in the early 80's \\"Burning Up\\" was racy and ribald; just the kind of thing teenagers LOVE. <br />The 12'inch of \\"Lucky Star\\" was a valued posession of every teen  with any coolness. All the drag queens at the bars I could almost never get in but would loiter outside of, were forever performing \\"Holiday\\", But it was when the \\"Borderline\\" video came out that the essence of Madonna's beauty, style, sex appeal and strength really shone through and made us forever hail her as the \\"Queen\\". Although some of the songs on this album are a bit simple and cutesy, it's a must have for all Madonna fans. This is where it all started!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Rent is one of the best movies ever. There is nothing bad about it. It does talk about real issues in the world today and the music/songs in it are unbelievable. And when I remember that one person wrote the play and all it's songs, I get bloww away.
B00005JOQS|3.0|This movie looks great. Beautiful cinematography and the special effects were amazing. But what's up with the rest of it? It's pretty obvious that Brandon Routh can't act. Bryan Singer barely gave him any lines at all and when he did speak, it was wooden. Brandon most likely got the part because he looked the part. But it probably would have been wiser to go with someone who can act. The storyline is just terrible. If and when there is a next one, it should start out with Superman waking up and everything that happened in this movie was all just a dream. He should not have a son. People don't want to see Superman as a daddy. And the kid has absolutely no purpose in this film. Other than throwing a piano. And Lois Lane's boyfriend is a drag. Lex Luthor is handled very poorly. He somehow figures out a way to raise an island from out of the ocean which will then flood much of the world and kill \\"billions.\\" Well...the island does come up out of the water but nobody is flooded at all. There's one little wave and that's it. If you want to see a good, 3 dimensional villain, just look at Ian McKellen's Magneto in the X-Men films. Bryan Singer did a much better job with those movies than he did with Superman.
B00027JYLC|5.0|In the era of Bella Lagosi and Lon Chaney  with all the make up and horror  Tod Browning takes a shot at a movie using real life freaks and side show actors.  I think the public was not ready for that kind of viewing so it was shunned for many years....until now.  the movies plot is nothing spectacular but remember this is early film and they were still experimenting.  the show has to do with circus performers behind the scenes socially, the freaks stick together to retaliate against a kiniving acrobatist and strong man who try to take advantage of a rich dwarf who is smitten by the beautiful acrobat.  the Freaks prevail.    I heard of this movie finding out that the Ramones were really big on this movie as far as certain topics go such as Pinheads and such their anthem was \\"gabba gabba hey, gabba gabba we aceppt you one of us\\"    I gave this show 5 stars based on the viewing of the freaks and the whole concept of trying something that has never been done and still hasn't.    I give the movie and its plot  3 stars but it is early cinema
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was drawn to the idea of a North and South in English history reflecting vast differences in culture much in the way that the North and South in American history does.  Of course during the industrial revolution, this was obviously the case in industrial nations around the world.  In this story the society, poverty and pain was so graciously understated yet vividly represented in the characters.  I would heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical novels dramatized.  My only complaint was that BBC America chose to include lengthy advertisements of their TV channel on each disc, but thankfully the FF button remedied that after the first viewing.
031286504X|4.0|I first ordered I Am Legend because I read that it was going to be turned into a movie, but now that I've read it I'm dreading the big screen version because I know that it won't do the book justice.  Without giving anything away let me just say that the book has a less than happy ending which adds to the story, but the movie makers will probably change for the adaptation.  When I heard that Will Smith is going to be in the motion picture, I cringed.  When have you ever seen a Will Smith movie that didn't have a happy ending? Hollywood is going to turn this book into Blade IV:Sucking Hard.<br /><br /> The book is about Robert Neville, who is seemingly the last human man on Earth.  The story delves in detail into the meticulous preparations into which Neville goes to fend off the vampires.  During the day he can travel freely outside and stake the undead while they slumber, but at night he is at the mercy of the bloodsucking horde and must stay locked in his house.  The book also invetigates what started the vampirism in the first place and Neville's quest to find a cure which is fascinating and probably could have been a book in its own right. For some unknown reason Neville himself is immune to the vampirism so if he gets scratched or bitten he doesn't have to worry about being turned, but he can still die. Neville is desperate for companionship and finally encounters a young seemingly human woman that walks around in the daylight.  Bringing her into his home he is leery at first and then begins to trust her.  This leads to a conclusion fitting of a Legend.  Highly Recommended.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Excellent movie!  Having watched the TV series as a child, it was refreshing to see the story done in today's setting with the different techological elements of our lives woven into the story.  Of course that is not unique in itself but the results were stimulating and exciting to behold.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|If you wanted the Peppers to stay the same, you will be disappointed again.  Anyone who knows the music of this quartet has to acknowledge the consistent growth on Every Pepper Record (with the possible exception of the Dave Navarro experiment 'One Hot Minute'), consistent evolution is the common theme - and you know that the Peppers 'Can't Stop'.<br /><br />If you think you might like this record - Buy It!!!<br /><br />The first listen through I thought, \\"O.K., good stuff here and there - some ripping Guitar solos of course.\\" But after a fourth and fifth listening to THE ENTIRE RECORD, I started hearing stuff way down in the mix,very imaginative synth play, balls to the walls and catchy as hell chord progressions, delicate zen like numbers as well as psychodelic grooves and GREAT LYRICS (personally I think Anthony has reached a place in his lyric writing very few rock artist ever attain - open ended and yet very accesable.

B0002W18MU|3.0|\\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" is similar to its four predecessors in that it has Rick Ruben's typical handling of Cash in a bare bones, folksy setting. Usually, it's just Johnny and his guitar. This release is a break from its forerunners when it comes to quality control. The contemporary covers just aren't as compelling or recognizable as Johnny doing Beck's 'Rowboat' or Geoff Mack's 'I've Been Everywhere.' The traditional material is also softer as 'God's Gonna Cut You Down' just can't compare to Solitary Man's 'Wayfaring Stranger.' The original material is also less substantial as a tune like 'I Came To Believe' doesn't measure up to 'Country Boy' as played on \\"Unchained.\\" It's no coincidence that this disc was posthumously released; it's unlikely that Johnny Cash would have approved. While there's a quality control issue, there's also no bad music here. Johnny's voice sounds good, especially considering his physical condition. 'Love's Been Good to Me' is the highlight among otherwise decent songs. The issue here is that the songs don't meet the high standard that the previous American recordings set. These songs would have been a welcome addition to \\"Unearthed\\" or a similar release of music worth hearing but not strong enough to wear a Roman numeral. Unable to give Johnny anything less than five stars, the zealots will vote this review down but the listener should appreciate shades of gray. \\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" is worth having, but make it the final disc in your American collection.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Let me begin by saying I have seen alot of \\"teen sex comedies\\" and none of them compare to \\"The Girl Next Door\\". Everything from the music/score, the direction, and the casting is really perfect. I assume you have read other reviews on this site for it so I'll just say that this film has miles of heart, great comedy, and is really worth your money. And seeing as how I truly love movies I wouldn't want you to waste yours on a bad one. Chris Marquette (Freddy Vs. Jason, Just Friends) and Timothy Olyphant (A Man Apart, Dreamcatcher, Go) are absolutely hilarious in this film. If comedies are your thing, you shouldn't leave this one out.
B00005M989|4.0|Great old school Prince...all of the best with very few that you haven't heard.  This is a great blast from the past!!!
B0002W18MU|5.0|'American V' is NOT the last installment of the series (despite it having the last song Cash ever wrote). Rick Rubin still has around 60 songs left in the vaults and is about halfway through producing 'American VI'.  <br /> <br />Anyway, it'd be impossible for anyone with a soul to not buy and love this record.
B00005JKES|5.0|Considering the vast amount of TV and film garbage happily making its way out onto DVD, its scandalous that those who currently own the rights to something of the genuine quality of Twin Peaks don't let the public see it. Years have gone by since I purchased this fragment of the original program and yet still no word on the release of the rest of the shows. <br /> <br />Whoever the current owners are - show it, or sell it because we want to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

068987474X|4.0|My best friend had just broken up with her boyfriend of fours years and was having terrible luck dating. She gave me this book. I thought it was a bit too cheesy for me, but my friend absolutely swore by it. Eventually she convinced me to read it. It turned out to be very funny and upbeat. This book opens yours eyes to what guys are really thinking. The best advice here is that if you find out the person you are dating \\"just isn't that into you\\", it's not time for a pity party! You can decide to make yourself a happier and more confident person. Besides this book, my friend and I tried services like Agogus.com to beef up our conversational skills. We end up having more fun no matter who we are with since now we are more interesting and self-confident. So even if the guy isn't into you, don't take it personally. Focus on self-improvement and get into you!
B000EYK4GW|4.0|Dumbo is a classic Disney film, one which is iconic in its imagery of the pink elephants and the poor little elephant with too large ears to fit into the elephant society. This is a very sad and bittersweet movie as Dumbo is removed from his mother who pines away for her lost son. Dumbo has to find his own identity and find a way to not get picked on all the time.<br /><br />Originally released in 1941, Dumbo is a short 63 minutes in duration. The special features on the Big Top Edition more than outweigh the feature itself. There is a game that teaches children about circus animals, a storybook, two sing a longs, a music video, several Disney shorts. Outside of the commentary track and the shorts, little here is of value or interest to the adult. The real issue with this new \\"Big Top\\" Edition is that it is not significantly different than the \\"60th Anniversary Edition\\". There is a different music video, the addition of a feature and the loss of others. The film quality itself is not dramatically different than the previous version.<br /><br />Honestly, Dumbo is a Disney film worth owning. But it makes no difference which edition one purchases.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry
B0007TKNL0|5.0|You heard me. This film is great! This has got to be the best Phantom Of The Opera ever. Andrew Lloyd Weber was a musical genius and Joel Schumacher is a great director (he redeemed himself after the disaster of the Batman films 3 & 4 with this movie). This is one of the best musical movies ever made. Anyone who is interested in the classic story of The Phantom Of The Opera should check out this masterpiece.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|i think that this season was the best season ever. things really started to changes for everyone. but i think that it was time for a change. and i am glad that i had got it when it was at a low price at the time. i can not wait until season 6 comes on dvd. i hope that it will not go off the air any time soon. GREAT SEASON EVER.

0895260131|5.0|This book is a huge wake-up call.  Disinformation from the political correctness crowd, the media, our own government, and the apologists for Islam keeps people thinking all Muslims pretty much like us, except for a few extremists.  But, this book will clear up any confusion you may have about how a religion of peace can produce jihadists who  behead anyone who does not convert to Islam or willingly pay a humiliating tax.  Buy this book.  Read it.  Talk about it with people you know.  Bin Laden put the USA on notice in 2002 that America either needs to embrace Islam or suffer the consequences.  As far as he and millions of other Muslims are concerned, any means possible, no matter how violent, is justified to replace the Constitution of the United States with the sharia. As an added benefit of this book, you will also learn why The Crusades were really fought and why you should not apologize for them.

If you have ever considered expanding your musical knowlegde no-matter what type of music you are currently listening to, you have to got to get this one, It is simply the best that's ever been done,,ever,,,,....
B000301YY8|5.0|Just recently heard about this artist, bought the cd and am loving it. I've played the cd over and over. Not only does James have an excellent singing voice. He's a great lyricist and a multifaceted musician.  I'm looking forward to more from this talented artist. <br />
0790731509|5.0|Released in '69, 'Cool Hand Luke' is in my opinion Paul Newman's signature film and one of the great classic films of all-time. Everything worked together perfectly in this movie; A marvelous directing job by Stuart Rosenberg, terrific contemporary soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin and and ensemble cast to die for. There are so many well known faces in this film and so many great, quotable lines you'll never forget.<br /><br />Newman plays the recently incarcerated Luke. Assigned to a chain gang to serve out a relatively short sentence for cutting the heads off parking meters, his non conformist ways earn the respect of the other inmates and the hatred of the guards and captain.<br /><br />What makes 'Cool Hand Luke' so memorable is the fact that it's a story within a story. On the one hand you have a mundane prison tale of a group of societal misfits serving time for their various indisgressions. However on a deeper level you have a Messianic parody with Luke as the Christ. As the inmates embrace him as their \\"Chosen One\\" the guards seek to destroy him for disturbing the established order. A great film on so many levels. For those who like to read into the story, or for those who are just looking for a little entertainment.<br /><br />George Kennedy received a well deserved Oscar for his supporting role, but it really should have won many more. Newman is magnificent and Martin Strother once again proves himself to be one of the greatest character actors of his generation. A near perfect film.<br /><br />One of the Essentials!
B000F7CMRM|1.0|One of the worst movies I have seen for a long time.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I love-love-love the BBC miniseries P & P.  I could not wait for the new P & P to come out in theatres.  When it did, I was surprised to find that I love-love-love the new P & P as well.  I had people ask \\"Which do you like better?\\" and I could not answer because I loved both so much.  I recently ordered the new P & P on DVD and watched it back-to-back with the BBC miniseries to see if there was ANY way to determine if I had a preference.  In the end, I decided that I do like the BBC one a teeny-tiny bit more because I enjoy how much more exaggerated the characters are.  In the BBC version, Mrs. Bennett is more of an annoying drama queen and Mr. Collins is more repulsive (nearly impossible to imagine that \\"old maid\\" Charlotte would consent to marrying him - ugggh!).  In the new P & P, it seems more believable that Elizabeth would \\"come around\\" to Mr. Darcy because he is less \\"standoffish\\" than Colin Firth's character in the BBC version.  I enjoyed Keira Knightly in the new version but there was something about what I call Jennifer Ehle's \\"secret amused smile\\" in the BBC version that I feel really helps define Elizabeth's character.  All in all, if you're a P & P fan - you should own both.  If you are a person pressed for time - watch the shorter (new) version and if you have the time - watch the miniseries!  Above all - enjoy!
1419359827|5.0|I've been a \\"networker/relationship person\\" for my entire career, but still received many exceptional pointers from this book.  Enjoyed Keith's points about writing articles (and how easy it is to connect with journalists), emphasis on \\"health, wealth, and children\\", \\"not keeping score\\", and \\"birthday cards over holiday cards.\\" <br /> <br />Two days after I finished NEA, I contacted the author with a few comments, and he actually took the time to e-mail me back.  He actually responded with some advice to a business situation I presented to him.  He had no reason to even respond to me, as it would be improbable that I could help him--but he responded anyway! <br /> <br />Never Eat Alone is indeed a \\"look back and reflection\\" on all he's accomplished in his still-young life via his relationships with people, and advice to all of us, regardless of where we start out in life. Keith Ferrazzi gives credence to the saying, \\"Success is a journey, not a destination.\\" <br /> <br />His book is well worth the investment.  It's a great one!  <br />
0792843584|1.0|The American Humane Association, which is the source of the familiar disclaimer \\"No animals were harmed...\\" (the registered trademark of the AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me. I suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making, but I can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken!
B00004RJEG|5.0|A must have in your concert library!  This is a fantastic live performance by The Corrs.  The sound is crisp and clear.  This is easily the best The Corrs have ever sounded on a DVD.  However, more importanly, the concert was masterfully filmed.  Unlike their other concerts on DVD, this was filmed by professionals.  It is intimate, varied and visually refreshing.
0786915749|5.0|I'm a reader of many books, but I must say Dragonlance is my favorite series yet. I just finnished the War of Souls series. My love for the charectors, world, the plot, has carried me this far in the series. But I find myself looking back to this first book. I really dont have anything much to say exept: READ IT! KEEP READING IT! DONT STOP! The series is amazing, and youll never tire of it. One more thing...back off ladies, Raistlin is MINE!
B000002HPT|4.0|I was into this album when it first came out, but then it was largely forgotten and mostly thought of as \\"the least popular DT album\\", except that this is my mom's favorite (less instrumental tangents, she doesn't like them). I've been listening to it again recently and it definately deserves a listen. What I've heard (and I could be wrong) is that their label wanted them to make a \\"lighter\\" album. Labels- will they ever learn? Were any music masterpieces the result of label interference??  <br />I really like the sound effects (I don't know what the musical term is)that start out \\"New Millennium\\", as well as that whole song. \\"You Not Me\\" is one I have always liked, whether it's more \\"pop\\" or not, it's about selfish people, and I know plenty of them. \\"Peruvian Skies\\" is great, starts out slow and haunting and I really like when they sing the heavy part. I used to not be into \\"Hollow Years\\" but I've started to appreciate it more- that chorus has lyrics that are downright cheery, but in a cool way- although the pitch raise is a turnoff b/c Whitney Houston does pitch raises! \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" is an instrumental that sounds more heavenly- this song woke me up one day and I realized how powerful and positive it is- this might be my favorite on this album. \\"Just Let Me Breathe\\" is kind of a rant, but I kind of like it, it's the result of living through a decade of bands that try to suck. I also like the last song on the album. I used to like \\"Take Away My Pain\\" but now I think it sounds kind of like it should be on a feelgood movie soundtrack. Back in the day I also thought this album had too much Christianity in it, but now I don't care, and anyway they did do an album on reincarnation after that.  <br />One thing I really like is the ambient, new-agey sound effects at the beginnings of a lot of the songs. They effect the whole mood of the album. This album is not as bad as everyone says and there are quite a few great songs on it. One thing I like about DT is that whatever they do- depressing songs, inspirational songs, pop songs- they do it well, and they are not confined to always having to sound heavy. And another thing I really like about DT- one album is not an indication of the band going in a certain direction. I was wondering whether to buy their next album, but then it turned out to be Scenes From A Memory, which is the greatest ever!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|winner of the best picture award in 1996, the english patient plays out like a beautifully told song. with rich cinamatography, suberp acting, and a timeless love story it has the makings of a bona-fid classic. the story tells of a WW2 nurse (an oscar winning role for juliette binoche) who takes care of a pilot that was burned to a crisp in a horrible accident. he is known only as the english patient. as she tends to his wounds in a old church, the patient recalls his life when he lived in northern africa were he fell in love with a married woman. meanwhile, the nurse also has a growing affection for a soldier who de-fusses bombs (naveen andrews before lost). the rest of the movie switches from the patienst flashbacks to the modern time in the villa. williem dafoe steals the show as carvaggio, the thumbless man. ralph fiennes brings his best performance since shindler's list and kristin scott thomas also gives a fine role as the lover of the patient but like said before, it is juliete binoche who gives the best performence. i dont know why but just seeing her on the screen it almost appears as if she lights up everything which is truley amazing. a truley great film, by the end you may well up a bit but thats natural. so give in to the beauty that is the english patient.
B000099T2L|1.0|Ill start it off like this! I can make better music by bashing my head against a toilet seat! You XXXL ghetto gangsta kids wouldnt know real music if it bit you in the a**! In fact probably the only reason any of you even like her is because \\"ooooh shez soo fyne!!!\\" Yeah she may be fine but what do I know I am just a white boy! You guys can call me a \\"hatah\\" all you want! Go ahead I dont care. The thing is this overrated cow doesnt write her own lyrics and she doesnt play her own instruments! All her beats and etc are computer generated! I dont think she just broke out a Casio keyboard and a beatbox one day and just started playing music. <br /> <br />And you know what I think is a real shame? That all all these overrated rap and RnB musicans are all millionaires kicking it in Beverly Hills or wherever while all the true musicians (all the rock bands and etc. which play their own music) are all at the bottom. 50 cent and Beyonce and etc. shouldnt be Millionaires with mansions in Beverly Hills and driving Rolls Royces. The true musicians that play their own music and write their own lyrics deserve it more! Another thing. Sooner or later Beyonce will cease to be famous and she will wind up back in the ghetto where she belongs and puting her so called talent where it belongs. Working at McDonalds! <br /> <br />Also what I think is shameful is that Miss Beyonce here has completely disgraced RnB Back in the days there was actually talent involved in it. Many of the classic RnB groups played their own instruments and wrote their own lyrics. This trash is just disgraceful! <br /> <br />If all you XXXL ghetto thug kids want real music listen to stuff like Tool, Faith No More, or Metallica.
B000092ZYX|4.0|...It's still a rock-solid album. This CD has some really great songs, like 2+2=5, Backdrifts, Go To Sleep, and There There, but my only problem with it, is quite a lot of the songs sound the same. Once you get to tracks 10 and up, they are pretty much the same sound. Lyrics are great, music is great, but I stop listening when it gets to be a mess of ambient noise.    Key tracks:  2+2=5  There There  Go To Sleep  Backdrifts  The Gloaming    EDIT: I've completely changed my mind. This album is one of Radiohead's best. I can't change the rating, but I will say that it's as good as In Rainbows, so if you like one, get the other.
B000002LRX|5.0|yep, this masterpiece is only 7 bucks...$6.95 plus tax....<br /><br />anyway, this album is amazing, showcasing Patton's wierd vocal styles...<br /><br />best songs are:A small victory, Kindergarten, land of sunshine, midlife crisis....hell, the whole album rocks, get it, its cheap and well worth all seven dollars!
B00003CXTG|2.0|I was quite looking forward to this film, my only worry was that like most hollywood films, it may consentrate on being be very pro american as opposed to being accurate? in its favour, some of the scenes are spectacular (pearl harbor especially) but ultimately my main fear was recognised. it really is a great tribute for the brave american service men, but thats just my point...... the americans for example (and my biggest problem with this film) the battle of britain scene (a battle that America wouldnt get involved with!). 507 british pilots lost their lives during theses months as well as many polish, canadian and australian men etc that came over to help out. over 10.000 civillians were also killed in bombing raids. and was this portrayed in the film..... No? ben affleck single handedly won the battle of Britain in 5 minutes? what a hero. if this hollywood nonsence is what you like then you will love pearl harbor, if not then stay away!
1931559317|5.0|This is not the first small-format 7th magnitude atlas to appear on the market.  But it is the first that is actually usable.  The creators have somehow managed to fit in a compact, affordable package an atlas which includes over 30,000 stars down to magnitude 7.6 with very little crowding or cramping.  To achieve the compromise, the charts number 80, arranged in 8 gores (strips of sky from pole to pole), each one covering 3 hours of right ascension, the charts within ordered from north to south.  This arrangement works well, as maps of the same season are in the same section.  I would have wished the gores to be arranged in order of descending right ascension rather than ascending, but this is a matter of general principle; in this atlas it has hardly any practical effects.      The atlas is superbly useful in the field. It goes considerably beyond the traditional 6th magnitude atlas, revealing three times as many stars, making better use of 6x30 and larger finder scopes, and enabling the user to find bright asteroids and the planet Neptune.  The colors used in the charts are not a problem under a red flashlight.  Even the stick figures which depict the constellations are drawn so that they are readily distinguishable from the coordinate lines and do not interfere.    It contains a feature overlooked in too many small atlases.  At the edges of each chart are the numbers of adjoining charts.  Just go out into the field with an atlas that doesn't have them, and you'll understand immediately why they are important.    There are detailed charts of the Pleiades, LMC, Orion's sword, and the Virgo Galaxy Cluster.  This last one probably should have been oriented vertically (portrait instead of landscape).  At the expense of a couple galaxies on the western fringes, the chart would reach 6 or 7 degrees declination farther south--just about down to the star Porrima--to include quite a lot more galaxies, including M61.    It is small enough to pack alongside a pair of binoculars or in a car's glove compartment.  The spiral binding is a useful touch.  It allows the atlas to lie open flat without paperweights and also makes it easy to fold back and hold it in one hand.  The pages are sturdy and dew resistant.  The cover, however, should be tougher.    In places the charts seem a bit busy; this is due not to the scale, which is only slightly smaller than that of the Sky Atlas 2000.0, but to the occasionally lavish labelling.  For example, what is the point of adding \\"Bode's Nebulae\\" to M81 and M82?    With such small pages, the area covered by each chart is limited.  But the designers have managed the resulting problems well.  The charts contain enough overlap that when an area of interest falls on the seam between two charts, one of them is likely to include the area in its entirety. The layout of adjacent charts on two-page spreads also helps.     To be sure, the Pocket has imperfections, but many of them are a compromise between competing considerations, and they are handled as well as in any small atlas on the market.    As a space saver, the compilers have omitted the lists of interesting objects.  No problem, just buy a separate observer's guide and write out a list of your targets before going out for the evening.    For advanced observers, the Pocket is a great companion to Uranometria or the Millennium, use the Pocket for quick, hassle-free finds of ordinary objects and the big atlas for ferreting out the real challenges.    Users of binoculars and small telescopes have long faced a selection of 5th to 6th magnitude star atlases which show under 10,000 stars and range in quality from OK to poor.  There is now no need to worry about the choice.  Just get the Pocket.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Has the, er, pond, frozen over?! That was my thought when I was browsing a music store while waiting for my glasses to repair and spotted this album.  This is music that I grew up on, associate with from puberty, and love baiting Stones fans with the question, \\"Didn't GNR take an excellent song, Sympathy for the Devil, and make it better?\\" <br /> <br />I recently learned that my hip big city cousin was invited to some Axl Rose event, but went to the Dominican Republic instead.  Figures that a kid who idolizes Paris Hilton would do that, but we both bond over the amazing guitar riff and lyrics found in \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\" so despite our 11 year age span, we both are in full agreement that this album rocks, whether played from the original albums (of which I own most) on vinyl, cassette tape, compact disc, or MP3 format.  Of course, cousin just says something like, \\"it's hot\\" while I say, \\"it's unbelievable!\\" <br /> <br />As for those whom I cannot convert, well, buy the album and make the educated choice yourself.  Good music is good music, and as far as I'm concerned Axl Rose is just another name for William Bruce Rose, Jr. (if you use wikipedia as your source).  I for one am thankful for this album arriving in my CD player and subsquently on my MP3 player. <br /> <br />

0553274503|5.0|This is the top book I recommend, and have recommended, since reading it in eighth grade and then re-reading it on a long, rainy car trip this April. <br /> <br />The beauty of the book is that you can read (or not read) deeper meaning into it.  Regardless, there is a piece of the journey from unaware to fully aware to only somewhat aware that I would think anyone could empathize.  My only caveat is that it has the ability to really make you think, but only if you let it.   <br /> <br />So who has my copy right now?  I feel like re-reading it just from writing the review!
6305882592|5.0|I realize that this has movie is already well-reviewed, but it is certainly a timeless classic if there every was one.
1400034205|5.0|This is Maugham's last great book, coming decades after his magnum opus, Of Human Bondage. The guy could write, what can I say? If you don't read it, it's your loss.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|This special edition DVD has all the bells and whistles one would want for this film.  Most already know the story, but this film was made before the era of computer graphics, and the stars did most of their own stunts.  And this film certainly has a list of stars.  The film was actually completed in a fairly short time.  The film is long, but really doesn't drag very much, as there are a lot of subplots to tidy up and give background to the action.  And in this film, you keep ahead of the actors, in that you know things they do not know. <br /> <br />The commentary by F.X.Feeney really helps one understand how the film was composed and the scenes were set.  He does, however, come to some opposite conclusions to some of the commentary for the scene specific commentary on the second disc. <br /> <br />For those who saw or remember the film in the theater, this is the DVD you have been waiting for.  The two set DVD does the film justice. <br /> <br />This film was done in the old fashioned manner.  Great stars, showmanship, and no computer graphics.  And a well written script to go along with the special effects.  Some of the scenes filmed then are as good as any computer graphics could do now. <br /> <br />I give the film five stars for its type, not five stars because it is five stars compared with any other film out there.
0393317552|4.0|Is Jared Diamond tendentious? Of course. Is he as bad as Stephen Jay Gould? No. There's a whiff of Lysenkoism (a term I just learned and like...it means using science to justify some ideological aim) to the book, but there is much that is fruitful and edifying. This should be read by everyone, left, right, or center. Just be aware that this is a theoretical work, relying on a great deal of circumstantial evidence, and that Diamond wants nothing to do with any explanation that factors in physiological differences between groups of human beings...especially regarding innate intelligence.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Excellent! It's a shame this version did not come to the screen. <br />Everything make more sense now
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This movie is perfect, if you hate character development, logical plot progressions, meaningful endings and any emotional attachment. <br /> <br />My girlfriend and I watched this still-born child of a movie and instead of a chance to steal a quick snog I spent the better part of 2 hours looking for something with which to hang myself. <br /> <br />It's pastiche-styled movie of jumbling characters who have nothing better to do than struggle over their overly-sappy issues with love and fall prey to nearly every character stereotype quickly available to ashole who wrote this.(sensitive man, sensitive woman, jaded woman, jaded man, eyes-gouged-out audience member) <br />This while not giving the viewer enough time to empathize with any of the characters because the director's school of thought was obviously influenced by the world-reknowned \\"Sesame Street editing method.\\"  <br />I think at one point we were supposed to feel sad? Perhaps, later, happy? I don't know, I was too busy weeping uncontrollably. <br /> <br />I hated this movie MORE than Cheaper by the Dozen. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie all the time to people I despise. <br />
B000FGGE68|3.0|I felt that this movie relied too much on the CGI and the BS factor is extremely high but it was mildy entertaining and the time passed quickly.  Milla is gorgeous, as she is in everything, but aside from one buttock shot and a bare middrif, there is no skin.  At least with The Fifth Element we got a little nipple!
B00005JKJA|5.0|From the very first frame of the movie I knew this was going be a movie experince unlike any other. <br /> <br />The opening scene if the attempted murder and the collision tragedy was quite a lot to take in for an opening sequence, but knowing David Lynch's work, its all part of the filmmaking. <br /> <br />First you see a posh looking woman in the back of limo. Flicking back through scenes there is a group of youngsters racing down the side of hill.  <br />The limo stops and out comes the front passenger with a pistol points to the woman in the back of the limo. <br /> <br />Before you know it, the youngters eradicately driving about collide with the limo killing the other two people holding the woman hostage. <br /> <br />The woman walks (or crawls I should say) away from the wreck with no memory of anything at all. <br /> <br />On from there embarks a weird, suspenseful and innovative adventure which only Lynch can direct. <br />Supremely acted by the director (in the movie) who at first has a nerdy and shallow attitude, he becomes of my favorite characters ever to slew their presence in screenplay. <br /> <br />All in all this movie really gets your mind racing. While some things may seem awkward an unnecessary, there is reasoning behind it all. <br /> <br />VERY GOOOD WATCH, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0805076476|4.0|This 1996 debut novel launched Portland's most disturbed son into modest literary fame, with which Palanhiuk built an army of dedicated nihilists who turned out for his readings/signings by the hundreds and made bestsellers of his eight subsequent books. When the book was translated to film by screenwriter Jim Uhls and director David Fincher, newcomers to the author's work and faithful readers alike heralded it as a skillful, accurate, and altogether perfect book-to-film translation. Featuring the talent of Helena Bonham Carter, Brad Pitt, and Edward Norton, with a memorable score by producers-turned-DJs The Dust Brothers, Fincher's Fight Club is as essential to every reader's library as its paperback predecessor. <br /> <br />To read more reviews visit the Void Magazine website.
0446677450|3.0|This could be a pamphlet.  A good pamphlet, but a pamphlet nonetheless.  Sadly, it is a book, a rather poorly written one.  Oddly, I'm glad I'm reading it, because it's helping me to examine some of my unexamined assumptions about the world and my career.<br /><br />I just wish it were a better read.

B000002MG1|5.0|This is one of those albums that you appreciate more each time you listen to it.  Rarely can an album be considered a masterpiece, but this comes close.  First, I need to say that I am not even an R.E.M. fan.  I don't like their old stuff and I don't like thier new stuff.  Nothing personal, it just doesn't do anything for me.  I bought this album after I got Dashboard Confessional's \\"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar enhanced limited edition\\" which had a bonus DVD of DC playing 7 covers of R.E.M. from \\"Automatic For The People.\\"  The DVD got me so into the songs that I had to go and buy it (my brother had it when I was younger but I didn't appreciate it then).  I used to like \\"Man On The Moon\\" when I was younger, but this album has so much more than that.  \\"Drive\\" starts the album perfectly and \\"Try Not To Breathe\\" is excellent, with heartfelt lyrics.  \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is one of the most emotional songs ever written and Stipe's voice sings each note to perfection.  I remember when the music video came out and thinking how amazing it was and how the song fit so well with it.  One of my favorite songs on this album is \\"Nightswimming,\\" which once again, Stipe's voice shines on.  The piano floats effortlessly around the lyrics and the imagery is top-notch (see below):<br /><br />Nightswimming deserves a quiet night.<br /><br />The photograph on the dashboard, taken years ago,<br /><br />turned around backwards so the windshield shows.<br /><br />Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse.<br /><br />Still, it's so much clearer.<br /><br />I forgot my shirt at the water's edge.<br /><br />The moon is low tonight.<br /><br />Nightswimming deserves a quiet night.<br /><br />I'm not sure all these people understand.<br /><br />It's not like years ago,<br /><br />The fear of getting caught,<br /><br />of recklessness and water.<br /><br />They cannot see me naked.<br /><br />These things, they go away,<br /><br />replaced by everyday.<br /><br />Nightswimming, remembering that night.<br /><br />September's coming soon.<br /><br />I'm pining for the moon.<br /><br />And what if there were two<br /><br />Side by side in orbit<br /><br />Around the fairest sun?<br /><br />That bright, tight forever drum<br /><br />could not describe nightswimming.<br /><br />You, I thought I knew you.<br /><br />You I cannot judge.<br /><br />You, I thought you knew me,<br /><br />this one laughing quietly underneath my breath.<br /><br />Nightswimming.<br /><br />The photograph reflects,<br /><br />every streetlight a reminder.<br /><br />Nightswimming deserves a quiet night, deserves a quiet night.<br /><br />This album is very beautiful and sweeping, with lush instrumentation and the best vocals and lyrics of any R.E.M. album.  I also enjoy \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\" and the other songs, although they do not catch my attention as much as the other songs, but are still great.  This album is great on a road trip to listen all the way through.  Even if you are not a fan of R.E.M. (like me), I highly recommend this album.soon.  <br />I'm pining for the moon.  <br />And what if there were two  <br />Side by side in orbit  <br />Around the fairest sun?  <br />That bright, tight forever drum  <br />could not describe nightswimming.  <br /> <br />You, I thought I knew you.  <br />You I cannot judge.  <br />You, I thought you knew me,  <br />this one laughing quietly underneath my breath.  <br />Nightswimming.  <br /> <br />The photograph reflects,  <br />every streetlight a reminder.  <br />Nightswimming deserves a quiet night, deserves a quiet night. <br /> <br />This album is very beautiful and sweeping, with lush instrumentation and the best vocals and lyrics of any R.E.M. album.

B000ENWKN8|3.0|I bought this cd not expecting much after sinister urge. i disliked that album, but i still wanted to give rob a chance. i think if it were by someone else, maybe an underground talent i would give this cd more stars. unfortunately it falls flat of all zombies previous work. i think maybe he should give up the music and stick to his real calling, movies, before he disappoints with another lackbuster performance as this.<br /><br />as for what another reviewer(s) said, i was surprised as well there was absolutely no cussing and no parental advisory on the cover. i thought i bought it at Best Buy, not Wal-mart. i searched all over, but i guess it was just released this way and wasn't an edited cd. maybe your kids will like it.<br /><br />oh yeah, it is only 11 tracks with 2 of those being extremely short. this should have been an EP. oh wait, all of Zombie's CDs are only about 11-13 songs long.

B00003CXB7|5.0|M.A.S.H. is one of the best war movies ever.  If you are a big Tom Skerritt fan, this is his best piece of work. All in all this movie is sparatic and comical. The actor playing Hawkeye is a cheap man's Kiefer Sutherland, but that is the only bad part of the movie.  Robert Duvall once again does an outstanding job acting, playing Major Burns.  Elliot Gould and Rene Auberjonois show they have true Gritt!!  Also JoAnn Pflug keeps it real!
B00005JJX8|5.0|Was impressed with the prompt processing of my order and in its fast delivery.  I have watched the movie twice.  I really like most of Cary Grant's movies, and this one's no exception.  The package was in great condition.  I will likely use Amazon again.
0684824906|5.0|What I admire about Doris Kearns' book is the dexterity with which she balances the dynamics of Lincoln's cabinet within the context of the civil war.  She doesn't lose her story in Lincoln's melancholy, or the minutiae of civil war battles.  Instead, we see Lincoln prevailing in spite of the poltical intrigue of his own cabinet, the loss of early and major battles, in-fighting within the Republican party, the personal loss of several sons, a despondent wife, all with the blood of thousands of union and confederate soldiers on his hands.  We haven't seen since and may never see again the likes of Abraham Lincoln because no once will ever be as self-sacrificing as Lincoln.<br /><br />If I ever get the chance to meet Doris Kearns Goodwin in person, I will thank her for her magnificent effort.
1401307450|5.0|I've read a lot of rock star bios and this one sticks.  Why?  Kiedis's unflinching honesty, graphic depiction of a life lived without structure and the fact that he has lived to tell the tale.  It's all here.  The drugs, the booze, the sex, the debauchery.  So what, you might ask, is so unusual about that?  Don't all rock star bios share these elements?  Yeah, most of them do.  But the difference here is Anthony Kiedis's story is a bloodletting without being preachy and full of predictable fluff.  He never judges, he never steps up to the pulpit and warns the world.  He never shoves 12 step sensibilities down anyones' throat.  He tells his tale with charm, kid bravado and, surprisingly, humility. He admits his faults. He admits his immaturity.  Through every chapter we watch him grow.  He takes two steps forward, then ten steps back.  Then he takes five steps forward and two steps back.<br /><br />What I particularly found refreshing was the stories Kiedis tells about his inspirations for many Chili Pepper songs.  Here is a man who cared (s) about the finished product. (If you doubt that, check out their latest effort, Stadium Arcadium.  It's a masterpiece.)<br /><br />You want to cry with Kiedis and you want to laugh with him during the entire bumpy ride.  And I personally was wondering how his father was able to take a series of pictures of his eight year old son smoking pot without the folks over at the Fotomat running interference when he took them to be developed.  Unless, of course, they were Polaroids.  Then  that point is moot I guess. Nevertheless, I hated his dad for the things he exposed Anthony to at such an early age.  We're lucky Kiedis turned out as good as he did in the end.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a rock star bio worth the effort.  It's long, it's detailed, yes. Some details come off as too much information.  But still, it's never a boring read. No fluff, no filler.  Just a cautionary tale told with the best of intentions.  And if he had to name his bio after a Pepper's song, Scar Tissue was the perfect choice.he had to name his bio after a Pepper's song, Scar Tissue was the perfect choice.
B00005LC1H|4.0|The show is hilarious and the DVD quality is just fine. If you remember this show, this set is perfect for you!
0140544518|5.0|As an adult, I love this book even though it was gifted to my 1 year old son for his birthday! I recommend a thick Texan drawl--it busts our kids up!    A word of warning to those of you buying for young children. If your young toddler doesn't know the original story of the three pigs, he/she won't get the concept of the wolf having a different perspective on how things \\"went down.\\"  This is more suitable for older children, but don't hesitate to buy it for yourself and wait until they too are pulling it off the shelf!
B00001IVOR|5.0|I was 16 years old when this cd dropped, and I didn't listen to hip hop at all at the time.  I was a skateboarder, and all I listened to was punk rock back then.  I didn't really get the slang, styles, or concepts of hip hop; and I never really gave hip hop a chance before this cd came out.  However, I do remember a lot of my friends telling me how nice The Wu were, and how excited they were when this cd was released.        After seeing the video for \\"Triumph\\" a few times, I knew that The Wu were dope.  I didn't realize it at the time, but \\"Triumph\\" actually changed my whole perspective of hip hop.  To this day, I believe that this song is the best posse cut ever.  Inspectah Dek and Method Man jump start this song with incredible back to back verses, and the beat is epic.  I've heard this song hundreds of times, but I still get amped whenever it's playing.  Everyone spits a good verse on this song, and the energy of the track is incredible.      \\"It's Yourz\\" is another classic.  This is a great closing track for disc 1.  Similar to \\"Triumph\\", this song has a lot of energy.  It also has a great hook.  This time it's The Rza and Inspectah Dek who lace the track with the most memorable verses.      A lot of people hate on this cd, but I don't understand why.  Although \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\" is not anywhere near as raw as \\"36 Chambers\\", it is definitely more lyrical.  I don't agree with all these filler complaints either.  I have listened to both of these discs repetitively for nearly a decade, and the only tracks I skip aren't actual songs.    My favorite tracks include:    Disc 1  Reunited-great verses from The Gza and Meth  Visionz-great Production from The Rza  Older Gods-love the beat and Ghostface's verse  It's Yourz-see Inspectah Dek verse    Disc 2  Triumph-The Anthem  Little Ghetto Boys-one of Cappadonna's more memorable verses  Hellz Wind Staff-dope song w/ martial arts vibe  Heaterz-another great beat courtesy of The Rza    The Last Words:  Classic cd.  It honestly changed my life.
B00005MP58|4.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is visually outstanding. I appreciate the care they took in following the book so carefully.What I wished as I watched it was that Matthew Macfadyen was the Mr. Darcy. Matthew can say so much with just a look and his words have so much emotion compared to Colin who had almost none when I felt the situation called for it. Maybe someday they will make yet another version with Matthew and Keira in this original format.....or is that just wishful thinking?
B0002IQEHI|4.0|North By Northwest. <br /> <br />A film by Alfred Hitchcock. It stars Cary Grant who is one of my favourite actors and Eva Marie  <br />Saint. Grant plays the part of Robert  Thornhill who is an advertising executive in New York.   <br /> <br />One day while waiting for a meeting he is mistaken by some people who  are in the smuggling  <br />and spy game, headed by Phillip VanDamm played  nicely by James Mason.   <br /> <br />Then starts a 3000 mile chase across the United States with Grant  trying to figure out the puzzle  <br />he has found himself in mistaken for  a Mr.. Kaplin who was a fictitious character created by US  <br />intelligence  agents to trap VanDamm.   <br /> <br />He meets up with double agent Eve Kendall played by Eva Marie Saint  and falls head over heels  <br />for her. They begin their \\"affair\\" on a train  of all places where Grant does his best to hide from  <br />the train conductor  while still traveling and a really nice conversation over a dinner scene.   <br /> <br />The movie then goes to various locations including a road in the country where Grant is crop  <br />dusted by a crop duster plane. He steals a car to get back to the city when the plane crashes  <br />into a truck while trying to attack him on the ground. He does so because when the crash  <br />happens some spectators stop by to have a look.   <br /> <br />Back in the city he manages to find Eve Kendall again and then resume his adventure,  <br />mainly to find out what is going on. The next big set piece is a precarious climb up to  <br />a house on the top of Mount Rushmore. It's a great scene and concludes the movie  <br />though to be honest I found a lot of the movie slightly predictable and I don't know  <br />whether its living in this modern age of crappy remakes and such but I didn't find  <br />Hitchcock was all he is cracked up to be, at least in this film.  <br />
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Being in the military and being stationed in japan, I bought this for my girlfriend right when I got stationed here because she had mentioned to me that she would like some seasons of sex and the city. I wanted to suprise her with it, so I looked it up on here, Amazon, and found that everyone liked the complete series rather than buying the individual seasons. It is true, you do save alot more money. When she got it she said she was estatic, and that she almost bought the same one. She said she liked all the little extra things it came with, the bios and such almost as much as the episodes themself. I was pleased with my purchase, as was she.
B0006B2A42|3.0|\\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is just OK -- it is a dated \\"brink of World War III\\" Cold War-relic.  Most notably, it is overlong and suffers from a wooden performance by Rock Hudson, who is stiffer than the ice floes at the North Pole.  Shoddy special effects and sets also detract.  On the positive side, performances by Patrick McGoohan and Ernest Borgnine were well worth watching.  One comes away wishing McGoohan, best known for his television work as \\"The Prisoner\\" and \\"Secret Agent\\" (AKA \\"Danger Man\\"), had been in more films.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|When I bought this album I didn't know what to expect considering the only song I've heard at the time was \\"Crazy\\". My first impression on this album was \\"Wow, such crazy music\\". This album is great because it is something different that artists of today would have never made. I would have never expected this from Cee-Lo. The Pros for the album outweigh the Cons. The only Cons are the album length is no greater than 38 minutes and the singing voice of Cee-Lo tends to sound too much like the same thing as the album goes on. The beats almost hide the singing, as the beats are the type you'll never get out of your head. Here is a song by song review: <br />-1.Go-Go Gadget Gospel: A crazy beat to start the album off on the right note. If you were to take the beat out of the song you would get something you would hear in Harlem on a Sunday morning. The beat makes this song the number 1 dance in your car songs of 2006. 10/10 <br />-2.Crazy: The first single of the album. If you haven't heard it yet then your crazy just like me. 10/10 <br />-3.St.Elsewhere: A much slower song than the previous two but still a great song. It kinda sounds like what you would think it would sound like if you looked at the album cover for a long time. 10/10 <br />-4.Gone Daddy Gone: Another crazy beat. Verses are too short as the chorus is repeated every 15 seconds. Isn't as good the last three songs but is still an above average song. 9/10 <br />-5.Smiley Faces: Really fun lyrics that go perfectly with the song and would put a smile on anyone's face after the first listen. 10/10 <br />-6.The Boogie Monster: The worst song on the album, which means if you like this song than you'll love the album. This song brings back memories of my grade 2 Halloween parade. 6/10 <br />-7.Feng Shui: Before I bought this album I listened to the sample of this song on Amazon and I loved it. I was sad to find out that it is the shortest song on the album. It's not my favourite song on the album but it is very good. 10/10 <br />-8.Just A Thought: This song should be the next single as it is by far the best (and my favourite) song of the whole 38 minutes. It is the first song that reaches a decent length in playing time. It sounds much like a song by the White Stripes. 12/10 <br />-9.Transformer: This is a very catchy song that you won't get out of your head until Christmas. If you like crazy than you'll love this song. 10/10 <br />-10.Who Cares?: Another slower song that brings the tempo of the album down a notch. By this point in the album the singing starts to sound too much like the same thing and not that interesting to listen too. 10/10 <br />-11.Online: Some of the lyrics in this song are hard to understand because I don't think that Cee-Lo sings the first verse in the song. Nether the less, it's still a great song. 10/10 <br />-12.Necromancer: A song that doesn't fit well with the theme of the album. A hard song to explain. 7.5/10 <br />-13.Storm Coming: I love this song. Very funky. Also a great song to listen to during a lightning storm. 10/10 <br />-14.The Last Time: A great way to end this album. The only thing I couldn't believe is that when you reach this song, you've only listened to 34 minutes of the album.9/10 <br />Overall:9.6/10 <br />Deduct points for shortness of album:9.1/10 <br />
B000089CJI|5.0|Ladies and Gents -  <br /> <br />I remember the first time I heard \\"Such Great Heights\\".  The opening, with the beeping back and forth from left to right, instantly hooked me.  I played the song over and over about twenty times.  My heart raced (and I am being literal here).  Then I ventured to listen to the whole album and I've never been the same since.  Never could I say I had a \\"favorite band\\".  I'd always make something up when someone would ask me that question.  But I can now, without hesitation, proclaim The Postal Service as the answer to all questions!  I can listen to the album whenever, wherever, with whomever.  Some people don't like the music, that's okay, Tchaikovsky was hated when he broke on to the scene.  The Postal Service is something so different that those not equipped to handle change would undoubtebly hate it.  But those of us evolving at rapid speed enjoy every lyric, every beat, every emotional punch and pick-me-up from this great album.  Love it.  Glad to hear that another album is planned for 2007 because I haven't been able to find anything or anyone that sounds like the Postal Service.  Bravo gents!  You did it.  Thank God Almighty we are free at last.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I'd listened to Agaetis Byrjun countless times when I finally picked up Takk... Too often the initial burst of creativity that a band brings to their first maor release fizzles; not so with Sigur Ros. Takk... continues opening new auditory scapes to the listener with even more depth, complexity, and raw emotion. <br /> <br />I find that people either really like Sigur Ros, or they don't. I find that it touches deep places within; if you enjoy those places being touched, this is your music. <br /> <br />That said it's not necessarily easy to listen to; not some set of catchy hooks; the tracks and album tell a sonic story that builds and progresses. Picking up in the middle doesn't make a lot of sense and at times can be a bit jarring =) <br /> <br />In short I can't say enough about this album or the artists. It's a truly original sound (at least to me), and living in the north (Maine) I appreciate how it describes the natural world.
0440241413|5.0|I have to admit that I found the beginning of this light-hearted little novel to be quite slow and a little boring.  Rebecca Bloomwood, the would be heroine of \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" by Sophie Kinsella is a shallow, egocentric twenty-five year old who is a journalist for a financial magazine.  The job bores her to tears; she literally paraphrases pamphlets that she receives at press conferences for her articles.  She lives in a very nice flat thanks to Suze, her wealthy friend who lives off a trust fund.  And, she shops~~and shops~~and shops!!  Even though Rebecca knows that she is deeply in debt, she continues to spend exorbitant amounts of money on clothes, shoes, make-up and scarves.  She even owes her roommate.  These are all things that she does not need but she is quite good at rationalizing every purchase.   <br /> <br />She receives bills from the bank, from Visa and even from store accounts almost daily and like the ostrich who puts her head in a hole, Rebecca either throws away the envelope or hides them in her drawer while continuing to shop.  Making a purchase actually calms her nerves.  And then we have her problem telling untruths.  She actually puts on a job application that she is fluent in Finnish--of course everything always catches up with her and she is constantly being humiliated.  It is at this point in the book that I became hooked!  I became enchanted with Miss Bloomwood's escapades, her fantasies, even her relationships.  They were all laugh out loud funny!   <br /> <br />Finally, Rebecca discovers her soul, her passion her conscience, even her intelligence.  And when that happens, she discovers love.  I ended up loving this little book; I had a smile on my face throughout the story.
B0002W18MU|5.0|Its one of the most honest efforts in songwriting I've heard. I'm listening to it and crying. Its just truth and honesty. No posturing, no trying to appear cool, just pain, regret and hope from repentence. My collection has about 3000 CDs in it, but this is going into the 20-30 which are in regular rotation. The postumous arrangements are perfect as well as the musicians chosen to fill out the recordings. Its a beautiful crown to end a magnificent career... but painful to listen to because it reminds of the tremendous loss it was when he died. An illustration of his growth as an artist up until the day he died.

1401302378|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the long tail and I believe online bookstores are a perfect example of who utilizes the long tail and who doesn't. I have to admit that Amazon and Ebay has been excellent in manufacturing ways to have more products seen by more potential customers than their competitors. You can go to every online bookstore and basically see the same top 100 books promoted over and over, but you can only sell so many copies of the same books. Amazon does make it easier to see new and odd titles with their Listmania Lists, So You'd Like to, Customers Also Bought and Customers Tagged. Amazon is way ahead of other online bookstores at displaying more titles. I would like to see customers recommendations brought back though.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt's book is the most sensitive and honest memoirs I have read to date. McCourt does not pine for the reader's sympathy, but instead writes his memories as a child in a very matter-of-fact style. He is a boy who knows no other life, and is making the best of what he does know. A boy who loves his family and friends despite their many shortcomings. A boy who finds happiness and joy in the simple things in life. From this, we (especially Americans) can all learn a lot. Because McCourt wrote in this style, at times, I found myself on the brink of sadness, laughter, embarrassment and anger at the same moment. How could a boy write so lovingly about a father so neglectful of his family? How was he able to find any humor in the midst of such suffering? The answers to these elements are what make Frank McCourt's writing so meaningful.     I must admit that for the first part of the book I had trouble understanding why McCourt's writing was so fragmented. But as I continued to read, I actually felt myself entering mid-twentieth century Ireland, one with its people and culture. At that point, I realized that this was the way the book had to be written for the reader to truly live the experience. I chuckled to myself for ever doubting McCourt's style.     In conclusion, even if you are unable to glean the bits of humanity from Angela's Ashes, it is still definitely worth the read for the sensational storytelling alone. I look forward to reading the other books in McCourt's repertoire.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|First of all, I apologize in advance if I make tons of mistakes!! (I live in Argentina and speak spanish, so I'll do my best to write the review in english!) <br /> <br />I've just received the DVD (I bought it in Argentina from an e-shop that got it from a pre-sale). As soon as I opened it I put the first disc on my dvd player, the root menu loaded and... WOW <br />AMAZING MIND-BLOWING CONCERT!!! <br />I couldn't believe the video quality (I'd seen the laserdisc and vhs versions before, and believe me, the video quality is WAY better), the 5.1 mix ROCKS, and the extra features are very good (specially bootlegging the bootleggers). <br /> <br />I RECOMMEND this DVD to all music fans. You won't be disappointed at all. This show is, by far, the best rock concert I've ever seen. <br /> <br />
0553378384|1.0|This book is awful!  I am an astrologer for over 30 years. You cannot have a North Node without a South. By the way, a client brought me this who got it from a \\"friend\\"........... Who thought they could benefit in their personal life. She was very upset because she found herself unable to relate to what was being said....she being North Node in Aries.  It turned out , thanks to Ms Spiller..that this woman was having doubts about herself in areas that she clearly had nothing in common with in this particular Node.  The point being, people who are spiritually seeking read this trash think it is complete and have no experience in Astrology to make any distinctions. This book is manipulative and destructive in my opinion. It is lacking in credibility and generalizes in ways that would make a sane person doubt themselves. I am not sure how there are so many positive reveiws; as this book is certainly not a valid depiction of some great spiritul self help book.  My suggestion...... if someone gives you this as a gift and tells you \\" you should read this because it will really help you.......\\"  run the other way. And leave the book on the table......or better yet in the trash! <br />Betsy

B00005JP0A|4.0|I was much more entertained by the TDWP than I expected to be. The movie took the best parts of the book, humanized the characters, and made them more 3-dimensional than they were on paper. Meryl Streep demonstrates once again why she is one of the \\"grandes dames\\" of celluloid, in a pitch-perfect portrayal of Miranda Priestley. Although Streep consistently maintains Miranda's hard edge and bitingly-comedic sarcasm throughout the movie, she also gives us glimpses into the woman behind the mask without watering-down the character the audience loves to hate. I was really pleased to see that the end of the movie refused to insult the audience's intelligence by having Miranda see the \\"error of her ways\\" and undergo a complete (and unrealistic) character transformation. Rather, she maintains her devilish edge while being wise enough to recognize--and respect--the differences between herself and her 2nd assistant, Andrea (\\"Andy\\").  (Refreshingly, at the end of the movie, Miranda has still got the cojones to pull the rug out from under the ever-loyal Nigel to save her own empire).    Anne Hathaway does a really good job in TDWP, and holds her own in her scenes with Streep--no easy task, since pretty much everyone looks like an amateur next to Meryl. While Anne fittingly brings a bit of that wide-eyed innocence to the role of Andy (which made her a pre-teen sensation in the \\"Princess Diaries\\" and the like), it does not completely define her character. It was great to see Hathaway push the envelope a bit, and to show the tension between that innocence and the cutthroat, sink-or-swim world of high-fashion publishing.    The rest of the cast also does an admirable job. Stanley Tucci is a gem as Miranda's long-suffering sidekick, Nigel, and Emily Blunt--with her spot-on comedic timing--shows why she's a young actress to watch. And, of course, you've got to love Simon Baker as the incurable, impossibly-handsome rake, Christian Thompson. He is the ultimate guilty pleasure in thismovie; the cad you know is no good for Andy, but who is so disarmingly charming that you want to see them hook up anyway. I was not the only woman in the movie theater hoping that Andy would dump her boyfriend Nate and get together with Christian! (No small feat, since Adrian Grenier is pretty easy on the eyes as well).    The only reason this movie didn't get 5 stars is the forced \\"reconcilation\\" between Andy and Nate. He had no qualms about moving to Boston to chase his dream of becoming a chef, and I don't think that Andy had any reason to be apologetic about being just as driven about her career goals, whether at Runway magazine or elsewhere. To be quite honest, Nate seemed more like a whiner and an impediment than a supportive boyfriend you would want Andy to get back together with. But this is the only minor pet-peeve I have about this film. Otherwise, TDWP was a great movie that I actually enjoyed even more than the book (for a change!), and will definitely be picking up when it's released on video. Watching Meryl Streep do what she does best is worth the price of admission alone.

B0000DDAU9|4.0|Mastodon's \\"Remission\\" is bound to become a classic in not only the stoner and math breeds, but the genre of metal as a whole.  Building upon a simple formula (musical brutality contrasted with occasional outbursts of nuanced serenity), Mastodon have erected a marvel of modern metal, complete with song titles and musicality that lend credence to the group's namesake.  Layer upon titanic layer of hard-hitting heaviness comprise the majority of this CD, taking no prisoners and damn proud of it.  The guitars often give way to a relentless, pummeling percussion section, blending the two massive elements to create one lumbering, vitality-injected monstrosity.  The beast is tamed from time to time, as on the rather melodic and mellow introductions to \\"Trainwreck\\" and especially \\"Ol'e Nessie,\\" or the unannounced arrival of an all-out groove right in the middle of \\"March of the Fire Ants.\\"  And \\"Elephant Man\\" features some moodier, slower-paced riffing, and is entirely instrumental, letting all the elements flow together smoothly.  The rest of the beast is basically given to primal rhythms and melodies.  Highlights of this aspect include the aptly named \\"Crusher Destroyer,\\" \\"March of the Fire Ants,\\" \\"Where Strides the Behemoth,\\" and the Zeppelin-esque titled \\"Trampled Under Hoof.\\"  \\"Trilobite\\" is a nice hybrid of the two breeds of poetry on display on this incredible disc.  The end result is a powerful creature, albeit one that is sometimes too overbearing and dense in its aural assault.  A prime example of this is the drumming, which, while nearly unmatched in technicality, tends to rely too heavily on fills and thus often times overpower many of the guitar and bass riffs, which are bone-crushingly extreme and dissonantly beautiful in turn (and often at the same time).  A minor complaint, as is the grievance about the lack of clean vocals.  In this vast sea of intensity, they are scarcely needed.  Overall, a great development of Mastodon's sound, which would only be improved upon with their towering follow-up, \\"Leviathan\\".
B000059LGC|5.0|What a classic whodunit murder mystery. Packed to the hilt with fabulous actors, this movie takes you on a splendid ride down the Nile with lush scenery, intriguing plot twists, and characters rife with personal agendas. Mia Farrow carries her complicated character with grace and skill. Angela Lansbury steals every scene she stumbles into. David Niven was never more dashing and elegant. I would love to know the stories behind the story, as the movie filmed in some of the most wondrous locales known to mankind; an entire documentary could be made based on the costuming alone! I highly recommend ordering this classic and joining this exciting ~ and dangerous! ~ journey down the river.

B00005U122|4.0|Well... This DVD shows a really amazing content. Roger Waters on stage, after years and years and years... \\"In the flesh\\" is, for me, the most impressive part. It reminds me of \\"old\\" Pink Floyd times. In musical terms, the DVD is absolutely perfect and well done. However, Waters has, with age, lost lots of his cynic behaviour, which I find is a pity. \\"Another brick in the wall\\" is sung with enthusiasm - but all the despair of the \\"original\\" wall is lost - just the elements which made this masterwork so unbeatable. Well... we all become older, and, to be fair, I leave 4 stars behind. The show is modest but effective.
6300182576|4.0|When a western is written by Elmore Leonard, you know it's gonna be good. Writer of such wonderfully fun films as Jackie Brown, Get Shorty and Out of Sight, this is an earlier Leonard western that today still delivers some fabulous screen moments. Clint Eastwood is in perfect western mode during this one (shot in 1972) and he's obviously having a lot of fun with the lead role of Mr Kidd. <br /> <br />It all begins with Joe Kidd waking up hungover in a jail cell. Once they drag him to court and he gets sentenced to ten days jail, Mexican bandits enter the court with a land dispute and Joe helps the judge to flee. The Mexicans, led by Louis Chama, declare a kind of war then abscond swiftly after the intrusion. Joe gets offered a spot on the posse tracking them down (as he is the best hired gun in town) but knocks it back to serve his ten days. <br /> <br />A mysterious stranger then arrives and pays Kidd's fine, expecting him to help them track down the leader of the baddies. However, Kidd again knocks them back. Then Joe finds out some of his friends have had their horses stolen and lives threatened, and he decides to join the fight to catch the bandits. Naturally what follows is your usual western fare, though done with a certain panache that is a cut above average. <br /> <br />
B00006IUIG|2.0|Personally, I found 8 1/2 to be one of the most boring films I've ever seen.  It was a pretentious, self-indulgent trip down the director's memory lane.  I understood the plot, and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end, but overall was bored silly by stilted, pointless dialogue. <br />Having said that, the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching.  Perhaps 8 1/2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment :P.
B000007MVM|4.0|It's not difficult, especially when his name is on the record you're reviewing. When I'm reading a review, and I see any reference to \\"David Gilmore,\\" I immediately stop reading, sometimes click \\"Not Helpful,\\" and look for another review.<br /><br />\\"The Madcap Laughs\\" got a four-star (\\"Fore-star,\\" haha) rating from me, because even though this disc has no quality to it, or poor quality on the music, it serves almost as a polaroid photograph, much like the early Bob Dylan records, a first-take sloppiness, but you hear the song in its freshness, before multiple takes drain the life out of it. Of course, though, anyone who has followed the Syd Barrett story knows, Syd did take after take after take on these songs. A very tedious process. You see the decline of a good songwriter as it happens. I am a fan of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd, and it's troubling to witness this mess. People blame Syd Barrett's problems on extreme drug use, but the drugs only fueled the problem. Something in his psyche went wrong long before he became what you see here. He was once a good-looking, charismatic man, a good actor, a prodigy with a paint brush, and although still a rookie guitarist when he first found success as a member of Pink Floyd, he was a competent musician and brilliant songwriter. The original membership of Pink Floyd sparked, and some quirk in Barrett's mind, set off by the unexpected death of his father, failure to adjust to life after, then all the pressure from record company people to perform at will, the constant hounding by fans and hangers-on alike, and the marathon LSD and quaalude use, as well as the steady haze of pot smoke and the seedy environment of the clubs that you HAD to visit at the time when you were \\"hip,\\" compounded with who knows what else, would be enough to damage anybody. But there was something in him that simply clicked \\"off\\" at the onset. Nobody has accurately pinned it down, but whatever it was, it was severe. Nick Mason, Rick Wright, and Roger Waters all survived the roller-coaster ride that was the original success of Pink Floyd circa 1967, and they are all fairly normal people, a little worse for the wear, but still functional. The planets converged in a bad way for Barrett, though.<br /><br />\\"The Madcap Laughs\\" catches Barrett right in the throes of his self-destruction, the public humiliation of being fired from the band he named and once spear-headed, and the initial stages of his regrouping. This itself earned \\"Madcap\\" 5 stars from me, but as a quality performance, this is atrocious. No other word for it. Augmenting some of the tracks with several members of The Soft Machine, Humble Pie, and Pink Floyd helped a little, but it seems that formatting this record as Gilmour (thats \\"G-I-L-M-O-U-R,\\" people) and Waters did, illustrates his decline. You go from the coherent, smooth sounding \\"Terrapin\\" to the slightly disjointed \\"No Good Trying\\" and \\"Love You,\\" to the hard-edged \\"No Man's Land,\\" to be jarred by \\"Dark Globe.\\" He simply shreiks the lyrics, then he comes back to sanity, to a degree, with \\"Here I Go.\\" Here, he sounds relaxed, and almost together. \\"Octopus\\" is a little sloppy, but still listenable. \\"Golden Hair\\" is the last time on the disc where you hear anything that resembles the Syd from \\"Piper.\\" \\"Long Gone,\\" \\"Feel,\\" and \\"If It's In You\\" just go down a slippery slope, and it almost seems like Waters and Gilmour (that's \\"G-I-L-M-O-U-R\\") want to show the rest of us what they went through. It's embarrassing to listen to, because by this point, I have no doubt Syd Barrett, in his own addled head, thought he was all that. Yes, he stumbled through it, stopping and saying things like \\"I'll start again,\\" but he went through it all like it was business as usual, and the bad part is, in his case, this WAS business as usual. Saving \\"Late Night\\" for last, is probably a little reward for being good enough to sit through this virtual train-wreck, but there is little doubt the sessions ended like the messheard on \\"If It's In You.\\"<br /><br />It pains me to write anything less than a really great review of Syd Barrett, because I think if he hadn't derailed, he would have been one phenomenal talent, one everybody would respect.<br /><br />I hope he's doing better.<br /><br />P.S. This review was written a week before the news came out about Barrett's death. And contrary to the impression given by this review, I had, and have, a tremendous amount of respect for him and his work.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|What can I say?  When a band comes back from a long, long vacation, and produces a double disc as good as anything they have ever done, it's a beautiful thing.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|...in spite of excellent performances from Heath Ledger (who looks like the Marlboro Man to the tee) and Jake Gyllenhaal, a strong script, and some gorgeous cinematography of the beautiful Wyoming landscape...I just couldn't get very emotionally involved with a relationship between two guys.  There, I've said it.  Very very un-PC but it's the truth.  I have nothing against gays or lesbians---in fact I have always been very \\"gay-friendly\\" from my mid-teens, with a lot of admiration for the pluck and creativity these individuals develop from coping with society's ignorance and bigotry.  But watching 2 guys kissing doesn't do much for me; I kept looking away during the sex scenes.<br /><br />So the female characters were much more interesting: Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and especially the gorgeous Kate Mara.  They were literally like blessed rays of sunshine in a gray and desolate world.  I guess I'm just a sexist pig, LOL.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 4.5 stars; Economic Value: 5 Stars<br /><br />It had been quite a while that I had listened to this album, but strolling through my CD collection the other day, I came across it, and I just had to put it in my CD carousel right then and there. As many others here I suspect, I do own all the regular Beatles albums, as well as the Anthology trilogy. So why own this? Several reasons: (1) maximizing the CD content capability, \\"Beatles 1\\" (27 tracks; 79 min.) gives an incredible whirlwind tour of rock history. In less than 80 min., you feel like you've taken Rock 101. It's just amazing how many musical forms the Beatles took on in a mere 7 years. (2) I don't think I could've \\"convinced\\" my now 16 yr daughter to sample the Beatles if it wasn't for this compilation. (3) The album is thankfully sequenced chronologically, and is a generous serving of Beatles songs. The liner notes and photos are quite nice too. As to the complaints of certain reviewers about this-or-that mono or stereo version of the early songs, it hasn't bothered me before and it doesn't now either. I personally think the sound quality is outstanding. Finally, I can't rate the compilation as such 5 stars, because no Beatles single CD compilation can be perfect, frankly. Yes, \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields\\" are missing, but if we were to add them, what songs would you take back out? A never-ending argument.<br /><br />Last but not least, \\"Beatles 1\\" is another trendsetter, in that it started the craze of other artists being compiled in similar fashion: after seeing the incredible commercial success of \\"Bealtes 1\\", Elvis, Michael Jackson, the Beach Boys, the Bee Gees and many others have followed suit with their own \\"1\\"/\\"Ones\\"/\\"Number Ones\\" album (yes, even Destiny's Child). This album came out 30 years after the Beatles broke up in 1970, and the Fab Four still shows the music industry how it's done.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I really enjoyed Sin City when I rented it. When I saw the unrated version (which adds just a bit), I knew I had to have it. <br /> <br />If you like graphical novels and movies..see, or buy and keep, Sin City...just one great flick!
B0002W18MU|5.0|I'm appreciative of the one reviewer so far who didn't give this an obligatory 5 stars, and suspicious of those that did. So why the full 5? Because, this is one of the most quietly, powerful albums I've heard all year & because it's so personal sounding.<br /><br />To these ears, each American album had something to set it apart from the others & if I were to characterize this (hopefully) latest installment, I'd say A Hundred Highways is the most lonesome sounding of the lot. The sound of a man alone. Stripped of youth, health & any illusions.<br /><br />All of the records in this series could be considered sparse in terms of production & accompaniment. Producer Rick Rubin acts more like a still photographer trying to capture the moment, rather than pull any strings. Which is one reason why they've all been good. He just let Cash be Cash. And in terms of all their previous work together I have to say, Highways is the most low key. It's also one of the most initimate. No Fiona Apples moaning in the background. No flashy covers like \\"Rusty Cage\\" or \\"Hurt\\". No frills at all. Just that voice & maybe a little acoustic guitar & organ. As he's so often proved, Rubin has good taste & this album is a far cry from some sort of open casket funeral.<br /><br />\\"Help Me\\" starts things off & the fragility in Cash's voice cannot be denied. For some this isn't easy to take. The song is a plea & the end result is more heartbroken than desperate. \\"God's Gonna Cut You down\\" is easily the most rousing number on the album & Cash's voice comes across like thunder that is soon to die down in the distance.<br /><br />As many have pointed out \\"309\\" is the last song he wrote. As any fan knows, The Man In Black was fond of train songs & it serves as a fitting epitaph, completely void of any self pity. It's a song about acceptance rather than resistance. One listen to the Hank Williams cover, \\"Evening Train\\" & its not hard to tell what inspired it. Perhaps Cash tossed in his own version just to point that out.<br /><br />Where Americans III & IV feature covers from the likes of Nine Inch Nails & Depeche Mode, any attempt to reach a new fan base is laid to rest in choices like \\"Read My Mind\\" & \\"Four Strong Winds\\". Gordon Lightfoot's classic is typical AM fare while \\"Winds\\" is mostly familiar to fans of Neil Young. For my money, Cash steals them both for his own, bringing a gravitas that lends each a new meaning. And though I'm not a particularly a Springsteen fan, he's always seemed tailor made for Cash. Further Up The Road ranks up there with his classic take on Highway Patrolman. As for things like, \\"Rose Of My Heart\\", the conviction of Cash's delivery puts to rest any fears of  Hallmark sentimentality.<br /><br />As the song self-depricatingly suggests, Cash was indeed a \\"legend in his time \\"& this album is best thought of as a quiet, meditive coda to a career that began with the immortal line,\\" I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\\". True, the ravages of illness are apparent & some people just won't be able to get beyond that. But if you're able to, you'll be rewarded.mericans III & IV feature covers from the likes of Nine Inch Nails & Depeche Mode, any attempt to reach a new fan base is laid to rest in choices like \\"Read My Mind\\" & \\"Four Strong Winds\\".

B00080ZG10|5.0|This movie is bound to be a timeless classic. The directing and acting were superb. The story probably reflects the most interesting time of Howard Hughes life and Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job portraying Mr Hughes. In fact I feel it is his best performance so far.    Hughes is one of the most interesting characters of the 20th century and in this movie you will find out why. He was an amazing man who made decisions quickly and decisively. I think you will learn a lot about the man and it will also leave you inspired to think bigger then you have been. One of my favorite lines from the movie is when Howard tells his engineer to stop thinking like an insect!    I own this one and have watched it numerous times sometimes by just fast forwarding it to my favoite parts. I was truly inspired by it and especially at the end when you see him as a young boy saying he was going to make the biggest movies and fly the fastest planes and become the richest man in the world. It just goes to show how a boy with some dreams can become a man with great realities.
B0002IU988|4.0|This album sounds like an updated version of 80's metal ala Skid Row and Motley Crue.  If you dig those kinds of bands like I do, you'll really like this album.  The track that got me to buy it is called Miseducation and it was after I heard Sebastian Bach interviewed on a national radio show one night. It was well worth the $13 bucks or so.
B000000OMP|5.0|This album is great. Admittedly. But the original, British mix, including Colin Hodgkinson (instead of Neil Murray) and Mel Galley (instead of John Sykes)is far, far superior. The music haad far more balls and less flash. The mix, with Cozy's drumming, was like atomic blast after atomic blast on my stereo. I remember that well 20-something years later! Release the British mix. American releases always suck by comparison.
B00005M1SL|5.0|I remember way back in '80 when this movie was the buzz of Hollywood. That is, the buzz on Johnny Carson.  The media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself.<br /><br />Yet, in the mid 80's, it came out on both Betamax and VHS, and naturally I bought me a Beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was.<br /><br />First, it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption.  It is long and intraclly woven together.  it is lavish and sometimes loud.  It is a brutal slap in the face to \\"Manifest Destiny\\" and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is \\"God's\\" country.  As if their 'God\\" gave them wealth and privilige and that this God justifies revolution, massacre and war.<br /><br />Many comparisons can be mase with the America of the late 19th century and the America ruled presently by King George W. and his robber barons of Capitalism.  But it is now, as then, much more conveniant to steer the \\"common man\\" into their churches, into their army,  into their lies.  The enemy is those \\"illegal aliens\\" those in the \\"gay agenda,\\" those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo.  Kris Kristofferson plays a mayor/sherriff if wealth and means who (shock-shock) sides with the common man and the undertrodden.  When another of his \\"breeding and class\\" challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class, he replies to the creep:  \\"You are not of my class, to be of my class you first have to die and be born again!\\"<br /><br />This is a revolutionary movie, meant to be savored, each and every minute of it.  This movie dares you to look at  things usually not into history books or shown on the History Channel.
B000002MP2|1.0|First of all I'm going to get a lot of negative feedback but this album is extremely overrated and it gave birth to one of the worst genres on earth, punk-pop! You hear a lot of people praising Green Day by saying, \\"BILLIE JOE IZ SUH A GOOD MUESICIAN!!! TRE COOL IZ A BETTA DRUMMAR DAN LARS ULRICH!!!\\" Enough already! Billie Joe Armstrong was an annoying vocalist(still is now) and his guitar work was 3 chords at best. His solos were sloppy too. Tre Cool was a mediocre drummer. He just wasn't original. And Mike Dirnt, you couldn't even hear that freaking bass! People praise this album saying that it saved punk. WRONG!!! It only made it worse and couldn't compare to The Ramones or The Misfits(Danzig). So in conclusion this is a very overrated album that should be avoided!
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Quite good acting and real locations really takes you there.
B000062YB1|5.0|Slayer never seem to quit and they once again release an awesome album with the superb \\"seasons in the Abyss\\". This album is faster than \\"South of Heaven\\" but not as fast as \\"Reign in Blood\\". Still though this was one of the best metal albums of the 90s! Tom Araya sings more on this album than on his previous stuff but he's still great and his basslines are awesome too. Dave Lombardo is incredible at drumming. Kerry King and Jeff Hannaman are an incredible guitar team and the solos have more melody than before. My favorite songs are \\"War Ensemble\\", \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" and the title track which is after all the longest Slayer song ever (6:36)! Buy this album! It's not quite up to par with \\"Reign in Blood\\" but it's still superb!<br /><br />P.S. A note to Melissa: Shut the fu c k up you wh o r e!If you think that Travis Barker is better than Dave Lombardo than you should go to therapy! Your bands suck!
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Rise Against has done it yet again. I didn't think that they could top Siren Songs or Revolutions but in my book, this is their best CD to date. It shows growth both musically and lyrically, and is just plain fun to listen to. Here's a track breakdown.    1. Chamber the Cartridge: 4.8/5 Starts out with a bang. Perfect opener for the greatness that ensues. Not as good as State of the Union but still a fantastic song. Meaty, raw, and surprisingly fluid.    2. Injection: 4.9/5 This is a song that will definately grow on you with subsequent listens. The lyrics are fantastic, focusing on addiction.    3. Ready to Fall: 4.5/5 Their first single. I wasn't too into it at first but after about 5 listens it definately grew on me. Really heavy.    4. Bricks: 4.7/5 1:33 of raw freaking power. Reminds you of the Rise of old.    5. Under the Knife: 4.5/5 Another great song. Nothing that stands out too much, just a fantastic song throughout.    6. Prayer of the Refugee: 5/5 The song is so damn catchy it is scary. It starts out kind of lazily and then breaks into the chorus, which just obliterates the softness right before it. The vocal harmonizing during the last 20 seconds is amazing. Pry my second favorite song on the album.    7. Drones: 4.8/5 Starts out with a great beat and a fatty bass line. Again, the chorus just kills on this track. It is a perfect song for their concert. Great throughout.    8. The Approaching Curve: 3.5/5 This is the only song that really doesn't work on the CD. The lyrics are completely spoken except for the chorus. They seem forced and too melodramatic, like something you'd read in the first three paragraphs of a book. The chorus is fantastic but it cant save the song.     9. Worth Dying For: 5/5 This is my personal favorite and just an awesome song. It feels epic even though it is only three and a half minutes. The song structure is perfect and the music is infectious.    10. Behind Closed Doors: 4.3/5 Another consistantly catchy song. Nothing standsout too much but again, it is solid throughout.    11. Roadside: 4.7/5 Some RA fans might be turned off by this song but I really dig it. I guess it's the Swing Life Away of the album. Not being a fan of SLA I was reluctant to like this song seeing as it is somewhat of a soft song. The song writings fantastic and it is sung beautifully.    12. The Good Left Undone: 4.9/5 Catchy catchy bo betchy, banana fana fo fetchy.     13. Survive: 4.8/5 Great closer. Epic in scope and a nice way to close it out.    Although I bought the CD today, I downloaded it a few weeks ago so I've had a chance to listen to it around 40 times. The songs grow on you with subsequent listens so if you aren't feeling it at first listen to it a few more times. Overall, it is an amazing CD and I can't wait to see them perform it live.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|After viewing the movie for around the 12 time already, I cannot say that I am surprised by the stream of 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon. This movie is just amazing, and definitely marked a new level of stardom for the main characters. Bravo Mr. Ang Lee, and everyone in this movie. Keep up the good work.
B000001IPL|5.0|this has got to be the offspring's best album ever! with the classics \\"come out and play\\", and \\"self esteem\\" this IS a classic! \\"gotta get away\\", \\"bad habit\\", and \\"nitro (youth energy)\\" are a couple more of the great songs on this CD. so if you're thinking about listening to any of the offspring's albums - this should definetly be your first choice! the songs in the beginning are better than the ways later on the album.    time to relax: 10/10 just a good intro, because you have no clue what to expect next!  nitro (youth energy): 10/10 awesome drum roll in the beginning! and it has a great sound - and tone!  bad habit: 10/10 some of dexter's clever lyrics about how lame *ss drivers tick him off!  gotta get away: 10/10 awesome song! great vocals, guitars - etc.!  genocide: 8/10 yeah a good song, i guess it can grow on you  something to beleive in: 7/10 not the best song. it just has a wierd sound.  come out and play (keep 'em seperated): 10/10 holy [...] - the best offspring song ever! the lyrics are so true. and the beat and rythmn MAKE you like the song - and the guitar riffs make the song fun.  self esteem: 10/10 another one of their greats! the bassline makes the song 20 times better - and it's hard to just not like the song!  it'll be a long time: 7/10 not the best.  killboy powerhead: 9/10 i just like the song overall.  what happened to you?: 6/10 to me this is one of those songs i'll probably only listen to once or twice my whole life...i don't think the ska thing is working that great for them...  so alone: 7/10 nothing really hits me about this song.  not the one: 7/10 same.  smash: 10/10 one of my personal favorites, because...for whatever reason - i honestly do not know...
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is a beautiful CD and an amazing tribute to JRC - if there is an American VI don't let it detract from the amazing work that JRC and you did on the others and particularly American V. I'm overwhelmed by the sound of a man who has lost the love of his life and knows that his demise is imminent. The rawness and resignation in his voice says it all. What an amazing artist.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|the offspring has completely changed compared to their older albums (smash, the offspring, ignition), but this is a good CD still. but \\"pretty fly (for a white guy)\\", and \\"why don't you get a job?\\", in my opinion kill it! i mean \\"pretty fly\\" can be a good song - but if you heard the offspring before like i did - you would reject them for awhile! <br /> <br />welcome: 10/10 i don't really know why though <br />have you ever: 9/10 two part song - i think the second part is better <br />staring at the sun: 7/10 not a favorite. i get bored of it really easily. <br />pretty fly (fly for a white guy): 7/10 okay i guess, but a sell-out <br />the kids aren't alright: 10/10 awesome song! the intro is just fricken' awesome - and there's just so much truth to the song! real fun to play on guitar! <br />feelings: 7/10 once again not a favorite...little emo. <br />she's got issues: 10/10 one of the better songs on the album. <br />walla walla: 10/10 good speed and good lyrics <br />the end of the line: 8/10 good song, but it just doesn't hit me as a great one, but it also has good lyrics. <br />no breaks: 9/10 the chorus draws you to listen to the song <br />why don't you get a job?: 5/10 good lyrics - but to me the ska they have to it kinda make it sound like: what the f***? but nothing against ska - trust me! <br />americana: 10/10 i like the intro to this one too. the overall song has a great sound and tone. the lyrics are awesome. <br />pay the man: 10/10 once again the intro wins it over for me! but when the song actually starts, it has a good sound to it. <br /> <br />so overall, good CD, but if you want to hear the genuine offspring, listen to: the offspring, ignition, and smash! <br />
B000F3AAUW|4.0|I wasn't feelin this album on my first couple of listens, but suddenly I found my self listening to it back, to back, to back. There's still about 2 tracks that are just...ok. But overall I'm glad I made the purchase.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I had never seen the Broadway musical but I was always in love with the soundtrack and the storyline.  The movie, although not an EXACT telling of the Broadway story, is a great way of getting to know the characters, plot, music, etc.  I love that the original actors are in the cast.  Definitely watch it! :)
B000F7CMRM|1.0|Do us all a favor and take this movie off the market, it's not worth your money nor your time.  The acting is stilted, and the plot, well I don't think I can really tell you much about this disjointed plot, but I agree it's about oil and it's another stab at everybodys kicking aid, the CIA.  I went straight from watching this bomb to my son's room to tell him he had another movie he could sell.

B000001EIA|5.0|THE BAND: Paul Stanley (guitars), Gene Simmons (bass), Ace Frehley (guitars), Bruce Kulick (guitars), Peter Criss (drums), Eric Singer (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1996) 15 tracks clocking in at just under 57 minutes. Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout containing band pictures, song titles/credits, and thank you's. There is a rare Japanese version of this recording with added tracks and multiple takes of the same songs. An \\"MTV-Unplugged\\" production (location is not mentioned on the disc or liner notes). Label - Mercury.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Awesome recording by a band clearly with their best days behind them. Being a long time Kiss fan from the 70's, it was a real treat to see Ace and Peter up on stage with Paul and Gene... and from my perspective, looking like everyone was getting along and having some fun. Not to mention a great track list, crisp sound, an enthusiastic audience, and a band that can still perform live. Paul and Gene's voices still sound great after all these years. The guitars (electric and acoustic) sound like they're being played right in front of you - you can feel the fingers on the strings and the strumming guitar picks bending. Highlights for me included the Kiss staples (R&R All Nite\\", \\"Nothin' To Lose\\", \\"Rock Bottom\\", etc) and more importantly some of the lesser known songs that you didn't hear 'live' on their first 3 live albums, like \\"Comin' Home\\", \\"Plaster Caster\\", \\"A World Without Heroes\\" and \\"2000 Man\\". A great live recording - my 2nd favorite from Kiss behind the classic '75 \\"Alive!\\". Look for the DVD of the same MTV-Unplugged show - also a classic. This disc is absolutely essential to the Kiss collection (4.5 stars).
B000002IZM|5.0|Ridley Scott's ground breaking movie Blade Runner has been widely acclaimed by innumerable sources as the best science fiction movie ever made. While that position can be argued on many different levels, nobody can deny that the movie has an unmistakable ambience; one that is both believable and that has a depth few movies of any genre manage to attain. A key element in creating this depth is the stunning soundtrack written and performed by the incomparable Vangelis.<br /><br />On one level, Vangelis has written music that works perfectly with the themes of the movie and helps to propel the story line. The music is beautiful, poignant, exciting and mysterious. Each passage fits so well within the context of the movie.<br /><br />On a grander scale, he managed to dissect the society in which this story takes place to create a musical backdrop that is rich with multi-cultural references and styles. With his music, Vangelis has filled in the cracks of this world, providing us with a m&eacute;lange of aural textures and nuances that make this imaginary place seem real in every way. Just as you cannot walk down the street of any city without hearing a variety of songs, noises, languages and dialects, so too does this soundtrack provide a mixture of seemingly random, yet unified passages that make this world complete. Scott and Vangelis could have easily ignored these extra layers of detail and have told the story just as well, but by including the detail, they made a masterpiece.<br /><br />This is my favorite soundtrack and among my favorite CD's of all time. I highly recommend it to anybody even remotely interested in the work of Vangelis or the movie.  Now here is the real challenge for collectors - Thanks to my very good friend Chris (Thank you, a hundred times thank you!) I'm privileged to own a very rare copy of the Esper Production double CD package that includes a much more comprehensive collection of the music from this movie. If you ever see or have the opportunity to purchase this extended version, complete with much more dialog, sound effects and incidental passages than the official \\"sanctioned\\" soundtrack, snatch it up at any price. You won't be sorry.

0767827902|5.0|This is one of the most important American films ever made, and it is entertaining as well. Everyone who is interested in film beyond just being titilated or receiving self-centered gratification should see this film. It is artful, cinematographically important, and explores characters and an American way of life which is dying or dead.
B00005JP0A|2.0|Wow, I don't know what's worse: the fact that Hollywood keeps on making lousy movies, the fact that people keep watching them, or the fact they get 4-star and 5-star ratings.  \\"The Godfather\\" is a 5-star movie; \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" is a 4-star movie.  This is 2-star material, 3 if you're being generous.    The movie wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have a predictable plot, lousy acting (aside from Streep's successful portrayal of a nasty boss, but who needs an actor to do that?), and a 2-hour plus running time.  Our heroine realizes that the life of fashion isn't exactly what she wanted, and she eventually loses touch with her friends, so she throws away the glitz and glamor for her old life.  The end.  Amazingly insightful.  Too bad we've seen this a million times.    I haven't seen a movie in over 2 years, and after this one I remembered why I stopped.  You go home with a good feeling in your tummy because you saw a happy ending, but at the same time you feel like you totally got ripped off by a mediocre movie with nothing special going for it.  Save your money and wait 'til this one comes out on HBO if you're dying to see it.
B000002HK4|5.0|A Change of Seasons was the EP Dream Theater released in 1995 after their third album, the excellent Awake.  The song itself had first been written in 1989 and played live a few times but never finished off and recorded until this EP.  The song itself is 23 minutes of epic Dream Theater and runs the gamut from acoustic instrumentation to full on metal and prog and everything in between.  The overriding theme of the song, lyrics written by Mike Portnoy about his mother's death, is the cycle of life as told through the seasons, and to live life with the motto Carpe Diem (sieze the day).  It's a powerful, just amazing song that is one of the highpoints in DT's long, illustrious career. <br />The other 4 songs on the EP are taken from DT's famous \\"Uncovered\\" show in London in 1995 where they played 2 hours of their favorite covers. While inessential, they are FUN as hell to listen to.  Elton John's Funeral For a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Deep Purple's Perfect Strangers, a Led Zep medley and a Big Medley containing songs by Pink Floyd, Journey, Kansas, and others, it's all fun and enjoyable. But get this EP for the title track...it's WELL worth it!!
B00005JOSU|5.0|There IS a quality to \\"The Lake House\\" that lingers in the mind days afterward. <br /> <br />For a film in which the element of Time is uniquely important, \\"The Lake House\\" manages to convey an odd sense of universal timelessness.  It as though the specific When is less relevant than the universality of human thought, feeling, and decision.  An almost mystical quality. <br /> <br />\\"The Lake House\\" is that rare film which not only invites but welcomes a repeat viewing.  The first time simply follow What happens in the story.  See the film again to more fully enjoy How this story elegantly unfolds. <br /> <br />This is NOT a time travel film.  Repeat, NOT.  Each character in this film experiences only his or her own natural time moving forward in the usual linear chronological way.  What changes is each character's perspective on what they are experiencing over time, and how each's perception of their Past informs Present decisions which impact Future events. <br /> <br />If I had to pick one theme to describe this picture:  at the time they occur, we may not even recognize the most important encounters or events in our lives. <br /> <br /> <br />Alex (Keanu Reeves) and Kate (Sandra Bullock) are two seemingly unconnected persons who have lived in the lake house of the title - exactly two years apart.  Through seeming accident they find that they can communicate with each other directly, in immediate personally experienced time, through the mysterious mailbox at the lake house.  We then follow the often startling events each experiences - and writes about to the other - over the next two years of their lives, Alex from February of 2004 to 2006, Kate from February 2006 to 2008.  The result is . . . an extraordinary film that both satisfies the intellect and engages on a surprisingly emotional level. <br /> <br />Their roles here are a significant departure from usual for both Reeves and Bullock, but not to worry.  Individually, this is either's best work anywhere.  Collectively, their chemistry is exceptional.  Subplots in the story are developed through some superb supporting performances, most notably the two parents.  Christopher Plummer is achingly brilliant as Alex' demanding genius architect father, and Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooy positively oozes wit and warmth as Kate's mother. <br /> <br />The lake house itself . . . physically brings out so much emotional subtext in this film that it ought to be credited as a separate character.  (If no artist/architect has actually built this house, they should!) <br /> <br />Altogether, \\"The Lake House\\" is one of most rewarding films of any type I have seen in many years. <br /> <br />HIGHLY recommended. <br />
0688156819|5.0|This is just the style of art I like. This book fits in perfectly with my Roman Dirge and Jhonen collection. Definitely something to read if you're a morbid person. The poetry is a little lacking, but it is made up for in the fantastic artwork.
B000000OSE|3.0|After the huge success of \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" back in 1987, Guns N' Roses decided to change their sound and release a two part album containing a variety of different songs and a couple of really good cover tracks by Dylan and McCartney.  The band also took on keyboardist Dizzy Reed in order to further divert from their previous sound who performed on a number of tracks.    First of all, lets start with the good tracks:  \\"November Rain\\" which is an absolutely exceptional ballad and a personal favourite of mine from this album and a favourite song period.  This is a truly floorless song; everything about it boasts sophistication and great musicianship from the introduction to Axl's vocal work, (which really work well) to slash's 3 masterpiece guitar solos and beautifully written lyrics and piano work by Axl to the drumming and basslines that compliment the song well, \\"Right Next Door To Hell\\" which is a powerful album opener, live and let die (the McCartney cover), \\"don't cry\\" another great ballad to which November rain is its sequel and \\"Back Off Bitch\\" a real straight up angry song about relationship problems or whatever.      Then there are the average songs i.e. \\"Dust N' Bones2, Double Talking Jive (good guitar solo) and \\"Coma\\" which despite the musical content being good drags on for a bit and for me a 10 minute song has to be more accessible than that.    There are then the plain poor songs such as \\"perfect crime\\" \\"Don't Damn Me\\", \\"Dead Horse\\" and \\"Bad Apples\\" which is easily the worst song on the album and the 2nd worst song Guns N' Roses have ever written after \\"My World\\" on illusions part 2.      The fact that a fair few of the songs are bad or ok isn't the only thing that lest this album down, due to the order of the tracks, the general flow of the album can be really quite tedious as you are left patiently listening to a string of bad songs (some of which are quite long) before you finally reach a good one.  The best example of this is the beginningof the CD:  Right Next Door To Hell - good CD opener, followed by:  Dust N' Bones - an average song, the momentum is then picked up again by \\"Live and Let Die\\" followed by \\"Don't cry\\" which his another good song, but then the contrast between don't cry and \\"Perfect Crime\\" the following song is a bit of a smack in the face, up next is \\"You Aint The first\\" (another bad song) bad obsession is then up next which is ok but not good enough to compensate for the other two songs.    The album continuous to go through the same pattern of good songs being sandwiched by bad songs until the end of the album which finishes with coma which for a closing track as already mentioned is too long and requires a lot of patience.    Apart from the bad songs and the flow of the CD, this album is definitely worth buying just for the good songs.  If you are new to Guns N' Roses music, I suggest you start off with \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" by far their best Album and one of the greatest CD's in the history of music in my opinion.
B000F0UV0E|3.0|emmy lou and mark are a perfect compliment to one another. should win awards for best mixed duo.
B000E97X66|5.0|Had this album been released back in 1975 or 1976, this very well might have been as significant as, say, Kiss \\"Alive\\" or the Who's \\"Live At Leeds.\\"  <br />In the first case, THAT album brought a worldwide audience to a group with only three previous, poor-to-average sales. This would have done the same. <br />As in the second case, it demonstrates a whole new, but unbelievably powerful side to a performer mostly known for their studio work. <br />Simply put, this album shows that Bruce and The E Street Band were easily among the best live performers of the day. And now, thirty years on, it shows that they're amongst the best ever. <br />There is energy here that would shame the most hyperactive punk rocker. <br />There is musicianship here that would impress any elitist jazz critic. <br />There is drama here that would astonish any modern day film student. Yes, film. These performances play in your head like film. They're vivid, detailed. They have plot and characters. There's suspense and comedy. <br />This is the real deal, the whole magillah. This is an unbelievably satisfying listening experience. <br /> <br />The best thing about the record, besides the fact that such a well recorded document from such a legendary show even exists, is that we Bruce fans can hear the band tear through songs from the \\"Born To Run\\" album like we've never heard them before. <br /> <br />\\"Born To Run\\" is not a career highpoint yet, it's a call to arms. <br />My God...\\"She's The One\\" is a hurtling freight train, out of control; loud, fast and loose. It's thrilling. <br />The band isn't playing songs they've played a thousand times before. They are finding their way through new sounds and tempos and textures. All that creative energy comes RIGHT through your speakers. <br /> <br />Listen to Clarence's sax breaks...they're fresh and explosive. <br />Listen to Roy Bittan's piano...masterful chord works with finger-knotting flourishes. <br />Hear Miami Steve wailing along, dueling withthe Boss himself on call-and-response guitar solos as if the two of them are facing off in an alley with knives in a gangfight. <br />Has Max Weinberg ever been as clean and crisp, yet at the same time thundering like no other? <br /> <br />The set list is a dream. Getting the Detroit medley and a rollicking \\"Quarter to Three\\" to end the show is a treat for rock fans, not just Bruce fans. \\"Thunder Road\\" regains its' poetry. \\"Jungleland\\" retains its' epic, widescreen quality. \\"Rosalita\\" remains a full-on party, as does an early-in-the-show \\"Tenth Avenue.\\" <br /> <br />I think it's fine that this is available on video AND audio. I will probably listen to this more than I will re-visit the DVD, but they are BOTH nice to have. <br /> <br />And for a pathologic Bruce fan like myself, essential.
B00030590I|5.0|\\"Hero\\" is another visually amazing film from Asia. The entire cast is excellent in this period-piece, but the beautiful scenery and choreography steal the film. From the mountains to the costumes, the film is just beautiful. The story is well written even though some things are predictable. Even though many films have been similar to this one, it still has something that makes it it's own. Some of the things in this film I have never seen any where else. If you love recent martial arts films, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out. It's as good as it looks
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|It seems like this film has either been poorly edited or shot  in quite a hurry, because the story plot is not developed well enough. Things happen too brusquely. It has a beautiful photography, though, interesting scenes and characterizations. But it needed more minutes. I want to believe that it wasn't Ford's intention to tell the story this way, but the film is failed nontheless.<br /><br />I can't help compare it to Hawks' Hatari (great classic) or Huston's African Queen (good) or many other great directors take on the African splendors.<br /><br />As a homage to the best director in film histoy, John Ford, it is a mandatory film to be watched, and respected as what it could have really been, another great classic.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a good CD.  There's no other way to put it.  The songs are varied and flow easily from one to another, despite some of the huge differences in the types of sound used.  From acoustic guitar to the turntable effects Incubus is famous for, this album has it all.  It's a great place to start for new Incubus fans, or those who have tired of the onslaught of \\"Drive\\" and their newer albums. <br /> <br />The introspective, brooding sound of \\"Mexico\\" is a sure highlight along with the surprisingly philosophical \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" that caps the album.  The classic Incubus sound that we have all heard is present as well in \\"Nice to Know You\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"  The variety of sound and the skillful song writing earn this album its five stars.
0393327655|2.0|Ever since the tragedy of September 11, it seems as though our world has changed. Indeed, at the time, some commentators predicted that very thing. It was only a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and we were just getting used to the idea that our lives and our civilization might endure, after all. Now, once again, we seem to be threatened by catastrophe--man-made catastrophe, by people who see us as evil, who blame us for their problems. Our conflict with the Soviet Union was a rivalry between two economic philosophies. This time it appears to be about religion. <br /> <br />Soon after that September 11, Sam Harris began writing a book describing what he saw as the root of the conflict. His book, The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason, claims that religious belief is the source of much of the violence in the world, past and present. He is currently studying the neurological aspects of belief in the human brain. <br /> <br />As an extreme example of the damaging and dangerous beliefs threatening civilization, he begins his book with an account of a Palestinian suicide bomber blowing himself up on an Israeli bus crowded with civilians. Because the man was taught to believe that by martyring himself while killing \\"the enemy,\\" he will go immediately to heaven, an everlasting paradise filled with pleasure, and the other people he has killed will go to their rightful end in hell. It's the belief, Harris says, that impels such awful (for the rest of us) behavior. \\"Your beliefs,\\" he says, \\"define your vision of the world; they dictate your behavior; they determine your emotional responses to other human beings.\\" <br /> <br />While his book focuses mainly upon what he sees as the most immediate threat, extremist Islam, he claims that fundamentalist Christianity, too, prevents society from realizing its potential for progress and peace. That's because both religions are based upon beliefs that may have been appropriate for the times when theybegan, but in the light of modern science can no longer be depended upon to shape our cultural values and institutions. He argues that we must face that fact and confront expressions of belief when they contradict what we now know about the world and its history. <br /> <br />Conflicts between science and religious beliefs are not new. As Ken Wilber points out in his book The Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion, Galileo put his life at risk when he looked through a telescope and proclaimed that the earth revolved around the sun, rather than the other way around as stated by the church. Because, according to calculations based upon biblical accounts the beginning of the world occurred about six thousand years ago, education in this country has been subject to loud and sustained debate about the validity of evolutionary theories that fix the beginning of the earth at billions of years earlier. Both Harris and Wilber (and thousands of other scientists) agree that beliefs that do not recognize the systematic discoveries of science are not productive to \\"progress\\" in the modern world, and would be better discarded. <br /> <br />Wilber, however, acknowledges the personal benefits that people get from their religious faiths--indeed, the benefits that accrue to the society from the connections many people feel with the Kosmos through their faith. His book is an attempt to find a way to integrate religion and science without violating the core values of either. He says that science, in its initial discoveries, helped to differentiate the separate realms of knowledge: objective (empirical), subjective (personal) and moral (interpersonal). In Platonic terms these realms are: the true, the beautiful and the good. Paradoxically, science then tended to deny the validity of subjective and moral truths. <br /> <br />It was the rapid growth of empirical science and the huge amount of practical knowledge that it gave to people, that bestowed its great power.And with that power, science tended to claim that it alone possessed the ability to determine all truth. In the grand days of the Enlightenment (about the time that our country was founded), many people were beginning to believe that science could answer all our questions. Not only that, but the kinds of questions that science could not answer (such as those having to do with consciousness and spirituality) were not real. What is not measurable simply does not exist. <br /> <br />From Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, positivism is a philosophy developed by Auguste Comte in the beginning of the nineteenth century, which stated that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge. This view is sometimes referred to as scientism. Positivism soon eclipsed the other realms of knowledge and drove a wedge between those who believed its tenets and those who believed in teleology: that there is an underlying purpose to anything that we can discover about the world through empiricle science. This debate, of course, is at the heart of the current discussions about evolution. <br /> <br />As positivism grew in Western culture, so did its antithesis: Christian revivalism. Protestant fundamentalism relied on a belief in the literal truth of biblical scripture. That is what Sam Harris has taken to task in his book. \\"Most of the people in the world,\\" he states, \\"believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book.\\" He doesn't give his source for such an assertion. In other places, he quotes liberally from polls and other research, but here he supplies none. It seems simply his belief. <br /> <br />In fact, it is his tendency to make such outrageous generalizations that arouses my own skepticism. \\"All [revealed religions] are in perverse agreement on one point of fundamental importance . . .: `respect' for other faiths, or for the views of unbelievers, is not an attitude that God endorses. . . . Intolerance is thus intrinsic to every creed.\\"  <br /> <br />I grew up in a Baptist home. I wouldn't call it an especially pious household, even though my father was at one time an assistant pastor, and was a Mason. As I gradually was able to compare our religious beliefs with those of other children I associated with in our conservative Midwest city, I did not feel particularly different from the typical classmate I shared with. We had our biases and prejudices against anyone \\"different,\\" but my parents taught us that tolerance was a virtue. As I remember now, the most outspoken dislike expressed at home was against those who preached hate. Perhaps that early training is the source of my reaction to books such as The End of Faith. Certainly, my adult life has been one of accumulating an increasingly liberal view of humanity and societies. <br /> <br />Harris states in his first chapter that \\"One of the central themes of this book . . . is that religious moderates are themselves the bearers of a terrible dogma: they imagine that the path to peace will be paved once each of us has learned to respect the unjustified beliefs of others.\\"  <br /> <br />I could read that, I suppose, the same way I read a poster on the wall of one of my early classrooms that said, \\"Americans should be intolerant only of intolerance.\\" That slogan, paradoxical as it was, was consistent with what I learned to believe in my own home, that hate and intolerance were evil. If Harris were more specific in his caution against respecting \\"unjustified beliefs\\" to sort out what is detrimental to civilization from what is merely perhaps misguided, then I might respect his views more. <br /> <br />It also seems to me that he is misjudging the relative power of individual belief versus that of local culture. I don't see the millions of Muslims in this country calling for jihad. I don't see millions of Fundamentalist Christians in this country bombing abortion clinics or picketing schools, calling for the abolition of the teaching of evolution. Culture is a melting pot; in afree society, culture changes slowly, and it changes in the direction of tolerance unless it is gripped by the kind of fear that he expresses. <br /> <br />I happen to believe that Sam Harris's polemic will cause more violence, not less; that his insistence on the philosophy of positivism does nothing to clarify the distinction among the true, the good and the beautiful--as Ken Wilber so persuasively points out; and that by expressing his belief that most people are slaves to their professed beliefs he is simply adding fuel to the flames of distrust and hope for a peaceful world. <br /> <br />Sam Harris, it seems to me, is afraid. His fear could be turned toward ways of mitigating the real roots of conflict in the world--lack of knoweldge of other people and distrust of anything \\"different\\"--that prevent us from seeing our world as the miracle it is. Instead, he is proclaiming his own--to me misguided and dangerous--belief that other people's beliefs are carved in stone. I, for one, stand as a modest example of a person who used to believe in a lot of things that I no longer accept. My changing values and beliefs are products of a safe environment where I was free to explore alternatives to those of my forebearers. Freedom, to me, nurtures broad thinking, and is the soil in which peace grows. Fear is a product of a closed mind.
B000002MM8|5.0|Back in 1993 I came home late one night from a party.  I turned on the tube and there was the video for \\"Yulunga\\", on MTV!  My jaw was hanging down to the floor.  The next day I woke up and the first thought I had was to hear the rest of this album.  Strangely enough, the c.d. was available and in the store.   <br /> <br />I don't have any review about this music, but I can say that it ,for me, creates an atmosphere thats...blah...blah...blah (I don't know). <br /> <br />If your in need of a new music, I really hope you try this album.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|Disney got it right with their re-telling of the Mulan legend. It's a far better historical drama than Pocahontas, less dependant on fluff than Hercules, no sugary songs to clear the gloom like in Hunchback, and more of an original concept than the recycled Tarzan. And for what it's worth from a Chinese person's perspective, the stereotypes aren't too bad. Sidekicks are a little cheesy, but the main characters are handled well.<br /><br />All this makes for a rocking good time with Mulan. You get a truly independent and proactive female lead, and a genie-like character in Eddie Murphy's Mushu. There's actually a nice sense of danger and tension in the mountain scenes, with some excellent computer work to show a huge invading army. The villain's less memorable here, but he's pure evil without remorse, and there are tastefully handled offscreen deaths to show he isn't kidding around (hey, it's a war story). Fun songs keep the movie light where appropriate, and the whole project has a -slightly- more mature edge while remaining strictly Disney and family-friendly.<br /><br />Great collection of extras in this set, including some deleted material, the original Christina Aguilera music video, and behind-the-scenes stuff. Also of interest is a Jackie Chan music video from the overseas promotions. The guy's English may not be so great, but he sings all the ending themes to his own movies in Hong Kong, and has a good voice when he's in his element.<br /><br />Definitely one of my top five favourite Disney films, and a solid buy for any family or animation lover's library.
B000ENC6XM|5.0|Concerning the HD DVD Version.It' doesn't look any better than the regular dvd so unless the extras are worth it to you i wouldn't bother spending extra. <br />Pretty disappointed.
B00005JL96|5.0|Disney began to experiment with their animated films in the early 2000s, shying from the traditional musicals and picking projects which were offbeat. Lilo and Stitch was probably their biggest success (followed closely by Emperor's New Groove). It's a film about the meaning of family and acceptance, set in beautiful Hawaii with two very offbeat leads: a monster with a violent streak and a kid that doesn't fit the 'barbie' mode of previous leads. They have great chemistry, and it's so fun watching them in action that Disney eventually did some decent sequels and a tv series.<br /><br />At this point I keep hearing rumours of a 2-disc Lilo and Stitch edition, not sure if it's coming or when. It's been released in other regions, and among other things contains the original plane sequence that was altered after the 9/11 tragedy. If you're looking for something for the kids this single disc already has good audio/video and some nice bonuses, but animation buffs should keep their eyes out to see if the 2-disc will be announced soon.<br /><br />A great Disney effort, worth the buy if you haven't tried it already.
B00005JL78|4.0|I loved Minority Report, <br />a clever story and amazing special effects made for a great futuristic experience. I watched this movie many times now, and it never ceased to grab my attention.
0380789035|4.0|I just finished reading Neil Gaiman's American Gods. I'd already read Anansi Boys and thoroughly loved it so I was looking forward to this one. I suppose I did it backwards since AB was kind of a sequel to AG - wasn't it? If that's the case then it wasn't to disconcerting. The only character that I can recall being in both stories was Anansi himself. But I really enjoyed it. Wasn't as fun and uplifting as AB. More on the dark and heavy side. (Unworshipped, has-been gods are as sad and pathetic as old has-been rockstars, who'd have thought?) But it was well-developed and thorougly researched. In fact NG seems to have gone to great pains to use lesser known figures from european and african mythology. He even breaks up the telling of the story to tell us some of the things he found through stories of the gods coming to America. And all of it I found believable. However, the discovery about Shadow's background wasn't really that surprising. And Laura's purpose wasn't that clear to me. I would have liked to have seen a bibliography that he used included in the book - that would have been cool. But overall, it was an excellent read.

B0006J28L4|5.0|This film is magical.  The writing and directing capture the complexities and dynamics of Malcolm's progress.  It is almost as if Spike Lee lets the camera run on a condensed version of Malcolm's life.  We see and understand his conversion from pimp to racist to social critique and leader.  More imporantly, we see how his own life is a metaphor for his teaching: that once the oppressed understand what is holding them down, they are free to flourish.   <br /> <br />Perhaps even more amazing than the writing (which closely alligns with Malcolm's autobiograhy) and the directing is Denzel Washington's performance.  It may be the best acting in the history of American film.  Lee often spliced into the film historical footage of X, yet it requires close discernment of physical characteristics to realize we still aren't watching Denzel.   <br /> <br />While lamenting on the systematic yet subtle exploitation of blacks, Malcolm often pointed to the black mindset as the culprit for the rampant poverty, crime, and ignorance in the black community.   <br />Overt racism and institutionalized drawbacks were hard enough for black people to overcome.  But worse yet, Malcolm noted, was the psychological prison that enslaved blacks in a quagmire of abasement, escapism, and an inclination of deference.  Malcolm proclaimed that to release the human potential of the black man, he must first accept who he is, and more importantly be proud of his color.   <br /> <br />This is the importance of Malcolm X: from his life (and legend)propagated the concept of black pride.  Indeed, Malcolm preached that in order for black people to gain respect, they must first develop respect for themselves.  In fact, self-respect was the only thing important. From the era of slavery onward, whites had imbued blacks with an inferiority complex to keep them docile and subserveant. It was time for Blacks to learn about their own heritage without White spin, time for Blacks to recognize their own capabilities for greatness, time for Blacks to rise from the depths of the  mudsill class.  And, as Malcolm warned, if the exploiters got in the way, the \\"keg of blackpowder is going to explode and blow the house up.\\"   <br /> <br />What is even more admirable is his openness to change.  By the end of his life, Malcolm overcame his racism and strived for the realization of human dignity for all people. Like King, when Malcolm demanded equality for all, the FBI's communist sensors went off and X was summarily assassinated.   <br />

B00005JOQS|5.0|I actually hadn't planned on seeing this film these holidays. After being bored throughout the \\"Spiderman\\" movies and disappointed in the latest \\"X-men\\" I wasn't confident that \\"Superman Returns\\" could break the ice. But how very wrong I turned out to be. On a spur of the moment, I decided to see it, and it was certainly the highlight of my day. <br /> <br />After five long years, Superman, played by newcomer Brandon Routh, returns to Earth. But during his absence, the private life he once knew and led has changed for the worst. His lady love, Lois Lane, played by a brunette Kate Bosworth, appears to have moved on with a job promotion, a new man... and a son. On top of all that, she is an Anti-Superman activist, whose claim to fame was brought on by her negative article that slammed the man of steel's mission to save. As it happens however, old flames never truly die, and as nemisis Lex Lurther attempts to destroy him and all the world, Lois and Superman's poignant love affair survives. <br /> <br />To me, \\"Superman Returns\\" had everything it needed to make it a great superhero film - a great cast, believable chemistry between the two love interests, detestable and comical enemies, a slightly dodgy and predictable script, and, most importantly, fantastic special effects. <br /> <br />I thought Brandon Routh's casting as Superman was spot-on. Like Tobey McGuire was to Spiderman, Routh's relitive unknown name meant we had no prejudices going into the film. I think he played Superman's calm, yet alert and deeply engaged character beautifully. Kate Bosworth was charming as the stubborn, yet fragile Lois, and the relationship between the two characters was very touching. Their iconic flight over New York City, I thought, was particularly lovely. I also loved how their love was portrayed only subtely in the physical sense, making their emotional connection that much stronger and believable.  <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey's portrayal as ravenous Lex Luther was good, if not a little stationary. I think he was the weakest in this film, along with his lady assistant Kitty, played by Parker Posey, who I must admit, just annoyed me! But these flaws did little to supress my enjoyment of the film.  <br /> <br />The special effects in this film were fabulous, though not quite \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" With the film's somewhat ordinary and predictable script, the special effects were the essential ingredient that ensured the success of this movie. In particular I want to mention the simply exhilerating scene with the aeroplane. I shaln't delve too deeply into details, but it was quite honestly the best part of the film, and had me utterly rivetted! Come Oscar time, I should definately look for \\"Superman\\" to have gongs in this field. <br /> <br />All in all, I entered the cinema expecting an average flick and came out with a grin on my face. With enough action packed in and the right dosage of emotion, \\"Superman Retuns\\" was a thrill ride adventure that I enjoyed from explosive beginning to heartwarming end. Superman saves the day again!
B00065MDSG|5.0|Along with Islands and Starless and Bible Black(see my review) this is the absolute peak of King Crimson. In 1972 King Crimson (the Peter Sinfield era) completely dissintegrated after a disasterous tour that produced the subpar live album Earthbound. Many believed this to be the end of King Crimson. However this was not the case a year later Larks Tongues in Aspic was released to the world and what an album it is. Completely departing from Crimsons former somber symphonic style, Lark's is an avant garde masterpiece that is absolutely drenched in darkness as well as beauty. Kicking off with the blueprint to every extended instrumental King Crimson has done since is LTIA part 1. This song show Fripps new found approach to songwriting, slowly building tension that ends with an explosive climax. The entire song is a roller coaster of sounds ranging from David Cross's beautiful(and more than a little sinister) violin soloes to Fripps Sabbathesque guitar passages, this song is more than a little strange. Even stranger is the fact that the song is followed up by a short ballad(Book Of Saturdays) that is the complete musical oppisite of the opening song. Exiles follows and is the second best song off the album. This song like the last song is a wonderful ballad driven by violin, mellotron, and Fripps acoustic guitar. John Wetton does a great job with the vocals. Easy Money is a fantastic rocker loaded with distortion and a great solo from Fripp. The Talking Drum is pretty much just an extended intro for the final song on the album but its a great build up. The closing song is LTIA part 2 which in my humble opinion is King Crimsons best instrumental. Alternating between heavy distorted passages and an absolutely awe inspiring interlude, this song is the reason i bought the album. <br />The musicianship on this album is top notch with all the players being virtuoso's at their instruments you would not expect the playing to be as tight as it is as tight as it is but in fact for an album that was part improvised this is some of the tightest group interplay I have ever heard. Wetton also does a great job at singing in the very few spots on this album that have vocals. Overall this is one of the greatest albums ever made and deserves to be in any serious music collection. This album is the very definition of Progressive.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This was a much anticipated movie. A long time coming but worth the weight. From the FF7 flashbacks to the follow up. A Great Movie I recommend this to anyone especially those who have enjoyed the game itself.
B000002BFZ|4.0|The most eccentric PJ cd. I love it personally. a lot of ups and downs. Aside from the last 2 tracks, this cd is beautiful. Especially the tracks : Hail, Hail, In my Tree,Red Mosquito and Present tense (which rules)... Great cd, but not in any particular genre. A sound and feel of its own. Love It!
B00003CWTI|2.0|I've dared to challenge my cinema-going art student friends and uni-mates, amid heated discussions about David Lynch, Akira Kurosawa and such, by confessing that I really didn't like Magnolia at all.  I feel that PT Anderson does indeed create well-rounded characters, compelling dialogue and stuff like that.  The actors cast in his movies always deliver brilliant performances - but in the end, I really felt Magnolia fell short of something more substantial.  It dragged on way too long, the extensive scenes never really seemed to go anywhere and I felt that some serious revisions and editing would have been most beneficial.  There were twists and diversions that didn't really add anything and overall I felt like it was a waste of time which is a shame because some of the scenes featured some great and inspiring acting but maybe they were misplaced.  It didn't really have the sort of message that I couldn't have gotten from a song or another movie in less time and all the symbollic, arty stuff came across as pretentious film-student stuff.  I think PT Anderson is highly overrated as a director and his films are way too self-indulgent.  I don't think he's very good at telling a story without going overboard and sending the viewer astray.  With the exception of the performances by Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise, I thought this film was terrible.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|You may find it boring at the beginning. However, you will be deeply moved at the end.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Everything about this is perfect. The wonderful cast, gorgeous songs, and the hidden plot makes this the absolute best broadway musical soundtrack I have ever heard. Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are both such wonderful women with such great vocal talent. So, if you so choose to buy this CD, you won't be disappointed!
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This is a great dissertation on how children in modern times have become callous and disrespectful to the point where the best way to deal with them is to let them fight to the death. In the broad strokes this movie is really a coming of age film about a boy who isn't one of those society deem worthless trying to find his way out of a horrible situation without losing his morality. Along the way he discovers friendship, love, responsibility, and self awareness as a child becoming an adult. All this taking place during a timed death match where the rules state that only one child can survive. Then there's also Japanese school girls with guns, so it's a great movie on a lot of levels. Beat Takashi doesn't make bad films so if he's in it you know its worth a watch.<br />The difference between the directors cut and the regular film is they added CGI blood sprays to some scenes, made some explosions bigger, and cleaned up the whole movie digitally so it looks better on high def tv's
B00000APLB|5.0|Awesome live album, for a long time my favorite live album by any group. The version of Sympathy and Get what you want is spectacular. Only down part of this album is the recording mix, album needs to be remastered to clean up sound. This live album better than flashpoint or stripped as far as overall performances but be careful on high quality sounds systems if you are into true clean sound.
B00006RAKP|5.0|In the 1970s, Sir Elton John's sound inmediately set him apart from most others by being piano-based in a rock'n'roll world dominated by guitars. Another early characteristic was a set of dynamic string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster. Coupled with Taupin's often opaque but emotionally resonant lyrics, the results were unique in the history of music. Songs in this style included \\"Sixty Years On\\", \\"Burn Down the Mission\\", \\"Take Me to the Pilot\\", \\"Levon\\", \\"Madman Across the Water\\", and the best-known of these, \\"Tiny Dancer\\".    \\"Your Song\\", one of his earliest popular hits, incorporates some other features found in many of his songs: It is in  binary form, with the verse repeated before the chorus begins; the piano accompaniment is prominent, though the song also features an orchestra; it uses a slowly building crescendo that brings the song to a tutti climax. Other songs that follow this pattern include \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me\\" and \\"Rocket Man\\".    Elton has been one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world since the 1970s. His success has had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock  & roll.    This compilation is the best opportunity to have a Sir Elton John's Masterpiece Performances so that I strongly recommend it.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Great acting, great music, and great movie.  It doesn't get much better than this movie or Reese Wittherspoon.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I purchased this set for my husband after hearing him talk about it for quite some time.  He is thrilled with it and plays it quite often.  It is apparently a 'Must Have' for any Springsteen fan.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I was slightly skeptical about how this album would turn out, ever since I learned of the plans to release it. I was worried it would be rushed, and full of doctored tracks that Johnny never finished. Turns out, Rick Rubin spent his time putting this album together. The production is once again sparse, but perfect, and the sequencing of the tracks is excellent. I really enjoy the guitar arrangements on this album, they seem to have just the right notes. Most of all, Johnny's voice, THE voice, strikes me more on this album than on the last American record. Some songs show him tired and weak, such as \\"like the 309\\", but even within these songs, Johnny finds the strength, and conveys emotion as powerful as ever. One of my favorite tracks on this record is \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\", a traditional composition. Johnny's voice sounds years younger, and he plows right through the song. At 1:09 in the song, Johnny sings a line \\" He called my name, and my heart stood still/when he said John, go do my will! \\" Johnny sings it with such a presence, it gave me a chill. Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" and Hank Williams' \\"On the Evening Train\\" are two more great renditions. Once again, as on other American records, Johnny makes the cover tunes into his own songs, as if they were written by or for him. I am completely content with this album, despite having initial misgivings a few months ago. I look forward to the release of any remaining recordings with more confidence after hearing this record. I recommend this record for those familiar with the American Recordings, or those who are big Cash fans. I don't think it's the best introduction to Johnny, I always recommend Live at Folsom Prison or Live at San Quentin as a good starting point for new fans. I must also say that the recently released \\"Personal Files\\" double disc set is excellent. It's all just Johnny and a guitar. the first song on the first disc, \\"The Letter Edged in Black\\" is brilliant. Much Respect to Johnny Cash, if there was a Mt. Rushmore for American musicians, Johnny should be the first one carved into it. May he rest in peace.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I am somewhat happy to hear that this movie was based on a game.  I am a 42 yr old father who LOVES horror movies.  I thought this movie was the pits.  Truly the pits.  I am shocked there have been any positive reviews.  It was not scary, not in the least.  The storyline didn't flow and there were large holes and things that just didn't make sense.  I heard audible sighs throughout the theater during the whole movie....and yes, some were coming from me.  Pass on this film.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The most striking difference between the previously released \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Let It Be... Naked\\" is with \\"Long and Winding Road.\\" Without the \\"Wall of sound\\" orchestration, it is a wonderfully gentler sound - pure and unadultrated. I quite enjoyed this CD.
1563890119|4.0|Preludes and Nocturnes is not my favorite Sandman volume, but it is definitely the one to read if you have never approached the series before. It's the first graphic novel in the series -- always a good place to start -- and it explains some of the origins and environs that will come to play in the later books. Preludes and Nocturnes is also deliciously weird, something Gaiman fans have come to expect and love. This delivers his snarky and allusive writing with tremendous art by several illustrators.<br /><br />I received this as a Christmas present one year, and I could not have been happier with the gift.
0060837020|5.0|'The Bell Jar' remains one of the best books ever written on depression, far better than say 'Prozac Nation' or 'She's Come Undone'. However, unless the reader has experienced depression firsthand, they may have difficulty relating to the protagonist. Those who criticize this book will always demand a rational reason for Ester's depression. This isn't very different from the way people act in real life. People who have never experienced depression firsthand fail to miss something: there isn't a rational reason for depression. In depression, the word 'rational' doesn't exist. It could be a cause of many things, often times being a chemical imbalance in the brain. Let's just say this: depression can happen to anyone. It doesn't matter if you're rich and privileged, successful, or loved. Depression is uncontrollable and it's not something a person can merely 'snap out of'.<br /><br />So what is it about 'The Bell Jar' that makes it superior to its imitators? Perhaps its the book's sense of humor. Whether talking about movies shot in Technicolor or 'scandal sheets' (aka: tabloids), society is viewed through a humorous yet almost sardonic-like telescope. The book is roughly edited, and the run-on sentences and random observations give it a more personal feel. To this day, 'The Bell Jar' remains a great testimonial on what depression feels like.
B00004VVNB|3.0|Its one of those scien fics movies i had to include in my collection.
0446310786|5.0|I love this book!  I read it once in middle school and decided to read it again after I saw the movie \\"Capote\\".  I enjoyed it so much the second time I went out and bought it so I could read it a third, fourth, and fifth time.<br /><br />Harper Lee inspires me as I become engrossed in her story of Maycomb and its most prominent resident, Atticus Finch, and his family in a time when life was harder and people less accepting.  With diversity and the mystery of Boo Radley weaved around the foundation of Atticus and his children Jem and Scout, it is no wonder this book has been named a classic and studied in English Literature.<br /><br />The lives of Jem and Scout are changed forever as they witness a case involving an African American man whom is wrongly accused of a crime and defended by Atticus.  Additionally, they learn life lessons as Scout enters school and moves up in the ranks with Jem.  Atticus calls upon his sister, Alexandra, when the case begins to take a toll on the family as the children are forced to deal with some people's unbending ways and negative views of Atticus's client, Tom Robinson.  Then, there is the mysterious gifts that appear in the knot of the old tree infront of the Radley place.  Will Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill ever be able to get Boo Radley to come out of his house?<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all who have not yet read it and to those looking to revisit an old classic.
B00005JP0A|3.0|Andrea (Anne Hathaway, \\"The Princess Diaries\\", \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"), fresh out of Northwestern University and clutching her journalism degree, arrives in New York looking for her first job in publishing. At her only interview, she is offered the choice of working at a Car magazine or as the second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), demanding editor of \\"Runway\\", THE fashion industry bible. The first meeting does not go well, but Emily (Emily Blunt), Miranda's first assistant informs her she got the job. The next morning, Andrea receives a call at 6:15 am and realizes she is way out of her depth. One day  Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Miranda's favored Print Editor, gives Andrea the lowdown; she hasn't been able to get a handle on the job because she thinks the job is below her. Realizing he is right, Andrea seeks his help with a fashion makeover and she soon proves adept at the job, surprising her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier, HBO's \\"Entourage\\") and a respected writer (Simon Baker) who shows an interest in more than just giving her help her publish `real' writing.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", based on the enormously popular bestseller, has finally made it to the screen. It is an oft-told tale, many times in a more compelling fashion, but a standout performance and some funny moments help the film stand out. Barely.<br /><br />It is difficult to watch a great actor in a film that doesn't live up to their performance. Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I can be objective (\\"Prime\\", \\"A Prairie Home Companion\\"). \\"Prada\\" is overall better than her previous few films, but it is still along way from great. But Streep is by far the best thing in the film, her performance is outstanding. As Miranda, the demanding, bitchy editor of a \\"Vogue\\" like magazine, she embodies the character so fully, we feel a chill running down our spine every time she walks on screen. Many bosses are demanding, domineering and manipulative but the difference is Miranda lives and breathes the job and this magazine. It is her life. As such, she expects her assistants to be able to get things done. Of course, there are bosses out there who take this to the extreme; they begin speaking in shorthand, ask for more things than one person can handle, make outrageous demands. This is where the comedy comes in.<br /><br />It wouldn't be unusual or amusing if Miranda were simply demanding, she has to be impossible. As soon as the office learns she is on her way, they quickly change out of sensible, comfortable shoes into more fashionable pumps. Every morning when she comes in, she dumps her purse and coat on the desk of her second assistant and ignores Andrea's greeting before entering her own office to find a super hot Starbucks and the competitor's magazines laid out on her desk. She expects her assistants to work miracles; get stores to open early (which they do, for Miranda), get the new, unpublished Harry Potter book, the like. Amazingly, Andrea learns how to do this and becomes quite adept.nd breathes the job and this magazine. It is her life. As such, she expects her assistants to be able to get things done.

0425179877|5.0|Reading Gene Kranz's experience as mission controller at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration brought back childhood dreams of being a \\"space man\\". Gene Kranz lead an exciting life, and he relates his story through exciting tales from is tenure at NASA.<br /><br />Many times during his recollection of events at NASA I felt the the exhilaration of a mission accomplished, and the defeat and sadness during NASA's failures. I felt the adrenaline coursing through my veins during the reentry into the atmosphere of Apollo 13, and felt saddened when reading the account of the electrical fire that took the lives of three brave astronauts.<br /><br />Much can be learned from Kranz's life experiences in both making career decisions and in facing conflict head on without surrendering or admitting defeat. Often Gene Kranz's bravery and persistence during a seemingly impossible situation, has inspired me during challenges in life.<br /><br />I would recommend keeping this book in your library for reference in dealing with your own seemingly impossible tasks. This book will help you in making decisions concerning your career and your life.<br /><br />It must have been difficult for Gene to give up his flying job for a desk job, but the world and our country are the better from his selfless decision.Gene's dedication to his family, the space program, and the the United States of America is evident in his memoirs. Gene's memoir's truly attest to his being a great Man and a great American.
B00005JOQT|3.0|There is a lot familiar, good and well executed in \\"Superman Returns\\". But in some ways, this works against the film, adding to its many faults.<br /><br />Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth after a five year journey to an asteroid containing the remnants of his planet, Krypton. Crash landing on the Kent farm, his mom (Eva Marie Saint) welcomes him back with open arms. Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has also been busy during the last five years; romancing the rich elderly woman who helped him get out of prison, he gets her to sign over her fortune, just as she dies, despite the loud protests of her family. Using the old woman's yacht, Lex, Kitty (Parker Posey) and his henchmen travel to the Fortress of Solitude where Lex wants to learn more about crystals. Returning to Metropolis, ready to save the planet, Clark Kent learns a lot has changed at the Daily Planet as well. Perry White (Frank Langella) has brought in his nephew Richard (James Marsden) to help run the paper. Lois and Richard have been seeing each other and have a small son, Jason (Tristan Lake Lebeau). Clark learns Lois has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for an article entitled \\"Why The World Doesn't Need Superman?\\" But where is Lois (Kate Bosworth)? She is covering a new shuttle launch, riding the 747 which will launch the spacecraft. At that moment, Lex decides to experiment with a small shaving from one of the crystals he brought back from the Fortress of Solitude, releasing a burst of power and providing Superman with the perfect opportunity to reenter the public eye.<br /><br />Directed by Bryan Singer (\\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"X-Men\\"), \\"Superman Returns\\" is a well-produced film with a lot of baggage.<br /><br />Frankly, I was expecting a better film from the director who brought us two great movies. This appears to be an example of a director who finally has the opportunity to direct his dream project and becomes so wrapped up in the details, they throw story and character development out the window, everything that made their previous films so good. No one even seems to think to ask where Kent/ Superman has been during the last five years, everyone just seems to except it. There are brief allusions to the reason for the trip during his reunion with his mom, but these scenes only make him seem a little heartless. How could he leave his mom, an elderly widow, alone for five years? She seems to accept this, so we go along with it. Really, the only person who seems to have taken the absence poorly is Lois Lane. Her relationship with Richard is more of a convenience. She was suddenly left alone and needed someone to confide in, so she started dating Richard. Yet, in five years, they have never married so where does their relationship stand? She doesn't seem to be in love with Richard, but because she has a son, she sticks with him. It is up to Singer to answer these questions and make these relationships interesting and believable, but he doesn't do that. Surely, they could have spent another couple of million to polish the screenplay a little more before going into production? With a reported budget of $200 million, what's another $2 million?<br /><br />A side note: the addition of Richard (James Marsden) is a blatant attempt to help this role skew younger. In the sequels (Provided there are any. I don't see this film generating a lot of profit.) I'm sure Perry (Frank Langella) will be retired, vacationing or deceased and his younger, more attractive nephew will take over. But the character is so bland; it won't add anything except a pretty face. Richard needs a dark side, an alter ego, along the lines of James Franco's character in the \\"Spiderman\\" series.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is the spitting image of Superman. But he is the spitting image of our recollection of Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the character. The two actors bear a remarkable resemblance. And that isn't a good thing, because it points to many deficiencies in the portrayal. Reeve had a goofy,sort of everyman quality which made the role of Clark Kent live. As Superman, he had the physique and good looks to pull that off as well. Routh certainly has all of that, but his remarkable resemblance to Reeve causes us to make comparisons we shouldn't have to make. Routh looks like a younger version of the deceased Reeve and his presence reminds us of the other actor's passing.<br /><br />Pushing that aside for the moment, is Routh any good? Because of the remarkable resemblance, it is all but impossible not to compare them. He has a certain goofy quality which works well as Kent. But it doesn't seem as natural as his predecessor. At one point, his glasses slip down his nose, threatening to reveal his identity as Superman. He quickly pushes them back. Reeve did the exact same thing, but he seemed more flustered, more concerned and more real in a comic book, goofy kind of way.<br /><br />As Superman, Routh certainly has the looks and physique to make him a super hero, but he doesn't do much with the character. As the Man of Steel, he almost never speaks and very little seems to cause him any significant problems.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is a complete void in the role of Lois Lane. She never seems able to build any chemistry with Kent, Superman or Richard. In her one extended sequence with the little boy playing her son, she seems to regard him as an obligation and little else.<br /><br />When Kent returns to the Daily Planet, Bosworth's Lane seems to regard him as more of nuisance. Yes, Margot Kidder did the same thing, but she also managed to convey that there was the hint of a romantic interest there. Bosworth never seems to be even remotely interested in Richard (Marsden). It's maddening to see a performance like this. Didn't the director notice that Bosworth was unable to create any chemistry with either of her leading men? I would think it would be unavoidable, but perhaps he felt this was the best he was going to get.<br /><br />Perhaps the only actress who could've done a worse job is Kate Beckinsale. Bosworth seems to be a living computer generated image, all looks and no feeling, merely going through the motions in service of the story. Character? What character?<br /><br />Spacey owes a lot to the work of Gene Hackman, who played the role in the first series of films. As Lex Luthor, he has the swagger, the confidence and the mad scheme, but the scheme doesn't appear to have been fully plotted, Luthor doesn't actually know what the extent of his plan will be. This is not a good development, because it makes him seem less threatening. Even with all of the comical moments, the interactions with the Otis (Ned Beatty) and Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine), Hackman's Luthor always seemed threatening. He knew the warhead would destroy the West Coast and give him control of a large piece of `beachfront property'. Because he didn't care where the second warhead landed, his Luthor became even more diabolical. Spacey's Luthor doesn't know the full extent of what he is doing and too much of it takes him by surprise. Therefore, he seems more like comic relief. The one moment of threat comes late in the film, when Superman and Luthor finally meet on the little continent the villain has just created. Spacey's Luthor simply doesn't show both traits well; he has some amusing moments, but he never really appears threatening.<br /><br />It also doesn't help that he is surrounded by the most forgettable crew of henchmen to appear in a film in some time. Honestly, I can't remember anyone's name except for Parker Posey's character and that is because I recognize the actress. As Kitty, Posey does an OK job of demonstrating her continued dismay with Lex, but she never fully develops as a character. Why is she with Luthor? Why does she start to cry when she learns of Luthor's plan? It is maddening that these questions arise. All of this should have been answered. Singer has let us down.<br /><br />So what's good about \\"Superman Returns\\"? They use the familiar \\"Superman\\" theme composed by John Williams during the familiar credits sequence.<br /><br />Okay. There is more. That's giving the film too little credit.<br /><br />The film is well-designed and executed. Every frame of the film looks like it exists in the real world, even when Superman is trying to save a 747 plummeting to earth or when Lex and his henchman are cavorting over a new landmass. The technicians on the film went to great pains to make the Kent Farm look realistic, to recreate the Daily Planet building, to invest the old woman's home with a creepy opulence and to build a yacht fit for a lunatic. All of these beautifully designed locations help to make the world of Superman more believable. But without believable characters, it merely seems like window dressing.<br /><br />There are also a few great action sequences. The first is the scene with the 747. As soon as we see Lois Lane among the press corps riding the 747, we know something bad will happen. Then, when they reveal a Space Shuttle will be launched from the top of the jet, we begin to get the idea. Luthor's experiments cause a power failure and threaten everyone on the plane. The sequence is terrific. From the moment, the shuttle ignites while malfunctioning and still attached to the plane and the press corps on the plane begin to travel at supersonic speed, to the moment Superman helps the plane come to a safe landing in the middle of a baseball diamond, everything looks real and scary and life threatening.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the moment we are reintroduced to Lois Lane. And as she gets tossed around the cabin of the 747, we are there with her, but we don't really care about the threat to her life. Why? Because we don't care for this character yet. We haven't been with her long enough or learned anything new to make us care. This robs the sequence of a significant amount of suspense. Because one of the main characters is involved in the scene isn't enough, we have to know about that person, care about them, worry about their safety.<br /><br /> The other interesting scene involves Luthor's new continent. Watching the land mass grow, many of the consequences of this action pose a threat to innocent people in Metropolis and Superman has to rush off and correct a number of life threatening problems. It is a fun sequence, simply because we watch the Man of Steel solving many problems, quickly, neatly. These two sequences come the closest to creating the roller coaster type moments you would expect many times in a film running 2 hours and 40 minutes.<br /><br />I do recommend \\"Superman Returns\\", but just barely. All of the great production design makes the film a feast for the eyes, too bad the actors are almost universally wrong, bad or uninteresting.the only actress who could've done a worse job is Kate Beckinsale. Bosworth seems to be a living computer generated image, all looks and no feeling, merely going through the motions in service of the story. Character? What character? <br /> <br />Spacey owes a lot to the work of Gene Hackman, who played the role in the first series of films. As Lex Luthor, he has the swagger, the confidence and the mad scheme, but the scheme doesn't appear to have been fully plotted, Luthor doesn't actually know what the extent of his plan will be. This is not a good development, because it makes him seem less threatening. Even with all of the comical moments, the interactions with the Otis (Ned Beatty) and Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine), Hackman's Luthor always seemed threatening. He knew the warhead would destroy the West Coast and give him control of a large piece of `beachfront property'. Because he didn't care where the second warhead landed, his Luthor became even more diabolical. Spacey's Luthor doesn't know the full extent of what he is doing and too much of it takes him by surprise. Therefore, he seems more like comic relief. The one moment of threat comes late in the film, when Superman and Luthor finally meet on the little continent the villain has just created. Spacey's Luthor simply doesn't show both traits well; he has some amusing moments, but he never really appears threatening. <br /> <br />It also doesn't help that he is surrounded by the most forgettable crew of henchmen to appear in a film in some time. Honestly, I can't remember anyone's name except for Parker Posey's character and that is because I recognize the actress. As Kitty, Posey does an OK job of demonstrating her continued dismay with Lex, but she never fully develops as a character. Why is she with Luthor? Why does she start to cry when she learns of Luthor's plan? It is maddening that these questions arise. All of this should have been answered. Singer has let us down. <br /> <br />So what's good about \\"Superman Returns\\"? They use the familiar \\"Superman\\" theme composed by John Williams during the familiar credits sequence. <br /> <br />Okay. There is more. That's giving the film too little credit. <br /> <br />The film is well-designed and executed. Every frame of the film looks like it exists in the real world, even when Superman is trying to save a 747 plummeting to earth or when Lex and his henchman are cavorting over a new landmass. The technicians on the film went to great pains to make the Kent Farm look realistic, to recreate the Daily Planet building, to invest the old woman's home with a creepy opulence and to build a yacht fit for a lunatic. All of these beautifully designed locations help to make the world of Superman more believable. But without believable characters, it merely seems like window dressing. <br /> <br />There are also a few great action sequences. The first is the scene with the 747. As soon as we see Lois Lane among the press corps riding the 747, we know something bad will happen. Then, when they reveal a Space Shuttle will be launched from the top of the jet, we begin to get the idea. Luthor's experiments cause a power failure and threaten everyone on the plane. The sequence is terrific. From the moment, the shuttle ignites while malfunctioning and still attached to the plane and the press corps on the plane begin to travel at supersonic speed, to the moment Superman helps the plane come to a safe landing in the middle of a baseball diamond, everything looks real and scary and life threatening. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is the moment we are reintroduced to Lois Lane. And as she gets tossed around the cabin of the 747, we are there with her, but we don't really care about the threat to her life. Why? Because we don't care for this character yet. We haven't been with her long enough or learned anything new to make us care. This robs the sequence of a significant amount of suspense. Because one of the main characters is involved in the scene isn't enough, we have to know about that person, care about them, worry about their safety. <br /> <br /> The other interesting scene involves Luthor's new continent. Watching the land mass grow, many of the consequences of this action pose a threat to innocent people in Metropolis and Superman has to rush off and correct a number of life threatening problems. It is a fun sequence, simply because we watch the Man of Steel solving many problems, quickly, neatly. These two sequences come the closest to creating the roller coaster type moments you would expect many times in a film running 2 hours and 40 minutes. <br /> <br />I do recommend \\"Superman Returns\\", but just barely. All of the great production design makes the film a feast for the eyes, too bad the actors are almost universally wrong, bad or uninteresting.   <br />
B00005UW7G|4.0|This DVD is my introduction to opera.  I was encouraged to try a Mozart opera first because they are the most accessible.  This production was well filmed and acted.  As I do not speak Italian, I really needed the English subtitles.  The only down side to this production was the quality of the voice recording.  It often sounded like they were singing into a box, while the orchestra sounded fine. <br />If you are new to opera, this is a great DVD.
0743455967|5.0|A friend told me about this book and how inspirational and sensible it was...she's right...it is.  A great read and a great guide.
B00005JOQS|2.0|The acting in this film is actually pretty good.  I mean, it's not oscar worthy or anything, but it's based on a comic book and the actors give noteworthy performances.  That said, the script is pretty bad - not going to lie. The beginning of the film is poorly edited and choppy, and the plot line throughout the entire film is weak.  Tristan Lebeau is ardorable as Lois Lane's 5 year-old son, and provides some comic relief to an otherwise drab film.  Kevin Spacey's malicious Lex Luther also provides for a few laughs.  In all honesty I could go on and on to credit the rest of the cast as well - they were well chosen and did the best they could with a weak and flawed script.  Ah well, let's just hope Superman Returns again in an entertaining film...
B000002NZO|5.0|In the year 1969, Genesis released their debut album, \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\". The seeds were sown for their future progressive tendencies, but were smothered by producer Jonathan King's persistence to add horns to the mixes to satiate his then-current obsession for the Bee Gees, thus ruining this otherwise fair album. <br />Genesis wisely ditched King and landed on Charisma Records, and with the assistance of new producer John Anthony, those seeds planted a year before were finally allowed to blossom, and \\"Trespass\\" was culled from this first of several harvests. Although both Phil Collins and Steve Hackett had yet to climb onboard this train, predecessors John Mayhew and Anthony Phillips more than get the job done on this set of six songs. <br />Opening with lead singer Peter Gabriel's voice penetrating through the silence in \\"Looking for Someone\\", the band shows on this release that they would not stand any attempts at modification and that they were far removed from the horns, albeit was only a year before. <br />Tracks of particular interest to me are \\"White Mountain\\" (with its magnificent Tony Banks-led opening that conjures up a snowy, desolate landscape in the mind) and \\"Stagnation\\" (a beautiful nine minute piece with a peaceful instrumental passage led by Banks and his wonderful organ). But, of course, nothing here stands out quite like the explosive nine-minute finale, \\"The Knife\\". Here the five lads definitely work together as one to bring this behemoth to roaring life. Strikingly different from the other cuts on the album, this song shows the brute power that they were capable of delivering and the magnificent songwriting which they would always be capable of pulling off (until long after the Peter Gabriel days, at least). This became the first memorable Genesis tune and pointed in the direction they would soon travel. <br />It's an utter shame that the Phil Collins era is particularly remembered in this band's history because (especially concerning\\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"We Can't Dance\\") they seemed to be copying others in their commercial songs and really didn't seem to have anything to say. This album captures a truly unique voice which should be remembered as much, nay, even more than the last couple of albums Phil did with the band. This album is truly a lost classic, and hopefully the general public will eventually appreciate this album as much as I do. An absolute must-have. <br />

B00005JOQS|5.0|After years of waiting, speculating, dreading, fearing, and finally getting excited about all over again comes a comic book epic worthy of its hero.  This one is a loving tribute to the first one, right down to the opening credits to jokes about Lois Lane's spelling.  It's simply great. <br /> <br />The actors are new, but t he characters are the same with a couple of twists.  Kevin Spacey is menacing as Lex, not nearly as campy as Hackman was.  Brandon Roth seemed to capture the surety of Superman, with the earnest of Clark Kent.  Lots of plot twists and special effects galore!  It is a real feast to the eye to take it all in.  I am writing this after seeing it for my third time.  I hardly EVER pay to see a movie 3 times!  Its well worth the ticket price.  Can' t wait for the DVD!!!! <br />See it on the big screen, IMAX 3-D if you can.  You will believe a man can fly...again.

0375405380|5.0|In classical antiquity poetic art was divided into three broad categories: lyric, dramatic, and epic.  The novel descends from the epic, though it seldom resembles it.  Also in antiquity, authors scaled the genre ladder, beginning with pastoral and georgic and eventually moving on to epic.  Don Winslow, like James Ellroy, has followed a parallel path, beginning with traditional genre fiction and moving on to something far more ambitious, in Winslow's case something that is epic in aspiration, if not in all of its specific elements.  The sometimes incantatory nature of epic is here replaced with a narrative that, while complex, is always crystal clear and lightning fast.<br /><br />This is a book that is daring in its size and scope and equally daring in its models and antecedents.  The protagonist's obsessions with evil and his willingness to conquer it at any personal cost is explicitly Melvillean.  Winslow's tracing of the connections between the evils of North and South America in an ethos of revolution and counterrevolution is explicitly Conradian, though The Power of the Dog is realized on an even grander scale than Conrad's masterpiece, Nostromo.<br /><br />There have been concerns expressed about his criticism of American policies and actions, but while they are there they must also be seen in terms of the first dictate of the noir gospel: large organizations, be they crime families, unions, companies, or governments threaten the individual and the small degree of happiness and integrity that is possible in the world that they have wrought is seldom available except through limited, personal relationships.  Personal loyalty is the summum bonum in this world and it drives the narrative in The Power of the Dog.<br /><br />The historical sweep and detail is impressive, even though there is a lapse here and there.  The M60 machine gun, e.g., fires the standard 7.62 NATO round, not a 50 calibre round.  These are small matters in the face of Winslow's accomplishment--an instant classic, one of the top crime novels of our time.  Don't fear its physical weight; the pages flip by like a hydrofoil on a sea of blood.plishment--an instant classic, one of the top crime novels of our time.

B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Rise Against has done it again! They are my favorite band and between their last 3 releases (including this one), it is not hard to see why. \\"Wow!\\" is about all I can say about this record. Rise Against has released yet another gem. This album is amazing and, without a doubt, deserves no less than five stars.<br /><br />From opening to closing, \\"The Sufferer & The Witness\\" has every factor that contributes to the making of a great album. It carries great dynamics, going from lullabies to fits of emotional rage. It has some very interesting surprises, including odd tempos and tempo changes, and some well-placed guest vocals. The lyrics are exactly what you'd expect from the remarkable Tim McIlrath: extremely expressive, poetic and soaked with detail and emotion, covering topics ranging from politics to religion to saving the environment. The music stays true to the classic Rise Against hardcore punk style (such as in \\"Bricks\\", \\"Injection\\", and many others), but also branches off into more of a rock manner, like \\"Siren Song Of The Counter Culture\\"did. The musicianship is nothing less than spectacular, which is just what you'd expect from the Chicago foursome. Tim's vocals are melodic and deep, and even the spoken parts grip your emotions and send them on the ride of their life. The guitar work is a perfect fit and the drumming...well let's just say Brandon has got skills. MAD skills.<br /><br />Main point, get this album if you're a Rise Against fan. Heck, get this album if you like music at all!! Also, check out \\"Revolutions Per Minute\\" and \\"Siren Song Of The Counter Culture\\", also by Rise Against. You might want to look into their debut \\"The Unraveling\\", but as good as a debut as it is, it is lacking compared to the band's last three gems. Enjoy!!
0316168815|4.0|I thought this was a very well written book. It was a book that I had \\"heard\\" about for the past couple of years and just hadn't gotten around to reading yet. It is worth reading. It is sad, but very thought provoking. The best book that I have read this summer!
B000000WFZ|5.0|One of the best soundtracks for a film ever - truly beautiful music that enhanced the narrative throughout the film.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is byfar one of my favorite albums ever, this is my second favorite albuum by RHCP, first obviously being BSSMnow some people have problems with the sound quality, but i dont have any problems with that, so....whatever,  <br /> <br />1. Around The World - A great open to the album, starting off with that incredibly good bass line by flea, anthony's raping are catchy and the simple guitar in the backround that soon erupts into a hard rockin riff is nothing short of perfection. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Parallel Universe - A very good song, fleas and johns playing really is a treat in this, its simple, but picks up in the end with johns really cool solo. the chorus is also pretty cool. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />3. Scar Tissue -Easilly one of the best songs on the album, its touching and just makes you feel god whenever you listen to it, a  chili peppers classic 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Otherside - A beutiful, yet depressing song which very pleasing to the ears, the harmonies are fantastic, and the bass and guitar are just fountians of emotion, its a tear jerker, 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Get On Top - A great pick up song after the slightly depressing otherside, it picks you up with its great guitar which goes into a funky whaa, the lyrics are kind of whack, but when i say that i mean wiggity whack, which is the good kind 9.5/10 <br /> <br />6. Californication - i think we all know and love this song, and if you dont, then why do you own this album. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Easily - a great song with (once again) great guitar by john, the vocals are also very good, the chorus is my favorite on the album, one of the best on the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Porcelain - Ok, this song is very slow, like, EXTREMLY SLOW, i find it hard to make it through the whole song, its just too damn slow, its a song that i skip on the album mostly because i cant get into it, some people say its a beutiful song,, take their advice on it, its too slow for me though, 6/10 <br /> <br />9. Emit Remmus - Agood song by itself, but after i figured out that Emit Remmus is Summer Time backwards, it made me enjoy its so much more, which turned it into a very good song for me, 8/10 <br /> <br />10. I Like Dirt - A very funky song that is fun to sing along too, mostly because of anthonys weird singing in this, it picks you up and caresses ears, and shakes your booty 9/10 <br /> <br />11. This Velvet Glove - A Deep song, but i still love it, its got that soft touch, but then the chorus erupts into a harder song and then smooths out, the harmonies by john are the perfect compliment to his acoustic in the backround and his electric upfornt. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. Savior - A Great Opening with Johns guitar and a seemless transistion to anthony, the bass here is also very good, but Chads drumming is what makes the song good, it picks up the song and slows it down beutifully, then there is a part where it john and anthony singing and its just beutiful, one of the greatest moments, all in all a fantastic song 9.5/10 <br /> <br />13. Purple Stain - A Fantastic Funk song, my favorite on the whole album, the guitar is so simple, its just great, the lyrics are so sweet is like playing in a feild and eating candy the whole time, the bass is a very funky complitment to johns guitar. the chorus is amazingly funky, and the intrumental ending is also quite nice 10+/10 <br /> <br />14. Right On Time - This song is a good one, but veryu loud, and there is no intro, thats why in live shows they always add on the london calling beginning, its a little hard to get into because of the absense of the intro, but its a very good song, especially the chorus 8.5/10 <br /> <br />15. Road Trippin' - A Very soft song that is a good outro to the album, the acoustic guitar is flawless and the bass is alswell, the harmonies are also beutiful, the violin or whatevers in the backround is beutiful, and just a treat for the ears. 9/10
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Really pleased with the extras on this DVD - thought the film was delightful from beginning to end.  What's not to like!  Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury - three wonderful performances and the children were remarkable.  Did not hurt to have Derek Jacobi and Kelly MacDonald in here as well not to mention Imelda Staunton.  Such gifted performers all in one film!
B00005JOVH|4.0|A few Spoilers <br /> <br />I really liked the transformation of Jean Grey in this film, it was cool to see the resolution of a strand in the series in which Grey was initially one of the weakest of the mutants (in the first film) yet all along was the greatest but was holding in her powers. The Phoenix is very well portrayed by the gorgeous Famke Janssen, when she gets mad her face appears alien and terrifying (hats off to the cgi team) and her powers exceed all others (which makes sense since full strength telekinises WOULD give her an advantage against anyone else). <br /> <br />I also liked the deaths which occurred, it was good to see the back of cyclops whose laser beam talent was never effectively dealt with by the filmmakers over the three films and whose constant grumpiness was a turnoff. Xavier was always interesting in the series yet it is good when a director is not afraid to kill off the major characters. I wish they had not killed the Phoenix off the way they did though, then again she IS the Phoenix and if there is a new film she may be back! <br />I agree with another reviewer that maybe Storm should have been the one pitted against the Phoenix, but would telekinesis affect lightning? <br /> <br />Ian Mckellan puts in a good performance as the twisted Magneto, we see him all holds barred here, throwing bridges and cars around like they were toys and Pyro is an eye catcher as the human flamethrower. I still think Magneto and Pyro should have been able to wipe the floor with the opposition in the showdown at the end... I also think that some of the new villains were not interesting enough, their clothes and attitudes and powers were too similiar and perhaps the director tried to introduce too many new mutants overall, i mean... was Angel really necessary? In any event i hope the makers bring Phoenix back for the next film and also use Mystique again in some way.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FGGE68|1.0|I could rant for hours about why this movie is horrible, but why bother? Let me sum it up quickly: The fight scenes look like some sort of faux Cirque Du Soleil performance, only horribly ugly and with all the performers but one falling over dead at the end. Whereas the fight scenes in Wimmer's other film, Equilibrium, were simply boring, Ultraviolet's are actually painful to watch.<br /><br />Milla Jovovitch proves once again that she can't act worth a damn. She commits ever acting gaffe imaginable, from emotionlessness to chewing the scenery.<br /><br />Kurt Wimmer cannot write. At all. He depends on enormous amounts of exposition to deliver the simplest plot points. The pacing is so awful that a full eighteenth of the movie is Violet walking through a corridor and getting poked and prodded by medical instruments. There are plot holes and inconsistencies galore, and  many of them are so awful they smack you in the face. Plot? Characterization? hah! What's that?<br /><br />There's nothing good to be found in this movie. Avoid at all costs.
B00005JOQS|3.0|The long-awaited SUPERMAN RETURNS is a good movie, but not a great one. <br /> <br />To its credit, I can deeply appreciated keeping the homage to Richard Donner's original 1978 SUPERMAN, with John Williams' score, the soaring opening credits, Marlon Brando footage and Brandon Routh's similarities to the late Christopher Reeve, intact.  Hell, if you look carefully, you can even spot a picture of legendary actor Glenn Ford, who played Jonathon Kent in the original SUPERMAN.  The performances by all involved are more than fair, especially from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. <br /> <br />Where SUPERMAN RETURNS fails, in my opinion, is the severe lack of action.  Except for the rescue of a jet airliner and bullets violently bouncing off of Superman's chest, the movie is filled with mostly visual wonderment and natural disaster (both of which we had plenty of in the original SUPERMAN).  I should also point out that the outcome of Lex Luthor (he ends up stranded on a deserted island with Parker Posey; who by the way, absolutely ruins the whole movie!  Who told her she could act???) is incredibly stupid.  Sorry for giving that one away.  Tough. <br /> <br />So, all in all, Bryan Singer has nothing really new to offer his audience except for brand new actors. <br /> <br />If you read up on the history of this project, you'll know that there was a time the studio was considering a script based on the 1992 comic book DEATH OF SUPERMAN.  Action-wise, that would have been much more spectacular!  Perhaps they'll consider it for the sequel.  He can die in that one and be resurrected for the third film.  Just like Spock in STAR TREK II and III.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Going through my cassettes and replacing with CD's.  This was on the top of the list.  Still sounds as great as it did back then.
0385512058|4.0|The book contains some basics that probably should be standard fare for every college student preparing to enter the world.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because a few of the examples/stories he provided were long-winded or simply didn't seem relevant to my own experiences in the workplace.  But then, this book isn't just about how to build relationships at work, but also in our personal lives as well.  My copy now contains a good number of bright blue highlights throughout, a good sign that it's a worthwhile read.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I love this show and am sad to see it be cancelled. I would def. buy all seasons of the show and hope they release all of them. This show was touching, heart-warming and real and always made me laugh or cry.  I can watch it over and over again. Def. worth it - you have to get a copy!
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chbosky's THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is the simplest book I've ever read. And when I say simple, I don't mean it in the Lennie-From-Of-Mice-And-Men sort of way. I mean it in the How-Are-These-Letters-Getting-Me-To-Feel-So-Much? sort of way. The honest voice trapped within this series of letters records a year in the life of a sensitive guy just trying to survive and understand his freshman year of high school.<br /><br />Charlie can't help being so quiet and observant. He doesn't have many friends, and the ones he manages to make are two or three years older than he is. Like Sam, the senior girl who doesn't think he's crazy for being who he is. And Patrick, who lets him in on the secrets of teenage life. And Bill, the first-year teacher who gives Charlie advanced reading assignments because he realizes there's a gifted side to Charlie that nobody else but Aunt Helen ever sees. But those friends are the ones who get him to understand that life may be good when you sit back and observe but it's infinitely better when you participate.<br /><br />If only things were that easy. His dad's telling him to work through his problems because some people have it much worse than he does. His brother's gone off to college. His sister won't stop seeing the guy who beats her. Patrick doesn't want anyone to know he's gay. In fact, everyone seems trust him with their deepest darkest secrets and expect him to lock them up inside. On top of that, the girl he loves won't look at him that way because he's too young.<br /><br />Until the Secret Santa gift exchange and the party scene and the kiss and the slashed tires and the joyride to the city with Sam and Patrick with the stereo playing music they'll never forget and Sam standing up in the back of the truck and the wind whirling her dress and the lights of the city flashing into view and them feeling infinite. Because if anything's capable of changing a wallflower, it's that. And it's a beautiful thing to watch.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|The duel between the boy and the devil's guitarplayer was actually filmed using the hands of Ry Cooder himself (who also wrote the score), taking on Steve Vai, playing Jack Butler. <br />Only when he remembers the lessons of his Juilliard guitar teacher, he realises he can beat this devilish guitarslinger, he turns to the baroque patterns that finally break Butler up. <br /> <br />One of the best scenes ever shot in a musicfilm.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|I like many gay men love dance music. However, I found Madonna's latest to be utterly boring. To sum it up, it reminds me of being at a bad after hours bar and they just keep playing the same monotonous songs over and over again, before you know it it's 5am and you have a pounding headache and you just want to go home. Madonna's become a brand, and a boring one at that. The first single \\"Hung Up\\" was atrocious. What a waste of an Abba sample. My biggest complaint is that Madonna's lost her spunk, and it's evident on this entire album. She sounds like she's going through the motions, there is no fun left in her vocals (well there isn't much to her vocals to begin with). Where's fun Madonna? I think she got lost somewhere between Kabalah and English Roses. Madonna hasn't made a good album since RAY OF LIGHT and it's becoming painfully obvious.

Well the few singers we have today considering everyone wants to be a rapper now!!! This cd proves why she will be around for years to come. Come on now who can take a vacation and come back and still drop another hot cd. Oh yea Usher but it toke him a while to come out with a cd that put on top of his game. Alicia Keys came out on top with her debut cd. This is such a great cd that anybody can listen to. Young old and in between. so stop reading the reviews and buy the ALBUM!!!! I WILL QUARENTEE THAT U WILL LOVE IT!!!! ALICIA KEYS IS HERE TO STAY!!!!
B000005GYI|5.0|The recent World Cup sparked me to go searching for Brazilian music.  I was familiar with a few tunes from Nascimento's Clube da Esquina LP, having seen him perform several times in Chicago.  But wow-- nearly every song on this 1972 disk is either melodically compelling or flat-out inspirational.  Take a listen to \\"Tudo Que Voce Podia Ser,\\" \\"Cravo e Canela,\\" \\"Nuvem Cigana,\\" and \\"Cais.\\"  If you ever meet anyone curious about Brazilian music, this is one of the places to start.
B000001GQJ|5.0|Before this performance I thought that I did not like the sonata because no other pianist could keep its many parts and segments together from the beginning to the end. This is the only performance that does that for me. When I listened to it for the first time, I broke up in tears. Argerich's interpretation is mezmerizing. Buy it! Any serious music collector should have this CD.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Some movies have implausible plots that can often be overlooked,but when they get too far-fetched,they spoil the whole movie.KING KONG has these which reduce the overall continuity of the film.    In comparison with the classic 1933 version,this remake undoubtedly excels in almost every aspect of movie making.Yet it has some distinct plot holes :    1. The tribal native vaulting from pole to pole over a series   of broken headlands in  bad weather at night,kidnapping the lead actress from the ship and carrying her back to the land.        Seeing that the poles are stuck to the sea bed,it is hard to believe that a pole can be THAT long.All the more implausible is the way the native returns from the ship,with the victim, to the land.        The 1933 version has the natives use a boat and jump onto the ship to kidnap the lead actress. This is plausible.    2.  The surviving expedition crew hauling the drugged Kong up   onto the ship.            With only few survivors left alive and without any possible aid from the hostile natives,how do they do that ?        In the 1933 version,Kong is said to be brought to the ship on a makeshift raft and besides,there are also the natives who might have given help.Quite convincing.    3.  Kong being chained and exhibited in the concert hall.            The building must have been built before Kong is brought    back to New York.So,how do the people get Kong inside it ? How HUGE can the hall entrance be considering the location of the hall in the city center ?            There is not any depiction of any rear or special entrance from where Kong is brought in. The 1933 version has it. Clever.    Were this the 1933 version,I would compromise.But being a 2005 remake,these should have been made more convincing.    That said,the 2005 version has proven that not all remakes are  worse than the original.KING KONG will become a FUTURE classic just as the 1933 version has.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller.  This is a classic that every high school student should see.  It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best.  It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star.
0060926317|1.0|MUTANT MESSAGE DOWN UNDER <br /> <br />The familiar message is always worth repeating,  that civilization's progress is harmful to the environment.  However, the theme of the \\"noble savage\\" with mystical, super-natural powers and knowledge is so exaggerated it dashes any authenticity of the story.  This sort of  speculation is done frequently -- James Hilton, Carlos Castenada, etc -- and panders to attitudes of wishful thinking among readers. <br /> <br />Is it a good book?  Yes, if you enjoyed reading it. <br /> <br />Is it true?  Of course not. <br />
B00005MNP8|5.0|I first heard Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\" LP while browsing at the Tower Records store in Westwood, near UCLA in 1978.  By the time I heard the opening chords of the second song, I had a copy of the LP in line for the cash register. <br /> <br />Years have passed since, and a lot of Blondie's original fans were turned off or confused by some of their subsequent efforts.  For those of you that used to really love Blondie, take another listen to Parallel Lines, and you'll immediately recall why.  You probably haven't heard \\"Will Anything Happen,\\" \\"11:59,\\" \\"Pretty Baby,\\" \\"Sunday Girl,\\" or \\"Fade Away and Radiate\\" for a while, but they've held up pretty well.  Add the classics \\"One Way or Another,\\" \\"Hanging on the Telephone,\\" and \\"Heart of Glass,\\" and another listen to Parallel Lines is like running into an old friend. <br /> <br />This disk includes bonus tracks that reveal the band's live power, especially the fine power drumming of Clem Burke and Debbie Harry's rock diva vocal abilities, especially on a relatively raw version of \\"Bang a Gong.\\"

B00004STUL|4.0|This movie is very fun and full of action.  If you can get past the cursing, it's well worth it.  Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are almost too much fun as cop partners who go deep undercover to recover stolen police evidence (drugs).  Tea Leoni is also hilarious in the film and serves as a great counterpoint to the cocky buddy cops.
B000EGCITG|5.0|This is hands-down my favorite CD to date. When I first bought this CD, I was taking a long road trip and figured I'd listen to it as I drove. That was 2 months ago and this CD has hardly been out of my CD player since. I adore just about every single song on this CD and I LOVE the fact that P!nk actually talks about subject matters besides sex/relationships. She actually has more going on in her life besides how she feels about some man or how some man feels about her. Life is variety and so full of much more than the fodder that passes for music these days.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks:  <br />\\"I Got Money Now\\" because of the lyrics and \\"Conversations with My 13 Year Old Self\\" for the music. I wish they sold the instrumental version of this song; it's the most beautiful piece I've heard in contemporary music in quite some time. <br /> <br />Buy this CD! This is a woman with her head on straight and isn't looking at the world through rose colored glasses. She is such an inspiration to strong-minded, independent women everywhere! <br /> <br />Keep Rockin' P!nk!!!

0060537639|1.0|The subject of this book, the Chinese exploratory voyages of the early 15th century, is an interesting one, and questions remain as to exactly how far they got and what they did. Unfortunately, there is little factual information in this book that is not to be found in other sources, and the novel claims are poorly substantiated. All too often, the \\"facts\\" cited are wrong, the nature of the argument Menzies means to make is unclear, or the evidence that he claims to exist is not actually produced. Let me illustrate from some of Menzies linguistic arguments. He claims that the Squamish language (which he mistakenly locates on Vancouver Island rather than on the coast of the mainland of British Columbia) contains no less than forty words that are identical with Chinese words. He does not cite any of the Squamish words and cites only three Chinese words. Not one of the three alleged Chinese words actually occurs in Chinese. At another point, he cites the fact that there is a village in Peru whose people speak Chinese. Aside from the questionable source of this claim, even if true, what would it prove? To constitute evidence that the Chinese had visited Peru prior to Columbus, he would have to show that the people in this village had spoken Chinese hundreds of years ago. He does not even assert this, much less provide evidence of it. <br /> <br />Menzies' own account of his research techniques leaves one gasping with incredulity at his incompetence. He claims to have inspected a stone inscription in the Cape Verde Islands in a language unknown to him. Thinking that it might be from India, he sends a photograph of it to the Bank of India. The Bank responds that the inscription is in Malayalam. In response to Menzies' query as to what Malayalam might be, according to Menzies the bank responds that it is a language now spoken by only a few people but was more widely used in the 15th century. In point of fact, Malayalam is the principal language of the state of Kerala and is spoken by over 35 million people. It is one of the 22 languages listed in Schedule 8 of the Constitution of India. I am hard put to believe that the Bank of India told him that a language of which any educated Indian is well aware is spoken by only a few people, but if they did, it is stunning that he never bothered to make any further enquiry about it. Simply googling for Malayalam produces 185,000 hits. His own account reveals Menzies to be incompetant as a researcher. Incidentally, he never reveals what the inscription says, assuming that he ever found out. You'd think it would be relevant. As it stands, we are apparently to assume that the only way an inscription in Malayalam might have ended up in the Cape Verde islands is by having been written by someone travelling with Zheng He. It is at least as likely that a ship from India was responsible. <br /> <br />In the areas with which I am familiar, not a single argument is even plausible, much less convincing. Menzies' website, which is supposed to provide details that could not be included in the book as well as new information, is no improvement. The missing 37 Chinese words and 40 Squamish words, for instance, are not to be found on the website. This book is junk, pure and simple. If you want to learn about the voyages of Zheng He, read Louise Levathes' When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405-1433. Unlike Menzies, Levathes knows what she is talking about.
B000268QB2|5.0|One of the best albums I have purchased in a very long time. Every song on the album is great. Usually I am skipping songs on albums but not on this album. Definitely worth the money for me. Music is not too hard or soft but just right.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|9.7 STARS OUT OF 10!!!<br /><br />To start, I was never a huge fan of the Peppers.  When I was 13 or so, I enjoyed BloodSugarSexMagik and eagerly awaited their next CD which was One Hot Minute.  I was disgusted by that CD and I vowed to never listen to the Chili Peppers again.  The word that came to my mind rhymes with RAY.  It was probably that weirdo from Jane's Addiction and his influence.  Many years went by and Californication and By The Way eventually came out and while I enjoyed all the singles, I never attempted to buy the albums.  Part of it was my preference of music at the times of those albums(rap or punk), part of it was the aftertaste One Hot Minute left me.<br /><br />Fast forward to the release of Stadium Arcadium.  I went out for lunch with my uncle about two months ago and he was playing the album.  The three or four songs that I heard, I enjoyed, so I went and bought it.<br /><br />This album blew me away.  There's 28 songs, so the first few listens all kind of melt together.  Once you give it a few spins though, you will realize how good it is.  Out of 28 songs, THERE IS NOT ONE BAD ONE.  That's saying something.  Especially for today's \\"rock\\" music where I'm lucky to find three or four good songs on a CD.<br /><br />After non-stop listening I went and express ordered every other Pepper CD along with reading many reviews for the albums.  I listened to them chronologically and Stadium Arcadium is the best.  I respect the older stuff because you can see where the band came from, but honestly it's just not good music.  I appreciate the energy and the creativeness, and I did listen with an open mind, but the total package was painful to the ears.  BSSM is just the way I remember it.  Is it a good album? Yes.  Is it a great album?  Yes.  Is it the best album ever made?  NO.  There are a handful of GREAT songs, a handful of decent songs, and a bit of filler.  One Hot Minute on a second listen was not as bad as I remembered it.  The first 6 or 7 songs were actually pretty good, but it totally fell apart by the end.  Californication was REALLY good.  Definitely 2nd to Stadium Arcadium.  By The Way was also pretty good.  Seemed very experimental.  Similar to Californication, but a little more mellow.<br /><br />Stadium Arcadium takes a little bit from each of their earlier albums and turns out a masterful double CD.  I highly recommend to any fan of rock music.7 songs were actually pretty good, but it totally fell apart by the end.  Californication was REALLY good.  Definitely 2nd to Stadium Arcadium.

0140544518|5.0|Hilarious fun and so many pedagogical possibilities!  Is it really fair to blame A. Wolf for a \\"terrible sneezing cold\\" and the pigs' poor home construction?  To his credit, A. Wolf never uses the Bart Simpson \\"I didn't do it\\" excuse.  No, he carefully builds a case with the rhetorical skills of a high-priced attorney:  identifying with the audience to engender empathy, suggesting the claim is not warranted by the premises and that circumstantial evidence and bias has entered in and so on.  Now, I'm not against all wolves (some of my best friends have fangs), but his can't-let-good-meat-go-to-waste argument just doesn't ring true...you be the judge.  Activist parents wanting to train their child to argue for the oppressed and see \\"other perspectives\\" will love this book.  Teachers can use this book as a point of departure for writing exercises on point of view.  Christian parents can use it as \\"wolf protection\\" to warn their kids that some in the world might give such a radical different explanation of biblical facts that might seem persuasive, but upon closer examination is fallacious.  For ex, when a \\"new perspective\\" on Paul comes along completely changing the gospel message, the individual might recognize the \\"spin,\\" propaganda, that newer (or older) is not always truer, etc--and not be gulliblly seduced.  I also recommend this book for adults as an intro/icebreaker for studying argumentation or discernment.  Both Scieszka's story and Lane Smith's visuals are beginning to end funny.  And what fun to hear a child say, \\"hey, that's not how it goes!\\"
B000FMGTTE|5.0|Damn this soundtrack is awsome!!! I absoulutely LOVE IT!!! THE MOVIE WAS ALSO EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|This movie starts out very strongly.  Two men wake up in an old, isolated bathroom chained to pipes and with a dead body between them.  As they slowly start to figure out what's going on, they discover clues to a puzzle that they must get out of; if they don't in time, they'll die (in various ways).  It's all an elaborate scheme thought up by a serial killer named Jigsaw who's out to do something about people who don't appreciate their lives in the way he feels they should.<br /><br />The plot--and general creepiness and scare factor--are weakened once we start playing the \\"flashback and twist\\" game.  The doctor fellow knows who this killer is, because he used to be a suspect in the case... and thus the story gets told directly to us.  And from there the movie loses most of its power.  Instead of working out a great mystery over how this all came to be, we're just TOLD it (but with twists, see, because twists a good horror movie make).  Instead of being confined, literally, to this room to find all the clues, we're taken on asides to other characters, one of which was completely superfluous (Danny Glover's detective character... seriously, could have not been in the movie at all and probably wouldn't have changed anything).  And then we get some weird form of selective memory: \\"Oh gee, I just now remembered what happened to me yesterday!  Now that it's important for the audience to know!\\"<br /><br />So it's definitely not what I would call the most tightly wound thriller, but the premise is a very good one.  Knowing the way sequels work (and the fact that there are two already), I doubt they'll pump much more strength into the loose ends of this first one, so it's a shame that this great idea turned out pretty mediocre.<br /><br />However, it was fun to watch anyway.  It made up for superfluousness by inventing even more crazy traps and characters.  One scene was so full of glurge it was ridiculous: *Spoilers* \\"And did you?  Did you turn out a better person?\\"  \\"*Cries* He saved me!\\"  *End spoiler* I believe these situations would do a lot more to permanently damage people's lives than make them realize how important life is.  I think that's part of the point of having him, is that he has this great idea but is too insane to realize that it would backfire, and just ends up hurting and killing people.<br /><br />So ultimately, fun to watch, not the greatest slice of horror pie ever.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB\\"*Cries* He saved me!\\"  *End spoiler* I believe these situations would do a lot more to permanently damage people's lives than make them realize how important life is.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|Okay, so this is the third time George Lucas has released the Original Trilogy on DVD, and this time, he hit perfectly, but the so-called \\"fans'\\" responses have been just plain ridiculous! Let's review:  <br /> <br />First release: The Star Wars Trilogy is finally here on DVD in a four-disc set! <br />Fans' Responses: Yes!! But, they are the same altered versions as the Special Editions with even more \\"meaningless\\" changes. Flawless bonus disc. <br />My Response: Yes!! Personnaly, I'm glad that the altered versions were used. It wouldn't make any sense to release just the original versions by themselves on DVD. You never see something like THAT, do you? Great Bonus Disc. <br /> <br />Second Release: Same as previous, but without Bonus Disc. <br />Fans' responses: George just simply wants an extra dollar out of our pockets. What's with George taking the fourth disc out?! Give us the Theatrical Editions! <br />My Response:O-kay kind of a weird release, but is it a crime to legally make money? Why don't fans gripe at Peter Jackson for releasing a 2-disc King Kong set AND a single-disc Kong DVD? (FYI) George Lucas said he would never release the Theatrical Versions on DVD. Fans, get that through your skulls!!!  <br /> <br />Third Edition: Trilogy with both the Theatrical AND Special Editions. <br />Fans' responses: ABOUT TIME!!! I'm not going to buy the set AGAIN however. <br />My response: Good job Lucas!! You've taken what was already perfect, and improved it! Fans, George said he would never release the Theatrical Versions on DVD, but just for the fans, he's decided to do it. And what does he get? More insults. If I were George, due to the fan's opinion's, I would cancel production of the TV show and put Star Wars on the shelf. It's not like you didn't HAVE to buy the other releases and its not like you couldn't just sell what you have, and use the money for this release! <br /> <br /> <br />Conclusion: George Lucas has done fantastically over the years. Why am I even calling you people out there \\"fans\\"? Are you sure you like Star Wars? Most people said that both the Prequel Trilogy and the Special Editions were just unecessary or terrible or something like that. Could you guys do any better? It's Lucas's vision, not yours. Keep doing what you're doing Lucas!!! <br /> <br />

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Although the costumes, music and cinematography were all spectacular and certain scenes were well done (the ball scenes), this version is absolutely untrue to the story. Granted, they had limited amount of time for the movie duration, but I say it's better not to re-make it than to completely flub it. Certain things were great about this film, but Elizabeth was completely miscast, although I really like the acctress. And the movie focused on her (albeit beautiful) face the entire time, instead of developing the story more. I actually did laugh when I saw this movie in theater, especially the melodramatic ending. It was like watching a bad romance novel acted out.

B000HBK3MM|2.0|I like to think of myself as open minded musically, however in reading the reviews posted here, I am starting to wonder about myself. Now Corrinne can hold a tune (barely), but I don't believe she is worthy of the reviews listed here. She is NOT the second coming of neo-soul and she is certainly NOT doing anything revolutionary or avant garde. She is just OKAY!<br /><br />  I MIGHT listen to this CD if I were feeling a bit melancholy or if I were having an insomniac moment, but as far as being musically moving, I have to state contrary to the posts here. This girl is PURE MANUFACTURED UK POP, nothing more nothing less. What soul there is on this album, is lost between the obvious POP overtones. In terms of soul music, the UK is notorious for throwing down smooth groves (Hill Street Soul just to name one).<br /><br />  Further to compare, Corinne, to Billy, India, Erykah, Amel or even Sade is an insult. The aforementioned artists resonate SOUL, no matter the type of music they are singing; Corrine, unfortunately does not.<br /><br />  If you are into fat-free soul-lite, or watery Pop R and B, then this CD is definitely for you. If you are seeking to listen to music that touches your vertabrae, literally becoming part of your DNA, then pass she definitely is NOT in that category. I would rather listen to Joss Stone!
B000B8QG0O|4.0|This is a great DVD that our son loves to watch. I don't think it is as good as the original but sequels rarely are. It's certainly worth the purchase and has a lot of extras on the disc. I have seen it less expensive in other stores however.
0451191153|4.0|Ayn Rand wrote a fascinating albeit melodramatic novel in 1943 about an idealistic architect named Howard Roark and how he epitomized the concepts of individualism and objectivism in spite of the consternation it caused in others. In using architecture as the vehicle for her ideals, she concocted a hero whose ego reigns supreme and whose selfishness marks him as a true success in his field. This is bold thinking and probably quite antithetical to wartime sentiments, yet this book has understandably built a following over the years thanks to her near-Baroque style of defining her characters and their predicaments. In fact, it is really just the Baroque elements that Hollywood could understand in the well-remembered 1949 film adaptation starring Patricia Neal, Raymond Massey and Gary Cooper as Roark.<br /><br />The novel really follows the lives of five distinct characters who represent contrasting archetypes in Rand's philosophy. First, there is Roark, a supremely talented, uncompromising architect whose creative visions are at odds with those around him. On the opposite side is Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic who values mediocrity as a means to subdue the masses and allow Communism to infiltrate the country. In between Roark and Toohey is newspaper mogul Gail Wynand, whose rags-to-riches background has given him an unprecedented power to influence the masses. While he is Toohey's boss, Wynand gradually comes to admire Roark's individualism. A romantic triangle develops among Roark, Wynand and Dominique Francon, the headstrong daughter of a successful architect, whose attraction to Roark is mixed with self-loathing over what she envisions as his doomed visions. The fifth character is Roark's former classmate and rival architect Peter Keating, who is presented as a man devoid of ideals, more than willing to accommodate the masses to ensure his livelihood. While others may find the weak-willed Keating beneath contempt, he is also the most human of the quintet.<br /><br />The characters inevitably clash throughout, but Rand produces an exciting if rather far-fetched climax where Roark clandestinely designs a housing project for Keating under the condition that nothing change in his design. Of course, the design is significantly changed, and Roark takes matters into his own hands. It's irresistible fiction with a philosophical core that makes it seem more important than it is. Many Republicans claim the book is about one of their own, but such self-referential adoration misses the novel's main point, that Roark is a man who stands outside any recognized group. Rand deserves kudos for making such an arrogant character completely arresting throughout the book's marathon 752 pages.characters inevitably clash throughout, but Rand produces an exciting if rather far-fetched climax where Roark clandestinely designs a housing project for Keating under the condition that nothing change in his design.

B0002OERI0|1.0|First, I'd like to address Green Day's image change.  Notice how they started wearing black eyeliner and black clothes, and started appearing on the cover of every preteen heartthrob magazine.  If that's punk, then I feel sorry for what punk has become.  But it's not punk.  It's Hot Topic-Mall Goth-Emo-Poseur.  You can't call yourself punk when you go around and become a pop icon among preteen girls.  It just doesn't work like that.  In the words of Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, \\"They [Green Day] are definitely not punk.\\" <br /> <br />But of course, I'm not reviewing Green Day's image change, I'm reviewing their album, American Idiot.  Before I even get into anything else, I'd like to point out how bad the music itself is.  Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  Wow.  Not only is it ridiculously simple, but it's also ripped off from Oasis' \\"Wonderwall\\" and White Snake's \\"Here I Go Again.\\"  And if there's any better example to Green Day selling out and becoming emo, here it is.  It's as miserable as a song can get.  And Billie Joe's whiny voice certainly doesn't help the situation very much. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams is the extreme, though.  Everything that you could find wrong with a piece of music is encompassed in that song.  But the other songs are also very weak musically as well.  For fun, I tried to learn Boulevard, American Idiot, Holiday, and Wake Me Up on the guitar.  My experience on the guitar is...pretty much, knowing how to hold it and how to position my fingers correctly, and two or three chords.  Now what was I able to do for these songs?  I was able to learn the bulk of the songs very easily.  Wow, that's some nice musicianship, Green Day.  Way to go; I guess Billie Joe really is amazing with the guitar.  Oh wait, he's not even the lead guitarist, Jason White is.  I guess he doesn't have the mental capacity to play three power chords and sing at the same time. <br /> <br />Lastly, the lyrics.  I'm so sick of listening to these lyrics that I'mnot even going to point out all the individual problems with them.  But I'll name a few examples.  Boulevard of Broken Dreams is just whiny and annoying, and bares a funny similarity to the lyrics from Whitesnake's song (listed above).  Holiday...Well let's see, that compares Bush to Hitler.  Now, I'm no fan of Bush myself, but come on, Hitler?  That's just a pathetic stunt from a band that wants to gain some notoriety.  American Idiot...This is the most direct song on the entire album.  It lists all the problems with America and how terrible a place it is to live.  Once again, there is nothing original about these lyrics, and no \\"biting commentary\\" of American society.  Besides, I'd say America is treating them pretty damn well, huh? <br /> <br />Now for the multi-part songs.  Everyone likes to say this is a concept album or a rock opera.  I'd like to respond by saying, besides a common theme of \\"Aww, my life sucks,\\" this isn't a concept album.  And if I wanted to hear people whining about how their lives suck, I'd listen to emo music.  Oh wait, that's what Green Day has become.  There's a reason no official interpretation of American Idiot exists.  Because there's no story.  Everything is only loosely related because it tells a sketchy story about the same person.  I guess it could sort of be called a concept album in that sense, but really, it's a joke.  It's lyrically very weak, with nothing weak, nothing meaningful, and nothing worth interpreting. <br /> <br />If I wanted to hear people compare Bush to Hitler, I'd listen to Barbra Streisand.  At least she can sing.
B00005JP0A|4.0|I read the book and loved it. Because I live in the Midwest, this isn't exactly a world that I'm exposed to, and it's a blast joining this fashion frenzied crowd for a few hundred pages. The same can be said of the movie. It's fun while it lasts. And what makes it so much fun is, duh, Meryl Streep. No one can stop talking about how excellent she is in this, even Anne Hathaway admits that Meryl steals the show. And she does. She's a sharp-tongued, fashionista, editor bitch, whose claws are permanently out and scratching at the eyes of her assitants and, well, anyone else around her that doesn't do exactly what she wants exactly the way she says. <br /> <br />Hathaway plays Andrea, a bright-eyed college grad, who wants nothing more than to be a writer in NYC. How grand! She can't seem to get a writing job, but manages to snatch the job \\"a million girls would kill for\\"-- being the assitant to the demanding Miranda Priestly (Streep), editor of the hot and hip magazine called Runway. Andrea doesn't fit into this world of couture and makeup, a world where the new size 4 is a size 2, and size 6 (Andrea's size) is the new 14. Ouch. But Andrea is determined to stick it out, going so far as to alienate her boyfriend Nate (Adrien Grenier), her friends, her family, and herself, all so she can get her dream job-- because as everyone knows, one year serving Miranda means that she can hook you up with a job. ANYWHERE YOU WANT. <br /> <br />Anne Hathaway is, as always, a likable personality. What little we see of Grenier is pleasing, if for the simple fact that he's so adorably messy and cute. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci (as the cliche gay guy who helps the clueless girl, though Tucci OWNS this role) are the show stealers. And I can't not mention Simon Baker. Just because he's hot. Oh, and his character does manage to be effective in the few minutes they give him on screen. Great soundtrack, cute story, biting wit-- what more can a girl ask for?? Hm... maybe the new Marc Jacobsbag?? <br />
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a film everyone can enjoy, with pathos, humor, betrayal, and redemption--in essence, it's full of humanity.  Very well done, with a stellarr cst, I can watch it over and over.
B00009Y3L4|1.0|This edition is exactly the same one that was put out a few years ago with the original film poster logo on the front.  The only difference with this DVD, supposedly, is that it was enhcanced for WIDESCREEN tv, as it states on the rear cover.  Seems they haven't done a thing with the aspect ration for wide screen.  It just stretches out the  picture and gives Liza a lot more weight in her performance.  Warner Bros. DVD should check their words more carefully if they're going to re-issue something and not make any changes.  Otherwise, the film looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, even the orchestra is beautiful.....
B000000Y27|5.0|Wes Montgomery began playing the guitar at  the  relatively late age of 19, in 1942. His major influence was Charlie Christian. He played  with the Lionel Hampton Big Band for two years,1948-50 and was in essence self taught, along with this came a rather unorthodox technique using octaves  and chords in a very distinct way. These facts are all very fine,however the playing on this cd is incredible. Wes knows how to swing,phrase, and create interest with melodic shaping and improvisation of the highest order. He is more than ably supported by Percy Heath on Bass,Tommy Flanagan on piano and Albert Heath on drums.I bet many jazz guitarists  wish they could emulate his style ? The only criticism  of the production is that there is some distortion of sound with the guitar and piano solos. Surely, digital re-mastering would have solved this,in 1987? Otherwise, this is jazz guitar played with fire and soul. I play this cd  at every opportunity and do not tire of it. I thoroughly recommend this cd to any  jazz musician.
B00005JOQS|4.0|I knew nothing of Superman when I went to see this. Well, I knew he wore red and blue tights and could fly. I knew he loved Lois Lane. But I've never read the comics, never seen the old movies, never watched Lois and Clark or Smallville... my life was devoid of the man of steel. Now that I've been exposed to his world, I'm addicted. I thought nothing could be better than Spider-man and Batman, what other superheroes do you need when you have Spidey and the caped crusader?? I had no idea how complex the character of Superman actually was, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I could, indeed, become crazily obsessed with another superhero. <br /> <br />Superman Returns stars the amazing Brandon Routh as Superman/Clark Kent. Superman is back after having been gone for five years. He's lucky to get his old job at the Daily Planet back, where Jimmy happily greets him and gets him up to speed on everything he's missed, particularly the life of Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth)-- Superman's man squeeze who has since moved on. She even has a son and a permanent fiancee to prove it. But she really hasn't moved on; she's completely hung up on Superman, of course! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is planning to use crystals and kryptonite in his next scheme, hoping to kill Superman and create a new continent that will belong solely to, who else, himself.  <br /> <br />There's lots going on in this movie, as if the filmmakers were trying to make up for lost time in the Superman franchise. It loses points there. And the mis-use of Lane's child also loses points. The kid could've been an excellent plot device, as well as an engaging character, but he does little but sit and stare and look kinda creepy. But it's still a great movie. Full of action and romance and tortured souls.  <br /> <br />Routh is practically the poster boy of All-American goodness-- his bright smile and eyes, that perfectly coifed hair, that manly physique. He plays the role of Superman with just enough torture, just enough charisma, just enough cheesiness, that it works to perfection. Bosworth should've played the role of Lois with a bit more spunk. I love Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He's menacing and cold, but idiotic and funny. And Lex's girl Kitty (Parker Posey) is just plain hilarious, delivering the movies more lighter and funnier moments just when you need them.  <br /> <br />Awesome summer fare. Awesome anytime fare. One of the best superhero movies I've ever seen! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
006441034X|5.0|I bought this book after watching the movie (which is great too).  This book reads easy and takes some wonderful twists and turns.  Diana Wynne Jones' about crossing time and place periods is great.  A wonderful book for a reader of any age.
B000E8N9DS|2.0|As far as chic flicks go I am a die hard fan! But this chic flick made us chic's look quite simple and down right lame. Alright we have a divorced middle age woman who is not looking but gets placed back on the dating scene, not a far stretch you may say. However put a couple of dogs in the middle along with horrible supporting roles in between and there you have it. This movie leaves you with no one to truly route for. Where this movie fails is the fact that the characters are boring and the storyline lacks depth. As far as date movie goes skip Must Love Dogs unless you must love torturing yourself through the pain of the ever predictable middle aged quest for love.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This cd is one of the best cd's i have heard in a while. That C. Wilson fellow is wrong about the hidden track. It is the hidden track for those who downloaded it and got an advanced copy. I can tell that this person did not buy the cd cause the hidden track is actually Paper Wings (Live) which is an awesome live performance! I bought mine at target so MAYBE its different if you buy it at different places. I personally think that \\"The Approaching Curve\\" is an amazing song. It is like a story about a break up and what they go through. As the song progresses it breaks into an awesome chorus. There are several songs on here that are equally as amazing, for example, behind closed doors, injection, and the prayer of the refugee. Overall, an amazing cd that should be bought. It is well worth the price that amazon has listed here. Even if you have downloaded the advanced copy, you should still buy the cd, it is THAT good!
B00005JOQS|5.0|I saw this in IMAX on Canada day (in 3D) it was totally f _ [king awesome! Pure fun and action, and Kate Bosworth is a total hottie! And great 3D effects aswell.<br /><br />PLOT: Clark Kent has returned. He is given his job back and finds out that Lois Lane has written an editorial about why the world dosen't need Superman. He later finds out that she has a new boyfriend, and Lex Luther has returned with a new crystal lair. While Lois is on the flight, It is in danger of crashing so Sperman stops it (the 2nd part in IMAX 3D). One day, Lois and her son are taken away on Lex's ship. Superman must save her!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: 10x better than expected. The best way to see it is in IMAX, which is how I saw it. You're in for one helluva ride when seeing it.<br /><br />So see this movie!

B00097DXZS|3.0|Dear Carlos,<br /><br />As a long-time hard-core base fan, I have to write you this letter.  You have a large core group of us out here who have been with you since Ballin', the lost single of '67, we were your west-coast oh-my-god-did-you-hear-that-guitar-sing??? tongue-lolling eye-popping rabid-slavering fans who couldn't get enough Santana Band to fill our patched blue jeans!  We're still out here Carlos!  When are you going to release one last (at the very least) \\"Santana\\" album?  Man!  We been with you through the three great break-through classic rock albums (bam! bam! bam!), through Diamond Head's funk-rock with Buddy Miles, through the amazing jazz-rock experimentation of Caravanserai, Welcome, and Borboletta, through the introspective experimentation of Jazz Fusion with Mahavishnu John and Alice Coltrane.  We were simply blown away when you followed up the Latino-Jazz-Rock sensibilities of Amigos and Festival with the jaw-dropping Moonflower.  We followed you around the corner and into the 80's with Inner Secrets, Marathon, the almost Abraxas-like Zebop! and even Shango.  We did a double-take again with Havana Moon (wow, this really IS good stuff!) and your own personal favorite Blues for Salvador (album for your wife, title track for your son, and most-beautiful instrumental for your daughter).  We resurrected you with Spirits Dancing In The Flesh (I believe Carlos! I believe!) and Milagro (another jaw-dropping album, my God you never cease to amaze!) and we even caught hold of your familial album, Brothers (now THAT's a 90's experiment!), and then you shot the moon with Supernatural.  I was amazed, yes I was, this is cool, Carlos has a whole new audience and he managed to not isolate his oldest fan-base, he even hid a long-awaited duet with the other guitar-god at the end, wow, I was just silly with enjoyment.  Honeymoon is finally over Carlos.  Shaman?  You stretched it a bit trying it out a second time, and yeah I know the new kids love ya, but all I REALLY liked after several listens, was the (what I thought was truely avante...) inspirational \\"Novus\\" with Placido Domingo at the voice.<br /><br />All That I Am?

You've managed to do this three times with big bang sales and I'm sure you are re-invigorated (as you well should be) with the youth of it all, but Carlos, the Angels of MY better nature are beckoning to you, give us a Santana album please, not another variety show.

Carlos and Deborah posted a disclaimer on their website the instant they found out about it and urge everyone to contact Sony with your displeasure.\\"<br /><br />So that's my advice Carlos, your people want YOU back, at least for one more go-round if not a few.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I was really scared of buying this dvd through the internet because I live in Argentina, but it all came out great. The product arrived really soon with the medium shipment, and it arrived in excelent conditions, all wraped up, for security. The RENT movie is excelent, I cant stop watching it, the songs are the best, the artist have great voices. And the documental \\"No day but Today\\" is really emotional, is very interesting to watch and to know the story of Jonathan Larsson. Thanks Amazon.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Alright my friends: Stop screaming reviews without viewing the actual 2 DVD Set to release next July 10. I already have it and I'm going to post a complete review for you:    First of all, let me say ya the long awaited Pulse DVD is well worth the wait. When a DVD is good enough you feel the need for more and more, that's what happened to me with Pulse after first experienced complete, including extras.    I don't think it's useful to write about the concert, isn't it?. Everybody knows it and all I have to say it's a stunning and landmark performance, better than Pulse CD. The band is inspired, the music sounds like heaven, and the marriage between stage-lights-screen and the band is beyond perfection.    So let's review about the DVD:    It's presented on 4:3 aspect, remastered and re-edited. That's true, I can notice several differences with the VHS footage, and I think they were right. The remastering is quite amazing, colours are rich, strong and brilliant. Some cameras show a cleaner angles than other ones, and from the worst ones you can notice some pixelations and softness (I think impossible to remove given the nature of the filming tapes, for Video at that time). Hands down for the direction: AT LAST YOU WON'T FIND A MTV CLICHED DVD!!!!. When you want to see the band playing...you see the band playing without distracting artefacts as the stupid and annoying 100 camera changes per second. The filming is elegant, and it's according to the music played. Also the cameras allow you, unlike Pompeii, to have a wide vision of the band, instrument, stage, venue, etc. Simply fantastic work and a lesson for every music DVD director.    The sound is the holy grail of the DVD. Outstanding, impressive, awesome. You actually feel like being there. It does sound live, and you can clearly notice the instruments, voices and sound effects!. Listen to that Gilmour solo on Comfortably Numb is the quintessential DVD experience. Loss for words, really the sound left me speechless.    Now why Am I giving this 4 stars?. Because of the lack of interesting extras. First of all, the screenfilms looks amazing...but they were put into a circled format, I mean, you can watch them like if you were watching the real screen on stage. What a pity!, I wish I had a full screen format of every film, especially High Hopes, the best ever Pink Floyd video. The sound of the screenfilms are from the concert.    The Say Goodbye... docummentary is quite short (15 minutes) and uninspired, boring. Nothing to take care about. I wish I watched revealing interviews, high quality footage (the footage used is rather poor), rearshals, etc.    The Bootlegs section is the most dissapointing stuff from the set: low quality audience mix from 3-4 cameras each song. After watching and listening to the magnificence of the main concert, watching and listening to the bootlegs is pretty much like a suicide. They should have put high quality audio of those songs instead, I know they have them!. Also there's no Astronomy Domine, sorry friends.    The Booklet is rather small, but nice.     Overall, the main concert is the reason alone to buy this DVD. I strongly believe that the extras on Classic Albums: Dark Side Of The Moon were more instructive and useful than the extras presented here. Except for the studio videos, the rest is forgettable. Anyway, the presentation of the main concert and the watching and listening experience is uplifting.     Unless we'll get the long awaited and asked Pink Floyd The Wall Live DVD (Roger still has the tapes hidden in his closet with dust!) this is the holy grail of Pink Floyd DVD's. High Hopes

B000FGGE68|4.0|Even for a CGI movie, had scenes that could use a little more \\"real world\\" effects rather than going fully digital. Seeing Milla in any movie is actually quite a pleasure(except Joan of Arc) So basicly I would say that this movie is good entertainer, dont expect deep plot or twists, no oscars for acting either, just plain rollercoaster action(with some dull moments also)
B00006J3T4|5.0|For many reasons, my favourite album in a body of lifetime achievement that defies having a definitive favourite effort. I suppose the seeming strength here of acoustic accompaniment - even when it's electric, it sounds like wooden music, as Stephen Stills so aptly dubbed acoustic music at woodstock (and now you know I'm old) - is the attraction here for me, although I've been known to crank the volume, open the window, and blow pedestrians off the shoulder with \\"Why Aye Man\\" on my way home from work. There's a lot going on in \\"Hillfarmer's Blues\\" - a lot more, in continued listenings, than it quietly conveys at first - Mark's own Every Breath You Take, as it were. Think about what the guy is going into town for - razor wire, weed killer, shotgun shells. And saw blades.  He's not only going to take care of the cheater when he comes home, he's going to chop up the remains. It gets creepier every time I listen to it. And then two songs later is possibly the quirkiest of Mark's compositions, \\"Quality Shoe\\". I can't imagine what inspired that unless it was another \\"Money For Nothing\\" moment with him lurking in the aisles eavesdropping on conversations again.As I said, there is no clear favourite here - I love every song. \\"You Don't Know You're Born\\" speaks to people who are the armchair experts of the world; I'm not entirely convinced that \\"Coyote\\" is really about the Roadrunner, although I've decided over the years that you really can take Mark Knopfler's work at face value sometimes, and not read too much into it (sometimes a ham sandwich is a ham sandwich); I can just imagine the conversation that inspired \\"Daddy's Gone To Knoxville\\", and the song fairytale of \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\" is a quiet gem. This is just the nicest album, perfect for taking one's mind off one's own troubles.

B000001GF9|5.0|Save for a number of scattered recordings over the decades (including an impressive take on the composer's Requiem), Leonard Bernstein wasn't necessarily known as a Mozart conductor, nor as a choral conductor; his pallet tended to include giants like Mahler and Copland, to name just two.  But when he did venture into choral music, he did come off on the winning end of the ledger. <br /> <br />Such is the case with this recording he made for Deutsche Grammophon in April 1990 of three vocal/choral works by the great Wolfgang.  The first is the much-beloved \\"Ave Verum Corpus\\" for organ, string orchestra, and chorus that Mozart wrote while basically on his death bed in December 1791.  And although it is the work of a dying young man, it is also the work of a young man whose spirit would live on.  Second is the motet \\"Exsultate Jubilate\\", a fairly early work of the composer for soprano soloist and small orchestra (ornamented with a harpsichord, indicitive of a holdover from the Baroque era).  Arleen Auger is the soprano soloist here, and she is at her usual best. <br /> <br />Auger is then joined by mezzo Frederica von Stade, tenor Frank Lopardo, bass Cornelius Hauptmann, and organist Friedemann Winklhofer for Mozart's admittedly fragmentary but still impressive Great Mass in C Minor (believed to be his 17th and final setting of the Latin Mass).  Scored for a fairly significant-sized orchestra, including three trombones, it is a work of immense power that takes a lot out of not only the vocal soloists, but also the orchestra, the chorus, and the conductor. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Bernstein, even here, just seven months before his own death, is up to the task, as are the forces of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus (the same forces he had for his incredible '88 Mozart Requiem).  Although he admittedly does go for a marathon pace in part of the Gloria section, for the most part Bernstein takes his time to bring out the power of this piece.  The all-star vocal soloists are all at their professional best, and the recording (made live in the same cathedral as Bernstein's Mozart Requiem recording) is another first-rate one for the Deutsche Grammophon engineers. <br /> <br />An impressive recording for all concerned, and as one of Bernstein's valedictory recordings, this is an epic recording to be treasured by all.
B0000VCZKW|4.0|Matilda finds the balance between sentimental and dark, between happy and depressing.  The sadness of Matilda's childhood in a dysfunctional family full of crooks and her prison-like school experience, is made better in the end when she finds a loving home.  Because the movie is based on a Raold Dahl book of the same name, there is plenty of darkness to balance out the (predicatable) happy ending.<br /><br />Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman were great in their roles as Matilda's slimy, ignorant parents.  Mara Wilson was perfect in the title role; a real joy to watch.<br /><br />Matilda's a great film for kids 6 and up.  It's the type of movie your kids might watch over and over again.
078322818X|4.0|This film was a deserved success and a revolutionary approach in film making. It integrated songs into the story and created a product that was greater than the sum of its parts. It observed the classical unity of time, place, and action. The small town where it is set may now be as obsolete as 25 cent gasoline. Downtown small businesses are mostly gone. Its simple story is really a glorified version of 1962 memories, which were not likely the \\"happy days\\" shown, except in retrospect. There were a lot of changes since 1962. <br /> <br />The story is about some high school students who are graduating. Some will go on to college and have a bright future possible in those times. Others will remain and work in middle-class jobs like small businesses. No mention of the agriculture in that area. There are a few hard cases who will meet the police in their professional duties. The 1960s represented the best years of their lives for most people, as measured by the wealth of ordinary people. The story plays upon the ignorance and lack of experience of teenagers, compared to what they will know in a few years. Education isn't always taught, it often must be learned. The entertainment comes from the seeming naive comments from teenagers who find themselves in tight spots. Its filmed from a teenager's viewpoint, adults appear as obstacles or in the background. Its locale appears before the Federal and state highway systems eliminated isolated rural areas with two-lane blacktops. <br /> <br />A follow-up film was made showing many of the characters years later. Some are married with children. \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\" compressed people's lives into one film. Could a third sequel be made? Yes, but it would not be a success because it would remind people of realities best left unmentioned. The early 1970s were not \\"happy days\\" after the devaluation of the dollar. <br />

Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down and ended up reading it within a day or two. <br /> <br />It has its predictable moments, but all in all, it's a great story and makes you itch to get your hands on the next books in the trilogy.
B00005JOQS|3.0|I remember seeing Superman, The Movie several times in the movie theatre.  A wee bit too young to have a crush on the hero (I was 12), I enjoyed watching it for it's fabulous special effects (I believed a man could fly). <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Superman II, this time with a bit more appreciation for the man in tights, being about 15.  My main crush in the world was Han Solo, but a super strong hero with such a gentle heart was a huge romantic draw. <br /> <br />What I always loathed was the fact that Clark kissed Lois and made her forget their whole affair.  Even back in the day, even in my young and innocent state of mind and body, I was affronted by the idea of someone doing that to someone. It seemed a violation even then, and now, with all the date rape drugs out there - it seems even more of a violation to this 40 year old woman. <br /> <br />I don't like my hero to have feet so heavily laden with clay that he can't take off.  Not Superman.   <br /> <br />I won't even discuss III and IV.  IV may have had some amount of redeeming qualities (sans the Nuk-u-lar man garbage) but from what I understand, the best parts of the movie were left on the cutting room floor. <br /> <br />This new take on my old favorite intrigued me.  I enjoyed Brandon as Superman and was touched by how he uttered lines from the originals - 'Statistically speaking, it's still the safest way to travel' - even if it was banal and hokey.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed Bosworth as Lois, although she isn't Margot Kidder. Few people are. <br /> <br />Spacey as Luthor and Posey as his henchwoman were brilliant. <br /> <br />What wasn't brilliant was the implications behind the parentage of Lois's son.  If this truly takes off from Superman II, Lois should have no idea how she managed to end up pregnant with Superman's child - a concern I had back in 1981 - what if she ended up pregnant? <br /> <br />I'm thinking most women would be horrified and angry at the idea of having no memory of being intimate with someone -even someone like him.  In fact, one might suspect that it was a Kryptonian thing - sleep with women and make them forget about it.  Yet no implication of menace-felt was made.  Lois was angry that he left, but that's about it. <br /> <br />So I'm hoping that there is a slight retconning here of the story. Lois and Superman had a fling, but all he made her forget was the part where he's Clark Kent. <br /> <br />Again, I'm just not sure.  In Superman IV, he gives her her memory back just for one flight so he can basically complain and whine to her about how things aren't fair - and then he takes them away again.  Violation, clear and not-so-simple. <br /> <br />So the movie gets 3 stars. Mostly for the whole unanswered and uncomfortable hole in the plot, and also for the bits which plodded.  <br /> <br />Two nits: <br /> <br />1) How could Lois even find him in the murky water?  <br /> <br />2) How did Clark hurl a kryptonite laced island out of Earth's orbit? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />What I didn't like was the implication

B0007XT7V8|4.0|Well, I have to admit..it's a really good album, however my favorite song \\"No Surprise\\" is indeed censored. It's the only song that happens to be censored on the album. Unfortunately there is no explicit version of it. To hear the better uncensored version you have to buy the \\"No surprise\\" single..oh well.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but there's just no other way to describe it.  Absolutely charming, \\"Life is Beautiful\\" will keep you spellbound.  Guido's exuberance and zest for life, regardless of the circumstances in which he finds himself, make a profound and lasting impression.   <br /> <br />I initially shyed away because of the hype surrounding all of the Academy Awards it won, but upon seeing it, immediately realized why it won and wondered why it didn't get Best Picture as well.   <br /> <br />You won't regret taking the time to watch this one!  If you possibly can, the Italian version (with subtitles) is beautiful.  It loses just a little bit in translation when you watch the English version, the jokes change a little, but it's stil wonderful.  Because of this movie, I bought Andrea Bocelli's version of Barcarolle (Offenbach) and Mario Frangoulis' \\"Sometimes I Dream\\" album for the \\"Buongiorno Principessa\\" track.
B0001926TS|5.0|Combine Dido's clear, emotional voice with excellent production values and the result is marvelous music. While it is easy to compare Dido with artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sinead O'Conner, Dido has her own style.<br /><br />This CD opens with \\"Here with Me,\\" a heartfelt song of longing and love. The delicate music with Dido's soulful voice sends shivers down my spine. This song is haunting, ethereal and emotional, establishing the theme for this CD.<br /><br />The delicacy is gone with the feral song \\"Hunter.\\" Dido has gone from singing about the person she wants to be with to telling someone that she wants to be on the hunt again. Dido's voice is quiet, yet assured. She is asking him to let her go, yet you sense from the vocals that she will leave him eventually, with or without his approval. She is the hunter.<br /><br />The third track is after the breakup. The lyrics seem a bit strange after the heartfelt vocals of longing in the first song and the cat on the prowl strength of the third song. In this song she is more simpering and petty and thinking way too much about him. Given the strength of character in the first two songs, this song seems out of place.<br /><br />The next song, \\"My Lover's Gone,\\" brings Dido back on track, singing about the loss of her lover. The lyrics are poignant and mournful. The emotion she brings to her voice matches the lyrics well. The haunting instruments supporting the vocals are in sync rather than counterpoint. The music and instruments are delicate and misty, with a Celtic quality to them, and the song has an airy new age style.<br /><br />Keeping with melancholy themes is a song to a departed lover in \\"All You Want.\\" The harmonies and lyrics are the highlight of this composition. Dido laments the loss of her lover, but she does not accept that he left for another woman.  She says that he made his bed, and he can sleep in it. As in most of the previous songs she remains, while upset and regretful, in control.<br /><br />\\"Thank You\\" did well on the charts, and is a pretty song about how someone can brighten a person's life. Dido's vocals are electronically manipulated to increase the complexity of this song, with overdubs and echo. This pop song is bright and friendly and has a catchy beat that combine to make this one of the most radio friendly songs on the CD.<br /><br />Getting back to a more melancholy tone is \\"Honestly OK.\\" The topic is loneliness and feeling the need to share life with someone. There is a sharp beat to this song that shows some hip-hop influence, though not in the vocals. This song turns depression into emotional art.<br /><br />\\"Slide\\" brings to mind Sade. The sumptuous mellow vocal overlays and style are reminiscent of some of Sade's music. Once again Dido's voice takes charge of the song and the subject, which is dealing with mistakes and the tribulations of life. The electronic touches are subdued and supportive and provide an interesting and unique feel. The drums retain just a touch of island beat, again similar to some of Sade's music. However, this song is Dido's.<br /><br />The ninth track is melancholic, and yet the song keeps itself above a maudlin level to provide an enjoyable listening experience. \\"Isobel\\" is about love, regret and quiet resentment. It is amazing that Dido can sing about loving someone who is in the process of going away, but that is where she found strength to carry on.<br /><br />\\"I'm no Angel\\" says that regardless of whether she is an angel, she tries hard to do the right thing. The lyrics are interesting and well performed. However, it seems that the vocal style is less in charge and Dido seems to struggle just a little to keep up with the instruments. Because of the power of the other songs on this CD we know she has the ability, so it is perception rather than fact. The result is that this track is vocally one of the weaker tracks on this CD.<br /><br />Dido reasserts herself lyrically and vocally in \\"MyLife.\\" Dido could have sang this song with a regretful tone, as though she is breaking up with someone or has differences with someone that are causing her to do something she does not want to do. Instead she says she does what she does because she is in charge of herself. The steady beat is assured and is beautifully and quietly executed. This song seems to reflect Dido's true personality, which shows up in earlier songs. Perhaps this song also dares anyone to criticize her music, advising everyone that this music is who she is and she cares not what anyone says about it.<br /><br />\\"Take My Hand\\" is a deep song, expressing the empathy that someone can have for another for whom they care deeply. When you are that deeply in love with someone there can be no lies because the emotions are plain to see; a wonderful and pretty song with a fast beat that proclaims the depths love can achieve. The music and the vocals in this song are strong to underscore the strength of the singer's love.<br /><br />Listen to this album without distractions, because these songs are emotional and complex. The music is beautiful, the lyrics are well written. The few moments of weakness are well outweighed by the strength of the remaining songs. This excellent album is for those who like Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and possibly Enya.<br /><br />There are several versions of this CD, with various prices and availability.  This particular version offers two bonus tracks over the version currently available in the United States, but with a substantially greater price.  I recommend seeking a more reasonably priced version unless you absolutely need this version for your collection.ally and vocally in \\"My Life.\\" Dido could have sang this song with a regretful tone, as though she is breaking up with someone or has differences with someone that are causing her to do something she does not want to do.

Gladwell is terriffic - in my opinion the best - at making his research come alive through his convincing writing style. He gives great insight into how we think, great statistics and studies to support his theories, and ultimately - as only he can - makes the light bulb go off over your head. If you like smart, well researched and convincing books... read Blink.
0143036556|5.0|Diamond's premise here is \\"societies collapse when they use up their resources beyond sustainability\\"  I have already been to and/or studied to a very limited, amateur extent: China, the Norse colonies, Iceland, and the American Southwest modern and ancient civilizations, so most of Diamond's examples were of regions and/or societies with which I had some familiarity.  And reading the book while visiting huge sprawling Phoenix, Arizona, during a gas price increase made me wonder how much we Americans have already moved beyond sustainability of our lifestyle compared the the earth's resources.  <br /> <br />The groups who seem most unable to deal with possible problems are those who fall into some extreme - either communist USSR and China (socialist Iceland is one of the success stories) - or extreme capitalism (those businesses which grab only the most immediate dollar and walk away from the consequences) - or extreme theocracies. Diamond does postulate and give examples of a moderate middle ground, wherein individuals make choices that are good for themselves as well as for all of society (how John Nash of him!)   <br /> <br />Diamond combines a great amount of anthropological and archeological research with his own experience and anecdotal evidence.  He definitely has an environmentalist background, but does not value \\"pretty trees\\" over feeding human beings. He is not an alarmist, but he does project a future wherein we Americans will certainly see enforced lifestyle changes, with greater or lesser severity based on our own willingness to adapt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

067942850X|4.0|Krakauer has an impressive writing style and an amazing ability to piece together clues to a puzzle for which there is no certain conclusion. Much like Junger/Perfect Story, Krakauer uncovers amazing detail as he follows the odd journey of a lost young man that mysteriously walks into the wild one day and never returns. Much different read from Krakauer/Into Thin Air as this is not a first-hand account and the subject is far less inspirational. If you like Krakauer though, you will like this book.
B00005JP4U|5.0|I saw it on the Fourth of July, 2006. The documentary and its narrator Vice President Al Gore are totally credible ... and over the past few days several major scientists have endorsed the movies conclusions as accurate, and the facts irrefutable. Moreover, no scientific opposition has been recorded to date.  <br /> <br />The only vocal criticism has come from vested interests who see the documentary as an attack on their monetary profits...and from the talking-heads whom they pay to spew catchy one-liners like, \\"Global Warming is merely a THEORY\\".... <br /> <br />NOW, WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THE DOCUMENTARY AND DESIGN STRATEGIES TO MAKE THIS SUBJECT THE CENTER-PIECE OF THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. Candidates for every elective office from Dog-catcher to President should be required to link their promises to the environmental issues relevant to the offices they seek...and, there ARE issues relevant to every elective office! <br /> <br />The concluding credits of the documentary summarize the MANY, MANY ways in which we can act...personal actions as well as  national policy. If you have not seen the movie, you will be short changing yourself if you start to walk out when the credits roll. This is a very cleverly designed summary, and has many practical follow up steps from personal action to national strategy. Please sit through and tell others to wait and read the concluding comments... <br /> <br />My only negative comment is that while the movie-makers incorporated the summary very cleverly and artfully in the closing credits, they wrongly presumed that movie-goers will stay and watch. They missed the fact that Americans normally run out of the theater as soon as credits start to roll!
B00004WEJZ|3.0|True, Connery isn't as good as 007 as he was in the 1960s but HE IS better in this movie than he was in Diamonds Are Forever, his last \\"official\\" Bond movie. In Diamonds Are Forever, it seemed like Connery couldn't give less of a ****. Yeah, yeah I know Connery was sick and tired of playing Bond by the time Diamonds Are Forever came around, but the fact that Connery was being paid one of the highest salaries in movie history to appear in Diamonds Are Forever made his lack of effort in Diamonds Are Forever inexusable. In Never Say Never Again, even though it wasn't a \\"real\\" Bond movie, at least Connery did make a decent effort. Connery also seemed to be putting on some weight in Diamonds Are Forever. Considering Connery is 12 years older in Never Say Never Again than he was in Diamonds Are Forever, Connery is in pretty good physical shape in Never Say Never Again. Connery was, however, getting kind of old and wrinkly and, like I said, he's not as good as 007 as he was a couple decades before, but he really was no worse than Roger Moore was at that time-to tell you the truth, I would have rather had Connery in 1985's View To A Kill, Roger Moores last Bond movie, than Roger Moore.
B00005V9HH|5.0|First time directors rarely do all that great with their first movie, but sometimes a director comes along that breaks the rules, and makes an incredible first film.  Bryan Singer is just such a director, in recent years he's become well known among comic book fans as one of the best directors to bring their favorite heroes to life in a long time, this is because of his films \\"X-Men\\", \\"X2:  X-Men United\\" and the recent release \\"Superman Returns\\".  Before Singer became known as the man that rejuvenated the comic book movie genre, he directed an incredibly taut, thriller with so many twists and turns that it still leaves audiences guessing to this day.  Of course, the movie I'm talking about is \\"The Usual Suspects\\" starring Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and Stephen Baldwin. <br /> <br />\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is about a band of small-time criminals who are gathered together one night for a police line-up and while in holding conspire together to pull off a one-time job that requires 5 men to make it a success.  Led by Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), and brilliantly planned by Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey) this band of criminals pulls off the job without a hitch, and brings down a ring of corrupt cops in the process.  After the job is finished, Keaton tries to walk away from his life of crime, but the allure of even bigger jobs brings him back in.  Just when things were looking good for this band of criminals a man representing the crime lord Keyser Soze, a crime lord whom many believe to be nothing more than a myth amongst criminals, contacts them.  Keyser wants these criminals to pull off a job for him as payback for crimes they committed in their past, crimes that just so happened to interfere with plans Soze had in place for his own gains.  Now, this band of criminals must decide whether to pay off their debt to Keyser Soze, or refuse him and live out the rest of their lives on the run from death at Keyser Soze's hands. <br /> <br />Boasting an incredibly talented cast of actors, a twisted storyline that will leave you scratching your head as you struggle to understand everything you've just seen, and an excellent first-time director who shocked Hollywood with this impressive thrill ride.  \\"The Usual Suspects\\" is most definitely one of those rare Hollywood gems that when it comes along you can't help but pay attention.  Many people have said that this is one movie that once you've seen it, you really can't watch it again to just enjoy it because all of the surprise is gone.  I happen to disagree with these people, the fun in watching this movie during repeat viewings is not the shocking ending, it's trying to piece everything together and catching all of the clues that you miss the first time around. <br /> <br />Though the movie sometimes moves slow, though not very often, and these times serve as a nice breather from the mental games being played out in the film, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable movie that is way more than simple eye candy, but will provoke you to think about what you're watching. <br /> <br />\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00005JP4U|4.0|Despite what you may think of Al Gore and/or the concept of global warming, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is a compelling and eminently lucid exposition of the latter, and Al doesn't come off too shabbily either. Is the former \\"next President of the United States\\" planning on running again? That's probably not his overt intention. But if the Democratic kingmakers came on bended knee (\\"Al, only you can save The Republic!\\" or, even better, \\"Al, only you can save Earth!\\"), would he say \\"no\\"? (Already I'm seeing bumper stickers at the local Democratic Party booths, \\"The Democrats will solve global warming!\\" Gee, you think?)<br /><br />Sprinkled with folksy childhood reminiscences and mea culpas about the Gore family's previous misguided participation in tobacco farming , AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is a slick visual presentation comprised of photographs, video, and scientific data graphs, by which Al will make you believe - if you don't already - that the world as we know it is doomed by the ever increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Disastrous climate changes, the resurgence of old diseases and the emergence of new afflictions, melting ice, and rising sea levels that will spur massive population migrations are all in the offing over the next 100 years. Lawdy, lawdy, Miz Sca'lett, whatever is we to do?<br /><br />AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is the first film I've ever seen where the ending credits incorporate exhortations to do PC stuff. \\"Recycle\\"; I do. \\"Drive a hybrid\\"; I would but the price mark-up negates what I'd save on gas. \\"Take public transport\\"; I did but gave it up because it morphed my 90-minute round trip to and from the 9 to 5 to 180 minutes. \\"Use energy efficient appliances\\"; I do because the city pays installation rebates. \\"Set the thermostat at 82\\"; I do because my wife makes me. \\"Vote for candidates that support the Kyoto Agreement\\"; I would if the crooks will otherwise stay out of my wallet. \\"Plant trees\\"; cool, I could use the firewood. The movie doesn't reveal if Al follows any or all of these precepts. However, he does, apparently, expend a lot of jet fuel gallivanting about on international junkets presenting his slide show. Couldn't he just video conference the thing via satlink? As our hero of the piece says, the technology is there.<br /><br />At one point, Gore uses data from ice cores to plot the Earth's average temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide level over the past 160,000 years before extrapolating such over the next couple of generations. (By the way, nice job operating the power lift, Al, but a simple ladder would have consumed no electricity.) But he doesn't put this into the perspective of time. The globe is now thought to be about 4.5 billion (that's \\"billion\\" with a B) years young, over which period the Earth on its own, and without human help, has exterminated countless species with the ostensible connivance of the occasional meteor impact. Presumably, until the Sun goes supernova, the Earth will last a few more years - millions and millions by my guess - while presiding over the eradication of even more life forms including perhaps our own.<br /><br />Al's perspective is homocentric, i.e., there's the implication that Homo sapiens as a species has the God-given right to infest the planet in perpetuity, and any serious impediment to that, such as man-made global warming, is unethical. The past and future Earth is perhaps above any such human morality construct. If, as Gore has convinced me, global warming ultimately results in the most dire consequences imaginable - elevated oceans, apocalyptic climatic shifts, massive population migrations, famines, wars, and pestilences - a resilient Mother Earth will ultimately reset itself, with or without human riders, after the greenhouse gases settle. Indeed, I'd expect a new Ice Age in about 20,000 years - and a real doozy at that; stock up on warm knickers now. So, feel free to do all that PC stuff if it makes you feel like a responsible citizenof the world. In the long, long, long, very long run, it makes no difference.<br /><br />Hillary is probably kicking herself for not having such a vehicle to elbow her way into the public eye pending the 2008 presidential contest. Unfortunately for her, she'll never be as congenial a scold as the ex-Veep., long, very long run, it makes no difference.

B000002GC2|5.0|I've owned this on LP for many years, and at different points I've pulled this record out for a good listen. Last night, I was going through my records and decided to give it a go. This music is great! So many of the world's finest musicians here, including Herbie Hancock, Steve Lukather, Ian Underwood, and Stevie Wonder. This music I would even say has a strong jazz and funk element to it, and certainly many of the arrangements are more complex than much of the music played either in 1981 or today.  <br /> <br />Every song here is a classic, and two of the tracks \\"Just Once\\" and \\"One Hundred Ways\\" are among the best-loved pop hits of the early 80's. \\"Ai No Corrida\\" and the title track are my favorites, though. They are hip, and there is plenty of instrumental meat behind the catchy vocals. If you like Steely Dan, Toto, early Michael Jackson albums, I think you will find a lot to enjoy here. Thanks for reading my review.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|If you are new to UFO..., this is where you start your collection(you WILL buy more). Everyone has weighed in on the Michael Schenker saga and has their own opinion. This album can be reviewed very simply, it is the \\"BEST OF\\" the Schenker era pre Walk On Water. <br />As everyone says, the playing on this set is incredible. Every song is tight and Schenker does indeed let loose with some jaw dropping guitar work. <br />The thing that is remarkable about this album is the production and sound quality. The songs have much more energy and \\"oompf\\" than the studio versions. I have yet to come across a better sounding live recording, and remember when this was made. <br />If you like pure engines open rock n roll - BUY THIS.

It was fascinating to get a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to bring a Broadway show from conception to opening night.

B000063DGC|3.0|Great live stuff but the recording quality stinks. I went to a few of these tours and could have gotten better quality with an old stereo Sony Walkman recorder.
B0006ZFQP8|5.0|Having listened to a number of recordings of Wagner's masterpiece over the years, Carlos Kleiber's remains one of my top two favorites. The other being Karl Böhm's version also for Deutsche Grammophon (now both in their cheaper Original-series). Kleiber's version was recorded in the studio and therefore misses some of the excitement of Böhm's (very) live recording. On the other hand, the studio recording allows Kleiber's singers to pay great attention to detail. Margaret Price for Kleiber is in glorious voice and gives a ravishing, very feminine portrayal of Isolde, though I doubt if she were able to sing the role like this in the theater. Nilsson for Böhm certainly had the capacity to sing Isolde in theater and her portrayal for Böhm probably remains one her most stunning achievements on record. Nilsson sings the Liebestod as if it were one of the first scenes in the opera. Nina Stemme for Pappano is also highly recommendable and one of many reasons to give a listen to Pappano's version, probably the best modern version. Hildegard Behrens is one of my favorite sopranos in this kind of repertoire, but her portrayal is marred by Bernstein's lethargic conducting. Brigitte Fassbaender, probably best-known for her interpretation of songs by Schubert, Mahler, etc. is wonderful as Brangäne, and her unique voice contrasts nicely to Price's. Ludwig for Böhm is great, but then she never disappoints. René Kollo for Kleiber sings the role of Tristan well, though I do not care for his voice. I rather listen to Wolfgang Windgassen for Böhm or Placido Domingo for Pappano. Domingo's German may be unidiomatic in comparison to Kollo and Windgassen, but he understands the role well and to have such a beautiful voice singing Tristan is quite a treat. Both Kleiber and Böhm give an urgent reading of the piece, Böhm even more so probably due to the live occassion. If there only can be one version of Tristan und Isolde in your collection, I probably would choose Böhm's for theconducting, Nilsson's stunning Isolde (the best on record in my opinion) and the fact that it was recorded live at the Bayreuther Festspiele. I advise you to buy both versions. They will give you pleasure for a lifetime and you could spend your money a lot worse.
B000FT755Y|5.0|\\"How can these heavenly creatures be real?\\" asks one of the characters in of \\"Heavenly Creatures,\\" the exquisite and horrifying docudrama of a shocking, real-life murder. Famed director Peter Jackson uses spectacular special effects and great actors to show us how these heavenly creatures became monsters.<br /><br />In 1952, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a loner at her proper New Zealand school, until the day Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) arrives -- an intelligent, witty, daring girl who appeals to Pauline. Soon the two of them are nearly inseparable; even Juliet's four month stint in the hospital doesn't separate the girls through their letters and shared fantasies.<br /><br />But soon their parents becomes concerned that their close friendship is \\"unhealthy.\\" It is, just not in the way he thinks. The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense: they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality. Now Juliet is being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together... such as murder.<br /><br />Peter Jackson starts the movie by emphasizing what a beautiful, peaceful country (via a cheesy 1950s documentary) New Zealand is. But beauty is not everything -- fairy tales can become nightmares. Jackson doesn't just show the audience what the two girls did, but showed why they did it. Even then, he doesn't make excuses.<br /><br />At first the movie seems almost whimsical, with fairy tale figures coming to life, beautiful woodlands, and hillsides transforming into blooming gardens. Nobody except Peter Jackson could have pulled off the idea of including living clay figurines or four-foot-wide butterflies. Somehow it not only works, but adds to the surreality of the story.<br /><br />But as the girls go deeper into infatuated madness, Jackson warps the whimsical world around them. Settings get darker and more distorted, and the line between fantasy and reality is completely wiped out.

B000B2YR8I|5.0|Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.<br /><br />But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive,\\" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.<br /><br />Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).<br /><br />Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.<br /><br />\\"Shaun\\" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (\\"Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet...\\")<br /><br />Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.<br /><br />Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.<br /><br />As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? \\"Stone Roses?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"...Second Coming?\\" \\"I liked it.\\" \\"Dire Straits?\\" \\"Chuck it!\\" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.<br /><br />While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy. By not taking itself too seriously, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" ends up revitalizing a genre that seemed like it was... well, almost dead.in a tank.

1593083661|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

B000001DYA|5.0|Originally released in 1968, as this was the band's very first lp. Still cannot believe this was my first time I've ever heard this album. Well, at least that I can remember. I've heard only a couple of Blue Cheer live / compilation releases, until now. I can honestly see WHY old school rockers consider this title to be a true American hard rock classic. Most rocking tunes here are their sole (at least here in the states) hit, Eddy Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues\\", \\"Doctor Please\\", \\"Out Of Focus\\" and the should've-been-a-hit \\"Second Time Around\\". Just six tracks, with a duration of 31:54. By today's standards, this would have been an EP. How things have changed. Well, maybe not everything. 'Vincebus Eruptum' still packs quite a punch. Vintage heavy blues  /psych. A must have. Should appeal to fans of Amboy Dukes, MC 5, Vanilla Fudge and Iron Butterfly.
B00005JOQS|3.0|Spoiler Alert <br /> <br />It's unfortunate.  Everything was there.  The original Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larson) and Lois Lane (Noel Neill) from the 1950's series had cameos.  John Williams' music opened with familiar credits.  Perry White even slipped in the ever famous line, \\"Great Ceasar's ghost\\".  Routh is Superman, and an equally capable, yet clumsy, Clark.  Even Marlon Brando returned from the grave to offer some of the most touching words in the entire film, although Bryan Singer even managed to make Jor-El appear inept. <br /> <br />Then Bryan Singer killed Superman.  The massive, costumed, man of steel lay helpless as he was brutally kicked and stabbed multiple times before falling helplessly to his inevitible death.  He rises again, only to be finally and utterly pounded into the dirt of Metropolis.  I'm not sure whether the villian who drained the life and the idolization of Superman as a hero was Lex Luthor or Bryan Singer.  We spent what felt like hours watching Superman tortured.  We heard people in the audience sniffling.  We then saw a 30-second clip of Lex meeting his \\"punishment\\", stranded on a small island.  Small satisfaction, indeed. <br /> <br />I couldn't figure out how I could go to a movie I'd waited 20 years to see with such anticipation and come out depressed.  Evidently heroes of modern times don't always win, they don't get the girl, they are alone, and the greatest hope in life is simply to survive for yet another day.  The scene that captured the soul of the film involved a crowd, little boys staring into the sky as they watched Superman fall, unconscious, from the cloud, down behind the trees, and then they heard a hollow thud in the distance followed by silence.  Why did Mr. Singer show those boys' sad, hopeful eyes?  Perhaps only to reflect the realistic hopelessness of our times.  From that moment in the movie, there was no real emotional rebound.  No time for cheers or even the inner smile like the one we had when Christopher Reeves' Superman floated down from the dark carrying Lex Luthor and sidekick down into the brightly lit prison where he belonged.   <br /> <br />Lois Lane, who actually had less of an endearing personality than her new boyfriend, was not a girl anyone would want.  While remaining faithful to so much of the original films and 1950s series, the notable exception was Lois.  Nothing of the former Lois' personality remained.  Why, she even spent 15 minutes being slammed around a plane without a mark to show for it.  Proof that the new Lois is truly plastic.  Lex Luthor's girlfriend showed more emotion that Lois. <br /> <br />We go to movies for hopeful fiction, to see the bad guy lose and the good guy win.  That's why we have superheroes.
B0009K7RES|5.0|The CD is one that everyone who loved \\"Shangrila\\" will love. My only complaint is that the CD skips. Not sure if this is someone getting rid of second rate pressings or whatever, but I've never had a CD that is brand new skip out of the case. <br />
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect,with so many artists in one set.The result is one fine artistic achievement covering just about every style of music you could wish to hear, from reggae,to latin beats, hip hop,rock,punk,funk,folk, pop, you name it.Too many highlights to mention,also that will depend on individual musical tastes.However I'll mention a few of the best and the worst......U2 kicks things off into full gear with a great 3 song set.Coldplay slows things down a bit but picks it back up inviting british singer and former Verve vocalist and great songwriter Richard Ashcroft with a soaring version of \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\".Elton John starts off strong but unfortunately makes the mistake of choosing Pete Doherty as a singing partner,Doherty clearly proves that he can neither carry a note or remember the words to the song he is singing, forcing Elton to signal  to his guitarist to end the song prematuraly.The best performance of this set is probably Madonna who knows how to work a crowd and keep the momentum going.Robbie Williams comes pretty close to Madonna in working the crowd,he obviously loves to perform and seems to feel perfectly at home onstage.Linkin Park,Snoop Dog do great versions of their songs on this set,some of the biggest disapointments surprisingly are from some of the biggest names listed, Paul McCartney's set while not bad ,is predictable,Pink Floyd's Roger Waters and David Gilmour seem to loathe each other.The Who sound awesome except for one thing,it's not The Who.It is however a great piece of musical history in one package,I do recomend it to every music lover...enjoy!
0553801503|2.0|Just finished, and all I can say is, Why?  Why was it so necessary to split the original book in two?-- Wouldn't a good bit of editing have served to condense things?  Martin is a brilliant writer-- all the characters have texture and edges, and each has unique qualities. I find I like parts of them and dislike parts. But are they all necessary?   I found myself skimming over the heraldries (\\"bob was the [...] of joe, a landless lord whose family were distant cousins of house jehosephat....\\"), and searching for those few bits that advanced the plot.     I had not realized there were six books planned-- I only hope that Mr. Martin (or his editor) can get his verbal diarrhea under control before six turns into 12 or more.

B000000W6F|5.0|Gish in my opinion is by far the best album The Smashing Pumpkins have put out. Using the heavy Underground/Alternative rock sound they make an album that gets your attention, but at the same time using lots of catchy melodies, and well thought out chord changes, The Pumpkins create there own sound that doesn't seem to get overwhelming, boring, and annoying, Like many of the other bands of the nineties. The Overall talent and creativity of all the members seems to fit together and it all just seems to flow smoothly. Even during the lighter three song break of \\"Crush\\", \\"Suffer\\", and \\"Snail\\" the Pumpkins still keep the music interesting and incredibly enjoyable to listen to. A couple things that really stand out to me (not only in this album but throughout the pumpkins entire music career) is the heavy but flawless and smooth flowing drumming of Jimmy Chamberlin. No matter what Billy and the rest of the band comes up with he is always on top of his drumming, always seeming to come up with something for everything. Then there's Billy Corgan's unique and recognizable voice, which he uses to sing his amazing lyrics. And that just adds to everything else to make the whole thing a masterpiece in my opinion. Gish has been one of my favorite albums for a long time now and will continue to be a favorite for ever.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I have a bone to pick with some of these people who say Alanis has lost her talent or her place in the music scene. Sure she is not as angry as she used to be, but so what. The Collection spans over a decade over her most popular (and not so popular) music during her career. I am a dedicated Alanis fan so I kne I had to get it. <br /> <br />Many people knock her for losing her edge, sure she's not angry but she's got the best voice in music in my opinion. On the album she does a cover of Seal's Crazy. Her vocal surpass his by far, and it sounds like a whole new song. There are also her best know hits such as You Oughta Know and Hand in my Pocket. But if you listen and respect her for who she is you will appreciate her not so well know hits and songs like the major underappreciated song Everything.  <br /> <br />There are a few tracks that take my breath away such as Let's Do it (Let's fall in Love) that track just shows she can do a song and make her own. This cd is  must for the true Alanis fans. If you are just a mediocre fan or just like her for her anger than stay away. It's just a shame you can't appreciate an artist for their talent. GO ALANIS!!!
B000EQH2QK|5.0|This is a must-have for any Shakira fan. \\"Costume Makes the Clown\\" and the politically-charged \\"Timor\\" are some of the shining moments on this album, along with \\"Illegal\\" and \\"The Day and the Time.\\" \\"Something\\"'s haunting melody and chorus make it a great love song. Shakira touches a lot of her familiar themes in new ways, and although in some respects it diverges from the styles of her other albums, the new directions she goes in work well. And of course, \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" is a great dance hit, even if it's a little lyrically light. (I must say that I think that dedicated fans were screwed over royally, since those of us who rushed out to buy it the second the album came out found ourselves just buying it again later when the dualdisc and then the \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" versions came out months later - just another way the record companies are out to screw fans). But other than that, the album is a shining success.

B00005JP4U|5.0|Al Gore won't win an Academy Award, but this documentary based on his slideshow about global warming will.  For what this documentary does is what film does best: it takes a difficult topic--that has years of accumulated misunderstandings both real and created, both about global warming and Gore himself--and it lays the issue out cleanly, understandably, and, most importantly these days, in an entertaining fashion.  This is how the best scientific presentations should be done, with humor, with facts, and with a call for action.  Gore may have lost the presidency (the early joke in the movie is when he introduces himself as \\"the former future President of the United States\\"), but he has gained a calling, and that may have been the best thing for our world.<br /><br />There's nothing about the science presented in _An Inconvenient Truth_ that is new.  Even those things that Gore presents to his on-screen audience as \\"an image that not many people have seen before,\\" have now been seen by quite a number of people (including the increasing number of people seeing this movie).  What makes this movie, and Gore's presentation, so effective is that he puts it all together, in a coherent story, that effectively showcases each puzzle piece in both time and importance.  The seeds of doubt that have been so effectively manipulated by those who do not wish to deal with global warming grow in the thin soil of radio talk shows and late night soundbites.  Given an hour-and-a-half, Gore's argument and his passion for his subject overcome those limitations, answering both his critics and the critics of global warming.<br /><br />For this documentary is about Al Gore as much as it is about the inconvenient truth of the title, for Gore provides the human side of this scientific equation, standing in for every American who has to understand how much of an inconvenience this is.  He connects it to an early accident involving his son, that helped him step back from his life and examine what he considered important.  He connects to his family's legacy as Tennessee tobacco farmers, who knew about the dangers of tobacco, yet continued to grow it until smoking caused the death of his sister, forcing them to evaluate their choice.  And he connects it to the last five years, by revealing global warming as a threat that is as important, if not more so, than global terrorism.<br /><br />Moreover, rather than simply being the Chicken Little that he and his global warming scientist friends are portrayed to be, Gore shows that, while the sky may indeed be falling, it's not the end of the world.  The warning signs are there, but it is not irreversable.  There are things that we can do.  And this is where the inconvenience of the title comes through the clearest because the choices we make to reverse global warming are not convenient.  As he states in his presentation, \\"It is amazing to me how so many people go straight from denial to despair,\\" referring to how so many people, once confronted with the reality of how humans have affected a global system proceed to throw up their hands and say that nothing can be done.  Gore's call-to-arms is in stark contrast to his former opponent's own call-to-arms in his war: Bush, on the verge of the \\"war against terrorism,\\" when asked what the country could do, encouraged people to go spend, so as to keep our economy strong.  Gore admits that in fighting global warming, the actions will be more difficult, but he compares this to the great battles of our past: the American Revolution and its hardships, the great cost of the Civil War, and the rationing and victory gardens of World War II.  When faced with a great challenge, Gore says, Americans have come together and overcome it by their collective action before, and they can again.  And, in the case of global warming, he shows that it is our moral imperative as citizens of the country that is contributing the most to this problem, not to mention our ethical response as humancitizens of the world.<br /><br />I'm sure that Sunday morning will be filled with pundits blathering on about \\"Gore's crusade\\" and environmental extremism, as will the nattering nabobs of negativism on the radio.  Rather than making your decision based upon their opinions--for you have no idea where their real motivations lie--I urge you, instead, to go see Mr. Gore's movie, to spend just 90 minutes on a subject that has real consequences for all of us.  Freed of his political aspirations and provided with another six years of hard data that matches the scientific model forecasts, Gore is able to speak with mounting passion about global warming in such a way that reveals to everyone his emotional core.  That is why this movie will win an Oscar, and--I hope--will help people come to grips with this very inconvenient truth.human citizens of the world. <br /> <br />I'm sure that Sunday morning will be filled with pundits blathering on about \\"Gore's crusade\\" and environmental extremism, as will the nattering nabobs of negativism on the radio.

1881273156|5.0|Married couples and single people, who are thinking about marriage, must read this book.  I believe most of us have had the \\"in love\\" experience and after marriage we have come down back to earth and found out that for some strange reason, unknown to us, love has somehow vanished.  The author, Gary Chapman, beautifully and understandably wrote this book.  What he mentioned in this book about the languages of love is very eye-opening and as the reader will notice, it is something we are, or has been, familiar with but did not recognize in the past.  About all, if not all, that the author wrote in this book made sense to us; to love is an action, not necessarily a feeling.  A long-lasting commitment to love one another within any healthy relationship is no light matter and will take some effort from the lives involved of said relationships.  I highly recommend this book.  Read it, meditate on it, and put to practice what you will learn.
B000003TA4|2.0|I bought Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" over two years ago, after hearing years of hype about how this is one of the greatest albums ever made.  I've tried to listen to this disc off and on for two years, and I just do not get it.   <br /> <br />Nevermind opens up well with three good songs in Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, and Come as you are.  I pretty much disliked everything after those.  I do not see what is so special about their playing, calling Dave Grohl the greatest drummer of all time is crazy, and Kurt being considered a great guitarist is absolutely mind blowing.  He is not a good singer either. <br /> <br />Brilliant song writing?  Since when is typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus-repeat song structures and barely average lyrics considered brilliant writing?  None of these songs are unique at all in terms of structure and Cobain's lyrics are pretty amateur in my opinion. <br /> <br />Besides all the hype, this is still a pretty decent album.  To call this album \\"perfection\\", is insane in my opinion, and it discredits what many talented musicians did before these guys.

B0009AM5I6|5.0|The only other DVD of the opera that I'm familiar with is [[ASIN:0783227477 Zeffirelli's movie version]], which relies on cinematic effects as much as on the (heavily cut) score. There are no cinematic effects in this Solti version, but neither is it a \\"live\\" production -- clearly, it was taped without an audience and then shots of the Covent Garden crowd were spliced in. That's probably just as well, as we get a minimum of interruptions for applause, but be warned if you are expecting a truly spontaneous performance.    I can only echo what has already been said about Georghiu's performance. Unlike the vulnerable, barely-in-control Violetta of Teresa Stratas, she is a queen, commanding every scene she's in (which is most of them). She moves with graceful deliberation and sings with absolute authority. Lopardo is less persuasive as Alfredo -- maybe it's just that he squints too much to convince us that he's the ardent lover -- but the excellent overall direction masks any lack of acting skills. Indeed every bit of stage action in this performance seamlessly advances the story -- there is no sense, as there often is in opera, that the performers are being busy just for the sake of being busy.    It's a pleasure to be able to say that all this technical proficiency does not diminish the emotional impact of the production. Maybe it doesn't quite get the three-hankie rating of Zeffirelli's version, but it certainly gets two, and it perhaps earns them a little more honestly.

B000001FDQ|5.0|I remember being in high school in the mid-80's and hearing the tale of this Yngwie Malmsteen character from all my musician buddies.  Yngwie Malmsteen?  What the hell kinda name is that?  Who's this punk from Sweden think he is?  I heard the Steeler stuff with Ron Keel and wasn't that impressed.  The Alcatrazz stuff was better but Graham Bonnet got on my nerves.  Then, out of nowhere, comes Rising Force....  Jesus H. Christ!  This little punk from Sweden with the attitude from hell and the fingers forged of lightning really turned some heads, including mine.  After snagging Uli Jon Roth licks in Alcatrazz, Yngwie settles down on his own and created one of the most important neo-classical shredder albums of all time.  Just listening to it every now and again still fills me with awe.  Since most of Rising Force is instrumental, Yngwie never caught on with the chick crowd and therefore never attained Rock God stature.  He was more of a mucisian's musician.  The two songs that bear lyrics are \\"As Above, So Below\\" & \\"Now Your Ships Are Burned\\" giving us a glimpse of the coolness that was Jeff Scot Soto on lead vocals.  Yngwie's lyrics aren't exactly the best, and they continue into the cheesy all the way into Trilogy, but these are still two of my favorite songs by Yngwie.  As far as the rest of the album is concerned, where the instrumentals dominate, there is \\"Black Star\\" as the quintessential Yngwie staple.  \\"Far Beyond The Sun\\" rocks in so many ways that it makes your head reel and the intensity of \\"Icarus Dream Suite Op. 4\\" with Yngwie trading licks with keyboardist Jens Johansen is insane.  \\"Evil Eye\\" is very cool and one of the first songs I ever learned on guitar.  \\"Little Savage\\" is mostly Yngwie showing off his speed to a pounding, semi-monotonous beat.  And \\"Farewell\\" is just a little lesson in harmonics.  Overall, you wanna hear a pioneer in the guitar shredding community.  Yngwie J. Malmsteen's Rising Force is the album to buy.  You won't be disappointed.  After listening to him, you'll wind up using your guitar as a coffee table, as Spinal Tap's David St. Hubbins once said of The Ynger.<br /><br />Dig it!After listening to him, you'll wind up using your guitar as a coffee table, as Spinal Tap's David St. Hubbins once said of The Ynger.

B00005JP0A|5.0|I love movies with great acting and this movie has great acting.  I hadn't read the book but i heard that the ending is different.  The ending that was picked for this film has a great moral lesson.  I'm sure when your at the top of any back-stabbing company, you must be extremely lonely but the character of Meryl Streep puts awhole new meaning to the works \\"lonely\\" and \\"mean.\\"  The film is funny, whitty, fast moving with increadible costumes.  It would be like watching a Dois Day movie today.  Just beautifully filmed and executed.  I look forward to this on DVD.  Enjoy, you will get your money's worth.

1592401791|5.0|As someone who has read nearly 30 books on that little bar band from Liverpool, it was difficult for me to believe a new book could offer anything, well, new. This one, however, might be the best one yet.  <br />I consider it the most objective, offering more insight into the inner workings of the group than anything else published. Sorry if you don't like his depictions of individual members. The general tone of the book and the fact he points out positive and negative qualities of all of them should make it clear he had no axes to grind.  <br />All of the members turned out to be likeable people after they escaped the insanity of their Beatle lives, so it's easy to forget now that they weren't always regarded so highly by people who knew them when. I doubt anyone who's studied the group closely would find many points to argue.  <br />Strange that it was left to a recording engineer to offer such a detailed, objective account. But then it was going to have to come from an insider and there were so few of those. Fortunately Emerick was able and willing to rise to the challenge.  <br />

B00005JNNZ|3.0|Coach Carter is a fairly good film about one man's efforts to coach a group of high school kids and show them that there is more to life than playing basketball. This movie is based on the true story of Coach Ken Carter, an unconventional coach who made headline news in the state of California when he suspended the basketball season indefinitely until his players agreed to devote more time to their studies and comply with a contract each player signed with him at the start of the season.<br /><br />This movie offers a strong message and this is among its most important aspects. The message in this film is simple and it basically centers on the importance of self- discipline and education. Carter was once a player himself at the same high school and he grew to understand the importance of success off the court. Basketball is a fun sport and it can provide a means for development of teamwork concepts; physical fitness; and overall discipline. But Carter knew that success at basketball is limited. Playing college ball is possible but the likelihood that a player will succeed all the way to the NBA is unlikely. Therefore, it is important to never forget the importance of academics. Success in school will provide a back- up plan if success in basketball doesn't reach the professional level. Samuel Jackson's character preaches this fact over and over to his players and while they don't necessarily grasp his wisdom at first, they gradually mature and realize the importance of what their coach is trying to say.<br /><br />Most of this movie centers on Coach Carter and his interaction with the players and their parents but there are a couple of subplots in the background. One subplot involves the coaches own son, Damien Carter (played by Robert Ri'Chard). At the beginning of the movie, Damien is shown attending a private school- an institution that his father enrolled him because he felt it would provide his son with the greatest chance for academic success. Damien, however, decides he would rather be at Richmond with his dad so he quits the school under the strict conditions of his father and joins the Richmond basketball team. In another subplot, one of the players has some personal issues to work out with his girlfriend who is now pregnant. These subplots offer a break from the rest of the movie but they don't add much to its overall value.<br /><br />I like Samuel Jackson's performance as the hard- nosed head coach but most of the other performances in this movie are only average. Several of the actors in this movie who portray different basketball players (like Robert R'Chard, Channing Tatum, and Antown Tanner) got their start on television and have limited experience on the big screen. They seem to be adequate in their roles but none of them is very memorable and none of the characters stand out in the crowd. They get the job done, but with few signs of any exceptional talent.<br /><br />By far the greatest criticism I have for Coach Carter is with its script. The dialogue throughout the movie is weak and I started to wonder what was going on in the minds of the film's writers when they composed this script. The dialogue is forgettable and there are no memorable quotes at all. Even Samuel Jackson, who does a great deal of sermonizing in this movie, can't come up with any memorable statements. And the players make clich&eacute;- ridden statements typical of what one would expect from unmotivated inner city youth. That is to say, their comments are mostly forgettable.<br /><br />The DVD of Coach Carter includes a few extras like deleted scenes and a music video but the best among them is a feature on Coach Ken Carter and some of the actual players whom this movie is based on. Carter talks about his tenure as coach, his relationships with the players, and his feelings about basketball and academics. There are also some words from the players with each of them explaining what it was like to play for a guy like Ken Carter and how hisinfluence has affected their lives both on and off the court.<br /><br />With the flaws in the subplots and dialogue, Coach Carter loses a few points with me but I still think it has enough good qualities to give it a slight recommendation. It moves at a good clip and the basketball game scenes are well- made and entertaining. The script was weak and the subplots useless but there is no denying the importance of the main message of the movie: That there is more to life than sports and everyone needs to strive to be the best in the classroom in order to have the best chance for success. Self- discipline and respect are important qualities for all, and their implementation will go a long way toward fulfillment in life.influence has affected their lives both on and off the court.<br /><br />With the flaws in the subplots and dialogue, Coach Carter loses a few points with me but I still think it has enough good qualities to give it a slight recommendation.

B000089770|3.0|I love this movie.  Yes, it is a bit off-beat, but I think that just makes it all the more fun.  The cast is one of those rare combinations of individuals who seem to bring out the best in one another, like a good rock band.  As with any great film, it is a story well told.  It's a feel-good movie that avoids being sentimental, or overly simple.  The characters are believable and the story is entertaining.<br /><br />So, why three stars for a great movie?  Because, at one time, it was even greater.  When first released to theaters and then to VHS, it was a different film.  It began with a Jerry Garcia video that just set the tone for what was to come.  I also remember more cameos in the film.  So, it was better, it got butchered, but it's far from dead.

B000E33VWW|5.0|First of all, I am a fan of Philip Seymore Hoffman.  I have long hoped to see more of him and in more challenging roles.  This is some of the best acting on film.  The story is told so brilliantly that it is worthy of its' subject, the immortal author of \\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" and \\"In Cold Blood,\\" which is the period of his life the film focuses on.  Like a great novel, this film breathes - it does not do our thinking for us and it does not need to tell us how to feel at any point.  Like a well written novel, it assumes the reader (or, viewer) can think.  It is full of subtlety.   <br /> <br />Hoffman is Capote.  Capote was one of those rare, charismatic individuals that could captivate a room full of people just by entering.  He could hold them captive with his tales and antics for hours.  He knew how to reach people.  He treated everyone as an individual and learned each person's personal language.  For some, that language may be shared experience, an expression of empathy or sympathy and for others it might be so simple and crude as money.  He was a strange, amazing little man and Hoffman succeeded at raising him from the grave. <br /> <br />I hope to see more Hoffman after this, and in roles that are worthy of his sublime genius.  The \\"shart\\" thing (\\"What About Mary?) was funny, but so beneath a person of this stellar ability.

B0002W18MU|4.0|It's always a touchy subject when releasing unfinished music posthumously. On one hand, you have the desire of fans to get their hands on everything an artist recorded, but on the other, you are hearing the music not necessarily the way an artist wanted you to hear it. But there is a sense of relief that the latest Johnny Cash album, American V: A Hundred Highways that Rick Rubin is at the helm just like the previous four American recording that have been recorded over the past decade. Notice I said latest, not last album as Rubin is currently working on more songs from the sessions for at least another album. <br /> <br />Much of this album was recorded in-between the five months between the death of his wife June and his own and the melancholy throughout the album starting with the album opener Help Me. If You Could Read My Mind is touching considering the context and even though the song isn't about death and originally done by Gordon Lightfoot, you can't but think he's singing to June. As his voice starts to break at the end of song, so will your heart. But it's not all heartache and loss as he later sings Love's Been Good to Me. <br /> <br />The last song that Johnny Cash ever wrote and recorded is on this set too. Like the 309 is a bouncy song that is reminiscent of him as a young man hanging out at a train station. Oddly enough the song starts off with the line, \\"It should be awhile before I see Dr. Death.\\" As Cash recorded much of these tunes confined to a wheelchair and nearly blind, his own mortality is touched upon elsewhere on the album most notable on the Bruce Springsteen cover Further up On the Road (which was part of the 9/11 inpired The Rising album). The album closes with a rerecording of his 1962 song, I'm Free from the Chain Gang now which takes a whole new meaning after his death and now he's free after spending his life being the voice of the voiceless and downtrodden. <br /> <br />If there is a downside to American V it would actually have tobe Rubin. After single handedly resurrecting Cash's career by pushing him to places he hasn't been before musically, this album is pretty safe and sound like an album Cash would have made had he never met Rubin. The only song here that would fit on the earlier American recording is traditional gospel song God's Gonna Cut You Down where a chorus of hand claps and foot stomps surrounds Cash's vocals and sounds like a death march. But it's not for Cash, instead it's for the, \\"rambler, gambler, the backbiter\\" and all other sinners in the world. The rest of the album though sounds almost as if Rubin wanted to take the safe route in creating the music behind Cash's previously recorded vocals as to not taint Cash's legacy in turn making them afterthoughts in the Cash musical vault. But with that said, Johnny Cash afterthoughts are still better than ninety-five percent of the music made today.

0800141660|4.0|From what I've gathered, this is one of the most popular out of all Jane Austen adaptations, right up there with P&P95. And yet, while I do think it's a good movie, it's not my favorite S&S, for reasons I will go into in this review. I have several problems with it, including much of the casting and some of the writing as well. Really my feelings towards this and P&P95 are quite similar, but at least this movie doesn't have any of the \\"sexed up\\" content Andrew Davies put in P&P. Why do I have so many problems with both of these versions? Is it just because I think they're overrated and I have a tendency to root for the underdog blindly? Well, no. But that is admittedly a small part of it. Rather, I already found flaws in each adaptation but these were magnified after constantly hearing people say how \\"perfect\\" they are. I'm really not trying to offend any fans of this movie. I AM a fan of this movie, own it on DVD, and have watched it multiple times. I just think it's not as good as many fans seem to think it is. And any time I hear \\"definitive\\" about any adaptation (even my absolute favorites), it drives me up the wall!<br /><br />The casting is my biggest problem with this movie. Most of the actors are frankly, way too old for their roles. Okay, maybe if EVERY character were aged up it would make sense. But they're not and that just adds to the problem. Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman are all MUCH older than their characters, yet Kate Winslet is nearly the same age as the book's Marianne.
1572814349|5.0|I became interested in these cards because I bookmarked the authors web site and I really enjoy her site. The cards and book come in a nice box, making it convenient for travel and display. I appreciate the explainations of how the cards came to be and the differences from her original set compared to this one, on her website. The cards are a little larger than I am used to when it comes to handling them. I'm thinking with more use they will get easier to shuffle. I like the backs and golden edge. I have another deck that I am more intuitive with for my personal readings, but I think these are nice for readings in general, be it for myself or someone else, because I don't use my personal deck for other people. I think the pictures are neutral enough that readings for others would not be intimidating, (some people interpret Tarot in fearful way even when they are fascinated by it). Over all, I look forward to working with this deck and becoming more in tune with it, and I would recommend anyone interested to use the website as well as the books, it's quite lovely.
6305907145|2.0|The original story of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen is nowhere to be found here. Patricia Rozema ripped it to shreds. I do not say this because I am a purist. I'm NOT! I know changes are necessary for movie adaptations of books but this went too far, changing the entire tone of the novel. It's disappointing because most of the cast was great (Frances O'Connor was a little iffy for me as Fanny but the Fanny in this movie bears no resemblance to the book one so it doesn't matter, I guess). Why did Rozema feel the need to make pretty much the whole focus of the movie on slavery? There is a minor mention of it in the novel but she blows it out of proportion here. I know how many people don't like Fanny Price, including Rozema, apparently, because she makes the character unrecognizable. Fanny here is a cross between Jane Austen (writing, and doing something Jane Austen did but book Fanny would NEVER do) and Lizzy Bennet (outspoken, strong, confident, etc.) Why did Rozema pick this story to film? Couldn't she have made an original movie instead?<br /><br />A lot of people say they like it even though it is so different from the novel, but I can't do the same. They made some really questionable stylistic choices- odd, awkward camera angles that made me dizzy; stupid, cheesy slow-motion horse-back riding, etc.

It goes more deeply into concepts only touched upon in the Power of Now, and it also explains how to align one's outer purpose (life goals, career, etc.) with one's inner spiritual purpose.  It also touches upon the outer purpose of the universe and grand meaning behind all that is.  It's very enlightening.
6304712499|2.0|Spawn was one of those movies (and there are many), that was so caught up in the special effects department that the plot and characters were thrown to the waste side.  In my opinion, it should have focused more on \\"Damn, Al Simmons is one tortured soul\\", as opposed to \\"Wow, that's a cool cape, what's this movie about again?\\"<br />Usually when one points out the pros and cons of a movie, the pros come first, but since I only have two, it leaves the cons to start it off.  Here we go.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. To say the movie was miscast is an understatement (Terry, nuff said)<br />2. Too much camp, not enough darkness.  If it's going to be R rated (DVD), then make it that way.  I've seen more violence in one episode of Smallville.<br />3. The plot was just a highlight reel of Spawns abilities.  \\"Hey, look, I can block a crotch kick with my belt buckle\\".<br />4. Waaaay too much exposition and not enough follow through.  The plot was too simple and there was no mystery to it.  Watching this movie was like cutting out all the 007 villain \\"This is my plan for taking over the world\\" scenes and putting them all together.<br />5. What was the point of the homeless kid subplot?  It made no sense.<br />6. The atmosphere and lighting wasn't dark enough.  Spawns makeup, because it was so illuminated, made his skin look like rubber.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. John Leguizamo was outstanding as the clown.<br />2. The special effects where done very well.<br /><br />Well, that's it folks.  Anyone reading this is probably wondering why someone who dislikes a movie so much would take the time to write so much about it?  Because I love trashing moves almost as much as praising them.  After following the HBO animated series (I didn't follow the comic, never have been a big comic collector), I was so disappointed when the movie went 180 degree's in the other direction, favoring a mass audience with a PG-13 rating.  If you don't have the money to produce a quality flick, don't do it.  Maybe one day Spawn will be made into a real movie.
B00005JP4U|5.0|I think alot of people have either forgotten or put to the back of their minds the issues with global warming.  The fact is unless we do something soon most of us will be underwater.  The film is scary, but very real.  This isn't a hoax, or something that can be put off any longer.  You must see this film, it will answer any question you've ever had on the subject and then some.  I live in Alaska, and I can tell you this is ABSOLUTELY for real, this is happening people.  Wake up and lets do something about it, 'cause our beloved(not) president sure isn't.  I know there are some of you out there saying \\"Oh, the planet will reset itself, we can't do anything, it's what god intended\\".  All that may be true, but you're all a bunch of lazy cowards for saying so.  Is this a gamble we're really ready to make?  Are you realy that trust worthy of your politicians that've done nothing but lie to you thus far, that you're willing to just sit back and hope they're right?  I'm sure you'll all be saying that same thing when you're watching your family drown.  When you're displaced because your home and everything you've ever known is washed away.  You think ther world is over populated now, how about if there were 30% less land mass in the world, what then?  You sure sound cool saying that now though, so go with it & keep lying to yourself & others, ignorance is bliss I guess.  We're teetering on the end of the world here people, we have evil men in power running amok & unchecked, bullying around the entire world.  These mad men think the pusuit of the last drop of oil so they can line their wallets is more important than anything else; can't you all see that?  They're lying right in our faces & we're just sitting back & taking it.  What's more important than the planet we live on people, we've only got one?  This isn't a political issue, this effects every man, woman, & child on the planet, and leaving it up to the politicians isn't gonna be good enough any more.  We all need to take a stand and stop this while we still can.  Maybe we can't, maybe we're to far gone & won't be able to have any lasting effects, but shouldn't we at least try?  Don't we at least owe that to our beloved mother earth?  After all the holes, craters & spills and everything else we've done here don't we at least owe that?  Shame on all of us for leaving it up to Al Gore to have to make a movie about this before people are willing to give a damn.  Even still most people think it's just some kind of a lame joke.

B00005JOVH|2.0|X Men 3<br /><br />What can I say, the negative reviews were right.  I really wanted to like this movie.  The first and second were excellent.  But much like Blade Trinity, this was a huge let down.  Where to begin?<br /><br />1. The movie was only about an hour and a half long.<br />2. There were too many characters introduced.<br />3. They were all very generic, only there to service the plot  (Multiple man is a perfect example).<br />4. No character development to speak of, even from the returning cast.<br />5. The plot was promising but extremely thin and almost non existent.<br />6. The use (or lack of use, rather) of the Phoenix was embarrassing.<br />7. The action was a bit over the top.<br />8. \\"The Last Stand\\" was very disappointing, if you catch my double meaning.<br /><br />Why bother going any further, I think I made my point.  I just hope Brett \\"Rush Hour\\" Ratner isn't involved in any of the spinoffs.  On a good note, I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD, but only to complete the set.
B00007LTIC|4.0|More like 3.51 stars, so I'm rounding up to 4 . . .<br /><br />This album is one of the brighter spots in their late '70's stint, infinitely preferable to their worst '70's album, _Tormato_.  That being said, it is not exactly a pinnacle in the larger picture of their nigh-unparalleled catalog.  There is simply no comparing this to the unrelenting _Close to the Edge_ and _The Yes Album_.  Despite the fact that _Going for the One_ contains almost all of the \\"classic\\" lineup, and the only one who is not part of the \\"classic\\" lineup--the stellar Alan White on drums--is part of the greater part of Yes's finest moments to begin with, this album does not consistently deliver the goods.  When it does, it does so in a pretty big way.  When it doesn't: oh well, it's not as annoying as anything on _Tormato_.<br /><br />Let's start with the so-so: \\"Turn of the Century\\" is an Anderson-driven vehicle that aims for epic sweep, but largely ends up sounding unnecessary.  It's not that his vocals don't deliver; they always have.  It just sounds like Yes trying to do more of what has made them successful (transcendence, rising, etc. . . . yeah, we certainly get it by 1977).  This wouldn't be a bad thing if the band sounds inspired, but they don't on this song.  They sound like they are going through the epic gestures, if you will, and the result is lackluster.  I put \\"Wonderous Stories\\" on this level, too.  Inspirational?  Beautiful?  Well-executed?  Yes, yes, and yes.  Do I want to play it over and over like other prettier Yes songs, e.g. \\"Soon\\" on _Relayer_?  Definitely not.  One shot of this song in a year does it for me.<br /><br />Okay, now to the better than so-so.  The title track that starts the album definitely has some compelling stuff going on.  I love the raunchy slide guitar that drives the song, making it a little bit country and a little bit prog'n'roll.  I love the theme of going for the one, the distinctive harmonies, and other things besides.  These factors alone make this song infinitely better than anything in the norm of rock.  But, and this is a big \\"but,\\" Yes is so far beyond the norm of rock, that anything dragging the song down from their self-created standard of sheer perfection sticks out in a huge way.  There is more than one thing holding the title track back from Yes nirvana.  The biggest thing: Rick Wakeman succumbs to the seemingly universal urge in prog synth players of the mid-to-late-'70's: he uses annoying synth tones.  While it is not as bad as the Casio-sounding stuff on a great part of _Tormato_, it's a little bit tinny.  I can understand that digital synth created such a larger palette of sounds than analog can dream of, but the sound quality of analog remains superior to this day, for a great part: largely because of its warmth.  He most certainly doesn't choose the right digital setting on the title track.  Other fault: it gets a little too repetitive: after the tenth repetition of Wakeman's main arpeggio figure intermingling with Wakeman's admirable but finite slide figure, you begin to wonder if Yes is just trying to make the song the standard prog ten minutes.  I think this might be the case.<br /><br />This latter fault mars the otherwise noteworthy \\"Parallels,\\" also.  Thankfully, Wakeman centers this one around pipe organ which tends to suit him more than the Casio tones at this point in his development.  But the length becomes an issue.  They should have cut this one by two minutes and boosted the exuberance of the studio performance (oh Eddie Offord, where were you when Yes really needed your cheerleading and brainstorming skills?).  Then it would've been perfect.  Otherwise, it's just a really awesome song with a few flaws, burying it in obscurity in a Yes catalog brimming with an inordinate amount of unconditional rock classics.<br /><br />So where is perfection to be found?  Never worry, it is here.  The version of \\"Awaken\\" on this CD is the best to be found anywhere, and there are several other compelling live versions of this out there that, alas, mar themselves with excessive repetition (their urge to improve their songs by repeating exciting motifs is admirable, but misguided in certain cases).  This studio version has everything you want and need in a Yes song.  Mystery, grandeur, surprising shifts in dynamics, superb harmony, oblique lyrical approach, and on and on.  \\"Awaken\\" to the majesty of this album.  It takes a little wading through a few missed steps by Yes to get to this gem at the end of the album; once you arrive at this point, you have attained absolute bliss along with a band who has strived for it to mixed success up to this point.  The missteps along the way are never severe enough to completely put you off, unlike the (blessed-few) clinkers in their catalog (_Big Generator_, _Tormato_, and a couple others).  The mis-steps are enough to hold them well back of the classics.<br /><br />So I recommend you buy this one, but don't expect it to plant itself on your player for the next few weeks, like _Close to the Edge_ or whatever.  It's an esoteric treat to be brought out every now and then.  Can't spite that.e several other compelling live versions of this out there that, alas, mar themselves with excessive repetition (their urge to improve their songs by repeating exciting motifs is admirable, but misguided in certain cases).

B0002W18MU|5.0|This album is really great. The last album from the series \\"The Man Comes Around\\" was a very good album too. But this album is for real, you can hear it in his voice. Pretty hard to put my finger on it but this album is more directly pointing on something on all the songs. Very soulful and really good.

0060763280|2.0|OKay... I have been reading this book and there are lots of things helpful. <br /> <br />However one thing that bothered me is that he keeps advertising his seminars. In every chapter he relates the subjects he is defending , with what he teaches in his seminars...  <br /> <br />I  personally dont like that..  <br /> <br />Book is written well and really takes the readers attention. <br /> <br />Another thing is if you really want to understand the secrets of the millionares... READ \\"RICH DAD POOR DAD\\"...by Robert Kiyosaki <br /> <br />Harv Eker's gives almost same points as Robert Kiyosaki's book \\"Rich Dad....\\" <br /> <br />So I recommend you to read \\"RICH DAD POOR DAD\\" before reading this. And when it comes to going to his seminars and paying thousands of dollars. Read other investment books of Robert Kiyosaki. I m sure that would be more helpful..!!!!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|I don't want to waste too much of your time, so I am going to give it to you short and sweet. \\"Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang\\" is a crime noir/buddy comedy that is much better than I expected it to be going in. Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. have a great chemistry, and the director Shane Black, guides the movie with tongue firmly in cheek. The entire supporting cast is very good as well. This movie has a little bit of everything and it has undeniable style. If your on the fence about purchasing this one, I ask you to go ahead and take the risk. This is a movie that even if you are a little biased going in, it has a way of bringing you back around on it's side by the end.
0345475674|4.0|Harris approaches his subject from an interesting angle.  The hero is an engineer assigned to care for the water lines, reservoirs, and aqueducts which served Pompeii and a number of other towns in ancient Roman Italy.  The young engineer shows up to take up the position left vacant by the previous, and missing, aquarius.  Attilius is almost immediately saddled with a disaster: the aqueduct fails, and people begin to go thirsty.  He must discover why the aqueduct has failed, what has happened to the previous aquarius and what to do with the daughter of a local former slave who has become the richest man in the area with a cruel streak to match his great wealth.  Attilius must juggle all of this while he begins to realize that the water problems are somehow related to a reawakening of the volcano Vesuvius.  <br /> <br />The book is quick paced, well written, suspenseful, and very enjoyable! <br />
B00005JOQS|3.0|Superman returns after 5 years absence, where in essence he tried to 'find' himself in the remains of Krypton.  He finds the world worse off, Lois engaged to Richard White with a son and Lex Luthor loose upon the world because Superman missed a court date.<br /><br />Brandon Routh does an admiral job of trying to fill the red boots, giving a performance reminscent of Christopher Reeve's. The problem is the world has changed since the original Reeve vehicle was released in 1978.  Superman has changed in some formats, for instance Lois and Clark and Smallville.  Routh's version has not changed. He is still the boyscout from the stars.<br /><br />The effects are amazing, and the flight scenes are breath taking.  Kevin Spacey turns in an admirable but not all that original performance as Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's direction, is as always with him, amazing, concentrating on the people and characters and not the stunts and effects.<br /><br />The problem in the direction lies in the fact Superman does not have a true dark side, even his emotional struggles seem to me to be surface only. Singer needs that darkness to tell his tales properly.  It is sad to say that X3 suffered on account of this.<br /><br />Also the \\"surprise\\" twist is clear the first time the character around which is revolves is introduced. And Superman's reaction to it, while sweet does not make sense. He is the uber alpha male and his reaction to his discovery is the opposite of what it should be.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Brandon Routh is a dead ringer for Reeve - at least vocally and at a distance.  Note: the Blue Contacts aren't fooling anyone<br /><br />2. Kate Bosworth - a modern Lois with real world reactions<br /><br />3. James Marsden - nice to see his eyes<br /><br />4. Stunts and effects.  Flight scenes are graceful, gentle and awe inspiring.<br /><br />5. the Mention of Gotham, as if there is a possibility of the bat making a cameo in the next film, which I have no doubt will happen.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. the \\"surprise\\" twist is so telegraphed I wanted to scream<br /><br />2. Most every 'twist' or action is telegraphed so far ahead, there are no surprises, no 'wow' factor<br /><br />Technically, it was an excellent film, with beauty and grace, excellent performances and good direction.

I like the beautiful women - Janet Leigh, Debra Paget in this also.I'm just crazy about Knights, Castles, Vikings and the whole Medevil period. Also, the music score by Franz Waxman is extremely good.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|A very solid debut album that, at its best, reminds me of Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade, and some of the more mellow songs of Modest Mouse.  However, Band of Horses, is not at its best for the entire album.  I found the first half of the album entrancing with it use of catchy guitar riffs and clever lyrics.  The second half of the album is a letdown.  All the energy that they infuse the album with in the first half is lost to droopy acoustic guitar playing and boring songs.  Don't get me wrong, I would recommend the album but it is not without its flaws.   <br /> <br />\\"Our Swords\\" is probably my favorite song from the album and it best captures the Modest Mouse/Arcade Fire-esque sounding song from beginning to end but any of the first five songs from this album are worth listening to.  For a debut album, it is really accessible and gives me hope that this band with have a bright future.   <br />
0060899190|5.0|I'm an educational leader in the New York City public school system.  This book is full of potential for development of our young people.  Recently this work inspired a project in our school where students made their own PostSecrets and displayed them in their common area.  These were powerful, multi-disciplinary works that attracted the attention of the community.  They became the catalysts for various forums of discourse, discussion and debate throughout the school on many of the social and educational issues that the works surfaced.  The school leadership was able to get a powerful sense of the tone of the community culture and climate.   <br /> <br />Since the school has a powerful practice of Advisory - where all students are known well by at least one adult professional - (they are actually known quite well by many...but Advisory is a powerful essential element) teachers in Advisory were able to design goal oriented and objective supported projects that deepened the understandings, knowledge and skills of students to increase their own mindfulness of self, awareness of others and a sense of tolerance, acceptance and, dare I say it, compassion for others. <br /> <br />Also, most importantly, some of the students felt safe enough to express deeper feelings of alienation, lonliness, early confrontations with racism and bigotry as well as a general sense of disillusionment with the whole notion of \\"democracy\\" \\"family\\" and \\"relationships of love, trust and confidence\\" that often are the \\"pink elephants\\"...not only in our classrooms...but in the homes and communities of our students...not to mention the higher offices of government and public education administrations.   <br /> <br />This makes it possible for educators and educational leaders who truly care about improving the fortunes and circumstances of their students' lives to frame the kinds of questions that might help students face the incredible dilemmas of becomming an American citizen...or, should I say,a World citizen...in these very confusing times.   <br /> <br />Thank you to the creator of this work - and to the many individuals who supported this fellow's idea - by participating in his project.  It would not have happened unless others had chosen to take the time to send him their work.  It is a wonderful example of project-based group work that requires collaboration and authentic contribution.   <br /> <br /> <br />BRAVO to Frank Warren for helping us to appreciate the incredible mystery, beauty and power of our ordinary, imperfect lives.
B00001U0DP|1.0|Saw this one on television. Scenery and costuming are pretty good. But overall I really don't care for it. There really is nothing funning about the Holocost. Indeed the scene best showing this is when the child of the main character is briefly lead away by an Aufseherin. She is wearing a starched clean white nanny apron over her uniform complete with black boots, her face devoid of warmth; which pretty much describes the reality of this film.
B00005U122|4.0|If Roger Waters has made one mistake since his departure from Pink Floyd, besides going to blows with Gilmour, at least verbally, it is how he's forgotten about Radio K.A.O.S. This, I've always thought, was his most unique, interesting, and best sounding album since his Pink Floyd Days. And for someone touring solo, certainly he could fit in one song from this album.  <br /> <br />Other then that, though, I really enjoyed this DVD. The Wall stuff on this video was great, he played a really rocking version of \\"Set your controls for the heart of the sun\\" a song I've always liked, just sort of, until I heard this version. The Dark Side of the Moon stuff sounded good but seemed dull in comparison to a brilliant version of \\"Dogs\\" which made the 17 minutes just fly by. <br /> <br />If you're a Floyd Fan or a Roger Fan, or both, you'll find something in this DVD, to latch on to. Roger is defiantly the most animated of the Fab four which made up Pink Floyd in the 70's.    <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As a devout reader of the classics, I am always skeptical when a movie based on a classic literary work comes out.  I worry they will take out pivotal pieces of story, ruin an important scene, or cast the wrong actors for the parts.  Thankfully, North and South does none of these things.  In fact, I found this movie to be delightful with a well written screenplay and an excellent cast, particularly Richard Armitage as Mr. Thorton.  From his well tied cravat to his deep brooding stare, he embodies Mr. Thorton perfectly.  I have even begun to think he might be more handsome than Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, if that is possible.  I highly recommend this film to anyone.
B000FILW86|5.0|I own every single Cheap Trick CD.   For me, there are no bad albums from Cheap Trick, each has it's own sound and each has its own memorable songs.  Each album usually has one or two classics and most are perfect magic from beginning to end.   Some have been over produced (Busted), some too raw (The Monster), some too loud (One On One), but for me that never took away from the Tricks outstanding song writing and playing.   Which leads us to the 15th studio album.  Like In Color, Heaven Tonight, Next Position Please, and Standing On The Edge, Rockford is perfection from beginning to end.  They have never been more true to themselves than they have on Rockford...funny, snotty, and completely over the top, no one does power pop rock than the Trick.   Rick and Tom just sound like they are just having a ball on each track either n-sync or trading licks like they did in the seventies, and Bun E. has never drummed so tight and with so such percision.  Robin Zander, you have been a class act from the very beginning and you have never sounded better in your 30 year recording career.  It is WAY over due for this band to be honored in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  They have inspired so many young bands in its 30 year career, that the list would be a mile long.  With Rockford they deserve the crown.
B000BC8STM|5.0|She has given us so much for so long.  I am UK resident and had never seen a show of Cher's until they aired it on a TV channel here late one night and I taped it.  The interaction with the crowd, dancers and at times the band showed her great need to involve everybody in the show and you couldn't help but feel at times she was having a helluva good time doing it.<br /><br />Some of my all-time favourite songs with a couple it took me ages to track down.  I always remember her saying something along the lines of, 'remember how we look wearing all these clothes, because thats as dressed as we get' much to wolf whistles of the crowd.<br /><br />Perfection, Takin it to the Streets, If I could turn back time.<br /><br />She belted them all out, and she still found time to nip back stage, completely change her clothes and costume every so often and get back out again, a fully moving stage that had decks throughout gave her a crazy platform to sing from, one minute shes on the walkway, next minute shes up on a scaffold with guys playing pool.<br /><br />A lot of time and energy went into that show and it puts some of todays shows to shame.  This is from a time when a show was a complete spectacle and a wonder to behold.<br /><br />I have seen Cher in concert over here since and that was astronomical... but this is the performance I always think back on, maybe because it was the first I saw.<br /><br />There will only be one Cher, copied but never equalled!
B00005JP0A|5.0|When I saw the preview for this movie it looked good, but I had know idea how good it would really be! I never really respected Anne Hathaway for her movie roles (The Princess Diaries and Ella Enchanted mainly.) After I saw this movie, I changed my mind about her acting. In my opinion this is one of the best movies of the summer!

B00005JP0A|4.0|The Devil Wears Prada is a perfectly predictable movie about an innocent would-be journalist who takes a job with a \\"Dragon Lady\\" of a boss, certain that with a year of experience under her belt, she can get the job of her dreams as a \\"real\\" journalist. The danger is that our Sweet Young Thing begins to adopt the attitudes of the fashion-is-everything, ignore-friends-and-family values, and becomes what she once hated.<br /><br />It's fun summer fluff, an enjoyable romp held together with fine acting -- Meryl Streep *is* as good as everyone else says, and Stanley Tucci is a hoot -- especially if you look at it as an opportunity to be vicariously bitchy. Streep's awful bossiness -- if her coffee isn't on time, there's hell to pay -- is only part of the terrible culture of the office, in which meanness and snarkiness is seemingly the only way for people to interact. Since this is likely to be  worse than any real job you have ever had, it's a fun escape because you can laugh at the situation... and wish that YOU had thought of some of those smart-aleck responses.<br /><br />Some shows get all their laughs from people being mean to one another, and the result is offensive; I don't think it's funny to hurt other people. Somehow, this movie manages to keep the values in place: the mean people aren't presented as \\"gosh aren't you clever\\" role models, but simply as mean people. This stays a light summer flick, just the sort of entertainment you want from a two-hour escape.
0312979479|5.0|This is one of my favorite mystery books. It is so tightly plotted it fairly hums. There are no gaps in the logic. What is unusual is that you know after the first fifty pages or so exactly what is going to happen, yet the book cannot be put down. The characters are well developed and Dame Christie put a lot of thought into constructing a tight novel. In the long run that is what sets this book apart. This could be used as a role model ( and probably has been) for the logical construction and plotting of mystery books
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I had thought the theater-released version was good...this blows it away...now certain scenes don't feel out of place anymore...a richer and better developed story (don't want to give too much details and spoil it for you), but rest assured, it's a long one with intermission in the movie...but well worth it!<br /><br />Enjoy...
0345298349|5.0|This is one terrific book.  Layer upon layer, MCS created memorable settings and characters, as well as an exciting mystery.  Martin Cruz Smith is one of the finest writers of fiction, and his works are true literature.
0385336691|5.0|This is a book I've looked forward to for awhile...  The latest Jack Reacher novel.  The Hard Way by Lee Child is as good as I expected, and my only disappointment is that I have to wait for the next one...<br /><br />Reacher is sitting quietly having a cup of coffee when he sees a car being driven off across the street.  Only Reacher would notice it and be able to recite the details when a stranger asks him what he saw.  This leads to him being taken to meet the leader of a mercenary group who makes him an offer...  His wife has been kidnapped, and he needs Reacher to find out who is responsible.  Reacher decides to look into it, but quickly finds out that the kidnapping may not be all that it appears.  In fact, it may be a scam to cover up a murder.  Rather than walk away, he decides to find out the truth for the sake of the murdered wife and child, regardless of who's responsible.  He teams up with an ex-FBI special agent who also has an axe to grind with the mercenary for a killing years ago.  Just when Reacher thinks he's got the situation scoped out and is about to collect his fee, he realizes that his entire take was wrong...  Now can he recover from his mistake and keep innocent people from dying?<br /><br />Reacher is one of the most enjoyable main characters of any novelist I follow.  He's one of those invincible guys who has no problems doling out justice to those who work outside the law, but also has an air of vulnerability which makes you think that there's the off-chance that things might not turn out the way they should.  This probably wouldn't be the best \\"first Reacher\\" novel for someone, as you don't get much insight into his background.  Some of the quirks he has, like being able to keep exact time without a watch, don't make much sense unless you've come to know the character over time.  But even *if* this was your first exposure to Jack Reacher, you'd probably want to go back and read the rest.  For those of us who are already addicted, it's a great installment...s a great installment...

If you're not familiar with Rudolf Schenker's brother Michael, you must check out UFO.  Why they aren't more popular, I'll never know.  If you're looking for a guitar hero, check out Michael Schenker's guitarwork on the live version of Rock Bottom.

B00002E23E|4.0|Really I did -- usually along with Rocky Horror or a Jimi Hendrix film.  Had no choice since there was no video footage available to buy at the time.  Some parts are hokey, and it's a shame most performances are cut, but it's Zep in their heyday.  Does anyone else notice how much Crowe's \\"Almost Famous\\" rips off this movie (all the way down to the acoustic-accompanied limo ride through NYC)?  A better choice is the double Carruthers DVD.  That shows Zeppelin from their origins to their later years in un-cut performances.
B00005NRO3|3.0|Wes Craven's follow-up to his highly successfull 1996 self-referential groundbreaker is a big-budget gaudy mess of a movie, albeit an ambitious one. As with the previous film, the best part is at the beginning: a surreal Rocky-Horror like parody of a sneak preview of \\"Stab,\\" that chronicles the events of the first Scream film with gleeful self-parody and brazen exploitation (featuring Heather Graham doing some really sly comic work in the now-famous Drew Barrymore Gets Killed opening sequence). From that point out, the film degenerates into a somewhat routine self-parody as well, though this one not as funny or as shocking as the scene in the cinema. It's not bad, not at all....there are some good bits. However the overall tone is smug and a bit too forced, as screenwriter Williamson repeatedly tries to outdo his script for the previous Scream. Things get more and more chaotic (this has got to be one of the LOUDEST films in recent memory), but to no real satisfying end. The momentum doesn't hold this time and it plays like a made for TV film at some points. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox all wear on the nerves as their character's plot-lines and dialogue become so cloying and comfy-cozy we begin to realize they'll definitely be around for future installments, and given their limited ranges as performers, that's not necessarily a good thing. On the other hand, there are good solid turns from Jamie Kennedy (livening things up again as movie freak Randy) and from the supporting cast which includes Sarah Michelle Gellar in a \\"When a Stranger Calls\\" type homage, and Laurie Metcalf, who looks like she's having the time of her life serving up a very cold hammy casserole.
B000001EUL|5.0|A San Diego cover band in 1980 introduced me to Lovedrive and Loving You Sunday morning.  I've been a fan ever since, and bought earlier releases.  I didn't hear the Scorps on LA radio until Blackout was released several years later.  When I raved about the Scorps, people looked at me like I was nuts.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I bought this disc for the selection of John's tunes, however, the actual tracks on the discs are not what are listed on this site.  Levon and Little Jeannie are missing.  Did I get a bum copy?  It's good anyways.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is a flawless compilation of live Zep performances.  You get everything from the early years to the end and everything in between.  This band was and will always be the best rock band ever.
B000AA4JMU|5.0|I couldn't have been happier with this item! Oliver's sweetness and purity is enchanting, and the songs became glued in my memory for days afterward. The big numbers such as \\"Who Will Buy\\" and the simple solo pieces such as \\"Where is Love\\" are so moving; you will not regret your purchase! Perfect for anyone and everyone - can be watched over and over!! A+
B000001EUP|5.0|This album FINALLY got the Scorps noticed and played on the radio.  Now go back and get Animal Magnetism, Lovedrive and their original compilation (from In Trance, Virgin Killers, Fly to the Rainbow, etc).  That stuff never got radio-play and is not the pop most people are familiar with.
B000A7BD4K|5.0|I really loved this movie!  Jeff Bridges played a lovable alien in a really funny, innocent role.  Enough drama to keep you on the edge of your seat but lots of funny scenes.  Great entertainment for the entire family!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|The production on most live albums is poor.  This is awesome as are the songs.  UFO should have been much more popular than they were/are.  I first heard their music from a UFO/Scorpions cover band in San Diego way back in 1979.  Started buying up albums.  Gave Santa Barbara a taste of the Schenker Bros.  The sleepy beach city didn't know what hit them.  Of course, Scorps became mainstream shortly after that.  I still can't get enough of Michael's 5-minute Rock Bottom serenade.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Based purely on the reviews here, I purchased this (after choking on the price) as a replacement for a generic press that I'd used with marginal success for years. It arrived and I put it in the gadget drawer without using it.  A couple of weeks later my 8 year old found it , used it, and ran in to my office with an amazed look on his face demanding to know where I got the great new garlic press.  I almost fell over laughing, but it was a heck on an endorsement.  Oh, BTW, I tried it later and it does live up to its billing.
B000002KKS|5.0|Being a Dio/Rainbow fan, this is a perfect blend of the two bands' sounds.  It worked out for Ozzy too.  Blizzard of Oz exceeds what he did with Sabbath.  Change is sometimes a very good thing for all parties.  Get both of them!  I love Children of the Sea.

0312330537|5.0|Lindsay or Linbaba, as the Indian people named him, is a fugitive who escaped prison in Australia, where he served two years of his 19-year sentence of arms robberies, which he used to do to support his heroin addiction caused by loosing custody of his daughter in a failed marriage. After the escape, Linbaba lands in Bombay on a fake New Zealand passport. Upon landing, he meets Prabaker who plays the guide role and shows him even the most secretive parts of Bombay. In the same time Lindsay meets Karla, a beautiful Swiss-American who works at Leopold's café the place where all the ex-pats hang out. Linbaba falls deeply in love with Karla and the love takes a complicated role in the plot. Following one night when Lindsay is robbed of all his possessions, Prabaker brings him to the slums of Bombay where over twenty-five thousand people lived in extreme poverty. There, Linbaba becomes the \\"doctor\\", taking care of people illnesses: rat bites, dysentery, anemia, etc. His unfortunate fate brings him within the walls of Arthur Road Prison, a hellish place where he experiences the worst prison conditions. He is released from prison and Lindsay gets involved with the Bombay mafia, Abdel Khader Khan, which later on brings him in Afghanistan to fight against the Russians. <br /> <br />Roberts wrote the book in prison, two of the copies were destroyed in 13 years and then he succeeded to write the last copy for publishing. The writing approach is far from flawless, but the book has a magnetic appeal and it is hard to put down; its plot whirls into complicated events which are linked and explained in the end. The characters have fascinating personalities and have strong connections in the series of events. <br /> <br />It's interesting how the book reveals the underground scene of the 80s and how its ex-pats engaged in criminal activity to lead a high life in Bombay. Despite the criminal activity he gets dragged into, Lindsay comes out as a strong person with a great heart. Hislove for Karla grows stronger in time even if she cannot return the same feelings. He is a savior, a fighter and a survivor. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this book as a work of action thriller, travel guide, love story and superb epic.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|This cd is pretty cool.  For those of you expecting the usual Mike Patton weirdness, you may be disappointed.  This one leans more towards a mainstream sound than his usual fare.  Its a little on the more mellow side for those expecting Tomahawk or Fantomas type stuff, this leans more towards Mr. Bungle's more accesible songs. Still, a good album, great contributions from his friends my fav being Sucker with Norah Jones (just to hear her say Mother F****r is part of the charm).  This probably won't go down as my favorite Patton project, but it certainly is worth a listen at least.
B00005JOQS|4.0|Well, it's been a long time since the last Superman movie, and there's been a lot of buzz going around about this long-awaited sequel, as well as a lot of mixed reviews.  And, although my expectations weren't especially high (I loved the first two movies, but the last two were pretty awful), I have to say that I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />There was much speculation about how newcomer Brandon Routh would fare as the Man of Steel, but I would say he was more than adequate.  I do think he was trying a bit too hard to emulate Christopher Reeve, but he did a great job nonetheless.  But the real star here is Kevin Spacey, who did an amazing job as Lex Luthor.  His was a completely different take from the comedic arrogance of Gene Hackman's Lex, and much more along the lines of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex on \\"Smallville\\": more dark and intense, with a slight hint of insanity.  Parker Posey is also memorable as his ditzy sidekick, Kitty.<br /><br />If there's one thing this movie had on the old ones, it's the special effects.  \\"Smallville\\" was the first incarnation of \\"Superman\\" to really up the ante in the special effects department, so it was really cool to see that caliber applied to the big screen.  If nothing else, this movie is great as just pure eye candy, as the effects are really great.  The airplane scene is particularly exhilirating, and it's cool that, as with \\"Smallville\\", they made his heat vision look like actual heat waves, instead of just the cheesy red laserbeams of old.<br /><br />However, as great as this movie is, I do have a few small complaints.  First of all, as much as I like Kate Bosworth, I have to say that I was really disappointed with her performance as Lois Lane.  To me, she just really didn't seem like Lois at all, and although she's supposed to be older, and have a family and everything, it just really seemed like a completely different character, with none of Lois' trademark personality.  Maybe it's the sceenwriter's fault, and not hers, but I just don't think she brought any kind of familiarity to the character at all.<br /><br />Another small problem I had was the kryptonite thing.  The effects that the kryptonite had on Superman just seemed way too mild.  It's supposed to make him really weak, and be really painful, but in most of the scenes, it barely seems to bother him at all.  Like, there's one part where he lifts a giant piece of rock, filled with kryptonite, into space, while he's got a piece of it stuck in his side.  Under those circumstances, he shouldn't have even been able to get off the ground.  Now, it was supposed to be a sort of synthetic kryptonite, and maybe the effects just weren't supposed to be quite as severe, but that was never really made clear in the movie.  Also, the conflict with Lex seemed a bit too similar to that of the first movie, with him creating a huge natural disaster to make money off rebuilding (he even gives the exact same explanation, with his father telling him about land being a precious resource).<br /><br />But I realize I'm just being way too picky there.  As I said, this is a great movie, and definitely worth seeing at least once if you're into Superman at all.  Also, I thought the ending was really cool, and possibly left the door open for more sequels.  All in all, I'd say it's not quite up there with the first two movies, but definitely way better than the third and fourth.s, but I just don't think she brought any kind of familiarity to the character at all. <br /> <br />Another small problem I had was the kryptonite thing.

B000062X9B|4.0|Gravelly real old-time music sung by a master. <br />Track 6 is right on, gives me chills.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|When I told my Year 9s that a film I was going to show them about the worries and insecurities of a group of teens was made in 1985 they thought it would be a bore. I showed it to them and a few wanted to know where I bought it. The best movie made in the 80s. Period.
0790731452|3.0|This is, like, the awesomest picture of all time! <br /> <br />Okay, it isn't, but it delivers: it's got funny (lots of funny), it's got special effects (lots, too!), it's got pathos (only a little -- don't want to make it TOO serious), and it's got an absurd plot and a ridiculous finish. <br /> <br />It's a spoof of exactly what you think it is. Or maybe you're thinking of another movie, but it works as a spoof of that one, too; director Tim Burton has his usual gorey fun and gags, and pokes fun at -- er, pays tribute to (yeah, that's what I meant) -- more than one film from bygone days. <br /> <br />The one thing that worried me was Jack Nicholson; I get tired of Nicholson pretty quickly (I suspect that, somehow, the feeling is mutual). He is used well in this film: his usual pretentious self, but not over-used, and his triumphal speech near the end is very fitting, as is what happens right after. <br /> <br />So how come it only got three stars?!? Well, it's light fun; it's not a serious movie, it's not the most hilarious thing ever, so don't buy it if you want a masterpiece -- buy it if you want a good laugh and a fun watch.
B00005JP0C|5.0|LOVE this movie!!! I actually saw it twice and cant wait for it to come out on DVD.

B0002DKCMG|5.0|this is the kind of movie that i like the stories not heavy or confusing theres lot of laughs and theres also good music like scotty doesnt know if you like to watch funny movies but are trying to go away from the more serious comedies than give this one a try
B000C20VRS|5.0|The idiot Steveo who gave one star is a pure moron. He is no doubt a no talent bum who is jealous of others.  The acting in this movie was done very well, superb.  The music score was excellent and placed well with the scenes. Try and make a movie and put it all together STEVEO yourself, and see what you can do, you no talent bum. I admire people who are creative and who can use their imaginations to the fullest. It takes alot of creativity to produce a movie like Scarface.  STEVEO needs to do what he does best, acquire a job as a liberal critic for the homeless.
B00005JOQS|4.0|Superman (Routh) is back, five years after where \\"Superman II\\" left off.  He returned to Krypton, hoping to find some life still there, but when he found nothing, he returned to Earth.  As Clark Kent, he gets his job back at the Daily Planet, and is reunited with Lois Lane (Bosworth).  But, people have moved on.  Lois has a five year old son, and a boyfriend (Marsden).  She has also won a Pulitzer for an article about how the world does not need Superman.  Elsewhere, Lex Luthor (Spacey) is free from prison, and up to no good.  It seems that he has found Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and has devised a plan with what he found there that will wipe out most of the United States.  Once again, Superman must try to stop Luthor's evil scheme, and try to win the girl in the process.  But things will be a little more difficult this time.<br /><br />After almost two decades, Superman is finally back.  Bryan Singer takes the helm as director after bowing out of the X-Men franchise.  Not the wisest move, but it is the opportunity of a lifetime to bring back the Man of Steel.  He does a few things right.  First, he uses the backstory established in \\"Superman\\" and \\"Superman II\\", wisely ignoring \\"III\\" and \\"IV\\", and not having to do a complete reboot.  He attempts to have a look of continuity and even uses John Williams' famous themes from those films.  This IS the Superman we grew up with, he has just been away for a while.  Kevin Spacey is great as Luthor, bring menace and some humor to the role.  He even manages to inflict some pain on the hero.  On the weak side, Lex's plan is dumb.  For as smart as he is supposed to be, he has not really thought things through.  Kate Bosworth is weak as Lois, and James Marsden has the unenviable role of being the other man.  Brandon Routh does not bring much to the table as Superman/Clark Kent except a resemblance to Christopher Reeve.  Finally, the running time is way too long to support the story.  Some trimming could have improved the story's flow.<br /><br />Yet, for the most part, it works.  It is good to see Superman back after all these years.  The effects are top notch, and the movie is mostly fun.  I do recommend this movie, but I hope that the filmmakers are able to tighten things up the next time around.  A sequel is planned (duh), and could be better than this restart.  For now, we can enjoy what we have.tory's flow. <br /> <br />Yet, for the most part, it works.

B00015YVD6|5.0|I have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because I wanted my kids to see it. I was very young when I first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow. Good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in Asia.<br />Daryl Hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid. Tom was also perfect for the role. I can't say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, though, but it wasn't bad. I can't imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie.<br />I let my kids watch it finally together with my niece. We found ourselves teary-eyed in the end. It was just so touching, we couldn't help it. Even the theme song sang by Rita Coolidge was perfect for the ending. For those who wanna know, the title is \\"Love came for me\\".<br />I'm glad I purchased the anniversary edition. I have a home theater and the dolby 5.1 surround sound was just what I needed. It would have been better if DTS was used but I'm not complaining.<br />For those who are thinking of getting this, I hope you make the decision to do so. Tom Hanks is a certified great actor. This movie will soon be in line with the classics like \\"Gone with the wind\\" and \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". It's already a collector's item. You won't regret it! Besides, love stories don't get out of style.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I wouldn't call myself a hardcore follower of Batman, but I'd still say I was a pretty big fan. Batman was the first superhero I can remember hearing about. I used to draw pictures of him in the early grades of school. I watched the 1960s TV series and film, saw the Burton films, put up with the Schumacher ones had a comic or two, collected the trading cards, and even had the DC comics Super Dictionary (does anyone else remember that?).  <br /> <br />When I first heard that there was going to be a Batman film that would try to stay true to the origins of the comic, I scoffed. In the world of comics, particularly DC comics with all its retcons and reimaginings, could there really be anything that could be honestly considered true to Batman's origins? Plus, I heard that it was pretty serious, with humourous moments few and far between. Sure, I appreciate Batman's darker side, but I felt that a Batman without so much as a drop of humour would just be pretentious, and I avoided this film for a while, for fear I'd be disappointed. Eventually though, curiousity got the better of me, and I faced these fears and watched the film. I'm glad it did, Batman Begins is pretty good. <br /> <br />Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne, reflecting on his tragic childhood high up in the ice locked mountains of Asia. He's staying with the League of Shadows, led by the enigmatic Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Wantanabe). Under the wing of the equally enigmatic Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), Bruce comes to terms with the death of his parents (more or less) and begins to fashion his Batman persona, becoming the thing that he fears in order to scare criminals into submission. Though he once had many thoughts about revenge, Bruce no longer desires to kill lawbreakers and murderers, he only desires to bring them to justice. Putting this ideal into practice, he refuses to kill a man who has broken Ra's Al Ghul's law and returns to Gotham City, his home reuniting with his family butler Alfred (Michael Caine). Bruce, though wealthy by way of company shares, takes a job at his late family's business in the research department, headed by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who has access to many items of sophisticated technology. With his wealth, his access to high tech equipment, and a little bit of help from old Alfred, Bruce becomes Batman, and just in time too. There is something brewing under the streets of Gotham, something to strike fear in the heart of each and every citizen. Does it have anything to do with the Scarecrow, a figure that haunts the minds of the patients of Arkham Asylum? Does criminal bigwig Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has something to do with it, perhaps? It is all up to Batman and a weathered but honest policeman Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) to find out! <br /> <br />The film is rather fast paced, especially early on, so you have to pay a bit of attention. Kind of cut into the atmosphere a tad, but it doesn't matter too much. With such a fast pace, there's no time to be bored, and it means the movie's a lot shorter than it could have been (even then, it still goes for over 2 hours). Batman's look is a little rougher that we've seen in the Burton films, but that's understandable, as Bruce Wayne's just starting out. He also looks more like an animal in the suit than anyone before, I think, which is interesting. The Batmobile, too, is equally rough. Christian Bale puts on this gruff voice whenever he gets into his suit, which took a while for me to get used to, though it can be quite scary sometimes. Batman's scariness is emphasized quite a lot, actually, especially when he works with villains. Though not exactly a kids movie, this Batman is still regarded as a hero figure to them, which can be seen through the eyes of a particular child in this film, who meets Batman briefly and is sure he'll save the day when he and the rest of Gotham find themselves in danger.  Michael Keaton's still my favorite on screen Batman, but Bale is now my favorite Bruce Wayne. He plays unmasked Bruce as two distinct personaes, the decadent gadabout in public, and the brooding but driven soul in private. This Batman leads a triple life, which I thought was a fascinating concept.  Michael Caine was an unexpected choice for Alfred I thought, with his cockney accent and all, but he pulls it off (I still think that Michael Gough is the definitive Alfred though). Gary Oldman was a great Jim Gordon.As for the dialogue, it is dramatic, but it doesn't go as far as pretentious, which is good. <br /> <br />As I watched, I discovered that there was actually a little bit of humour in the film. It wasn't as much as there would be in, say, a Tim Burton Batman film, and not as much as I would have preferred, but it is there. Bruce Wayne's tabloid antics, for example, and the odd one liner delivered in a dry, jaded kind of way, which in a city so heavily burdened with crime is the way you'd expect the world weary Gotham citizens to crack a joke.  <br /> <br />I think director Christopher Nolan is onto something with this rethink/reboot, and the sequels could be really something special. I just hope he's careful, I can see a lot of ways this kind of take on Batman could go wrong. It could easily become really pretentious and totally humourless if he and the team aren't careful. It could get too gritty, the League of Shadows could be behind absolutely every villains plans, which would just be boring. Just have to wait and see how it goes. I do hope we get to see the Joker next! <br /> <br />The special features disc is rather unique. It's menus are set up like a comic strip, depicting a scene of the movie featuring Batman and Scarecrow. You can flick through the pages, and if you press certain remote arrows, you can find yourself highlighting a character or a word, easter egg style. Pressing enter on these comic elements will take you to a special feature, be it a behind the scenes featurette or a data file on a weapon, hero or villain. I wanted to see all the special features, and I was getting frustrated that I had to do all this fancy remote work when I flicked through to the end of the menu/comic and found an index page of most of the special featues, which was a lot easier to follow. Locations, models, sets, actors, writers... you can find out about everything on this disc. Well, everything I'd ever need to know anyway. <br /> <br />Definitely worth a look for fans of Batman, whatever the era, whatever the medium. Not my favorite, but its fairly high up there.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Good space Sci-Fi is hard to come by. And Star-Trek (TOS) created a lot of fanatics that were spoiled by great Star-Trek concepts for years. I speak for myself when I say that Enterprise was one of my favorites! Whether from great story lines, Computer graphics, or acting that was actually believable so you were locked into the story and couldn't wait for next week. The crew of the Enterprise was an outstanding cast that had personalities you loved. And we finally got a good Vulcan again. Jolene Blalock did a superb job and Scott Bakula was an obvious choice for an early pre-federation Captain. <br /> This series of Star-Trek makes you want to get going on space travel and since Kirk and Spock, We forgot about steps to get to where they were. The first time the transporter was used in an emergency situation made you proud. And the early dangers of space travel and new species that we took for granted were great writing.  <br /> I was very sadden that Enterprise never got to go as long as The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, or Voyager, but it was some of the best Star-Trek concepts ever... I will watch these disks over and over so this was a great investment <br />
0671027573|4.0|THis book was entertaining and made for a book that you didn't want to put down.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I felt that Jaine's falling in love so quickly and then marrying were more a symbol of how she herself had changed and not so much meant to be \\"lusty\\".  You know the author has done an excellent job when you mourn a character's passing.  The ending is both hilarious and serious which shows Ms. Howard's excellent writing.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I never heard of this young lady before June 27 when I was checking for reviews of the new India.Arie album (which I love by the way). Amazon had Corinne suggested as a buy together pair. I procured myself a copy and started listening.  <br /> <br />Within the first 10 seconds of Like a Star I was absolutely mesmerized. But one song does not an album make. I continued to listen and unbelievably, amazingly, this thing just kept getting better & better. Song after song, groove after groove. So cool, so smooth.  <br /> <br />I recommend this album to anyone who likes melodious lyrical singing with smooth jazzy rhythmic music. This album is a joyful treat, a fine gift from the UK to the rest of the world. I hope this young woman has plenty of this kind of sound stored up inside her. Music lovers of the world really need it.    <br />
B000F6IOC0|4.0|For those of you (or should I say \\"us\\") who really got into Kate Beckinsale's azz-kicking gory days in Underworld, here's your chance for more of the same. Even though three years have passed in our time, Evolution takes up right where the first movie ended, but thanks to the magic of flashbacks we get some more background info on the blood feud and how it all began.<br /><br />Way, way back, Alexander Corvinus had two sons, Marcus (Tony Curran) and William. The first was bitten by a bat and became a Death Dealer with the fangs to prove it, and the second was bitten by a wolf to become the forefather and prototype for the Lycans who get all furry and howl at the sight of a full moon.  William however, was unable to control his blood lust, and made quite a nuisance of himself, until he was hunted down and locked away forever, much to Marcus's dismay and anger. Having been double crossed by Viktor (Bill Nighy), Marcus is out for revenge, and of course for blood.<br /><br />Back to present day, the war between Vampire and Lycan continues, and Marcus is awakened with some new tricks up his wings and a burning desire to set William free. Standing in his way is Selene, the hottest vampire action heroine in recent movie history (Beckinsale naturally) and her trusty sidekick Michael the hybrid (Scott Speedman).  Between them they unknowingly hold the key and the map to William's prison, and soon find themselves in Marcus's sights.<br /><br />In between the fighting and hiding from the sun and such activities, the two leading characters manage to squeeze in a little nookie time, which of course provides some eye-candy for us the viewers with its strategic placement between all the carnage.  The story line is a bit confusing if you haven't been making notes, and don't ever ask Selene her age, but as far as action, CGI and drama goes, this one is a non-stop thrill.  Recommended for vampire lovers and blood suckers everywhere.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 5, 20062006 <br />
B0002W18MU|5.0|The mixing may have never gone underway prior to Cash's death, but Rick Rubin had a deep respect for Johnny and still does. This album treats his material with dignity and respect. When I read a new album was coming out a few months ago, I was wary. I thought \\"American IV\\" was a perfect way to end Cash's career, and I also thought \\"Hurt\\" was the perfect farewell song. But \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" may have taken that spot. It's heartfelt and moving, but not as pessimistic as \\"Hurt.\\" It reveals the heart of a man who is alone and a tortured soul, but he is finally experiencing peace. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if this is quite as good overall as \\"American IV\\" in terms of music and general dynamics, but if you aren't truly moved by this album, you probably need a kick-start to your heart.
0671799320|5.0|I can't overemphasize how good this book is. Published 15 years ago, it remains current. The oil industry continues to lay close to the center of the struggle for international power and survival in world affairs.<br /><br />Yergin is equally good at explaining oil's colorful and distant past and the events of more modern memory -  the oil shocks of the 1970s and the seizing of power by the oil producing states from the big oil companies.<br /><br />He makes comprehensible the ebb and flow of market forces and politics that constantly reshape the industry. He lays out the many fascinating personalities who shaped the business, from John D. Rockefeller to the Buckleys and Mellons, to the trading geniuses who shaped the European, Russian and Indonesian ends of the business, to the many adventurers who risked everything to find or secure huge oil fields.<br /><br />And he is invaluable at explaining the evolution of the oil situation in critical countries - Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. His explanation, for example, of the overthrow of the Mossadegh government in Iran in the early 1950s, and the restoration of the Shah to the throne, is not only illuminating but entirely at odds with the usual \\"imperialism at its worst!!\\" that socialist types like to hurl at it.<br /><br />I would be fascinated to hear Yergin's take on the events of the current day - whether or not the Iraq war is actually a \\"war for oil\\", as critics can't resist saying; how the perception of global warming or the booming Chinese and Indian demand affects the industry; and whether we're actually running out of oil. As readers learn, this particular doomsday scenario has been regularly predicted for more than a century.
B000000WF9|5.0|Michael Nyman wrote a feast of music for this haunting sci-fi film.  It's wonderful to have a soundtrack that is this good, one that you don't have to be hovering nearby in order to skip a track or two (or five!), because each track is equally lovely. A musically majestic piece of work---Bravo!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, I realize there's hardly anything I can say about this show that hasn't been pointed out by one or more of the more than two thousand reviews. It's REALLY that good.    I'd orginally only watched the \\"Shindig\\" episode on TV and I thought it was very entertaining, so it seemed odd to me when the show got the axe.     Or course, when the \\"Serenity\\" movie came out on DVD I rented it, and eventually bought it since I liked it so much (it wasn't screened on my town). That prompted me to get the Complete Season Set and I have to say that the only dissapointment in it is that it ends after only 14 episodes.     I just don't get it. This show was great and they killed it just like that.    I guess the show wasn't going the direction the FOX brass liked it to go. Maybe if instead of reavers they had vampires, and Mal and his crew were high-school age kids it would've gone on for season after season! Or maybe the show could've been centered on Simon and his adventures in a Core World Hospital! Yeah, \\"Osiris E.R.\\"! Then it could've gone on for ten seasons!    Don't get me wrong, I liked Joss Whedon's previous shows, but they were dumb kiddie fare. Very well written and entertaining dumb kiddie fare, I admit, but ultimately shallow. Or maybe I just never identified with the teen-angst angle.     On the other hand, Firefly was about regular people with regular worries. No demon fighting, world saving, fantasy-gimmicky-who'll-take-me-to-prom thingy.     The characters are not only very diverse personality-wise, they actually include all age groups like real life, from teenaged River to gray-haired but still tough Shepherd Book, with most of the characters being apparently somewhere in their thirties. Not just a \\"scooby gang\\" and a father figure. This show was way better and deserved a couple of full seasons.    So I guess that the heads of FOX must be the dumbest people ever. This great show gets the axe, whereas elsewhere on TV crap like \\"Charmed\\", \\"Mutant X\\" and even \\"Highlander: The Series\\" went on and on and on and on.     I guess the problem was that \\"Firefly\\" had something most TV shows don't. A plot. And an interesting one at that. And like all interesting plots, it was complicated and involved characters who weren't clear-cut, black-and-white, standard hero-villian stuff. So I suppose that would've made it hard to cash in on the mechandise, uh? I gather few parents would want to buy their little girl an Inara Serra Lunchbox, or a \\"How to fluently curse in Mandarin\\" handbook for their kid.     I guess the network thought the show was geared to the same audience as Buffy and Angel had been. It obviously wasn't.    Perhaps it'll pull a \\"Family Guy\\". I hope it does.
B0007GAERG|3.0|MC is one of the most talented, diverse singer ever. But this album is nothing but media hype music. There are some good songs, but alot of this material is something she could've used in her previous records. Same substance: boring ballads, guest rappers w/ no talent(well most of them), annoying dance songs. Daydream was a great album, but after that, she lost some of her talent, IMHO. (you can hate me for this, but it's my opinion). Any album after Daydream(Butterfly, Rainbow, Charmbracelet, Glitter) sounds the same sadly. But you can't deny her voice, though it has got annoying at times. So if you're an avid fan, you might have this already. The only really great song on here is the last track. Everything else is boring and sour. And the whole queen of pop thing: Madge and MC are two totally different ppl, so stop comparing them. Mariah has a greater voice, but I have to say Madge is the queen of pop (though she has created horrible music in the past couple of years). why? B/c she is more groundbreaking and more innovative than MC. I don't hate Mariah at all. Mariah has talent, but her music has never been groundbreaking like Stevie, Elvis, Prince and so on, though she has sell millions.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|For starters, the makers of MUNICH assume viewers will possess a certain knowledge base about the tragedy of the 1972 Olympics. For younger viewers, the documentary ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER is a great way to get up to speed.<br /><br />As for this movie, it's based on the book VENGEANCE, by George Jonas. That volume's verisimilitude has been questioned in some quarters. Given its subject, that's unsurprising. However, an NPR interview with a Mossad veteran kept sticking in my mind while watching MUNICH. The agent chuckled merrily at the notion of Israeli agents paying large sums of money for information, as opposed to just doing the intelligence gathering themselves.<br /><br />So when MUNICH starts with the dreaded \\"Based on real events\\" tagline, I was already wondering if Spielberg just wanted both free artistic license and a certain credibility. But before I get in too deep here, let me hasten to say that this movie is quite well made and worth watching. Look elsewhere for plot details; for my part, I found the movie very interesting and pertinent.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Tony Kushner's screenplay adaptation explores the issues of conscience and doubt for our assassins, but particularly reprehensible was his intercutting of our protagonist making love to his wife with shots of Israeli athletes being slaughtered in Munich. That seemed gratuitous and sicko-sexual to this viewer.
B000301YY8|5.0|I purchased the CD after hearing the song \\"You're Beautiful\\" but all of the songs on the CD are great. I especially like \\"Good-bye My Friend\\".
0679446230|5.0|I just finished reading this exceptional work by Chinua Achebe. I was hesitant at first, but once I got a chapter or two in to the text, man I was hooked.<br /><br />We find ourselves in Africa in the land Umuofia. We watch as the tribe lives and breathes and we specifically follow one man, Onkokwo. He is best described as a \\"man's man\\". His fear of failure and following in his father's footsteps produces a man who appears rough and drastic in his approach to life. However, as the novel progresses we see he is actually quite attune to his feelings and emotions. He is also philisophical in his thinking and is able to use common sense when others are still dreaming of tomorrows.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the change in the land of Umuofia with the arrival of Christian missionaries. The reader can see how culture, tradition and society can change by just a few small occurences. We see the effect each us has on the other.<br /><br />Mr. Achebe made me keenly aware of how I may view others whom I assume to be lower socially or civilly than myself. I strongly recommend this book not only as a great lasting piece of fiction, but as an insight into the complex enviroment we all live in.
B000E8QVWY|1.0|I'd just as soon watched paint dry than see this movie again!!  It was horribly slow!!    I enjoy Johnny Cash's music. I also enjoy Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon's acting abilities and felt they both gave great performances in this Johnny Cash Biopic, but felt the screenplay and narrow focus of Mr. Cash's life made the film unbearable.    The movie did a complete overkill of Cash's alcohol and drug addiction, overkill on the poor relationship Cash had with his father and need for his father's approval, and overkill on his hot pursuit of June Carter. I think it would have been nice to incorporate other aspects of his life too.
B00005JOQS|5.0|whatever you folks out there do out there this summer, go out and see this wonderful motion picture, and watch how a movie should be made, it is fresh ,it is old fashioned,it is spectacularly made, meticulus,thrilling, and ill go on to say the best superhero movie ever made.  great acting not over done, just the right elements of guesswork. every one is superb, kevin spacey is just plan mean but not overly so,  kate bosworth ...the right touch,  and of course brandon routh brings more to any superman than ive ever seen, he emotes more feeling by doing less than most actors might have tried.  and everone else is just simply magnificent.   this is ladies and gentleman is how a modern day movie can be made and was .   hats off to you bryan singer for making a movie for our ages....and to fight for truth , justice...and the  AMERICAN way.    A  number 1.    AN INSTANT CLASSIC.
B000E41MS6|5.0|This is Doctor Who for virgin Doctor Who people like me. I learned all the good things about the series, learned to love it and then watched them replace the key character. It is a harsh and brutal introduction to a great series.<br /><br />One thing on the DVD of note is the \\"Billie Piper jubbly reel\\", which I believe focuses on her singing career. Though I'm not 100% certain because I haven't seen it all.<br /><br />Still if you haven't given this show a chance, buy this and enjoy the hell out of it.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've been waiting, well let me rephrase that, I think every FF7 fan has been waiting for this movie. With the years we've waited, I think we got what we wanted. Great visual effects, great voice-acting (japanese), and story. NICE. HAVE TO BUY THIS!!!!!!!
B0002PUH2Y|4.0|very nice songs, very nice voice but the most important very nice woman
0618164413|5.0|This is a nice big book and it really does cover all the stages of the artists work. We vote this as a good gift for an adult or high school graduation gift for a kid who is \\"Curious\\" . If you are a grown up it is nice to have the whole set in one big book. BUT if you are a kid- nothing beats getting a hardcover single story book off the shelf and going through three or four stories. Worth the cash in hardcover for a collector. Soft cover is a great gift, and for tots- buy the series as individual books.<br /><br />\\"George was curious...\\"<br /><br />This is the phrase that lets every child know that the main character of George is about to encounter some mischief. This is a children's classic book and was created by a English speaking writer who lived in Brazil. H.A. REY and his wife were enchanted by the monkeys outside of their window and the antics surrounding how curious they were. This was not his the writers first character it is just his most popular series I encourage readers to buy the series of these books because they are the most fun read a few stories at a time. These books are quick bedtime reading and perfect snack size reading for a busy parent who is using reading as a reward.<br /><br />RICH CHICKS specializes in financial education and we review media that is purchased by women.

B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses). Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls.  <br /> <br />Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers. They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome. The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film). <br /> <br />However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard. The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim. The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion. <br /> <br />These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers. In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it.
B000001F5F|5.0|I suppose I fall into the \\"Good and Sensible\\" category, since I prefer U2's Old stuff. This is the first album I bought from them. Loved it then, Love it even more now.
0783226837|5.0|A delightful little film, an homage to all its b-movie predecessors. The duo of Fred Ward (Earl) and Kevin Bacon (Val)are some of the most likeable characters to have appeared on screen, starting out as Dumb and Dumber, but going on to save the day in true hero style.  <br /> <br />The regulation plot: A few monsters have appeared near Perfection, your standard remote, cut-off town in hicksville. They are huge, so what have they been living off so far? Why have they never before been seen? How did they get there? As the film points out, dunno. That kind of stuff never gets explained in this sort of movie. It's up to our intrepid heroes, aided and abetted by the motley crew of local residents (with the usual guessing game of who will get eaten by the end of the film - place your bets ladies and gentlemen), to save the day - whilst allowing time to fall in love, of course.  <br /> <br />I disagree with the reviewer who called the acting awful - it's perfect, in particular by the the central trio - FW, KB and the female lead, Finn Carter. Even in the ridiculous circumstances, you care what happens to them. OK, so some of our local residents are larger than life, but that's not the acting, that's b-movie.  <br /> <br />The hilariously appalling SFX add to all the fun, as does the wonderful victory cry by Kevin Bacon \\"Can you fly you ****er, can you fly?\\".  <br /> <br />A treasure and a treat. Put aside your intellect, take out your popcorn and enjoy.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is the greatest western I've ever seen, and on my list of the greatest movies ever made.  I am so impressed with it.  I've been watching the movies that made Time Magazine's list of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and very few of them can compare to this one, which happens to be on their list.  Their list should be honored to include Unforgiven, and not the other way around, because the Time Magazine list also includes a lot of inferior films to this one, like Citizen Kane, which can't hold a candle to Unforgiven.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a retired gunslinger raising two small children alone because his beloved wife died.  He accepts a job to kill two vicious men who mutilated a whore.  The bounty, raised by the whore's co-workers, is $1,000.  He has two other gunslingers to help with the job - Morgan Freeman and some young punk with bad vision.<br /><br />Gene Hackman plays the brutal sheriff who refuses to punish the evildoers.  He lets them go free, with a fine.  This infuriates the other whores, resulting in their offering a bounty.<br /><br />Character development and realism are two of the strongest traits of this great film.  It has a satisfying ending as well, which is important to me.  I'm not going to ruin it for you.  You've found one of the greatest films ever made.  Go get it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|If you like Banjos and old-timey music, this is the movie for you.  One of George Clooney's best work.  This flick will bring out your inner hillbillie or just make your inner red neck very happy.  Either way this movie is one of the best movies ever. Also John Goodman keeps it real.
0446678430|4.0|I think this is the best of the series. It is real easy to read which I like because you can finish it fast. It has some great lessons and makes some wonderful points about investing for future retirement. Anyone can learn something from this that they can put to good use.     There are a lot of generalities in this book but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. If you had to choose between this one and the first one I would choose this one. They both will get you thinking in terms of the big picture instead of the minute details of everyday life. I am currently investing in rental property and agree with the author that you must have positive cash flow in order to invest, which in a lot of markets you can't do right now.     Anyway this book will get you started down the road in the right direction which I must say a lot of them won't.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This CD deffinitely blew away my expectations, it is fast and catchy, yet remaining very punk. Rise Against has deffinitely made a huge step in the right direction with this CD. The Musicianship is very good, shows they are progressing as a band. They lyrics are also very good being about politics and religion. The diversity of the songs is relevant on the CD as well, the story-song (The Approaching Curve) shows the band can do something totally different yet be true to themselves. Do not judge the  CD by the single, many of the songs on this CD can blow the single out of the water, this is a great CD and i deffinitely think you should go and buy it right now, it is done very well. All of the songs are very good on the CD and are full of energy and can keep you going. The CD is a ride and it is a very smooth one, with no bumps along the road. Rise Against is deffinitely a band to lookout for.
B000FGGE68|5.0|It is a good sci fi action movie to watch. it wont win awards,but it is still a movie to atleast rent.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is an awesome album.  Chris Martin's hauntingly beautiful tenor voice is surreal.  Lyrics are at once touching, poignant, simplistically beautiful.  Everyone should own this one.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Okay this is the album that got a bizillion Grammy nominations and was platinum an infinate amount of times. Why? Is it because of the political messages? Is it because it's a concept album? I can't see why! This is the most overrated album of 2004.<br /><br />I'll start by saying that this is Green Day's biggest success since the equally overrated \\"Dookie\\". All of their other albums weren't so overrated but then this comes and disturbs the peace! People also claim that Green Day saved punk when in reality they only made it worse. Now we have sh i t bands like Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, and Fall Out Boy!<br /><br />Second of all the musicianship is not superb or talented. Billie Joe Armstrong in my opinion is the most overrated guitarist in history. He plays 3 chords at best and his solos are sloppy and unoriginal. Mike Dirnt is probably the strongest part of the band but his bass work can't even compare to Cliff Burton(RIP), Tom Araya, or Steve Harris. Tre Cool isn't an awful drummer but again he can't compare to legends like Dave Lombardo, Igor Cavalera , or Mike Portnoy. Billie Joe Armstrong is also a super annoying vocalist, don't even compare him to punk legends like Joey Ramone(RIP) or Glenn Danzig!<br /><br />Next we have the lyrics and concept. People praise this album because of its political messages but come on! They can't compare to stuff like Rage Against the Machine or Ministry! This album is also suppossed to be a concept album but this storyline is confusing and stupid. It's suppossed to be about some guy named St. Jimmy and this other guy known as the Jesus of Suburbia or something... ah fu c k it! It's super confusing and can't compare to classics like \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\"!<br /><br />In conclusion this is an overrated album that has a lot of fuss for no reason. Get some underground stuff instead.
B00005MP58|5.0|For me, this is one of the best British productions that I have seen. The acting was top-notch, music was wonderful, and the language(Oh the language!)used was so Austen-esque that I was giddy with delight. The dialogue was just perfect!
0064471837|5.0|I love this book. Fast-paced and extremely engaging I couldn't put it down. It's hard to create a world and characters on paper and make them seem so real and believable, that when you see or read that you know a truly awsome writer has been born. For people who enjoy fast-paced fantasy adventure like Harry Potter and the Artemis Fowl Trilogy will enjoy this series.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Although he may not have directed this one, Quentin Tarantino's flavorings is all over this horror movie. <br /> <br />After all that I had heard about this film's torture sequences, I didn't think there was that much. I really thought they were gonna show more than they did.  <br /> <br />A notch above the average teen slasher flick, HOSTEL titillates viewers with sex, drugs, and extreme torture. This was way better than this director's first movie, which to me, was quite boring and forgettable. Not so for HOSTEL. <br /> <br />I wonder what is in store for us with HOSTEL 2...?
B00005JOQS|5.0|This is what movies are for!  I have seen all of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies and to me he will always be Superman, but Brandon Routh looks enough like him that you forget all that.  The movie was entertaining from beginning to end.  The best!
B000F1IQMS|4.0|I remember this timeline faintly as a wee lad. So for that reason, along with the fact that most of Steven Spielberg's films are good, I decided to see this film. <br /> <br />Other than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, one of my all-time favorite war films, MUNICH didn't seem like the typical Spielberg film. No WAR OF THE WORLDS nor dinos here. But an assembly of assassins that one won't soon forget. Set in the early 70's, MUNICH takes one back to when terrorists first started making their appearance on American TV's.  <br /> <br />Highly political, with intrigues and mysteries of various dark organizations, MUNICH takes you through a labyrinth of dark corridors throughout Europe and stains each one with blood. <br /> <br />With a rich ensemble cast, MUNICH is tightly well written, although some may be somewhat lost in the various long histories of the several peoples involved. But the main character, the leader of the assassins, played by The HULK's and TROY's Eric Bana, does a great acting performance here.  <br /> <br />There is a lot going on in this film. Lots of action and intrigue. But most of all, it makes one look at the heart, perhaps the very root of the problems at several warring factions. If you have nearly 3 hours to kill, then this film is for you. <br /> <br />It is an important film.
B00005JOSS|3.0|My girls (15 and 17) had constant questions about this movie after it was over and there was a lot of stuff that didn't make sense. You have to really be into the time/space continuum for it to all be clear to you. I guess for entertainment purposes, it was ok, but not my favorite movie.
B000268QB2|5.0|I love the sound of Keane on this album, the harmonies of the background music and the lead singer's voice blended into the music. I will say that the songs do all sound similar in a way, but since I enjoyed that sound, I didn't mind it at all. (And from the one song I've heard from their new CD, the sound is definitely different, but still great!) I have multiple copies of the CD so that I can keep a copy in multiple places and listen to it whenever I need some great music. I'm looking forward to buying their new album when I get a chance!
B00005JNRY|5.0|Purely entertaining - a real feel good movie.  Another summer hit.
0385338694|3.0|I am not usually a fan of chick lit, but this has gotten so much press I decided to give it a try. It's funny, lighthearted and entertaining, a great beach book or airplane book, but it isn't literature, so don't look for a very plausible plot or character development. <br />I found the ending somewhat disappointing - not that she turned down the high-pressured career in favor of a simpler life (I know lawyers who have worked for huge, big-name law firms and while the rewards are impressive, the hours and pressure are enormous) - but why is her only alternative going back to be a housekeeper? This is someone who graduated at the top of her class - it never occurs to her to say, join a small, laid-back firm outside London or even open her own law practice, where she could choose her own clients and set her own hours? It's a gap in logic, in my opinion.
B00005JOVH|5.0|The trailers for this movie sent me to the video store to purchase XMen 1 and 2 - I had never had any interest in them before.  My husband and 15 year old daughter also loved them.  We really enjoyed this movie (the 15 year old wasn't with us - not sure she'll forgive us for that!)
B00005JMX6|5.0|this movie is the perfect blend of teenage immaturity and perversion we have all come to love thanks to movies like american pie and likes. it has your average high school student makes good grades, president of the student council, etc. who falls in love with the lady who is housesitting his neighbors house...he falls in love with her only to find she is a porn star, and things go downhill for him from there. this is a movie to be watched not as a teenie bopper flick but seriously, it has a perfect blend also of comedy and drama. fans of the american pie type of movies, and fans of porno both should love this one, it will go down in history.
B00001IVOF|5.0|This album is a classic, there are no bad songs on here. This album has a real dark & grimey feel to it (which i love). This and \\"The Infamous\\" would be my 2 favourite Mobb Deep albums. I highly recommend this to all fans of rap. This is a must-have in your collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|there are no liner notes in this album. the music is dark and all of the songs fit together really well...it really shows off why justin chancellor was such a perfect fit for tool, even more than aenima in my opinion. It is a lot different than aenima and undertow and opiate, i think this is the one that everyone who wants to get into tool should start with. grooving bass and spooky guitar riffs jam pack this musical masterpiece. Even if you already have heard tool on their earlier albums and didnt particularly care for them, then this is the record for you, i am pretty sure it will show you why they are still around after all this time, it really cements their place in musical history as a band that will not be forgotten
B000E5KJD4|1.0|I cant say much about the HD DVDs as over in Australia we do not have HD DVD players as yet and dont know when they will be available.

0783225849|5.0|Psycho remains the greatest thriller ever made. I consider it Alfred Hitchcock's last great film (apologies to all Birds lovers out there - I'm sorry, but in Hitchcock's standards that movie really was mediocre at best) as well as the best he had made, and the one in which the efforts of terrific films like Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest finally culminated into one timeless masterpiece. Hitchcock knew what most of today's directors of thrillers and horror movies have forgotten - how to build up tension and sympathy for his characters. In no film did he do it better than in Psycho. And so, even if it doesn't seem half as violent and horrific as it did four and a half decades ago, and even if the shower scene isn't as convincing as we'd like to remember, it's still one of the scariest and most effective thrillers ever made.<br /><br />Psycho was clearly years ahead of its time, and it laid the groundwork for modern thrillers from Taxi Driver and The Conversation to Fight Club, Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Other than the fact that it's a perfectly constructed film, from the opening titles (by the great master Saul Bass) and the wonderful music (by the irreplaceable Richard Herrmann) which compliments and build the tension and horror to perfection; to the editing, the subtle dialogue and the construction of each scene and each shot - Psycho stood out for the focus Hitchcock put for the first time on the villain character, to whom the heroes - Janet Leigh as the victim, John Gavin as her lover, Vera Miles as her sister, and of course the great Martin Balsam as the investigating detevtive - all take second place.<br /><br />Norman Bates is not only a lifetime performance for the great Anthony Perkins; he is the single greatest creation in the entire Hitchcock catalogue, and one of the most fascinating villain characters in film history. It may be remembered that in Hitchcock's previous films - Rear Window in particular springs to mind - the `madman' or villain character was the most unsatisfying and undeveloped element of the film. The murderer's motives are tackled here head on, and in this way it foreshadows many of the greatest thrillers of the 70's, 80's and 90's. Psycho is not about discovering the identity of the killer - that much can be figured out by any viewer from the first time Norman Bates is on screen. It's about exploring Bates's mind and psych; his dialogue is written to perfection and Perkins's performance goes without a hitch.<br /><br />The only scene I still have problems with is the one in which Simon Oakland appears as a psychiatrist to explain to us Bates's motives and his story, thus spelling out what it seems an observant viewer can figure out for himself. Still, maybe viewers in 1960 weren't as immersed in psychological thrillers as we are today and so needed the explanation. This scene - anticlimactic and slightly too long - aside, the finale is still one of the most memorable and chilling in film history, and in my mind more impressive that the famed shower scene, making the entire film an unforgettable experience and one of the most effective ever made. Psycho is an essentiality to any cinema lover.illain character was the most unsatisfying and undeveloped element of the film.

This scene - anticlimactic and slightly too long - aside, the finale is still one of the most memorable and chilling in film history, and in my mind more impressive that the famed shower scene, making the entire film an unforgettable experience and one of the most effective ever made. Psycho is an essentiality to any cinema lover.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Ah, what can be said about `Titanic' that hasn't already been said?  What possible input could I have to offer that you haven't already heard?  I doubt much, but I'm going to give you my opinion anyways, basically because I've been wanting to write this review for months now, and it wasn't until five or six minutes ago, when the credits got finished rolling that it all came to me...what I needed to say. <br /> <br />`Titanic' has already been cemented in the history books as one of cinemas finest accomplishments, hailed by critic after critic as the best disaster film ever released, and even further, one of the greatest films ever...period.  `Titanic', even after all the hype, truly lives up to it's name and is deserving of every ounce of credit and attention it receives, and yes, despite what many believe and contrary to all the `LA Confidential' fans (I being one of them) `Titanic' truly deserved to win the crown.  (I just wish it could have been a tie, I mean, `LA Confidential' is just as magnificent...) <br /> <br />Now, I truly believe that `Titanic' won for one reason and one reason only, and no it's not because of all the so-called `undue' attention or `over' praise.  I believe `Titanic' won because it struck a chord with modern day America, much like the recent `Brokeback Mountain' (although `BBM' didn't fair as well at the Oscars).  Watching `Titanic' for what must have been the hundredth time I realized something throughout that I wasn't privy too before, or at least didn't take the time to notice.  `Titanic' is less about a ship sinking then it is about a woman being set free from the chains that are binding her to a sinking ship (that ship being her life, not the literal sinking Titanic).  I mean, it's something I've always known and I assume everyone who has ever seen `Titanic' (which is pretty much everyone) has known, but it wasn't until tonight that it really sunk in.  Like Bill Paxton's character states towards the end of the film... \\"For three years I've thought of nothing but Titanic, but I never got it.\\"  That's how I felt tonight.  I've seen this movie plenty of times since it's release but it was tonight, staring into Rose's eyes that I truly got what this movie was all about. <br /> <br />The love story between Rose (Kate Winslet...just breathtaking) and Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is just a sideline, just a plot to keep you watching, but it's the growth that Rose's character undergoes, the release sort-of-speak that she encounters that really is the base of this extraordinary film.  Rose is a woman trapped in a life she wishes to be no part of, a life that she never asked for yet was forced upon her by her overbearing mother and her controlling and manipulative fiancée (Billy Zane in a commanding and Oscar snubbed performance). <br /> <br />As everyone is aware, this film revolves around Rose and Jack as they live out an ill-fated love affair for a few days, defying all odds to be with one another, and as Jack sinks to the bottom of the ocean your left with a feeling of contentment, for even though Rose is losing the only man she's ever loved you know she has gained more in the past few days then she'll ever gain in her lifetime.  She gained happiness and the will to move on.  You can read this in her face.  There are two scenes in particular when you see this transformation in Rose.   <br /> <br />The first is when the boat is sinking and the lovers are at the back of the ship.  They have yet to climb over the railing and Rose is looking to each side of her.  She glances to her right and she sees a young woman gripping the railing for dear life and she's all alone.  Rose looks up at Jack and then back to the woman.  You can see in her face, Rose's face, that she knows she has everything she needs with her at that very moment.  She has no need for anything else, and you can see this growing pity for the young girl, there all alone, for she has no strength to survive when you have no one to live for.  Rose has a reason to hold on. <br /> <br />The second is after the boat has sunk, when Rose first realizes Jack has died.  After the initial shock is over and she has stopped repeating his name she lays her head on his hand and closes her eyes, catching her breath, and as you can only imagine, contemplates whether she really wants to be rescued.  Why should she live without the man she loves?  But before the thought can fully cross her mind her eyes are open and you can see this conviction, this dire motivation to live.  Jack gave her the strength and the reason to live, with or without him.  He showed her that she doesn't have to be trapped; she doesn't have to be what they (her mother and her fiancée or anyone really) want her to be.  She is her own person, and as we realized the moment she jumped from the lifeboat back into the sinking ship, Rose has taken hold of the life she should have never let go of in the first place. <br /> <br />Everyone gets so wrapped up in the fact that Jack dies that they forget this isn't about loss as much as it is about life.  As Rose states at the end of the film... \\"Jack saved me, in everyway a person can be saved.\\"  A friend of mine told me that she hates this film for the reason that the love affair between Jack and Rose is unbelievable.  She said that there's no way that these two could have fallen in love.  I told her she missed the point, and that she did!  Regardless of whether or not Rose `loved' Jack, he was her everything because he was the only one who `gave' her anything.  Everyone around this poor girl was taking advantage of her, using her for their own personal gain, but Jack was the first person who ever saw her for who she was and looked for ways to make her happy, to `do' for her and not take away. <br /> <br />Rose loved Jack for setting her free.  It's up to the viewer to decide whether or not these two were truly in love, but I think it's foolish to believe that these two weren't in one way or another morethan just lovers.  I personally feel they truly loved one another, for when Jack says, \\"winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me\\" you believe him for you know he's right.  But more so than loving him, she needed him, and that's a key point to remember. <br /> <br />`Titanic' will always be remembered as cinematic genius, but lets not forget the reason we love this film so much.  `Titanic' showed us so much more than a sinking ship, and gave us so much more than a glimpse at the terror of that fateful night.  It gave us inspiration to live, reason to find meaning in our lives and live each day as if it were our last.  As Rose toasts to her dinner mates... \\"Here's to making it count\\" and that's the point isn't it. <br /> <br />As the final frames of this film roll on we see a desk cluttered with pictures of young Rose making it count, doing everything that Jack inspired her to do.  She no longer lived her life controlled and afraid but she put caution to the wind and lived, plain and simple.  I want to take a moment and mention that this film would have been nothing had the beautifully talented Kate Winslet not been a part of it.  She embodied her character and proved to be the lifeblood of this beautiful and heart wrenching film.  With just her eyes and the slightest movement in her face she creates a feeling and tells a story that all can read, a story of a young woman afraid of everything, a young woman that finally learned to love, to live and to fly (cut to corniest part of the film for visual effect... \\"I'm flying!\\"). <br /> <br />I'm sorry Helen, but Kate deserved that Oscar...hands down! <br />
B000FA57RG|5.0|I am a VERY lucky Madonna fan who was blessed enough to win \\"dance-pit\\" tickets to the Re-Invention Tour in New York City.  Only downfall of those tickets was that I saw the concert from a perpindicular angle (which I'm not complaining about because she super rocked and was never more that 15 feet away!) but was hoping to see it from a more head-on position in the concert DVD. While the \\"Secret\\" DVD has some stunning examples from the concert, anyone who was not able to attend will never see the great military version of EXPRESS YOURSELF or the childlike playfulness in Madonna's face when she sang PAPA DON'T PREACH.  I lOVE LOVE LOVE you Madonna, but I (like most of your fans I imagine) want to keep the memory of your incredible concerts fresh in my mind all the time, revisiting one of the most incredible experiences I've had, by watching your concert videos.  BTW Confessions Tour blew me AWAY!
B000244EMO|4.0|That was the tagline I believe for this very smart, very fun movie.  At the time that was a very true statement.  I still remember the first time I saw this film.  I was chilled to the bone unlike I had ever been before (granted I was only 13).  The film follows a group of US Army Commandos led by non other than the manly man himself Arnold Schwarzenegger (of whom I am NOT a fan but he works here) as they are picked off one by one by a mysterious creature.  This creature has come down to hunt men and that he does.  The action is top notch, and the final showdown between man and beast is brilliant.  Even now, almost 20 years after the film's release, it's still top-notch entertainment.  From the moment we see the skinned bodies hanging from the trees to the moment we hear that horrid creature laughing as he knows his life is over we are glued to our seats and ingrossed in one of the best action films ever to be released.  And to think, this stars Arnold?!?!?!
B00004Y5A8|5.0|CD2 - The first CD could be a symphony of (flatus) and I'd still give this release 5 stars for the nearly immaculate performances on the second disk. In particular, \\"Hang Onto Yourself\\" (track 3), \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" and \\"Suffregette City\\" (featuring Mick Ronson making this totally hot kissing noise with his guitar) crackle with energy. It is truly a thrill to hear these old favorites in such a new (as such) and exciting light. Bowie and Co. burn down the BBC studios. Repeatedly. Any rock fan (but especially an old Bowie fan, of course) is likely to meltdown in ecstacy upon hearing this.<br /><br />CD1 - Many hardcore fans will surely (sweet milk) over CD1 as well although I'm not personally crazy about all of it. Some of David's early British folk period is represented which can be a bit hippy-dippy at times. The first 4 tracks, recorded in May of '68, fit that description although they do feature brilliant in-studio orchestral accompaniment.<br /><br />Much of CD1 does in fact rock. \\"Let Me Sleep Beside You\\" and \\"Janine\\" are very good, easy-going rockers recorded with Junior's Eyes who had a short-lived collaboration with Bowie. The session was never broadcast. Bowie delivers a stunning solo performance of Jacques Brel's \\"Port of Amsterdam\\" (vocal and guitar). The same session shows off Mick Ronson just a few days after hooking up with Bowie for the first time. They perform an intriguing, half-written version of \\"Width of a Circle.\\" Ronson really cuts loose on \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\" and \\"Cygnet Committee\\" is positively intense. Some studio hum can be heard on the session, an atmospheric reminder of the electric nature of these proceedings (that may or may not appeal to the listener). \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" had sadly been edited for time and remains so.<br /><br />Recorded in June of '71, the last session on CD1 features all of the future Spiders From Mars as well as some friends on vocals. Also along for the ride is guitarist Mark Carr-Pritchard who played for a phantom Bowie project called Arnold Corns. Early embryonic versions of \\"Moonage Daydream\\" and \\"Hang Onto Yourself\\" were recorded and released under that name. The group stomps through \\"Bombers,\\" a rare HUNKY DORY-era cut that sounds better (and less cheesy) than the studio version which I have as a bonus cut on the RYCODISK release of HUNKY DORY. \\"Looking For A Friend\\" is a country-ish, Stones-y rocker and they also turn in a rousing cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Almost Grown.\\" And Bowie performs \\"Kooks\\" solo on vocal and guitar which he had just written for newborn son Zowie.<br /><br />Note: Those concerned about excessive voice-overs from BBC radio hosts (like the ones that marred the Jimi Hendrix BBC release) can relax. There's very little talking over the songs and quite a bit of interesting Bowie banter on CD1. CD2 has nothing but back-to-back songs. Thankfully, tracks begin with actual songs, not the preceeding dialogue.or a phantom Bowie project called Arnold Corns.

B000002MP2|5.0|I love this entire album. I can listen to it 4+ times in a row. Man, I LOVE Green Day! People who say that they are posers are total asswhipes. Buy It. Everyone.
B000002G89|1.0|32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad.
0679805273|5.0|I received this book when I graduated first grade.  It was one of the books that I took with me every year when I went away to college.  It is one of my favorite books and it is a simple, honest picture of life- there are ups and down, but you will succeed.  I've gotten it for other friends as college graduation presents.
6305971935|3.0|This is the type movie that is interesting because of the era that it was filmed in.  Not very sophisticated FX but the story line is paced well and is supposed to be based in an actual event that occurred.  Nancy Allen is good as a friend to the confused sailors that go through the experiment and try to cope with the results of being transported into the future. Michael Pare is okay in the lead character role and this film sort of runs along the lines of the Kirk Douglas feature where an entire modern day aircraft carrier is transported back in time to December 7, 1941, except that because of a similar time travel misshap, the Philadelphia Experiment transports two young sailors into the future.  This is a decent \\"B\\" movie good for a late Friday or Saturday night viewing and interesting enough to watch from time to time.  I liked it, that is why I jumped at the chance to add it to my collection.
B000BHHVPO|4.0|FYI, the song \\"7 seconds\\" was sung by Youssou N'Dour and ANNIE LENNOX and NOT DIDO.

B000EQ4G5K|5.0|At first I didn't like the cd but it grows on you.  <br />   <br />  MY TOP 3 FAVORITES <br />  1. Final Goodbye <br />  2. Unfaithful <br />  3. Million Miles Away <br /> <br />  I Love Final Goodbye out of all the tracks. When I first listened to the cd I skimmed through the songs and didn't listen to the song all the way but when I was on vacation and didn't bring but 3 cd's I got bored and listened to the whole cd and Final Goodbye was just an amazing song. I loved how at the beggining it starts slow and then the beat really kicks in. I liked it because it was different from the rest of the songs I've heard. The only thing I wished was that the song had another verse or two to it. It felt like the song was short but I loved the song though! Great job! <br />

B00005JP4U|5.0|Whether you believe Al Gore or not, every American out there has a duty to watch this movie or find some other way to get involved understanding the *facts* behind global warming. <br /> <br />I have read articles saying the movie is amazing, and some articles saying it stretches the truth, etc. But regardless it is incredibly eye-opening.
B000059Z8J|3.0|I still remember as a kid when this came out the year after Star Wars redefined what going to the movies was. The expectations were so high, and yes this Superman delivered. We believed that a man could fly! <br /> <br />More than a quarter of a century has passed and the movie does not stand the test of time very well, specially the special effects, what then blew our minds looks pedestrian at best today. The plot does have a lot of holes and it is unbelievable, but if we watch thru the eyes of a child this movie is still what was born to be, the best Superman to date and great fun. <br />
0380018179|5.0|The Thorn Birds is one of my favorite novels. It is a story that reflects the wild nature of life, the unruly heart, and determination of spirit.

B000EMGAGW|2.0|Mobb Deep caught a lot of flack for joining forces with the G Unit but in all honesty I could not complain because 50 Cent has shown his pedigree from a song writing perspective and the idea of Mobb Deep with a \\"billion dollar budget\\" to make an album kind of excited me. After listenning to the album I must say that I do not think that Curtis Jackson tried to change their style. I'm sure he made sure that they include tracks like \\"It's Alright\\" and \\"Backstage Pass\\" which are not your typical Mobb tracks. In truth though they had been attempting to make tracks like these for the last couple of albums without much success and these efforts are no worse than their previous efforts.<br /><br />The album as a whole is not bad but admittedly it's a bit of a let down after all the hype. Although I do not think that this has anything to do with G Unit. The beats are grimy as we would expect, \\"Stole Something\\"  \\"Creep\\" \\"Put 'Em In Their Place\\" sound fresh without straying too far from the Mobb Deep formula. \\"Daydreamin\\" and \\"Speaking So Freely\\" are as dark as any track Mobb Deep ever rapped over. The only tracks that have clear G Unit fingerprints besides the above mentioned are \\"Pearly Gates\\" \\"Capital P, Capital H\\"  and \\"In Love With The Moula\\" which are great tracks.<br /><br />So what is wrong with this album? I think that it is the same thing that is wrong with LL Cool J's or Wu Tang Clan (except for Ghostface) albums. Mobb Deep are just no longer relevant. What made them special back in the day was their grimy, I don't give a ..... attitude. But now people do not really care about grimy. We wanna hear backpacker music with style ala Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco etc. or Crunk/Hyphy music with Gangsta undertones ala T.I., Young Jeezy or Dipset. Ther's no place in the game for that dark sound that these guys are known for. And everytime they try to adapt to the new sound that is hitting they fail or are called sellouts. They just can't win. I think Hav still has a career as a beatsmith and P should just take up Ghost writing, there's enough relevant MC's with whack lyrics out there.a beatsmith and P should just take up Ghost writing, there's enough relevant MC's with whack lyrics out there.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|Basically I own all of System of a Down's album and I actually like most of their material(especially the first album and Toxicity) But this album had a different sound, instead of some fast paced work, it was more melodic and less hardcore. I wondered, where did Daron's soloing that he had in the debut, why was Serj pulled downed to the side? where did his growl go? why are some songs very repetitive? and why did Daron hijack the group and take the spotlight? I'm not one to say that Daron nessesarilly killed this band on purpose, but took it to a different direction which had its ups and downs.  <br /> <br />John and Shavo's rhythm work is very good, Serj still has a raw energy but wasnt nearly all present but Daron's guitarring was weak at points, his music lyrics made very little sense,with many borderline emotional tracks  and not that he has an awful voice but the last time I saw Serj Tankian was the lead singer of the band, someone with great vocal range. Hopefully on the next album we'll see Serj growl again, Daron solo again and have stronger and more brutal songs. Some songs that I did like were Holy Mountains, Attack, Kill Rock n' Roll, Hypnotize and U fig. Id suggest you pick their self titled debut instead.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Sorry, I want the original, *cleaned up* trilogies, not some outddated laser disc transfer from the 1990's.  This DVD is going to be in no way shape or form up to today's standards.  Your basically buying a movie that is going to slightly better than your VHS copy of Star Wars.  Is that what you want? Sorry but those are the facts.
B00005QEO1|5.0|BAND: Steven Tyler (vocals, piano, harmonica), Joe Perry (guitars), Brad Whitford (guitars), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1989) 10 songs clocking in at approximately 48 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing band photos, song titles/credits, and thank you's. Recorded at Little Mountain Sound Studios, Vancouver BC, Canada. Label - Geffen.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Pump\\" is Aerosmith's finest album of the 80's. Absolutely positively no filler. As good as the mega hits are (\\"Janie's Got A Gun\\", \\"Love In An Elevator\\"), the deeper album cuts are what makes this album great. The opening 1-2 punch of rockers \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"F.I.N.E. (F**cked up, Insecure, Neurotic & Emotional)\\" set the tone of the album. \\"Monkey On My Back\\", \\"The Other Side\\", \\"My Girl\\" are wonderful songs proving the Toxic Twins were able to separate themselves from their past demons (in the late 70's and early 80's). One of my favorite obscure Aero tunes is here... \\"Hoodoo/Voodoo Medicine Man\\"... great lyrics and layers upon layers of ultra heavy guitars. This latter day Aersomith feels the need to incorporate a power ballad into each album. Where its predecessor (\\"Permanent Vacation\\") serenaded us with \\"Angel\\", \\"Pump\\" scored an even bigger ballad hit with \\"What It Takes\\". A good song, even if it is geared toward the female population. Later albums (i.e. \\"Get A Grip\\", \\"Nine Lives\\", \\"Just Push Play\\") are simply saturated with the rock ballads... and I can't and won't rate them as high. Aerosmith is best when they're rockin' the house - bluesy raunch & roll style. Aerosmith got their act together after several sub-par albums (well, certainly not 'classics' anyway) in the late 70's and early 80's, and they've rebounded nicely. Dare I say they were almost starting from scratch after \\"Rock In A Hard Place\\" (1982). Thankfully Perry and Whitford rejoined the band and have been cranking out albums ever since. I don't rank \\"Pump\\" as high as \\"Rocks\\" or \\"Toys In The Attic\\", but it's still in that special 1st tier of their albums. Classic Aerosmith 80's style (4.5 stars).The Attic\\", but it's still in that special 1st tier of their albums. Classic Aerosmith 80's style (4.5 stars).
B000F3UAFC|4.0|This more modern adaption of Wilde's story is pretty good. It was a pleasant way to spend 2 hours. The acting ability of Scarlett is still up in the air in my opinion. I'm not sure. She seems in every movie I have seen her in to be kind of...stupid, naive and clueless. Like an a-duh style of acting. And Wow Helen Hunt is looking very broke down. Old and tired. Annette Benning would have been a better choice.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I've seen this film several times, and it NEVER ceases to scare me... it concentrates on the true power technology holds in the world, and the devastating results that can occur when technological problems arise. An error in our defense system sends an erroneous message to fighter pilots patrolling our airspace, who obey it and head off to bomb Moscow! The situation is handled, if not resolved, with a truly horrifying result. <br /> <br />No shortage of GREAT acting here... Henry Fonda as The President... Larry Hagman as the translator who helps during phone conversations between The President and his Russian counterpart.  And Walter Matthau as a Civilian Advisor. As always Matthau is brilliant, as are all the actors. Dom DeLuise appears as one of the techs at the US Air Defense HQ; this is the only \\"serious\\" role I've seen DeLuise play. <br /> <br />This film goes further than the mere \\"technology runs wild\\" theme; it brings up the frightening questions, \\"What's REALLY going on up there (or ANYwhere)?\\" and \\"What can REALLY happen??\\" <br /> <br />I recommend this film one-hundred-per-cent.

0792844890|4.0|Laugh out loud movie. This has to be one of Mel Brooks best, it is a knock off of Star Wars but done with Hillarity and respect. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a sence of humor and 2 hours they need to do something with...
B000AARKOO|1.0|I was ready to love this film but was bitterly disappointed. For one thing, a man did not just decide to become a knight at age 18. He had to begin training when he was three years old. Chivalry was a way of life, not a career. The sets were very authentic but if they had stuck more with the real story it would have been magnificent.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The best movie collection to date. Anyone who does not like this movie or can't respect it needs to never buy another DvD because it doesn't get better than this. These movies were truly made with taste and style that can't or won't ever be seen again. This is a great movie if you are looking to expand your collection or if you are uncertain what to get that husband or father in your life that says he doesn't want anything for his birthday AGAIN. To some folks it might seem like a slow movie but if you just sit back and pay attention rather than wishing something would just blow up every 10 seconds you would truly understand these movies and know why it is as great as everyone says.

1401302378|5.0|Now that people can find more niche products, the market of niches is huge. \\"The Long Tail\\" offers a fascinating glimpse of how technology could make mass markets smaller while niche markets expand.<br /><br />How did we get here? Online music services and Internet bookstores, with their infinite virtual shelf space, can stock every product. Brick-and-mortar shops, with scarce space, must concentrate on hits. So it's no mystery why certain Long Tail businesses - like digital music - have taken off. It's a lot more tempting to choose from 3 million songs at iTunes starting at 99 cents, compared to choosing from 60,000 tracks at Wal-Mart starting at $12.<br /><br />The question is, does this lead to more aggregate sales, or merely a shift from the head of the tail (the hits) to the Long Tail (the niches)? Are Internet retailers creating new demand, or simply taking share from old brick-and-mortar businesses?<br /><br />\\"The Long Tail\\" does show how niche opportunities are popping up everywhere because the Internet has enabled low-cost (or no-cost) reach into those markets. According to Anderson, software-driven recommendations - like Amazon's book suggestions or Netflix's movie recommendations -- rival word-of-mouth:<br /><br />\\"Recommendations have all the demand-generation power of advertising, but at virtually no cost. If Netflix suggests a film to you based on what it knows about your taste and what others thought of that film, it can be more influential than a generic billboard aimed at the broadest possible audience.\\"<br /><br />The main ideas in \\"The Long Tail\\" have been around for years, but Anderson puts it all into context beautifully. But he overreaches by implying that Long Tail economics applies everywhere. The discussion of digital music is convincing. No doubt, iPods and downloading has driven the Long Tail in music. The reasons are obvious: people prefer portable songs for 99 cents instead of paying $18 for a CD with one or two good songs.<br /><br />But digital music is different from other products. Downloading a song for 99 cents is an impulse entertainment purchase. Does the Long Tail apply to books equally? Will students buy more textbooks simply because more titles are available? Will fiction readers buy more mysteries and discover new authors simply because a recommendation for them turns up on Amazon?<br /><br />Anderson declares blockbuster economics obsolete. But in the film and book worlds, the hits still rule. The Harry Potters and the Da Vinci Codes sell more every year. Isn't it ironic that \\"The Long Tail,\\" a book about the death of hits, is a monster bestseller? The Internet hasn't repealed the 80 / 20 rule yet.<br /><br />These quibbles aside, I recommend \\"The Long Tail.\\" It's the best business book I've read in the past 10 years. You might not agree with everything in it, but it will get you thinking. If you're involved with content, retailing, or advertising, it's a must-read.br /> <br />But digital music is different from other products.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I watched this hoping for another great adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and was really disappointed! What was that ending? It seemed like it came out of a REALLY bad Mills and Boone novel which my sister usually reads. All kissy-face and sickly sweet!
B000F8O2OM|5.0|There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE. There are a variety of reasons for this in each case. With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates. Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode. This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background. Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel. This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.<br /><br />Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa'uld. The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer. But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better. All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.<br /><br />The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale. Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one. The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised. Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed. STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times. My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode. If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget. I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap. Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.<br /><br />As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters. We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father. His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts. Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer. This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut. Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.<br /><br />All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen. Although I've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.pels the show into the next one.

B00004Y6TQ|5.0|For an artist like Bjork to make a soundtrack to a film in which she stars seems a little off-putting. All told, I actually saw the movie after listening to the soundtrack. I've been a Bjork fan for a while, and when this CD came out in 2000, I was shocked by how real it was, even as a soundtrack. Not all of the songs immediately made perfect sense, due to their dependence on the actual film; however, Bjork seems to always find a way to make each track uniquely hers. \\"Cvalda\\" and \\"In the Musicals\\" are musically full-bodied expressions of the musical, which for Bjork seems to always divide the real world from the one in which we always live.<br /><br />\\"I've Seen It All\\" is beautiful, in its own quiet way. This song is important, in that it embodies the duality of the film, with its many contrasts in characters and especially camera-work, which changes whenever one of the \\"musical\\" numbers starts.<br /><br />All in all, Bjork used \\"Selmasongs\\" as an album and a project to further her avant-garde intentions while not getting wholly lost in them. Each track captures some of her original verve, which only continues to strengthen with such new projects as \\"Drawing Restraint 9.\\"
0385507755|5.0|I was not able to put this book down - I was so thankful I had to sit on plane just so I could read my book. The writing is powerful. The main character is so engaging.  He's powerful but completely powerless at the same time.  The main character's self talk really lets you experience what it must feel like to recover from an addiction.  Again, the writing is powerful - I cried through parts, laughed through parts, and even at some points fell in love with the main character. <br /> <br />

I stumbled across them while surfing around the 'net and I'm thinking to myself what did I miss all these years!  This is true metal.  Great lyrics, screaming guitars & rifs and enough double bass drum to tear down the walls.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this CD.
074325144X|5.0|I read many books about running and this is the first I have encountered that seriously discusses running posture / style and the biomechanics of running from a practical viewpoint. Don't be scared by the title \\"Chi Running\\" - there is nothing supernatural about these techniques - in fact it is as natural as it can be! However, we need to re-learn HOW to run (like we did when we were kids!) - in an effortless way, free of injuries. Danny Dreyer guides you through a system where you use the core (and core muscles) in a more effective way through a forward body lean. The idea of effective body movement through the use of core muscles is also found in Terry Laughlin: \\"Total immersion\\" - a guide on swimming. <br />I won't go into more detail here - I will leave that to the author of \\"Chi Running\\"! <br /> <br />The book is filled with additional information on running, but the instruction on the running posture is what makes it so special and worth studying. I try to put the instructions into practise, step by step, and I feel it's working. My speed has improved and I am much more aware of keeping a proper technique through the races, which makes running long distances more enjoyable.  <br />The instructor in my gym (professional sport instructor) borrowed the book and started running again after a long break - now he is free from previous injuries that prevented him from running.  <br />For those of us who don't have a Chi-running instructor nearby, the video instruction is necessary. It should be included with the book.  <br />

B00097DX3U|3.0|After hearing Audioslave's first album, and knowing where the roots of each band member had originated, I can say that the band has made a fair evolution with the new album. However, I don't think its fair to say that the album is better than the first, at all. It does have some good riffs, and the lyrics are still just as profound, but their sound seems to have become more \\"radio proud,\\" if you will. In truth, if you really like the band (or even the songs they play on the radio from \\"Out of Exile\\") I would go ahead and buy the album, but I wouldn't expect the greatness that the first album produced. I guess one could say that it just wasn't as \\"fresh\\".

0596009208|5.0|I just got this book today, and after finishing the intro and chapter 1, I've gotta say that it's a great book with a unique (and working) teaching method. The beginnings of the book give you some great tips to use when reading the book in order to help the information sink in (which are great tips for reading ANY info book), and the book does its part by providing examples, puzzles, and descriptions of each topic covered. A common method the book uses pertaining to this is to provide you with a block of code with an error related to the current chapter in it, in which you have to find and correct said error.    This book is meant for people (like me) with no Java experience, but some experience in one or more server-side web (PHP, Javascript, etc.) or local programming (C++, Python, etc.) languages (HTML not included). The book revolves not only around providing information in a way that's easy to remember, but keeping that information in your brain and not letting it out even when it cries and pleas for escape. The authors use a friendly, comical, conversational method of explaining things, which is one of the methods they list to help you remember things. A quote from the book says \\"...there's no simple way to tell your brain, 'Hey brain, thank you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how little I'm registering on the emotional richter scale right now, I really do want you to keep this stuff [Java information] around.'\\"    After reading the equivalent of only two chapters of this book, I give it a solid five-star rating without a second thought.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|Prior to an opportunity to listen to Rise Against,  I'd never followed the band and I remain unfamiliar with their past work.  But with AOL option of listening before you purchase,  I decided I would listen to hear what the hardcore punk band had to offer.  The result of the listen basically revealed that not only Rise Against, but also their new album THE SUFFERER AND THE WITNESS had a lot to offer any interested listener.  To start off with, if you are a big punk fan, especially hardcore punk that has a lot of abrupt transitions in the music, tempo changes, and manic singing from the lead singer,  then Rise Against is your group and this album is highly recommended.<br /><br />The production here for the most part is well done.  Per punk, the guitars are overproduced at given moments, but that goes with the nature of the music.  The sad thing here is that as overproduced as the guitars go here, Rise Against still has nothing compared to the overproduced guitars on Nickelback's ALL THE RIGHT REASONS (cheap shot, I know).  Production of course isn't the big dysfunction of Rise Against.  At times, the lyrics become a bit to incomprehensible and makes the listener think he is listening only to loud, unfounded screaming.  At the best moments in THE SUFFERER AND THE WITNESS, the vocals are balanced with comprehensible lyrics as well as comprehensibly music.  The positive thing is that for the most part, THE SUFFERER does everything right, with only a few flaws.<br /><br />The album opens with a bang with the unique, attention-grabbing \\"Chamber the Cartridge\\".  Instantly with this initial track you here that these punks are going to take you through a ride of driving guitars, raucous drums,  whiny/eccentric/ crazy vocals, and a beaucoup of transitions (tempo, timbre, etc.).  That trend never dies on this album and keeps it fresh.  \\"Injection\\" does one better production wise than it's former track \\"Chamber the Cartridge\\" as you can actually comprehend more of the lyrics and the direction that RISE AGAINST is trying to carry the band and the listener in.  The next three tracks \\"Ready To Fall\\", \\"Bricks\\", and \\"Under The Knife\\" all impress for the most part (though they under impress slightly compared to \\"Chamber...\\" and \\"Injection\\"), but it is \\"Prayer of The Refugee\\" that raises the album to new heights, most unexpected of a punk band.  \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" features some truly \\"sick\\" guitar work, assertive background vocals supporting the lead, manic lead vocals, and abrupt switches in style, making the track unpredictable by the listener.  Keeping the momentum set, both \\"Drones\\" and \\"The Approaching Curve\\" are equally solid compared to \\"Prayer...\\" and stand among the best of the entire album.  While a few of the tracks at the end of the album fall off slightly in quality and excitement (\\"Worth Dying For\\", \\"Behind Closed Doors\\", \\"Survive\\"),  tracks \\"The Good Left Undone\\" and the even better \\"Roadside\\" keep the pace of the earliest tracks steady.<br /><br />Overall, the album is pretty tight and filler material is on the low.  It isn't without a few flaws, but they aren't enough to truly bog it down.  Perhaps this album will bring Rise Against to the forefront of the music world.  With the work shown here, they should truly be scoring platinum albums like their many contemporaries.  4 stars.lyrics and the direction that RISE AGAINST is trying to carry the band and the listener in.

Wolfmother has recorded a loud, thundering behemoth of a record that may not alter the course of modern music but at least restores a sense of joy and creativity to modern rock.

Give it a spin, as a lover of classic rock, I was impressed and you will be too.

It had to be one of the fastest books I have ever read.  <br /> <br />I liked Samantha's character and learning more about her (she's very likeable), but found the story to be a bit too simple. There wasn't enough plot or character development for my taste. Perhaps that's why I read it so quickly. We barely learned anything about Nathaniel, and we have no idea what happened to Arnold or what exactly the scandal was. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Kinsella's Shopaholic books, so I'm surprised this book came after them, because she seemed to do very well at developing her characters in the other books. <br /> <br />Overall, it's an enjoyable read.

0451209338|5.0|This book is chronologically the first in the Gabriel Allon series.     Chronological Order:   1. The Kill Artist  2. The English Assassin  3. The Confessor   4. Death in Venice  5. Prince of Fire  6. The Messenger     In this book, Gabriel, a former assassin for Israel's foreign intelligence service, the Mossad (which translates into English as \\"The Institution\\") retired after the murders of his wife and son to lead a quiet life as an art restorer, one who fixes the wounded past. Gabriel's ex-boss, Ari Shamron, an Israeli spymaster a la George Smiley but more treacherous, convinces Gabriel to leave his sheltered hermitage to hunt down Tariq, the assassin who killed Gabriel's family, before he can kill again. In an exquisitely wrought plot of treachery and counter-treachery, Silva explores the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from many, many angles.     I don't read spy fiction as a genre. I don't read anything as a genre. I read great writers, pretty much no matter what they write. I've read a lot of John Le Carre, and one of the few criticisms that I have of his work is that his spies play a gentleman's game. However, Le Carre's spies are deeply human and British.     Silva's spies are not gentlemen, and this is no gentlemen's game. This is hard and dirty intelligence work by one of the hardest and dirtiest intelligence services on the planet. The Mossad is charged with keeping tiny Israel's formidable opponents at bay, and you don't do that by playing fair. Gabriel's Mossad plays entirely unfairly, as it must, as it does in real life. In this book, Jacqueline/Sarah is used as a \\"honey trap,\\" and Silva lightly explores what it does to a woman to prostitute oneself for a good cause. Silva does exaggerate some of the Mossad's successes, which he does not need to do because the Mossad is very successful without Silva's burnishing.     Silva's plotting is as intricate as a chess game, albeit a game where each of the chess pieces has a deeply felt personality, background,and damaged psyche such that they refuse to move where the gamester wants them to and take on a life of their own. Another thing that I like about Silva's work is that, while Gabriel is the central character and our guide, each of Silva's characters has his/her own agenda and life and is capable of growing, changing direction, and surprising the reader. One feels when reading Silva's books that the book is built to elucidate several characters, not merely one central character.

B0002W18MU|4.0|Truly, what else can you say about Johnny Cash but that a legend was living amongst.  He was the country singer that could unite different people to embrace his music.  Who can deny Johnny Cash's gargantuan role in shaping country music.  That question is rhetorical as Johnny was one of the greatest if not the greatest country singer of our time.  When Johnny passed on in 2003, just like Ray Charles to R&B/jazz/blues, country music and the music world in general lost a huge innovator.  While listening to Cash's posthumously released AMERICA V: A HUNDRED HIGHWAYS, the great and surprising quality of the album is made bittersweet by its said content.  Here Johnny reflects on the things that many men, especially men nearing the end of their earthly journey reflect on:  his own death, the death of June, spirituality, God, among other deep issues.  I have no doubt upon hearing AMERICA V, that it will be a huge force to beat at the 2007 Grammys.  It is a simple album, yet it is filled with depth and poetry.<br /><br />Rick Rubin did a masterful job with the production on AMERICA V.  While the average listener may say that it is nothing extravagant or truly impressive, the task was a bit overwhelming.  Hard core Johnny fans will realize how coarse and \\"flawed\\" Cash's voices grew in his old age.  Old age weakens the voice and to make Cash actually sound strong here despite his affected voice, means Rubin deserves huge kudos.  Futher more,  Cash's vocals also were more prone to intonation problems as showcased by a track like \\"Further On Up The Road\\".  However it is those slight falters in pitch here that actually characterize Cash's voice, hence using a bad means (bad intonation) to make a phenomenal ends.  The spare arrangements here actually work very well with Cash and still allow Cash to be the hero as opposed to the arrangements themselves.  Also as a listener, once you hear Cash start to sing himself, you don't wish for any drums or any other contemporary country devices to enhance the songs.<br /><br />The songs featured on America V are all consistent.  One might argue there is not one better than the other, but I enjoyed personally \\"Help Me\\" which gives you chills as you hear Cash try to affirm to spirituality and asking God for help.  Further down the track list, \\"The Evening Train\\" deals with the dark, cold issue of death and having a loved one taking away.  Even in such a track as \\"The Evening Train\\", Johnny finds hope in singing about being in a better place.  Here the piano, fiddle, and acoustic guitar complement each other very, very well making for one of the most beautiful, touching tracks on the entire album.  \\"Love's Been Good To Me\\", uses strings, piano, and acoustic guitar for Johnny to reflect upon his love for none other than his late wife and love of his life, June Carter Cash.  Those tracks are just three of the eleven.  The foot-stomping hand clapping effects on \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" embodies black gospel, southern gospel, folk, blues, and traditional country music all in one.  \\"Like The 309\\" channels death again, but lighter than the later, more somber \\"The Evening Train\\".  \\"Further on Up The Road\\" adds a touch of organ to the arrangement, giving that exceptional tune even more character.  So much could be said about any one of the eleven tracks because they are all consistent, just as music used to be.<br /><br />No, AMERICA V is not the best Johnny Cash album, nor may it be the best album of 2006.  What it is is one of the strongest releases of 2006 and a phenomenal album to cap off a phenomenal career by Cash during his life.  What a great way to remember Cash with such a fine album as AMERICA V.  4 stars.devices to enhance the songs. <br /> <br />The songs featured on America V are all consistent.

068816689X|5.0|A very interesting story about a young Jewish woman living in Germany and Austria before during and after World War II.  She calls herself a \\"u-boat\\" because it was a nickname that the Jewish people called those Jews who were hiding in Germany during the war.  Edith Hahn grew up in Vienna but after the Nazis occupied Austria she was forced to work as a slave laborer on a farm and then in a paper factory in Germany.  When her mother was about to be sent to Poland, Edith was allowed to go back to Vienna to join her.  Edith instead decided to go into hiding after she met her mother for the last time.  She obtained false papers from a woman in the Nazi party and a friend of the Nazi woman who was in the Nazi racial department in Austria.  Shortly after she obtained her new identity she met Werner: an artist who was in the Nazi party and who managed the paint line at an aircraft factory in Brandenburg, Germany.  He fell in love with Edith and asked her to marry him.  Edith told him she could not marry him and with some prodding she told him she was Jewish.  He told her he wanted to marry her anyway and he would keep her secret. <br /> <br />This book is different from other books I have read on the holocaust and Jewish resistance during the war because it is about a Jewish woman hiding in plain site right underneath the Nazi's noses.  The author covers the fear and suffering that she went through when she was at the work camps and when she was in hiding, but she also talks about the good things that a few of the people in Vienna did for her.  Some of them were even in the Nazi party.  She also shows that she was not aware of just how bad it was in Poland and the concentration camps until late in 1944 when she heard on \\"illegal\\" radio (the BBC) that the concentration camps were actually death camps where millions of Jews were exterminated. <br /> <br />This book is very well written and keeps the reader interested.  I could not put the book down.  I highly recommend it.
0790729407|1.0|I saw this movie a few years ago & enjoyed it so I chose it for my final in a class that analyzed 'historical' movies. When I got this dvd, the main menu was non-existant [it goes straight to the movie], side B was blank & I had no special features. I was unable to see the last 10 sceens of the film or any special features b/c side B was blank.  Sure I could return it but that doesn't really solve the problem that I had a 10 page paper where I could not analyze the end of the movie.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a fascinating book and something which all children/young adults should read.  The story is one which warns against blind conformity and group thought.  A wonderful read.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Absolutely the most interesting artist of 1980/90s. The two CDs represent almost two decades of George Michael's work. Mostly the songs are ballads however there are some really unusual ones - no way to be bored listening the CDs.
B00000G3PL|5.0|This series is the most fun and entertaining set ever made.  Even my girlfriend, who always falls asleep in the first ten minutes of every movie, not only stayed up through one but watched the all four with me.  In a row. They have just become her new favorite movies. (And I thought I'd be stuck watching chick flicks forever.)

B000E1KN5W|5.0|First, a brief history. I first heard this record when it came out in 1969 and it completely blew me away with its originality and craftsmanship. I still have the first Atlantic vinyl pressing, so, needless to say, I KNOW every nuance of this recording.<br /><br />Court of The Crimson King was without question a very daring and innovative work in 1969. No one had ever heard anything quite like them. To this day, I consider it a masterpiece of modern art.<br /><br />If you love this recording as much as I do, you owe it to yourself to buy the JVC Japan re-issue. Yes, I know it costs 40 something bucks, but take my word for it; this version sounds much better then the HDCD \\"Original Master Edition\\" or the Caroline \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\".<br /><br />With all that said, keep in mind that this is a 1969 pop music recording. It has (like most records of the day) a limited dynamic frequency range compared to state of the art recordings of today. The JVC edition of King Crimson's first album is THE very best you will hear. Dim the lights, put yourself in a good pair of headphones, and take a wonderful ride. This is as good as it gets.
0679777547|2.0|I admit that there are many great characters in this book, Frida Ungern, the one-armed baroness and the protagonist himself,  that make it almost worth reading.  There are also many great moments, like the opening scene, and the arrival to Toledo,that are worthy of attention.  The book itself, however, is so deeply flawed that by the time I finished it, I felt completely cheated.  I read it in the original Spanish (I studied Spanish Literature for 6 years in graduate school), I know Latin, and yes I am a bibliophile who enjoys reading erudite fiction, which is why I forced myself to  finish this book. <br /> <br />First of all, at the beginning of the book, we as readers are forced to accept on faith the unfounded connection between the Three Musketeers and the Delamonicon.  I was never convinced that there was ever any coherent link between the two and surprise, by the end of the novel, we are told that the connection was entirely illusory... Well, I could have told you that in the first place! <br /> <br />I have read any number of Spanish \\"modern\\" novels written with all kinds of really difficult narrative experimentation  (\\"La reivindicacion de don Conde Julian\\"  for one) and only rarely have I actually read one where the experimentation failed ---  it got so complicated that it became an incomprehensible snarl.  I believe this novel to fall into that category and finally, I realized it wasn't my failure of reading but rather, Perez Reverte's failure of writing.   <br /> <br />Another thing... What's the point of this Nikon character anyway?  Some old love interest of the protagonist that gets thrown in every once in a while just to drive the reader into bored distraction.  She really seems pointless and annoying to me.   <br /> <br />And finally, what is the ending all about??? This is complete jibberish and entirely anti-climactic.  I actually sat back and laughed at this supposed climax when Varo Borja engages in his Satanic Ritual.  I know I'm criticizing the book for not being a satisfying read but it puts itself forward as a sort of a thriller-diller and should in some way conform to the genre and satisfy the reader. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0786838655|5.0|\\" 'Like it or not -- and believe me, plenty of people weren't very fond of Rome, either -- America is now the heart of the flame.  It is the great power of the West.  And so Olympus is here.  And we are here.'<br /><br />\\"It was all too much, especially the fact that I seemed to be included in Chiron's we, as if I were part of some club.<br /><br />\\" 'Who are you, Chiron?  Who...who am I?'<br /><br />Chiron smiled.  He shifted his weight as if he were going to get up and out of his wheelchair, but I knew that was impossible.  He was paralyzed from the waist down.<br /><br />\\" 'Who are you,' he mused.  'Well, that's the question we all want answered, isn't it?  But for now, we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven.  There will be new friends to meet.  And plenty of time for lessons tomorrow.  Besides, there will be s'mores at the campfire tonight, and I simply adore chocolate.' \\"<br /><br />If I were to discuss the Boy Scouts of America, there would certainly be some harsh sentiments that I'd have to express, both in regard to the national organization and, also, in regard to my own recollections of having been an adolescent member.  But among the Scouting experiences about which I have only positive memories are the couple of weeks each summer during the late Sixties that I spent at Woodworth Lake Scout Reservation in upstate New York.<br /><br />Woodworth Lake was encountered at the end of the five-hour bus trip that would always commence at the crack of dawn from the Long Island suburb where I was growing up.  Mornings at Woodworth Lake would begin with our trekking from our respective lakeside campgrounds to the dining hall where one member of each assigned table had arrived even earlier in order to set the table and serve as that day's waiter.  The days would end after dark, with all of the groups in attendance at the camp coming together in a natural amphitheater location to perform skits for one another and to join together in song.  (Thirty years later at circle time, I'd think back warmly to those campfire evenings as I taught preschoolers to sing such camp memories as \\"Waltzing Matilda,\\" \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" and \\"There's a Hole in the Bucket, Dear Liza.\\")<br /><br />In between the morning and evening festivities, I'd get to tackle projects of my choosing that would lead to merit badges, swim in the bracing cold lake, hike for miles with my buddies, and swat mosquitoes.  Woodworth Lake was where I learned to row well enough to be able to subsequently conquer the substantial winds and tides of Northport Bay and Huntington Harbor.  It was the location of contests where a Crisco-covered watermelon would be tossed into the lake between two competing camp groups, or where late-night scavenger hunts were occasionally conducted, with success leading to coupons that were redeemed for tasty midnight snacks.  And then there was that night in 1969 when we all sat together inside the canteen and stared in awe as Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.<br /><br />Sure, there were plenty of guys with whom I became friendly over those years, as a result of attending patrol and troop meetings back at home.  But there was a whole different bonding that developed between those of us who spent afternoons together, developing skits for the evening campfire, and mornings together, waking up hours away from our families and familiar living patterns.<br /><br />I'm currently sitting up in bed, hours from home, the only light coming from the laptop in my lap.  It's an hour before sunrise, and there's a freight train whistle in the distance -- something we stopped hearing in our part of the world decades ago.  Sunrise will lead me and Shari back out to the gorgeous Sierra lakes, trails, and vistas that we're experiencing this week.  Traveling hours away from home in order to wander through and over mountains is clearly one of those learned behaviors resulting from my summer camp experiences.<br /><br />Although Percy Jackson's summer camp experienceclearly shares some similarities with mine, as well as with those of most adolescents venturing away from home and habit, it would be safe to say that Percy's summer camp experience at Half-Blood Hill (beginning shortly after the incident in which he unwittingly vaporizes his pre-algebra teacher) also involves quite a few dissimilarities from the summer camp norm:<br /><br />\\"We must have been on the north shore of Long Island, because on this side of the house, the valley marched all the way up to the ocean, which glittered about a mile in the distance.

B00001OH7U|5.0|David Bowie may have been all a clutter in the mid 70's but as is the case with 'Station To Station' some brilliant music came out of it.This music is special becauses it's funky,rocking and dramatic all at the same time and flows end to end with six extremely well written tunes.The title tune really does have the feeling of an epic-part is very dramatic 'kraut rock' with spiky guitars and part is very R&B/dance oriented.\\"Golden Years\\" of course goes more in that direction-a very clinical funk tune that was deservadly a huge hit for Bowie.\\"Word On A Wing\\" and \\"Wild Is The Wind\\" are both big dramatic ballads but with far more thought put into the writing then any of the album cuts on 'Young Americans'.\\"TV-15\\" is a great rocker off of the album-well more of a pop rocker and \\"Stay\\" takes another great turn on a funkier side of town but this time with a tad of the Philly taste of yore.Big difference is that on 'Station To Station' there is a slight lack of warmth.But even though Bowiewas working his way through relationship,drug and management problems his music certainly wasn't suffering the worse for it.This is one of David Bowie's best albums and one more then worth investigating.
0618477942|5.0|I bought this two weeks ago, and have re-read it approximately six times since.  It's hilarious and elegant, brimming with brilliance, loss and wisdom.   <br /> <br />Not enough bravos can ever suffice...  <br /> <br />Also, as someone familiar with a few of the physical settings for Bechdel's work (I attended Oberlin shortly after she did), I must comment on her creepily perfect renderings of the mail room, Gay Union, library moon chairs and cinderblock dorm walls. I could smell the lake-effect snow.   <br /> <br />Thank you, Alison, for your brilliant book and making memory so tangible.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beautiful and well-written stories throughout the centuries.  It isn't meant to be viewed as a serious tale, but is instead satirical, poking fun at the different conventions of society at the time.  The heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is well-developed and extremely likeable, as is her sister, Jane.  Even Mr. Darcy, whom everyone dislikes in the beginning of the novel, is likeable in his somewhat clumsy love for Elizabeth.  The struggle that Darcy and Elizabeth go through to finally admit their love is complex and draws the reader into the story even further.  I must say that my favorite character is Mr. Bennet, because his off-the-wall humor had me laughing out loud several times throughout reading the book.  I read this book when I was 13 and thought it was wonderful, and over the years it has become even better.  This book is such a remarkable piece of literature that it only gets more interesting and more fruitful of a read the more times you actually pick the book up and read it.  Jane Austen is a master of literature.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've found this album sincerely moving. I can't dispute the fact that Mr. Cash here sings a few times out of tune, but it's not in any way that would cause a listener to wince, so much as be moved. It's difficult not to place these interpretations in perspective -- the voice is clearly that of an old man who'd lived through ordeals. Most of the songs are covers of songs which I've never really appreciated until hearing this CD. For instance, I never appreciated the talent of John Lennon's early music as I did when I heard Johnny Cash sing \\"In My Life\\" and realized this song, written by a twenty-something, was better suited for the 70 yr. old Cash. \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" is given added poignancy when one realizes the song seems dedicated to recall his earliest memories of his recently deceased wife. And \\"Personal Jesus\\" generates a good idea into a deeper message.    My favorite track, though, is \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" -- I never realized how good a song this is. Sorry, Art -- although the original version sounds pretty, Cash's interpretation gives new meaning to \\"when you're weary.\\" Basically, Cash's interpretation brings the song to new depths of feeling for which his take on the lyrics capably bring to life. This track  actually has been MY bridge over troubled water for the last week or so. Other reviewers seem to have mixed feelings of Fiona Apple's contribution here, but, for me, her contribution isn't so much a duet with Cash as the \\"Silver Girl\\" herself providing angelic background vocal to oversee the safe passage across rough seas.    Overall, the first few listens of the CD caused me to wonder whether the second half lives up to the first. The best songs for me seem to be grouped up in a bunch. Over time, though, I gained a new appreciation for \\"Streets Of Laredo,\\" and now rank it along with the favorites I've already mentioned. It seems to provide the perfect ending to an album that begins with the one Cash original of the set: the compelling title track. Whereas \\"The Man Comes Around\\" speaks of divine justice, \\"Streets Of Laredo\\" speaks of redemption. I only hope Mr. Cash has safely crossed to whatever destination his life had led him, and if there indeed is any divine justice, that destination would rightly be blessed.
0060989157|5.0|This book is like a train wreck that you cannot look away from!  I did not want it to end. It is a frightening and fabulous voyeuristic look into the heavy metal music scene of the 80's, which is surprisingly well written (particularly the Nikki Sixx chapters). A must read for fans and non-fans alike!
0385292244|5.0|So much has already been said about this novel, so I won't go into detail except to add that I was impressed by the display of female power in the medieval Japanese court, whether real or imagined by the author. Female Shogunate warriors, cunning sexual influence and unexpected bravery really helped to shape the novel, especially towards the end. This is a novel with alot of depth, detail, and tons of characters to keep track of, but it's thoroughly impressive and a worthwhile read.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Steven Spielberg once again makes a thrilling and capable film. He is the ultimate master of timing and suspense; he never forgets the audience's need for a good story.    I regret, though, that I watched his introduction to the film (one of the options on the DVD) before viewing the film itself. He is bending over backwards to explain that this is not a political movie (i.e., no message here that could be construed as anti-Israel, anti-war). But really, I'm sorry, that's disingenuous, for this is obviously an anti-war movie. You only need to focus on the final frame, an endlessly long shot of the World Trade Center in New York, to appreciate this fact fully. Clearly, Spielberg has had a stomach full of violence in the name of peace and has made a protest film, the message of which is that killing breeds only more of the same and degrades the humanity of those recruited in its cause, however idealistic and decent they start out.    I think I would have admired the film more if I hadn't watched its director retract its obvious message beforehand. That he felt the need to do so simply underscores how tormented and fraught the current political situation has become.    Munich is also obviously a double-entendre, since it is both the birthplace of Hitler and the site of the terrorist attacks on the Israeli Olympic athletes. How much longer will the human race need to endure such evil cycles of violence? This is the sad question this dark and powerful film asks. Unfortunately, its maker has neither answers nor the courage of his own convictions.
1878424505|5.0|I read this book when it first came out. I read it about once every 6 months.  It is an wonderful book on personal freedom and ancient wisdom.  Each time I read it, it speaks to me in ways that are always changing--as my life is changing.  If you read it and don't get it--please try again with an open mind. I really recommend it to anyone who cares about personal growth.

B000053VAZ|5.0|This is a story about stagnant sibling relationships. Benny (a mechanic) has structured his entire life around 'protecting' his mentally ill sister, Joon. Both are dissatisfied: she in particular has withdrawn from society and broader human interaction, and has an underdeveloped ability to care for herself. The ensuing frustration manifests itself in pyromania.  <br /> <br />His need for control and her isolation are tearing their relationship apart, despite the very real and visible love they have for each other. Sam is a much-needed catalyst for change. I suspect that his appeal for Joon, who is immediately drawn to him, lies in the fact that he makes absolutely no assumptions about her on the basis of her condition.  <br /> <br />It has been said that this movie is arguing that love conquers all, but I disagree. Romantic love is presented as a mechanism of change and renewal: but the real story lies in a brother's struggle to overcome his own need to protect his sister from society, and in his blindness when it comes to her own requirements as an adult woman. The viewers and Sam himself are made to confront the very real facts of Joon's illness when their attempt to abscond results in a highly traumatic episode. <br /> <br />Essentially, the movie is a humorous and emotional one. While not the most polished movie you'll ever see, 'Benny and Joon' comes across as very sincere, and it isn't afraid to tackle the tough issues. Johnny Depp is as lovely as always, and the film contains moments of incredible wit, warmth, and a quirky kind of humor in its portrait a mentally ill young woman who has absolutely normal needs when it comes to love, sex, and independence.  <br /> <br />And it's nicely gritty, too, and highly effective.
B00005JP0A|5.0|Meryl Streep is absolutely hilarious playing Miranda Priestly, the editor of the world famous fashion magazine \\"Runway\\". Along comes Andrea (Andi) Sachs for a job interview. She recently graduated from Northwestern University as a journalism major. Emily, the first assistant to Miranda, nearly snickers in Andrea's face as she looks her up and down and makes snobbish critical remarks about her unfashionable ordinairy clothes. Everyone in the office is calm, casual, and laid back until they learn Miranda Priestly is returning to the office when they go into \\"high alert\\".<br /><br />The grand entrance by Miranda is superb, her haughty but elegant manner is perfect, with one breath and in one single sentence she rattles off six or seven commands to her assisant. Everyone jumps to attention and gets into action ... Andrea's interview is nearly cut short when Miranda notes she lacks the fashion background Miranda is looking for. However Miranda is won over by Andi's sincere work ethic and despite misgivings hires her. As second assistant, Andi manages to pull off miracle after miracle to make things happen for Miranda. It is when she does the impossible: obtains a publisher's copy of the latest Harry Potter book for Miranda's twin daughters that Andi's star at Runway begins to rise but at a huge cost to her personal life. Through a series of most auspicious but unexpected events, it is Andi who goes to the spring Paris fashion show with Miranda and a very select group of Runway staff. In Paris Andi comes to terms with her own values and resolves some personal struggles about her job and what she wants from life ...<br /><br />The film is a parody about the serious competition which exists in the fashion and magazine publishing industries. The tensions, dramas, and back-stabbing are clearly evident. Dealing with the stresses and strains associated with trying to separate one's personal and professional life is very difficult. It becomes clear, the price of success means favoring work over family and friends .

0385512104|1.0|I don't know how many times you are allowed to use the *F* word in R-rated movies, but it is used at least every 5 pages in one form or another in this book.  The Lord's name is taken in vain in every other 5 pages.  Oh, yeah, the *C* word is slipped in, but just only once; but that was enough to make my blood boil.  I haven't heard that word used in over 25 years.  I pre-read this book, because it was on the Upper School Choice Book List for a Christian School that my son will be attending this Fall, before handing it over to my son to read.  Needless to say the book will be returned to the bookstore and another one will be chosen off the list.  Now if my son goes to this school and uses the language that permeates this book, he can be expelled.  I'm not into book banning or burning.  Everyone can read what they like, but I think that there should be a rating system for books, just like there is for movies and video games.   Based on all the reviews that I read for this book, I was suprised that the language factor was never mentioned.  This should be rated R or M for Mature readers only.
B00008BXJG|1.0|I hate AC/DC. They are in my top 15 worst bands of all time and I wish to destroy and kill both of their singers, Brian Johnson and Bon Scott who just scream. They aren't anything like nice singers like Foreigners' Lou Gramm, and Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler at all. They are just 2 minded idiots who are on drugs <br />AND CAN'T SING. Buy this if you are a looser but good bands are <br />Dire Straits, Foreigner, GNR, Nirvana, and Green Day who rock! <br />Don't ever buy this album, destroy it today in your trash can. <br />Buy albums from good bands that I mentioned here. <br /> <br />PS. Bon Scott is just angry so don't ever buy this.
6305161879|5.0|True to form, the cast of characters in this film deliver a hilarious performance.  A great 'pick-me-up' when you need to be entertained. <br /> <br />John, Jamie, and Kevin play very well off of each other.  I would love to see them do something together again.
B000FA57RG|3.0|Since this is really a two disc set, featuring a live album and DVD documentary, I'll give my thoughts on each seperately.<br /><br />First, the live album:<br /><br />Madonna's stage shows are so visually spectacular, depending so much on costumes, choreography and video, that the very idea of her releasing a live album with just the music is a little odd. Not that her music isn't great. But a lot of the high energy dance numbers (\\"Music\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Die Another Day\\") leave her voice sounding winded or grainy, or electronically distort it so much that it sounds unhuman. Only on the somber \\"Lament\\" does her voice really shine. The best track on the CD is, ironically, the final track, which is not a live track at all, but an alternate rock version of \\"I Love New York\\", from her newest \\"Confessions\\" album. The song sounds so much better as a stripped down rock tune that it makes me wish Madonna had released the rock album she was rumored to be working on.<br /><br />Now the film:<br /><br />The film portion is really less a documentary than it is a feature-length commercial for Madonna. Not that it's not, at times, entertaining. But it's far too controlled, edited and polished to offer any true, revealing, raw insight. Even the live performance clips are so hyper-edited that they really look more like music videos. To make a real documentary about this legendary pop icon, Madonna would have had to surrender her privacy and image to a gifted auteur with a vision of his own ... and our girl is just way too much of a control freak to ever let that happen.<br /><br />Overall, this package is probably worth owning for any die-hard Madonna fan, but will probably not be very interesting for anyone else.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|hmm...this album is by far the worst album ever produced by A.F.I...it was sorely disapointing for me, having really liked \\"The art of drowning\\" \\"Black sails in the sunset\\" i even liked sing the sorrow, but turning completely emo? wtf... the only recent song i liked by them wasnt even on the cd \\"Rabbits are roadkill on route 37\\"  and is it just me or does MISS MURDER sound exactly like greendays HOLIDAY? i guess A.F.I was looking only to go mainstream, theys sure as hell did it..
B0007P3582|4.0|The Massacre featured solid tracks that were different from what u heard on Get Rich or Die Tryin. 50 chose to bring out a sort of different route not the same things you are used to hearing from the previous LP. The majority of the tracks are enjoyable, and are supposed to be listened to the entire track not a few seconds sample. The majority of the negative feedback either from haters down with the GAME(G-UNOT CAMPAIGN), or those that feel it should censored! If you don't beleive my review you can read the review of the Massacre on the Rolling Stone Magazine website which gave it a 4-5 and named the LP in the years top 10 albums of 2005 from the link below!

Wish there had been more about the natives included.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I thought the documentury was very interesting. I always thought of Madonna as a Mean Diva. But really she just honest and so loving. She has a big heart. Seeing all those live footage of the songs was amazing. I have never seen her live, ever. She can put on a show. And the girl can sing. I can't stop listening to the CD which is in fact her first LIVE ALBUM. My favorites on this is VOUGE, MUSIC, NOBODY KNOWS ME, LIKE A PRAYER, and the Live Version of MOTHER AND FATHER is soooooo much better then the one on the American Life album she gives it more meaning and sings it with more vocal then i have heard in a long while. And who doesn't Love to hear HOLIDAY, and the beats were so much heavier on this track it just makes you want to dance and sing along. Madonna has been around for so long now and she deserves more.. Her 2 kids are so CUTE!!!! and Guy is a loving husband but kinda young for his age..LOL And Madonna really gives credits to the Dancers to helping her give a good no make that a great show. This CD and DVD collection is so unique and it's worth your need of entertainment.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|This film, which cross-pollinates the psychological suspense thriller with the traditional ghost story, is not so much scary as disturbing. The plot, in brief:  Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) has separated from her husband. The two of them are involved in a tense custody battle for their daughter, five-year-old Ceci (Ariel Gade).  Forced to cut expenses to the bone, Dahlia finds a tawdry ninth floor apartment in a rent-controlled, dilapidated building on gloomy Roosevelt Island just off Manhattan. Strange events begin to occur, involving a mysterious backpack Ceci finds on the roof, whispers at night, noises from the abandoned apartment one floor above--and a leak in her front-room ceiling that keeps coming back. While Dahlia struggles to balance the demands of a new job with those of her estranged husband which now include the need to find an attorney, she has nightmares, battles migraines, and pleads with an apathetic landlord and his creepy maintenance man to fix her ceiling before it caves in. Her daughter, meanwhile, has found an \\"imaginary playmate\\" named Natasha--a name the girl couldn't possibly have invented and who, gradually, takes on a frightening reality as walls of \\"dark water\\" steadily close in on the two of them.  <br /> <br />Director Walter Salles and his team did a superb job increasing the believability of this story's supernatural elements by easing us first into a gritty background of New York realism. Doubtless many of us have dealt with landlords who were backslappers, assuring us this would be done and that would be taken care of, and then lose interest once your name is on the dotted line (and we don't even live in New York!). And there are plenty of employees more interested in their pensions or adhering to union policy than getting a job done. Or they \\"don't want to get involved.\\" Nothing in Dahlia's new building works right. The elevators also leak; they malfunction; the washing machines don't work. These expected features of dilapidated buildings provide a seamless transition to the story's supernatural elements.  Another atmospheric soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks, Arlington Road) quietly enhances the all-pervasive sense of claustrophobia.  <br /> <br />The effects are superb from start to finish.  Water permeates everything.  Dripping water, puddling water, brackish standing water, dirty water spurting from nasty-rusty faucets and out of sinks, not to mention pouring down the walls in one of Dahlia's nightmares. Add to this the constant rain in scene after scene. Because there is so much variety, the use of water never seems overdone, and is balanced by plenty of other effective techniques. Among the best of these is the distinctly uncomfortable metallic whine and heart-like thumping that accompanies Dahlia's migraines--very suggestive of what the character is going through. The camera work is quite good as well. I don't believe I've seen a ceiling leak's POV before.  <br /> <br />The acting, finally, is brilliant.  Jennifer Connelly is at her best in a difficult role--and has anyone noticed how young Ariel Gade (perhaps better known to some viewers as Rose, from last year's TV series Invasion) is turning into one of the finest child actresses around? Her performance here exhibits a level of professionalism far in advance of her years (she was born in 1997!). The dynamic between her and Connelly is nearly perfect!  Their lines never seem clever or overly melodramatic, but pack just the right emotional punch--you can actually feel Dahlia's rising alarm when, courtesy of her \\"imaginary playmate,\\" Ceci knows things she can't possibly know--especially Dahlia's having been abused and rejected by her alcoholic mother. That scene sent chills down my spine. The supporting roles--by John C. Reilly as Murray the backslapping resident manager, Pete Postlethwaite as the creepy Veeck, Tim Roth as Dahlia's lawyer, Dougray Scott as her estranged husband Kyle--and finally, Camryn Manheim (Boston Legal) as Ceci's schoolteacher, mostly do what their various scenes need them to do. The only thing I found bothersome was that Dahlia's lawyer clearly lied to her about getting back to his family in the movies--not advancing the plot and making us wonder for no reason, as it turned out, whether Dahlia can trust him.  <br /> <br />In sum: Dark Water is all shifting moods and claustrophobic ambience. There's no gore, and not that much action. To my mind this sort of character-driven narrative is much more unsettling than creatures shambling around in the dark or even maniacs bearing long knives. The creatures obviously aren't real, and (most of the time) neither are the maniacs in their hockey masks. What scares us is what the ghostly antagonist represents. The \\"monster\\" in this film is a little girl who was abandoned by her parents in a ghastly mistake. Children do get abandoned in the real world. Separations and divorces do happen--all the time. People do end up struggling to survive, often under horrid living conditions, compelled to deal with others' indifference. I don't recommend this for children, and only hesitatingly recommend it for parents of children undergoing difficult separations and divorces. You know who you are. I give it five stars, though. It is a well told, brilliantly-realized bit of storytelling, with an ending that supplies a real jolt (no spoilers!). Dark Water compelled me to take a walk afterwards, and that's usually the way I measure the success of a film like this. Fortunately it wasn't raining.

0375423877|5.0|I absolutely love this book. Alexander McCall Smith is long overdue - he is such a change from the usual fictional writers who are out there today. Mma Ramotswe is such a great character for starters. She is kind and intelligent, and a very far cry from the more typical mystery detectives. She takes her time, and often solves cases with pure logic and common sense. It's a relief to read a book about honest, normal people, and a relief to discover that a mystery novel can be written without anybody being murdered and can still be interesting. The setting itself makes the stories astounding. Smith can describe Africa and show you there is more than third-world countries and poverty. Read this and see that not every country in Africa is riddled with war and hatred. And that not every African is uneducated and poor. Smith shows the beauty and the ugliness, and leaves me at least wanting to read more.
1594200823|4.0|This book is a well written account of the 'State of the Union' as it applies to the agricultural industry in the US. I highly recommend this book but I want to mention one unresolved point that has been bothering me. The author states that three fifths of the worlds population would not be able to survive without the use of chemical fertilizer which are created by 'fixing' nitrogen. Then he goes on to laud the biodiverse, yet nearly closed loop at Polyface farm as the model for Farming. So is his point that the other 3/5ths of the worlds population will have to die off to return to sustainable limits?  <br /> <br />Cultural traditions in China have optimized the production of rice, but they still needed to augment traditional methods with chemical fertilizers to feed the population. The bottom line is that the world has exceeded it's carrying capacity and overburdened the natural resources available on this planet. Yes technoology has allowed us to exceed that limit temporarily, but we have only pushed back the threshold.
B000E41MS6|5.0|This is the best collection of DVDs that I've ever purchased.  The quality is excellent, the packaging is very well designed, the episodes are WONDERFUL and form a great, 13-episode story arch.  So well done, it's a shame that Eccleston didn't stick around.  Russell T. Davies is my new pin-up!  From Queer as Folk to Doctor Who....he's my new idol.
0345349571|4.0|Tuchman's book presents a thourough, redable account of the fourteent century and its major events (the Black Death and the start of the Hundred Years' War, for starters). While a few of the details of medieval life included in the book have inevitably been superceded by more recent research, this is more than made up for by the book's many strong points.<br /><br />Tuchman's prose is clear and far from textbook-like, but without seeming to make a point of it, and her decision to follow the life of one of the more important participants in many of the century's numerous wars/battles/etc. unifies the narration much more than would be possible otherwise. She also draws enough comparisons to more recent history (many from the two World Wars) to explain how and why events unfolded.<br /><br />Given the book's length (it took me several weeks to read, despite reading over lunch and a good-sized commute) I can't really recommend it to someone who really wants to know about particular events of the 1300s. Many good books have been written about both the Hundred Years' War and Black Death. But if you're looking for a history of the century as a whole, rather than just the plague or the war, this is a good book.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|As an avid FFVII player & fan, I could easily dribble 5000 words on the beautiful animation and incredible fight sequences.  However, most (if not in all probability all) of those who have never even heard of Cloud and Sephiroth are going to have trouble following along.  I really wanted my girlfriend to watch it with me so I took about 40 minutes to prep her for what she finally understood to be the sequel to the game (this was extremely tough considering the game can easily take about 99 hours of thorough playing to finish).  And alas!, even with the summary and endless answering to a barrage of questions like \\"What is mako?\\", \\"What is Jenova?\\", \\"Sephiroth's will?\\", she still didn't quite understand what the movie was about.  In the end, my desperate and equally futile attempt in proving her time wasn't wasted sounded something like, \\"Well the fighting was cool wasn't it?\\".<br /><br />My own personal disappointment was that the English dialogue differed so greatly from the Japanese version.  While neither were great in and of themselves, the Japanese dialogue was superior to the cheesier and sometimes dorky English version.  (The only improvement, in my opinion, in the Japanese to English voiceover was the actor who spoke for Vincent. Good voice for dark character.)<br /><br />All in all, this is a movie exclusively for FFVII aficionados (like me), CGI fans, and anyone who really appreciates excellent fantasy fight sequences--and for good reason, the creators didn't attempt to pander to any other target audience.<br /><br />Conclusion.  If you fit one of the people groups above, have at it.  Otherwise, sidestep what you probably couldn't appreciate.

1565117808|5.0|For me, the best books are those that leave much up to the interpretation of their readers. Authors have difficulty pulling this off, mainly because publishers (at least I believe it's the publishers and/or editors at these houses) enjoy stories that spell out every last detail, leaving nothing to the imaginations of the reading population. Sometimes--rarely--a book comes along that is not only told well, with memorable characters and a compelling story, but it also allows debate once you've finished it. Such is The Life of Pi.<br /><br />Yann Martel (author) gives us this gem that starts out slow and picks up speed until the very end, where the debate as to \\"what really happened to Pi\\" begins.<br /><br />We're introduced to the narrator, Piscine Molitor Patel, in his hometown of Pondicherry, India. Surrounded by animals at this father's zoo, we learn the creatures that inhabit this place are an integral part of Pi. Also integral to Pi's life is his belief in God, but Pi \\"attracts religions like a dog attracts fleas\\" and he finds himself a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu on the same day (much to the dismay of his parents). It is his faith in God that will help pull Pi through the most trying event in his life: surviving on a lifeboat for 227 days. But I'm jumping ahead.<br /><br />The book is part and parcel told by a writer who's trying to get Pi's story out of him but having great difficulty. This unknown author visits Pi at his home in Canada where our story begins and ends. Pi's life is one of rarity and hardship overcome by internal strength. And it is this story that underlies the telling of Pi's young life.<br /><br />When Pi's father decides to sell the zoo and transport his family across the sea to Canada (in search of a better life), the boat they are on sinks. Pi is the only survivor. Strike that. Pi is the only human survivor. When he plops into a lifeboat, he quickly discovers that he has an orangutang, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker accompanying him. As animal nature would have it, though, the lifeboats occupants are quickly whittled down to Richard Parker and Pi (it's noteworthy to mention this isn't some anthropomorphic cartoon story where animals talk and are friendly to humans). Having been closely associated with animals in his father's zoo, Pi takes on the challenge of training Richard Parker, teaching the man-eater which side of the boat is his and which is Pi's. An understanding develops and the tiger and boy live together on the boat for months and months, surviving each other as much as famine, thirst, sharks, and storms.<br /><br />Once the boat lands (in Mexico), Richard Parker summarily takes off and is never heard from again. Pi is rescued by beachcombers and sent to a hospital. Here he meets up with two Japanese officials, employees of the company that own the sunken ship. Questions arise and disbelief is confronted. How could a boy survive on a lifeboat with a carnivorous tiger for over seven months? The Japanese men ask for another story, one that \\"doesn't involve animals\\" and it is here that readers have to make up their own minds. Did it happen the way Pi said it did the first time? Or is this ending version the true story? I'm not going to give away what this is; suffice to say it is compelling and intriguing and will probably blow your mind.<br /><br />This novel certainly ranks up there with my favorite reads in the past few years. I'm sure I'll read it again ...and again ...and again, just to see which story of Pi's I truly believe.amed Richard Parker accompanying him.

B0000C9JFO|4.0|A great fun, creative film!  A very light hearted look at modern coming of age as exchange students learn that there are no rules when studying abroad.  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll punctuate some more dramatic themes such as love, fidelity, loyalty and betrayal.  Throw 6 students studying in Barcelona from 6 different countries together in an apartment and see what unfolds!  Clever filming and and camera motion as well as a bohemian undertone make this a very enjoyable film.
B000B19BCG|4.0|This band, once identified with by sullen, but not-too-serious, young stoners, made some really fun, and often rather frivolous music.  Like many such groups, it risked the danger of becoming passe and running out of ideas very quickly -- or so I once thought. After turning on to their music through this latest CD, I've actually backtracked to their older stuff, much of which I admit I had only encountered before, in passing, as a music seller at Borders. Back then (late '90's) I did own a CD, which I taped a few songs from and then sold. I especially like the song \\"Grace,\\" which is on the CD, SUPERGRASS IS 10 (Best Of), which I purchased AFTER hearing ROAD TO ROUEN. The music on this new effort, I'm happy to say, is the kind of work that could only be produced by musicians who have grown up some.  It's adult, cogent, melodic and subtle.  ROAD TO ROUEN does have some energy, even playfulness here and there, while it reveals a group that is relaxing and mellowing. Upon revisiting their older stuff, I can see why Supergrass have a loyal following. I hope they can keep it!  \\"St. Petersburg\\" is catchy, and my favorite here, and the last two songs, \\"Low C\\" and \\"Fin\\" make an excellent, stirring finish.  This album may be short, but it's sweet.
B00000JJQK|5.0|To the reviewer \\"mrkite\\": To say that all the songs besides \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" on Pet Sounds are fluff is rediculous. This album is amazing. Sgt. Pepper's is great and all, but it sure as hell doesn't make me feel the way Pet Sounds does. You should really evaluate the way you listen to music. The way Brian Wilson got those sounds amazes me. He Really is a genius, and if people can't see why, then God help us all. Also, people should really stop comparing The Beatles and The Beach Boys. They made Rock and Roll music. That's about all they have in common. They're totally different to me. But back to Pet Sounds. As soon as you put it on, you're launched into another galaxy when you hear that deliberately out of tune 12-string guitar riff to kick-off \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\". And every other track is just another stop to another planet in that galaxy, until your landing (unfortunately) is welcomed by those dogs barking and that earthshaking train whistle. Oh yes.. It is quite the album. My personal favorite of all time.
B00000JXVK|5.0|When this movie was being shot in 1970, I was an active District 36 MX racer in Northern California.  The word went out that there was this movie that the makers would like to have reviewed by some real racers.  So many of us convened at the old Sacramento Memorial Auditorium for a private showing of the film.  We then were asked to rate it.  (I was surprised, but not that surprised to see a guy who had been a temporary guest at our house in the Steve McQueen MX section, leading Mr. McQueen - (the one with the tire marks on the yellow jersey whose initials are JH))!  So we all gave it our approval and the rest is history.  Later, at the 1971 Saddleback Park InterAm, (or Trans AMA by then) the filmakers took a parade lap in a dune buggy before the race started - in silence.  I was there for that too.  30 plus years later, I saw the film again and thought that it was a little condescending to everything but professional AMA racing, poking a lot of fun at the grassroots - sportsman riders.  But regardless of that, this film represents a historical document when MX was quickly becoming a popular race form in the U.S. It is good to have it as it is, but it would have been even better if more personalities of the day had been included rather than focusing on a handful of favorites.  (I always liked Steve McQueen, but he was not a champion racer ever).  But I don't wish to look back into a gift-horses mouth, we are fortunate to have ANY film from that period - and a sort of arbitrary McQueen document also exists because of this film.  (Note, the end sand sequence was shot at Pismo Beach, CA).
B000EOTAM6|1.0|This movie was a waste of time, effort, and money.  It was so god-awful that I was amazed (not in a good 'B-movie' or Troma pictures way, either).  The only positive I can offer is the star is attractive, the graphics were interesting, and some of the intriguing core elements of the cartoon came up briefly.<br /><br />I am a fan of the Aeon Flux cartoon, cartoons in general, and I'm a huge scifi fan.  Go buy a good film & save your money & time -- here's a bunch I'd recommend: 'Hardware', 'Strange Days', 'Blade Runner', 'Silent Running', 'They Live', 'Donnie Darko', 'Time Bandits', 'The City of Lost Children', 'A Boy & His Dog', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', 'The Hidden', 'Solaris', 'Gattaca', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Altered States', or even 'Alien'.<br /><br />This film could have been done well, but was not.  There were some shots where even the lighting was bad.  Getting basic lighting done right is not rocket science or art, it's just basic production.  Production value, along w/a good script and good editing, is what this film LACKED.<br /><br />Regardless of how bad of a 'smeller' this movie was, it DID inspire me to go out and make movies!  I mean, if someone can get paid to make a P.O.S. like this, I will be making $$$ hand over fist!!!<br /><br />(threewaysmedia.com)
B000FGGE68|3.0|When Kurt Wimmer wrote and directed \\"Equilibrium,\\" he managed to make a wonderful, lower-budget sci-fi flick that had a great story, plenty of action, and solid performances from actors such as the wonderful Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, and Emily Watson.  When Wimmer cranked out \\"Ultraviolet,\\" he was given a larger budget, an established action star in Milla Jovovich, and a really creepy kid who is perfect at playing a creepy kid (Cameron Bright).  So what does he do with these seemingly win-win elements?  He goes heavy, VERY heavy, on the action, heavy on the CGI, and tosses the actual acting performances to the wayside.<br /><br />Jovovich, Bright, and underrated character actor William Fichtner (also of \\"Equilibrium\\"), have absolutely nothing to work with in this story.  The reed-thin plot is based around Violet (Jovovich), a hemophage who's out to capture a weapon that can supposedly eliminate her kind on Earth.  It seems that every disease in the universe has been wiped out except for one that makes its victims look and act like vampires.  After capturing the weapon, however, Violet begins to question the motives of both her allies and her enemies and all of it sort of smashes along at breakneck speed until there is no one left to kill on the screen.<br /><br />This film wreaks of echoes of \\"Equilibrium.\\"  From the armed soldiers who explode into powdery shards to the clean white uniforms worn by Violet and others in the flick, it seems as if Wimmer took what he felt were the coolest parts of his cult hit and threw it into this film hoping to cash in on it once again.  Even the gun-kata is tossed in!<br /><br />Visually, this is like a video game gone awry.  There's enough eye candy here to send you into fits.

0790732254|5.0|Liz and Dick were definitely at the top of their game when they stared in this movie.  Although I wonder how much of it was actually acting???Their performances were Oscar worthy, no doubt.Even at a few pounds overweight for her frame, Ms. Taylor was still a raving beauty.  Cream always rising to the top.The additional commentary by the cinamatographer on the DVD edition is most appreciated and enlightening.  The special features are always a bonus on any classic film.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I was born in 1976, so I spent most of my developmental years in the wonderful 80's.  Although I was still a bit young when \\"Superman-The Movie\\" hit the big screen, I caught up with him through VHS and television.  Plenty have donned the red cape, from George Reeves to Dean Cain and everyone in between.  Brandon Routh, who I have yet to see in the latest film, is the current hero of the day.  Christopher Reeve was, is, and always will be Superman to me.  I don't care how hokey the special effects look in this particular flick or how bad the third and fourth films were, Reeve is the Man of Steel in my opinion.<br /><br />This film gives us the origination story of Kal-El, son of Jor-El, of the planet known as Krypton.  If you've been around for a few years, you probably know the rest of the story, so I'll skip that and just stick with the performances of the actors and actresses.  I've gloated on Reeve enough, but I have to admit that his bungling, country-tinged Clark Kent is perfect.  He does a complete 180 degree turn when he rips open his business suit and that \\"S\\" bursts onto the scene.  Lois Lane is done with sassy flair by the great Margot Kidder.  She, much like Reeve, has become her character in my mind.  Gene Hackman hams it up as Superman's arch enemy, Lex Luthor.  His over-the-top performance is fun to watch on the screen.  Ned Beatty portrays the bumbling sidekick, Otis, and Valerie Perrine is a scene stealer as the luscious Eve.  Marlon Brando is sufficient as Kent's father, but his performance comes across as rather wooden.  Terence Stamp (General Zod), Jack O'Halloran (Non), and Maria Schell (Vond-Ah) have sinister small roles in this feature, but set the stage well for \\"Superman II.\\"  The rest of the cast, primarily reduced to supporting roles, do a wonderful job with what they have to work with.<br /><br />As stated before, the special effects are pretty hokey by today's standards, but they were top-notch in 1978.  They help move the story along at a decent pace without hindering the performers on the screen.<br /><br />This film set a high standard for future comic book-based films.  While many have met, and in some cases surpassed, this standard, \\"Superman\\" will always be considered the first of the great modern comic flicks.<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of comic flicks, or anyone who just wants to relive the excitement of seeing ol' Superman fly for the first time!at a decent pace without hindering the performers on the screen. <br /> <br />This film set a high standard for future comic book-based films.

B00005JOQS|5.0|Like the citizens of Metropolis, I didn't realize how much I missed the Man of Steel until I once again witnessed Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) running down Main Street, shedding his clothes and setting sail to save the day for the first time in Bryan Singer's big, beautiful, fast paced, masculine yet very touching take on the Superman franchise, \\"Superman Returns.\\"<br />Routh's Kent/Superman, a superb creation of director Bryan Singer (\\"Usual Suspects,\\" \\"XMen\\"), Dan Harris (\\"Imaginary Heroes) and others, is as usual naïve, befuddled and endearing as Kent but this Superman, along with being strong, upstanding, driven and sure of himself, is also very emotional and human...a mensch: outwardly a product of the love bestowed upon him by his adoring adopted mother (Eva Marie Saint) and his girlfriend Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth).<br />Much of \\"SR\\" is jaw-droppingly gorgeous thanks to the superior work of Production Designer Guy Dyas and the visuals of Newton Thomas Sigel (\\"Three Kings,\\" \\"Brothers Grimm\\"). In fact the first rescue sequence involving an aborted launch of a space shuttle with Lois on hand is truly amazing both in physical execution and emotional impact. Also of note is the way in which Superman levitates throughout the film: on the one hand almost balletic in movement on the other very much akin to the mechanical movement of a heliocopter.<br />\\"Superman Returns\\" and I for one am glad he's back.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I don't think I have ever taken the trouble to review anything before, but I feel compelled to promote the talents of Sufjan Stevens. The Copland-like rhythms, the feeling of open spaces, the broad range of subjects and ideas and the memorable melodies urge me to listen to this CD over and over again.  I never tire of it.  I believe his \\"Michigan\\" album reveals itself as a predecessor of \\"Come Hear the Illinois!\\" in the melodic schemes, but they mature into an incomparable album here.  Also look for Sufjan's \\"Seven Swans\\" which has strong and haunting mystical, Christian and just lovely imagery in it, as well as tunes to return to repeatedly.  My two favorites.  I look forward to the next album!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|For me, this is by far the best Red Hot Chili Peppers album and I doubt they can release something as good as this in the future, now that is how I feel about it, you might not. <br /> <br />As some other reviews say, this album is full of ballads and slow songs... yes that is true, even though there are a few songs that are more like the old chili peppers, most are ballads, but what is wrong with that? songs in here don't ROCK! they are just great to listen to, this is an awesome album to HEAR, not to ROCK to and head bang. <br /> <br />If you like to sing you will find a lot of songs here which are great to sing along to, I was gonna write down which ones they are but there are just too many. <br /> <br />Some of the songs on this album remind me of BSSM but mixed with some of the best ballads and harmonious singing they have ever made, if you think you would like that combination then you will love this album, but you wont find a BSSM part 2. <br /> <br />So if you are still linking Chili Peppers to \\"Give it Away\\" and \\"Freaky Style\\" you will be seriously dissapointed, but if you enjoyed \\"Californication\\", \\"I Could Have Lied\\" \\"My Friends\\" then you will love this. (I hope) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, was off the hizzy!  This was the funniest and most intriguing murder non-mystery I've seen in a long long time.<br /><br />Here's a non-sequiter:  Who the hell is Shane Black? How does Amazon come up with the  name of the \\"star\\" to put under the title of the movie?  I don't know what movie they saw, but the one I saw starred Robert Downey, Jr, and Val Kilmar. This movie was sort of like a roller coaster.  It was full of funny and scarry ups and downs.  It really was very interesting.<br /><br />I loved how the director mixed humor with scariness.  It was a blast to watch.<br /><br />It could have had more bonus features, but I'm glad to see a commentary from Robert Downey, Jr and Val Kilmar.  Very nice.<br /><br />Great flick!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Wow...it's a good story that has to be followed closely, no getting up and leaving the room or you'll not understand where it's going..i liked this one, it was different, made you think..i'm not real crazy about ashton kutcher but as an actor in this movie he was good in the title role. If you like a really good story that's not the over-rated boy gets girl, lives happily ever after plot theme which permeates most movies these days, you'll appreciate this one.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Many friends and I have purchased all the SongBook series. We love them. We are senior citizens and long for the nostalgia and the type of dancing Rods CD's are giving us. Notice other musicians are coping Rod's idea. However, Rod's versions and arrangements are the best. Especially for our aging ears. Having said that I have also tried, in vain, to get the message to Rod that 48 slow Fox Trots are enough. Give us some swing and Latin arrangements, PLEASE!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|OK firstly,I am a huge chili peppers fan and own pretty much all the music etc. they have ever released.I think this album is overall a brilliant album.But there are just a few issues about it I would like to address. <br /> <br />1.I think that if the chili's (I know they already had to narrow it down)took only the best maybey the absolute 17 songs off this and made a single release of those best songs, this would have been an absolute masterpiece and would cancel out ant hint of ordinary quality songs.(only problem is the all band members and rick rubin would have different opiions about the truly best 17 or whatever.)but what's done is done.Its still great! <br /> <br />2.SNOW(HEY OH)Ya it's everyone's favorite but in my opinion they kinda ruined in a way in some bits.OK the guitar riff is pure magic,the verses are pure genius, especially when the strings enter(so beautiful)then it goes into that part 'the more I see...'thats like a pre chorus and also very cool.BUT THEN the song tragically turns mediocre when the next part comes in...''deep beneath the cover...'you know the bit.I think this is the chorus and is to my ears, dare i say it?annoying(I just hate the drums and even the vocals there.there is no melody and the rythym is just annoying.after this 'chorus'which is repeated, I think the song goes on for too long and I think the outro is only OK.Sorry but I just feel strongly about that. <br /> <br />3.I also bought 2 versions of the Dani California single and on one b-side there is the song'million miles of water'This is an absolutely beautiful song with an amazing chorus,really really brilliant. YOU TOO SHOULD BUY IT!I don't understand how it did not make the album as its way better than AT LEAST seven or eight songs on the album. <br /> <br />SO FINALLY,Ill get down to what I think of the album's songs.I'd like to first point out that I really treasure great 'flowing' melodies in songs (that aren't cliche) <br /> <br />THE GREAT <br />1Dani California 2.Snow(just about great ,if ya read what I said)3. Charlie 4.Hump de bump(kind of on the good/great borderline)5.She's only eighteen 6.torture me 7.especially in michigan8.c'mon grl 9.wet sand 10.tell me baby 11.hard to concentrate 12.make you feel better 13.so much I 14.storm in a teacup 15.turn it again(just cos of Frusciante's outro solo)16.death of a martian(just gets there)17.slow cheetah (just gets there) <br /> <br />GOOD <br />1.stadium arcadium ( highly overated in my opinion)2.strip my mind 3. warlocks(nearly great) 4.hey 5.desecration smile 6.readymade <br /> <br />MEDIOCRE <br />1.21st century 2.she looks to me 3.if 4.animal bar 5.we believe. <br />(million miles of water is better than nearly all of these 'good' and 'mediocre'songs') <br /> <br />Overall album rating 8.5/10.......or 9.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Album is good, but \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" is a Violent Femmes cover, they can't write a song this great.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|I will start this off by saying that I haven't listened to the entire album yet. This is more of a review of some reviewers that artificially inflate the ratings. <br /> <br />How can people sit on amazon and give every track a score between 9 and 10? Realistically, is it possible for this (or any) album to be that good? I like the RHCP, but I don't know why some people think that anyone can take their review seriously if the entire album is rated so highly (every track). Maybe an album is generally considered one of the best in history, but I know many would not like every track so much that they would give it 9 and above throughout. <br /> <br />Even though I haven't listened to the entire album, I gave it 3 stars since I had to give it a score.
B000005HFH|5.0|excellent performances by chet baker. his voice is unique and is highly recommended to all jazz lovers. It is so rare to find so many songs by chet baker in one collection and here are some wonderful songsby a wonderful jaxx singer and player.
B000E41MS6|2.0|The show itself is fantastic ... as the new Doctor would put it. I recommend it with 5 stars no problem. However. $64.00 for a set of 13 episodes on DVD is insanely expensive. I feel like such a set should go no more than $38 at the max. I don't care what the special features the price is way too much. If you have a recorder ... it would be cheaper to just record them from off Sci-Fi network, and live with that. The BBC is obviously selling only to a niche market with a price like this. I love Doctor Who, and I love this new series, but if all I can do is watch it on Sci-Fi and online ... then so be it at this price.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|*<br /><br />First of all, I am NOT what anyone would consider a \\"STAR WARS\\" fan, so, somewhat understandably, I did not get TOO irritated with your \\"Special Edition\\" revamping -- although I never quite warmed up to your addition of a very CGI-looking \\"Jabba the Hutt\\" (which you could have simply requested to have digitized to look more \\"animatronic\\" like the puppet model used in \\"Return of the Jedi\\").

B000AADYRQ|4.0|This is a good album: plain and simple. It has every aspect that is so loved from other Death Cab efforts; the songs are good and Ben Gibbard's vocals are as brilliant as ever.  But this album lacks the flow of Transatlanticism or the solid sound of The Photo Album.  The tracks(even the weaker ones) are good for the most part (I am not a fan of \\"Summer Skin\\") but there are the obvious \\"better\\" tracks and the others seem to cower in the wake of the \\"I Will Follow You into the Dark\\"s and the \\"Soul Meets Body\\"s and are there to fill the gaps between them. <br /> <br />This is a good album, however. Very few moments are anywhere near bad and most are very good.  But the imagination of some of the earlier works seems to be lacking somewhat and the album as a whole will grow staler quicker than Death Cab's earlier efforts.      <br /> <br />I truly believe that if this were from any other group it would be worthy of a 5 star rating; DCfC's past works are just so strong that a 3 1/2 - 4 star rating is deserved and even generous.  I am not kidding or lying when I say this is a good album; it is. But it is just not outstanding. Death Cab seems to be just biding some time until their next effort comes along to hopefully pull us back in.
B00005JO20|3.0|We all know the story - big ape is KO'd by big apple.  But Hollywood can do special effects - that's one of its few strengths - so every generation of film makers needs a chance to show off their updated software skills. Hence, King Kong 2005 is a natural, super-sized with all the special effects that were a real challenge to make credible in the earlier versions. And this new one has been PETA-sized, with an added component: not only can a giant dark ape fall in love with a beautiful blond white woman, but a beautiful blond white woman can fall in love with a giant dark ape. A marriage made in - well, Skull Island. Hence, the underlying imperialist theme is dulled a little (but only a little), and we're left with a 3-hour homage to achronological monsters, animal rights, and the true nature of love. Standing over the defeated Kong's limp, crushed body just toppled from the great monument to civilization, Jack Black (stupidly) concludes: beauty killed the beast. So you have nothing to fear from this film.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Genre: The Interpreter, The X-Files, CBS 60 MINUTES (Darfur stories), owning a rental period of customer patronage I think shall suffice this analysis h'yar...<br /><br />In group psychology, the element of primacy is essential to maintain control of group role play and dominance.  Films about Africa are of characteristically foreign, anglo, English speaking affluence to American and world audiences.  What this tell us is that what we can gather from the Bush administration's not only lack of any domestic conception other than price fix and gouge gasoline prices, expropriate the budget for corporate expeditions and so forth, their is no foreign diplomacy tolerated from America regarding Africa.  Likewise America is not to enter into bilateral recognition of North Korea other than to perhaps recommend a safe and optimally media placed stunt with inadequate rocketry, as Rice no doubt also recommended sub rosa agreements to Iran to take a defiant stance after her whirlwind tour of backward bridge under the card table.<br /><br />Then again, any higher thinking on the matter might be appreciated more along the lines of moronic American crime television, the title itself: The Constant Gardener, might be found loaded with overt suggestion of latent homosexuality, like: The constant hairdresser...The consummate quiche recipe...The constant fashion monitor...or The constant showtune collector.<br /><br />One thing's for sure though, American's superiors are in control of all the panic and chaos abroad.  And to make that all the more clear to American audiences, a seat has been reserved for British accent on every television no-talent contest; their presence and its eminent associativity (neurolingual programming being extremely provocative to human intelligence in many forms it takes) is foisted on us quite peculiarly unless we take into account these other factors at work in mass entertainment media that dramatize and misinform the picture of goings on in the larger world.  And always, always, as is true of every American tv programming week's killing and crime spree indoctrination, stiff coercion must be applied, coercion to suggest that fearless manipulator (rather than constant gardener) will just trapse around killing anybody it wants, or even anybody it want to silence.<br /><br />Well the other day I was considering the more deliberate course for Senator Hatch's flag burning bill to have been constructed in prohibition for burning not the American flag, but rather the more offensive one, the British \\"Union Jack\\".  I mean Mr. Hatch is the constant salesman and does always arm-twist the power of suggestion Americans burn their own flag, obviously because it's the safer one to burn for all he cares.<br /><br />The movie looks at scenes something similar to the genocide in Darfur.  60 MINUTES showed everyone the satellite image of all the pinpoint laser guided munitions craters, which everyone knows was so well demonstrated in the First Gulf War, and that would require a rather sophisticated aircraft also complained about by those people (and reported by 60 MINUTES), a plane attacking at night under the cover of darkness so as not to be photographed for any misbehaviors it might implicate.  Perhaps arms sales of stealth bombers to some foreign entity?<br /><br />The AIDS epidemeology and medical response has drawn question in America as well, it looks to many people like a feeding frenzy for drug manufacturers rather than methodical anti-viral immunological approach.  I think we can talk about that can't we...without some creep in a bowler turning up around the corner with his poison umbrella...hopefully as charming, and yes...masculine...petty...petty little tyrannist gardeners...and for that, I shall force you to read American scripture:<br /><br />\\"I have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my secret opinion has ever been, and still is, that God Almighty will not give up a people to military destructions, or leave them unsupportedly to perish, who have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent.

Or the wheat gluten food alergy epidemic, or the now expanded definition of dyslexia to include illiteracy and failed memory epidemic..running in whole families.  What on earth sort of mystery have we here?<br /><br />Mac Haddon's book is funny, there are diagrams, and it does try to be entertaining.  He's part of an elite writer's workshop located somewhere out on the bog with all those upper crustaceans.

Americans as a commoner class are required a system of enunciating their place beneath those types and characteristics in the English speaking world who are `more equal'.  They've been trying desperately to frame the superstition autistics are `more equal' on the public for some time now, it's the Rain man formula for proxy disassociation with the autism epidemic and its now narrowed down list of possible scientific causes: fluoridation.<br /><br />I think that British Fluoridation Society may be tucked away among those writer's getaways among Britain's upper crustaceans.  Of course they are pro-flluoropoisoning, and would obviously have that `constant gardner's' interest in a good herbicide for Their garden.<br /><br />The book hasn't sold well at Hastings, so I had to own a copy.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects. <br /> <br />One star.  <br />

B00005NQLP|4.0|The 1977 \\"CSN\\" album had been a smash hit for Crosby, Stills & Nash.  In typical fashion, the guys just couldn't get their heads together for a follow-up, not least due to Crosby's descent into \\"drug madness\\" (as Nash puts it), which also did away with a reuniting of the Crosby * Nash duo team.  So, Nash decided to carry on with a solo record, his third, with \\"Earth & Sky\\" coming out in early 1980.    Basically, this album sounds exactly like you would expect.  It's a soft rock album all the way, totally sounding like it was recorded in 1979 or '80--a booming drum sound, chorused rhythm guitars, tinkling electric pianos, etc.  If you're a sucker for that kind of sound (and I don't fault you if you are!), you'll really like this album.      No, it's not a masterpiece.  \\"Skychild\\" and \\"Helicopter Song\\" are forgettable, and the ballad \\"Magical Child\\" is okay but suffers from sickly sweetness.      It's often great though.  The title track has that trademark lilting Graham Nash melodicism (it features instantly recognizable slide guitar from Joe Walsh).  \\"Love Has Come\\" is a wonderful soft-rock ballad.  The waltzing \\"It's All Right\\" is another soft-rock ballad, similar in theme to \\"Love Has Come\\", and it's a little cheesy and brought down by toothless female vocals toward the end, but it's still very pleasant.  The starkly-arranged, yet dreamy, minor-keyed \\"Out On The Island\\" is simply blissful; and heard today, it curiously seems to foreshadow the title track for David Gilmour's \\"On An Island\\", the latter of which Nash even sings background vocals on!  The anthemic \\"Barrel Of Pain (Half-Life)\\", another in a large stack of late '70s songs written about the dangers of nuclear waste, is quite powerful.  And the rousing, quick-paced album-closer \\"In The 80's\\" is infectiously upbeat, optimistic, and catchy.    All in all, this is not quite as well-written as 1971's \\"Songs For Beginners\\", nor is it as insanely catchy as 1986's \\"Innocent Eyes\\", but \\"Earth & Sky\\" is still highly worthwhile.      However, I recommend you steer clear of the Magic Records CD release of \\"Earth & Sky\\"; providing you have a quality turntable, you'd almost undoubtedly be better off with the original vinyl.  I've gotten a couple of other CD reissues from Magic, and they each have incredibly cruddy remastering, clearly done from either vinyl or cassette copies--may the buyer beware.
034544678X|3.0|Patricia McConnell's book is a good read for dog lovers/owners, but it's an amalgamation of training tips, anthropologic observations, science of evolution, and personal anecdotes.  If you are looking for a training guide to use in working with your dog, read this because it's interesting, but you'll still need a training manual.
B000002I6X|4.0|Much has been made about 1971's \\"Stephen Stills 2\\" being a major disappointment that suffers from egregious overproduction.  Yes, this is a clear dropoff in quality from Stills' first solo album from 1970, but not a HUGE dropoff.  Even with its flaws, this is still a solid effort.    \\"Nothin' To Do But Today\\" is a super fun, laidback country-blues rocker.  The droning folk tune \\"Know You Got To Run\\" is captivating and hypnotic, with revealing lyrics reportedly written about Neil Young (and partially recycled from \\"Everybody I Love You\\").  \\"Singin' Call\\" is a soothing acoustic ballad.  \\"Marianne\\" is an irresistible, swinging pop-rocker graced by Stephen's excellent falsetto vocals.  \\"Fishes And Scorpions\\" starts off ultra-dreamy, with its intertwining layers of reverb-laden guitar and Stephen's smooth vocals, and it works up to a fiery guitar solo.  \\"Relaxing Town\\" rocks, although it has a sadly anti-climactic sudden ending.  \\"Sugar Babe\\", extremely similar to the previous album's \\"Church (Part of Someone)\\", is well-written and effective in its own right, although marred by the excessive fuzz bass/ guitar.      In all likelihood, the most well-known/ well-remembered song from the album is the album-opener \\"Change Partners\\"--it's a nicely-melodic country pop-rocker, but it's a little overcooked, with disjointed shifts from the 3/4 verses to the 4/4 chorus.  \\"Marianne\\", like \\"Change Partners\\", also reached the top 50 of the US Billboard Singles chart.  But probably the second most well-known song here is the Dylan-esque \\"Word Game\\", which is a mixed bag--blatantly structured like \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\", Stephen resorts to misguided sloppy rambling, despite his excellent, moody acoustic guitar backing.    Speaking of misguided...  For whatever reason, Stills seems to have taken fancy to Chicago--the band that is--as evident by the three horn-soaked numbers \\"Open Secret\\", \\"Ecology Song\\", and \\"Bluebird Revisited\\", and considering Chicago's incredible lameness up to that time (in large part anyway, the classic \\"Beginnings\\" notwithstanding), this is a damn shame indeed.  The horn arrangement on \\"Ecology Song\\" is laughably schlocky and obnoxious, sounding EXACTLY like late '60s/ early '70s Chicago, plus it's got an awful song-ending trumpet/ flugelhorn solo.  The extended, conga-heavy instrumental coda on \\"Open Secret\\" is again unmistakeably reminiscent of contemporaneous Chicago; however, the main song portion of it is excellently-written and even moving, and thankfully doesn't suffer TOO badly from horn excess.    Stephen Stills was a real ambitious dude back in the early '70s, and although his ambitions didn't serve him as well on \\"Stephen Stills 2\\" as they had on its predecessor, this is still a strong collection with Stills' enormous talent very much in evidence.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|This is one of the worst shows we've ever seen and that's saying a lot.  It's on a par with Peter Ustinov playing Charlie Chan, 30, or more, years ago.  That movie was funny where it shouldn't have been and sad where it was supposed to be funny.  Gosh, it was bad--did anyone see us leaving the theater?  This version of Northanger Abbey is every bit as bad or worse. <br /> <br />Lately, my wife and I have been going over Jane Austen DVD's and videotapes we've acquired or made.  Included were DVD's we'd rate as follows: \\"Persuasion,\\" 4 stars; \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the 1979, BBC production, 5 stars; the 1995 A&E production of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" 5+ stars; and \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" 5 stars.  Then, we saw \\"Emma,\\" another A&E production we videotaped from the mid-90's and found it charming and entertaining.  \\"Emma\\" might be considered lighter fare than P&P and S&S, but it's still very good, 4+ stars. <br /> <br />So we kept looking for more Jane Austen and found \\"Northanger Abbey,\\" something we'd taped off A&E and never had time to watch.  In short, this 1986 production bears no comparison with the others mentioned and would warrant less than 1 star, if we could give it. <br /> <br />When we saw that Robert Hardy was featured in this production of \\"Northanger Abbey,\\" we felt encouraged that it should be good.  We admired his work in the long-running BBC series, \\"All Creatures Great and Small.\\"  More so, he was great in his portrayal of Winston Churchill in another BBC series, \\"The Wilderness Years.\\"  But in Northanger he is poor, at best.  His character struts around in a red coat most of the time, making snide remarks.  He and the other characters are all without redeeming features and we couldn't care less what happened to them in the end.  They were either foppish or self-important, or just ridiculous. <br /> <br />As to the female lead, Catherine Schlesinger, we had to throw up our hands, lest our dinner.  Just a short time into the show we could see how miscast she was for the part and how poorly the director had handled her.  She's all bug-eyes-and-mouth open, at the drop of a hat.  One had to wonder if there were cue cards being flashed behind the camera: Bug Eyes; Open Mouth.  It was very irritating. <br /> <br />Background music was weird and very poor.  It sounded like saxophones and synthesizer--a recipe for disaster.  If the music were playing while the director and screenwriter were doing their work it might explain why the story was so disjointed and chaotic. <br /> <br />Lessons learned from the time wasted on this dreadful piece include the fact that the BBC doesn't automatically mean high quality.  Similarly, a Jane Austen adaptation doesn't always mean a good, coherent story.  Then, if you're planning to pay good money for a DVD, check the reviews posted on Amazon.com, before buying. If we'd paid for the DVD, we'd be really peeved.  Giles Foster was the director of Northanger and we'll be watching out for him in future.  Same for the screenwriter, Maggie Wadey. <br /> <br />We've read what others have to say about \\"Northanger Abbey\\" and have no interest in reading the book or seeing a re-make.  In essence, we've heard that Jane Austen intended this piece to be a satire on gothic novels of her time.  But there's no satire here.  The screenwriter and director seem to have taken the story line straight and totally lost the point.  Although we'd agree that Jane Austen could never have intended for the story to be so messed up, we don't want to be reminded of what it was like to endure this tripe. Nevertheless, we did get a few laughs reading the Amazon reviews after viewing the show.  Many were brutal and deservedly so.

0006547745|5.0|I found this to be one of William Dalrymple's most philosophical works. As always, Dalrymple's work is peppered with vignettes of lovable characters. The interplay between the past and the present impels one to ask a lot of questions. I must admit some sections of the book did make me a little depressed , especially reading about the pogroms in Turkey, bitterness in Lebanon and hatred in Jerusalem.  Perhaps the desert fathers were all, in some way,looking for a way to find a solution to such madness. Any reader who seeks to understand roots of conflicts should undertake this pilgrimage.
B00005R23Z|2.0|Absolutely a thought provoking, entertaining film. Excellent  <br />production values. Wonderful acting. <br /> <br />The green cover DVD is pan and scan (1.33).

0451191153|5.0|I started reading this book at the suggestion of a friend, and I couldn't put it down. The first 100 pages or so are kind of slow by modern standards, but after those 100 pages I was completely and definitively hooked. I think that what most attracted me to the book was the author's belief in the beauty and triumph of the true human spirit. I was born in a communist country and later raised in a climate of uncertainty that directly resulted from the mind-numbing policies of the \\"red plague\\" as I call it; I think this must be at least part of the reason why Ayn Rand's book resonated so deeply within me. Her viewpoint is quite extreme, so don't expect to agree with everything-you won't! Her message, though, stands beyond any disagreements I or anybody else might have. This book truly inspired me to give it my best, to be true to myself, and to never stop believing in my abilities . Also, I have come to appreciate the beauty of selfishness as Ayn Rand defines it. Selfishness, in her world, is living your life for yourself and eliminating the need to live in order to receive others' approval. In short, this is a great introduction to Ayn Rand's body of work as it lays the foundation for the later books including Atlas Shrugged.
B00000DFSK|4.0|Unless you're a wealthy person, you don't have the luxury to buy the entire catalog of every artist you become remotely interested in. That's what makes Best Ofs or Greatest Hits so convenient. You can start off with one album that represents the artist's best work, and if you don't like it, it only took you a few dollars and one album to find out. Not much skin off your t-i-t. If you find you really really love it, then you can continue on with their studio albums. It's smart and practical. You're only investing the big bucks into those who are worth it. <br /> <br />This is the process from which I fell in love with U2: I started off with their 90-00 set, then this, then The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop, and War. <br /> <br />As far as the 80-90 set, it is geared towards casual fans, not hardcore fans, who should already have the material. The only major complaint I have about the collection is the fluff towards the end from the Rattle and Hum album. Desire is essential: When Love Comes to Town and Angel of Harlem are not.

Both Some Other Stuff and Evolution are easily among Blue Note's most special LPs. As per the RVG vs. McMaster deal, this stuff would sound fresh on your Fisher Price.

B00000JR29|5.0|Tears For Fears followed their hit debut THE HURTING with this album, 1985's SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR.  At first glance, it appears to be just another pop album from the 1980s, but after one listen, it's clear that SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR is anything but.  It's a collection of brilliant songs spawned from the angst and inner turmoil of bass guitarist/vocalist Curt Smith, guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Roland Orzabal, keyboardist Ian Stanley, and drummer Manny Elias.  Together, the songs form a masterpiece that is not only one of the best albums of the decade - it's one of the greatest albums ever made.  It spawned two Number 1 hits: the powerful, razor-sharp \\"Shout\\", and \\"Everbody Wants To Rule The World\\", a song which perfectly encapsulates the mood of the 1980s.  There's plenty more greats here, though, such as the atmospheric \\"Mothers Talk\\" and the glimmering \\"Head Over Heels\\" (recently featured in Richard Kelly's cult hit film DONNIE DARKO).  The apocalyptic \\"The Working Hour\\" is another gem, which features a great saxophone part played by Mel Collins and William Gregory.  SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR is an album which truly is like no other.  Don't let its commercial success fool you; from \\"Shout\\" to the ethereal \\"Listen\\" - complete with heavenly vocals - this is art, fueled by powerful lyrics and a turbulent, emotional sound.    TRACK HIGHLIGHTS: Shout, The Working Hour, Everybody Wants To Rule The World, Mothers Talk, Head Over Heels/Broken [Live], Listen
B00005JOQS|4.0|This latest Superman film is entertaining. In it, Superman returns to Earth after a five-year absence (he was searching space for Krypton) to find the planet plagued by crime, Lex Luthor released from jail, and Lois Lane married with a child. Superman struggles with readjusting to things while Luthor crafts a plot to create himself new real estate (despite the damage it will do to the real estate already existing). <br /> <br />A decent film. Kevin Spacey is wonderful as Lex Luthor, as expected. Bosworth, however, disappoints a little as Lois Lane--she was, perhaps, too soft; Lois needs to be tougher and have a little bit more of an edge. Parker Posey has a wonderful little role as Luthor's moll--she stands out (in a good way). While the action scenes are exciting, there is a lot of time in-between them. While I didn't have much of a problem with it, most everyone in my party said that the film was \\"too slow\\" after we watched. Perhaps the best surprise of the film was the opening credit sequence: it is a throwback to the original 80s credits, including reusing John Williams' magnificent score. Good choice; it would've been mighty hard to top it--one of the best scores in movie history. <br /> <br />The worst thing I have to say about Superman Returns is that it is, perhaps, not the movie it could've been. Other recent superhero films have established that there's great potential left in them. While Superman Returns is good, and fun, it does not fully engage that potential save for small moments and characters, most notably Spacey's Luthor. Still, whatever the critics say, this is an entertaining film you're likely to enjoy.  <br /> <br />Four stars.
B00064WSNW|5.0|If you listen with your ears and mind open, that is.  I swear, anyone who has ANYTHING even slightly uncomplementary to say about this album has wax in their ears, is mentally off, or a combination of the two.  Everything about this album is perfect from the amazing guitar interplay of Fripp, Belew, and Levin to the provocative, deft, and meaningful lyrics of Belew.  The album starts off with a lazy, dissonant vamp that quickly evolves into hyperkinetic proportions and there is no getting off of this ride after that point.  \\"Talk, it's only talk,\\" Belew starts, going into an alphabetical catalog of different kinds of talk: \\"dialogue, duologue, dissension, declamation, double-talk, double-talk,\\" he intones as he and the band weave a hypnotic electric/electronic soundscape.  Everything is firing so well here that drummer nonpareil Bill Bruford manages to make electronic drums stunning, of all things.  The only other drummer I can think of to do this is jazz giant Jack DeJohnette.<br /><br />Man, I could write my dissertation on this album.  But if I do that, I'll never write my real dissertation.  So the skinny on the rest.  \\"Frame by Frame\\": \\"in your eyes, in your eyes, analysis,\\" Belew's central lyric here, pretty well sums it up.  In other words, you can't completely sum this song up, as well any of the others here; they do what Flannery O'Connor said good fiction should: it defies paraphrase.  You sit there and marvel at the infinite web Fripp and Co. have created, more limitless than any that Fripp & Co. wove on any album before or since, as another reviewer here (along with Fripp) suggests.<br /><br />\\"Frame by Frame\\" continues the angular contours set out in \\"Elephant Talk,\\" but these let out on the unabashedly lyrical \\"Matte Kudasai.\\"  On display here are Belew's loving lyrics that surge and swell like the real thing, somehow managing never to be sentimental or hackneyed (\\"a miracle\\"!), a trait that he, unlike any other Crimso vocalist, in my opinion, had never fully possessed before him.  This stunning vocal and lyrical performance is backed by an appropriately surging and swooping instrumental performance.<br /><br />Next is the song that hooked me for life when I was fourteen and has never ceased to entertain vigorously in the hundreds of times I have listened to it in the two decades since.  \\"Indiscipline\\" is, in short, a postmodern paranoid masterpiece, certainly no less than \\"21st Century Schizoid Man.\\"  Belew shares a monologue about an object he is obsessed with (\\"the more I look at it, the more I like it,/ I do think it's good [. . .] no matter how I take it apart/ It remains consistent\\"); alas, we never find out exactly what it is (\\"I wish you were here to see it,\\" Belew snorts).  We are led to surmise that this object is his consciousness, making this song perhaps the most successful musical conception of the Beckettian Unnamable (or Cartesian cogito) that there has ever been.<br /><br />Aaaahhhhh . . . and then \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet.\\"  A swelling sung intro that leads into a tape recording of an interview with a young man who went into a \\"dangerous place.\\"  The instruments snarl and are strummed frenetically like in the previous song, creating a sort of pre-industrial thrum; again, completely appropriate to the paranoid inner-city setting of the piece.  The moods fluctuate unpredictably and deftly here, from a tribal sort of collective expression in the sung portions to an insular feel in the found-sound sections.<br /><br />\\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is a meditative instrumental piece that highlights Frippertronics and the emerging world music influence on what I am going to call post-prog (think about it, this isn't the prog of \\"Court of the Crimson King\\" or ELP's \\"Karn Evil 9\\"; this is prog with new wave and punk influences [more of the rough stuff!!!] , world music: in other words it has moved past prog's original parameters--largely classical- and jazz-inspired--and along with and into history . . .).  Bruford'srestrained percussion here is also noteworthy.<br /><br />The CD ends with \\"Discipline,\\" another instrumental piece, bringing the whole transcendent ordeal full circle with mind-reeling mathematical patterns that tame the shrieking excesses of the songs constellated around \\"Indiscipline.\\"  No band does math rock as effectively, provocatively, and intellectually as this.  Hell, they move you emotionally as they do it, something few other technically-oriented bands can do.  It's due to Belew's lyrical genius, in contradistinction to less successful Crimso leaders of yore, and how that translates into each and every band member's playing.<br /><br />In short, buy this now.  If you've yet to hear this, you have a lifetime of shivers up and down your spine to catch up on.

B000BNX3AU|3.0|There are a couple of reasons why the movie \\"Must Love Dogs\\" appealed to me.   The first reason is that I like movies that don't have the big \\"megastar\\" in it.     I like to give a movie a chance on its merit as opposed to its star power.     The second reason is - yes, I like Romantic Comedies.   This may seem odd coming from a thirtysomething male, but yes I happen to be a fan of the romantic comedy.    Therefore with two ingredients getting a thumbs-up in my book, I figured the movie \\"Must Love Dogs\\" was one worth checking.   Overall, I thought the movie was good - but unfortunately the movie does fall short in some areas and therefore cannot be considered one of the great romantic comedies of recent years. <br /> <br />The focus of the movie revolves around a preschool teacher Sarah Nolan (played by Diane Lane).  Sarah has recently been divorced and is looking to get back into the dating game and find \\"Mr. Right\\".   At the same time, her sisters are also looking to help Sarah find the right guy.    Sarah's sister Carol (played by Elizabeth Perkins) puts her profile on an internet dating service.   After a series of failures, Sarah manages to meet up with a romantic boat builder named Jake Anderson (played by John Cusack).   Jake is in a similar situation to Sarah in that he is recently divorced and has his best friend Charlie prodding at him to get back in the dating game.   At the same time, Sarah meets Bob Connor (played by Delmot Mulroney) - the father of one of her students.   The dynamics between Sarah and these two men are really what will ignite the storyline.   Sarah definitely sees some \\"potential\\" with Jake, but also sees a connection with Bob.    Eventually things will come to a head between Sarah, Jake, and Bob - and as a result Sarah's life will be more complicated than ever. <br /> <br />The strong point of this movie is the performance of Sarah by Diane Lane.   Lane is one of those actresses who has done a steady body of work for about 20 years, yet still seems to have superstardom allude her.   The character of Sarah was one that was both \\"peppy\\" and reserved.    Lane seemed to nail this character down and fit the character's role like a glove.   It is Lane that is going to provide some of the film's most humorous moments - particularly the parts when she is engaging in the internet dating service.    I've read a lot of reviews that said that it is going to be her character that is quickly going to be the film's main force.   I couldn't agree more with those reviews.   I'm not sure that even the \\"big name\\" romantic comedy actresses (like Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts, Renee Zellweger, and Sandra Bullock) could have pulled off this role as well as Lane. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the leading actor of this film John Cusack does nothing for me.    I think blame could be shared between Cusack and the film's writers and producers.   Despite the fact that Cusack also has had a steady body of work, I can't say I have been very impressed with John Cusack's body of work.   On top of that, the role of Jake Anderson isn't very exciting or interesting.    While Cusack gets stuck with a lackluster character like Jake, Cusack does little to elevate the character of Jake. <br /> <br />There are two other characters of note in this movie - one positive and one negative.   On the positive end, Christopher Plummer delivers a nice performance as Sarah's father Bill.    Bill is a widower who is also exploring the dating game.  He provides a gentle, but strong presence in the film.    Plummer reminds me a lot of a modern day Cesar Romero in his style to acting - and his performance in this film clearly solidifies this.   On the negative end, Stockard Channing plays Dolly - one of Bill's girlfriends.   Channing plays a 61 year old woman in this movie (which happened to be her age in the movie).    Unfortunately, I found the character of Dolly to be annoying.   While I'm not the biggest Channing fan, she is given a character thatreally isn't the \\"scene stealer\\" that this character had the potential to be.   Thus I must say the character of Dolly is negative. <br /> <br />The opening credits feature some \\"interviews\\" that help set the stage for the theme of the movie (looking for love).   It is worth noting that one of the people interviewed is a character - Vinnie from Brooklyn.  This character is played by Steven R. Schirippa (a.k.a Bobby \\"Bacala\\" from \\"The Sopranos\\").   Schirippa is perfect for this role.    There is also a series of \\"interviews\\" in the closing credits that feature some of the cast members.   The style for all of these interviews was seen in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".   They work as well in \\"Must Love Dogs\\" as they did in that movie. <br /> <br />Romantic comedies are tough movies to pull off because usually there is a lot of predictability - especially in the endings.    The components of a good romantic comedy will interweave storylines and often have a subplot or two going on.  How good those interweaved storylines or subplots are will usually determine how good the romantic comedy is.  \\"Must Have Dogs\\" is predictable and has a predictable ending. While \\"Must Have Dogs\\" has Lane's presence and some funny moments, it lacks these components to help overcome the predictability. <br /> <br />Overall, this movie can best be summed up as a good romantic comedy.   There have been better ones - there have been worse ones.  Still I think this one is worth checking out - if not for Diane Lane's performance alone.  While I gave this movie a chance on merit as opposed to star power, it did fall a bit short.   Therefore I'd moderately recommend this one.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|\\"Underworld:Evolution\\" is a no-holds barred bloodfest...and those are always fun. As others have said it focuses on the vampire elder Marcus and his mission to set his twin brother William free from his underground prison where he was locked against Marcus' will hundreds of years earlier. Standing in his way are Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman)who may hold the secret to giving him what he wants. Ok, with that being out of the way I will explain briefly the pros and cons without giving away plot points so I won't spoil it for anyone. <br /> <br />Pros(+) Continuity between films is great b/c it takes place  minutes after the 1st film.  <br />The action and special effects are all done very well, with this movie being even gorier then the first. <br />Marcus is a really cool looking villian and is a great match for Selene.   <br /> <br />Cons(-) Lycans literally take a back seat in this film. I say this for the people who pull for the Lycans in this \\"Blood Feud\\". They are numerous but mindless and are killed very easily. Unlike the first film where Lucian was the alpha male, there are no alpha males in this movie, and for being the 1st lycan, William is a HUGE dissapointment, he attracts alot of bullets, but other then that he stands still with his mouth open. Trust me people, I looked forward to William's arrival the whole movie and was dissapointed.  <br />The \\"Sex\\" scene was pitiful. The director is Kate Beckinsale's husband, so what you get is some \\"Belly-Button\\" sex that is laughable and really does takes you out of the film. For those of you that like a little sex in your movies, it comes in a scene with the vampire historian, Tanis and some vamp whores..now that's good stuff.  <br /> <br />In the end I really do enjoy this film, I just wanted to point out a few things that bothered me, and may bother you. A good DVD to own though. I recommend it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I never write reviews, but after seeing this movie, felt compelled too.  This movie is absolutely lovely.  Keira and Matthew are brilliant, along with an excellent supporting cast, breath-taking country-side make this film definitely worth seeing. I too am a fan of Mr. Firth, but Mr. MacFadyen brings more emotional depth to the role.  There is one scene that makes me melt everytime and that scene is when Mr. Darcy first declares his love for Elizabeth in the pouring down rain.  Those piercing blue eyes, the emotion of the declaration that he's made, makes you feel the emotion.  Makes you believe in fairy tales.  See this movie, you won't regret it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I noticed there were a staggering 900+ reviews for this movie with an average of ****1/2 stars. Let me tell you guys something, the rating for this movie doesn't lie...except for the fact it's a ***** in my book. I had not seen the show when I picked up \\"Serenity\\", it didn't matter. This movie is enjoyable from beginning to end. The cast is truly amazing to watch, and everyone of them is very entertaining. The special effects are very good, and the story is involving and intricate. It's a great sci-fi/action/western/dramedy that is fun, but at the same time can be serious and deep. I have not seen many movies like this. I don't want to go into the plot because to do it justice would take a couple pages, and every second you spend reading it is a second that you could spend picking it up for yourself. Strongly Recommended. (I have since seen the show and it is great as well.)
B000F0UUIM|5.0|This new edition of John Ford's The Searchers is outstanding. I saw this film years ago on TV, and now I'm glad I waited to buy any copy of it.<br />Picture: Top-notch. For epic landscapes, this movie is to the West what Lawrence of Arabia is to the Middle East, and the transfer for this DVD is beautiful, doing full justice to Winton Hoch's cinematography. Always sharp; doesn't look bad at all.<br />Sound: Excellent as well.<br />Special features: Adequate, but as I've said before, I didn't buy the DVD for the features--the picture-quality and sound are what really sell this edition.<br />This is the kind of treatment Warner Brothers needs to give to some of its other great old films, especially the ones sitting in vaults right now, like Sergeant York, or those that still haven't had a good outing on DVD, like some of John Wayne's other films. If you've been waiting for a good home entertainment copy of The Searchers to come around, this is it.
0671027344|5.0|I am 15 years old, and cannot believe how much i realte to this book. There were parts when i went back a re-read it and because i always wondered if i was the only one who thought this way {\\"i walk around the hallways..\\"}.   <br />If you listen to the song \\"Asleep\\" by The Smiths, you can tell why Charlie is so drawn to it.  When I first heard the song, it was after i read the book, and the image of Charlie in the tunnel in the truck popped into my head. and you can understand him a a little more. <br />This is the best book i have ever read. and i'm not exaggerating. and i've read alot of classics & not so classics. <br />this is definitely a book that EVERY teenager should read. and parents, the \\"adult themes\\" are handled VERY well, and i feel that the book wouldn't be as good without them just because it's a big part of Charlie's lifeand a big influenece on him. <br />i'm DEFINITELY going to read this again, because i've found out some other things about the book..and i want to go back and evalute every detail. :D.. <br /> <br />{and i have never read a book twice.} <br /> <br />PLEASE MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS WELL WORTH IT.
B000E6UWE4|5.0|Here is the bottom line to this fantasy book. You are either going to love it or hate it. If you like stories that focus on one central character with little to no break offs to other characters and if you don't like juggling a bunch of characters then this is not the book for you. Don't read it. However, if you like REAL world building and an entralling in-depth read. This is the book for you. It has action, twists, turns, warrens and much much more. I loved it. If this is sounds like something you like, please give this book a try.
B000093OU8|5.0|THE WILD FRONTIER is another Gary Moore masterpiece. Many of the songs here have Irish-related themes, which may make them hard to understand, but if you eat enough foods rich in B-vitamins and omega-3 oils, and then listen VERY HARD, you can relate them to universal issues with which all of us can identify. In other words, THE WILD FRONTIER is an album that will give you what you want, if you let it give you what you need.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is not a perfect movie (I really would rather give it 4 1/2 stars or so) but it is still excellent. It is by far my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (and I've seen all the available versions except the Mormon one- 1940, 1980, 1995, and Bride and Prejudice). This movie is very realistic in that it portrays how unclean times were back then (no, it's not dirty or gross or anything, don't worry). Perhaps the filmmakers went a little too far in the case of the Bennet house, but that was done to contrast their situation to those of Darcy and Bingley.<br /><br />The casting is excellent. I was hesistant about Keira Knightley at first (I'd only seen a couple of her other movies and liked her in Bend it Like Beckham), but her Lizzy blew me away. She portrayed the arch, outspoken side of Lizzy as well as her sweet, unoffending nature. She also really showed the character's youth. Matthew McFayden's Darcy was totally different from any interpretation I've seen (shy, puppydog) but I couldn't call it inaccurate. He and Lizzy really have chemistry together. Brenda Blethyn was an amazing Mrs. Bennet- she is annoying and embarrassing but believable not over-the-top. Rosamunde Pike is the beautiful Jane I have been waiting for. None of the other Janes I've seen are even as pretty as Lizzy. Some of the changes people might not like (but that I love)- Bingley is more of a goof, Caroline is a little meaner, Mary is prettier, and Mr. Bennet a more caring father (this one did bother me a little).<br /><br />On top of the great cast, the cinemotography is breathtaking, the music is beautiful, it uses a lot of Austen's own dialogue (but changes some of it slightly), and it's also hilarious. This was perhaps my favorite movie of 2005.
B00005NNMK|5.0|THE FINAL COUNTDOWN is, along with PRISONERS IN PARADISE, one of Europe's two best CDs. The title track's lyrics seem, at first listen, to be about Armageddon, but dig a little deeper and you'll find that this is actually a metaphor for having to leave the past behind in order to achieve your dreams. In fact, that meaning came to me when I put my dreams of looking good for several gorgeous actresses as a higher priority than attending food-related functions at my old school. \\"Cherokee\\", with its explicit references to the Trail Of Tears, could be, in a larger sense, about ANY type of deceit and betrayal, and describes how I felt when the man who helped me get in shape for a number of TV and movie hotties left me without telling me directly that he was going, leaving someone else to tell me, simply because I support abortion in certain types of cases. The whole album, however, is great, and proves that the styles of proggers like Kansas and hard rockers like Ted Nugent can blend convincingly in the right hands.
B00005MP58|4.0|This was the first adaptation I saw (almost) in full. I missed some of the first episode. I can't remember exactly what point it was when I first turned it on, but I believe it was the Meryton Assembly. I was so excited to see it because I read the book for the first time shortly before this and only saw the \\"WTF\\" ending of the 1940 version. I remember seeing a gorgeous brunette and a not so pretty blonde and thought immediately that the former must be Jane, because of her beauty. I wondered if the blonde was Elizabeth or if she was someone else. Then I heard them talking and realized that the beauty was Elizabeth and the \\"ugly\\" one was Jane! It took a while to get over that initial shock but I managed to enjoy the series all the same. There were (and still are) some parts that still irk me but there's nothing I can do about it, really. I've seen the series quite a few times since I purchased the DVD boxset 4 years ago. That boxset was horrible, by the way. I recently got the new remastered version and it is much better. The colors are so vivid and I can finally see all the beauty of the costumes and the scenery that I didn't before due to the grayed, washed out older DVDs.<br /><br />This is probably one of the, if not THE most famous and popular Jane Austen adaptation ever. Many fans call it definitive. I shudder at any adaptation ever being called definitive, but even if I didn't I would not think this one was! I do appreciate its length and being able to see more of the story than in any of the others (it is longer than the 1980 version as well). It includes more characters and scenes. It is beautiful to look at (as long as you don't have the bad DVD set!), being shot on film and with higher production values than older adaptations had. I like how it followed \\"show, don't tell\\" throughout even though the timing of some of those \\"showings\\" bothered me (I'll get into it). It was really funny. It had good acting by some of the cast. And Lizzy has some really beautiful gowns (not so some of the other women).<br /><br />But then there are things that I don't like about it so much. Some of the cast is too old. Many characters are exaggerated even more than in the book and are made into caricatures. For some of them I didn't mind (Mr. Hurst), for others I did mind a lot! (Mrs. Bennet) Andrew Davies, the screenwriter, included a lot of extra Darcy scenes that are not in the book. It was sexed up (mostly, but not only, Darcy), etc. And I don't like that Andrew Davies gives away the book's surprises before the characters learn of them! We hear Darcy narrating his letter to Elizabeth and see flashbacks of its contents before she reads the letter. We see Darcy at Pemberley before Elizabeth does (in the infamous pond scene). And we see him looking for Wickham and Lydia in London and then present at their wedding, before Elizabeth learns of it! Maybe they thought it wasn't important since they figured viewers had already read the book? Most people likely had not (and still haven't) so it irritates me. Could they not have showed those scenes after the fact, as flashbacks? That would have made more sense to me. Does this mean I hate the adaptation? NO! I really don't. I do not mean to bash it and I hope it doesn't sound that way. On my latest viewing, I actually found more to like about it than I did before!<br /><br />If you're going to get the DVD, get this restored version because the old special edition box set has a horrible, dull gray picture quality.s (not so some of the other women).

B000BGH22W|4.0|I was both shocked and disappointed to see that John Williams had been ditched and replaced with a new composer for the music, and was sad to see that this new guy for the most part rewrote it all. <br /> <br />Despite all this however, I really enjoyed what was done and really enjoyed the remix of the Harry Potter theme. I'm sad it wasn't used more. <br /> <br />All in all, the music was good enough that it made the movie seem much more enjoyable to me, which is saying something since The Goblet of Fire is by far my least favorite of the group.
0671015206|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door is a good first book for the budding investor. There are many approaches to gaining wealth, and this book takes the slow, steady, and safest route to financial independence. Frugality is a recurring theme in the book, and simple arithmetic does show the authors' research to be accurate. Even the next generation of high-rolling stock brokers needs seed money, and the Millionaire Next Door really hammers home the need to save. <br /> <br />Another interesting facet of the book is insight into the millionaire mindset. Most people think of millionaires as caviar-eating, Rolls-Royce driving top hats. That may be the case in some situations, but the average millionaire is an entrepreneur that lives below his means. One thing I wanted to learn more about was actual investing. I look at this book as the first step on the road to solvency. Also helpful is the advice on how to handle your kids after you make the big bucks. Think you're helping them with endless cash gifts? Read this book. <br /> <br />As a young, novice investor, personal finance seems to be a mix of knowledge, luck, and logic. I'm sure there is more, but I would definitely recommend the Millionaire Next Door to anyone who has a little money and wants a little more. Financial independence is not so much of a recipe as it is a garden; you need to tend it regularly and wisely for success. And the fruits are not guaranteed even when you do everything right.  However, books like these provide a good starting ground into a complicated topic.   <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna goes on a whole other direction with \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\".  Her sound is the same, only this time with awesome backbeats!  \\"Hung Up\\" combined with Abba's music to \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" is a cool song and the Abba music suits the song 110%  I agree with one review; the song \\"I Love New York\\" she says 'if youu don't like my attitude then you can f off'.  I mean, say the whole word!  In the same song she says 'pussys' with no problem.  WTF?  Anyways this is a fantastic cd and it is meant to be played FULL BLAST!!!
B00004U28G|2.0|I purchased this video because Amazon had the offer of purchasing 3 DVD or videos and receiving a 4th one free.

B000C4SHRW|5.0|Garth Nix is a talented writer and spinner of tales.
B000001E3L|5.0|I love Van Morrison, his music is so deep, spiritual and groovy. This is one of his best albums to date, but none of his albums is bad. He got a few of 5 stars albums in my opinion. I got pretty much all of his albums and have listen to them, when you have (a) song(s) you liked on another of his albums and you hear it on this in live version its amazing. My favourites on this, (but there isnt a bad song on this), are: \\"I Forgot That Love Existed\\" (SWEET!), \\"It Fills You Up\\" (FUNKY!), \\"See Me Through/Soldier of Fortune/Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agai\\" (SUGAR!). My opinion all of this of course.
B000059PPN|2.0|Fans of the Beyond might want to watch this for the \\"Frankenstein-like\\" man living in the basement of a creepy old house in the woods. A little kid ends up in the cellar with horrible results. Most of the film is spent researching the history of the house and owner via audio recordings, as a few guests, including the babysitter discover the nightmare waiting below, who happens to be looking for bodyparts to add to his own body.<br /><br />Some classic Fulci gore here and there amongst the very slow, drawn out story, and a great worm gut scene at the end.<br /><br />Worth a look for gorehounds who don't mind a whiny kid. Fulci's \\"The Beyond\\" ranks way 'beyond' this however.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First time I heard CODF, I didn't like it at all. Sounded like somekind of a cheap disco. But, anyways, I kept CD on my cd-player and the more I listened it, the more I liked it. Now I think it's one of her greatest album all time. Yeah. Yeah. I love all tracks except Future Lovers n Like It Or Not. The greatest songs are: Get Together, I Love New York and Jump !
0553801503|2.0|This book is mostly walking and talking, heraldry and clothing, and predictable.  Not much actually happens.  And, due to the 5 year gap between novels, I'd forgotten most of the plot line.  I had to force myself to finish the book. <br /> <br />Then I reread the first book (published 10 years ago now), and I couldn't put it down.  Fast-paced, exciting, very unexpected even on a re-read.  A Feast for Crows falls far below the standard set in the first book. <br /> <br />The author points out that this is really just the first part of his novel, and the second part will be published soon.  Unfortunately, I have to believe the next book will be just as tedious and disappointing. <br /> <br />Fans of Robert Jordan will recall how his first 5 novels were great, but then something happened and years passed between the publication of each succeeding novel, which had little action and was mostly walking, talking and clothing. This collapse in the Robert Jordan series led me to look for an alternative, which I thought I found in the fast-paced George R.R. Martin series.  But now we see, Martin caught Jordan-itis.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This is a spectacular album, the unnecessary bonus tracks notwithstanding, and almost singlehandedly rescued the reputation of this band, which had been tarnished by the horrifying \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" and the tepid \\"Relayer\\".    Every track here is like its own universe, and there are stunning moments from each player as well as tremendous collective songcraft and beautiful, uncluttered production.  Hell, I even like Alan White's playing on this one, and I usually can't stand him.  I kind of feel sorry for him actually, because following Bill Bruford in a band has gotta be a bit like following Jesus at the Jerusalem Hilton.  Just ask Pat Mastelotto.    This record is quite a ride, beginning with the crunchy steel guitar madness of the title track (punctuated by the singer's humorously self-effacing words deriding his overly \\"cosmic mind\\").  This song almost sounds like a cross between \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" from Fragile and the Flying Burrito Brothers' \\"Train Song,\\" if you can imagine such a thing without having your head spontaneously explode.    The next tune is a Yes classic of storytelling, about a sculptor whose muse dies, leaving him to attempt to resurrect her out of stone in his work.  The peaks of this song are just over the moon, culminating with the transcendent guitar part that comes out of the line about how \\"when we're young, love lingers so\\" and punctuated throughout by ultra-gorgeous acoustic arabesques from the fingers of Howe and an floaty, enveloping soundstage production-wise.  My personal favorite on this disc and maybe my all-time favorite Yessong.    Next is the Squire showcase, the fat-bottomed \\"Parallels,\\" which sounds not unlike \\"Hold Out Your Hand\\" from his then-current solo record, the excellent Fish Out of Water.  Great super-churchy organ from the Caped Crusader here, as well as some nice multitracking on the voices.  This features that trademark, diatonic, positive mood this band was/is famous for.    On side two we begin with a brief, lush sing-along and proceed into the conclusion of the original LP with one of the great Yes epics, \\"Awaken,\\" which just soars along like the Earth at 60,000 MPH at that moment in the morning when the sun breaks your particular horizon.  To call \\"Awaken\\" celestial in character would be like calling Black Sabbath \\"loud\\".    Anyhow like I said the bonus cuts are needless, but the original album is so good that it doesn't matter.  The booklet, however, was very well done with all kinds of new photos (including the one from the original LP gatefold where the naughty, half-hidden smoking apparatus is visible!).
B000000HU1|5.0|The third installment of the Trilogy is my personal favorite, probably because there's less singing and more blistering playing, especially from Steve Hillage and the immortal \\"Bloomdido\\" Malherbe.  Of course all three installments are required \\"PHP 101\\" course material but if you were just dipping your toe into the waters of this most singular & amazing band I might suggest \\"You\\" as the place to begin, if only because it seems a bit more streamlined and accessible.  Which is not to say that it isn't completely balls-out nuts either.    The lyrics here are of a more general nature and speak less to the convoluted sci-fi storyline that dominates the preceding two records... of course the Pot Head Pixies and the Octave Doctors are still front-and-center but the words are given over more towards an explication of their general philosophy as characters than to explaining who they are and how they fit in to the Gong Mythology.  Really this album is more of an even split between singing and playing and like I said this gives the instrumentalists space to shine superbly... the sticker on the CD said that You sounds like \\"King Crimson on 10 hits of acid\\" and I for one wouldn't deny the accuracy of such a statement.    As for the copy protection issue, I live in the States and got the US issue, which doesn't have that added feature of shameless evil, so I guess I should rejoice and count my blessings.  All I can say is that if the record companies would focus 1/1000th of the energy they give to preventing \\"theft\\" towards actually providing product that was worth stealing in the first place, we'd live in a better and more expressive world.  But don't hold your breath.    Do, however, buy this and every Gong album from the 1970s because they are essential!
B00007KWHP|5.0|A stunning achievement from the Golden Age of Progressive Rock, when you could put Brahms on your record and not seem/sound like a total prat.    This one and its successor (\\"Close to the Edge\\") kind of belong together, like two sides of the same coin.  Strangely, I think the songs on Fragile are better but Close to the Edge works better as an album.    This contains several Prog standards, including the obvious hit (\\"Roundabout\\"), Long Distance Runaround and the absolutely blistering Heart of the Sunrise, which contains perhaps the funkiest moment in all of Prog (after the first stomping riff section, where everything drops out and it's just the bass and Bill Bruford's ridiculously tasty, triplet-obsessed drums).  But my favorite cut here has gotta be South Side of the Sky, about two guys out hiking in the mountains that freeze to death, of all things to write a song about!  Of course, the sunny, diatonic mood of Yes makes such a harrowing story sound almost happy and welcoming.    Of the solo pieces that dot the record I prefer Steve Howe's flamenco-ish Mood for a Day and the epic Chris Squire sponge-bath called The Fish.  Squire just kind of blows up this whole album, taking the bass to a whole other level in the rock context with his manic Rick-picking style.  Was he the first of the plectrum-using bassists or did Jack Bruce do that first?  I guess the biggest innovation was to tune the bass up higher to match the toppy, one-of-a-kind sound of Bruford's snare... together they form quite a distinctive rhythm section.    Overall this is a helluva record and one of the ten essential Progressive Rock albums of all time.  Plus the remaster sounds fantastic, unlike the muddily crap-tastic original issue... especially as applies to the keyboards provided by the Caped Crusader, which just thoroughly sucked on the old CD of this one.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br />I think the filmmakers successfully combined difficult theme with entertainment, even if there aren't many action sequences. <br /> <br />I liked many memorable quotes and witty conversation throughout the film, especially Valerie's \\"an inch....we must never let them take it from us\\" and V's \\"if you are looking for the guilty, you need only look in the mirror\\" etc. <br />Yes, V is right, each one of us is responsible for our society because we are all part of it.  I thought this movie suggests  we should not blindly believe what we see or hear - we especially tend to do so when we are in fear. <br /> <br />Besides the story, Hugo Weaving is a great actor.  I got fascinated by his speech, which made V attractive. <br /> <br />I would give Vendetta more stars if I could. <br /> <br />
B000FILW86|4.0|When writing a review of Cheap Trick several things have to be considered: 1. The band has been around for approximately 30 years now 2. They are highly underrrated 3. Fans are divided as to which period of Cheap Trick is the best and worst, and 4. The band has been through numerous musical changes over the years.<br /><br />That being said, I am a fan who has all of Cheap Trick's albums. I think their first 6 albums are their best, and that \\"Next Position Please\\" through \\"Busted\\" was some of their weakest material. I think 1994's \\"Woke Up With A Monster\\" began the climb back to Cheap Trick's rightful place, with 1997's \\"Cheap Trick\\" being their best recent album to date. \\"Special One\\" and now \\"Rockford\\" are about the same, and they don't match 1997's \\"Cheap Trick\\" song for song.<br /><br />\\"Rockford\\" sounds very much like a rocking-on-all-cylinders Cheap Trick album. In some ways it reminded me of their '77 debut and \\"In Color\\". In fact, the lead track \\"Welcome To The World\\" is a close cousin to \\"In Color's\\" \\"Hello There\\". The Beatles, a major influence for the band, is evident not only on \\"Welcome To The World\\", but also on \\"O Claire\\". I liked the co-written Linda Perry (of 4 Non Blondes) track \\"Perfect Stranger\\" as well as \\"Come On Come On Come On\\", \\"One More\\", \\"Dream The Night Away\\", \\"All Those Years\\" and \\"Decaf\\".<br /><br />So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, \\"Rockford\\" is competent but not as original or lyrical as 1997's \\"Cheap Trick\\" in terms of recent work. \\"Rockford\\" is a solid rock album with total cohesiveness, but lacking in individual distinctive tracks. The one thing that can be said about Cheap Trick is that they deliver the goods almost every album. That's quite an accomplishment 30 years into the music business. They show no signs of fatigue, and for the past three albums they've had almost complete control over their music like they always should have had. Now, where's the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction and recognition of a band that's contributed a cornerstone to rock music????contributed a cornerstone to rock music????
B000003S0P|5.0|A definitive statement not just of the end of the Golden Age of Progressive Rock, but of the 1960s-style countercultural maelstrom of experimentation that spawned the genre whilst simultaneously changing so much about the greater world forever. <br /> <br />This plays like a wake for \\"the sixties\\" in many ways, most clearly and poignantly on the stunning climactic masterpiece \\"Starless,\\" which is just uber-cinematic in scope and execution.  The horns of the departed Crimson Kings Mel Collins and Ian MacDonald make this almost like the ribbon bow tied on this genre-defining band, like Crimsons past and present colliding in perfect alignment to make a grand, perfect statement of summation about everything this group stood for in its time. <br /> <br />Perhaps more than any other group outside of the Beatles, this band symbolized the ethos of anything-goes experimentation and boundary-shattering creativity that characterized the end of the Piscean Age and the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, i.e., the late 1960s and early 1970s, when old and obsolete modalities of life and living were falling onto the dustbin of history faster than in any other previous cultural revolution in human history. <br /> <br />This group made such an impact with so little observable compromise largely because, beginning when it came on the scene as \\"the next Beatles\\" in early 1969, it continually proved that what everyone thought was possible in Rock Music was only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, and that indeed the only limitation on the breadth of what could be aspired to by the musicians was the inestimable power of their own imaginations.  With each incarnation KC has altered the musical DNA in a certain way, and this album is no exception. <br /> <br />There is nothing to be said about this music that hasn't already been said by the articulate and passionate people who wrote about it previously.  Yes, the compositions are tritonally heavy (that's why it's called \\"Red,\\" as the smoking VU meter on the back cover with its needle pushed all the way to the right attests).  Yes, the vocals of John Wetton never sounded better or had more conviction.  Yes, the drumming is perhaps the greatest ever achieved on a Rock album and proof positive of why Bill Bruford is one of the greatest ever on his instrument in any genre.  But beyond the specifics this is a valedictory for an unprecedented and important period, all too brief and fleeting, in which Music in particular and Humanity in general seemed to be trying to cast off the chains in so many ways. <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you have never discovered this group, you have lucked out because they might be, in terms of creativity and challenge to existing musical structures within the pantheon of Rock, the greatest of all time.  You should buy all of their albums and dive right in, but this masterpiece is surely a fine place to begin.
B0002RGNRU|4.0|I watched this movie recently per a friend's recommendation, when it actually came out I did not have any interest as I am not a big Jim Carrey fan. When I was told Carrey's performance was as good as in `Truman Show' I decided to watch it.<br /><br />The movie basically tells the story of  Joel and Clementine, they had a relationship that did not end well, luckily for both, there is a doctor (Tom Wilkinson) who offers an alternative to suffering from heart breaking: erase all the memories related to a person. While the premise sounds a little too weird (written by Charlie Kauffman who previously gave us `Being John Malkovich'), it establishes a very interesting possibility, what if you could do this? (There is a funny moment in which we get to see an old lady waiting for the memories of her dead puppy to be erased.. if you have suffered the loss of a dog you'll understand). The director makes you think about it for a while; yes, we do all have memories we would wish to go away, but would we do it? Is it better to forget than to face and learn from the experience? The `memory deleting' situation is definitely one of the best moments of the film.<br /><br />And it is because in Joel's `memory deleting' process (which takes the most part of the film), we get to see all their memories together... tender moments that make you realize what a wonderful relationship they had. It is in this moment in which Joel faces the fact that he may not want to delete Clementine from his head. There are other subplots related to the characters who perform the `memory deleting' which are ok but do not add anything of value to the central story of Joel and Clementine.<br /><br />While it has some funny moments the movie is not a comedy, actually Carrey's acting is superb in his character of quiet and indecisive Joel, Kate Winslet performs great as supporting Clementine in Joel's brain while his memories are being deleted.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the premise of the film, it is a very serious movie about relationships and what we learn from them. Directed by Michel Gondry (who has in his resume some of Bjork's best music videos) you can expect not only a good film but also a very interesting visual experience.t is a very serious movie about relationships and what we learn from them.

B0001NBMBC|2.0|Let's flash back to 1999 for a moment...Slipknot, this fresh new band, comes onto the scene with a sound both heavy and angry, something that wasn't being played on the mainstream at all. They follow up the self titled affair with Iowa, a CD that retains the heaviness and anger, ultimately feeling like a perfect companion disc. Now we have Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses, a CD that was hyped beyond belief by not only the band but also the media.<br /><br />To say that this CD was a disappointment is an understatement. I loved Slipknot because of their unforgiving brand of metal. Cory had one of my favorite voices in music, the band sounded crisp and heavy, etc. But with Vol. 3 Cory dulls his voice to little more than a hearty yell, at no point does he pull out the voice we came to love on the past two releases. As for the band, that intensity just isn't there like it used to be. The CD as a whole, well, 'watered down' is the phrase that comes to mind. Someone brought their side project to the table instead of the sound that made Slipknot adored by so many.<br /><br />Ultimately, only four songs save this CD from being completely unlistenable. The Blister Exists is a great song once you get used to the change. Circle, as much as I hate to admit it, is a great ballad. Ballad and Slipknot just shouldn't be said in the same sentence, it's like saying Britney Spears has an amazing voice, it doesn't sound right. Welcome and Pulse Of The Maggots are the only two songs that bring any amount of the energy executed on the first two releases to us. That's it, four songs out of 14 that are good.<br /><br />My favorite songs are The Blister Exists, Circle, Welcome, and Pulse Of The Maggots. In no way is this the Slipknot I came to love, and I can only hope that if they make another CD that it'll take them back to the days where total disregard for opinions seemed to be what got them off. Changing and growing as a band is great, and it should happen, but this isn't growing as a band, this is giving in to pressure to make a radio ready CD. I hate that this CD even had to be made and it certainly hasn't held any of it's integrity since it was first released. Needless to say, if you like Stone Sour, you'll love Vol. 3.a band, this is giving in to pressure to make a radio ready CD.

B000FA57RG|5.0|This album is the best live album ever. Imagine, Like a Prayer, Music, Lament and especially American Life. It is well worth it for any Madonna fan. The DVD is similar to Truth or Dare, which bored me quite frankly. The CD is great. <br />
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC ARE AMONGST THE GREATEST HARD ROCK BANDS.I REALLY LOVE THEM AS THEY HAVE PRODUCED SEVERAL EXCELLENT ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS MASTERPIECE WITH BRIAN JOHNSON.EACH AND EVERY SONG IS GOOD.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWERS LIKE THE PREVIOUS GIRL.BUY IT.
B000BVD460|5.0|This CD is mostly his big hits...2 new HOT songs and the live performance of \\"Stan\\" feat. Elton John. AMAZING CD. I personally LOVE Eminem. I like how he has matured SOMEWHAT and calmed down with all the violence..haha but still this man has amazing skills. You can not deny that what i say is a true fact. This CD is great. The perfect fairwell. HOWEVER i hope we'll hear from him again. TOTALLY RECOMMEND
B00008BXJG|5.0|I LOVE AC/DC.THEY ARE IN MY LIST OF THE TOP 10 BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME.I JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF TWO OF THE GREATEST SINGERS OF ALL TIME BON SCOTT AND BRIAN JOHNSON WHO ARE A BILLION TIMES BETTER THAN MARK KNOPFLER,KURT COBAIN AND LOU GRAMM.DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWERS WHO GIVE THIS MASTERPIECE ONE STAR.EVEN A BILLION STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS CLASSIC.RECOMMENDED.
B00000255F|5.0|It's easy to forget how good this album is or take it for granted. When I first heard it in 1975, I was swept away with Bruce's cinematic approach and intensity. The Phil Spector-like production values and lyrical visions of tough luck kids on  fast cars or motorcycles wanting out of the dreary overcast Jersey landscape, looking across the river to New York, hoping for a better life is poignant. He captures the characters and the moods very well. This is a unifying theme thoughout most blue-collar neighborhoods in America. It was a very romantic view of young America with a mix of doo-wop, hustlers, rock and roll, and West Side Story images. This is without a doubt..ONE OF THE TEN BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME! Unfortunately, when you hit 75 home runs with a .450 average for one season, everyone expects the same again and again. In my estimation, I've always been waiting for another Born To Run, but that would be impossible. 1978's Darkness, was a shadow of that. 1984's Born In The USA came close.  It's the Orson Welles syndrome, after Citizen Kane...how can you top that! Well, if Bruce never recorded another note after Born to Run, he would have still made rock history. Every song is a Rolls Royce in production, melody and lyrical values. When you create a masterpiece...what can you do for an encore?
B00005J6UP|5.0|one of my favorite movie of all time. i wish i was part of the movie. when i found it finally i grabbed it as fast as i can.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Firefly was a show that I am proud to call my favorite television show of all time despite the fact that only fourteen episodes exist. The show is my favorite because of the ideas behind it, a sci-fi western filled with clever dialouge, lovable characters and episodes with plots that were highly original. Serenity takes some risks by ditching some of the things that made the show great, like the entire western feel of the show is almost entirely blotted out of the film. Why? Because the movie doesn't focus on the frontier planets like the show did, instead it goes deeper into the sci-fi vein, space-fights, big explosions and spaceship chasing. Don't fret though the use of sci-fi in the movie is perfect, it focuses on the shadowy high tech government of the Allaince so it all feels in place. Also, in a bit of irony the only thing I found truly western plot-wise in the picture were the Reavers, who never really appeared on the show. Reavers are in a very basic sense (and probably inspired by) native american scalpers. Anyway, the movie is great and it is a sci-fi movie for the ages.
B00005JOCU|5.0|My mother took me to see this stageplay back when I was about 14 years old and it was great. I can't wait for the movie although I'm a little concerned about some of the casting.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|The special edition is a must-have for fans of this movie and/or James Cameron.  I watched the movie with Cameron's commentary running, and he was fascinating.  I felt like I was sitting alongside him as he unveiled his perfectionism and creativity. Unlike some director commentaries on DVDs, there are virtually no lulls in Cameron's monologue -- he is talking straight through the movie. <br />I watched the first 30 minutes with the historical commentary, but found Cameron's commentary to be more insightful and entertaining. <br />As a sidenote, props to Cameron for nixing the original ending!
B000EHSVQE|4.0|The one, the only, Napoleon Dynamite. This is a very hard movie to review. I loved it, but not everybody will. (No Spoilers Included)<br /><br />The open-ended one sentence summary: A stupid nerd who lives in Idaho deals with his weird everyday life.<br /><br />Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Some mild bad language, some bullying, and couple light innuendos.<br /><br />Characters: 3 of 5 stars. This movie was not a marvel of acting, and I wouldn't go so far as to call the characters loveable, but they were all very memorable. You'll probably just laugh and/or think they're stupid.<br /><br />Plot: 2.5 of 5 stars. No plot whatsoever. Just everyday escapades and quoteable lines in Napoleon Dynamite's life. It managed to keep my attention, though. I even asked \\"Why are we interested in this?\\" as we were watching, then continued being interested.<br /><br />Cinematography: 5 of 5 stars. The high rating is due to the excellent scenery/props/locations. The movie is set in a run-down, rural Idaho, and is complete with 70's shag carpets, ketchup stains, unmown lawns, and quiet flea-market type stores.<br /><br />Music: 4 of 5 stars. Perfect for the movie. It's that same kind of retro-tacky instrumental music that goes so well with the retro-tacky surroundings.<br /><br />Impact: 4 of 5 stars. It's a flippin' cult hit, what do ya think? You'll either love it or hate it, and I loved it. The biggest impact is the insanely quoteable lines. PS: watch till after the credits.<br /><br />All in all, 4 of 5 stars.
0930289528|5.0|In an alternate universe England, a vicious, third World War destroyed the country's government, allowing right-wing, Nazi-like dictators to take over and transform it into a fascist police state--a living hell of a place where secret police run the streets and the ones in charge use hidden surveillance to keep watch over everything and everyone at all times. Everything now seems \\"normal\\" and free of any crime, evil or corruption. But there is one man who sees the true ugliness behind everything, a man, a Guy Fawkes mask-clad, cloaked, anarchist revolutionary known only as \\"V,\\" who uses vigilantism and terrorism as \\"message.\\" This \\"V\\" is actually a former prisoner and guinea pig to a dangerous hormone that most likely caused him to lose his mind, from one of the hellish resettlement camps abundant during the war, condemned for his radical, political beliefs. But now he's back, and he has vendetta on the brain. But his violent tactics are only a small part of a theatrical, one-man conspiracy to destroy England fascist government. Along the way, V rescues a young woman, Evey Hammond, who proves she may be of some help to the radical vigilante. <br /> <br />Most likely playing seconds only to \\"Watchmen\\" as Alan Moore's greatest achievement, the master writes his deepest, most personal fears into \\"V for Vendetta\\"--a world without people of different race, sexual orientation, political dissidents, anything that reminds us of diversity. What Moore says in his work is without diversity there is no spiritual growth, and without spiritual growth there is no freedom, and without freedom there is no choice, and without choice there is no real justice. Although \\"Watchmen\\" is regularly regarded as Moore's best work, \\"V for Vendetta\\" deserves as much praise, if not more. In some area's \\"V for Vendetta\\" is actually stronger and scarier than \\"Watchmen,\\" mainly because the main \\"hero\\" uses terrorism to make the world a \\"better\\" place. \\"V for Vendetta\\" is also a more, possibly the most, personal of Moore's writes because of the way he describes his innermost fears--a disturbingly real world where diversity is banned in a Nazi-like England. <br /> <br />What I like best about Moore's works is that he always has some kind of significant point to make. Similar to \\"Watchmen,\\" \\"V for Vendetta\\" is a story based on the \\"how much one COULD do for the world over how much one SHOULD do\\" formula Moore is known for. He does this brilliantly, and V is his most psychologically driven, and interesting character in any of his previous/future works. As a side note, it took me some getting used to Dave Lloyd's gritty, often flat, artwork (especially after Dave Gibbons' much \\"cleaner\\" artistic contribution on \\"Watchmen\\"), but it somehow fits the overall atmosphere and disturbing theme of Moore's dark story. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, to anyone with a taste for great, symbolic literature, and to all graphic novel enthusiasts. England prevails!
B00061RZXI|5.0|Have loved this movie since first seeing it on PBS in the early 80's.  Bought the VHS and cassette for all my relatives with kids as soon as they were available.  Have also looked for that beautiful song, and was pleased to hear it (also on PBS) recently sung on the \\"Celtic Woman\\" special, and now it is the first song on their new? CD entitled \\"Celtic Woman\\" (which is copyrighted 2004, I see) and there is also a DVD, Celtic Woman-The Show.

B00005JNRY|5.0|Lightning McQueen (Wilson) is a rookie in a NASCAR type race called the Piston Cup.  When the season ends with him in a tie with his two major rivals, Chick Hicks (Keaton) and The King (Petty), he must head to California for a tie-breaker race.  Along the way, he ends up stranded in Radiator Springs, arrested for traffic violations.  Doc Hudson (Newman), the town judge, sentences him to repair the road before he can leave.  Initially, he just wants to get done and get out, but soon he finds himself making friends with the locals, including Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Sally (Hunt).  Soon, this cocky race car who had no real friends finds he may not want to leave so fast after all.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for \\"Cars\\", I was worried.  It did not look good, and I thought Pixar had its first flop on its hands.  Bumping the release date back six months did not ease my worry.  That being said, \\"Cars\\" is an excellent movie.  Pixar, I am sorry that I ever doubted you.  The voices are perfect, especially Wilson, Newman, and Larry the Cable Guy.  The film looks great, with bright colors kids will love.  The story is nice, and like many Pixar movies, focuses on friendship.  The only drawback I can find is that it runs a little long.  Still, it is worth seeing by kids of all ages.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One word: Incredible    I initially missed this series when it aired, but watched the DVDs and was miserably hooked. I had no idea that I would stay up still 4AM watching every single episode! It's that good!!!    When you watch the series, I had to get past the cowboy in space (with a little asian culture thrown in) genre.  But the real power of the series comes from the actors and their execution of the story.  I think I can speak for most of these reviewers, and say that you fall in love with the characters, and feel the relationship that they can provide the viewers.    All of the characters (including the ship) are deeper than you think. Through out the series bread crumbs are dropped around each character.  The depth of each character slowly become clearer, and is used cleverly in the story line. The scripts are written with wit, and the plots are thick.    I'm not sure why the series was cancelled, but it should not have been. When you have over 2500 (at the time of this review) amazon customer reviews... AND none bad, that's got to say something!    The show is gorgeous. Special effects, sound effects, the ship, costumes, etc. There are shows that are cheesy. FireFly is not. The show done so well that you don't even notice how good the effects are. It sucks you in, and you don't realize it until the an episode is over.    Bottom line: If you love science fiction, you'll love this series.
0898705525|5.0|Chesterton's text is a great stand for the true rationality and beauty of Orthodoxy.  In reflecting up on his own discovery of orthodoxy, he seeks to show the sanity and beauty of Christian thought when compared to contemporary philosophies.  It would be difficult to tie down the work in a brief thesis, as it exists as a loose auto-biography of his thought processes coming to orthodox faith.   If I could be so bold as to venture to a thesis, it is that orthodoxy is the only guarantor of sanity, beauty, and forward progress in the world.  Beyond this, the text speaks for the specifics of these ideas. <br /> <br />Chesterton's text is witty and insightful.  For this reason, I suggest it most highly.  More than once did I laugh heartily at his reflections upon contemporary think.  Additionally, I often felt a chill as I thought, \\"This man has his finger on a truly good thought here.\\"  I suggest Orthodoxy to all, for it is an accessible, excellent read that will truly affirm a true vision of beauty in the world.

B0000931QA|5.0|\\"It's ten minutes past curfew, why are you still up?  Hello?  Hell-ooo?  Perhaps you need another shot.  There, that should do it...sweet dreams...you bastard...\\"<br /><br />So it begins...<br /><br />Nearly 20 years after its initial release, Operation Mindcrime truly stands the test of time.  Listening to it again, it's amazing how undated the album sounds.  I'm not speaking only of the musicianship, which shines on its own.  All five members of this incredible band - Geoff Tate and his opera-quality vocals; Chris de Garmo and Michael Wilton's shared guitar stylings; the rock solid bass of Eddie Jackson, and the almost insane drumming of Scott Rockenfield (whom along with Neil Peart, Mike Portnoy, and Terry Bozzio complete the holy quad of great drummers of rock) - are positively sublime.<br /><br />However, it is topically where this album resonates the most.  Eerily prophetic, Mindcrime's bleak vision of a country drunk on religion, sex and powerplays (to borrow from 'Spreading the Disease') is uncomfortably reminiscent of the U.S. situation now.  Nicky is that lost soul many of us could be, looking for hope and love in a world that doesn't seem to believe in it anymore.  Kind of sad how things have progressed steadily worse from the time this album was first released.<br /><br />One of my favourite tracks on this album is Suite Sister Mary, that begins with the ominous rumble of Dr. X who urges our anti-hero, Nicky, \\"kill her, that's all you have to do...\\"  It's a ten-minute magnum opus with vocalist Pamela Moore as the ex-stripper/prostitute/now nun, Sister Mary.  This is a role that not just any female singer could handle, especially because it called for singing duet with one of the greatest metal vocalists in the world and she pulled it off magnificently.  If you saw the concert production of Operation Mindcrime (I did - TWICE!!!), Ms. Moore wasn't using studio tricks either.  She was indeed the real deal.<br /><br />This is the album that actually wound up on the PMRC's 'Hit List' for the infamous line: \\"Educate the masses/Gonna burn the White House down\\".<br /><br />Let's face it though, while 'Eyes of a Stranger' did get some airplay, the entire album was (and is) way too cerebral for the MTV crowd.  For the rest of us who can appreciate artistry and thought-provoking themes in our music, Operation Mindcrime will always be one of the greatest musical works of the modern age.ally wound up on the PMRC's 'Hit List' for the infamous line: \\"Educate the masses/Gonna burn the White House down\\". <br /> <br />Let's face it though, while 'Eyes of a Stranger' did get some airplay, the entire album was (and is) way too cerebral for the MTV crowd.

B00005B4GU|4.0|Possibly the most cliched comment about Radiohead made by everybody from reviewers to randoms is \\"Before they went all wierd and electronic\\". Well if you want to criticise their experimental phase, criticise Kid A, because Amnesiac has a good bunch of songs. For example: <br /> <br />Knives out is an amazing, enduring song. Some say the live version is more over the top, but I prefer the restrained despair. Its not an operatic cry, its just holding on to existance. And, of course, a song about cannibalism. <br /> <br />Life in a Glasshouse features some great slightly warped jazz stuff. The clarinetist performs amazing runs and it deserves five stars. <br /> <br />Like Spinnining Plates is a space sounding song. Supposedly the band recorded an instrumental of this song, Yorke created his vocals, then the backing track was played backwards with Yorke Singing. It certainly sounds disconnected. Personallly it reminds me of a person flying forever into space away from all other humans. Great song, but it doesn't have an enormous lifespan.  <br /> <br />You and Whose Army has muted sort of vocals, not lo-fi but as if Yorke is singing through a padded loudspeaker. It takes a long time to develop into the faster paced bit, so you need patience. Unfortunately it makes the song seem a bit linear. 3 stars. <br /> <br />I haven't mentioned all the songs. The rest aren't fabulous but neither are they bad. <br /> <br />Overall, worth getting. Don't be put off by all the people whinging about the experimentation. Its not The Bends but everybody knows that.
B00006SFLV|5.0|Best tv show ever. A poignantly realistic and relateable depiction of a character who craves a more interesting exciting life, but is too much of a self-conscious dork to fully fit in with the cool crowd. It's a concept with a relevence that extends well beyond the high school setting and any gender limitations, although it's felt most keenly through the eyes of the teenage Angela Chase. The grunge fashion notalgia factor adds to the show's charm.  <br />
630471193X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Phenomenon, which I found to be an unusually graceful, warm, and genuine movie.  Sure, it had flaws, and one could take issue with a variety of departures from reality.  But the characters genuinely care for each other and the dialoge and behavior carefully reflect that.  I didn't try to take it too seriously, as I fell in love with George, the Dr., and Lace.  George genuinely cares about his friends.  The Dr., played wonderfully by the great Robert Duvall, understands people, and Lace is over the top sexy ( like some jewish women I have known...can Sedgwick be a jewish name?)  I thought the writing was great.  How about George teaching Nate the portuguese language?  Marvelous!  The little details and cinematography were very well done in this picture.  Kudos to the writer, director, and the guys behind the cameras.<br /><br />An added bonus is the soundtrack, which throughly enhances the movie at every turn.  Well done.  My final comment is absolutly true - I could watch this movie a hundred times.  I'm remodeling a house, and I play it in the background some days, so I've already seen it at least a dozen times.<br /><br />Many thanks.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|With catchy choruses, mad drumming, vocals that range from smooth persuasion to screaming passion in a matter of moments, and lyrics imbued with meaning, \\"The Sufferer and the Witness\\" has a lot to offer any music lover. <br /> <br />This is my first Rise Against album, and their previous relases have been bumped to the top of my \\"CDs to Buy\\" list.  I can't stop listening to it.  It's one of those CDs that feels like it transcends genre.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|With St. Elsewhere, the duo of vocalist Ce-lo and producer of the moment Danger Mouse have produced a left field hit that defies category.  The current hit CRAZY may be the best song on the album, but several others come close including the manic TRANSFORMER, JUST A THOUGHT, FEN SUI, GO-GO GADGET GOSPEL and STORM WARNING.  The duo shows their eclectic side well, especially on the cover of the Violent Femmes chestnut GONE DADDY GONE.  The weakest cuts are merely good and the CD as a whole invites one to hit the replay button over and over.  Call it dance music, rap, pop or what have you, Gnarles Barkley have delivered one of the more enjoyable CD's to come along in ages.

8389533391|5.0|This is one of the best and most creative films ever made. Totally inventive in concept, the story revolves around an exuberant and romantic Italian man named Guido, who also happens to be Jewish. He sweeps the woman of his dreams,his \\"Principessa\\", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.<br /><br />Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.<br /><br />In order to get his son through this horror as best he can, Guido tells his son that they are involved in a real life game to win a tank, knowing that the boy had wanted a toy tank for his birthday. Talk about a reality survival game! In any case, his son is young enough to fall for it and gets with the program as only the very young can. What follows is a series of inventive scenarios which tells the viewer of the lengths that the father goes in order to keep his son quiet, obedient, entertained, and safe from harm. All along, the father has his son believing in the game and playing to win, to the point that the boy believes that they are actually in first place to win the tank.<br /><br />While this may sound like an odd venue in which to find oneself laughing, that is exactly what the viewer does. At the same time, the film is achingly poignant, and the end is infinitely sad. Guido is played to perfection by comedic star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who also directed this masterpiece. His on screen wife and comedic foil is played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini.

B000FIMG68|2.0|1. Character deaths that lead to nothing. <br /> <br />2. Drawn out mysteries with no resolutions and or terrible resolutions. <br /> <br />3. Redundant flashbacks. <br /> <br />Its all coming true and Season 3 will only be more of the same. They will drag out even the most simplist of mysteries just to keep viewers watching every week. This isn't so much a show as it is a gimmick to keep you glued and guaranteed to come back to watch next weeks set of commercials. Many of our favorite characters have regressed making their character development worthless. Many characters have died due to the dumbest of reasons making their existence ultimately worthless. The Others have turned out to be not even remotely as interesting as we were led to believe in Season one. Unless you enjoy being taken for a ride and played for a fool don't bother watching Lost. Its proven that this show isn't commited to pleasing its audience but pleasing the network by never allowing us to learn anything new without watching 15 long drawn out episodes just to learn one single thing and than they add fifty more mysteries that you know they will never plan on revealing.  <br /> <br />Its a shaggy dog tail that can never have a satisfactory conclusion.

B000FGGE68|2.0|This movie turned out to be a dissapointment to me.  I think I am a fare fan of Science fiction movies, and I love to see a good adaptation from a comic, but this movie was missed the spot. First off, the acting was horrible. It seemed at time during the movie that they were reading off of cue cards or reading for the first time, no emotions with their deliveries, and the dialog back and forth was poorly written. Also, the computer animation part of the movie was to much, just didn't look good at all.  Finally, whats the deal with the antigravity everything and the color shifting cloths, Is that in the comic book?  If it is, I appologize, but if it was a movie adaptation, it would have been nice to have a little explanation behind the mechanism of some of these devices, and that would have been solved by actually puting in some real dialog.  I did not rate this a one, because it did have some ok fight scenes, but this is just worth a rental, unless you are a huge fan.
B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer's debut album \\"Show No Mercy\\" came out in 1983 the same year as Metallica's \\"Kill Em All\\". Although I personally like Metallica's debut better than this this is still an awesome album.<br /><br />To begin this review as well I'm going to tell a dark tale of metal in the early 80s: It was the 80s and a piece of sh i t was invented called MTV. It promoted selling out and was liked by brainless as sholes. People thought that metal was safe from this channel...WRONG!!! New bands like Twisted Sister, Quiet Riot, and Poison were making a new genre called hair metal which was an MTV friendly version of metal. It grossed old-school metal fans out with its spandex and glam. But in 1983 along came a band that hated MTV and wanted to make fast, heavy, and evil metal like its suppossed to. Girlie girls and moms feared them. MTV hated them. But a group of old-school metal fans embraced them. This band is called...SLAYER!!!<br /><br />Okay enough of history and let's get to the album. This album didn't exactly start thrash metal but it made it extremely heavy and fast. I liked Metallica(old) better than Slayer than a pinch but Slayer did make faster, heavier, and most of all eviler songs than Metallica ever did. Songs like \\"The Antichrist\\" are very Satanic but remember that this is only music. These lyrics don't reflect on the bands beliefs unlike whimps like Melissa and her Panic! At the Disco bullsh i t. Not everything is perfect though. I'm not a big fan of Tom Araya's voice on this album. But still this is a great debut and should be picked up!
B000002KO3|4.0|Adrian Belew makes this an incredible Cd. Great sounds come from his fingers and leaves you wondering how in the world did he make his guitar make that sound? Listening Winds is a great tune with terrorist's point of view. I am not all hot on terrorists but it's a good song. And of course the song about the water going under is the bomb from way back. This CD still holds the same place in my heart as it did 20 years ago.
0802130208|5.0|I loved this book. I found it charming and funny and clever and well written. I loved this book, but I make room for the possibility that others may not have had as enjoyable an experience as I.  <br /> <br />A few points: This book will be disappointing to those of you who need to like or identify with the characters in fiction. This book will be disappointing to those of you who need your characters to be explicitly redemptive. That's not the point of this book, and to be honest, that's the reason I find this book so remarkable.  <br /> <br />The characters in CoD feel very much like the characters I encounter in real life. As far as I can tell, a great many of the people on the planet are only likable or only seem to have any sort of redemptive quality to the people who already love them (for whatever reason). To the objective outside viewer (strangers in real life cases, the reader in the case of this novel) most people appear self-interested, arrogant, delusional, lazy, and the list goes on.  The fact that the characters in the book aren't always overtly likable only makes them feel more real. Then too, I think that if you look hard enough you'll discover at least one good quality about all of the characters. And you can also see how some of their not-so-great qualities are rooted in insecurity, fear, frustration, etc.  Again, this feels much like real life to me. <br /> <br />Now, I won't go so far as to suggest that disliking this book makes you some sort of idiot, but it's probably safe to say that if you tend toward Oprah's Book Club books, you probably won't be into CoD.
B00005JOUO|4.0|Spike Lee's `Inside Man' centers around a bank robbery in Manhattan, but if you are looking forward to seeing shoot-outs or explosions, you will be hugely disappointed. Lee's film is not about them; in spite of the hostage situation, it is more like a con-game done between three players - Denzel Washington's police detective, Clive Owen's bank robber, and Jodie Foster's mysterious female who represents the interest of one person. <br /> <br />To reveal much about the story will only lessen the fun you will get while watching cleverly constructed `Inside Man.' I only say this; the film deals with a `perfect crime' scenario. At the beginning of the film, in some dark place like a prison cell, one Dalton Russell, Clive Owen's enigmatic mastermind, tells you about his idea about perfect crime. He knows how to do it, and he means it.  <br /> <br />The film gradually reveals the true meaning of his words, showing how the four robbers led by Dalton hit the bank and take hostage. Denzel Washington's detective Keith Fraizer hurries to the crime scene as hostage negotiator, but he is not the only one who is interested in the situation, as Mayor of NYC also arrives, and strongly suggests that an ace `fixer' Madeleine White (played by delightfully polite and ice-cold Jodie Foster) should remain there and give a `help' or two to solve some problems. <br /> <br />[PLOT HOLES] I said the film is `clever,' but that doesn't mean the film's script by first-time writer Russell Gewirtz is free from plot holes. I said clever because it succeeds, almost if not perfectly, in covering up the numerous holes in the implausible plot with a taut storytelling of Lee, and the powerhouse acting from the three leads and the good supports such as Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.  <br /> <br />You know, no `clever' robbers would take hostages; in `Inside Man,' however, there is a good reason for the robbers to take hostages, but the reason itself is, if you think about it rationally, highly unlikely. But the film's story remains still entertaining all the same, not by just following the story, but by showing the complexity of the characters. That's why `Inside Man' is most intriguing when it reflects the racial diversity of the city and the country, for example, in the scene where the police get panicky after seeing a man wearing a turban. <br /> <br />But the main attraction of `Inside Man' is its skillful storytelling greatly helped by the top-notch cast. Not that the plot is totally unpredictable for some of you will be able to anticipate the twists in the plot. Moreover, we all know that Jodie's Foster's lawyer (or whatever she is) is only possible because of her good acting. We all know that no one is allowed to behave like her while a serious hostage situation is going on. But like any other good films about the perfect crimes, `Inside Man' requires suspension of disbelief, and much of it, and perhaps it is aware of its defect when it briefly refers to the films like `Serpico' and `Dog Day Afternoon' much more realistic version of police and heist in New York. Still `Inside Man is a very entertaining film as long as you can ignore certain elements in its very convoluted story.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you are from middle America and you like to punch the air to your rock (like 'classic' U2) then this aint for you, don't worry you have plenty of company, most reviewers hated it when it came out becuase it wasn't The Bends II, classic rock filtered down for skinny Middle England. <br />Kid A is beautiful, it's not even wildly 'experimental', it's just a sort of Grimms fairy tales set to music. On a laptop. Oh, then by a rock band (have people really actually listened to this record?)Sure Motion Picture blah blah is a bit sloppy/soppy in places but c'mon these boys had to follow OK Computer...and you know what U2 would have done and it would not have been Kid A.

B00062ZE44|5.0|Being a huge fan of gothic metal bands such as Elis, Midnattsol, Leaves' Eyes and of course Nightwish, I have always wanted to check out Within Temptation but their cds aren't available in the states at regular prices. Thankfully I received a copy of the band's most recent album \\"Silent Force\\" from a friend. I immediately took to the music right away. It definitely goes without saying that Sharon Den Adel has a gorgeous voice. I personally thought her delicate vocals were eerily reminiscent of both Sarah Brightman as well as Liv Kristine of Leaves' Eyes/formerly of Theatre of Tragedy. The music in general is an epic proportion of metal laced with sumptuous goth melodies which often veered off into opera territory at times. I loved all the songs on the cd. All of the songs had a nice balance between the heavy metal guitar riffs and delicate goth melodies.

0312321376|5.0|Dr. Tucker has produced a sensible, straightforward book packed full of real-life evidence.  With an easy narrative, he explains how quantum physics makes the possibilities real.  There are more than forty years of research of over 2,500 children, in which Dr. Tucker gleams stories, both coincidental and precise, to support the very possibility of reincarnation.  Dr. Tucker was trained as a pediatric psychiatrist and takes a very fresh look at this contentious subject.  The book is very pragmatic and scientific in its approach of the subject.  Some of the stories will make your hair stand on end, but one gets a real sense that reincarnation is not fantasy, but reality.
B00005JOQS|4.0|Never mind the plot rehash, it's been rehashed through 150 reviews already, and the \\"Superman\\" genre was never about plot anyway.  The Man of Steel has been around saving the planet since 1939 and he's back, after a five-year hiatus, to do more of the same.  Nothing much new there.  But there have been some interesting character changes and two of them are noteworthy.<br /><br />First of all is Brandon Routh as Superman.  Even before Christopher Reeve's tragic accident, he had run his course in this role; the films had gone downhill after the second movie and hit rock bottom in \\"Superman IV\\".  But Reeve was so perfect in the part; he looked exactly how everyone ever imagined Superman must look like, and one could only wonder if anyone could ever fill Reeves boots in this sequel.  But just as Richard Donner used a then-unknown Reeve in \\"Superman\\", Brian Singer wisely cast another unknown in this film, and Brandon Routh is a very good Superman indeed.  He looks every bit as much the character as Reeves did and his acting in the part is just as good.  He doesn't need to fill Reeve's boots; he wears his own Superman boots very well.<br /><br />The second important character change is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  I thought Spacey was great in this role, much better than Gene Hackman.  Hackman played Luthor for laughs; Spacey plays the part for pure evil menace, much as Superman's creator intended.  Spacey plays Luthor to the hilt, gleefully pulling every trick in the book to destroy his nemesis and almost succeeding.  He and Routh are two great reasons to go see this film.<br /><br />The other actors give creditable performances, especially Frank Langella as the editor of the Daily Planet; I liked him better in that role than Jackie Cooper.  The plot is predictable; we know Superman will save the day, so what else is new?  What blows us out of our shoes in this production is the jaw-dropping, eye-popping experience of watching it in IMAX-3D.  The special effects are so incredible in IMAX that you feel like you're literally falling out of your seat right into the screen.  There's almost no way to describe it; it has to be experienced to believe it.  I'm still wondering, though, why Singer chose to shoot some, but not all scenes in 3D, which means you have to keep putting on and taking off your 3D glasses as the scene changes demand, but maybe watching the whole film in 3D might be too much of a sensory overload.  All I can tell you is that once you've seen this movie in IMAX, you'll never want to see it in any other format.  No, I'm not waiting for the DVD.  A DVD would be a flat letdown after seeing this movie in an IMAX theater.<br /><br />What \\"Superman Returns\\" adds up to is a fun movie.  There's been a lot of serious analysis of Superman as some kind of Messiah figure in this film, saving the world and mankind from the evil machinations of Lex Luthor and his dastardly henchmen.  Please.  Superman has never been other than a comic book figure and he still isn't.  But he's great fun to watch, and the IMAX production is a mind-blowing experience you won't forget in a hurry.

B00005JMXX|3.0|... and sleeting, and snowing, and hailing, and storming, and the sky is falling, etc. Yeah, okay, it's a fun movie, and the first hour or so is a visual joyride. They didn't miss a trick.  Everybody has their own favorite scene in this movie, whether it's the tornado shredding the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, or hail the size of soccer balls falling on the beach in Malibu, or the rainfall guysering up through the manholes in Manhattan... my own favorite is the giant wave about to engulf the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor and getting ready to flood out all of the Lower East Side and midtown. The first hour of this film is a special effects fanatic's delight.<br /><br />And a good thing, too, because once the special effects are done, what's left of the movie falls flatter than the proverbial pancake. Alas, Roland Emmerich never realized that great special effects do not a great movie make. Once the deep freeze outside is on, the movie freezes up as well. We've heard it all before -- the lone, unregarded scientist, preaching doom and gloom, ignored until too late; his super-bright, nerdy kid who solves complicated calculus problems in his head, competing for the cute coed against the rich kid from the Ivies... is there a cliche that Emmerich forgot to add to this film? Well, the general plot line is interesting, if not altogether original -- global warming leading to a global deep freeze, although this time the deep freeze happens in days, not centuries (there's progress for ya!), but the \\"human interest\\" side plots add absolutely nothing to the script and are at best a big yawn and at worst just plain irritating. The acting is adequate, but just barely. The rain, snow and hail have more personality than the actors.<br /><br />If Emmerich thought he was giving us a deep film that would sound a global alarm on the dangers of global warming, he's too full of himself to be taken seriously. As if anyone would take this movie seriously. It's a fun movie, and taken as such, it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV. Kick back with a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy.a fun way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV. Kick back with a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Great special effects and hot Kate Beckinsale are not quite enough to make this movie a smash hit.

I mean \\"Jon Voight\\" as the president, what are they thinking?
B000GCFO0I|4.0|This was an awesome movie, but did have a few flaws I admit. I did play all the games and love them and I also love the movie. While the movie is a sort of messy combination of the games and a number of new aspects of Silent Hill, it still gives you the same feel and experience that Silent Hill is supposed to. There's a period of intense environments and monsters (when Rose is in 'Hell') and a sort of breather period where things are calmer (when Rose is exploring in 'Purgatory'). <br /> <br />Now I've read alot of reviews for this film and I must say I'm disappointed by some of the reasons why people disliked this film. For example, so many people have pointed out that cops don't wear pants that tight............IT'S A MOVIE!!!!!! Who cares about something as mundane as the pants anybody wears? People need to learn to take the right things seriously. <br /> <br />Okay, that aside I have a few flaws to point out. <br />First, the monsters. They are all awesome, but there were hardly any in the film, they were all seen once (or twice in Pyramid Head's case) and never seen again. In the games, there are creatures crowding the streets of Silent Hill. <br />Second, the nurses. They were done perfectly. I loved their personality and how they move. The only problem is that they were clumped into a huge group when they could have been creeping around the basement of the hospital. It could have been really creepy, around every turn hidden in every shadow, instead of a lame huddle of nurses. <br />Third, the lame dialogue. This is one thing I agree with the people who gave this film bad reviews. It's rather unimpressive. In one scene Anna spoke something about the first burning and a scene or two later Cybil says \\"I think there was a fire here\\".......I saw this movie with my friends and we all had the same \\"'Ya think?\\" reaction to that. There are other scenes too, but this was probably the worst. <br />Fourth, the husband. Sean Bean's character is pointless in this film andcould possibly been in the film so that they could squeeze out a Silent Hill 2 with him being James. This is just a suggestion I've heard before, but it would be interesting to see how they would do that. <br />And finally, the cult. They changed it dramatically from the believable super creepy, drug pushing cult of the video game and turned it into a random group of stupid people griping about burning witches. Sorry, but this cult is a few hundred years out of place. The cult in the games have their own set of Gods and beliefs, not to mention the different sects of the cult. The cult of the first game worship a god called Samael, some members in SH3 worship Metatron, and some worship Valtiel, for example. In Silent Hill the cult got the town addicted to the drug so they could brain wash it's citizens, whom would believe what the cult wanted as long as they continued to supply their drugs. <br /> <br />There are probably more flaws that I'm forgetting, but here's some kudos for the film: <br />1. I loved the music. <br />2. It had the same sound effects as the games. <br />3. The siren was really brought to life in the film. <br />4. The transition between the two worlds was really cool. <br />5. Did I mention the monsters? <br />6. The alleyway scene involving the grey children was just like the game. <br />7. The fog. <br />8. The cult was killed (I really hated them). <br /> <br />Overall, it's difficult for me to write a review where there are so many details about the film that either improves it or makes it worse. For this film, the good outweigh the bad. The overall feel of the town and atmosphere is something original to the world of Silent Hill and it definately feels that way in the film. I recommend this film to anybody who likes intelligent, psychological horror films that don't give it all away.
0679777547|4.0|The Club Dumas is a what many call a high-brow mystery book, where the pages turn fast but the subject matter is a few steps above the standard smoking gun \\"whodunit?\\". The book cover claims it as a \\"beach book for intellectuals.\\" While this might be a bit overwrought, it's also fairly accurate, as The Club Dumas doesn't pander to a low-brow audience. Instead, it maintains a high level of sophistication while remaining a standard thrilling mystery. In the end, it may try to mix 2 moods that don't necessarily blend well together. But it does such a good job that you can't help but be entertained.  <br /> <br />Having prefaced with that, there's more to the story than a vapid tale such as The DaVinci Code. The story has layers which make it more intricate than any run of the mill American thriller, translating into a mystery almost impossible to figure out. I don't read books trying to figure out what might happen, so take that for what it's worth. I suppose seasoned mystery might not be so stumped. Or maybe they will. I digress. <br /> <br />The Club Dumas is about one chapter from Dumas' original manuscript of The Three Musketeers, and the search to find out if the chapter is authentic or not. On top of this, the main character Luca Corso is saddled with the burden of finding out if another, apparently unrelated, book is also authentic. This second book is an ancient text purported to be able to instruct the reader how to summon the devil. Much of the narrative centers around the hobby - passion perhaps is a better word - of collecting original manuscripts of books through the centuries. The working knowledge Perez-Reverte exhibits about book collecting is what really sets this apart from your standard thriller. Corso finds himself taken through the ringer as he tries to figure out how these 2 mysteries are interwoven. Through several near misses he finds himself playing a role in a real life version of Dumas' grand work. <br /> <br />How it all plays out is left asan exercise to the reader. Despite claims that Perez-Reverte tied up the book brilliantly, I can't agree with that. There are parts of the wrap-up that go outside the believable bounds of the narrative. Because of this I can't say the book does well in bringing the story to a proper close. To elucidate that thought, imagine having read a story only to find a talking dog at the end of a book where dogs never talked. It would be problematic, to suggest such an ending.  <br /> <br />Perhaps Perez-Reverte uses the talking dog widget, perhaps he doesn't. I have to admit parts of the ending are left extremely vague. In my online searches I have not found anyone who has taken a stab at summarizing what exactly happens to all involved. Instead, we are left with an amorphous ooze of uncertainty. Perhaps this is the literary hangover the beach intellectual feels when they've drank more intellectual words than they can handle? <br /> <br />Regardless, the bulk of the book is nearly brilliant. I have already bought 2 more works by the same author, as I found this book nearly impossible to put down for the 3-4 days it took me to read. Even if the end wasn't as well done as the rest of the book, it still stands as an excellent work and I fully understand how this ranks as an international best seller. This isn't 5 star material for the reasons cited above. But this is a solid 4 star book that will keep you riveted, at least until the end, where you might find yourself blown away, or a little confused. Either way it's worth the trip getting there.
B000B5XOXY|2.0|This Batman movie is one of the worst Batman movies.  Although The movie suffers from a super silly feel, I still think it might be better than the melodramatic Batman Begins.  Val Kilmar is the worst Batman ever.  Not bad special effects in this 90's movie.  The Batman franchise died with this movie.  The only two good batman movies are Batman and Batman Returns.  Although this movie stinks, it has good special features.  Music videos, making of docs, interviews, dleted scenes: it has all the works.  I would pick it up only if you are a huge Batman fan and want to add it to your collection but otherwise I would just save my money.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Buy this movie. AND read the book. The movie is very beautiful and I personally love to watch it on a regular basis, but the script takes huge liberties with history. Although this is really masterful film making in many respects, the actual story in the book is more interesting, more complex, and we get to find out what happened to these actual people after their Seabiscuit collaberation ended. The whole tale is one worth knowing.<br /><br />  Unlike the Jeff Bridges character, Seabiscuits' owner was an acomplished horseman who attended military school and served in the cavalry. Didn't see that in the movie... And most movies based on history leave out an awful lot. None of us will sit through a six hour show. So just remember that you never get accuracy from Hollywood, you get a great show. There's a difference.<br /><br />  Gone With The Wind has the same injustice done to it; The movie is a romantic pastiche while the book is astonishingly different. Might wanna read that one too.<br /><br />  If you ever rode or spent any time at the track you'll need a fix of this movie periodicly just to see the magnificent racing scenes, so just keep it on the shelf. Get the letterbox one... Just georgeous!
B000AU9UYM|1.0|I hated this movie.  Its not fleshed out, its just plain terrible.  Although I still fully believe that Val Kilmer was the worst Batman, Christian Bale is the second worst.  He whisper acts.  Also he seems more like a actor than Bruce Wayne.  He plays both with such a dullness about him, almost as if he does not really care.  The story is about a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about finding the path of justice and blah blah blah.  We are talking about a Batman FRANCHISE, not a Shakespearian Play.  This is just a summer blockbuster.  The morals are what barney should have taught you.  This movie (not film) does not need to be o-so-moral or even o-so-serious.  It should at least have a little fun.  To me the movie is just a male version of Elektra.  It has the same bad editing, the same \\"flashback to my tragic childhood\\" cut scenes, the same \\"I can take on 15 people at the same time because I'm just that good\\" action, but most of all, it has the same \\"I'm going to fool people into thinking that melodrama is what makes movie good\\" wishful thinking.  The movie tests my patience and tries to treat me like a idiot.  It was just a big pile of dung.  Bruce Wayne has never been such a complete moron with zero common sense.  One of the worst parts is that the movie contradicts itself.  For example:  Bruce Wayne's mentor tells him in one scene that his father is to blame for his own death because even though he has no skill he never acted to save himself and that its not strength that is needed for survival but the ability to try.  In the very next scene the same guy says that Bruce is so much stronger than his father and that's why he is a survivor.  That really makes no sense.  Another example is how Bruce wont kill anyone because its against his moral code but literally 5 seconds later he kills a whole building full of people without blinking.  The only voice of reason in this movie is not Alfred, but Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes.  She keeps trying to tell people what they literally need to hear (especially Bruce), but nobody ever pays any attention to her and instead just gets all bent out of shape by what she has to say.  Also, the batmobile was the worst ever!  It was like a pancake shaped, junkyard made, jeep with a roof.  It was short and stubby.  It drove like a pogo stick.  It was so ugly. It seemed so redneck to me.  It was like a mini monster truck and I fully expected Joe Dirt to jump out with a beer in one hand and a package of cheewing tabacoo in the other.  I loved the first 2 batman's and even Forever and Batman & Robin were silly campy fun, but now I probably will never see a batman movie ever again.need to hear (especially Bruce), but nobody ever pays any attention to her and instead just gets all bent out of shape by what she has to say.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|Team America - World Police is a very funny, yet immature movie. The film is an idea that hatched from the creators of South Park (Trey Parker and Matt Stone), and follows the same slap stick comedy that South Park is known for. The thing that really separates this movie from others in the slap stick genre is the fact the entire movie is done with puppets. The use of puppets takes this movie to a different level of funny. To add to the hilarity of the puppets movement are the songs, these songs are perfectly placed to keep the laughs going throughout the entire movie. The following conversation has to be the funniest of the movie:<br /><br />Lisa: Promise me you'll never die.<br /><br />Gary Johnson: You know I can't promise that.<br /><br />Lisa: If you did that, I would make love to you right now.<br /><br />Gary Johnson: I promise I'll never die.<br /><br />The scene directly after this is of the two puppets, Lisa and Gary, making puppet love. That line coupled with the puppet love sequence is just hysterical. The ending of the movie is also a great sequence, the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.), is used a lot, but only by the acronym. The last story that is used by Gary to win over the crowd is one that Gary picked up in a bar, with a few slight altercations, is one of the funnier, yet vile and inappropriate, dialogues that I have ever heard. Overall I do think this movie is aimed at a younger demographic and that many adults, such as my dad, would deem this movie as unwatchable.<br /><br />The movie definitely deserves its R rating due to the excessive language and puppet violence. Although the language can be a bit much at times, it is something that South Park is known for and Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to duplicate the South Park style. The thing with a movie like this is that people will either love it or hate it, and I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Brian Bowen
1400079179|2.0|Why has this been so popular?  As far as thriller plots go, it's mediocre and rather farfetched.  The characters are two-dimensional.  The writing style is not the least bit creative or literary.  The accounts of religious and art history are spurious.  The puzzles and word games provide entertaining diversions, but they don't outweigh the book's other deficiencies.  In straddling several genres, the book has apparently attracted a broad readership.  (The religious controversy it stirred up didn't hurt either.)  But I doubt that many have walked away thrilled.<br /><br />For a monastic literary mystery, try The Name of the Rose.  For simple excitement, go for something like Michael Crichton or Harry Potter.  But don't bother with this.
0804106304|5.0|My mother was brought up very traditionally by my grandfather (who was from China), whereas I had a Western education and am currently living in the UK.  This book speaks to me - almost every clash of culture written in the book between mother and daughter happened with me; the language barriers, the difference in thinking.  I cried throughout the book and the movie because Amy Tan had managed to put all of it down so accurately.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Within minutes after I heard this CD had been released, I owned a copy!  And, I was not disappointed.  Because it seems more country than folk, it will probably not get a huge air-play.   <br /> <br />Both artists individually are outstanding, and together they are terriffic.  Emmylou has not been called \\"the queen of harmony\\" for no reason.

0553260111|4.0|I really loved this book. It was one of those that is hard to put down - full of suspense - all that. I would highly recommend it - and I don't always get into the \\"spy\\" genre but this one is definitely enjoyable. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book so much that I looked forward to the movie starring Matt Damon - BUT I was very disappointed. Some of the really cool plot twists that made the book so unique and thrilling were not included in the movie. I kept wondering how they could even consider following up the first movie with the sequels when the movie got the whole premise of who Bourne turns out to be so wrong. I guess they just couldn't keep up with the plot twists in the movie? I don't know, but I wish they'd tried. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong - watching the movie knowing nothing about the book, it is a strong action/thriller. My husband loved it. But having read the book it just ruined the movie for me. So my recommendation for anyone reading the book - enjoy it! It's wonderful. But don't have high expectations for the movie to be a close representation. <br /> <br />Maybe watching the movie first is the better way to go - but that might just be confusing since who Bourne is turns out so differently. Either way - enjoy both book and movie - just give yourself sufficient space between them.

0440419514|5.0|I received this trilogy by accident through one of my book clubs (I had forgotten to cancel the monthly selection)... I was too lazy to send it back, so I picked up the first book and began reading it.  Within a few paragraphs, I was hooked; I devoured the first one and plunged right into the next... and then the last... and they are still three of my favorite books.<br /><br />The first book is set in a fantasy world that is kind of like a version of our world in the past, if the Catholic church had gone a different course; the main character is Lyra, an adventurous tomboy... the second book is set in our world, or one very similar, and features as it's main character Will, a quietly heroic young boy who is looking out for his mother in the midst of some very strange events... and the last book brings the two worlds and heros together seamlessly.<br /><br />The characters are extraordinarily dynamic, the writing descriptive, and the plot fantastic.  The story sucks you in and keeps you moving right along with the characters.<br /><br />For adults, this novel offers an elegantly written, fast paced adventure with political undertones and commentary on the role of organized religion in modern society.  There is also romantic tension, and the particular stirrings of love that can only be felt by children about to lose their innocence by entering puberty -- tottering on that fine line between childhood and not-quite-a-child/not-quite-an-adult.  Pullman captures these emotions better than any other children's writer I've found.<br /><br />For kids, this is pure fantasy and adventure at it's finest.  My 5 year old has listened to these stories on audiobook with us and loved them, and has begun reading the books with me at bedtime.  Although a lot of the heavier ideas behind the plotline escape him, he still enjoys the adventure and the thrill of hiding in closets... jumping across rooftops... and joining Gypsies on their riverboats... not to mention everything else that goes on!<br /><br />I highly recommend this set!  I wish there was more to read bout these characters.se that goes on! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this set!  I wish there was more to read bout these characters.

The production is very distinctive and very edgy, but still the sound we love from Eminem. But on this cd Eminem takes a different approach then just the homo gestures and the obscenities, he has more of a political view since President Bush was elected like on the song \\"Square Dance\\", and referring to 9/11 on \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\".

B00000JGOJ|5.0|While this movie wasn't deep-arguably that is-it was creative, unique, and quite realistic. If you pay close attention to the dialogue it can be predictable especially if you like to figure things out before they happen. Willard Carroll left just enough room to make you wonder and then certain revelations-unless you're out of it-are expected and not surprising. The characters were believable and the acting by the entire cast was nothing short of sensational.<br /><br />If you get confused easily, stick it out, comes together very nicely in the end.<br /><br />Side note-two things:<br /><br />1. How excellent that Gillian Anderson had the ability to show range. Don't get me wrong, love Dana Scully, I do, however, she is an unsung hero when it comes to this art. (See her in Masterpiece Theater's Bleak House.)<br /><br />2. It is in my opinion that most comedians stick to comedy and there are but a few when they transition or give drama a try do an excellent job. Having said that hats off to Jon Stewart. His performance was more than respectable.

0201485672|5.0|One of my clients went through a refactoring project last year and recently this project has been revived to see if it can be incorporated with an SOA project that I am now involved with. Studying how to design services for a legacy environment while also lookint at refactoring some of the existing legacy components we have in place raised a lot of issues. <br /> <br />I won't bore you with the details of our project but I will mention that this book was very helpful in nailing down exactly what our options to refactoring are. It focuses a lot on theory and has some insight as to where this trend is going. I learned that refactoring  is *not* extending as much as it is improving what you already have. <br /> <br />If you're interested in refactoring from a project point of view, then this is a great resource.
B00004Y6NT|2.0|This is Dire Straits' second album and is the weakest of all tHEIR ALBUMS along with Alchemy and BBC. This one only has 1 in Lady Writer which is great. But still worth to buy even though it's the weakest.

B00027JYLC|4.0|A 1932 film directed by Tod Browning, who had major success with the film Dracula. He wanted to top Frankenstein. You can judge if he succeeded or not. This film was considered controversial and was banned in Britain for many years. It might today even be considered shocking to some because of the use of real sideshow performers as actors. Tod took a major risk when he made this film and I thank him for that, for its rare to find such a gem like this in the history of cinema.<br /><br />This is a tale of false love and revenge. A story about a beautiful woman who tries to con a midget and poison him for his money...but ends up very sorry for her actions. Her and her partner seem to think its funny to make fun of all the ''freaks'', until she goes too far one night at dinner then the Freaks later discover her ulterior motives against ''one of their own kind'' and she ends up paying the ultimate price.<br /><br />We get to know all of the Freaks quite well. We are introduced to Violet & Daisy Hilton, a pair of siamese twins, 2 brother and sister who are midgets, human skeletons, armless girl, a man with no arms or legs yet he can roll a cigarette with his mouth and many more interesting characters. The scene you will most likely never forget is when the freaks turn against the woman at the end and the storm chase scene.<br /><br />This is not an exploitation film. Browning treats them with great compassion. It presents them in human terms. He knew how to do that, he at one point, during his teenage years ran away to join the circus and got to know many of the people. Now they will be remembered forever in the history of cinema.<br /><br />The special features on the DVD are fascinating.<br /><br />The Film contains commentary by David J. Skal, Author of Dark Carnival: The Secret World of Tod Browning, Hollywood's Master of the Macabre.<br /><br />All-New Documentary Freaks: Sideshow Cinema where we learn all about the actors and people behind the movie.<br /><br />Special Message Prologue added for Theatrical Reissue<br /><br />3 Alternate Endings.<br /><br />I have to say is this film stands the test of time and even after 70 years this film is quite effective.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. 4.5 Starsal Message Prologue added for Theatrical Reissue  <br />3 Alternate Endings. <br /> <br />I have to say is this film stands the test of time and even after 70 years this film is quite effective. <br />Highly Recommended. 4.5 Stars <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|What kind of overrated pop band is Green Day? They are super overrated with all I hear is guitars. There is not even 1 guitar <br />solo in this album, it is just lousy. Even Boulevard Of Broken Dreams is overrated as their crappy new single. Green Day is now <br />over, stop reviewing this terrible item everyone, go hide this in the closet in your room right now.
B00006JKON|5.0|THE BAND: Ian Anderson (vocals, flute, acoustic guitar, sax), Martin Barre (electric & spanish guitars), Jeffrey Hammond (bass), John Evan (piano, organ, synth), Barriemore Barlow (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1974) 10 tracks clocking in at approximately 39 minutes. This (2002) digital remaster adds 7 bonus tracks coming in at just under 65 minutes. This is Tull's 8th album. Included with the disc is a booklet containing assorted pictures, song lyrics and thank you's. All songs written by Anderson - and his first producing an entire album himself. The back side of the album cover contains images of people (pertaining to the song titles) featuring band members & crew, girlfriends, and/or current wives, including Anderson's future wife (the circus ring leader near the sealion). Label - Chrysalis Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This album is oddly sandwiched between two very heavy albums, \\"A Passion Play\\" (1973) and \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" (1975). \\"Warchild\\" is a much lighter release... almost whimsical... covering topics on society, religion and the music critics themselves (\\"Only Solitaire\\" allegedly aimed at L.A. Times rock music critic Robert Hilburn, who was one of Anderson's harsher critics). Songs take on a short and light (almost comical) approach; as compared to the deep and lengthy songs the listening public is used to hearing. \\"Warchild\\" was an album originally slated to be a movie soundtrack - it went onto reach #2 on the Billboard charts. \\"Bungle In The Jungle\\" would become Tull's biggest U.S. single. The longest song is \\"Back Door Angels\\" at a mere five-and-a-half minutes - a far cry from past albums containing only 1-2-3 songs on the entire album. The album starts off in great fashion with the title track... sound effects of a husband and wife talking and sipping tea, the husband walking outside only to be blasted by bombs and screaming sirens. The title track starts out slow, but rocks through a majority of it - my favorite on the disc. My 2nd favorite tune is the acoustic \\"Ladies\\", complete with hand claps, flute and orchestra arrangements. The prettiest song is the other acoustic track,\\" Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The New Day\\" (arguably one of the longer song titles in rock/progressive music). \\"The Third Hoorah\\" is an almost danceable melody and halfway through becomes a reprise of the title track. The only forgettable track in my opinion is \\"Sealion\\". Jethro Tull has been master of the long song; with \\"Warchild\\", Anderson & Co. put their best short songs together for a classic album (4.5 stars).<br /><br />Anyone interested in the name \\"Jethro Tull\\"?

B00004Y6NU|4.0|This is actully not a bad album from Dire Straits. But slower. <br />The best songs on this are Industrien Disease, and It Never Rains <br />which are brillant and rock. Telegraph Road is good but too long <br />and slow. Go buy it mostly for those 2 and get this with all the Dire Straits before Alchemy or BBC. Thanks.
B000EZ7ZYA|3.0|The movie is good. This review is about the transfer to HD. <br /> <br />Sometimes the picture looks great and are obviously HD, but other times it's just plain ugly and DVD quality or less. <br /> <br />This is very obvious (i'm not a videophile, just an ordinary guy with money to blow on blu-ray) because the quality changes many times during a single scene, changing based on the camera angle. <br /> <br />So you end up with a shot of will smith that looks awesome, and then suddenly there's a shot of someone else that looks terrible, then it's back to will smith and looking good, then the camera changes back to the horrible looking image. <br /> <br />It's still better than the DVD, but it's not what it could or should be. <br /> <br />It's a shame that the movie is not up to par because the early adopters of this technology are the least price sensitive, but the most likely to notice poor quality. <br /> <br />Go ahead and charge a fortune for the movies, but at least make them the best possible. Sadly, the high price combined with the poor HD transfer make the offerings unattractive to both the early adopters as well as more general consumers. <br /> <br />There's a decent chance a Sony exec of some kind will read this, and if so, I hope you have the cajones to do what it takes to make your media platform a success. You will ultimately fail if you can't deliver on the promise.
B000F9RB9Y|1.0|I liked THE TERMINATOR when I originally saw it. I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. However, returning to the subject of this format it seems to be not what it was touted to be. Unfortunately this Blu-ray disc seems to bring out the imperfections from the master print or whatever print they used to copy THE TERMINATOR onto this disc. I found the picture very annoying to watch because of this. I can only give this product 1 star for that reason.
B00005JOQS|3.0|Two things to start off: First, I think this film deserves three and a half stars as opposed to 3, but Amazon doesn't allow half-star ratings, and I feel that it is closer to a three than a four.  Second, this is the only Superman movie that I have seen the complete film the whole way through.  I have seen the beginning and ending of Superman II as well as a scene from the original Superman, but that is it. <br />Anyway, Superman Returns serves as a sequel to the first two Superman films, effectively erasing the canonicity of the third and fourth films (which is probably a good thing).  After astronomers claimed that they found the location of Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) felt that he needed to see the remains of his home for himself and left Earth for 5 years.  In that time, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from jail, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has found a new lover, won a Pulitzer for an article called \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\", and even had a son. <br />Upon his return to Earth, Superman finds that he has been missed by the public as well as by Lois, despite what she has said.  Immediately he is off saving people again, while his alter ego Clark Kent gets his job back at the Daily Planet.  He is upset that Lois is now engaged to Richard White (James Mardsen), the nephew of the Planet's editor Perry White (Frank Langella), but he that pales in comparison to the revelation that Lois is now a mother.  The kid, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), is one of the film's low points, as his point in the plot is only to cause Clark angst and then (mild spoiler warning) help Lois out of some trouble. <br />Luthor's overall scheme once again has to do with real estate, but it doesn't seem as maniacal as the one he used in the first film (despite not seeing it, I know what his plan was).  It's true that he would once again cause numerous deaths and would amass a lot of power, I just couldn't buy into it. <br />Overall, the movie had some very strong pointsand some very weak points.  Some of the strong points included the effects as well as some of the scenes of Superman's exploits that didn't have to do with Luthor's plot.  However, some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy (\\"I forgot how warm you are!\\"), Routh lacks the charisma to effectively portray Superman, Bosworth doesn't appear to have any chemistry with any of the men in her life (that includes Supes, Richard, and Jason), and, as earlier stated, the threat just doesn't seem to be as menacing as Luthor makes it out to be.  Furthermore, I found a few inconsistencies towards the end that have to do with Superman's reaction to kryptonite, but I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say what they are. <br />Maybe I just set myself up too much for this film.  I am a fan of Bryan Singer's work, and not just his work on his other superhero films.  While his two X-Men films are good (X2 is superb in my opinion), The Usual Suspects (also starring Kevin Spacey) is cinematic bliss, and House, which he executive produces, is a great medical drama.  Yet I was underwhelmed by this film, and I feel part of the reason is that Singer tried so hard to call back to the previous Superman films that he didn't infuse enough his his own vision into this one. <br />It's too bad; this was shaping up to be the must-see film of the summer, but I (along with a sizable number of critics) left the theater feeling that that title will now go to the Pirates of the Caribbean sequel.
0393061310|4.0|You may not have seen them, but lurking out there in the highways and byways is a tribe of scholars who believe that everything you presume about the way humans make history happen is, well, rubbish. Most of them do not write scintillating narrations of a grand theory that falls well on the deterministic side of center, as grand theories go.<br /><br />But Jared Diamond does. That's a good thing.<br /><br />Diamond's affection for the New Guinea tribal people who have befriended him during his field research places an endearing frame around a dissertation that might otherwise have seemed rather unfeeling. Indeed, the programmatic question of one of them--hereafter to be known as 'Yali's question'--serves as the spinal chord of these nearly five hundred pages:'Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'<br /><br />Now there's a big question. Diamond thinks it can be answered.<br /><br />Tongue lodged in cheek, Diamond opens his preface to the book's paperback edition with this sentence: 'This book attempts to provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years.' Upon review, however, Diamond's statement is not entirely jocular. It actually describes with unusual clarity the book he has placed in many thousands of readers' hands. His evidence may be limited--so the word 'attempts'--yet he is happy to admit such and still press on with what might turn out to be an early attempt at an ecological-geographical theory of history that will eventually produce more sophisticated and convincing successors. This is one of the ways that science proceeds or advances--you choose the verb, depending on your methodological persuasion. When it is self-correcting, as Diamond in his most prudent moments trusts that it will be, this is not a way to do science. Or history. Or whichever best approximates to the task Diamond has set for himself and, fortunately, for our over-his-shoulder curiosity.<br /><br />A man of Diamond's convictions is bound to consider the hunters-and-gathers, missionaries, academics, and historians whom me meets upon the way as distinctively naïve. Still, to his credit, he does not regard them as dangerously naïve. Instead, he utilizes a generous dollup of case studies to open our eyes to how preexisting conditions set the course of human histories in a way that ought to be considered to complex for responsible investigation and conceptualization.<br /><br />Diamond tells a good story. He is clearly warm to his topic and it does not require much effort to be affected by his contagious enthusiasm. I found his concluding 'The Future of Human History as a Science', replete as his meditations are with sensitivity to the reality that different phenomena require distinct methodologies if they are to be understood.<br /><br />Still, I can't help but suspect that--regardless of the the author's caveats--the driving conviction behind his method is deterministic and overly dismissive of factors like individual personality and religious ideology independent of any determining elements that might have brought it into just the shape it has at any moment.<br /><br />Still, let's take him at his word. Considerations that can perhaps best be labeled ecological largely set the stage for what is possible in human history and humanity's future. It is then up to us what we make of it.<br /><br />This might not be a general theory of everything our race, in its global context, experiences. But it's an interesting and competent stab at a piece of it, well written and effectively framed.houlder curiosity. <br /> <br />A man of Diamond's convictions is bound to consider the hunters-and-gathers, missionaries, academics, and historians whom me meets upon the way as distinctively naïve.

It is then up to us what we make of it. <br /> <br />This might not be a general theory of everything our race, in its global context, experiences. But it's an interesting and competent stab at a piece of it, well written and effectively framed.
006054094X|4.0|... and completes with proves. <br />What Menzies' wonderful book provided with us is a great theory, and that is enough to deserve compliments. It's up to those similarly brave hearts and curious minds to prove it. <br />Einstein's Theory of Relativity remained a mere theory for almost a decade before the proof was there. Einstein was also famous for proposing incorrect theories (e.g. against the then-emerging Quantum Theory). However, no one would nor should discredit Einstein for his unsubstantiated theories.  <br />As a physical scientist myself, I found those attacks on Menzies' theory dispicable, simply because the attackers were able to find the missing links here and there in the book. <br />For all us humans, there are more unknowns than the knowns. What Menzies' book reveal is exactly that: there remains to be more unknowns than the knowns. However, is there anyone here able to provide a more credible theory that could explain for the pre-Columbian maps, the relics of advanced alien cultures, etc. etc.. <br />I don't think anyone who read the first 1/3 of the book should have much question. Much of that is well known history. Those who question the entire book because their own ignorance of that history simply do not deserve a say on this panel. <br />After that, Menzies is fairly convincing and persuasive in taking us down the coast of Monzambique, around the Cape, and up the Atlantic coast of Africa. <br />As everyone else, I started to \\"lose\\" it a little bit after Cape Verde, and down the cost of Argentina. However, this is not Menzies' fault, he's not meant to be there to provide us with all the answeres, he's there to provide us with the awareness of all the unanswered questions. This is where I think the true value of the book is, it's truly thought-provoking to read the remaining chapters, and struggle to connect the dots. Those discernible eyes will find a real gold mine where others found a heap of rubbish.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|In Dangermouse and Cee-Lo Green you have two artists you don't know the word boundary and when they decide to join forces to release an album its a scary thing. I was caught off guard by their 1st single \\"Crazy\\" which besides the title was not way out there, in fact I was initially dissapointed by the song but as it grew in popularity it started to grow on me as well. I also started to think that perhaps the rest of the album would not be too leftfield but I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />The opening track launches into hodge podge of rock/go-go/electro/gospel & soul with Cee-Lo proclaiming his freedom. From this moment you know that all your fears were justified. Although with \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel\\" it works well mainly because the sound is rooted in Gospel which is easy to relate to. Elsewhere on St. Elsewhere Cee-Lo & Dangermouse really push the envelope with varying results. \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" sounds like a pop-rock experiment  that goes terribly wrong. \\"The Boogie Monster\\" is straight out of  the Addams Family vaults and it leaves you scratching your head a little bit. \\"Transformer\\" sounds like a sequel to the opening track without the gospel. It doesn't quite do it for me. No matter though because at an average of 2mins 20seconds these tracks are over before you can reach the skip button.<br /><br />Besides those few missteps the rest of St. Elsewhere's experiments work well. The title track is a beautiful that sounds like something you've heard before but can't place. \\"The Storm Coming\\" is Dangermouse at his best, \\"Smiley Faces\\" is a throwback that will have you headnodding without you even knowing.<br /><br />Dnagermouse is on a roll of late and he is likely to get all the cudo's for this album but in truth Cee-Lo's voice and his song writing are what really hold this album together. It doesn't matter how weird a beat Mouse throws at him, he is able to transform it into a wonderful song. The song concepts are as far out as the beats but Cee-Lo is also able to deliver something down to earth at the same time.<br /><br />The album takes a few listens to get into but ultimately it works well<br /><br />The cover art on the album is appropriate as the two have created an explosive colour filled soundscape that defies definition.  Dangermouse scores another winner and in what is likely to be the first of three high profile collabos for Cee-Lo (The other two with Jazzy Pha & Jack Splash respectively), he has set the bar very high indeed.is also able to deliver something down to earth at the same time. <br /> <br />The album takes a few listens to get into but ultimately it works well <br /> <br />The cover art on the album is appropriate as the two have created an explosive colour filled soundscape that defies definition.

B00005OMTT|4.0|Here is the compilation of Enigma's greatest hits from Enigma I to Enigma IV (1990-2000). Any Enigma lover will not be disappointed with this release: The same powerful sounds, arranged in different order than could be expected. Starts with the new \\"Turn around\\", goes on with \\"Gravity of love\\" and it is not until ninth track when you can enjoy the first hit from Enigma I (Principles of lust) This little mess does not help a newcomer to Enigma world getting the fantastic sensations of listening to Enigma music. So, that's why I think it is more recommendable for Enigma old folks. <br /> <br />The new single, \\"Turn around\\", is impressive and fantastic, in the line of \\"Gravity of love\\" or even \\"Morphing Throu Time\\". <br /> <br />CD covers are designed in Enigma way with ancient pictures and cryptic statements. <br /> <br />To sum up, a collectionist edition for Enigma lovers. If you are not familiar with Enigma yet, you'd better start in the right order: by getting Enigma I and then II, etc. A slower and more expensive path, but Enigma music will pay it off.
B00004Z400|4.0|Upon purchasing this Cd, a few have being raving it as the 'best metal Cd yet'. Thus judging on their prized taste in music i've succumbed and bought it. At first listens tracks like 'back to school', 'digital bath', 'elite' and 'change' certainly succeeded in making the money spent worthwhile.  <br />However with the word of mouth advertising did not hold up to expectations with this Cd. True the musical content at times can be sonically orgasmic with 'digital bath' and others mentioned, but at first what really made this album weak for myself was the 'lyrics heard' like 'heres my new address 665' taken from street carp and others like 'you're my girl and thats, alright' taken from Rx queen. Lyrics like these really irriiated me, but after reading the 'real lyrics' it did make sense in its own context. Thus makin it from 3 stars to 4. <br />In reagards to 'the best metal album' ive yet listened to one, this Cd is good but that is all that can be said. <br /> <br />
B000002H97|4.0|I am a true heavy metal fan writing this review, so I know what the hell I'm talking about. I dont listen to pop punk like what's popular today, and (unlike that pillow biter whirligig) I dont listen to Dire Straits and then dump on Led Zeppelin in all my reviews. I listen to 100% balls to the wall HEAVY metal. I just needed to get that out of the way. Thank you, here's my review.  <br /> <br />The black album by Metallica was their major mainstream release, and is a good album. The songs are good and heavy and at the same time have good melody and are catchy.  That being said, this album pales in comparison to the previous 4 Metallica albums. Metallica before this album played blistering fast hardcore thrash metal. On the black album their \\"we don't give a s**t attitude is gone. They shortened their songs and dumbed down the playing, and this release comes across as soft and weak. They even included a ballad, unheard of in their past.  <br /> <br />The songs: <br />1) Enter Sandman: 9.5/10- The most popular Metallica song, and one of the highlights of the album. <br />2) Sad But True: 8.5/10- Slowed down a lot but nice n heavy. Dont like the chorus too much <br />3) Holier Than Thou: 10/10- Good and fast, like old Metallica. Really dig Hammett's solo, but the song could have been longer in my book. <br />4) The Unforgiven: 3/10- Where the album starts to get soft. Slow and heartfelt. Not Metallica. This song just sucks. <br />5) Wherever I May Roam: 8/10 whew! after the unforgiven a sigh of relief. A decent song that has many peaks and valleys with the heavy and fast factor. <br />6) Don't Tread on Me: 8/10- too slow and the solo wasn't that great <br />7) Through the Never: 9/10- good song, I like it <br />8) Nothing Else Matters: 2/10- awful. 'Nuff said. <br />9) Of Wolf and Man: 7/10- I like the song except for the lyrics. A song about being an animal? Kinda corny. <br />10) The God That Failed: 7/10- Too slow in my opinion <br />11) My Friend of Misery: 7/10- meh. That's all I can say about this track <br />12) The Struggle Within- 9/10- I like the dropoffs and pickups between the chorus and the verse riff. A good fast and heavy song, and a great solo from Kirk. <br /> <br />This was the first Metallica album I ever bought, and at the time I thought it was the best album I had ever heard. I then worked my way back through their catalog, getting ...And Justice for All, Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, and Kill 'Em All. I recommend the black album for those who are looking to get their first Metallica or even metal album. Don't get Load or anything past it, those albums are downright terrible. Other albums metal fans need to get include: <br />Rust in Peace- Megadeth <br />Peace Sells...But Nobody's Buying-Megadeth <br />Vulgar Display of Power-Pantera <br />Cowboys from Hell-Pantera <br />Appetite for Destruction- GNR <br />Mafia- B.L.S. <br />The Number of the Beast- Iron Maiden <br />Powerslave- Iron Maiden <br />Paranoid- Black Sabbath <br />anything by Motorhead

This movie can change ideas and sterotypes about people with Autism or anyother mental disease/problem whatever you may call it.<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman are great in this movie of two brothers who just met, one with a very short temper and one with a pretty unique view of life through a mental illness.
B00008OLYN|1.0|I am a huge Opeth fan but I was so disappointed when I got this CD. The first time I put it in my cd player I thought I had accidently gotten a defective one where they put some other bands cd in my case. I kept popping it in and out and trying to figure out why I was listening to what I would call \\"pop\\" music. I understand now that this was some wild attempt on Opeth's part to do something different but if I had wanted to listen to soft, spineless stuff I would have ordered The New Radicals or Lit. <br />Booooooooooooo on this one. I LOVE the rest of their stuff.

B00006RU5B|3.0|I liked Soundgarden just fine, but I didn't shed a tear when grunge music slid out of public consciousness.  Audioslave is a band made up of musicians who want to make music and tour.  I have no problem with that.  Hailing Audioslave as the greatest thing in rock music is either ignorance or extremely bad taste.  Rage Against The Machine was a historic event.  They, collectively and individually, were as talented and driven as any great band and their music will be remembered for decades.  When Zack left that group, the rest of the band searched for a replacement to carry on and developed chemistry with Chris Cornell.  They recorded and released an album and its okay (at best).  Chris Cornell can't vocally compete with the intensity or intelligence of Zack de la Rocha.  He eliminated the political voice since he is not into that and the music world suffers.  I heard a rumor that they recorded with DMX before settling for Chris Cornell and I think that may have been Rage Against The Machine's last hope.  If they enjoy making music, more power to them.  If you enjoy listening to it, more power to you.  If you were looking for politically charged insight, you'll have to wait for a Zack de la Rocha's solo album, the Rage-era is over.  Three stars for the backing band, a tight unit that will hopefully release some instrumentals soon.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Takes a turn back toward punk, away from the metal of Siren Song.  All 4 albums are very similar.  Sufferer is a little less aggressive and a little more melodic. <br /> <br />Not sure which disc is my favorite, usually it's whichever of the four I'm listening to at the time, although I probably prefer the raw emotion and speed of The Unraveling. <br /> <br />Was a little nervous when I hear d Rooftops on the radio- it sounded waaaay too commercial, like they'd gotten a taste of success and liked it too much.  But I was relieved when I heard the whole cd- it's still the same group.  Tim's voice is one of the best in music and the lyrics are what punk should be. <br /> <br />This isn't emo or pop punk garbage, it's the real thing and it's great to have another cd of it.  If you're into the harder stuff, also check out the new Ministry-Rio Grande Blood.  It's fast and furious and worthy of the band that gave us Psalm 69.

B00006CJOY|1.0|i've read all the previous posts, and i'm shocked that no one has said a thing about the editing and mixing.   <br /> <br />i mean, come on.  if you listen to this cd straight through, it doesn't make sense.  if someone cut two minute snippets of twenty-nine songs and stuck them all together with masking tape, it would sound like this.  songs don't start or end; jarring random cuts happen mid-song.   <br /> <br />someone keeps bumping the jukebox, but you don't hear the needle scratch.   <br /> <br />which might be cool if this wasn't a LIVE ALBUM.  being a live recording, these cuts affect the sound of the audience as well. large crowds of people do not sound like this. <br /> <br />listening to this cd in my car made me mad enough to get off my butt and figure out how to post a review.  and i like manu chao.  whoever assembled this live package shouldn't be allowed to work with recordings again.  this album is easily the most unlistenable thing i've heard in years.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Being a die-hard Madonna fan, I have previously always thought of P!nk as one of the up & coming female singers (the ooh baby ooh types) who show a lot of skin, but don't exhibit much else...How wrong could I be!  I bought this CD solely for her song \\"Dear Mr. President\\", and it is one of the best scathing criticisms of Mr. G.W. Bush that I have heard in recent years!  She does not hold back, particularly with her wanting to tell him about \\"hard work...minimum wage with a baby on the way...\\"  What about that, George?...as she says:  \\"You don't know nothing about hard work!\\"  It gives chills down my spine when I hear it..it is that dead-on and sincere!!! I admire her courage in having the nerve to distribute this song... Her other songs are great, such as the hit: \\"Stupid Girls\\", and \\"I got money now\\"...\\"Who Knew?\\"..GREAT VOICE ...along with her duet with her Dad...I have to say she has not replaced my Madonna, but still captures my interest in terms of who I will continue to follow, as she is someone who seriously wishes to   contribute to society as a MUSICIAN., not simply an entertainer.
0596009208|1.0|I'm an experienced programmer that had to learn Java in a hurry. I picked up this book thinking that it would give me a general introduction which I could then fill in as needed by reading parts of a reference book (Java in a Nutshell). After 40 pages, I realized that this was a BIG mistake. This book is way-too-beginner oriented. I found its presentation style petty and irritating. Fortunately a colleague told me about Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java. This is a much better book that treats its reader like an adult!
B000F39MAQ|4.0|This is the by now famous and not a little controversial 2005 Salzburg Festival production of La Traviata. It's a live performance recorded over five nights at the Grosses Festspielhaus with the best bits spliced together to form this video. It was to all intents and purposes a tremendous success. The audio CD has already become the fastest selling opera CD in Austrian history. It earned platinum status earlier this year, a near miraculous feat for a full-length opera recording in this day and age. <br /> <br />The performances are almost universally outstanding. The star of this opera is without doubt the lovely Russian soprano Anna Netrebko who sings the role of Violetta. One critic called it \\"the Netrebko show.\\" Besides a gorgeous voice, she is a stunning beauty and a joy just to look at. Rolando Villazon is also superb in his role as Alfredo. And Thomas Hampson makes a very distinguished Germont. There is little to fault here in terms of performance. <br /> <br />The production itself reflects a continuing tendency to reinterpret or reinvent opera. This is a post-modernist, ultra minimalist staging of Traviata. There is barely anything onstage except for 2 or 3 couches and a large clock. Most of the time you just see the bare white stage with the singers. The final scene takes place on a totally empty stage, with just the performers singing. I wonder if European audiences are really so sick of traditional operatic staging that they must resort to this stripdown version or is it more the case of pretentious avant-garde producers run amuck? I may be old fashioned but I still want to see some semblance of a set when I watch opera. <br /> <br />The fact that the performers are still able to hold the audience spellbound despite the utter paucity of the set and stage design, speaks volumes for the luminous quality of these perfomances. But I agree with the other reviewers here who wrote that this shouldn't be a first choice recommendation and should not be someone's first introduction to the opera. Someone new to the plot would be quite lost, as all the action takes place on the same 1 or 2 couches in front of the same large white clock. <br /> <br />The DVD is presented in the new widescreen format of 1.78:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picture quality is excellent with sharp images and warm, vibrant, accurate colors. Black levels are perfectly set. Audio is available in 2.0 PCM Stereo (CD quality) and DTS 5.1. Sound is gorgeously rich and sumptuous. The original Italian libretto is included as optional subtitles, along with 5 other languages including English. The onscreen menu only allows direct access to the 3 Acts, although there are a total of 39 individual cues which you can navigate with your remote. The second disc contains about an hour's worth of extras, mainly a 43min documentary on the rehearsals with interviews of the participants, an introduction to the opera by Villazon and a trailer for Anna's other DVD - \\"The Woman, The Voice.\\" There is a 30 page souvenir booklet with color photographs of the production as well as production notes and a detailed synopsis. My only criticism here is the packaging. For an expensive \\"Premium Edition\\" DVD, the carboard foldout format, without even a slipcase to hold it in, is disgraceful. I can't even put it on the shelf without it falling open and tipping over. Still it is good to finally have a memento of this lovely performance. Opera lovers who cannot bear the staging (or lack of it) may want to buy the audio CD instead.
B000F6IOBQ|4.0|It is interesting to watch and see the path the film's creative team takes in a sequel.  In some cases, in a series like Alien, James Cameron decided to move in a more action-oriented direction with the sequel to Alien.  The 3rd film in that series failed because they stripped out the strong characters developed (Hicks and Newt) and went with mostly undeveloped characters whom you didnt really care for. <br /> <br />With Underworld: Evolution, Len Wiseman also focused more on action and less on the characters introduced in the first film, but rather than turning Evolution into purely a mindless \\"chase\\" or action film, he strengthened the 2 leads by providing depth to them and expaning their relationship. <br /> <br />I felt the second film had less of a focused plot, and this undercut the driving nature that was found in the first film.  The initial film also enjoyed a general cohesiveness that the second one lacked due to its looser and more difficult to follow plot.  <br /> <br />The second also had some plot holes, such as the existence of Alexander Corvinos that noone in the first film knew of, despite he being the father of all vampires and lycans. <br /> <br />But overall, it was a very strong sequel and definitely worth your time.   Kate Beck is the dream...

On his way to his former home he finds a turtle that he keeps as a pet present for his little brother Noah. The turtle may stand as a metaphor for the slow but secure progress of the narrative. Tome also meets a \\"reformed\\" preacher who likes to question the goodness of baptism, and a former neighbour, Muley Graves, who has decided to stay in the land in Oklahoma contrary to the general westward pull: \\"Place where folks live is them folks.\\"<br /><br />As he meets them, the Joads are getting ready to sell all their belongings and move to California. But how will their sense of identity be affected by the migration? The author seems worried about the conflict between the land and the machine. Something worse than the devil seems to have got hold of hte country and thousands of people are moving West, looking for something brighter than what they have got. Is it possible to relinquish your home and survive it whole? On their way to California they learn the value of sharing and helping one another after they meet the Wilsons. One thing is sure, and these mass migrations are the proof that men can still be moved by a concept, a palpitating notion, a dream (even if such dream is reduced to the image of a white house by an orange groove).<br /><br />One is to fear the day when man will refuse to move about, search, project. Even if this search is to lead to tragedy and loss. The will to live and to die and to survive for a concept makes of man a distinctive being in the universe: \\"Need is the stimulus to concept, concept to action.\\" But can Paine and Jefferson exist alongside Marx and Lenin?

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Yes, it's been established that Wolfmother sounds very reminiscent of classic rock greats including Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. But to dislike the music for that reason alone is preposterous. Wolfmother takes the sound of these great bands and works with it and twists it, creating track after track of solid rock, each unique and set apart from the previous one. If the only music we listened to was music that is uninfluenced and unaffected by the music before it, then as listeners we wouldn't have a whole lot to work it. When held up in comparison to most mainstream music of today which consists mostly of over-produced, marketed product, \\"Wolfmother\\" is a breath of extremely fresh air. This album has no filler and is packed with rock, rock, and more rock . . . something I have no problem with, regardless of its influences.
B000063UR2|5.0|Definitely one of the greatest fantasy movies of all time. It is a classic tale of good versus evil filled with goblins, fairies, elves, unicorns and mortals. A young Tom Cruise plays Jack, a forest-dwelling hero in love with the lovely princess Lily (Mia Sara). In an attempt to win his true love's heart, he introduces Lily to the unicorns warning her that she must not touch them, which of course she does (breaking off the unicorn's horn and plunging the world into utterly cold despair). She is then kidnapped by an evil goblin who takes her to his master (the devil himself), As in all good fairytales the hero must rescue the beautiful damsel in distress, in this case to save the world from eternal darkness.  <br />It is Tim Curry's portrayal of the Lord of Darkness that stands out as exceptionally fine. With incredible costumes and makeup and delightful set designs this movie is delightful for all but the very young (some scenes may be too scary). <br />Be sure to watch the bonus disc which features lost scenes, a photo gallery, a music video by Brian Ferry \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\\", and commentary by director Ridley Scott. Be sure to listen to the fabulous soundtrack of this delightful movie.
0316172324|5.0|I've read the book a few times.  The first couple of times I agreed with the criticism that it is a bunch of interesting anecdotes that don't actually come together into a theory.  But now I think that all the examples do contribute to one idea and the problem is that Gladwell doesn't explain clearly exactly what he is doing.  The confusing thing is that he is not just showing us examples of people caught in the act of rapid cognition.  He is also showing us examples of things in nature and society that have data that could be processed in a rapid way.  He is describing examples of the known along with examples of the knower.      For instance, he shows that of all the data we could gather to determine the health of a marriage all we really need to pay attention to is whether or not the couple show contempt for each other.  And that there are only a few things you ought to know to best decide whether chest pain is a heart attack.  In the case of heart attack detection, he doesn't show anyone actually thin slicing.  Instead he shows how a hospital set up a kind of artificial thin slicing by forcing its doctors to ask a specific set of only 4 or 5 questions instead of the tens or hundreds they possibly could attend to.    The book goes on to describe ways in which people study a set of data for a long enough time that the detection of it has become part of their unconscious.  It also describes methods people use to either avoid bad thin slicing or create the proper context for their thin slicing to work.  For instance, he describes police departments that set up procedures to avoid getting into situations where they would have to depend on a rapid cogition that in times of crushing stress can move so fast it shuts out vital information.  A good section of this book revolves around the idea that what an expert is is someone who has in one way or another developed his or her ability to thin slice and who also manages this ability by controlling the environment in whichthin slicing is going to occur.  Gladwell has not declared war on abstract thinking.  He just thinks that one of its uses should be to open up more circumstances where rapid cognition can be used effectively and to avoid situations swhere its use is ineffective.  It is hard not to agree with this once  you consider how many times each of us has made a split-second mistake that botched a moment with a loved one or let the opportunity to do the right thing pass us by.    I think the book is coherent, it just explores different facets and implications of rapid cognition without doing an adequate job of explaining its movement from one facet to another.

I couldn't believe my ears, it was wonderful!  The District Sleeps Alone Tonight had me pining for lost love along with Gibbard, meanwhile Such Great Height's soft cool electronic melodies soothed my aching heart.  Brand New Colony was a mixture of old and new, I recognized the Mario Theme as well as the Depeche Mode influences in the song.  I LOVE THIS ALBUM, I can't seem to listen to it enough.  We Will Become Silhouettes had me tapping my foot and singing along throughout the entire length.  When I reached Dallas, (before checking into my hotel) I went to Barnes and Noble and tried to find any other albums by the Postal Service, but alas they only have released three singles since Give Up.  I would recommend all of them.  The Shins's version of \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\" is great.  I love this album.  If you don't own it, do.
B000055Y0X|5.0|The 1964 black comedic masterpiece from director Stanley Kubrick centers around the dropping of \\"THE BOMB\\". A surprise nuclear airstrike on the USSR is ordered by a crazy General (Sterling Hayden), leading Captain Mandrake to frantically attempt to locate the recall code to stop the bombing. <br />With an all-star cast of outstanding performances, Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, James Earl Jones, Sterling Hayden & Keenan Wynn, you can't go wrong. Peter Sellers shines in three different roles- Captain Mandrake (General's Aide), the President of the U.S. and the President's advisor (ex-Nazi scientist) Dr. Strangelove. <br />Nominated for 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Peter Sellers) & Best Screenplay Adaptation this is one of the top 10 greatest cult classics of all time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I can understand why this album is difficult for some to love or often like, but it just fit for me. If anything its worth a try for anybody who loves music, and you might just fall in love like i did. Or you wont. This disk is sprawling, layered, and diverse if anything, and it resonated with me. I found it deeply absorbing. Highs...Exit Music (for a film), Let Down, Karma Police, most of the album, for me, actually... though I admit i found Electioneering a bit too roudy.
B000FILW86|4.0|Like a fine wine, Cheap Trick just continues to get better with age. After losing their way in the late 80's and early 90's, the band ditched the big record label interference and returned to form with 1997's self-titled album. That winning streak continued with 2003's \\"Special One,\\" and, I'm happy to report, \\"Rockford,\\" their latest effort, which is named after their hometown of Rockford, Ill. It's not hyperbole to say those three releases stack up with anything the band has ever produced, including \\"Budokan,\\" \\"Dream Police,\\" \\"Heaven Tonight,\\" \\"All Shook Up\\" and the first \\"Cheap Trick.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Rockford\\" is power pop at its finest, the Beatles on steroids. Vocalist Robin Zander, who reportedly labored particularly hard over this album, contiunes in his \\"Man of 1,000 voices\\" persona. Tom's bottom-heavy 12-string bass and Bun E's perfect timing push the tracks along. And Rick? Well, Rick is just Rick. Check out his guitar solo on \\"All Those Years\\" if you have any doubts. <br /> <br />The weakest tracks are \\"Welcome to the World\\" (a rewrite of \\"Hello There\\") and \\"Come on Come on Come on\\" (tries too hard to sound punk-like). But the rest are winners. Particular standouts include \\"Perfect Stranger\\" (the first single and a kiss off to all those record label execs, producers, managers and hangers on who always gave them bad advice about how to sound, how to dress and to change their logo and name). Others are \\"Decaf\\" (Robin wired on hi-fi), \\"This Time You Got it\\" (the chorus is a killer) and the aforementioned \\"All those Years\\" (a ballad with punch). <br /> <br />As mentioned earlier, the band started producing its finest work after leaving a big label back in the mid 1990s. The only problem with this decision is that they now lack the necessary promotional money for videos, radio airplay and tour dates. That means \\"Rockford,\\" like \\"Special One\\" and \\"Cheap Trick\\" is destined to fall on deaf ears with the general public. And that's a shame because these are terifficalbums. They'll pick you up after a long day at work and put a smile on your face. Trust me, they've been doing that for me since I bought \\"Budokan\\" in 1978 and fell in love with \\"four great guys and three great chords.\\" <br /> <br />My only other regret? That my best friend Dennis isn't around to enjoy \\"Rockford\\" with me. He passed away in 2004. We have been listening to Cheap Trick records and going to their concerts together since we used to tool around in his old pick up listening to a beat-up cassette of \\"All Shook Up.\\" But I have to believe he's up there looking down and has already added \\"Rockford\\" tracks to his ultimate Trick mix tape. <br /> <br />If you're a Cheap Trick fan, you probably already have this. (And congrats on your good taste). If you've never given the band a try or thought they disappeared from the face of the earth years ago, do yourself a favor and pick this up. \\"Rockford\\" proves you can go home again.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I couldn't agree more in the sense that this is one of the finest soundtracks of 2005. The songs are beautiful with no exceptions, and the music is quite haunting. This is one of those soundtracks that offers the necessary atmosphere to the main issues of the movie: sort of sad, nostalgic and romantic. It certainly is a magnificent album that will be enjoyed even by those sensibilities who felt somehow touched by the delicate subject of the movie.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|A few years ago my friend had me listen to songs from a new cd by a band she'd been listening to. I was blown away. It was hardcore, raw, and the poltical songs actually had meaning. That band was Rise Against and the cd none other than their classic Revolutions Per Minute.  <br /> <br />Ever since, I've been hooked.  <br /> <br />I purchased The Sufferer and The Witness the day after it came out and I wasn't disappointed. This is album though, is Rise Against's most polished by far. Tim's voice isn't as gritty in some songs but you still can tell that you're listening to Rise Against.  <br /> <br />TS&TW is a great album for both new fans and RA die hards and it doesn't disappoint. Neither do their live shows, I highly recommend seeing thme live if you ever get the opportunity. They're most definately worth it. <br /> <br /> <br />My standout songs are: <br /> <br />Prayer Of The Refugee (In my opinion, the best song on the whol album) <br /> <br />The Approaching Curve (Definately something new for RA but it works really well. Tim proves he is and has always been a great writer as the lyris come from a short story written by him years ago) <br /> <br />Bricks (Classic Rise Against, short fast and loud)
0446691437|3.0|Not a bad book.  Has some good ideas but it is not one that I will pick up and read over for insight or inspiration.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|I'm the first to admit I'm an impatient film viewer. I give a movie 20 minutes to get me involved in either the plot or the characters. I need to make an emotional connection to someone. Don't take this to mean I need immediate action ... many of my favorites are foreign films that introduce intriguing characters and then slowly tell their story. But I need to KNOW what the heck is going on and who the people are.<br /><br />After 37 minutes of this movie, I still didn't understand anything. The editing was so choppy that the story jumped from one unrelated scene to another in what was far too rapid fire for this ol' brain to absorb. I still only had a vague notion of who the main characters were, and cared less.<br /><br />I rented this film because I believe wholeheartedly in its message, but I just can't give a 'thumbs up' to the way that message was delivered.<br /><br />I'm sure if you are more patient and can deal with such disjointed story-telling, this might be a great film for you. But if you enjoy your films to be more linear, you might want to pass on this on.<br /><br />One other point: A film like this takes hundreds (thousands?) of people and tons of equipment -- all transported to various locales via ... you guessed it ... gas guzzling vehicles. Somehow it seems ironic to me that good intentioned people add to the problem while purporting to publicize it.
B000EPR7NE|3.0|Despite some terrible reviews the movie received, I found it entertaining and quite faithful to the book. The soundtrack is not bad, but I expected more from Hans Zimmer. It sounds conventional and somehow uninspired. I admit that it helps the movie a lot since most of the themes are quite atmospheric, yet I feel that the movie theme gave opportunities for more creativity. Hans Zimmer is far from his best creations such as \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\", \\"Thelma & Louise\\", \\"The Lion King\\", \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Black Hawk Down\\". Anyhow, it is an interesting work if you don't compare it to some of the composer's previous creations.
B00007GZR5|4.0|I'd give this film 5 stars on most levels, <br />the only thing that made me rate it a \\"4\\" <br />would be the reviews that say it is based <br />on a novel, and that it did not portray <br />the novel accurately. <br /> <br />Honestly, I didn't read the novel, so <br />I was not able to tell the difference. <br /> <br />If this was based on the novel- meaning- <br />it was loosely conceived from the novel, <br />then I believe it deserves the full 5, <br />since there is nothing insulting to the <br />viewer if the movie does not boast itself <br />as the novel on film. <br /> <br />But if it was adapted from the novel and <br />missed key elements then I would have to <br />say 4 stars.
0380788624|5.0|An outstanding and exciting novel.  At first, the prose struck me as somewhat wordy but one quickly becomes accustomed to this and, in fact, appreciative of it.  It would appear the author is attempting to affect the writting style of the old time classical novelists (Dickens or Melville come to mind) and this is OK although the professor of English would perhaps chide such an approach as being overambitious.  Irrespective of this, the plot of the story, jumping back and forth between accurately described chaos in Asia in World War 2 and exciting modern day business intrigue in the Phillipines and the well developed two main characters, one a classic young businessman and the other a quintessential computer hacker, hold the readers interest in a fully satisfying manner.  The occasional digressions, such as the hilarious depiction of the hacker's ex girlfriend and her oh so perfect politically correct ivy league friends, are to be savoured and enjoyed.  The excitement builds throughout the book and for me, this is one of those rare novels which can be read several times with new ideas and details arising at each read.  An outstanding effort.
B000058983|2.0|I have been moved to write another review after my last one received such an overwhelming response (all unhelpful votes, thanks)!    Respect to Arthur Lee and bereft fans now that he is gone, and leukaemia is a terrible illness that I wouldn't wish upon anyone.    OK, that said, I have not changed my position on the lack of musical quality of this album! Please, if you are here wondering about buying this, ignore the hype and instead listen to a great psychedelic album like Tim Buckley's Lorca or Starsailor.    There are so many reviews saying how timeless this \\"masterpiece\\" is. I ask that anyone who actually thinks this album is good and is not affected by the sentimentality of being alive in the 60s please email me and tell me what is so good about it, as I am afraid that I've missed it. I can be contacted at \\"lucas underscore sewell at fastmail dot fm\\".    Thanks!    Lucas.    The following is the original review:  Excuse me?    I kept reading about this amazing album, Forever Changes: one of the greatest albums ever.    I saw it in my local shop for $5 so I figured I had nothing to lose. I can't listen to this album! It makes me feel like I am going to be sick. I know that sounds extreme, but it is honest! The lyrics, singing and instrumentation, and especially the precussion all make me cringe (did I miss anything? That pretty much makes up all of the music, if you take away the obvious nostagia that some people seem to have for this).    I dearly love so much music from the late 60s and early 70s, with Tim Buckley and Nick Drake being my all time favourites. Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon (and Garfunkel), Beatles, John Martyn, Bert Jansch, and more recent musicians like Elliott Smith, Sufjan Stevens, Will Oldham, Devendra Banhart, Stina Nordenstam & Bjork are all well loved by me.    If you are coming from really good music like the above and you are considering this one, my suggesting is not to bother.     Or, you could be like me and buy it find outwhy it is not worth buying. It will be one of those that you never listen to, and if you respect your collection you may end up putting this one on eBay.     I hope I have helped someone through this review, but for me it is just nice to vent this cringe reflex out onto this page.    Thanks for reading!    Lucas.
B0002858YS|1.0|If I have to listen to another song by the Killers, I'm going to put my nuts in a blender!
B000EGCITG|5.0|This album is easily the best album I have bought this year! It's absolutely amazing from beginning to end! It's extrmely dissapointing that the album has not been as well receieved here in the US as it has been overseas. But anyway, here is the rundown of my fav songs in the order they appear on the album:    1. Stupid Girls-its the 1st single. everyone knows this song. very funny song, but also very good. has a good message if you look beyond the shallowness of it. :) 3.5/5    2. Who Knew-2nd single from the album. one of my top 3 favs. amazing song. i can relate very much. fav part of the song is the bridge right before the final course when she says \\"THAT LAST KISS I'LL CHERISH UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN. TIME MAKES IT HARDER...YOU VISIT ME IN MY SLEEP...\\" ugh! i just love it! 5/5    3. Long Way To Happy-another brilliant track. Great rock ballad. Amazing lyrics again. I don't understand how one can write such great lyrics! 4/5    4. Dear Mr. President-this is another of my top 3 favs. the words are just amazing and powerful. to see her perform this song live is s0o0o emotional. her vocals are amazing! 5/5    5.

Other amazing unreleased/bsides to download are \\"Centerfold\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" which are probably my two fav songs from this album's era!
B00004Y6NX|1.0|I really hate Dire straits.I am amazed as to how can anyone like their albums and give them five stars.I have always felt that Mark Knopfler was an over rated guitarist who could not hold a candle to guitar greats like Eric Clapton,Jimmy Page,Pete Townshend and David Gilmour.So please do yourself a favour and avoid this boring album.Get any AC/DC cd instead.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Butch and Sundance is an amazing wonderful film: in this ultimate collectors edition it sparkles like a beautiful jewel. The package is complete (I always thought the 1997 version was missing William Goldman's commentary - this one has it!): if you were a fan of this terrific western when it first appeared in the first flush of 1969-70 you will not be disappointed to revisit with Butch and Sundance and their hole in the wall gang. Its also a great chance to listen in again as 3 beautiful stars and countless other key personnel recount what it was like to put this wonderful film together.<br />God bless Geo. Roy Hill et al for making this western and changing many of our lives in the process. For this formerly 11 year old boy, I left the theater determined to be a film director. I studied writing by reading and re-reading Goldman's original screenplay over 40 times. When I finally got a chance to shoot film, of course I experimented with sepia tones!<br />  This is not the most coherent review I've ever slapped together but it makes up for coherence by being heartfelt. If you haven't seen Butch (and I know a lot of film scholars who haven't) you really don't know film.<br />  This is a classic film from several key players who have made their share of immortal classics. And the best part is, its not a bitter pill to swallow. This one tastes good going down!<br /><br />note: this review is for the 2 disc version, although the special edition released a few years back is also a wonderful buy. no matter how much Butch you want in your life, they are both worthy editions. In general, anything by Redford or Newman is well worth watching (when its penned by Bill Goldman, you're in for a special treat!) .
B000068CNX|4.0|Season two of Friends picks up some from season one, although in my opinion it is just before the real glory days of the series.  During season two, several important events take place, including the beginning of Ross and Rachel's relationship, which will be such a cornerstone of the show's entire run, several episodes centering around Ross' newborn son Ben, and Chandler's crazy new roommate, Eddie.  Particularly good episodes in this season are: \\"The One Where Ross Finds Out,\\" \\"The One With the List,\\" and \\"The One Where Eddie Won't Go.\\"  Memorable guest appearances are made by: Catherine Bell, Dan Castellaneta, June Gable, Adam Goldberg, Elliott Gould, Chrissie Hynde, Chris Isaak, Phil Leeds, Ron Leibman, Emily Procter, Giovanni Ribisi, Julia Roberts, Tom Selleck, Charlie Sheen, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Mitchell Whitfield, and Fred Willard. <br /> <br />Quotes from this season: <br />- Ross : Do you think he'll be surprised to see me?  <br />Chandler : Yes, at first. Then he'll realize he's a monkey, and isn't capable of that emotion.\\" <br />- Chandler : \\"If I end up like my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blonde chasing after 20 year old boys, or I'll end up like my mom.\\"
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Britney Spears conjurs up many, many different reactions from different people.  The infamous pop superstar, known for super-smashes like \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" and the Grammy-garnering \\"Toxic,\\" may be out with the tide in a sea of musical obscurity right now, but in the late 90s and early 2000s there is no doubt Spears brought a lot to the table.  She does not possess a technically-skilled instrument, but it's instantly recognizable, a trait that's not common in today's masses of singers.  Her Greatest Hits covers her biggest singles, as well as some previously unreleased ones that no doubt would have shot to No. 1 on the charts had they been released commercially, and is Britney's best record because, like most Best Of albums, it covers her career-spanning and most recognizable tracks rather than the tepid filler found in most studio releases.  If you're looking for one CD instead of a whole Spears collection, this is the one to buy.  Be a fan or degrader of the sensation, there's no denying Britney Spears' hold in the entertainment industry.
B000000W5P|4.0|I love the stones.they are amongst my favorite bands.I love almost all their other albums and they really make some terrific music.I would request you to get all their albums including this one.Recommended.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This movie made my jaw drop. The thought process to make this movie is not from this planet. I give ten thumbs up to the writer of this work of art. US movie makers are behind the times compared to this movie.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|yo, how could dey sell out to a puss like 50, this is pure crap, who kid, 50, g unit, there all just pothetic, right as i write this review im wearin a GUNOT t, Mobb deep needs to do themselves a favor and go get signed to Game, this album just shows wat 50 will do to a pure great like mobb deep, im was listen to Cradle to the grave, and eye for an eye, for all those who don't remember, that was on there INFAMOUS, Infamous album, do yourself a favor and pick that one up
B00005JP4U|5.0|Al Gore's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is inconvenient in that he takes multiple opportunities to jab at President Bush.  To be fair, Bush is a reflection of the beliefs of many Americans, and members of Congress also have a role to play here, both historically and now.  This is true for both Democrats and Republicans.<br /><br />With that said, SHAME ON OUR LEADERS  for demonstrating such a lack of leadership here.  HATS OFF to Al Gore for sticking to his guns and driving his message home.<br /><br />It is extraordinary to read the reviews of climate scientists after they watch this film.  The bottom line?  Al Gore got the message right.  Do not let ANY politician get elected or stay in office if they won't deal with global climate change head on.  Refute EVERY naysayer who has an alternative explanation for rising CO2 and temperature levels.  MAKE THIS AN ISSUE YOU WANT ADDRESSED NOW!<br /><br />Our children deserve nothing less.
B0002W18MU|5.0|It's a bit hard to talk about this album.  If you want to hear a tired old man singing, then, by all means, buy this album and you may only listen to it once.   <br /> <br />If you want to hear from a man who was in love and had a truly broken heart, then listen to Johnny sing to June. I'd dare say that you'd not get past \\"On The Evening Train\\" without being moved.   <br /> <br />The heart of the man was broken in more than one way.  Listen to him sing to and about the Lord. While you're listening, remember Johnny's life and all that went with it. Then, project the thoughts of some of these songs onto yourself and be glad that you have the foresight of his life.  Some of the lines in these songs speak in a powerful way that they would not speak, if anyone other than Mr. Cash sang them. I looked at myself, when the clapping and stomping finally ended in \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down.\\" I could see myself, to some degree, in many of the characters that he sang about in that song. It was not a pretty sight. But, I take this as help from both the man and the Spirit that led him. <br /> <br />I've been trying for a very long time now to try to seperate body, soul and spirit into definable parts.  This album helped me to do this in a way that I've never been able to do before.  Mr. Cash was old and tired. His body was feeble.  If you've read anything at all about the album and how it came to be, and then listen to it, you'll have no doubt that he was tired. I believe that his soul had been ravaged (by his own actions) and then redeemed again (through June's love) and finally broken by June's death.  You cannot escape these thoughts on this album. The Spirit that I hope led him through these songs, especially the spirituals, is the motivating entity that sparked both his soul and his body to go through the rigors (not only physical) to accomplish the songs on this album.  He must have been so very tired at the end of some of these. <br /> <br />I've read a lot about his breathand the strength of his voice being noticable in varying degrees in these songs.  It is true.  And it adds all that much more character to the album. I was under no illusions when I bought this CD.  I was not expecting anything in regards to great and wonderful vocals.  What I was after, though, was the heart of the man.  I think that this CD delivers Mr. Cash's final days and feelings right into our own bosoms. Do not listen to this album when you are easily distracted. Don't. Listen to it when you have the time to dwell on his words. Listen to it when you have time to dwell on his voice. Listen to it when you have the time to listen to what might be spoken to your own soul at the time.  <br /> <br />Most albums I've ever bought, I've bought simply to listen to and to try to enjoy on an elementary level and perhaps escape the things of life, for a bit. Don't get this album if you are wanting an escape from life. It will hit you square in the face, from a man who has lived his life and run his race. <br /> <br />As you listen to the last track on this album You can almost hear Mr. Cash saying that all is done. When you hear the last note being played, reflect for just a moment on what you've just heard.  If you're like me, you'll have sit and listened to the whole album straight through and at the end, you'll be sad, but still have a smile on your face. <br /> <br />Yes Mr. Cash, you are free from the chain gang now.  Give June a kiss for all of us.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I hate Slipknot. In fact I hate all these new bands like SLipknot and all these new emo bands. Don't think I haven't given them a chance either, my friend made me listen to them and I couldn't stand a second of it. Slipknot are no Bon Jovi. <br /> <br />BTW don't listen completley to the Elmerson Lake & Palmer guys. They aren't the best either...Bon Jovi is.
B000002LEU|5.0|This is it. You've found it. Look no further. Because, my friends, music does not get any better than this. Every song, every lyric reaches down and soothes my darkest depths. I find myself at a loss of words because nothing can describe something so beautiful but the music itself. Give this cd patience. It's challenging but it grows, and it grows, and it grows. New Order does not even compare to the genious of Ian Curtis. Whatever possessed him to trancend all that seems humanly possible?
B000002L99|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I like Van Hagar (not as much as Roth though). This album just bores me to death. \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" and \\"Dreams\\" are the only two songs that don't. \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"5150\\" are decent songs as well, but I think \\"Summer Nights\\" and especially \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" are boring as hell. Those two songs make me miss Diamond Dave. I'd highly reccommend any Roth VH CD (along with Eat Em and Smile) or any other Van Hagar CD over this one.
B000089Q9D|5.0|I watched this movie several times. <br />Great director, great story, great representation of that time in Italia. This movie creates a feeling of nostalgia, reciprocity between people and community. It also has a very innocent love story and an great ending. A real contrast to newage Hollywood blockbusters!
B000AWYOGE|1.0|This movie was terrible.  It made no sense, had little direction and focus, and was just plain BAD.  The plot was pretty much non-existant.
006441034X|5.0|My brother introduced me to the Howl's Moving Castle movie by Miyazaki a few months ago. I loved the movie so much i watched it atleast 2 or 3 times in the same week and still watch it about once a week now. All my fascination with it led me to purchase the book a few weeks later. I'm not a big reader at all but Diana Wynne Jones knows how to keep it interesting. The book has so much more to the story then  the movie portrayed. It had more twists and surprises that kept you wanting to continue reading. I finished the book in 3 days... which for me... is a huge success story. I enjoy the characters so much and relate so much to Sohpie's personality. I definantly would suggest anyone and everyone to read this tale.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a timeless love story and this adaptation has definitely captured the spirit of the book. This was a purchase I certainly didn't regret.
1401302378|5.0|I've been working in the Long Tail for about a year....talking to people, most of which have never heard of it, or those that have and treat it like \\"buzz\\"...the \\"next thing\\" on the internet, soon to fade.  I meet few who get it....really get it.  The book will help you get it, but if you read half of it, or only remember and regurgitate quotes, it's still worth it, buy it and enjoy it for that, but you'd be missing the point. <br /> <br />If you are a creative entrepreneur, use it as a launching pad for ideas.  The Long Tail is a lot of things, but for me, it is a way to create an endless variety of products on top of products that satisfy human needs.  Besides Chris' examples..there are many more.  Try this one...it's a cola that has flavor tops so you can mix your own.  Think \\"jelly belly\\" for soda, except you make up the flavor, and the strength.  It's Long Tail...but only long enough based on the flavor inputs, decided by somebody else...the real Long Tail would be to enable users to input their own flavors from ANY where....sounds gross?...but that's the point, somebody would want to mix garlic powder spice and the old tang in their pantry...doesn't have to be a lot of people, just not zero. <br /> <br />Search Google without the quotes <br />\\"damn interesting choosing your own cola for more\\" <br /> <br />So...don't just read into the surface hype..it's not hype if you think!  Want another example?  Guy Kawasaki did it with his \\"book cover\\" for The Art of the Start...hmmm...taking customer input...wow...then letting them decide...amazing, Long Tail of book covers.  A very cool business fact is this....you can have Long Tail products and not have to produce them until the order is placed....like a bracelet company that has beads with every language and every character, including wingdings for those daring enough, then you only make what people buy...inventory for beads is pretty small too. <br /> <br />Garlic Tang Cola and Wingding beads...maybe, but the good ideas are reserved for the VC's that get it...some do, some don't. <br /> <br />Look around....be creative...it's there...\\"The invisible market has turned visible\\" pg. 6...for some anyway.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|The name of this album pretty much states the overall status of this widely-acclaimed collection. This is truly one of the best albums in all of musical history with it's unique sense of style, sweet melodies, unforgetable lyrics, and upbeat rhythms. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" truly signifies music of the already progressing millennium. Mariah has lived up to \\"artist of the decade\\" in the 90s and clearly displays now. <br /> <br />This is honestly her greatest yet. It is a must-have and deserves re-released as a diamond album like \\"Music Box\\" and \\"Daydream.\\"
B0009R1T7M|5.0|WTF. It's pronounced IlliNOY. Not IlliNOISE. I'd give this album -5 stars if I could. I bet if I tried to give it 1 star, Amazon wouldn't post it, because they want to inflate their big pockets with money from consumers who read their favorable reviews and then get in line to add more money to the pockets of the Amazon superheavy moneybags guys. <br /> <br />This album is awesome. I really like the guitars. I think every record album should have more guitars. And not those little Hawaiian guitars, but those big pointy ones like in hair metal videos. Double the fun if there are two guitars in one. Sextuple the fun if the guitars are neon green. Sufjan Stevens reminds me of my friend, Patrick. He goes to Illinois for college. I don't know how many instruments he can play.

0790742780|4.0|One of the things I enjoy about Michael Douglas is his versatility at playing the white-male-power archetype. From Wall Street to The Game to War of the Roses (with the exception of Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile), he plays roles that critique and perpetuate ideas about white masculine power and the consequences of emasculation.<br /><br />In Falling Down, we see Douglas (in my opinion) in one of his better moments playing a working class, seething, neurasthenic average Joe named William Foster who goes on a downward spiral into moral vigilantism in La La Land (LA). Disgusted with what he sees as the flaws of society, Foster (Douglas) goes on a one man battle through the streets of LA to visit his estranged wife and daughter. Traffic jams, heat, high-priced goods in a Korean convenient store, gang violence, and road construction are among some of the many things that Foster responds to as he journeys back to the peaceful life he once had with his ex-wife (Barbara Hershey).  The only thing is that Foster never had a peaceful life with Beth (Hershey). He believes in an ideal that is virtually unattainable for him.<br /><br />Robert Duvall (Det. Martin Prendergast) plays opposite Douglas as a retiring robbery detective who is given one last moment to protect and serve before migrating to Arizona with his needy and emotionally fragile wife (Tuesday Weld). Essentially, Prendergast is Foster's nemesis and the only one who consequently understands his rage.<br /><br />Overall, I think this film is an interesting commentary on masculinity, xenophobia, race, and \\"urban life\\" during the Bush I administration in the early 1990s.
B0002WS3RS|4.0|A TON of fun - superbly executed and clearly remastered sounds!! <br /> <br />This is like early Pink Floyd - if Sid had remained in the group! <br />This is like King Crimson WITHOUT the technical chip on Fripp's shoulder - (...must...play....faster....) <br />This is like Zappa on mescalin! <br /> <br />This is post-Floyd psychedelia of a 'very high' calibre ;-)
B00005JOQS|5.0|Ever since Bryan singer left the highly anticipated X-men saga, people have wondered why he would leave such a successful series. But Bryan Singer heavily declared that reintroducing The Superman story has always been one of his lifelong dreams. (Just like Peter Jackson did with King Kong.)<br /><br />And his dedication in this film truly shows. Right from the getgo we are introduced to superman's nemesis Lex Luthor who is slowly plotting a plot to destroy superman and have his taste of victory once and for all. Follwoing that, Superman makes his entrance. But It's not your normal entrance. This Superhero's been gone for several years. And leaving Metropolis has taken it's toll on the citizen's. They now have learned to completely forget about superman and move on with there lives.<br /><br />(Just like in real life, audiences were secretly craving another superman movie but slowly moved on and thought that it wouldn't happen.)<br /><br />This time around, Lois lane has adapted her life completely Superman-free. That is, until, you know who starts flying around the town doing good deeds. You begin to realize that Superman is slowly rebuilding his status in Society and returning to what he does best.<br /><br />Replacing Gene hackman is Kevin Spacey, a perfect casting decision of course.<br /><br />Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a newcomer to the series and this is his debut film.<br /><br />Throughout the filme, you will notice that the special effects have been improved on massively compared to the 1978 version of the classic Superman. But Brandon routh doesn't feel like a simple replacment in my eyes. He looks and sounds just like christopher reeve which only brings more of a joy to the superman legacy of fans. Well done in casting, Bryan Singer.<br /><br />In this movie you'll find Drama, comedy, romance, thrills, chills, and shocks beyond compare.<br /><br />What I really, really, loved about this movie is it's close relationship to the fans and it's Christianized aspect.<br /><br />Not only is superman back and better than ever but the fans are overjoyed by the positive response. The movie even leaves room for a possible sequel. Oh, just a quick note, in order to fully comprehend when and where in the series this movie takes place, you must put Superman II completely out of your head.<br /><br />And, for a movie that lasts 2 1/2 hours, you'd think that it would drag but the good news is that it doesn't. Go See this movie and tell all of your friends!!<br /><br />Superman has just been reborn on screen!!o the fans and it's Christianized aspect. <br /> <br />Not only is superman back and better than ever but the fans are overjoyed by the positive response. The movie even leaves room for a possible sequel.

B0000A02TZ|4.0|'Animal House' released in '78 is an irreverent, depraved and sporadically humorous comedy about the fraternity life of a group of college underachievers and degenerates in search of easy women and their next beer. It's the movie that launched myriads of Toga Parties far and wide across the American landscape back in the late '70's and early '80's.<br /><br />Lots of funny stuff in this film, some not so funny stuff as well. The best moments clearly belong to the late John Belushi in his signature role as John 'Bluto' Blutarsky. Without his performance I don't think 'Animal House' would have received the love and acclaim it has through the years.<br /><br />National Lampoon took a big risk in producing this taboo breaking movie and it was the success of 'Animal House' that opened the doors to the flood of teen coming of age films to follow.
0743435729|5.0|Another exception book by David Weber in the Honor Harrington series. I love the female heroine, which is not common in the sci-fi genre of this type, and she is totally believable, totally relatable, and simply amazing! I have read each and every book of this series and except for one, I found them all to be equally compelling. Now, I want one of those cats! (read the book to find out what I mean!)
0553296981|4.0|A beutiful diary of the last days in Anne Frank's life. She was very grown for her young age. Anne Frank was jew so she came with 13 in a concentration camp.

B000067CPX|5.0|I absolutely love the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and this by far is their best album.  <br /> <br />If you don't want to buy the entire album (which you should), then at least download these songs... <br /> <br />By The Way <br />Universally Speaking <br />The Zephyr Song <br />Can't Stop <br />I Could Die For You <br />Throw Away Your Television <br /> <br />Overall, I'd tell you to buy the album any day, than to download just those songs, because I love everything about this album.
0156013983|5.0|I love this book. I have read this book in three different languages (german, english and french). It's a completley heartwarming story and not only for kids! This book has a lot of great quotes like:<br /><br />\\"On ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.\\"<br /><br />You really should read it!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I could go on and on praising the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but I'd rather just skip onto the review of my favorite songs... <br /> <br />1)Dani California- an excellent choice for a single. It has the traditional, or partly traditional, Red Hot Chili Pepper's funk sound to it. The chorus is insanely catchy, and you'll want to listen to it over and over again. <br /> <br />2)She's Only 18- I've fallen in love with the lyrics to this song, as well as the bass/guitar intro to this song. I could listen to this one all day. <br /> <br />3)Warlocks- Once again, the intro is catchy and makes you want to learn what they'll do next. \\"Everyone in the world adores ya..\\" <br /> <br />4)C'mon Girl- Has a different start, but awesome sounding nonetheless. Once again, the lyrics and vocals are nicely put. <br /> <br />5)21st Century- When the vocals come in on this song, you are instantly drawn to keep listening. I think this is the dance track of this album.  <br /> <br />6)She Looks To Me- Music just doesn't get any better than this song right here, period. <br /> <br />I could go on and gush about this album, but I think you can already tell how much I love it. If you're looking to buy one RHCP album, definitely By The Way, but if you have it already, definitely this one.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I`m a proud owner of all the star trek series and thought i would take a chance with the often bashed Enterprise.  I expected it to be horrible and badly acted but was pleasantly surprised.  I find it to be interesting, funny and well played out.  Almost realistic (or as realistic as one can get when talking about people flying around in space ships).  Effects are great and I found the storylines interesting.  I kept looking for what it was that bothered fans so much.  Sure, the Vulcans were a little too emotional for a people who weren`t supposed to be and the uniforms were a little strange but overall I liked it. The only issue I could see fans not liking was that it was too down to earth in that the sets were small and more submarine like rather than the sprawling niceties we are acostomed to (with the exception of the Defiant) and very dark as opposed to the brightness of the Enterprise or Voyager.  I believe that Enterprise, much like DS9, showed a grittier, darker edge to Star Trek and most fans like the everything is happy and easy to solve aspect of the Star Trek.  I personally believe that the darker aspect of Star Trek is the more interesting and think that is when the best writing comes out (ie DS9).  So, if you`re looking for Wesley Crusher or Q, this is not for you.  If you`re a fan of brooding Odos and dark storylines, I think you`ll like it.
B000001ELP|5.0|This is a fair example of growth. These are the Kiss members as musicians, not as a commercial product. The album concept is superb, as well as the lyrics and musical arrangements. This is an album I will never get tired of listening. It's brilliant, and you can't imagine that it was written by the same Kiss that wrote \\"Unmasked\\"!! \\"A World Without Heroes\\", my favorite track of the album is a magic song that takes you to the world of dreams, of heroes, knights and princes, very airy, very visual. It's a shame the album did not get the ranking that it deserves. It's one of the most underrated albums of all time and it shouldn't be! I think it can shake hands with Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and some other concept albums. It's a masterpiece to me.
1400034779|4.0|The simple rythym of this gentle story transported me back to the arms of southern Africa, whose embrace I am still firmly locked in despite having left for foreign shores over a decade ago.  The idiosyncrasies of life for Precious Ramotswe had a smile on my face that lasted the entire duration of the book.  It is an easy, although possibly hauntingly nostalgic read, and revealed enormous wit and talent on behalf on a very astute yet unassuming author.
B00005ASGG|4.0|Highly regarded John Ford western, in some ways it's fairly routine. Told in flashback, James Stewart is the young lawyer who comes to the wild town of Shinbone, which is being terrorized by Lee Marvin. John Wayne is a tough guy who befriends Stewart, and together they get rid of Marvin. They both fall in love with the same woman (Vera Miles); Stewart gets Miles, but it's Wayne's gunshot, from behind the scenes, that gets Marvin. Stewart goes on to Washington, fame, and fortune. Ford always worked in stereotypes and blatant sentimentality, and they are found here in force. But the nuances between characters, especially Miles and Wayne at the end, when you know she loves him but he makes her go with Stewart, are very well done. Andy Devine is likewise terrific as the chicken-hearted sheriff. Marvin is the epitome of evil, though sometimes he's a bit over the top. Ford's greatest asset - his outdoor photography - is totally lacking here; in fact, a lot of the picture is shot in the dark. There's a famous quote from the movie: \\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\\" That pretty much defined Ford's entire approach to moviemaking. It's a good movie, but not Ford's best.
B00005JOVH|3.0|Ok, in order for me to give my honest opinion I have to reflect on what I hated about this movie before going into what I loved. <br /> <br />I am an old school X Men fan.  I knew everyone's powers, names, real names, and back stories.  So, I was looking forward to Phoenix coming out, and expecially for them to tell Jean's story.  X Men, had they kept true to the story line from the comics, could have went on for years like Harry Potter or Superman.  It's one of the greatest comics EVER to me, because of the social issues that it masks with calling people \\"mutants\\" rather than say, \\"black\\" or \\"handicapped\\" or even \\"Jewish\\" - or, hey, here's one, a \\"terrorist.\\"  The idea behind X Men is that they are among us, and you won't always know who you're talking to or sitting next to. <br /> <br />That in mind, I expected to see carnage and all hell breaking loose once Phoenix emerged.  You already knew it would happen.  But since everyone who knows the comics is familiar with the love story and what tames Phoenix, I expected to see her in the end with Scott and the Professor, working with some new students at the academy. <br /> <br />No.  Instead I see Scott get killed off within the fisrt 15 minutes of the film, Storm's hair is CUT OFF (the character's trademark is her dam hair, how you gon' cut it off?!!), and Rogue - my favorite character because of how independent she was in the comics - my poor Rogue is contemplating getting rid of her powers to be closer to her boyfriend.  WTF is this new director doing?!!  Then they kill off Xavier.  How you gon' kill off the professor, and have Phoenix do it no less, as Magneto watches in amazement??  I was shocked.  Completely shocked. <br /> <br />The special effects in this movie are amazing, and the story line, while upsetting and strange at times, was very good.  The idea of being able to \\"cure\\" mutants was intriguing, especially when the mutants divided between those who were tired of standing out and being different, those who wanted to be what was considered normal, and the group Magneto was in charge of, who were offended by this \\"extermination\\" that was taking place.  To me, the best twist was when you discovered that this \\"cure\\" wasn't man made - it was in the form of a little boy, a mutant, who rendered whatever powers you had useless. <br /> <br />Overall, it honestly wasn't a bad movie.  It had an interesting ending and excellent acting.  I just really wish that they hadn't done some of the things in this one that they did.  I wanted to see more of Scott, Xavier, and less of Wolverine.  I wanted Rogue to come into her powers in this one and start showing some of her attitude that kept her popular with me.  Kelsy Grammer as Beast, by the way, was an excellent, albeit suprisingly, good choice. <br /> <br />I would say that it's worth watching.  I'm curious to see what they end up doing with the ending, since Magneto is not completely powerless. <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|3.0|Having read and loved Truman Capote's masterpiece In Cold Blood, I was eager to see the \\"story\\" behind the creation of this book.  In Capote, what I got was a performance and script so understated it was boring, dull, and slow.  There is no action or even a climax to the film.  Non-literary, non-intellectual, non-egghead types would be bored to death with the lack of tension and conflict in the film.  The film is about four brutal killings, but the murders are never re-enacted.  You see a shotgun blast from a window, hear a girl scream as she finds the bodies, see a killer going up the stairs with a rifle, and see a body lying on its side on the bed with blood on the wall, but this is not enough to bring the terrible events to life.<br /><br />However, if you are familiar with Capote and are in awe of In Cold Blood, you will probably enjoy the film.
B00003CXDD|5.0|If I can watch a movie several times over again and enjoy it; <br />thats a sign the movie has what it takes to connect. <br />This is pure great storytelling. Fun for the whole family. <br />Scenes, acting, plot are all wonderful. I have found <br />you cannot compare one movie to another because stories <br />have the same root structure under them. If I am drawn <br />into the adventure with the characters - the movie <br />did it's job, this is one of them. Worth the time <br />to watch.
068484267X|5.0|What's fascinating about Frank McCourt's story telling is that it is non-pretentious, honest, and humorous. This is a heart-warming chronicle of love for family, the struggle to survive the day-to-day battles with poverty, and dreams fulfilled. This is a story of a boy who matured into manhood early, owing to his desire to give his family a better life. It's such a joy to read this book, because as I've learned, a cheerful disposition and positive attitude, can motivate one to persevere and pursue one's cherished dreams even amidst difficulties.
B0000025CP|5.0|This is what Judas Priest had been building up to over their previous three albums, which had plenty of high points but some low points too.  However, there are no low points here.  Along with \\"British Steel\\", I consider this Priest's best album. <br /> <br />One very positive addition was the addition of drummer Les Binks (where is he now?).  His double-kick drumming that starts off \\"Exciter\\" is a direct antecedent of the \\"speed metal\\" movement of the 1980s. <br /> <br />Though the previous albums were good in their own right, they were still derivative of contemporaries like Black Sabbath and Deep Purple in places (and I'm not saying that's a bad thing!).  Here, except for a slight Sabbath flavour on \\"Saints In Hell\\", Priest at last find their own identity and their own sound, and from here on out, other bands would be influenced by them. <br /> <br />No ballads here either!  The controversial \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" alternates between gentle acoustic and crushing electric guitar but is still very heavy.  Rob (or was it still \\"Bob\\" or \\"Robert\\" at this stage in his career?) Halford's vocal tour-de-force is on this song. <br /> <br />This album, along with much of Thin Lizzy's work, set the standards for twin lead guitars.  Glenn Tipton and KK Downing play off each other effortlessly.  However, one minor gripe is that Ian Hill's bass could be louder; he's a good, no-frills bassist but doesn't get the recognition he deserves. <br /> <br />HIGH POINTS: \\"Exciter\\", \\"Saints In Hell\\", \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\", \\"Heroes End\\". <br /> <br />LOW POINTS: NONE! <br /> <br />Essential for any heavy metal collection.
B000001DYA|5.0|A few months back, I was up late checking out some music on the internet when I stumbled upon Blue Cheer. I remembered a few of their tunes from years back, but I had to listen again. WOW, I listened to one after the other. I was blown away! Back to current time. I read in the paper that Blue Cheer is coming to Cleveland, June 5 at the Beachland Ballroom. So I take my teenage kids and a few of their friends and go. I have to say, it was one of the best rock concerts I have ever been to, these guys rocked the house!<br /><br />After the show they mixed with the crowd, signed autographs, shook hands and were totally down to earth. If you like hard blues based rock, you have to have music of Blue Cheer in your collection to make it complete.<br /><br />enjoy!
1401302378|1.0|This book looked interesting from its reviews, but boy was it a disappointment.  Read a few pages, and you know that the writer is a testosterone driven journalist, jargon, hype, buzz explode off the pages, wild claims, amazing statistics.  Anderson is yet another wordsmith who has woven pop culture, pop sociology and pop marketing into an apocolyptic vision.<br /><br />\\"Almost everything sells at least once a month\\" says Anderson...Huh?  \\"The internet makes it cheap to reach more people\\"...Gee wizz.  \\"infinite demand\\"...what?  \\"Dramatically faster\\"...Duh!<br /><br />Anderson is someone who doesn't let facts and figures get in the way of a good story.<br /><br />Fact: innovation still takes 8 years to reach 50% of its peak level, whether it's broadband, internet, personal PCs, mobile technology whatever.<br /><br />Fiction: diffusion of innovation is accelerating.<br /><br />Fact: illusion of speed grows the closer you get to the details.<br /><br />Fact: resourcing a business in the early stages of innovation curve requires you to keep doubling your resources every few months (that's because of the shape of the curve, not the market accelerating).  This creates an illusion of acceleration.<br /><br />So how should you respond to this book as a business person?  Putting the inaccurate claims aside, it shows that fashion accessories, books and music, plus recycling of garage and loft contents, are taking place on the Internet more often, and that people are spending more leisure time searching for this stuff, and watching less TV as a consequence.  So media companies are worried.<br /><br />But if you want a serious book about innovation and portfolios, on making money from these trends, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Suggested reading:<br /><br />- Portfolio Management for New Products (ISBN: 0738205141)<br /><br />- Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949)<br /><br />- Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847)
B00005JP4W|1.0|Al Gore's thirty-seventh attempt to reinvent himself, become relevent in today's culture and climb into the 2008 presidential race is, as you can see from the reviews here, being wildly received by The Left and all of their associated minions.  <br /> <br />While the movie may be \\"incovenient\\", it has little relationship to the truth. <br /> <br />Inspite of predictions of global cooling many years ago from these same people, they have jumped off that horse and climbed on another.  <br /> <br />It is true that the global average surface temperature of the planet incread by 0.6 degrees C. over the course of the 20th century. However if fossil fuel burning is responsible for this tiny increase, why does half of the \\"warm up\\" occur between 1900 and 1945. Why isn't there significant warming in the second half of the century when so much more fuel was being burned? Hmmmmm? <br /> <br />Yet, Gore & company warn of coastal flooding as the glaciers melt. The \\"inconvenient truth\\" is that while some glaciers are melting, others are not. Some are growing! Note the report in 2005 by Norwegian, Russian and American scientists that Greenland's ice is thickening and not melting. (Ola Johannessen, et al. \\"Climate Change.\\" Science, November 2005) <br /> <br />\\"The Ice Caps are melting!! Sea levels will rise!!\\" Really? Such drivel shows a real lack of scientific understanding. Ice caps are after all, floating ice. Not a land mass. To see how water levels will rise try this little scientific experiment. Take a bowl. Fill it half full of water. Add a lot of ice cubes or a block of ice. Mark the level of the water once that is done. Let it melt. Note the water level has not risen because the ice melted. Duh!! <br /> <br />The predictions of global warming are based on computer models done by some scientists who have made a great living out of scaring the bejesus out of the rest of us. Those are the same type of models who told us in the 70's to prepare for global cooling and the returnof the Ice Age. Just as figures don't lie and liars can figure, a computer model can be made to produce any desired outcome that the programmer wants. And the Gore crowd wants doom, gloom and disaster. Coming right up!! <br /> <br />There is no question that the Gore movie is an impressive piece of propoganda. If you accept what he says at face value you will become as hopelessly fearful as many of the reviewers on here. However, Orson Wells was similarly successful for a brief period of time with a Mercury Theater radio broadcast concerning a Martian invasion. He scared a lot of people who thought they were listening to the real thing. His radio broadcast had about as much scientific basis as Gore's doomsday predictions about global warming.  <br /> <br />He is selling snake oil and there is no truth in his claims.
630587493X|1.0|This is the all-time WORST movie I've ever seen! I can't  <br />believe how stupid it was! How some people think this is great <br />film is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY beyond me! It's a total snore-fest! <br /> <br />Plus it had way too much sexual humor! <br /> <br />Don't waste your time on this awful movie!!
B00005JLKN|5.0|Like the silence of the lambs ,this movie is based on a novel,this movie was made to have the look of the original Dr. Lecter film , unlike Hannibal.Anthony Hopkins reprices the role who won an academy award for his brilliant and creepy interpretation.This is a prequel to silence of the lambs.  In this one a crazy psycho,who like Buffalo Bill kills people very carefully and with style,is on the loose.His name is the tooth fairy.The only way to stop him is to get help from Hannibal the Cannibal who is behind bars(actually a glass) for his crimes and cannibalism.This is a great movie!
B000AU9UYM|4.0|The strongest of the batman films, well made, well edited, superbly acted, truest to the heart of the dark knight.  Real good action flic.
B0000025DT|5.0|First, I want to start off by saying that this is probably one of the greatest albums that has ever been released in all of music history.  Every last song is fantastic.  Second, I have to also mention that if you like the Beach Boys and Pink Floyd, then you will absolutely love this album.  It is practically a combination of the two.  Particularly is this evident on their smash hit \\"Livin' Thing\\"--which interestly compares surfing to falling in love.  A wonderful mixture of Beach Boys lyrics and Pink Floyd spaciness. What I particularly enjoy about this album is that every song with its \\"air-filled\\" sound makes you feel like your at Venice Beach on a bright, sunny day.  This will take you back to the days when music was REALLY music, and it didn't have degrading lyrics like \\"pimp\\", \\"booty\\", or \\"hoe\\".  So, I encourage anyone who has never heard ELO before, definately give this album a try.  Even though it is a product of the 70's, you will still enjoy it.
B00000IP2L|3.0|My first experience with Zakk's playing was with Ozzy. Then on his \\"Boozed, Broozed & Broken Boned\\" DVD, in the interview extra he mentioned that Al DiMeola was one of his influences and this peaked my curiosity to check out his solo work. Three discs later, I can say that his output as a leader is consistent; he's a hell of a guitar player (not a great singer), and writes some heavy rock and roll songs. The only complaint I have is that this disc is LOUD, so much in fact, that distortion (not from the guitar) is audible and there is no dynamic range. Otherwise, a solid rock and roll disc.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|i'll keep it short, all i can say is, its an new and improved Rise against, all tracks are great more or less, if you are a fan of the old songs they've released, you will love this CD, one of my favorite cds of all time.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|If you want to see Brad Pitt dance around in a leather skirt w/ waxed legs, go ahead & watch Troy. If this doesn't sound too appealing for those of you w/ a delicate constitution, skip it.<br />As far as Orlando Bloom is concerned, he is a sniveling, overrated wimp. Helen looked like a prom queen; when I saw that blonde, pouting harlot try to act, it was extremely hard for me to believe the war was fought for her beauty.<br />For Friday night, pick something intelligent. Not a two-hour film about a horridly debauched culture.
B000679N96|3.0|I have recently been buying up the remastered, two-disc Cure CDs, and Three Imaginary Boys was my starting point.  <br /> <br />As an a teenage American, I have missed out on the vast majority of The Cure's work -- as it came out, that is -- and certainly missed Three Imaginary Boys, due to my national status. <br /> <br />That said, the closest I can get to comparing audio quality is by listening to Boys Don't Cry (the outtake from TIM's second disc) and 10:15 Saturday Night from the Staring at the Sea collection, and then the TIM reissue. The difference is superb, which brings me to my next. <br /> <br />The omission of Killing An Arab (admittedly, it was never my favourite song from this period, but it has grown on me considerably since my first listening long ago, now to the point of my quite liking it) is an outrage. Call me picky, but I would like to be able to listen to songs like Boys Don't Cry, 10:15 Saturday Night, Killing An Arab, and Jumping Someone Else's Train without a significant change in audio quality. Unfortunately, because Killing An Arab was omitted, I am forced to. I do not know the reason the track was kept off, but I suspect it was due to the title, which, to those who know nothing of the song, seems hateful. Well, the problem is, it's not a hateful song, and that it is excluded from the CD rubs me the wrong way in a big way. <br /> <br />I quite like the Studio Demo version of Boys Don't Cry (not more than the master, understand), whose opening sounds quite like Killing An Arab from the Concert album (which is absolutely superb -- I very much recommend it). <br /> <br />If Killing an Arab had been included on this, I would have given it four stars; but, as it is not, it receives three. I like this album, but I feel it lacks the listenability of every album that follows it.  <br /> <br />A very solid first effort in one of the best carreers in musical history.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|If you cried your eyes out in DITD then this CD will wrench your heart as well.  I had this CD in my car and found myself crying non stop!!! Probally not the best thing to do while driving?  I even had a friend borrow my car once with this cd in it and he confided to me that after a few songs he started to cry as well..and he hates Bjork!!!  In a nutshell - YOU WILL CRY when you hear this cd AND keep tissues in your car when you listen to this cd.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|First off I would like to state that AFI is NOT emo. They never have been and they most certainly arent now. And if thats what you classify them as, then you do not have a clue as to how to classify music.    Decemberunderground, in my opinion, is much better than Sing the Sorrow. The new album takes on much more of a Alternative Rock influence with true Hardcore-Punk sound and old school 70's Punk Rock guitar riffs. Theres even some good Hardcore-Punk screams in here. To say that this album is bad is just wrong, because it is not. Every track on this album is a good one. Theres even a cool little intro/vocal track thing for those of us who like that kind of stuff. All in all its a great listen, and for me, a change up in my usual tastes. I'll also say that if you were a bigger fan of the stuff before Sing the Sorrow (I'm a fan of their later works) then this album you may not like.
068987474X|4.0|This book contains some common sense advice that's presented in a humorous way.   <br /> <br />My only problem with it is that the book seems to be geared toward Manhattan city types who regularly frequent bars and clubs.  A \\"Sex and the City\\" atmosphere is assumed, but the dating scene across America does in fact differ.  <br /> <br />In particular, many parts of this book would be inapplicable to people with strong religious faith or people who don't believe in jumping in the sack on the third date.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|Although Cryptopsy may not be as good as Nile or Necrophagist, they certainly dont fail to impress. Once Was Not is a great album, and although at times it may sound a bit too much like some of Nile's work, it still gets you pumped and leaves you amazed. The guitars are simply wicked and can cotend with the best of them. This album has great drumming also. The beats are very original and sometimes leave you wondering \\"How in the hell...?! Can the human body really move that fast?\\" HAHA! The only thing that really bugs me on this album is sometimes Dan Greening's (AKA Lord Worm) vocals seem a little awkward...I cant really put my finger on it, but what is TRULY awesome is the spoken word lyrics put into some of the songs. Thats something that Nile, nor Necrophagist has done in the work. So kudos to Cryptopsy for that. Hell, kudos for Cryptopsy for just being...well...awesome!
B000000H5K|5.0|album #4 of the big four albums (the pinacle of Sepultura's career), and the last before the descent of their popularity following the departure of Max, singer/guitarist, main songwriter, and founding member of Sepultura. some Sepultura fans love this album and other ones hate it. it mainly has to do with the inclusion of the ethnic Brazilian world music element that is so prominent with this album. from the tribal percussion to the Portuguese chanting, to the lyrics that focus on the \\"roots\\" of Sepultura's Brazilian heritage. for some people, it just strays too far from the traditional thrash metal foundation that was the band's core from the early days. there's even a hint of \\"nu-metal\\" influence in the songs (no doubt a result of Ross Robinson's involvement in producing the album - he worked on the first Korn album). nevertheless, this album is extremely heavy, and simplistic at the same time. its bare-bones metal boiled down to the minimalistic, basic element. the riffs are simple, and the beats are solid... several months after this album, Max's stepson was killed in an auto accident, and this incident was a catalyst in the severing of ties between Max and the rest of the band. Max would go on to form Soulfly (their first album almost sounds like Roots part 2), and the remaining members would continue with Max's replacement Derrick Green, to create the Sepultura album, Against.
B000002H2H|5.0|In my opinion Ride the Lightning was Metallica's greatest. Master of Puppets is awesome too, but just not Ride the Lightning. This album is just relentless Thrash, and although it doesnt have the instant Thrash classic Battery on it, it still sports enough energy and ferocity to top Master of Puppets. This Metallica back in their prime (we all miss those days dont we?) and if you want to see how things really went down back in those days then pick this up. It is a must, along with Master of Puppets, for any Metal collection. Speed, anger, and adrenaline are what this album is all about. No acoustics like on Master of Puppets or ...And Justice for All. This was before they started adding that to their music. So what you get here is Metallica at their Thrashiest (with the exception of Kill 'Em All). Remember to look for this when building up your Metal collection or when you're just looking for great music.
B000000H3W|5.0|#2 of Sepultura's big four albums of their career (Beneath The Remains, Arise, Chaos AD, and Roots). it contains killer tracks like Desperate Cry, Arise, and Dead Embryonic Cells. an awesome thrash metal album and probably one of the best the came out in the early 90's. after this one, they would continue to evolve with the massive Chaos AD album a few years later...
B000EMGAOY|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have always been an enjoyable band and a good source of musical stability. Stadium Arcadium just didnt quite live up to my expectation. <br /> <br />This album is mostly slower more mellow songs. Which is fine, and very relaxing. I would have just liked them to have changed it up a little bit speed wise. Thats the only thing that really hindered it for me. All in all this is a very solid, enjoyable, and relaxing album (also very good for makeout sessions lol), but just not their best. Im very pleased though, and it was worth the money.
B000000H8B|5.0|the bottom line is, Beneath The Remains is one of Sepultura's \\"big four\\" albums. and by that I mean, this was the beginning of the peak of Sepultura's thrash metal powers. their first 2 albums, Morbid Visions and Schizophrenia were merely prequels to the Brazilian thrash metal greatness of Beneath The Remains. and it would only get better from here. it continued with Arise, then Chaos AD, and finally with Roots. these 4 albums are probably some of the greatest albums that came out on Roadrunner records from the late 80's to the mid 90's. from there, Sepultura's career kinda decended slightly (with the departure of Max), and has been riding a straight plateau ever since.

B000000H4V|5.0|album #3 of Sepultura's peak of their career. it began with Beneath The Remains, then Arise, and now Chaos AD. they keep getting better and better with each album. some standout tracks include: Refuse/Resist, Slave New World, and Territory. they also managed to make an MTV video for each of these 3 songs. this is probably the most powerful and angry album of their career. after this, they would use their ethnic Brazilian heritage as inspiration to create the legendary Roots album (and the last of their peak albums).
B00005JNQA|4.0|My first thought about seeing this movie, was that I did not want to see Nicole Kidman again.  But while on a cruise, this Spring, The Interpreter was playing and decided that a \\"free\\" ticket was a good reason to see it.  I like suspence movies and in all cases of S.Pollack, cerebral is central in his fillms.  Sean Penn's acting is like Johnny Depp's, insightful and extremely interesting.  I probably won't buy a copy of this DVD, but I did enjoy the movie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Basically, \\"Firefly\\" was a sci-fi television show about a ragtag crew of misfits in a junky spaceship at the far edges of civilized space 500 years from now. A fascinating mixture of space, cowboy, pirate movie, comedy, and drama, with brilliant writing and enjoyable actors, it's sort of like the story of what Han Solo might have been before Star Wars.  Or what the last several Star Treks should have been like, except they didn't have the luminous Josh Whedon as creator. It doesn't hurt that the captain and crew are on not-so-friendly terms with the Alliance of Planets that wants all of the 'verse to conform to norm.... Those of us who are on the side of the underdog and the dissenter can appreciate that. <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\", the show, was cancelled after one season, but its loyal fans, who call themselves 'Browncoats' (after the Independents who fought against the Alliance) kept the hope alive. They believed, as the captain of Serenity, Malcolm Reynolds, that the Independents' side \\"maybe have been the losing one -- I'm still not convinced it was the wrong one.\\"   Joss Whedon fought tooth and nail and finally got \\"Serenity\\", the movie, made.   It just proves what 'Captain Universe' in \\"Serenity\\", the movie, says: \\"They can't stop the signal, Mal. They can never stop the signal.\\"  <br /> <br />I had not seen the TV show when I first saw the movie. While I didn't catch all of the inside jokes, I was rapt, immediately. The plot is engaging, the characters fascinating, the visuals and the world ruggedly beautiful. Whedon and his cast were able to make me feel invested in the movie from the first few minutes on, and I never felt let down - a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience!  I've since seen the show and the movie several times, and have joined the ranks of the Browncoats. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or the TV show, you are missing out. This is one movie which will give you its money's worth, even if you are buying it \\"blindly\\".
0060595183|5.0|Hmm Timothy Leary; Aldous Huxley; Robert Anton Wilson; David Icke; Terrance Mckenna; Aleister Crowley... <br /> <br />Myself??? <br /> <br />What do these people all have in common <br /> <br />Well other than Icke and wilsons (my self as well) obsession with fringe and humerous conspriacy theories that people mistake as paranoia; they have all taken brain change drugs. <br /> <br />Without going into detail; into Mckenna DMT experiences; Learys and Wilsons Trips on LSD; my own morning glory trips; Ickes Ayahuasca; and Huxleys Peyote extract mesaline. Dont know what Crowley Took other than coke... <br /> <br />Now for the book: <br /> <br />This book really brought me in touch with many different inter connected things. I had already read Brave New World in high school and then in 2005 as a refresh and found it enlightening. go and look at my other reviews on utopian / distopian novels. In particular the Handmaids Tale By Margaret Atwood.  <br /> <br />But also the world of conspiracies that i have looked at over the years that Icke and Wilson have put forward. it was only a matter of time before i found out that huxley took a trip; into himself and became a shaman. or maybe one of the first neurologists. as talked about by learys 'Change Your Brain'. <br /> <br />I find it most exciting that these normal (well not so much leary and Mckenna with his High Voice) and dynamic people (leary and Mckenna are dynamic tho) are going against the system and the false war on psychedelic drugs and have made a stand. <br /> <br />'You will not go crazy; you will become awake' <br /> <br />When asked whether Buddha was enlightened he replied \\"I am awake\\" <br /> <br />I am not going to go into detail; but read this book. <br /> <br />It made me realise as i am studying ecology at the moment that indian hemp (W1) has a higher catagory than morning glory seeds do (W2). yet what morning glory contains... the seeds to the inner and true experience to enlighten your higher neurologicalcircuits. <br /> <br />Get this book; hitch yourself for a ride on the brain change wagon and set yourself free from the system... <br /> <br />Do what thou wilt... <br /> <br />Amen
B0000026NC|3.0|1988's \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" is Pink Floyd's double live album documenting their tour for \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason,\\" their first album & tour without bassist/singer/composer Roger Waters. Overall, it's a very good live set, with guitarist/singer David Gilmour & company delivering solid versions of Floyd favorites like \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" \\"Money,\\" \\"One Of These Days,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and stuff from \\"Momentary Lapse\\" like \\"Learning To Fly\\" and \\"On The Turning Away.\\" However, it isn't a perfect live recording. For starters, Gilmour, for a lot of the album, sounds like he's growling through the songs rather than singing them. Also, the female back-up singers' \\"woo-woo\\" chorus on \\"Money\\" just sounds silly, and while touring bassist Guy Pratt does an admirable job filling in for Waters on bass, his co-lead vocal with Gilmour on \\"Run Like Hell\\" is pretty poor. Still, through it all, the music remains classic Pink Floyd all the way, and the sound quality is excellent, too. Though not a concert masterpiece, \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" is still a good live album from the Floyd.
B00008WT5M|5.0|I think Razors Edge is one of the best recordings by AC/DC.  My personal favorites are Are you ready, Fire your guns, Shot of love.  This cd is equal to or better than Back in Black which is #5 on the all time best selling list!
0780619609|4.0|This movie has excellent action and costumes, but it still has that early 90's pop culture dated look.  Fifteen years later, I finally realize how annoying it is when any one of the turtles uses the word \\"Cowabunga.\\"<br /><br />The movie's plot is simple, and it doesn't have bad words and things like that, so it's a really good movie for kids.  I really love the new mutants Tokka and Razar.  Real dumb strong monsters always make the movie for me.  Shredder's a good villian as well, seeking a horrible revenge on the turtles at all costs, and destroying himself inside and out in the process.<br /><br />It's a shame David Warner's role as the TGRI scientist is so forgettable.  If you want to see him at his best, watch the Star Trek Next Generation episode entitled \\"Chain of Command: Part 2.\\"  He really shines in that.
038542471X|3.0|So you look at this book on a shelf. Black cover, solid title, written by none other than the infamous John Grisham. Makes you REALLY want to read the book. I'm not saying i judged it by it's cover, but i read it anyways. I have to say this book was extremely well written, Grisham did a great job of background information about everythign under the sun, and it kept me so eager to read and figure out what happens next. Grisham certainly leads you on though... the beginning of the book there's some rediculously unlucky 11 year old kid and his soon-to-be-in-eternal-shock kid brother witness the suicide of a New Orleans lawyer defending a killer on the outskirts of Memphis, Tennessee. The book takes you through all these breathtaking experiences that follow this kid and his cool lawyer Reggie over the next week. So you think, \\"Oh, this kid's gonna get hit by the mafia\\" or at least some showdown.... but this story builds, and builds to what you think will be an amazing outcome, but really just kind of drops off. I was disappointed, thinking coooool this is such an awesome book! And then just like that, the book ended. Done. I guess you can't really ask much when the protagonist is an 11-year old boy, but i think Grisham could have written a much better ending, one that totally pulls you in, instead it was like the story just drifted away. Quite an astounding book, even though it was an easy read. All amounting to nothing.
B00004D3C1|5.0|Instead of talking about every song, I'll jsut say this--this CD is awesome, and is probably Fu Manchu's second or third best album, depending on which style you like; the old Fu Manchu with Eddie and Ruben ('91-'96), or the new Fu Manchu with Brant and Bob ('97-'04).    With \\"King of the Road,\\" Fu Manchu dives in completely and gives itself totally to the new sound for the first time.  Gone are the dark, sludgy sounds we heard as recently as \\"Grendel\\" and \\"Anodizer\\" on the last album, and the same sound which permeated \\"In Search of\\" and \\"Daredevil.\\"  Now, we get pure rock songs, with that signature FU wall of power chord pounding guitars, like \\"Blue Tile Fever,\\" \\"Hell on Wheels,\\" \\"Over the Edge\\" and \\"Boogie Van.\\"  These are the best songs on the CD, in my opinion, but truly every song on this disc is catchy, loud, and satisfying.  They can be compared roughly to earlier songs \\"Urethane,\\" \\"Mongoose (demo version),\\" \\"Action is Go,\\" and \\"Hogwash.\\"       They've dropped the sludgy sound.  It still sounds like they've got 22 guitar players, they've just dropped the dark riffs.  If you're cool with that, Fu is cool with you, I guess.

For those who want to feel good after watching a movie then this one is a sure winner.

B000063UR1|5.0|I write this review out of the memories of when I saw it back in the early 70s when I was just a kid..<br /><br />The title in spanish was Naves Misteriosas (strange ships) and with that title I tried searching in Amazon, finally some ilumination struck me and went to Google and found the english title.<br /><br />This movie had a tremendous effect on me, similar to Disney's movies in the way you are presented to a cruel reality (if you think those 60s disney movies were for kids, think again) in which struggle from madness and oppression is the fate of us all..<br /><br />Tha last forests of the world are floating in space ships that carry them as terrarium.. this greenpeace guy, well maybe thats a adjective too violen, lets say this flower-generation guy loves his plants and the helpful robots that reseamble mini-tv with legs and arms. Then an absurd order is received: blow the forests (run bambi.. Run!!!) and the other mindless idiots, well, they just follow order.. thats too much for our heroe to bear so in a shakesperian wrath he eliminates his companions and stays alone with one forest... a tragic end can be deduced...<br /><br />Saw it once never seen it again because I never saw it displayed again.. 30 years later it still fresh on my memory and made me an enviromentalist forever.
B000F1IQNM|2.0|Except for the fact that the characters don`t break out into song at regular intervals, \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is a weird hybrid made up of equal parts \\"Mary Poppins\\" and \\"The Sound of Music\\" (hereafter to be referred to as MP and TSOM), with an uglied-up Emma Thompson replacing the anything-but-ugly Julie Andrews in the lead role.<br /><br />Miss McPhee is a British nanny with magical powers who arrives unannounced at the doorstep of one Mr. Brown (MP), a widower with seven unruly children (TSOM) who, due to business and financial pressures (MP) and grief over his wife`s death (TSOM), has been rather neglectful of his progeny of late (both MP and TSOM).  The children have successfully driven away all the town's employable nannies with their precocity and unruly behavior (MP and TSOM), but could they have finally met their match in the mysterious Nanny McPhee?  There's also a subplot about Brown bringing home an odious woman to be a new mother to the children and their attempts to sabotage the effort that has \\"The Sound of Music\\" written all over it.  And the final scene is such an unabashed and shameless rip-off of the closing moments (albeit sans umbrellas and kites) of \\"Mary Poppins\\" that I can't believe there aren't grounds for a copyright-infringement lawsuit here.<br /><br />Since \\"Nanny McPhee\\" has stolen virtually every one of its plot points from those two previously mentioned classics, it's hard not to weigh this film against the originals and to find \\"Nanny McPhee\\" wanting in every respect.  This is a drab, cheerless film filled with overdrawn caricatures and unappealing visuals.  Nanny McPhee, replete with uni-brow, hairy warts and a prominent buck tooth, is herself so physically repulsive that she is liable to give impressionable youngsters nightmares for months afterwards.  And buried under all that restrictive and distracting makeup, Emma Thompson can't even begin to deliver anything like a full-bodied, well-rounded performance.  Of course, since she herself wrote the screenplay (based on the books by Christianna Brand), she probably has no one to blame but herself for her predicament.  Pity, instead, poor Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury, fine performers who seem to be marking time waiting for some better roles to come along.<br /><br />My big question when it comes to \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is why settle for this cheap knock-off when the originals are readily available and so much better?screenplay (based on the books by Christianna Brand), she probably has no one to blame but herself for her predicament.

Es una reunion de los amigos que George hizo en vida, desde la epoca de Hamburgo con los beatles, ahi estan Billy Preston, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Ravi Shankar, Jeff Lyne, entre otros que tocan las canciones que George compuso, en donde plasmo lo que sentia y pensaba. La apertura del concierto esta a cargo de la musica india dirigida por la bella hija de Ravi Shankar, Anushka, magnifica y mistica musica interpretada por musicos selectos de origen indu, acompañados tambien por seccion de cuerdas, y al finalizar, la guitarra de Clapton que hacen de esa primera parte grandiosa. No vayas a pensar que es aburrida, si te gusta la Musica de verdad te gustara esta parte del show. La presencia de Paul y Ringo en el escenario es nostalgica y emocionante, los BI-tles juntos otra vez, acompañados por la presencia espiritual de John y George. Es un DVD que recomiendo comprar para todos los fans, por momentos es triste, es alegre, es impresionante el sonido, de muy buena calidad, al finalizar de verlo y oirlo solo podras decir...Gracias George por tu presencia en este mundo y por tu musica, Hare Krishna, Hare Rama. Un dato adicional y que Paul menciona en el show, con la participacion de Dhani Harrison pareciera que el mismisimo George estuviera tocando y que sus amigos hubieran envejecido menos el.
B000E33VWW|5.0|No review I write here is going to top that of C.B. Collins, Jr.'s spotlight review - that's about the best summary of a movie I've read on amazon.com.  I especially like the articulation of the element of the film I had been trying to wrap words around: that director Bennett Miller expertly juxtaposes the descent of Capote with the ascent of best friend, the unassuming Harper Lee.<br /><br />What's truly fascinating when watching 'Capote' is realizing that after 'In Cold Blood,' Capote *never* finished another piece of work.  He suffered through 22 years of complete artistic constipation.  By the time most people of my age got to know him, Capote was a freak show - a drunken, pill-popping sham who subsisted only through talk show appearances.<br /><br />Director Miller, screenwriter Dan Futterman and biographer Gerald Clarke make clear that 'In Cold Blood' scarred Capote.  He literally sold his soul to mold and finish the book he wanted.  He never recovered.  Miller depicts the essence of the roots of Capote's long, slow fall into irrelevance.<br /><br />And for all the talk about Hoffman's performance (he deserved that Oscar), the real breakout story here is Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith.  His is a truly mesmerizing performance.
