0593070631|5.0|I live in America and was worried I wouldn't be able to get the new Mcfly Autobiography... luckily I was able to find it on Amazon.  I was hesitant to purchase the book for fear of never actually receiving it, but the end result was quite the contrary.  I received my book ahead of schedule and in mint condition!  I also sped through the book and it was amazing, I absolutely recommend to all of my fellow Galaxy Defenders.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good read.  No big surprises, but plot was interesting. Grisham's books tend to be similar, so you have to enjoy the lawyer themed stories that he writes. Overall, an enjoyable, easy to read book.
B008Y7EYSK|3.0|Excited to see Daniel Radcliffe moving forward in his career. Fine actor, makes any role believable even a creepy one. Creepy not in a in your face way but subtle, low key way.Movie is bit sluggish but flows coherently to a surprising conclusion. Be prepared to be sad and happy at the same time. A good but not great movie for a couple of hours.

B008NA3I30|2.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"Take This Waltz\\" (A Drama DVD review)...It was ok.<br /><br />Genre: 6.5 Movie: 4<br /><br />Keep an eye on \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook<br /><br />What's it about?<br />A happily married woman falls for the artist who lives across the street. Margot is no longer sure if she's happy in her marriage or if she'd be happier with her fantasies with Daniel.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />It felt like I was going to the dentist...I watched it because it felt like I had to.  The acting was good, but the story was so saddening that the funny parts weren't all that funny.  It was supposed to be sexually graphic, but there was really only one part that was.  If you like a really depressing love story, then this movie is for you.
B009B4ZEMA|3.0|*3.5 stars*<br /><br />So the pattern continues. First, Christina released \\"Your Body\\", an irresistible single, and then its accompanying album falls way below the expectations that were set because of that one song. So far, Pink, Carly Rae Jepsen, and even Taylor Swift have all delivered their 2012 sets in the exact same way. But usually Xtina breaks the mold and overshadows her pop peers. But such is not the case with \\"Lotus\\". Its title speaks of rebirth, and there's no denying that Christina has made quite a few changes since her 2010 flop \\"Bionic\\". She has since divorced husband Jordan Bratman, she took up a position on \\"The Voice\\", she starred in her first film role in the critically panned \\"Burlesque\\", and then there's the time she botched the National Anthem at the Superbowl. All of these events set the stage for a comeback, and indeed at first glance it would seem that way.<br />In 2002, critics highly reprimanded Christina for her topless album cover of her artistic and commercial breakthrough \\"Stripped\\". But, with the cover of \\"Lotus\\", which leaves even less to the imagination, \\"Stripped\\" seems like a strip tease. Christina was just taunting and flirting with sexuality back then compared to the way she bares it all here. From the smash \\"Your Body\\" to the sultry track \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\", her sexiness has taken the forefront here more than any other album she has produced. It even beats \\"Back to Basics\\", which had its fair share of innuendo. But just like \\"Stripped\\", the sex appeal is very apparent, but it does not overshadow the music. In fact, the bulk of this record is not even about sex or body image, it's about the message of the lotus flower, and how it is indestructible. Starting with the enchanting \\"Lotus Intro\\", moving into the bland \\"Army of Me\\", and to the compelling piano ballad \\"Blank Page\\", the defiant marching-drum beats take the center and are so present to the point of making this tracklist seem to just flow into one another, resulting inthe majority of this album to sound indistinct.<br />There are only 13 songs, and the album as a whole clocks in at a mere 47 minutes, but it's not a three-quarter hour you will remember. The first listen is disappointing, so \\"Lotus\\" requires multiple spins in order to fully consume the tracks as individuals. It's a good thing that this album comes across as a unified set of tracks, but they are so blurry it is hard to tell one track from the other. Fans have waited 10 years for Xtina to return to the brash and no-apology pop of \\"Stripped\\", and while \\"Lotus\\" is a comeback, and an album far more addictive than \\"Bionic\\", it pales in comparison to its 2002 ancestor. And while \\"Lotus\\" will definitely avoid the harsh criticism \\"Stripped\\" received, it is also not as good because it is not as bold and controversial as \\"Stripped\\" was. Christina is not known for playing it safe, and \\"Lotus\\" unfortunately, does. But don't miss \\"Your Body\\" and \\"Blank Page\\", both of which shine so bright they completely diminish the rest of the album.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" (A Fantasy/Horror DVD review)...Loved IT!!<br /><br />Genre: 8 Movie: 6<br /><br />Become a fan of \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook<br /><br />What's it about?<br />Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />This movie does to Vampire Films what Resident Evil did for Zombie films...it commercialized it.  I found it exciting and fun to watch, But it wasn't for the horror movie fan as much as the comic book or fantasy buff.  It reminded me of \\"Van Helsing\\" or 80's metal music...great entertainment but not as hardcore as it could have been.
B008WCP2KG|2.0|What can I say about this movie? Well let's see \\"horrible\\" & 'terrible\\" come to mind... and the kicker is that it could have been a pretty good one...  Not bad because of the content either, after all, didn't we love the gritty, dirty movie called \\"Boogey Nights\\" starring Burt Reynolds as an old washed up porn producer?? Well, I did anyway........ The main problem was having Warner Bros and the producer/director shooting most of the movie in \\"yellow\\"...what was that about?? Some sort of Andy Warhol twist on art noveau shooting??  Hey, in case someone forgot to tell the producer the movie is about male strippers....period. Anyone that pans this movie because of lack of a good \\"script\\" is totally out of touch with what \\"B\\" Movies are all about... and this one starred a bunch of studs almost nude... so you need to know that before you rent or buy it. If you still complain after that you know what?? ..... what were you thinking?? A good \\"B\\" movie is always good to break up the typical stuff (I would have said that different) out of Hollywood as most of it is all action and CGI effects.  Very little time to get to see \\"the other side\\" of a story or the \\"personal  life\\" of someone that most of us would never ever dream of becoming.... As in \\"why would I want to do that...?\\"  So seeing something that is so far removed my  our \\"everyday lives\\"  is a good changeup once in a while... but this movie missed the mark on so many levels. Too bad, because it had a very good cast of characters... and I think that characters is a better term than \\"actors\\" considering the film.

0765348276|1.0|I read it out of some grim dedication to finishing the books in the Humble Bundle. Don't bother.<br /><br />The 'narrator' is just the author, and this is a sad, dull power fantasy with almost no redeeming features.<br />The narrator (we're meant to believe) is smart, funny, an incredible soldier, irresistable to women. The narrator rises from Private to Captain in less than a year and plays a pivotal role in literally every battle. The narrator gets hot for a six year old, and he is 75. But it's ok! Implanted memories in an adult body or something!<br /><br />Featureless, hollow characters holding incredibly long but shallow conversations are the main part of the book. The brief, uninteresting battle scenes are described with basically a list of actions like 'the alien stabbed her in the chest with two blades' with absolutely no emotional impact. I'm not sure why I read to the end, I guess out of morbid fascination. I wanted to see if the author would deny himself anything in his novel-length powertrip. The answer was no. The book ends with the main character universally loved.<br /><br /> I'm pretty sure the Mass Effect games had deeper writing than this, and that's really saying something.
B002PJN59M|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was in junior high. (Pretty much since it was released)  It's a great story...  great film...  And MOST of the Arthurian bases are covered here.  Being a big fan of the Arthur myth, I know what's accurate & what is not.  Excalibur DOES Hollywoodize the story, combining characters & switching some events that certain characters do & giving them to others.  But it is still a great story, well told, with great acting, good costumes & plenty of swords & sorcery, and not \\"corny\\" sorcery either.  I highly recommend it!  If for no other reason than to see Patrick Stewart & Liam Neeson very early in their careers!! And it still dates well also!

1469984202|2.0|I really tried to get into this book.  I read/skimmed through the first 180 pages before anything remotely interesting happened.  The writer is pretty good, but what I really cared about is what happens outside the silo.  I kept reading and REALLY skimming through pages hoping they'd get out and DO SOMETHING or FIND SOMETHING.  Maybe it was just me........... apparently a lot of folks loved this book.  I found it very slow.  The entire book could have been condensed into the first 50 pages and then move on from there.  To each his own I guess.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I'm a Tim Burton fan even after watching this movie.  The visuals and cast could not overcome the dull, uninspired script.

I did not put down until i finished..always intriqued with anything involving war time saga or events...Many americans have no clue what it was like during any war.. great read, a page turner for sure!!

B009ERK1T0|5.0|Praise the Music Jesus for bringing us this Deftones recording! Having only picked it up this afternoon I'm on my fourth pass through this CD as I write this review. In a world full of Top 40 drudgery where a blatant quagmire of mundane so-called rock stations play the same thing over and over it is comforting to know that Deftones have not let us down record after record. You know when you hear their music because you feel it. This CD is as potent as they get and I can only hope they continue to make their trademark sound go on for many more years. Soon to be 56 this music keeps me feeling young and there are but a few bands left that I cannot wait to go out buy the newest product by them. Thank you Deftones for another great one!<br />* Do not copy CD's...it is the evidence of a band's hard work and you'd not want someone to steal from you.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it! I wish the last book was coming out sooner than May 2013! I really think this was better than 50 shades of Grey.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Ordinarily, I'd love something wacko like this.  I read it once--disliked it.  Read it again to try to better understand it--hated it.  It is a verbal assault, and unless you are a masochistic reader, avoid the book...see the movie instead.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|So far I'm not that impressed. Season 1 had a much better storyline until the last episode which was a bomb and major disappointment. I love Jessica Lange and she is excellent in both Seasons which is mostly why I continue watching.
B00913DPW2|5.0|The Haunt is one of the best point and click (or in this case tap) I've encountered on the Kindle.  It reminds me of old school PC point and click games where you could lose yourself in the game and obsess over figuring out the puzzles while still unraveling a twisted storyline.  Though it isn't as intricate as some of the classics in interactive horror story games such as Shivers or Phantasmagoria, this game is definitely taking droid/kindle gameplay in the right direction for people who enjoy involving, storydriven games as an alternative to quick (but fun) games such as Angry Birds. It is especially noteworthy considering that this is an enticing game held in the palm of your hand to be a welcome and encompassing diversion anywhere.  Looking forward to The Haunt 2 when it is available.  Keep up the good work!

B005FITIGO|5.0|I didn't think it could be done.  How do you craft an entertaining film about a financial crisis brought about by liar loans, non-existent regulations, securities no one understands, and a financial sector run amok?  Director J.C. Chandor's Margin Call manages to tell this backstory and convey the vast greed at the heart of the system through an entertaining and superbly acted thriller that focuses on one firm.  Jeremy Irons' portrayal of the firm's CEO is wickedly compelling, but the rest of the cast is also excellent.  One of the most entertaining films I've seen in the past year.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This was truly a work of fiction.  Fiction to the extent of not being plausible. Readers like to be led into the plot of the story to think this could teally have happened, but this was so bizzare that no one could remotely believe the sequences of events and characters. John Grisham, you can,and have, done better.  I have read and retained all of your books (hard copy) but the Racketeer is a disappointment.

B003JYMF8Y|2.0|I'm begrudgingly giving this 2 stars out of respect for George Romero in much the same way the Academy of Motion Picture & Sciences doles out the occasional Academy Award based on someone's body of work rather than what they've actually been nominated for that year. I can only hope that if Romero is going to do another zombie movie, the next one isn't as laborious, and dare I say, stupid. He seems to be lowering the bar on the zombie genre, a bar that he set rather high with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Sadly, that bar has been creeping downward ever since, and watching this movie, one wonders how much lower can Romero's bar go? That said, if he were to make another, I'll be there even if others around him continue to raise the genre to new heights.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Only had the opportunity to play this once, but found it to be a quality product with good graphics and sound.
B000FC10MU|3.0|I have had several people recommend Neil Gaiman's novels to me. I am familiar with his work in comics mostly on 'The Sandman' so I was keen to finally read one of his books. Maybe my expectations were too high, or I just picked the wrong book to start with. I just wasn't that impressed with 'American Gods'.<br /><br />The premise was certainly worthy enough. The idea is that as immigrants move to a new country (in this case America) they bring their gods with them. Then as time elapses the gods lose their power as their followers' devotion wanes.<br /><br />The book follows Shadow as he is released from jail and falls in with a drifter called Mr. Wednesday. Mr. Wednesday is actually the leader of the Asgardians, Odin, who as is the wont of all gods in this new land, has fallen on hard times. He resorts to petty cons and seducing waitresses and cashiers. Mr. Wednesday recruits Shadow to help him recruit the other fading deities into an army to fight the emerging American gods (technology, credit cards, cars, etc.)<br /><br />The book mainly chronicles Shadow's and Wednesday's efforts to recruit other Old Gods to their cause. Again, the premise is very interesting but I thought the execution suffered. At various intervals, Gaiman will give us an intermission anecdote of how a god arrived in the New World via the beliefs of an immigrant. The problem is that Gaiman then fails to link these immigrants to the main narrative. Also, he will tell the story of how a god comes to the New World but again fails to include that god in the main narrative. This interrupts the flow of the story and gives it a disjointed feel.<br /><br />Most of the action is Wednesday and Shadow traveling the back roads of Middle America recruiting allies and preparing for the final battle. On the eve of the battle, Wednesday is killed and Shadow undergoes a trial he is not expected to survive. During the course of his ordeal he learns that he is Odin's son and that Odin and Loki have been pulling a con to induce the Old Gods to fight the new. As the final battle gets underway, Shadow returns and convinces them to call it off because the resulting slaughter would only play into Odin and Loki's hands.<br /><br />The development of the Old Gods characters and Shadow are by far the strongest part of the book. Gaiman doesn't spend much time developing the pantheon of the New Gods which is a shame. I think it would have provided balance to the book. He could have cut the 'Coming to America' stories and instead devoted that space to defining the pantheon of the New Gods.<br /><br />Other prominent themes are cons and sleight of hand and coin tricks which is meant to reflect the deceitful nature of religion.con to induce the Old Gods to fight the new.

B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver makes statistical forecasting INTERESTING. That's very hard to do. His voice is authoritative, knowledgeable, experienced, and comprehensible to the reasonably well-educated layman. For the statistically sophisticated, he offers new insights into the perils of forecasting.<br />  Yes, he is a dedicated political progressive, a liberal's liberal. But he scarcely mentions it except in passing, and it never gets in the way of his math or his narratives. I'm as politically conservative as he is, and I hated him for his uncannily accurate 2012 election forecasts. But he certainly was right! And his book is an outstanding piece of work. He'd be welcome at my side anytime in a poker game.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love the first book and I have a feeling it will remain as the best one in my opinion. This book however  was also great and met my expectations. I am sad that there is only one more that lies ahead...I still think that this trilogy would make great movies!!

0316212377|3.0|Look at my user name. I love the Culture and Bank's would have to be seriously off his game for me not to relish this, the latest in the series. Yet there is something not quite right. The story itself is cut from the mould - a civilisation, nearly as old and powerful as the Culture, is about to Sublime, (move out of the Real into a realm that is part of physics but sounds suspiciously heaven for civilizations, a mass rapture).<br />An act of violence prevents some one telling something that might effect the Subliming.  What follow is a hunt by the Culture  to find out what that something was , to track it down and decide what to do about it. The ships are aided by an  adventurous musician of a near unplayable instrument, who may hold the key.<br />  I suspect for the uninitiated, of the easily confused, the reader who wants a straight forward, stand alone. good read this book may be better than Bank's earlier Culture novels.<br />All the elements are there.<br />It still has the awesome, ironic, arrogant, amusingly Minds - artificially intelligence's who are the Cultures real rulers. They are better developed here, as seperate personalities, than in the past. An eccentric suitcase- like drone is present and correct. There is no lack of drug bowls and casual alteration of bodies and exotic orbitals.  But this could almost be very high quality fan literature.<br /><br />One of the glories of Banks is his huge, vivid imagination. He invents scenarios, from a world of living balloons the size of small moons to computer generated hells, that would maker the sole foundation for a series of fat trilogies for many a lesser author.  Yet he uses them lightly, and moves on.<br /><br />They too are still there, but he moves on not just nimbly but with haste.  Over edited ? I doubt it at his stage in the game. This is a very linear narrative, whereas Banks usually has elements out of sequence, or apparently irrelevant to the main narrative that click into place as the story continues, or remain hanging to one side, offering a different lens.<br /><br />He seems to have developed a love of paragraph long sentences - not that Banks was ever Hemingway in the first place, never noted for brevity and terse descriptions - which seem to be littered with sub clauses -  identified by dashes rather than commas or parenthesis  - but while this doesn't really matter too much , as he is always lucid - it is a little odd.<br /><br />The story seems to be over before it begins. More mysterious still, is the lack of mystery, even when we seem to be set up for revelation. SPOLIERS Perhaps he is planting deliberate red herrings to tease readers familiar with the Culture books.. If so,<br />he tricked me a treat.  The Caconym - it is obvious it's real name will turn out to be ? Flick through earlier books if you like - but you won't discover it in this one.  That weird musical instrument, or the scarf like \\"familar\\" will surely turn to be a Culture artifact  that suddenly .... Only they don't. The delusion of the rather annoying android who thinks he is in a stimulation will be critical because ...Only it isn't. Nothing wrong with jokes at the expense of my expectation. I suppose he could be showing he is not repeating the same story time after time.<br /><br />More disturbing than the brevity and red herrings is the nihilism. It could be interesting but isn't. Bank, despite his firm anti war stance in real life , has seemed  to view the Culture's liberal interventionism with some indulgence, although the moral ambiguity is underlined again and again. It is at the core of the tension at the heart of the Culture. Here some Minds are lazy and complacent, others decide to do nothing after all their violent efforts. The chief villain, often torn apart by knife missiles at a story's end, simply gets away with it. None of this is wrong. In fact it is a great positive if a writers view evolves, or view of his creation evolves,and it makes perfect sense Minds wouldn't always do the same thing over and over again through a history of Millennia. It is good if an author  takes a different moral stance from his  usual. But this feels a stunted evolution, casual, not fully realized. I'm left asking if he's doing what comes naturally, quickly and efficiently, but without fully engaging. My most optimistic take would be that it is a rather long prologue to a longer book where all the characters reappear. Only I don't believe that.<br /><br />So ratings. I'm giving it a three - even though i have given higher ratings to books i have enjoyed much less. One of my complaints is that oldest cliche \\"I didn't want it to end\\". How do ratings work - do you give all Shakespeare's plays a five when some deserve a trillion and others only three million ? Not that I am comparing Banks, to Shakespeare but he has got close to perfection in his field. So its a Banks 3 star. Which means it is a must read, but if it is your first, greater glories await. If you're Banks, try harder.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have just started to pick up a book and read again, after hearing all the girls where I work talk about this book I had to read it for myself. I feel a bit more educated on a few things about sex, not being personally into that circle of life. It was capitulating to say the least I found it hard to stop reading because I was not personally knowable in this lifestyle. I did talk to my friends they even had a get together to talk about it. I could not make the event, but I found out some of them had not been able to finish the book because it was too much for them. I hear that a move maybe in store for us in the feature.  I am looking forward to what they may keep from the books and put on film.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Don't spend more than a dollar on this movie and watch it with friends with plenty of alcohol just to make it all the more economical and entertaining, but it is certainly entertaining. You kinda get the sense fairly quickly that the filmmakers fully understood that it was a terrible flick and still plowed ahead with a wink and a grin, inviting laughs at some pretty ridiculous plot points (like jumping from horse to horse during a stampede that just happens to be teetering at the edge of a cliff). Couldn't really tell if they were trying too hard to make it what they might have thought was awesome or if they didn't really give a damn how silly it was, but that ambiguity really adds to the entertainment value. Really could have done without some pretty gratuitous religious themes, but unfortunately that happens sometimes. But if you're bored and need to watch something stupid when under the influence, look no further.

Even though some of the ideals of the series is 'not my cup of tea', it was a love story, such as the Twilight Series.  The author has quite a vivid imagination and engineers her way leading you page by page through her fantasies leaving you wanting the perfect ending.  I must say she has a not so nice way to end her books, but it certainly gets the reader to reach for the next book.  Overall, the series a very good read.
0789204096|1.0|The dimensions were eliminated from the description. Now I know why, it is 4&#34; by 4.5&#34;. I know it says Tiny Folio, but that's too tiny<br />If I knew that, I would not order it. Lesson learned
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am an big fan of Mr.Demille, have read all of his books, with Kate & John Cory,  from night fall, the lion, and now the Panther, this novel is definitely not one of his best works. This was overly narrated in the third person by John Cory, and if failed to keep me riveted like I expected. The ending did not leave me wanting more,
B008XG1X18|5.0|so it took me a while to check out pinterest but now i am hooked!! this app makes it super easy to add new pins, check out ur friends stuff, and just browse random pins.
B008B4KVS8|5.0|Ice Station Zebra is a great Cold War drama. When a spy satellite crashes in the Arctic, the race is on between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to recover it! Not a lot of action but beautifully filmed, tons of suspense and some terse acting by Patrick McGooghan, Rock Hudson and Jim Brown.
B007V65R54|5.0|The Signal and the Noise will change the way you think about and look at the world.  A well-written and engaging book.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love arrows, and bows, and a good looking man!!!<br />The show made me interested in knowing more about the characters,<br />and I'm amazed at the craftmanship of the bow and arrow. I'm glad I got the series.<br />The only problem is that sometimes the downloading/streaming<br />is very slow and it ruins the whole viewing.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Chattem is smoking HOT. So worth it watching him. But also the other cast made it fun notwithstanding the corny predictable stupid trite plot.  My Amazon live stream screwed up towards the end of the middle of the end of the movie and I wasn't even sorry. Because I think the stripping parts were over!
0316228532|1.0|Ms. Rowlings in her first attempt to write an adult novel has felt that the copious use of four-letter words will make this book appeal to the mature audience. She is mistaken. I found it abhorent!
B0058SNLO6|5.0|Love this Crocs, several of my firends ordered this style after they tried on my shoes and they felt so comfortable, it also looks good .
B0092C2X7U|5.0|I really liked the challenges and completing a level. great app I love it awesome great cool jgf gfcv gcvg
B009YU62H2|4.0|Being away 16 years, then coming back and releasing something that would have fit beside their epochal albums is quite an immpressive feat. If there's one thing I think they did right it is this: they took their time. They regrouped, toured, got comfortable playing together again, and recorded this. Chris Cornell has not done anything this good since the last Soundgarden album. It's very impressive that their sound here is STILL one of a full band, melding their talents together into an enjoyable listening experience from start to finish. One thing to emphasize with King Animal is to listen to it from the beginning to end. In my opinion, it plays best that way.<br /><br />King Animal may not enjoy the same kind of commercial success the latest from Alice in Chains did, as far as hit rock songs go, but they've nevertheless applied a similar, winning formula. By releasing a new album that successfully captures their signature sound while still feeling contemporary.<br /><br />I love it. It is better than Down on the Upside, but a notch or two below Superunknown and Badmotorfinger. No matter, still great.
B0045TYDNC|1.0|I purchased this as a replacement cap.  I put it on the lens twisted and NOW IT WILL NOT COME OFF OF A VERY EXPENSIVE LENS.  THE LENS IS A NIKON  AND THIS CAP WAS ADVERTISED TO FIT.  NOW I NEED TO FIND OUT HOW I CAN GET IT REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGING MY LENS.  DO NOT PURCHASE.  I USUALLY DO NOT WRITE BAD REVIEWS AND ALWAYS TAKE OTHER REVIEWS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT - BUT THIS EXPERIENCE IS HORRENDOUS!

B009LL4LMM|1.0|Zero Stars ... This app has an appeal for its lively graphics and the physics thing, but asks permissions that should be unnecessary. Invasive permissions give up information to the developers. I will not load games that will make my device a spy for some greedy developer. Zero stars would be my first choice!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is all it was hyped to be and more.  Even in a breather episode, the quality and edge of your seat drama is far greater than anything else on tv.  Every time you think you have this show figured out, someone of great relevance dies.  The suspense never ends and you find yourself rooting for humanity while questioning whether you would or could keep humanity alive in an environment like Walking Dead.  This season raises even more questions than season 2 without all the inner naval gazing.  Walking Dead Season 3 is absolutely the BEST use of television today.  Period.....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has done it again.  He has made me read a book and not want to stop until I finish it.  He kept me guessing until the end.  The main character is flawed, yet fascinating.  I wasn't sure exactly who the real bad buys were.  Grisham frustrates me because now I have to wait another year or so for the next book!
0399226907|1.0|This is not the full size book that you see in the stores.  More like 4 x 6.  Huge disappointment!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This was a good read. It was left on a cliff hanger I'm now buying the 3rd book in the series.<br /><br />Can't wait to read it.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I thought I would give this book a try as there is so much hype about it, my mother bought the first book for me.  At first I was horrified at the way he was treating her, there is no way I would let anyone be my master.  But after getting into the book I did enjoy it, so much so I bought the 2nd edition, 50 shades grayer.  It is an erotic romance novel, better than Mills and Boon though and I did find myself feeling aroused in some parts.  I normally read crime novels but I liked reading this for a change of pace and I am getting ready to read the 3rd book, Fifty shades free.  It is a continuing story so you do need to read the next books if you want to find out how the story pans out. All in all, not a bad book, could't understand why some people gave such a bad review but if you like romance I would recommend this book to perk it up a bit.
B00785P2QC|5.0|i love this game so much!!!! totally addicted. play it over and over and over again!!! love it love it love it!
B000YDCFRE|5.0|Overall great looking boot, light-weight and comfortable. Reminds me of my old USMC Danner's.<br />SIZING: This is a thin skin boot(no gore-tex, insulation, etc). It's design is for the wearer to utilize the proper thickness of sock for the climate, so they run about a size larger to allow for thick winter socks. I don't plan on taking them to the arctic, so I ordered a size smaller. I'm a US size 10.25, being as my foot is right between 10.69\\"(size 10) and 10.81\\"(size 10.5). I ordered a size US 9.5M and without socks there is approximately 2/3\\" from tip of big toe to end of inside of boot, but this is barefooted, so with a decent pair of boot socks they fit perfectly. Best advice is to measure your foot and convert it to a US size, then subtract 1 size and go with that. If your foot falls in between two sizes like mine, use your best judgement.<br /><br /> Here is a copy/ paste link >>><br /><br />[...]
B000063UR2|5.0|I used to watch this when I was a kid, so I ordered it so I could watch it with my kid. He loves it, I love it and I'm sure you will too.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  It was full of suspense, twists and turns.  Liam Neeson is always good.  I plan to watch the sequel.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I had the DVD's.  I upgraded to the Blu-Ray in order to get the max out of my surround sound and TV.  I really love these movies.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan, so I've been looking forward to the release of the Casual Vacancy for quite some time to see if Jo's writing continued to be captivating outside of the magical world. I have to say I was not disappointed in the slightest. It's definitely not anything like the Potter books, but she maintains her talented writing style of having twists and turns and creates wonderfully realistic characters that you can relate to. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who's expecting her to continue in the style of Potter, but for fans who truly love her writing, this book is a gem.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford and Sons have done it again. A pure mixture of spiritual and indie folk mystery. Markus Dravs aligns himself with a spiritual view that is astounding.
B009KYXEY6|1.0|The cd is supposed to come with 3 bonus tracks on Born to Die, but for some odd reason MANY MANY copies are missing these tracks!!! tracks 13-15 are missing!!! Beware until interscope fixes this issue!<br /><br />I GIVE 1 STAR DUE TO FALSE ADVERTISING ON INTERSCOPES PART!

B009HV2JT8|4.0|i might be bias since i like everything vampire, but this movie had action and some historical truth to it. it was a good movie. i watched it with my kids, 6 and 13 year old.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Although this movies was watchable, it was not more than that.  You would have to be a very desperate housewife to be turned on by this movie.  It was very lacking after all the build up the media gave it.  The story was weak, and the supporting actors didn't know how to act, they were emotionless robots just reading their lines.  I was highly disappointed.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is the usual Grisham novel:  well written, difficult to put down.  Not one of his best but still enjoyable
B008BM9L72|4.0|I think it needed a little more of the story behind Fifty Shades.<br />Otherwise a good read.<br />I would recommend to friends.
B004I744AS|4.0|The free dictionary by farlex presents information directly, peripherally and anecdotal with interesting details about words requested for definition and background, at least for those obscure one I have sought. In a word, the response from this source is \\"exhaustive\\" and easily exceeds the competition

B009KHDT0C|5.0|The movie was very entertaining and as always Johnny Depp delivered an outstanding performance. I would watch again and again!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After finishing all three books, I can honestly say that this book was by far the best of all three. It was the only one I did not want to put down. It was written better than the other two and had better plot development. The story became about more than just BDSM.<br />The trilogy isn't one I would recommend for most people, the topic itself is taboo and the books are almost fantasy when it comes to how a real D/s relationship works (I know from personal experience). The author is almost afraid to turn the stories into real erotica, never using terms that are actually heard in the bedroom. However, for those that do choose to read them I recommend holding out and finishing the trilogy.<br />There is one scene at the end of this book I find rather disturbing. Personally I cannot endorse flogging a pregnant woman on her belly. As a medical professional I believe this has the potential to cause harm to the unborn child.
B009FB3XTA|3.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers that this soundtrack is rather weak compared to the others.  I was hoping for some Muse.  This seems to have a lot of ballads.  I am very disappointed, as I really enjoyed all the other soundtracks and really looked forward to this one's release for awhile.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the cat is a wonderful character.  Preschoolers love to read this story over and over.  I will need to order another copy soon, the kids have read this one to the point of almost falling apart.  They love it!

B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I watched with my mom and son so there were 3 generations who thoroughly enjoyed this movie, we had a great time, it was funny and entertaining.
0345803485|2.0|I do not think I will finish this book, its so \\"out there\\" and feels  like it was written by teens with over active imaginations.  The two main characters, Anna and Christian are not believable and to me, annoying. Chris is on some kind of sadist ego trip and Anna comes across as a very immature and awkward girl.  I was on a long waiting list for this book and I am very disappointed, Im glad I got it at the  library and didnt buy it. This is just my opinion, you might like it, but I was very excited to read it and that excitement crashed very early on in the book.

0670026182|1.0|I purchased this book based on the glowing reviews, and after looking at it myself could not disagree more with those reviews.  The photos are \\"arty\\" to the point of being out of focus. The text is printed in old fashion typewriter font and is quite small.  It's also superimposed over \\"arty\\" colored backgrounds making it difficult to read.  I cannot comment on the recipes themselves as I couldn't get beyond the format of the book.  I knew I'd never use it, and it's going back, the ONLY book I've ever returned to amazon (and I've bought 100's if not 1000's).
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A wonderful story of an every day kind of guy that had messed up early in his life but finally turned things around and achieved incredible things. His military service record and the manner in which he cared for all of his relationships make him a true American hero and an unforgettable person.

B009A9EPLM|5.0|America has long had a love affair with Abraham Lincoln, arguably our greatest President. He has been well-served in both movies and music. Over the years there have been countless musical tributes, compositions, documentaries, etc., written on behalf of this inspiring man. The recent Steven Spielberg movie \\"Lincoln\\", receiving rave reviews, contains a beautiful soundtrack written by John Williams and played by the great Chicago Symphony orchestra. The opening track \\"The Peoples House\\" contains a beautiful & poignant melody that speaks Lincoln in every bar. Each of the 17 tracks transports the listener back in time. At times John Williams reminds us of the wonderful music that Aaron Copland blessed us with, but it still unmistakably that of John Williams.<br />Contrasting the soundtrack's contemplative & tranquil moments, there are rousing tracks such as #3 and #10 that will conjure up a smile to your face and a tap to your toes.  Track #7 features the wonderful Chicago Symphony chorus, singing the Battle Cry of Freedom, which will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. The beautiful \\"With Malice Toward None\\" is given both a lovely orchestral and piano solo rendition. After listening to this soundtrack repeatedly, I simply cannot wait to see the movie! Highest recommendation.<br /><br />While I'm at it, the TV documentaries, \\"The Civil War\\" and \\"Lincoln\\" both produced wonderful soundtracks, well worth owning. Also, from the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield Illinois is available a 2 CD album. This excellent musical tribute artfully uses period music from the Civil War era, which is played in the library and museum. Tunes, such as Dixie, Battle Cry of Freedom, When Johnny Comes Marching Home, Battle Hymn of the Republic, etc., prevail throughout the 91 minute journey. Track 7 of disc 2, named Gettysburg, has two choirs singing the Battle Hymn of the Republic and Dixie in tandem to great effect. Every American should own this recording and visit the library and museum for the inspiration they both provide. I have also reviewed this purchase and highly recommended it as well.and visit the library and museum for the inspiration they both provide.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I had never read a JK Rowling book (Harry Potter etc) before, nor seen a film so this was a leap of faith for me.  It took a while for me to figure out who all the characters were but I found them sympathetic, amusing, thought provoking and realistic.  I am a Brit so perhaps I found the characters and towns more familiar than Americans would.  The language is &#34;blunt&#34; and could be shocking to many, and the behavior, actions and attitudes of the teenagers in the book could also shock.  Some may think it reflects badly on English society but JK Rowling works hard to explain the real world and circumstances these young people find themselves in.  If you can get past the language and subject matter, the book is in parts hilarious and a real page turner.
0446580848|5.0|The Panther is another winner from Nelson DeMille. I have read every DeMille book and loved them all. (Well, truth is, I only 'liked' Spencerville.) But John Corey is my most favorite character.  I've been reading this book for the past week, and looked forward to any free time to just curl up and enjoy John Corey and the A-team's back and forth banter. At times, I wanted to say, \\"get on with the action\\".....but I savored every chapter. It even made me google Yemen, and the ruins, etc. Actually found images of the hotel room they stayed in in Adan! Isn't the internet great!  (I even found a blog from a girl who went there for 2 months in 2010. Wow, was she brave,,,,or crazy!)  I'm sorry to have the book end. I feel like I waited so long for this to come out, and now it's done! Nelson is one great writer. I want more.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|The author is a master storyteller when he is in good form, his stories multi-dimensional and his prose sparkles. In this book he is not in good form. The book begins nicely though and is entertaining and promising right up until Mr. Cooley appears, when everything suddenly goes flat and remains flat for the rest of the book. I am hugely disappointed.
B009NCM248|4.0|I think this is another great album from stone sour. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it can be a little soft which I don't like. However, the bring amazing riffs and the great vocals that they are known for.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I think this app is really cool! Also I think they should add lots of cool updates to Bakery story,  Restaurant story fashion story and all the other ones. I have all the story games by TeamLava and I love them!!!!

B009ERK1T0|5.0|Been a fan ever since Around The Fur came out constantly been hooked. I'm happy to say that through out the many moments of my life since then this band has always been there as a soundtrack. They have never strained from themselves and remained true to their style. This album is no different. Chinos vocal style is more melodic than aggressive than what used to, but that is by no means a bad thing here. Frank's presence is really strong on all the tracks, tons of layers to be found. So far my favorites have to be \\"Gauze\\", \\"Rosemary\\" then what goes into \\"Goon Squad\\". I haven't purchused a CD in awhile but when it comes to this band, its a must. You can't tell the dudes are pushing 40, they don't seem to be slowing down either.
B009E2WX3W|4.0|I was going to buy this disc because I had lost my previous copy and was looking forward to the improvements. It is still a great album, which has been made better but there is still plenty of noise on the disc so it not remastered to modern quality. If you don't have it is a great buy if you do have it well this isn't worth the upgrade.
B005PK553C|5.0|This was a great show, Amazon video worked great, very few glitches. For $20 not too bad of a price tag either!
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Amazing story and insightful look at China in transition from Imperial power to subjugated country.  The tale of the brutal murder of Pamela Werner, daughter of an eccentric sinologist and former British counsel couldn't have been written with any more suspense and intrigue if it had been total fiction.  The glimpse of the waning days of the old British foreign service and the odd mingling of expats, White Russian refugees, the local Peking underworld, petty and not so petty criminals is a gripping read from start to finish.  The Quixotic quest by her father to find justice, stymied by the disinterest of the British legation, set against the background of the Japanese invasion preceding WWII is skillfully interwoven with the recreation of the events leading up to and after the young girls murder.  Read it aloud every night to friends from my Kindle after we lost power for a week after Sandy blew through.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I really enjoyed how Scott introduced elements of science and faith in this production.  Initially, he was having the 2 sides clash, but in the end, science integrates into one's faith very seamlessly.  Science and faith are pursuing the goals of explaining ultimate reality, and when approached properly and patiently, will lead to the same goal!
B00913P6G0|4.0|I thought this was a solid effort and album by Compton Native Kendrick Lamar. The content of this album is more than just women and drugs. There is mention of police, family, disenfranchisement and how gang life affects everyone around you, not just those holding the guns. There's also a balance of the positives out there that you can create for yourself. There's so much going on here, and I'm glad that this album helps diversify the choices of rap currently out here. I'm also surprised a little by some of the collaborations on the album, but they all work. Some features are from Mary J. Blige, Jay Rock, Drake, Anna Wise, Dr. Dre (of course), MC Eiht. Simply put, a solid album.<br /><br />Favorite tracks (in no particular order)<br />Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe<br />The Recipe<br />Poetic Justice<br />Black Boy Vibe<br />The Beginning of The Art of Peer Pressure<br />Real<br />Swimming Pools (Drank)

B00A12Z264|4.0|Lotus Intro - I really like this intro for many reasons. The mellowness of the track is intoxication, and the length is very welcome.<br /><br />Army of Me - A song about being independent, rising up against the disenfranchisement one tried to push on you. She sings about being a fighter, and no longer taking ones crap anymore.<br /><br />Red Hot Kinda Love - This song is basically about the freshness and infatuation of love in the moment, even if you at first were not looking for it. About not being able to think about anything else but the person you are in love with, and wanting to spend all your time with them.<br /><br />Make the World Move ft Ceelo Green - Right out the gates of this song I knew this was going to be a song that I liked. This song is about moving forward in the world with positivity. Ceelo Green brings his funkiness to the track, and the collaboration is very crisp and just works. This could make a definite single, and would make a very interesting music video. Very funky and positive track that is too short.<br /><br />Your Body - First single off Lotus and at first I didn't care for it, but to be fair I did hear the entire track. This track just pulls you in. After listening in the entirety I grew to love. I will say that I have heard only the censored version of this song, and I think it works very well. I heard rumors of a graphic version but haven't seen that anywhere.<br /><br />Let There Be Love - Right away this type of beat or production seemed super familiar. It's definitely a Max Martin production, and is something I believe will do well on the dance billboard, clubs and overseas. However, the beat sounds like something I have already heard, but cannot put my finger on. Definite potential to be a single, but I wouldn't release it as single number two.<br /><br />Sing for Me - First ballad of the album. This is an uplifting, rising from the ashes kind of song. The beat reminds me of the type you would hear near the end of a late 80s-early 90s movie when the protagonist has learned the lesson of the movie, or when everything is in their favor. I know that is a random picture, but I was able to imagine a scenario right away and to me that is a good song.<br /><br />Blank Page - Sia Furler and Christina Aguilera have a very interesting dynamic when it comes to working together. This is also a ballad about regret and apology. This track is only Christina singing over a piano. Solid vocals all around.<br /><br />Cease Fire - I did not immediately fall in love with this track. I think it was the ennunciation that did not pull me into it. But there are definite parts that I liked about it. This track is about knowing when to draw your cards, for you do not have to exhaust your energy on every call. It's also about realizing that you are not alone and have allies by you. Basically, just chill out. It's an alright song.<br /><br />Around the World - This is a very loud track. A mix of a lot when it comes to the beat and production. A lot of drums, etc. I like it a lot.<br /><br />Circles - Right away the beat caught me. Then Ms. Aguilera's attitude on this song is tough! It's basically an \\"F You\\" to the haters. It's so catchy and something that will be on repeat.<br /><br />Best of Me - Another ballad type song. This song is basically about not sacrificing yourself to the detriment of someone else. Of not lowering yourself to the low level of someone else, and not playing their games anymore by tarnishing yourself. Positive message of not breaking yourself to someone you no longer recognize because of someone else.<br /><br />Just a Fool ft Blake Shelton - Very interesting collaboration, because I never really listened to a Blake Shelton song before. But neither artists overpowered one another, and this bluesy/country-lite song actually works. If released, I think it would do great in the country market.<br /><br />Light Up the Sky - Positive uplifting song. Love the song. You just have to listen to it in it's entirely to hear the message and feel the song.<br /><br />Empty Words - An inspiring and spiritually elevating song. A standout to me. It is a long the same lines as Circles, maybe even it's counterpart - same message, just without the bad or crass words.<br /><br />Shut Up - I do not know if the beeping was a purposeful aspect of the song, but it can go either way for some people. For me it was distracting and a bit annoying, especially when she does curse in the song. I wish we could get the full experience of the song. Otherwise it's an alright song.<br /><br />Your Body [Martin Garrix Remix] - A solid dance remix.<br /><br />There are some very interesting themes in this album, the standouts to me being positivity, love, redemption and confidence in oneself. This is a really great musical effort that I hope redeems Christina Aguilera with the fans that did not come out and support her last effort [[ASIN:B003G4DFRC BIONIC - DELUXE (Explicit)]], which I actually really liked. She has moved more towards the pop-ish side of the spectrum where as Bionic was very experimental with a lot of electronica and Euro-pop elements, but this album totally works for me as well. But I can always appreciate an artist who can sing as well as write, which she has credits on a majority of this album.n it's entirely to hear the message and feel the song.<br /><br />Empty Words - An inspiring and spiritually elevating song.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a fan of TV, in general, but this show is very entertaining. I think it is well written, shot and executed. The acting is also very good. While the zombie action is sometimes not the primary focus of an episode, you don't mind because of the great characters. The storyline is one that is not too far out there, and this helps pull you into the show. I recommend it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|What's not to love with this movie? It's a classic & mom & the nephews like watching it when they get together.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|The sound was amazing, I love the vocals, all of the songs were well written, just overall one of my favorite albums as a whole. They pulled off songs from three different genres (rock, alternative, and techno) perfectly, and the lyrics flow like a river. Simply amazing.
0143039504|5.0|I bought this for mom because it has all her novels in one convenient book, which saves time & money. She was buying one novel at a time until I told her about this book & she said it was a good deal..
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Sure, the first chapter drops you right into the middle of...what?  It takes awhile to get oriented, and then boom, you are stuck in the next of the 6 stories.  Huh?  But open your mind, and stop trying to have to know everything, just read and enjoy Mitchell's fine writing and intricate story telling.<br /><br />As you do, and his language is beautiful, his themes develop, and the cadence of the storytelling becomes a joy.<br /><br />I loved this novel, one of the very best I have read in awhile, one I found delightfully easy to read.  It was not, as some suggest, difficult to read, or finish, or a laborious project to complete.  I read it in a week with a busy schedule, because I couldn't wait to see how the stories competed and how Mitchell would finish weaving his tale(s).  Brilliant.<br /><br />But, yes there is a but, the movie, which tells a the \\"same\\" story with substantial plot differences, though it is emotionally and thematically the same story, is one of only two novels turned into a movie where I have to say that the movie is better than the novel itself.  More Wachowski magic.  I know, I know, it hurts to admit, but it is true.<br /><br />Note to self:  Need to read A Canticle for Leibowitz again.  Dr Schwartz would be so shocked, and very pleased with himself.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Mom & the kids love this movie & watch it every once in a while when they're not watching Pokemon & Beyblade..
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I will be the first person to say I am not so much a Katy Perry fan. However, I found this movie entertaining and insightful. I applaud her for baring it all for the camera and not putting on a front. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. I recommend it.
B001AQT11M|5.0|Me, mom, my sis & her kids love this movie & watch it any chance we get (when they're not watching pokemon or beyblade)!!
B00005KK9M|5.0|I've loved this release since it came out.  I had it on cassette, then downloaded the songs off of Limewire, and when that crashed, I just couldn't go without it.  Every song on here is just fantastic.  I ordered it with the free shipping option and got it ahead of schedule, so Thank You Amazon!  You have a life-long shopper from me!!  (Especially since there's no sales tax included - I buy as much as possible here!)
B00335EQ0E|5.0|I decided to buy this for the holidays as mom & the nephews loved the movie & wanted to share it together when they came to visit.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. It held my interest the whole time and went very fast. I have heard that Taken Two has been made an is out or to be realesed soon. I can't wait to see this movie. I am sure it is a sequal. I have heard that it is better than the first Taken. If it is better it will really be good. This movie is equalivent to a James Bond movie with all the fast action just not as much teck stuff. Don't miss this movie if you want to see a good movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great continuation of Gideon's story!! Can't wait for the next installment!!  Hoping that both he and Eva can resolve those painful pasts and move forward!!
B0030MM68O|3.0|I like it and it is the kind of movies that I like but it was way to long. The action was very slow and through out the movie the action did not change. The action remained slow and it was repeated through out the whole movie. I keep expecting the action and fighting to get intense but it never did. I heard so much about this movie and wanted to see it. After seeing it I was pretty disappointed in the film. Some of you might like this but I would not recommed this movie, it is not that great.
B0083SBJXS|2.0|The second screen does not interface as proclaimed.  I have BD live player with Ipad.  Maybe somebody at Disney can explain why it is not functioning properly
B008M34INW|4.0|It was thrilling, exciting, held your interest, was good but not great. It was two long which cause me to loose some interest. The movie could have been 1/2 hour shorter and been just as good if not better. It is an action movie and better than most that are around right now. I would recommend it but not give it my highest rating. It is worth seeing if you like action movies.
B000YDE46Y|4.0|Had to return the first set as the size runs 1 to 1.5 sizes too large. I usually wear an 11.5 but ended up with a 10.5 (although a 10 would probably have been better.) Estimate low.<br /><br />As for the boot, its great. Comfortable and nice enough to pass at work in the winter.
B009KYXEY6|1.0|I have been waiting months for this CD. Right now, it looks like I may be waiting a few more before Interscope fixes the missing tracks issue. Not happy.
0525953728|5.0|This was a great read. It was very written and will make you understand that day with even greater respect for our service people.

1619691825|5.0|Great story as Nelson DeMille's always are.  A book that you can't put down.  Is as current as the news.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille once again has a winner in The Panther.  His character, John Corey, blends humor with a great and exciting story.  DeMille is a master story-teller and never fails to give enjoyment to the reader.  An example of a writer starting off well and getting even better as time goes by.  This time Corey once again meets Islamic terrorism and this time on the terrorist's turf.  An enjoyable lesson in what we face today in this very dangerous world in which we find ourselves primarily after 9/11.
0307948110|2.0|Robert Harris gets points for his interest in exploring many different locations, time periods, and approaches to fiction in his usually accomplished and entertaining novels.  This one, set in the world of a high-tech hedge fund in contemporary Geneva, is a clunker -- with an unappealing protagonist, an overload of jargon-heavy description and dialogue, and a mystery that was no challenge to figure out.  I chugged along to the end only on the strength of Harris's previous books.  Dr. Alex Hoffman, the brilliant, ridiculously wealthy, and diffident -- no people skills -- computer genius who runs a successful, AI-driven hedge fund for the elite, is having a very bad day.  An intruder has breached the security system in his home and viciously attacked him.  He seems to have opened an offshore account to which purchases can be traced that he recalls nothing about.  His erratic behavior as a result seems poised to alienate his business colleagues and his wife and catches the eye of the police inspector sent to investigate the break-in and attack.  A promising set-up, but it's scarcely worth sticking around for the ride.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Once again John Grisham has crafted a complex story that leads the reader down a path he least expects. What a greaT author. I lead a group of authors trying to do only half as well as this guy and we don't come anywhere near his talent.  Guaranteed to keep the reader up all night wondering what will happen next. He absolutely proves what I always knew. The FBI does not know everything about everyone. . . and a smart crook can beat em every time.  There are several retired special agents in my Lions club and I will strongly reoommend they check this one out for educational purposes. They can definitely pick up a few pointers. I only wish I had half the talent Mr. Grisham has, I would be happy to turn all my 26 years of worldwide  military adventures into saleable novels.All I can sayu is BUY IT..READ IT.. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|The premise is quite good and being a long time science fiction fan definitely gave me the right frame of reference to gain maximum amusement from the story.  Not too long but still worth the read.  However, I would recommend Old Man's War (Scalzi's) if your looking for some Sci-fi with a more serious read.
B009LL4LMM|3.0|I think it is a bit overpriced for three bucks, especially with so much variety available at a third of that price. You can easily find much more entertainment with three one dollar games than with this one.<br /><br />That said, this is a mind-thinking, puzzle solving game. It is a lot like Angry Birds in that you are trying to use the most basic laws of physics (and rubber bands and teleporters) to get your jellyfish to fly over to a feather while collecting gadgets along the way. You draw, move, and expand lines to get your jellyfish to catch air and move him/her in different direction. Getting the feather beats the level, getting the little gadgets gets you points. You decide which is more important.<br /><br />I found after playing for about an hour that it wasn't too much fun, but others might think otherwise. Check out the video and see if it is something you would like to play with. But I stand by my original statement, at three bucks it is WAY overpriced!
B008MM9630|4.0|love it. good escape from the world. everyone should try this at least once great fun, know need to have a bad day just play this game and the frunds upside down.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a huge Grisham fan and have read every one of his books.  This latest effort has some interesting characters, you could see Danzel Washington playing the lead in the movie version.  But the plot is not very believable, the set up for the climax in the plot was a version of the Firm's.  As always, the book is very readable, a page turner, but at the end, it is not his best effort.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Sorry I missed this in theaters. The 3D was excellent, the price well worth it.  Preordered it, it arrived promptly on release date.  If you are a fan of the Alien series, you'll love this film! If you are an extras fanatic, there is no way you'd be disappointed with this product.  Buy it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another winner for Rick Riordan and his Heroes of Olympus series! I could not put it down...and I wait anxiously for the next one!<br /><br />What did I like? I love how Mr. Riordan weaves in the old with the new...and makes it believable! The characters are relatable...despite being demi-gods. They have demi-god issues, but still deal with \\"normal\\" issues, too. The adventures are always descriptive and exciting -- non-stop fun!<br /><br />I can't do anything but recommend this book and this series. Fantastic!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Better than I remembered it in theaters.  Gorgeous color, the 3D popped, all the elements of the film looked organic and complimented each other, the military units, looked plausible, the whole thing just works!  Glad I waited for the 3D version.  Preordered it, it arrived promptly on release date. Very satisfied particularly at this price point.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Finally the bad piggies get their revenge, i think its even better than angry birds, Im hooked! I like the fact that you dont have too complete all three stars at once, keeps me interested.

B009IU6N5Y|5.0|It is hard to describe how much I love this film.  It was funny and kind of touching at times. Lincoln never seemed so cool. The way history was interwoven with fiction was really impressive and visually it was extremely engaging.<br />I rented it once, but knew immediately it was worth buying.<br />If I knew how much I would love it I would have bought it straight out.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This app is awesome!  I always hoped they would make this app.  Now all they need to do is create one for Indiana Jones.  5 stars!
B005LAII08|4.0|I love Disney and Pixar films, most of the time they have a more compelling story line than Hollywood blockbusters and you can watch them with your kids. Brave is pretty unique and it's one of my favorite Pixar films for it. It's lead female character isnt weak! It's not a poor defenseless princess who needs saved here leave that Super Mario Bros style story in the past. Merida is a strong young women who isn't embarrassingly helpless and has problems a normal teenager might have. Yes it's set in medieval Scotland but young kids can probably relate to theme's here. She makes a decision she thinks is helpful for her and deals with the consequences. I think it's great that any kid can watch this movie and say I want to be strong like Merida and have adventures too. All the usual Pixar humor is here and the movie is beautiful. The special features are great as well pretty cool to see the places in Scotland that inspired much of the landscapes in the film. Buy this movie because you'll watch it more than once!
B005PK553C|5.0|This is such an amazing show besides the you won't be able to sleep cause its scary factor, it has great story lines !
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Classic movie. I loved it when I was young and now I get to share it with my daughter. Good clean family movie!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In this immensely entertaining indictment of the so-called \\"criminal justice system\\", John Grisham has done it again!  He has exposed the bullying tactics of so much of law enforcement and the hypocrisy of those charged with the prosecution of crime, and he has done in a compelling, page-turning, can't-put-it-down story. Classic Grisham!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game can become very addicting. You got to use your brain on this one for sure. It will really make you think.
B009KYXEY6|1.0|PLEASE note that there are 15 tracks listed on Disc 1 both on Amazon, Lana's official site, iTunes, etc... THERE ARE NOT 15 TRACKS ON THE CD. THERE ARE ONLY 12. I found this out the hard way. Even though there are CLEARLY 15 tracks listed officially, AND on the back of the CD, tracks 13-15 are missing. I tried calling Interscope about the problem, but they insisted it wasn't their problem, and to just \\"try to get a refund.\\" Fortunately, Amazon is letting me have a refund, but DO NOT BUY THIS thinking that you're getting all 15 tracks of Born to Die. You're not. It's a rip off and a bait and switch that Interscope refuses to address or even bother to correct. It affects EVERY version of this, no matter where you bought it.
B005W0ARFQ|3.0|I have read and enjoyed earlier books in this series.The stories were gripping crime fiction and also presented a view of a grim period of 20th century history. I was disappointed with this book because it was too predictable; I could work out what was going to happen long before it happened. The opening in Berlin was quite gripping, the initial description of the personnel in the Lower Castle near Prague also was promising but the portrayal of Prague was very limited and things deteriorated after that.
0977476073|5.0|I have been looking for this book for many years and this one is a great read so far. I like this is the best copy to read because it is the true translation.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Although the box was a little small, the overall product was spot on with the Minecraft theme.  My kids love it.

0525953590|5.0|Many of us remember where we were during key world events; particle physicists would likely remember where they were on July 4, 2012. That was the day the Higgs boson was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva. By any measure it was one of the most momentous discoveries in physics, perhaps in all of science. But what exactly is the Higgs boson? Why is it important? And how was it discovered? In this engaging and informative book Caltech physicist Sean Carroll sheds light on all these aspects of the Higgs discovery.<br /><br />Carroll's book can be roughly divided into three parts. In the first part, after giving us a brief overview of particle physics describing relativity, quantum mechanics, the Standard Model and the discovery of the twelve elementary particles that make up the universe, Carroll plunges into a description of the giant particle accelerators that have made possible our understanding of nature's fundamental building blocks. Personally I found this part most enjoyable, since it's a little more accessible than the theoretical part. Carroll tells us about the stupendous engineering challenges involved in the building of the LHC and takes us on a nice little tour of its interior. There's all kinds of fascinating and amusing stuff here; the lead tungstate crystals in the detectors that took ten years to grow, the earlier particle accelerator whose workings were affected by the moon's tides, the baguette dropped by a bird that temporarily created electrical problems, the helium \\"explosion\\" caused by high voltage that crippled the machine for months, the physicist whose face was exposed to an intense beam of protons and who still escaped relatively unscathed. The sheer size and complexity of the ten-thousand pound detectors - ATLAS and CMS - beggar belief and the smooth functioning of these hunks of metal, plastic and electronics is a resounding tribute to human ingenuity and collaboration. Carroll is very good at describing the structure and function of the marvelous machines that made the Higgs possible and again confirms the fact that the best science involves both great intellectual ideas and world-class engineering. Many of the LHC's components as well as the principal players are illustrated in color photographs in the center of the book.<br /><br />Carroll also gives us a lucid account of the statistical methods and data collection techniques used to confirm the discovery of particles. The sheer amount of data collected by the LHC is staggering; as Carroll puts it, enough to fill about a thousand terabyte hard-drives per second. He does a good job detailing the great difficulty of collecting the data from an incredibly complex dance of particle collisions and most importantly, of separating the signal from the noise. He tells us about the almost mythical \\"5-sigma\\" threshold, essentially a very stringent statistical test that allows you to claim a \\"discovery\\" of a new particle. In July 2012, data from both the ATLAS and CMS detectors was combined together to claim a 5-sigma threshold. Carroll who was in the audience when the discovery was announced captures well the excitement in Geneva and around the world as an intensely international collaboration of more than three thousand LHC-related scientists tuned in to hear the groundbreaking news. This was definitely the discovery of a lifetime, and Peter Higgs was in the audience to hear about it. Yet Carroll drives home the point that statistics is not everything, and illustrates this through the cautionary tale of the discovery of \\"faster-than-light\\" neutrinos which, although statistically significant, turned out to be incorrect.<br /><br />The second part of the book gives us the theoretical basis of the Higgs boson. To Carroll's credit, he spends a fair amount of time dispelling the simplistic belief that the \\"Higgs boson gives everything mass\\" and does a pretty good job leading us through the subtleties of what's called the \\"Higgs field\\" and exactly how it's relevant to particles masses and interactions. He also addresses the common misunderstanding that most of the mass of an everyday object comes from the Higgs. It doesn't; it comes from the strong interactions and therefore won't suddenly disappear if the Higgs boson were to hypothetically vanish. Along the way Carroll explains important concepts like spontaneous symmetry breaking and Feynman diagrams which are integral to understanding the Higgs mechanism. The last part of the book also has interesting discussions on the potential implications of the Higgs for understanding dark matter, dark energy and the Big Bang. And an amusing chapter lays to rest the slightly paranoid \\"end-of-world\\" scenarios postulated before the LHC went online. This same chapter also takes a thoughtful look at the public promotion of science and addresses the role of blogs and other media which communicate science, often correctly but sometimes prematurely. Carroll makes us appreciate the fact that scientists have to tread a fine line in being accurate while still not giving the media an opportunity to sensationalize their findings.<br /><br />Finally in the third part, Carroll sheds light on the human aspect of science. Part of this is in the earlier chapters where he details the political jockeying and the clash of personalities that was involved in the cancellation of the high-stakes Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) project during the 90s. The fact is that these days even the most fundamental curiosity-driven research can involve billion-dollar equipment like the LHC. Carroll wonders whether governments around the world will now support these increasingly expensive endeavors, especially during times of recession, but also underscores the importance of this research for human creativity and unexpected practical spinoffs (like the World Wide Web). The human aspect of science is also revealed in a separate chapter that among other things asks who would get the Nobel Prize for the discovery. There is no doubt that somebody should get it (and almost universal consensus that Higgs should be included), but the history that Carroll describes makes it clear that at least six people came up with various parts of the idea within a narrow time frame. And the experimentalists seem to deserve it as much as the theoreticians. One thing is certain; any Nobel Prize for the Higgs is going to be at least somewhat controversial.<br /><br />In general I greatly enjoyed reading \\"The Particle at the End of the Universe\\". It's engaging and an easy read and would complement similar other volumes like Ian Sample's \\"Massive\\" (which focuses more on the human side) and Frank Close's \\"The Infinity Puzzle\\" (which is heavier on the science). Carroll is a pleasant, informative, patient and humorous guide on our tour of the LHC and the Higgs. He is also measured and tends to temper the enthusiasm of discovery with realism; for instance he makes it clear that the discovery of the Higgs still leaves many questions unanswered, and it has no impact on other outstanding scientific problems like discovering cancer drugs or understanding the economy. What Carroll does manage to communicate is the deep satisfaction of discovery, the thrill of the chase and the astonishing achievements that human imagination and skill can make possible.ctly how it's relevant to particles masses and interactions. He also addresses the common misunderstanding that most of the mass of an everyday object comes from the Higgs. It doesn't; it comes from the strong interactions and therefore won't suddenly disappear if the Higgs boson were to hypothetically vanish.

0439813786|5.0|I chose the book because I saw it in a school library and the artwork was fabulous. It almost told the story without words. I also chose it because I love magic and anything connected to it.<br /><br />Reading is crucial for learning. If a child struggles with reading they may never learn to enjoy it. This book and it's artwork is very enticing to read and could lure struggling readers to want to make the extra effort to do it.<br /><br />It was one of my favorites.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|this is probably their most dynamic album. it's very spacey, & colorful. themes of love, anger, time trival, & doomsday. really cool vibes all through the album. lots of nice intros & outros add depth, & alot of cool tempo shifts. Chino sounds great, & his guitar playing adds a nice layer along with Stef's mean sounding 8 string attack. 2 different styles of guitar playing working really well together. every track is awesome here. album of the year!

B005XN31LY|5.0|Being a \\"Happily Ever After\\" kind of girl, I love Once Upon A Time. They weave the fairy tales with modern day so brilliantly. It's really different from anything else that's on right now. The writing and the acting are so well done, that you will find yourself laughing one minute,  and a bit later your eyes will be welling up with tears. If you are a fan of fairy tales, and can appreciate good writing, you'll love Once Upon A Time.
B007ZKY7XO|4.0|This is another fabulous album, with Kiki and Only The Horses being the best two tracks. But I still have to say that the Night Work album is still my favorite. Love It!!!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Well I got my chance to listen to this and for the first time since Revenge, and I know everyone has said its kind of like Revenge, but its not, its harder, from the first to the last. From Hell or Hallelujah to Last Chance, this is the one Kiss Army fans have been waiting for (it seems) decades for a power packed CD from these guys, now if they can keep the momentum going.  Best All For The Love of Rock and Roll, Hell or Hallelujah.  This CD is not trying to be the original Kiss this CD is the new Kiss, for example look at how man songs were written with Tommy Thayer. Perfecto
B009VB97EY|5.0|Love! Love! Love!! If you are looking for the perfect girls night out movie, this is it!! You will want to watch it over and over for the eye candy! :)
1574214276|5.0|If you do buy any Zentangle books, buy this one.  It includes 104 Zentangles step by step.  I use it everyday.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Since I brought two knifes so far from Smith & Wesson, why not be ready in case knife needs sharper. I love its size. So perfect! Good to carry anywhere.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it!!! Can not put this book down!!! I'm such a fan of this trilogy, I recommend it to all the ladies a must read:-)
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Good book but guessed what was going to happen and still want to read the third one. Didn't grab me like the first one did.
B000002KIK|5.0|What can you say... Old Skool Black Sabbath.  Great collection of Songs.  Robert Downey Jr wore the shirt in the entire Avengers movie.
B004R1Q296|5.0|This enormous work of research is set as a novel. If you have any interest in the Middle Ages, Tuchman's masterful book is essential reading. Some years ago, daunted by its length, I read a few random sections.  I was captivated, particularly with accounts of the plague, everyday life of people from all levels of society, and battle preparation, execution and aftermath, all assiduously researched. Years later, I am reading the book for real and chose the Kindle edition, as the sheer weight of the paper book is enough to put a person off. And this time, I started from the beginning and am taking my time.  It's enormously rewarding.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best Grisham book. Loved it. Denzel Washington should play the led role! While reading it all I could hear was Denzel's voice!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter (5 years old) loved this movie. We originally rented it for the 48 hour period, but it became clear that was not going to be good enough! We now own it and have watched it nearly every day. I might be getting sick of it, but my daughter is still going strong.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|If you love Queen you'll love this. It's great quality. But I really enjoyed the commentary version with Brian May and Roger Taylor watching the concert and just comenting on it throughout the whole show. And gotta love disc 2 with the legendary Live Aid performance.
B00785P2QC|3.0|only for 10 min. things cost more money then you can make in game and you would have to spend real money to play.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Grampy and granddaughter love this game! My eight year old granddaughter is an ace at this game. Grampy believes it's difficult for him!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Thought provoking read, but at times very hard to follow.medical terms can be a bit overwhelming, but worth the time. Goes well with other near death experiences I have read, adds to the wealth of knowledge that there is more to life than here in earth. Would recommend.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I had been waiting forever to finally watch this movie and it did not disappoint.  LOVED IT!!  Bringing in all the Marvel characters from the other movies was wonderful.  They all played so well off of each other.  Loved the new characters too.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son and his girlfriend who are away at college.  Both are 20 and are enjoying the new season.  My son's girlfriend did not see the first season, hence the reason for the purchase.  She is NOW HOOKED, like the rest of us who have viewing this drama from day one!  Very unpredictable show; hence the writers are PHENOMINAL...CAST so well chosen and Mike Kelley; gifted and talented beyond words!  It is my \\"Dynasty\\" of yester-year....enjoying it tremendously!!  I would have to give the first season a huge 5 STARS*****HOWEVER, I believe the best is yet to come...  ******6 stars???
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Tom Cruise was excellent in it, and he was the most enjoyable part of it all. Other than that, I couldn't believe what I was watching and that someone actually green lit this film. Horrible!  I would definitely not recommend, even if it's free.
B0086700CM|5.0|My 10 year old loves this game.  It seems fun, not violent which is great for the age group.  Recommended for hours of fun!

B0041KVW2K|4.0|Haven't listened to the albums yet, need a new preamp.<br /><br />Definitely a *Wow* when you open the box. Elegant product packaging. (At least as elegant as cardboard gets.) Book's cool, excellent pics, and the paper shavings on the pages are proof of authenticity, I guess.<br /><br />Packing for shipping sucks! I had bagged air on the top side, no protection on the bottom, and the bagged air on the sides was popped. The box set itself sustained a minor ding or two, nothing serious. The box is in a sleeve which might have saved a couple of scuffs. You think for the $ there would be corner inserts in the box.
0345529057|5.0|5 Stars. Love the tv series but the books are amazing! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves reading.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is truly a beautiful movie.  A quirky town and even stranger family, but a touching plot.  The boy and girl, definitely misfits, find their way through it all to a mutual happiness.  (sorry if that's a spoiler, but the trip is more than worth it).
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I rented this movie for a date night and it was a perfect ending to the night. I would recommend others who are interested in the mission impossible brand to check it out.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A spell binding sequel to the equally enthralling \\"A Game of Thrones\\", this saga takes us through the war lords preparation to battle for the title of \\"King of the Seven Kingdoms\\". Written in a style that takes the reader on a journey through the individual lives of those key players who are impacted by the chaos that ensues, it is a page-turner that is very hard to put down. Well worth the read if you want to take a journey into fantasy in a world filled with danger, deceit, and treachery.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I rented this movie for a date night and it was a good beginning to the night. I would recommend others who are interested in dark fairy tales to check it out
0062127241|5.0|Pete Townshend's autobiography is forthright, honest, and intriguing literature. I feel as close to him, now, having read this<br />work, as if we were actually friends. Insight into his band, The Who, clarifies my opinion of this truly professional musician.<br />He also revealed, fearlessly, his bisexuality, blending this fact, quite skillfully, into the narrative. I have always admired<br />Pete's musicianship and his exquisite, passionate guitar lines, and this work adds much perspective into my opinion of him. He<br />is worthy of his fame and his wealth, and I'm glad to have read this book.  jamesbell750@yahoo.com
B008X9Z37A|3.0|My choice of this cover was completely price driven and I set out to find the cheapest I could.  So I didn't have high expectations.  The corners that hold the Kindle are very loose and keep slipping but it looks good and it's a sturdy cover and protects my device when I throw it into my backpack.  So, it's fine for what I wanted.  If you're not fussy about details, I'd recommend it.
0156027321|5.0|So much has been written about this book that I will not relate the plot.  Suffice it to say that it is an absolutely wonderful story about life, love, faith, and how we apprehend the universe.  I found the story extremely moving; it will stay with me for a long time.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|My husband absolutely loves this show and the crazy plot.  It always keeps you hooked and waiting for the next episode.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|An interesting introspective exploration of Scarpetta's realization that she is aging and all the fears that go with that. Her cases are also women who have aged and are powerful, making the theme of the book come alive.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|A very strange but clever story.  The reader must pay attention as characters reappear as the stories progress. But it does hold your attention most of the time.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|The first and greatest being the birth of the Christ child. I don't think I need to say anything more.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Like the game. Looks & sounds awesome on my Asus Transformer TF101. Played the free version 1st then bought HD version. The HD version has frozen up 4 times in one night! I don't know what is causing it. Have to pay for Jedi status, extra powers etc. Rovia def joined up with Lucas (ie: make more money). Three stars until they fix the bugs.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Being a child of the 80's I enjoyed the soundtrack.  Beyond that, I found the plot vaguely uninspiring, the musical aspects ranging from somewhat amusing to fairly irritating, and the Russel Brand love story completely superfluous. Tom Cruise as Stacey Jaxx was a throwback to his Bob Seger Lip-Sync days albeit slightly more moody, and Diego Boneta \\"writing\\" and \\"performing\\" Don't Stop Believin' was... well... completely unbelievable. :-P<br /><br />Props for some good crossover mixes and a good 80's vibe, but all in all, I'd just as soon blast the songs on my car stereo and sing along to them on my way to or from work.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I enjoyed the film, although its a little slow at first. Great fight scenes towards the end and it looks great on blue ray.
B000002VSN|5.0|I know Whitney loved the Lord and I hope Whitney knows the Lord loves her. This is where I believed she should have been.
B008V4H6N6|3.0|I expected this album to be better and I was a little let down. I found it to be a little commercial sounding in parts and I was bored with some tracks. It's not bad, maybe I'm being too harsh or picky? but I just wasn't that impressed. Other reviews had hyped up this album but if you enjoy quality underground electronic music that's original and different, then you won't be missing much if you skip this one. I suggest Kid Koala's 12 bit blues if you want some new interesting electronic music that's actually worth the money.
B00006GEB4|5.0|I already own the 5.1 surround CD version of this record and I have enjoyed it for many years. I just recently started buying vinyl, so this review is really just about the vinyl in general. Full disclosure: I am by no means an audiophilanthrotopianator (yes, I just made that up) and I have resisted vinyl throughout the entire resurgence simply because I love music, and I never spent any time  worrying about the mid-quasar frequency response variance algorithms (also made that up) between MP3, CD, or whatever. I think we can all agree that cassettes need to stay down.<br /><br />So I finally broke down because another recording came out on vinyl only... it was my only option - sneaky, right? What I have discovered since is that LPs are just a lot of fun. Music is integrated into my life now with the advent of phonep3 players and cloud streaming, and one thing I never realized I missed from my younger days was just the act of sitting down, pulling out a record/cassette/whatever, and having the listening be what was happening, not just the soundtrack to whatever else I was doing.<br /><br />I think this release really speaks to the fun of listening to music; the red vinyl, the cover art.. everything about it just says \\"have a good time with this record.\\" It doesn't hurt that the audio quality is really good, too. The only down side is that my cat is strangely attracted to the red vinyl and desperately wants to jump on the record player when its moving. If it gets scratched up from this I will buy another copy. Amazon's packaging is fantastic and new purchases always arrived well-protected and ready to play.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Ugh, it's a mess of a film.  Everybody loved the first Alien, most even loved the second one-Aliens.  Heck, I even kinda liked Alien 3(Alien 4 is a joke)...but this was a poorly written film.  Visually it looks pretty and the CGI stuff is generally good(it should be, the movie cost over 100 million to make), but as we all know pretty effects can't carry a movie.  This is supposed to be a prequel to Alien but in many ways it isn't.  Most of you will be left scratching your heads as to where in time this is supposed to take place.  Are they on the same planet that the first crew landed on in the first Alien?  In that movie the alien craft had thousands of eggs presumably carrying the face huggers.  In this film the ship had these canisters containing some form of contaminant or other.  It's never really explained.  Much isn't clear in this mess.  Here we have snake like things then an octopoid thing.  What are they? Dunno.  What made the original Alien so cool was the humans stumbling on a planetoid where a derelict craft had crashed, piloted by some unknown species.  In Prometheus that idea is being killed by somehow bringing humans into the mix by saying that that unknown species is really our creators.  That is that they are genetically linked to us thus taking the exotic feel of Alien 1 out of the equation.  To me that is a cop-out bit of writing and whoever green-lighted the idea is an idiot.  The acting was pretty wooden by all including Theron, with the possible exception of Rapace(she tried) and the guy who played the robot.  If you are a diehard fan of the original you'll be disappointed with this.  I certainly was.
B001AQR39O|5.0|Hank's the best!  His witty comebacks brighten my day.  I have been buying one season per month, and I can't wait to start watching season 3.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This was a delightful read, and a book I will purchase for others.  I must admit it took a few &#34;letters&#34; to get used to the fact that the entire book is in letters, oh but those letters are such a joy!  If you liked Saving CeCe Honeycutt, Fair and Tender Ladies,  Sugar Cage, and Before Women Had Wings...this just might be the book for you.  It was clever on many levels...not an academic accomplishment or intellectual writing.  For me, this is what reading should be:  missing the characters at the book's end....and it was so with this book.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Couldn't put it down!  Compelling, personal story of a true hero.<br /><br />Horrific war. Awesome military.  Spoiled civilians.  Crooked politicians.  Untrustworthy media.  Proud to be an American anyway thanks to men like this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book titled \\"Catching Fire\\" is about igniting a revolution.  And it was about time!!!  You will like how the story unfolds.  You will find that other characters are not as they seem.  Very good series.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|No doubt, when this was taken out of the brown Amazon box my child lost his poop.  He was wide-eyed and envious of himself for having this monster in his possession.  This thing fires darts and does it HARD and FAR!  We performed multiple \\"scientific\\" tests against his other 15 Nerf guns and this fired farther, made a louder \\"pop\\" when hitting the wall than any other gun in his collection.  It is quick and it holds an absurd number of darts. It's never jammed once.<br /><br />Now the \\"bad.\\"  It doesn't come with the max number of darts or clips to make this thing the envy of the whole neighborhood.  Really, the point of this gun is the fact that you can fire 144 darts non-stop while your friends are too confused by the raining darts of terror to even fire back.  If you are getting this as a gift this holiday season, you really do need to buy the extra clips and darts to ensure it hits the max (144) dart capacity.  Your kids will thank you!  If you don't, it is like buying a brand-new car with manual windows.  Your friends will be impressed by your shiny new vehicle but once they get in, they will wonder why you were too cheap to spend the extra for the power windows.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Captivating story.  Didn't think I would like a book written for young adults, but the plots made so much sense, and having seen the movie (not read the book), I could visualize characters as I read.  All the main characters appear throughout the series, and the writer invents some crazy games and creatures.  Fun!  You have to read it to appreciate it.  If you liked book 1, you need to finish the 3-part series.  Satisfying.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|(This was my review as originally posted at Reel Film News.)<br /><br />Coldplay have spent the last year touring in support of their new album \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" to much critical and audience acclaim. Their live show, augmented by the use of illuminating wristbands (called Xylobands) given to the audience, redefined the relationship between band and observer by making them an active part of the proceedings. On Monday, November 19, they will unleash Coldplay Live 2012 upon the home media market; it is a concert film culled from several performances, dating all the way back to their 2011 Glastonbury show to recent shows in Paris and Montreal. To hype this release further, they added a one-night only theatrical screening on November 13th at theaters worldwide. Locally, the new Angelika Mosaic and a few others were host to this screening, with the theater being filled with fans old and young, all delighted at the prospect of being able to witness this snapshot of this moment in Coldplay's history.<br /><br />It's tough being a Coldplay fan these days, with constant derision being heaped upon them and their fans. The \\"You know how I know you're gay?\\" sequence from the film The 40 Year-Old Virgin was just the first of many public tongue-lashings directed at Coldplay, with detractors left and right coming out of the woodwork to heap scorn upon them. With five studio albums and a relentless tour schedule, Coldplay have fired straight back with brilliant musicianship, heartfelt songs, and one of the most memorable stage shows ever to tour the earth. With Coldplay Live 2012, they are afforded the opportunity to show the world at large just how powerful their music and imagery can be; we also get each band member's own personal take on the tour, the touring life, and their own perceptions of themselves.<br /><br />Against a backdrop of graffiti, laser lights, swirling confetti, and computer imagery, Coldplay's 90-minute exercise in showmanship starts from the very beginning, wherethe raucous \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" blasts the audience into a frantic fervor. The Xylobands pop and flash, animating the audience and further enhancing the impact of the music. Chiefly caught on digital cameras by director Paul Dugdale, we are granted an upfront look at the band onstage, sweat and all, while they power through an ecstatic show at the Stade de France in Paris, which serves as this film's base performance. Songs captured during their appearances in Madrid, Montreal, the Hollywood Bowl, and Glastonbury are thrown in the mix to complement and contrast the Paris show. Every two or three songs, there's a break in the concert footage as each member provides a small narration about how the tour has affected them, and we are given a rare glimpse into their road lives and what their outlook on life is for these shows. It's also fun to see their playful moments; we see them driving around in stadium carts, playing soccer and ping-pong, and goofing off for the cameras. (Speaking of which, watch all the way past the credits.)<br /><br />Musically, Coldplay are at the top of their game. Sonically tight and soulful, their songs are given ample room to mesmerize on their own; the additional imagery only adds to the experience of the song, making the song both aurally and visually memorable. The sound, mixed by longtime collaborator Rik Simpson, is sure to grab your ears and make you notice sounds that you may never have noticed before - the wobbly synthesizers in \\"Charlie Brown\\" are a fine example of this. Also, the crowd noise is never too overpowering, yet enough of it is there to make you feel like you're right in the middle of the Stade de France. Additionally, it was nice to hear the instrumental synthesizer/keyboard tracks to some of their various songs underpinning each member's narration.<br /><br />This yearlong (and soon to be extended) tour has crossed the globe several times. Meticulously planned, rehearsed and executed, each performance ignites audienceseverywhere through exuberance and excitement, pulling out every stop in order to make the fans feel appreciated and wanted. Fireworks are set off at their outdoor stadium and pavilion shows; the band moves into the crowd to play a few songs from the back of the auditorium; sing-alongs are encouraged; and it doesn't hurt that they come off as some of the most genuinely nicest people to ever grace a stage. Coldplay Live 2012 captures the band at their best, and their best is good enough to beat any criticism any day of the week and twice on Sundays.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: A+<br /><br />Reel Film News Movie/DVD Review by Eddie Pasa
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Really a great movie for theater buffs who were young in the 80's.  Most of the songs are memorable.  The mashups are pretty good too.<br /><br />I would see at least one more time.  Put a smile on my face.
0061692042|2.0|The book goes on and on describing...  and constantly hints at what will happen.  When something interesting finally happens, the first half ends.  The second half is exactly the same!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was our November book club choice. I deferred reading for a couple of<br />weeks because I felt it would be depressing. However, I started it on a Tuesday<br />evening and finished on Thursday, having been busy most of Wednesday. It was a<br />book I could not put down once begun, but once finished, could not forget.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|I installed this game on 11/12 it worked just fine on my Samsung Note 2, Then i went to buy gems from the market the game forced closed on me.. and every time i try to play it it just force closes. Worthless game if I cant play. Now i have to deal with google and see if i can get a refund.
B0084I9QFU|5.0|I am a huge MJ fan, so I already actually owned the \\"Bad\\" album (including other special editions of it), but this special edition had way more bonus music tracks that the other ones have in the past, so I spent the money and got it anyhow. I am so glad I did because the bonus stuff on this is awesome, and I love how the booklet with it has a bit of info on each of the bonus tracks.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|I can't believe that this story has moved me so much! To mot remember the day before!<br />And the other side of the story, so powerful and gripping, I kept wondering who it was and what was wrong!
B008KE3960|5.0|this is such a great twist to tower defense games.  I've been paying it for days, replaying levels to try and better my scores.  If you are a fan of tower defense type games, you must try this one.  It does have in-app purchases, but I have not bought anything, so you don't have to spend to enjoy if you don't want to.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is an awesome app, I use it to help put my 6 week old to sleep.  Some awesome sounds I may use myself to fall asleep one of these days :)
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|The Time Keeper was a lovely book - sweet, and very poignant. It was nice to read a book which didn't contain violence, war, over-the-top romance, and wasn't too heavy to read. Very glad I bought it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|\\"Babel\\" is the sophomore album from Mumford & Sons.  It is just as amazing as \\"Sigh No More\\".  These songs are not as haunting but still have the awesome banjo and folk vibe that takes Bluegrass/Irish traditional and puts a bit of rock to make the fresh sound that has been lacking in contemporary music for a long time.  This album is like going home again.  It is a beautiful look into the souls of these 4 men.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  It is easy to read and suspensful.  Hated it to end.  I recommend this book and plan on reading more of John Grisham.  This was the first Grisham book I have read.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|It is a must buy for Lego lovers. It is so cool the details are amazing. Only problem is you might get too in to it!
B009LL4LMM|1.0|Spy spy spy. This is a bad invasive game. No sit I don't like it. Cus it's bad credit history of the office to get a copy
B000J103WK|1.0|I ended up receiving two copies of this DVD and neither one of them would play in any of 5 different DVD players.  I thought the first DVD was defective so returned it and got a second one.  One might think I am a klutz and don't understand formats and variations of DVD.  The DVD listed it as NSTC and HD.  I tried it in a Sony Blue Ray player, three different computer DVD players, and a Panasonic portable DVD player.  None of them would even recognize the DVD.  I don't know what the problem is, but this DVD is hosed up as far as I am concerned.  I ordered it because a friend has the 2 DVD set of this concert and I saw it and liked it.  There is something wrong with this one DVD album.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|Great geek movie -- glad to finally own it.  Nexus 06 is the name of the main android in the movie. Google's Nexus 7 is the next in the android series.
B00A12VW86|4.0|Dos! should be taken in big doses. It offers the pure genius that is Green Day. Just keep it away from the young children.<br />I love the last song, Amy, the tribute to Amy Winehouse.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|very good app, you need someway to get to the different folders on the Kindle Fire, this one does fine for it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I read this book mainly because I'm just starting out as a runner and was interested in the barefoot running aspect of the book. The story is probably most interesting to ultra marathoners. The main character is the author, but the focus of the book is on ultra marathon runners, such as the Tarahumara indians in Mexico and a man who called himself Micah True, called Caballo Blanco by the Mexicans. The idea of running 50+ miles in the heat of Mexico and at night with all of the creepy crawlers does not interest me at all, and the people who do are nuts. (I can't even run a half marathon, yet, but working on getting there!)<br /><br />The runners who read this will be able to relate to the runners in the book; non-runners will enjoy reading about the struggles that the people in the book go through to accomplish their goals. And those of us who are married/related to runners can relate to the craziness of what the runners go through (and know that my husband is not the only crazy runner out there)!<br /><br />I have the book on my Kindle. My husband is a marathoner, so I've passed it over to him to read. He couldn't wait for me to finish it so he could read it. Lucky for him, I'm a fast reader. :-)
1619695006|2.0|Even though I knew this would be nothing like Harry Potter, I did expect some plot, or something to actually happen to make the book exciting. Neither plot or excitement exists; however, there is a moral to the story, which is demonstrated by how cruel and petty people can be to each other. Mrs. Rowling must have had a passionate reason to write this book, perhaps based on personal experience at some time in her life or perhaps just an observation. Nevertheless, it is a downer. If you still decide to read this book, I recommend the audio version over the printed version so that the proper tone/accent is given to the printed word, especially if you are not familiar with the British dialect.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|netflix blueray is chopped . 12 minutes are missing. A fight scene with the alien/human man in lifeboat ship vs woman with ax,the alien ship rolling over a woman,and i think more of a love scene, and probably more small snips of scenes,all of that I would never have known was missing had I not rented from amazon first witch also included deleted and extended scenes not on the blry. dvd. 7.1 surround sound was great though.wish I could put them together without buying this movie.I just rememberd some of the fight scene with the alien/human in the alien cockpit was gone.My r rated version was only a pg.In my opinion the netflix version is not worth seeing if your a fan of this series,except for the 7.1
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great application. love that it saves the last calculation you have made while you do other things so it is there when you return. do far I wouldn't change a thing!!!
1449410243|5.0|This book was a gift and it was exactly what she wanted. It arrived ahead of schedule. Will do business with this company again.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Xtina is one of the only few artists that is able to make me feel true emotions when listening to her ballads.. teary every time!  Personally i didn't think Bionic was bad like critics were making it out to be.  This album has so much potential, i really hope her management team will step up this time and release the songs more strategically to truly showcase them as the hits that they are!!
B003Y5H556|5.0|I will always buy from amazon.The quality was great the case was in great condition thank you.love this site I buy everything I can from here.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I do not like this game . It is hard to understand. I looked up directions for this game and it still didnt help much.
0525478817|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  I loved the dialogue between the characters--it was honest, raw, and so clever.  John Green was able to create characters that came alive, were believable, easy to love.  You won't regret spending a few hours reading this book.  Don't start it too late at night, because you won't be able to put it down.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Very interesting read that keeps you coming back for more.  Strange is not an adequate description for the construction of this saga but in spite of or maybe because of the construction you keep wanting to know what's next and what happens to the key characters.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I purchased this item for my husband as a going away gift. He is currently deployed out of the country and couldn't be happier with this portable gaming system. Thank you for such a prompt delivery.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is one of the best television series, ever.  Claire Danes' performance is amazing and at times heart-breaking.  Great plot!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love the 3rd season so far. It's definitely kicking it up a notch. The 2nd season was great but it's a relief to see everyone has FINALLY turned into badasses. I only give a 4 star because I really don't like the blonde chick. I haven't liked her since season 1. She's even worse this year, she seems to be drunk all the time or her lips have too much injections. I just don't like her, I can't even remember her name. I say get rid of her and focus on Michonne.
B009SCRERI|5.0|My almost four year old daughter, absolutely LOVES this movie.  If you have seen any of the other Disney Fairy movies, you will not be disappointed.  I have to say that this is my personal favorite and I'm the momma!  My only complaint is that I wish this had been released in the movie theatre as I would have really enjoyed watching this on the big screen with my daughter.  The animation is lovely and the songs are sweet.
0307887448|3.0|I enjoyed this book overall but I was tempted to give it one star to bring down its average since it's way too high, but I know that's not the right thing to do.<br /><br />I find it hard to imagine that anybody who was not a kid in the late 70s or early 80s could enjoy Ready Player One.  It's like the author tried to think of every possible thing a geek of that generation would have liked and then decided to mention EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM in the book, ad nauseam.  And I'm saying this as a person who got almost every one of his references and liked almost every one of those games/movies/etc.  Also the book was a little predictable to me, but surely not for everybody.<br /><br />I did enjoy being taken to a place that to me was new and original (i.e. the future and the \\"OASIS\\"), and I will admit that it was hard to put the book down at times.<br /><br />I can't believe they're going to turn this into a movie that will only appeal to less than half a percent of the population...
B004V5A7K8|2.0|My first blocks game was on ATARI and it was actually called Breakout. That was a great game and I assumed this game was similiar, it was not. This is just a basic block game with no interesting attributes at all.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|One of my favorite albums from my college years, redone...  Again.  I think it is worth a purchase, particularly if you only have the original CD.  This has a very clean sound on high quality headphones, and is cleaner than you will need on even a great high powered car audio system.  Most of you will not have equipment that will reproduce the lowest bass notes at a flat level - a Peter Gabriel trademark.  This will not take away from your enjoyment of the album...  It just sounds great.<br />I was a fan of his earlier work, but think of this album in the same way I think about Metallica's \\"Black Album.\\"  It is an album where the artist reaches down to the mass market to try to bring them into the fold.  This album makes his true fans happy, while allowing new fans to click into where he is coming from.<br />Definitely worth a listen if you have not heard it.  You may lose attention near the end, but stick it out.  Truly a great album with some of his best mainstream hits.  Despite being mainstream, they are still great songs.<br />This album was originally recorded digitally, but it has always been released with an analog stage along the processing or pressing.  From what I can tell, this is as close to the digital master as I can hear and is a worthy re-release.  Even more so than the last remasteres that were issued.
B00846REIS|5.0|So so so much better than fifty! It doesn't even compare so I'll stop there but wow! This is so well written and thought out! The characters are so developed and it's such a hot relationship between the characters.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I love this movie! Great move to watch again and again. Nice artwork on cover and sturdy plastic cover to keep your DVD safe for years to come.
B008EKON56|3.0|The FiiO L11 works as described, Line-Out and Charging works flawlessly. However this item is not compatible with many iPhone and iPod cases. The L11 is rectangle shaped and not oblong/oval like an actual Apple 30-pin connector. I tried 4 different iPhone 4 cases and 2 different iPod touch 3G cases and the L11 would not work. It could not be plugged in to either device completely because of the case. FiiO should redesign this to fit the same profile as a 30-pin dock connector. There are several items fitting that profile but the reviews are not as good as the ones for the FiiO L11. I will be returning it to purchase a combined USB Charger/Line-Out cable.
1469984202|5.0|Cutting my teeth on The Survivalist series by Jerry Ahern as a kid and playing Fallout 3 as an adult(kid), this story plays well with my interests - post apocalypse, survival, and the question of vault/bunker/silo existence for long periods.  John Rourke had the benefit of cryogenic sleep.  These folks went on living.  Incredible tale, character development, and how well the environment is detailed to paint a vivid mental image of the conditions.  I put it up there with Ender's Game and Starship Troopers (the book by Robert A. Heinlein, not the movie... please lend me some credit).  Great stuff, do yourself a favor and read it.  Can't wait for the movie!!!
B007N8RULO|4.0|this app is a great time killer. keeps me occupied while i watch tv or at night when i cant sleep. the only issue ive had is that the sound freezes sometimes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|More up-to-date in terms of geopolitics than most. And of course the fluid action of the story. Does Vince Flynn really needs reviews..
B004J4WN0I|5.0|For some reason it took about a year and a half for me to locate this book. I saw all the reviews for it, read the summary and decided this was something I had to read. It took forever for me to finally get it and I will admit I forgot about it for a while. To be completely honest I bought both the digital and paper versions of this book because I liked it that much and wanted to support the author.<br /><br />I love Atticus so much, the things that come out of his mouth or even the things he thinks about are just completely unbelievable and hilarious. I tend to read in public so i often look insane trying not to laugh to hard, usually wiping tears from my eyes. I sometimes wonder if he is based off of Kevin himself, in that case he has to be an awesome guy.<br /><br />I won't give away any details even tho if you read the first review the details are there, but i loved it. I tried my hardest to stretch the book out. I read quite fast and once i get attached i wont stop even if i know i have work in the morning and i need to sleep. But yes if you have not read it yet... GET IT!!! THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!!!
B00530FC6O|5.0|I laughed out loud reading this book.  It is so well crafted.  I seldom read any thing written this well.  It was  reccommeded to me by two writers and how riight they were.
B003QSEKTU|3.0|This movie was really cute. Zac Efron did a great job. Vanessa Hudgens, gorgeous and the supporting actors helped round out this final sequel. If you enjoy musicals you'll enjoy this.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Hunger Games is an amazing and thrilling film with an EXCELLENT story.  The notion of Panem, the characters, districts, and the rich are all worth watching in this film.  I do hope Mocking Jay (the second book in the series) comes out on film very soon, I do plan to own this movie because that is how fabulous it is!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It was a good movie, more intellectual version of alien.  The Action and special effects were outstanding.  It has an innovative plot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm so glad they finally made it I have been waiting for months best game ever everyone should seriulously get it
1609611543|5.0|This is a very good book, I couldn't stop reading. Being diabetic, I found a lot of useful information about controlling my carb intake. I have been cutting out much, not all yet, of the wheat I consume. I have gone from using insulin to being able to go back on metformin. I check my sugar often and it is much better and more stable. I hope to get to a point where I don't use any meds for diabetes but will always check my sugar to be safe.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Although I had to make a list of the characters from the start of the book to keep them straight, so I could read it on my Kindle, the interaction of the first book's children and the different countries is just so exciting. Can't wait for the last book of the trilogy.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I had to read this book for an English project when comparing The Giver to The Scarlet Letter. It was a good book and I would definitely read it again. Lowry is a fantastic writer and I have read her other books, which of course were fantastic. Even though this book isn't that long, the plot is wonderful and exciting!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I like it because it helps protect the Kindle and when reading, it is almost like holding a book.  It is very comfortable to hold.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just received the Kindle for my birthday and downloaded 1 book before Hurricane Sandy hit. Finally made a great choice. Really couldn't put it down, my husband was getting angry with me for reading too much! This book got me through a week without electricity/heat/tv/internet, although I read it in 2 days. Keeps you guessing, well written.
0525953590|5.0|Sean Carroll is a great writer, with his own brand of penmanship. He elegantly introduces particle physics without the mathematical jargon that can be confusing to some scientifically illiterate readers, which is a good thing if his goal is to explicate this topic to the masses. It does contain some repetitive info though, especially if you have already browsed through a bunch theoretical physics books. However, Sean Carroll's book does have an advantage, since the discovery of the particle, that seems to be the Higgs boson, was just around the corner. If you are interested in particle physics, amazed by the standard model's newly discovered member, and eager to fill your curiosity bucket with as much information as possible, than this book is a must read for you.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|This is the first autowind watch I have ever owned, and the second Seiko watch I've owned.  I read the other reviews and decided to give the watch a try.  The watch size is very good for my wrist size, not too big but big enough you can see the face easily. As other reviewers noted, this autowind watch is very dependent on how long it is worn and the activity level of the person wearing it.  I wear mine about 12 hours per day and the tendency at the present (I've only had the watch a couple of weeks)is for the watch to gain a few minutes after a few days so I suspect it is gaining a minute or so per day.  Whether that will change with a few months I don't know yet.  Over all, I'm satisfied with the watch, it looks good (not too military even wisth the green band) and I think with time, the tendency to gain time will diminish.  Price was right so no qualms here!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Before I began watching the Total Recall the remake, I was expecting it to follow closely to the original.  Which in some sort of way it did, but I'm still trying to figure out how.  Let's just say if you saw the original and loved it, you'll probably be disappointed by this one.  The visual effects are great and who doesn't love seeing Kate Beckinsale.  If you haven't had the opportunity to see the original, I urge you to give it a try (I know its old).  Like other reviewers have said, they were confused on what was going on through the movie.  I can see why.  If you haven't seen the original and knew what the plot was before hand, this movie can leave you dumbfounded.  It's very unstructured, doesn't explain the premise very well and is just a bunch of flashy effects.<br />If I could do it again, I would skip watching this movie and find the original and have a better experience.  Other than the supporting actors and the great visual effects, I personally did not enjoy this movie.
0062082353|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book by an awesome Patriot! I recommend highly.  I bought it for several people after reading, because they all share their support for our troops as much as I do.  So far, not one has had a bad thing to say!  Thank you for your service Chris Kyle!
B003VANOFY|5.0|If your looking for a headset that has alot of features and works well. This is it, Wireless option is nice to have. 10hr battery life with full charge. You can go around the house with the headset on. And program one of the buttons for push to talk. Dont miss a beat. Must buy for PC ppl.
0307730697|5.0|I did not know anything about Adam Brown.  This book was recommended to me through Amazon, they know my taste, so I bought it.  I have never been more touched by a story in my life.  The things this Navy Seal went through just to turn his life around and become an elite warrior is just simply amazing.  God Bless Adam Brown and his family.
159448385X|5.0|It is debatable if this book was better than \\"The Kite Runner\\", a book from the same author. I liked this story better, because the story touched me more. In both books, the author immersed the readers to the world of lives in Afghanistan. I do not grow up in the middle east and do not know much about lives in the middle east. Real or not, the stories were believable and took readers through emotional roller coasters.
0385474547|5.0|I read Things Fall Apart several years ago, and then I taught it in an AP Literature class in high school.  The author helped me to understand that the Western perspective, and even the perspective of Christian missionaries, while well-meaning can also sometimes be harmful in other cultures.  It is so easy to see things through the lens of our own culture and not realize how things may look different in another culture.  There is lots of \\"food for thought\\" in the book!
B006UN3FTY|5.0|The title of my review says it all really. I have known this book since the 1970's as a boy. Paddington has been part of my life,ever since and I have shared him with countless classes of children. I've yet to meet one whose life hasn't been touched by him and I'm sure that on a spiritual plane, Paddington exists somehow as a little blessing from God. Just lovely.
B006H5120E|5.0|Excellent movie! Well conceived and directed. The state-of-art technology that was used in this blu-ray version is astonishing.<br />The only dissapointment came when I didn't get the digital copy of the movie because of not being a US resident...
B008ER9QKG|4.0|This New Ring Recording is the one which any Wagnerian should watch.<br />I LIKE THIS PRODUCTION and recommed to classic lovers.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw the DVD version of this movie which was of high quality in terms of sound and visuals. But the blu-ray version, especially in 3D, is jaw-dropping! There is such synchronicity between sound and visual effects that you'll want to watch it over and over! Highly recommended!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app keeps my kids busy when we have to take long trips. I recommend it!!! My kids definitely take time to go through the levels and they seem to have a lot of fun doing it.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|It is a marvelous book that everyone should read once at least. Marcus Aurelius, an emperor and a philosopher, speaks to us from his heart. I could hear his voice speaking through his simple words though separated by time and space. His words are so true that even now, in twentyfirst century also, we are having the same problems that he faced in his time and the solutions he found are true even now.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|brilliant use of hauntingly lovely photos. i now lust after the hardcover version.  a charming flawed hero of a mysterious family.  cant wait for the next one.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very disappointed with this book.  Expected a faster read. Had too many<br />names and story lines to follow. Had to stop reading because too much<br />to keep up with.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This book is in parts moving, humorous, thought provoking and deep. An overall superb novel by an equally superb author
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Having just got a newborn I was in the market for an iPhone friendly baby monitor. I came across this product and I have to be honest, I was dubious how it would perform. I have bought many iPhone accessories that use Wifi before and sometimes they over promise and under deliver. Not so with the Withings WithBaby product. This thing is awesome. It was extremely easy to setup, recognised my home network immediately and configuration was done in under 30 secs. It works completely as advertised and not only that it had a few surprises for me.<br /><br />I was sceptical it work across the Internet and 3G. Tried it...no problem! Of course, performance is a little degraded as you are running it across mobile data but still it performed acceptably. I was also surprised that Withings had taken the time to make native iPad apps and also that more than 1 person can connect at a time. Let me say that again. MORE THAN ONE PERSON CAN CONNECT AT A TIME. That was pretty awesome. Both my wife and I can monitor my little guy simultaneously.<br /><br />All in all....awesome product I use on my iPhone 5 and iPad. I can't speak highly enough of it. Oh...and nicely designed as well!
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Loved the book, mostly because of the characters and the country. very easy reading. Enjoyed the second book Death Without Company and am ready to get the third.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I recently heard about this group and immediately fell in love with their music.  While a few of the songs are readily recognized from the radio, all of the songs on this CD are worth listening too.  It's the type of CD that I enjoy more and more every time I listen to it.  It is an awesome buy!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|great movie, top notch. recommend to all. the price is fair. the movie has great effects and sound. hope for part 2 soon. thanks
B007L6VR12|2.0|Despite all of the positive ratings, I wasn't too impressed with this one. Director Wes Anderson frames his takes like works of art -- each scene carefully set. However, the script by Anderson and Roman Coppola does not dazzle like \\"[[ASIN:B0000640VJ The Royal Tenenbaums (The Criterion Collection)]], [[ASIN:B00003Q42P Rushmore (The Criterion Collection)]], or [[ASIN:B001EOQCIK Bottle Rocket (The Criterion Collection)]], where those films characters are memorable and liven up the story and screen. This film falls more in the same category with Anderson's lackluster films [[ASIN:B0007UC8Y4 The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)]] and [[ASIN:B003KGBIRU The Darjeeling Limited (The Criterion Collection)]] -- films that are too artistic as well as lack any emotion in dialogue or acting. I loved the previous three and [[ASIN:B00364K6J2 Fantastic Mr. Fox (Ws)]], but this one contains not much that is memorable (including the two leads, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward). Veteran actors like Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Harvey Keitel are wasted. The true standouts of the film are the Khaki Scout troop 55 boys; they had some of the best parts in the film. I think Anderson should re-team up with Owen Wilson on writing duties since his best work (\\"Tenenbaums,\\" \\"Rushmore,\\" \\"Bottle Rocket\\") has been with him. Lately, Anderson seems more style than substance and while his films look great, it doesn't make them memorable for why they should be: for being a well-written, well-performed film.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg this game is so much fun yet its so addicting! I reccomend it to anyone who's not sure of buying it!
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Having seen both Tora! Tora! Tora! and 2001's Pearl Harbour (directed by Michael Bay), I can safely say that Tora! Tora! Tora! (Japanese for Tiger, Tiger, Tiger!) is not only 1 of my all-time favorite movies, by far the MOST historically accurate depiction of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, compared to the aforementioned 2001 film. About the 2-disk collector's edition DVD, I think it's awesome. Gives me every reason to own this film on that format, and comes with a massive amount of entertaining extras. If you want an accurate depiction of the attack on Pearl Harbor, watch Tora! Tora! Tora! It's amazing!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I'm hooked!  This is an awesome series!  How did I miss this on PBS?..  Kinda happy I did.  Fun watching all at one time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I missed the 3rd episode & couldn't wait for Sunday to catch the rerun so I ordered it online. Perfect quality.
0307730697|5.0|One of the best books ever!  What a special young man.  Gave  this book to my Dad.  He loved it too!
B009IU6N5Y|5.0|This movie was riveting.  Excellent writing and outstanding performance by all actors.  I recommend this to all who enjoy action and drama.
0446580848|3.0|There is a good story here, but I feel that I wasted 2 or even 3 hours of my time as the author dragged it out so long. One way to cut it would have been to leave out at least half of John Corey's dumb wisecracks, which were especially irritating earlier in the novel. The trip to Aden by convoy was also something that could easily have been left out. Th author sure has  it our for Yemen,and perhaps with just cause. The Panther himself was one of the least likely bad guys I have seen in novels like this. I did like the two other characters almost equally as bad and thought their development in the story was just fine. Before fans give me an unhelpful vote, know that I have read all of DeMilles' novels- I am a fan. He has some novels out there that are far better than this one. I did finish the entire novel, and enjoyed much of it. I'd say about 400 pages of it!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this app is a total ripoff of minecraft!! if u have ever played mine craft and u look at the pictures the almost exactly alike!!
B000066744|5.0|I don't know how this movie didn't get more press when it came out.  It's basically a fairytale about a man born on a ship who never leaves it.<br />The plot, soundtrack, and acting are all wonderful.
1616890835|5.0|As a sign painter, I feel it is about time that sign painting gets recognized as the high quality, respected craft that it was...and that it still is.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I discovered Mumford & Sons through an author who's books I love. I've been waiting on this album forever and have been disappointed. Some of the songs have the same feel as their first album, but I still enjoyed them.
B00976QBBU|5.0|Got this CD for my 9 year old. He loves it and I love to watch.him dance to this great music
B0074V33MK|4.0|The author, Eric Lomax, served as an officer in the British Army in WW2.  He was stationed in Singapore when he was captured by the Japanese when Singapore surrendered.  In this book he describes first his love of trains, then his searing captivity and torture while a prisoner of war, and then his reconciliation with one of the Japanese who tormented him during his imprisonment.<br /><br />This book caught my attention for several reasons:  I served in Bangkok with the United States Army during 1973-1974, I also love trains, and I also served in Japan during my Army service.  When I was in Thailand, I road the railroad from Bangkok to the Burmese border over the Kwai bridge several times.  The raiload was unchanged since WW2.  The wooden trestles were still in place as was the River Kwai bridge.<br /><br />The British military cemetary described by the author was a 30 minute boat ride down the river from the bridge.  It was a place of serenity and beauty, full of gravestones marking the last resting places of young men from all over the British Empire.  There was no hint of the violence and suffering endured by the author and other prisoners.<br /><br />Snce then the area has become a tourist attraction.  The book would have been better had it included photographs of the railroad just after or during the war and then when the author returned.<br /><br />The book was most powerful when it described the author's growing up with trains and then his captivity.  It was at its weakest when the author described his reconciliation with one of his captors.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those with an interest in WW2 and the Thai Burma railroad in particular.
B0042RJWTC|2.0|AWESOME series!  Too bad we could not warch it in its entirety, however.  I wish I would have paid more attention to the people who said they had problem with the discs.  About a third of the way into the series, we experienced difficulties with the discs and could not continue. What a letdown since we were enjoying is so much! Amazon Customer Service is assisting us - but we will have to purchase it somewhere else...DO watch it though! :)
0596009208|4.0|I am a software engineer with little experience in OOA/OOD/OOP. I found this book very easy to follow and with my Linux machine in front of me, I did a lot of the sample code with little to no problems.There are still a few mistakes in the provided code but it wasn't hard to figure out what was wrong.
1452105111|5.0|Very colorful, sturdy and fun!  Great bargain for my favorite theme. We are using it in a preschool room to welcome new students.
B0024RID60|3.0|I've got four of the other Stones albums on the Virgin remasters from '94 and bought this UM release brand new thinking it would be at least equal to that, but no .. the sound quality of this release is just plain not-good.  It does not compare to the quality of the '94 remasters.  It sounded extra lousy in my car.  Plus, my Sony Blu-Ray player couldn't even ID this disk using it's online music service.  That's how little respect this version deserves.  If you want this album on CD, please look at the box showing the other versions and click on the '94 remaster and get one of those used.  After listening to this one that's what I did.  Five stars for the content, one star for the hatchet job divided by two equals three stars.
0061765236|5.0|I really loved this book. I loved the way Picoult went from present to past, seamlessly telling the story of many characters through different perspectives. She writes about the grief and heartache of suicide while at the same time making the story exciting and easy to read.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|This book is not your average John Grisham thriller, although it does revolve around a lawyer. It is not a literary work of art; it tells more than it shows. It is a page turner; Grisham will keep you guessing from start to finish. It is fantastic; a bold adventure into the unlikely and improbable. It is one hell of an entertaining story.<br /><br />The book opens with the main character, a disgraced lawyer, in prison, a victim of an overzealous FBI. We travel with this character as he negotiates his way to freedom, as he manipulates authorities and criminals alike in an effort to reclaim a life destroyed.<br /><br />It is hard to describe this tale without giving it away and there will be no spoilers here. I fought sleep to finish the book; it keeps you asking 'why' and 'what's he doing now'.
B001ANYDAO|2.0|So, I just read chapter 9 from Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. The title is, Marita's Bargain. The context is a Bronx school program called KIPP and inner city disadvantaged kids. The disadvantage being, middle class parents building up their kids during the summer break while poor kids just languish over the summer doing nothing. He upset me when he said, \\"It is not the brightest who succeed, If it were, Chris Langan would be up there with Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is rather, a gift.\\" Got that folks, we are not in charge of our own destiny. You didn't build any thing you think you worked hard for. I just lost total respect for this mans writing abilities, which I might add, he's just lucky he has. He even goes as far as saying, anyone of us could be in Bill Gate's shoes and accomplished the same thing given the same scenario. What a crock.
B00932A2MC|3.0|I was in the mood for a special effects sci-fi, and this fit the bill perfectly.  It's a fun movie, lots of special effects.  But don't look for any unique story here.  It's largely a re-telling of the same plot from many other similar movies that came before.
0740748475|5.0|Bill Watterson is a unique artist who captures the essence of male prepubescent dreams and desires through a boy named Calvin and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes.  The duo encounter many obstacles and overcome the tyrannous rule of their adult superiors through sheer determination, imagination, and a little luck.  Great for all ages.  Calvin and Hobbes have grown with me through the years and they have helped make some rough times seem not so bad.  I highly recommend that a fan of the series get these 3 volumes, and for those people who have never read Watterson's comic, I sincerely urge you to check it out.  Very clever.  Brilliant, even.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  Man do u fall in love with Gideon.  He is so hot.  I wish their separation wasn't for so long and so painful.  I cannot wait for the third book.  I need more very badly.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Lost my tan leather case at school today and I will definitely buy another one. Upon first inspection it seemed way too tight and it took me about 5 minutes and a minor heart attack to find a way to get my phone out of it again. but after using it for a couple of days the material stretches a little bit and becomes softer which makes it a perfect fit for the iPhone 5. I absolutely love the tan leather although it took on some blue color from my jeans after a while but that is to be expected. The only think I disliked about this case is the card slot. It's too long which makes me worried about losing my card in there and not being able to get it out again, so I haven't been using it at all. But it makes the design look nicer so It's not really a draw-back. Perfect case for anybody who doesn't like to ruin the good looks of the iPhone with a plastic case.
0316789704|5.0|My 17-year-old daughter wanted this for her birthday.  She has used it over and over since then.  Once for illustrating a childrens' book for school.  It turned out great.<br /><br />We have many of Ed Emberley's books.  Every one of them is a great book to have.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|In the mode of Grisham's better books. Well paced and keeps you wanting to continue to the end. With a holdout that explains why the central chacter weaves to the climax.

B0002DXEPI|5.0|What a great movie.  Julie Andrews is amazing as always.  Great music, and plot, all combined in to a slap stick comedy.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I didn't expect to like a \\"dark\\" version of Snow White but I realy enjoyed this movie. I found it to be beautiful in a haunting sort of way.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|The Beatles and I come from the same era. The movie was interesting even more so because a friend's photographs were used in the movie for the time George and Pattie came to the Haight-Ashbury, which I remember and considered a true representation of the era. The movie has a lot of interesting details about George and the Beatles.
B009PAETCG|5.0|Thought it would be a dumb idea but after playing it a few times I couldn't put my phone down! Try it!
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. the puzzles get more difficult as you play but what I like is that the puzzles aren't so difficult that they can't be solved. I also like that the application turns off when I exit it.

1469984202|5.0|Many of the reviews have already touched on the story, so I won't rehash what has been said.  I feel lucky to have found this story as a recommendation after reading Ready Player One.  This story pulled me in immediately.  The writers style is deliberate, immersive, and at times poetic.  The world he has created is so vivid and the characters so real it made for a compelling read.<br /><br />I am suggesting this story to all of my friends. Absolutely one of my favorites this year!
B004A8ZX28|3.0|I felt that this movie started off with a lot of promise but it got way too Hollywood at the end with all the stereotypical touches. Super assasin with amnesia. Car chases. Some many shades of the Bourne Identity that you wonder why they bothered to make it. It is entertaining at times and not a complete disappiontment, but it needs some work.

0525952926|1.0|I am very disappointed in the second book of Folletts Century Trilogy. The first book was such an enjoyable read, I couldn't wait to get started on this one. I'm 300 pages in and I'm almost ready to just throw it out and go read something else. The characters are no where near as interesting as the first book. The writing is terrible, the dialogue is terrible and I don't care about anybody in this book. I am doggedly making my way through, but it's so uninteresting that I'm having trouble following the story.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|full net access, write to SD &amp; prevent phone from sleeping...what's so horrible about that?? Needs full net access to post to Facebook/twitter(which is OPTIONAL)...<br />Great physics game w/dozens of levels. I played til I had to go to work. Either dev changed permissions VERY recently...or y'all too sensitive...
B000W8HC8I|5.0|The Wolf of Wall Street = Boiler Room meets Blow with a sprinkle of Scarface<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the movie coming out next year :-)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book until the end. It was well written with many unexpected twists. It was interesting to be inside the head of both of the main characters. It was strange to be privy to the thoughts and feelings of one character and then the next chapter you see how the actions and words were interpreted by the other main character. I don't recall ever reading a book that did this. Flynn did a very good job with this.<br /><br />It felt as I got deeper into the book that I was also getting deeper into the minds of both characters. Flynn shared their true feelings and thoughts in layers. The more layers revealed, the more wicked they became. I flipped back and forth between empathy and revulsion for both of them.<br /><br />It is an exceptional read except .... Flynn didn't finish the book. It just .... ended. I kept flipping through the credits thinking that there was a mistake in page placement and I would find the rest of the book. But no, the writer just stopped writing.<br /><br />That is why I had to wait several weeks to come back and write my review. I didn't want to write when I was angry.<br /><br />Read the book but be prepared for non-ending.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I'm a big Lee Child (Jack Reacher) fan, my husband and I have read all the previous books.  I was disappointed with this latest effort.  Some of the chapters were waaaay long and tedious, I had a hard time getting on board with the story and I NEVER have trouble maintaining interest in a Jack Reacher book!  I didn't hate the book, just not as entertaining or addictive as the rest of the series.  I will still recommend Lee Child and Jack and hope that the next installment is improved.
111846446X|5.0|Very helpful item. No of course we wouldn't expect this book to just automatically come with a 25-35 dollar Rasberry Pi. The whole concept of the Pi is to keep costs down for the millions of creative souls in the whole world. This book is quite helpful and definite worth buying. Found the best price here on Amazon. And wish we had even more info in written form out there. Hope there are more books to come and thanks Rasberry Pi inventors and Sony. What a great gift to the world. Also beware people you can find the Pi in it's latest update on electronic sites..you might need to do some searching but it beats any prices here on Amazon today anyway and on the famous on line auction site. There's always people who are going to jump on the back of goodwill and try to make money I suppose. Not Amazon's fault just only sellers so far that have signed up on them. I suspect there will be more competition over time to bring these prices down to the ideal USA 35 tag.<br /><br />Really people you expect a 20+ dollar book to be thrown in with a 35 dollar device for free or what? You can always like us pick it up in addition and maybe some enterprising seller will offer them bundled but bet they charge more than the two bought separate today. Think outside the box...and is a house full of Pi's a house divided by Pi? And could two Pi's make a baby Pi? A little Pi humor...folks:)) Very happy with our piece of Pi and the book is the ala mode.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is one of my favorite authors but having said that, I found this book to be more to my taste than a few of the ones that came before it. It was a page turner with housework and errands neglected until I regretfully finished the book. I loved it.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This is surprisingly an awesome entry in the TNG novels (although given the author I shouldn't have been surprised). Although not a Typhon Pact novel, it furthers the Pact story well too. I was skeptical when I came across part 2, but ended up being engrossed in the first person narrative spanning years. I agree with some other reviewers, though; the ending is a bit of an anticlimax. But there are two more of the miniseries to go.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|a mediocre story capped off by grisham admittimg he was lazy, which was obvious on more than 1 occassion. disappointing in many ways. the least of which was $13 price.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|At last the 1st of the series translated- a good piece but in places the clues were telegraphed too early.

0553386794|5.0|I bought this book on Audible. Audible is kind of like Netflix for audible books. Anyway, I was driving a lot, and it made sense.<br /><br />THIS IS AWESOME. I was so impressed with the complexity of the characters, the unexpected and blatantly much more believable storyline, and the dialogue. While several novels I've recently read containing good internal dialogue, the conversations have sucked. The Game of Thrones did not have this problem. This is book definitely worth purchase. I'm now on book 4!

B0067AC5KA|5.0|The trilogy was a thriller.  And getting the trilogy was good for me since one story led into the next.  I was just sorry after reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, that there would be no further continuation.  Highly recommend this if you have the time to curl up and read a good series.

B003X2O6KW|1.0|I am not rating this one star based on the musical content, in fact, I love this album. It is brilliantly crafted and is one of my favoritve albums of the past 5 years. I am rating it one star however because I purchased it not knowing it was the clean version. The seller did not note it at all in the title and I wish it had because it would have saved me the money spent on returning the product. I am very disappointed with Amazon and would like to see this changed soon.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|it was worth $1.99 cant wait for the second one :) Great hidden objects and puzzle game and the story line wasnt bad either...
1439152802|5.0|Both the long standing fans of Kate Morton's previous novels as well as those for whom THE SECRET KEEPER is a first introduction to this author will have their thirst for a great read completely quenched.  This is the perfect novel for dreary winter days in front of the fire and as with her previous novels, Ms. Morton revisits her ongoing predilection for the theme of family secrets. The characters and clues reveal themselves more slowly in this one, as the story moves back and forth between the blitz in WWII England, an event in the 1960's and current times.<br /><br />With its subtle twists, great settings, addictive writing and characteristic surprise ending, this tale of friendship, love and deception unspools as a successful 60 something year old daughter searches for answers to a past event and to her details of mothers past as she and her siblings attempt to come to terms with their mother's impending death.  I will not divulge any more of the plot for fear of disclosing information that will render this reading experience less compelling for the reader.  Suffice to say that the allusions and ambiguity created by Ms. Morton are certain to keep readers engrossed and their grey matter stimulated.<br /><br />If the works of Maeve Binchy, Jeffrey Archer or Iain Pears are listed among your favorite reads, I strongly urge you to give Kate Morton a try.  You won't be disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I found that if I want to sync with my Kindle Amazon, I need to power down and then power up 2 times.  A bit of a hassle but worth the time when I have nothing to do while waiting for appointments or my daughter to get out of gymnastics.
B009FB3XTA|2.0|I have to say that I'm disappointed in this album. It's very Blah, its actually boring.... I hope once I see the movie it will make me like the music more but I doubt it. Part 2 has a lot of action in it and not many of these tunes fit that bill. I like the Ellie Goulding song a lot and the Green Day song, other than those the rest are sub-par.<br /><br />Post Movie viewing Review....... some of the songs fit in this movie just fine, others you don't even notice, after watching it twice I have to add the Christina Perry a thousand years part 2,to the like list. AWESOME MOVIE BTW
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is was the first JG book I've ever read, and let me tell you, I LOVE his style of writing. Is any of it realistic? No. But it's a fictional novel, so it's okay. It's mean to be a bit of an escapist novel, and I love it. My fifteen-year-old self would have drooled over Augustus and mourned the lack of real-life Guses in the world. Brilliant book, and I can't wait to read more.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great drama, acting and story, with unexpected twists and turns every week. Just when you think you've figured it out, wham.

B007SGLZP8|1.0|This was awful...  I don't believe Grisham wrote it  (I am an avid fan of his)  It was \\"BORING\\" and non thrilling...

0316228532|5.0|Although I only read the summary and a few pages of The Casual Vacancy, it is comparable to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and Sleepy Hollow. There are hidden things that are right in front of the eyes, whose owners still fail to see. Barry Fairweather's empty seat is the ignitor for the town's war of social classes, families and learning institutions.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|awesome. I love a good funny zombie movie and this just might be my favorite. must have for any zombie lover's collection.
B003B02O14|5.0|LOVE this book.  I still have a few Grisham novels to read and it was fun to read this one from years ago.  LOVED IT.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|When Adele's title track was released for Skyfall, I loved it. I think it's the best title track in years. I had high hopes that the score would follow suit, and I was very curious to see what Thomas Newman would bring to the table for his first outing as a Bond soundtrack composer.<br /><br />I can only say that the soundtrack in whole is good, but it is not excellent and not quite what I hoped for. I am very much a John Barry fan. Even though Barry could get repetitive in the use of the title track themes woven into his scores, it was just right and added the right poke of excitement to the movie. You knew that Bond was about to fight some bad guys when that theme cue came up. When David Arnold came aboard starting with Tomorrow Never Dies, he really hit the score out of the park. But subsequent Arnold scores seemed less and less appealing and I grew tired of the way that electronic percussion was used. Even though Barry experimented with it (especially in The Living Daylights), something was better about it then; maybe just because it was new and more of a novelty.<br /><br />I measure soundtracks largely on the basis of my likelihood to repeatedly want to listen to them well after purchase. Such classics as The Living Daylights, A View to a Kill, and Tomorrow Never Dies all fall in this category. The last handful of David Arnold soundtracks, not so much, and I suspect Skyfall will also end up collecting dust.<br /><br />This soundtrack continues the trend of heavy use of electronic percussion and drum loops. Sadly, the Skyfall theme is almost nowhere to be found. And there's just not enough of Monty Norman's classic Bond cues for my taste. It is too much of a generic action score and not enough of a Bond score.<br /><br />The best tracks of the lot, in my opinion are:<br /><br />1. Grand Bazaar, Istanbul - Although they've done away (yet again) with the opening Bond gun barrel sequence, this track opens the movie and at least it does so with a couple notes fromthe Bond theme (da-daaa) to let you know this is a BOND movie, and it works for me. The rest is a good action piece with some heroic Bond theme baked in. It's satisfying but not overly so.<br /><br />7. Jellyfish - I like suspenseful pieces and this is a great example. Let's just say that driving in traffic while listening to something like this won't be the same. You'll be ready to handle anything.<br /><br />10. Day Wasted - A somber piece ending in an optimistic glimmer of the Bond theme.<br /><br />11. Quartermaster - Suspense and intrigue.<br /><br />18. Health & Safety - I believe this is referring to the subway sequence where Bond chases after Silva. More great tension and suspense.<br /><br />20. Tennyson - Possibly my favorite. Nice rhythm with violins over top, building up at the end with horns & drums.<br /><br />22. Breadcrumbs - Thank goodness, Monty Norman's classic presentation is revealed and nicely done. But, just as your appetite whets in anticipation as it builds up, it peters out just as quickly and leaves you disappointed.<br /><br />My other pet peeve is that, in the apparent new pattern of Bond soundtrack releases, the title track by Adele is missing. This has become a minor quibble only because it is very easy to buy the single as an MP3, but it is still frustrating. I don't consider the soundtrack complete without the flagship title song.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you collect Bond soundtracks it's a given that you'll add this to your collection. But for casual listeners who want a lot of Bond theme action or expect to hear the Skyfall theme poignantly woven into the score, you may be disappointed. It is just too generic to be a true Bond score. Since James Bond Will Return, maybe next time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautifully written...Easily absorbed into the lives of her characters. I wish every parent and foster parent would read before taking on the responsibilities of child-rearing. A book that forces you to realize how cruelty and unhappiness are symptoms of aberrant parenting and an absence of love.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game!  It's a great way to pass the time, especially if you're waiting for someone or something.  The game is always challenging and entertaining.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Who wouldn't love The Avengers?  It has Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans AND directed by Joss Whedon of Buffy fame as well as Cabin In The Woods.  It's a perfect blend of all the Marvel films and has tons of action not to mention all the great Tony Stark sarcasm.  I don't really care for movies nowadays they are mostly lame and redundant.  But this movie was a shot of adrenaline.  Can't wait to see how or if they work in Spiderman.  As long as Thor and Tony are in any future movies, I'm sure it will be enough for me!
B0058YPILY|5.0|Received Season 7 of Criminal Minds in a timely manner and in good condition.  Can't wait for Season 8 as I will be ordering that as soon as it's available.
B0053O89IS|4.0|This was an excellent season, but fell short for me episodically speaking. There are usually 20 plus episodes and this one fell short at 13 episodes. I hope this isn't going to be practiced in future seasons unless they begin charging less for the seasons that have less episodes. That was the only disappointment as the acting is excellent, thus that is the only reason i gave it 4 stars. The way in which all characters interact is superb. I look forward to season 8.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|[Update 2-1-15] X-Rite has extensively updated their software in the past few years, and I've gone over the features at the bottom of this review. [Update 1/13/17] I had a deterioration issue which was resolved by their amazing customer service, see bottom of review.<br /><br />I've had the Colormunki display for a little over a year now, and figured I should say something about it. It's one of those things that you hesitate to purchase, and once you do becomes one of those invaluable things that works so well you forget about it. I received this as a gift shortly before I purchased the [[ASIN:B005NM8PB6 ASUS PA246Q Monitor]], using it on a Samsung 910T PVA panel. I had just purchased the [[ASIN:B0002LC9TC Epson Expression 10000XL Wide-Format Graphic Arts Scanner]] and [[ASIN:B004IZN3RK Epson Stylus Photo R3000 Wireless Wide-Format Color Inkjet Printer (C11CA86201)]] to reproduce my Wife's artwork. It was time to get serious about color matching.<br /><br />Coming from a design background, I'm used to using calibrated monitors and viewing stations with temperature controlled lighting for offset printing such as packaging. I'm also a cheapskate and for home use have always calibrated my monitors by eye. For most purposes this can work quite well depending on whether or not you have a target to work with. Most people don't need a calibration device, or can't take advantage of one because they're using an inferior monitor. When it comes to spot colors, artwork and photography, it gets a little more critical as far as final output. It's dicey enough to get something to print exactly (or even close to) the way you see it on your monitor. It's even trickier to color match a piece of artwork that you've scanned. Needless to say, the Colormunki worked quite well with the Samsung, but I could also instantly see the monitor wasn't capable of reproducing colors (sometimes near fluorescent) that oil pastels are capable of. Once matched with a fantastic IPS panel, I was set!<br /><br />Now, I've used and seen used many brands of calibration devices, and I believe that both the X-Rite and Spider units are excellent. However, I've had more experience and luck with X-Rite's software, a version of which also happens to come bundled with the Epson Scanner and works quite well. One physical feature I prefer is the form factor compared to the Spyders. The Spyders are like Mice with 3 legs, and in turn sit in little cradles when on the desktop. To me, it's a rather ungainly solution. The Colormunki is quite small, self-contained and sits upright on its own. Nothing to knock over really, and a very small footprint. The diffuser flips over when reading the monitor, and flips back when sitting on the desktop. The Spyder also seems to me to be &#34;directional&#34; when it sits on its cradle, the Colormunki seems to be more omnidirectional as it points straight up.<br /><br />Be aware though that the Colormunki Display is what I would consider the rock-bottom of calibration devices. There are a few things it doesn't do, and for professional use I would definitely spring for one of the better models. For instance, there is no way to read the actual luminance of the monitor, only to set it. For most photographers and designers, this sort of thing is not an issue. Especially if you're in control of the print process. However, if money was on the line, then it would pay to get the higher end device.<br /><br />Another thing that you should look for in a calibration device is the ability to read ambient light and correct for it at intervals. My home office has 2 windows on 2 walls, and the light changes drastically throughout the day. This adjusts for it quite well (set for every 10 minutes) as well as when the sun goes down. I could not recommend a device that cannot compensate in this way. Color correction should always be done in a lit room - ideally in an environment that is close to how the final product will be viewed. This can't always happen, and the colormunki compensates. If you're the type who likes to color correct in a darkened room, then good luck to you is all I can say - because what I'd like to say isn't G rated!<br /><br />I've also been using this on Windows 7 for a year, and recently [[ASIN:B008H3SW4I Windows 8 Pro]]. When I installed Windows 8, it had no issues actually finding the Colormunki drivers and installing them without assistance. Of course, I still needed to install the calibration software and recalibrate to my new graphics card. My old ATI card was causing issues with Adobe CS6. The software itself comes in easy and expert modes, unless you wish to pick a particular color temperature for your lighting situation, I recommend keeping it on easy mode. It does a great job and is fairly quick - the whole process takes about 3-4 minutes. That could be slow if you calibrate often, but I've found once the monitor stabilizes (age-wise) it's not really that necessary to do frequently.<br /><br />Just so you know the calibration software is working, there's a before and after image to compare the difference. I find with my Asus monitor it warms whites up ever so slightly from before. More importantly, I can scan images in (Adobe RGB) and have very little color correction to do. Any color corrections that I do based on the artwork are accurately reflected in the printed material.<br /><br />If you're printing at home and are the sort who likes to experiment and use materials other than papers with ICC profiles, I would recommend looking at the [[ASIN:B00169N0BK ColorMunki Photo - Monitor, Printer & Projector Profiler]] which allows you to calibrate your printer on specific media as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to setup and use<br />- Calibrates for ambient light<br />- Good software<br />- Windows 8 64 bit compatible<br />- Small footprint<br />- Simple design<br />- Decent price<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Still expensive<br />- Software could be better still (get better model)<br />- Software is slow if you need to calibrate often<br />- Dull looking<br /><br />Bottom line, it's one of those things you'll always wonder how you got along without. It's perfect for those who control the creative process in house. Professional photographers and designers will certainly have something to gain from it. It will also get immediately ignored, other than the fact you need to have it in a spot close to your monitor to read the light correctly. It's a conversation starter for people who wonder what the weird little glowing device is sitting on your desk. I give it 5 stars for a good intro price-point and doing what it's supposed to do. It's not fun or romantic, but it gets the job done, and quite well.<br /><br />*** Update 9/21/13 ***<br />Important Notice!<br />I did run into a problem with the device when installing onto a new computer.<br />No, it wasn't windows 8 (already running on old computer).<br />No, it wasn't the drivers (I did try them all at first as I was pulling out my hair).<br />It was the new energy saving PC!<br />Apparently (and this may be common with the new Haswell chip) the USB ports don't have enough &#34;oomph&#34; to power the device.<br />Once I got a powered USB hub the problem was solved.<br /><br />***Update 2/1/15***<br />The software has been updated in the more recent versions.

B0060D3BWK|3.0|It's an OK movie, nothing great, but good enough to entertain the grandkids. It wasn't priced too high, although for an older movie, it was a little more than should be.
B004SCN2F6|2.0|It would be more entertaining if I didn't have to restart the app every five minutes. The customization of the ship is fun, and the \\"background\\" if you will is very thought out. I hope they're able to get it updated and correct the bugs.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Just to establish in everyone's mind that \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is a sequel to the highly-successful 007 reboot \\"Casino Royale,\\" it picks up the action just minutes after the previous film left off.  That strategy seems to have backfired, however, causing viewers to unfavorably compare it to its predecessor.  Bond attempts to uncover the global conspiracy that was responsible for Vesper Lynd's suicide in \\"Royale.\\"  It seems like that premise is innocuous enough... but it isn't.<br /><br />With the release of the third Daniel Craig Bond movie, everyone has piled manure on \\"Quantum.\\"  Craig joined in, saying that \\"Quantum\\" \\"wasn't well-written.\\"  One reviewer in a popular magazine sneered that \\"Quantum\\" \\"suffered from Jason Bourne p---- envy.\\"  In fact, the lackluster response to \\"Quantum,\\" along with MGM's collapse, led to a three year suspension of the franchise; there was some talk that there would never be another Bond film. Was \\"Quantum of Solace\\" that bad?  Other than the cat-with-its-tail-stuck-in-a-fan theme music, courtesy of Alicia Keys, No.<br /><br />The real problem with the film was that it dared to touch a wire that has generally been avoided in Bond films; relevance.  Though they're part of the spy genre, Bond films don't exist in the real world.  They are often adolescent male fantasies about state-funded luxury, beautiful willing women, fast cars and a free-ticket to kill.  In short, don't look for Le Carre plots here.  Sometimes, when the silliness becomes too much - like in a Roger Moore film or in \\"Die Another Day,\\" the franchise dials back to grittiness.  But the filmmakers always carefully avoid making explicit political statements.  \\"Quantum\\" broke that rule: it used a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" plot about a major corporation stealing Bolivia's water supply, and it depicted the Quantum group as a corporate octupus that had infiltrated the world's governments.  It even depicted the ugly moral compromises the U.S. and U.K. were making when resource-hunting in the Third World.  The very use of the name \\"Quantum\\" may have been a dig at mega-financier George Soros, who has an international organization called \\"Quantum.\\"<br /><br />This film is therefore not bad, but it rubs the money people the wrong way.  Moreover, whenever audiences sit down to enjoy escapist fare, only to see a depiction of real-world problems, they often make their displeasure known.  The Broccoli family - makers of the Bond films - were chastened, told never to make a \\"relevant\\" film again.  Duly humbled, they made the popular \\"Skyfall\\" three years later.  Hooray, and free lobotomies for all.e-hunting in the Third World.

B001KQIRGW|5.0|and better now with the remastering and constant access from my smartphone, very much enjoyed listening to Time Table again this morning, hadn't heard it in years, a minor track but still so very clever in its construction and message
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Almost all the music I have at home lies in the pop category.  I've always had an eclectic taste and chosen music that appealed to me.  I've had my favorite artists and groups over the years just like most people.  But, no artist has ever affected me like Susan Boyle.  That being said, I'm not fond of musicals and do not purchase this type of music.  This album was going to be a stretch for me.<br /><br />HAVE I EVER BEEN SOUNDLY GIVEN A LESSON!  I do have an appreciation for a beautiful voice as well as wonderful orchestration.  Susan's magnificent voice is front and center throughout each song in this album and the orchestration does not detract, but enhances throughout.  An occasional choir only gives the listener chills at the right moment.  Susan's new producer, Biff Stannard, seemed to know when to let a song center on just Susan's voice and then build on it.  They are a great team.<br /><br />Pop girl didn't have one song she didn't like.  Somewhere Over the Rainbow was my favorite until I decided they were all my favorite.  I have not thought about Donny Osmond in years, but that guy can sing!  The two duets with Donny are wonderful, and I am a new fan!  And, I think I have fallen in love with Michael Crawford too.  I dearly loved the intimate, seductive quality of Music of the Night.  I could almost see the seduction taking place, and wasn't sure I was supposed to be there.  What a masterful duet!  Bring Him Home! -- Wow!  Really stark brginning with just Susan's voice and gradually building -- beautiful.  I was driving when I heard As Long As He Needs Me for the first time, and my jaw dropped.  I realized I was going 80mph!  Awesome!  Out Here On My Own could be a single it's so good -- bluesy/jazzy -- smokin' voice -- really wonderful!  I positively could NOT pick a favorite song they are all so good.<br /><br />So....from someone who is NOT a fan of musicals and really thought she would not like show tunes, I can say Boy Was I Wrong!!!  The songs are from musicals spanning many years and they made some excellent choices.  This album shouldn't be missed.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|Great series with characters you will really enjoy.  More background on the world would be good, so I'm hoping future books will reveal more.  Wouldn't miss the modern American left-ish \\"Love is gender blind\\" aspects.  But they don't detract from the story or your enjoyment of those characters.<br /><br />So buy and read the whole series.  You won't regret it, I promise.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The graphics is amazing,surround very good whit the home theater system or headset whit surround but the history is not so good if you feel like these day don't have nothing to watch these movies is good for past the  time whit you girlfriend or friends,the collector edition is good and the design very good but is was me don't buy whit the digital copy because don't work and i buy this movie and ultraviolet suck's...if you want this movie only the bluray save your money.

B009E2WX3W|4.0|This is a very decent CD, has so many of the old songs I grew up with, listening to it reminds me of my younger years, and be grateful they are behind me now.
B003PJ6UHA|2.0|Nothing wrong with this except for its self-indulgent, self-congratulatory, autobiographical meanderings, used in large part to stretch what should be a long article into a \\"book.\\"<br /><br />The endless repetition and digression is tiresome and lame. Nonetheless, the chapters on the double-slit experiment and particle entanglements are well done. Much of the rest is filler.
B009H2PCNC|5.0|As much as I enjoy the recent diversity of Eno's output, he is back to his bread and butter with \\"Lux.\\" For well over a decade - as both \\"Most Played\\" and threadbare disc surface will attest- Eno's ambient \\"Thursday Afternoon\\" masterpiece has been a source of inspiration for me, a sort of soundtrack to my life. After giving Lux a turn, I can tell instantly that this work is bound to cast a similar spell. These 4, technically seperate tracks, actually comprise a whole. Deeply layered, subtle and at times haunting, There seems to be endless possibilities to explore here.  I havent read any of the album credits (downloaded only the mp3 version so far), but it sounds as if Harold Budd or Harold Budd-esque piano work meanders through the work. Along with \\"Thursday Afternoon,\\" my other favorite ambient album is the beautiful Budd & Eno, \\"The Pearl\\"; A haunting piece that uses heavy doses of acoustic piano, blending perfectly over Eno's meandering sonic scapes. Equally so here on \\"Lux\\"  While written for a specific art installation, (as have so many of Eno's recent compositions) This work would seem to transcend a soundscape for a singular, particular piece of art. It has the quality-like all truly brilliant ambient pieces- to provide living music, useful in just about any and all situations throught the day. Sorry for rambling, but I just gave the album another spin and couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you Brian.
B005HSL626|5.0|i got the kindle for myself, but i think my kids get more mileage out of it than i do, and it started w/ fruit ninja--a really fun game.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|What more can I say about this soundtrack, as all the songs on this CD are truly wonderful and Carter Burwell is at his best! Was not a soundtrack person until a friend of mine got me hooked onto these CD's. Well, and now I am a Twi-hard! Can't wait for the Breaking Dawn II to come out! Purchased this CD on Amazon.

B007NR9WBG|5.0|I first saw this movie on German TV in the 80s. I loved it for its thrilling story, the great actors, especially Walken, whom I adore. And of course for the (at the time) advanced graphic sfx. I owned it on VHS once. But for a long time I've been hoping for a real good HD disc(which by the way still isn´t available in Germany).<br /><br />Now this region free Blu Ray has made my dream come true. An amazingly great quality in sharpness and colour brilliance, let alone the fantastic audio track. Unbelievable for a movie of that age.<br /><br />Luckily I'm good in English language, as there is no German audio. This encluded it would really be making my day.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is a great resource. It covers everything I wanted to know about building muscle. I see reviews saying that you can get all of this information off of the internet. Well maybe, but I don't have time for that. I need to have it all in one place.<br /><br />I have been working out for years now and learned a lot from this book. Mike is also happy to answer questions via email, which I think is great!

B0090EHVMC|2.0|The rental was too short to enjoy with my kids taking a nap every four hours.  My three year old didn't get to finish the movie coz it was past her bedtime, by the time it was okay for her to watch again, the 24 hours has passed.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely loved these books. Couldn't put them down and want to read them again. Excellent story line and such emotion. Definitely recommend.
0060760273|5.0|A great bedtime story to read to a child to put the child to bed with love and reassurance.  A tale of warmth and security.

0307120007|5.0|A classic story in a great package with a soft bunny toy.  A wonderful book for a small child to introduce them to the joy of reading.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|A good followup to the first book in the series.  It ties many things together but leave some unanswered for the next book, which I have started.  I have avoided newer scifi writer for years prefering the old standards I read 50 years ago.  I am very glad to find such and dedicated new author in Card.  I will be reading more of this book.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author. I had not read anything by Oscar Wilde until this book and it is a good read.[[ASIN:B0084AXZK0 The Picture of Dorian Gray]]
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is more like the best books of John Grisham!  Great mystery, good character development, interesting story.  Really enjoyed the adventure!
B008476HBM|5.0|[[ASIN:B008476HBM Pride and Prejudice]] Love Jane Austen  Have seen the movie many times and read the book so much more exciting to read the book and let your mind visualize the settings.  If you like Jane Austen the you will enjoy this book
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|The series was as compelling as this movie. Great writing and directing. If only they had continued on with the T.V. series.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Ken Follet has done some awesome research on his topic and then wrapped it around the lives of real people that you as the reader get to know, understand and empathise with or hate - whichever is relevant to that character.<br /><br />Although the book in physical sense is a really daunting size it is easy to get into and read.  You are held captive chapter by chapter with a strong desire to put of going to work, cooking dinner or any other necessary function so that you can reach the end of the book.<br /><br />I would recommmend this book without hesitation.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I have had more fun reading the reviews of Fifty Shades of Grey than I had reading the book. They are all far more entertaining. I initially purchased this book as a Kindle sample out of curiosity since everyone else seemed to be reading it. I deleted it quite soon afterwards having decided that life is too short to waste on such drivel. Then finally I decided that if I was going to be able to join in conversations about this book without feeling like a complete fraud, I had better download the whole thing and knuckle down to it. But boy is it tedious, if I ever read \\"oh my\\" again I think I will scream and the idea that Ana can be so shy and retiring and blush and  whisper her way through the book but then drop earth shattering orgasms at the drop of a pin, is just too ridiculous and unbelievable for words. Christian's character is equally contrived; why would someone with such specific sexual appetites pick out a 20 year old naive school girl ( I think Ana was really 14 not 20). Aside from a totally flawed character development, the book has a boring plot and against my best principles, I ended up skipping through big sections- seriously does the author expect you to enjoy reading pages and pages of legal contract!! The best part of the book is when she walks out on Christian at the end and I could get back to something more enjoyable.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Have purchased the 10000mAh model from amazon in the past and very much liked it.  When my wife wanted something similar this model (the 8400mAh) model stood out as perhaps a bit more portable, certainly cheaper, and maybe a bit more usable.  It supports charging 2 devices at once.  The big differentiator however is that it can be charged via USB instead of a dedicated charger / brick.  It is not quite as big in terms of energy storage but this unit is smaller, and rounded corners make it nicer to look at.  Very good unit.  From our experience the Anker units are all very nice, pick your size and number of outputs as well as input style (usb or dedicated charger).
B009KHCT94|4.0|Iron Sky is a classic. Escaped from the fall of 1945 they colonize the dark side of the moon and spend 70 years mining Helium 3, a fusion super fuel. Their plans for conquering the earth solidify when a stray American moon landing puts them in possession of a cell phone \\"computer\\" capable of controlling their super weapon. \\"There's an app for that Mein Herr\\" The fun starts when they turn the surviving Afro-American astronaut into a prototypical albino-aryan (albeit thick lips and all) then send him with a scout team to the earth to get more cell phones. Meanwhile the president, a surprisingly dead on Sarah Palin knockoff see's the invading Nazis as saviors of her reelection. \\"Moon Nazis? They're real Nazi's?? Ohhh, my reelection's saved!!\\" Yes, it gets out of hand.<br /><br />The UN Security Council scenes are priceless. Watch how the North Koreans try to take credit for the mysterious Moon Nazi incursions.<br /><br />Except for the special effects (as good as any sci-fi flick) calling this a B flick would be a blatant compliment. The acting is porn grade, like they corralled a bunch of porn actors on the cheap during their lunch break to make this film. Its simple, film the Iron Sky footage in the Nazi costumes, cut the scene, leave the cameras rolling for porn footage as they change costumes for the next Iron Sky scene. Rather gives new meaning to the term 'double feature'.<br />Put this DVD on the shelf labeled \\"Movies to watch stoned\\"
B004GYY714|5.0|Great Kindle App for radio listening. Am able to listen stations in my area that are just out of FM and fade in and out. Glad I found it.
0345803485|4.0|While I think that some of the past reviews must have bought into the hype about improving their sex lives, etc., I must agree that the first book of the trilogy didn't really live up to the hype.  I personally didn't find anything that far off the charts as far as the sexual aspects go.  I think perhaps the author was trying to be sensitive to the heroine's naivety which unfortunate came out a bit sophomoric.  However, as I read the two other volumes, I was quite taken with the story line.  To me, it actually seemed to be quite the love story.  Indiviually, each book would probably not measure up to a good read.  Together, not so bad.
B0073XORLU|3.0|Didn't expect too much when I purchased this, but as a long-time (30+ years) Jethro Tull fan I really didn't feel I had a choice!  I have all of IA's solo stuff and this sounds a lot like those, especially \\"Rupi's Dance\\" which is an excellent CD.  IA's voice has never been what it was in the 70's and although he tries to change it (electronically) on occasion on TAAB2, don't expect the original Tull vocals you've come to know and love.  Not many great melodies here, but as expected from the wizardry of IA, the production is superb and the instrumentation is of top quality.  My own personal wish is that IA would take a short break (like Neil Young) and pen an autobiography.  He is supremely literate and obviously intelligent and would have no problem writing text.  In fact, the words on TAAB2 are quite good and interesting.  Don't expect more than a few echoes of the original \\"Thick As a Brick\\" on TAAB2, however, the music is original and typical IA, post-Tull.  Mostly to be enjoyed by the true Jethro Tull fan, especially the one who doesn't mind Tull's 1990s (and IA's solo) efforts...
B001JIHGO0|4.0|The video and sound quality was good. The film did stop a few times, but it wasn't too bothersome. I have had pretty good success with amazon downloads.
B007MAETA8|4.0|I've never been a huge fan of John Mayer, but I have always appreciated his excellent guitar work and have been impressed with some of his earlier song-writing.  This CD represents a slightly new direction for Mayer, which is a good sign that he is willing to change/grow as an artist, rather than be stuck in some rigid, carefully-defined style (like some artists appear to be).  If you like acoustic, melody-driven, easy-listening music in the style of Neil Young, Wilco, America, etc., then you will enjoy this collection.  A few songs sound like others (one recalls an Allman Brothers tune, while another employs the identical riff from Bob Segers \\"Down on Main Street\\"), but in general these are great originals.  Although some may have been turned off from Mayer by his earlier, bad-boy doings, he seems genuinely repentant in a few cases and ready to get back to the music.  Its worth giving him that chance...
B008ER9QKG|5.0|A huge treat to watch these DVD's and it was quite nice to get the extra DVD (Wagner's Dream) that showed  the effort required to make this production with its spectacular new set.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Film directors should avoid all temptation and stop making prequels.  Star Wars Episode 1-3 were lackluster and Prometheus is even worse.  Were you really spending the past three decades wondering about the Engineer and where the Aliens came from?  It's here, but you could have been told in 10 minutes.  The script is deadly dull and I didn't really care about any of the characters.  Compare that to the original Alien where I liked the entire crew and hated to see them get picked off.  I was so bored in the final scenes I fell asleep.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|This is one of those classic books that I don't recall ever having read. There is great attention to detail and the characters are well developed although I did find at times that it was a bit too drawn out. I was grateful for being able to look up many of the old words words easily on the Kindle, and am glad that I finally got around to reading this pirate classic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series really keeps you in the book. Love love love it. Can't wait for more. Thank you again .
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the read but at times, felt a little bit in left field.  Maybe because my mind doesn't<br />work that way.  I especially enjoyed the main character who seemed brighter than the average bear.<br />Learned a lot about how the FBI, DEA, CIA, operate and how much tax payer money it takes to track down a crook.  Felt compassion and concern about other people in the story who had little chance to follow a straight path without being corrupted by someone who used them for their own benefit.<br />Still, I would recommend another Grisham book to anyone who likes a mystery.  My 86 year old cousin, a retired school principal and coach in Kingston, Ca., told me he couldn't put it down.  This recommendation from someone I admire and trust, prompted me to order the Racketeer for my kindle.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Jellyflop! is a very fun and creative game.  I love it, my kids love it.  It's cute and whimsical.  Highly recommended.

B009HV2JT8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It takes the history lessons you might remember from elementry school and puts a fun fantasy spin on them. Don't expect to earn a degree in American History from watching this, but if you let yourself relax and get into the alternate-personality spin presented here, chances are you'll enjoy this film.
0061692042|5.0|For a moment, suppose your mom and pop decided to rob a bank to get their share of the American Dream? Maybe  they'd be doing it for you. Maybe they took the idea of redistribution of wealth a bit further than was wise. Whatever, that is how this book begins--and I have disclosed nothing of what reviewers and the dust jacket tell you. That is what Ford starts with and after that he will amaze you with insights, plot, and language. This is a must read.
B00814NM02|5.0|Excelent product! the steelbook is a Master Piece. The movie is very good like the visual effect and the actors.

It reminds me of a modern Logan's Run only much much better!<br /><br />If you haven't read this book then you should really read it now, don't miss out on this amazing and exciting story!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|great characters, great actors, positive messages about life and choices. watched it with my 24 yo who also really enjoyed it.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I ENJOY DISNEY MOVIES ESPECIALLY IF THE KIDS GET INTO THE MOVIE AND YOU FIND THEM LAUGHING WHEN THEY LAUGH IM HAPPY, ITS REALLY A GOOD MOVIE ITS WORTH WATCHING. I RENTED IT FROM AMAZON SO THAT IF THE KIDS DIDNT LIKE IT I  WOULDN'T HAVE TO WASTE MY MONEY ON BUYING IT ON BLURAY, BUT WE ALL LAUGHED SO IM BUYING THE MOVIE RIGHT AFTER THE REVIEW IM WRITING.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE IF YOU WANT TO BUY THE MOVIE RENT IT FROM AMAZON THEN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF THATS WHAT I DID AND I LIKE IT SO NOW IM BUYING IT :-)
0345803485|1.0|Come on, be honest, you know why you want to read this book, right?  You're not looking for stellar writing or realistic characters or even a believable plot--you're searching for the big O.  Problem is, the most satisfying experiences, be they between the pages or the sheets, come from a skillful and passionate build-up.  Fifty Shades just doesn't have the right touch.<br /><br />Like an unskilled lover, this book is all sweaty palms groping for shock value.  It ignores the subtleties of erotica.  It unloads on you before the tension reaches it's peak, often setting up a hot scene but knocking it down before all the pieces are in place.<br /><br />And after it fails to deliver a few times, it's other faults start to stand out like a bad case of VD.  Like the fact that Ana, our American protagonist, sounds suspiciously British (just like EL James, who incidentally lives across the pond).  Or the fact that the only thoughts Ana is capable of having in the heat of passion are: 'holy crap' (used 41 times in one book) and 'oh my' (used a staggering 73 times). Or the fact that Ana is a 21-year-old virgin who had never once--NOT ONCE!!--thought about boys (or girls, or anyone) in 'that way'.  And when her loins do finally awaken, it's to her pony-tail being yanked back in an elevator scene that's been overdone since Aerosmith sang about it in the 80's.<br /><br />It's frightening to think there are women out there modeling their romantic lives after this book--yeah ladies, it'll give you an O-face, alright--as in OMG how did this become a bestseller?
1607066017|5.0|Brian Vaughan is one work wonder, entering his mind might probably be like entering the world of Saga. It's packed with a real unique plot, which is great, since science fiction manga, comic, or stories itself are recycled every time. So it's refreshing to be able to read something fresh and unboring.<br /><br />The illustrator, Fiona Staples, is probably the best creative artist out there. She draws movement, action, and emotions very brightly and always at present that her art looks alive, especially with a story in it. I like what she does with the Robot Prince IV, that even a guy with a blank screen as a face, you just can't stop imagining his emotions because of the body gestures and so. (I'm probably also infatuated with the Prince, OK. But Marko is one sext mother-f)<br /><br />Anyway.....over all. It's a really refreshing graphic novel. A must read!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I think some people under rated this game!concrete software, Inc did a brilliant job on this game!I only rate things if its good or bad so basicly 1star or 5 star and I think this is a five star game!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've been a Follet fan since \\"Eye of the Needle\\".  I enjoy his style, even if the tomes are ponderous! I'm never disappointed..
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I have been reading bookds by Ken Follett since his first novel came out and have always anticipated a good read when I saw his name.  In my experience most of his books have been well written novels which provide delightful recreational reading. I looked forward to the publication of \\"Winter of the World\\" and I ordered it on Kindle as soon as it was available. I faithfully plowed through about a fouth of it, thinking all the while that it would get better.  As I did, I couldn't shake a strange sense that the book had been written by someone who borrowed Ken Folletts name. What happened to the rich characters which made me feel like I cared about these people?  What happened to the enjoyable flow of words that kept me interested regardless of the subject matter?  What happened to well developed story lines? I was left kicking myself that I had wasted as much time and money on this book as I had, in that it delivers only mind-numbing boredom. Any author can produce a clinker now and then, and I am hopeful that this was the case in \\"Winter of the World\\". I hope even more that his identity hasn't been stolen, or that it isn't the winter of Mr. Folletts literary career, because that would be a shame. Maybe this book got better as it went along, but I will never know!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|These cases are fake! I ordered one thinking it was a great deal but you really do get what you pay for. As soon as I installed it on my phone I was unable to hear who I was talking to and they were unable to hear me. I contacted the actual Lifeproof company for support and after they checked the serial numbers they let me know that this case is a fake. Do not waste your time trying with this \\"great deal\\" case. I have already contacted Amazon.com and they are processing a full refund for this counterfeit case.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I hate long reviews so I will make this short and to the point, as reviews should be.  (Why do review writers think we want them to tell us the entire story?)  This is the bottom line, if you like John Grisham, you will NOT be disappointed!  If you liked \\"The Firm\\" you will NOT be disappointed!  Read and enjoy as I did.  You will not be able to put the book down once you get started.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Flawless performance and great visuals! I love the 'torn paper skin'. So fun and functional. Worth every penny. So glad I got it.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Rented Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol [HD] and downloaded and watched on a 55\\" TV.  It was a good movie and we watched it twice.  I just wish it was in letter box style.  I have a 55\\" TV and I want the movie to use the whole screen.
0385535147|2.0|I've read all of Grisham's books and enjoyed them immensely.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was disappointed by The Racketeer.<br /><br />The writing style seemed different than typical Grisham. I realized that there was likely a (nearly uncredited) Ghostwriter or a collaborator whose voice was obvious in the work.<br /><br />Typically, I enjoy the flawed, realistic characters in Grisham's work as they make the story more believable.<br /><br />The Rackteer is not this type of story. Instead, the protagonist and his crew are all one-dimensional, predictable, Mary Sue characters who have few problems while attempting to achieve their goals.<br /><br />Incidentally, the entire \\"winning team\\" are African American and everyone they outsmart, shaft or anyone who \\"loses\\" in the story...is Caucasian.<br /><br />The combination of the Mary Sue characters and race constantly being mentioned is the modus operandi of Walter Mosley. Mosley is mentioned twice in the story as the Character reads Mosley paperbacks. Coincidence? Not likely.<br /><br />Not the best from Grisham.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|this was a great read, I couldnt put it down and looked forward to reading it each night! dramatic, suspenseful, and kept you thinking! would highly recommend !
B0024396WE|1.0|This copy is low quality for a Bluray. I own a copy of this movie on DVD and the this bluray does not offer any improvement in picture quality and is grainy, its possibly a bootleg. Some of the detail is lost or fuzzy, similar to how a DVD player will upconvert a DVD to view on HD TVs. Quality Blurays will usually read and play at 1080p/24hz, this one plays at 1080p/60hz; which is poorer quallity. Additionally, the Bluray player played it right away just like it was a DVD; Blurays usually take a bit longer to read at first. All the above comments are about the quality of this Bluray, not the movie itself. The movie is excellent. I believe this is a Canadian import, if it is released in the U.S. I will possibly purchase.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|I want my money and time back.  Well time more then money for watching this train wreck! Well i guess it wouldn't be all bad if you were a 12 year old boy with hormone issues.  Otherwise its just a waste. I bet we could have rebuilt a couple of bridges or funded a solar plant with the money thrown down the toilet on this cultural abomination.

B001PJRAUS|2.0|Horrible, horible, horrible, Bad acting, bad Mr, Darcy, and an insult to other films, like those starring Colin Firth, and Sir Lawrence Oilvier, in Pride and Prejusidce, one big farce unappreciated by this viewer.<br />An insult to MIss Jane Austen the author of Pride and Prejudice and other classic novels.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Episode 2 - Sick, was a great episode. Can't wait for the rest of Season 3 to unfold! Walking Dead - making zombies a reality. :)
B009AZZEU2|3.0|When I heard the Avengers soundtrack I thought Soundgarden lost their edge. For all Cornell's creativity on the solo scene, I found him leaning towards the softer side of life - they certainly aren't capable of Badmotorfinger-level bludgeoning anymore. Then a couple of clips came out from King Animal. I wasn't sure if I was impressed or anxious.<br /><br />It is nowhere as dark or powerful as Superunknown, nor is it as catchy and creative as Down on the Upside. It does however, contain minor elements of both those records. There is also a distinct country or blues feel to this album that places it almost close to Black Country Communion than Soundgarden of old. Why this is by no means a 'bad record', there simply isn't a great impact in it. It doesn't entertain me, and being a huge Soundgarden fan, it hurts to say that. Would I buy this album regardless? YES. Would I like it for the sake of it being Soundgarden? Well, maybe no. It is a finely crafted album but it just doesn't appeal to me the same way their old stuff does.<br /><br />Track breakdown:<br />That the album started with almost commercial soft rock effort 'I've Been Away Too Long', told me a little bit about what this album would be. A punchy happy rock song is what it comes across as, and so far we're still in 'Avengers soundtrack' territory here. 2/5.<br /><br />Non-State Actor redeems itself from the opener which sounds almost classic Soundgarden but a little bit over-produced and 'nice' chorus. 4/5.<br /><br />Crooked Steps is far more fresh and shows Soundgarden is still up to pace - till you hear the rest of the album. It has an almost Audioslave freshness and modernness to it. Cornell's vocal chords strain through the pre chorus section adding a bit of character. Perhaps one of the better Soundgarden songs overall. 5/5.<br /><br />A Thousand Days Before is where the slight bluesy and country enters but the song is not all that memorable. Not bad, a smooth rocker it is. There is a nice sitar strumming in the background, with a slight Eastern flair throughout the track, which I appreciate as a nice additional touch. 3.5/5.<br /><br />Blood on the Valley Floor comes in at 'Fell on Black Days' pace, but sounds a little more tired than moody. A depressive song that didn't quite succeed in being dark? I just imagine that if it were played at a live show, people would go quiet and wait for this one to finish. The later part of the song is reminiscent of a real Soundgarden song, but it's ultimately forgettable. 2.5/5.<br /><br />Bones of Birds is a similarly slow paced song but with more promise than the one before. A slightly more memorable flow and chorus. This is probably what a current day Soundgarden dirge should sound like. 4/5.<br /><br />Taree is a good rock song, a bit 'country', I was a little surprised to hear this but it's not bad. Again, it's not great either, just good. 3/5.<br /><br />Attrition is forgettable filler. Soundgarden shouldn't have included this shocker on their first album after 16 years. It's meant to be a fast-paced rock'n'rollin tune but you don't buy a Soundgarden album to hear this stuff. 1/5.<br /><br />'Black Saturday' is another interesting soft song, with a nice singing style from Cornell. There's a trumpet in here somewhere, with a cool guitar twang section one-third into the song. This is a great song, but after several soft songs, the listener is at a point where some energy really needs to be injected. Should perhaps be higher up the tracklist. 4/5.<br /><br />'Halfway There' is another forgettable song. Perhaps it sounds like it came off Revelations by Audioslave. It's just a standard rock song, Avengers soundtrack style stuff happening here. 1/5.<br /><br />'Worse Dreams', like 'Crooked Steps' provides one of the albums more interesting moments, perhaps the best song on the album. You can't headbang to this, I'm not sure you can dance to it, but it has a smooth jazz-inspired groove to it before the loud chorus kicks in, \\"like a dog\\"... and when Cornell yells those words, you know it's classic Soundgarden stuff here. 5/5.<br /><br />'Eyelid's Mouth' had potential but is a song that annoys me slightly for the chorus. The lazy chorus is just not something I find enjoyable. 1/5.<br /><br />Rowing is a good soft song. A real 'progression' for Soundgarden. Unfortunately the subject matter \\"Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing\\"... is pretty descriptive for Soundgarden at the moment. 5/5.<br /><br />The bonus tracks here are not worth mentioning because they are simply demo's of the album tracks.<br /><br />I did see some reviews saying this topped Down on the Upside, but in all honesty I think if those same people heard both albums back to back, DotU would be the undoubted winner. King Animal is a soft rock bluesy album with elements of the old Soundgarden. Perhaps softer than Audioslaves last album and the softest Soundgarden album to date. Good rock album however dissapppointing, unfortunately. A few great Soundgarden songs are let down by the surrounding average ones. Anyone kidding themselves that this is a great album needs to look past the nostalgia factor. I love this band, but Soundgarden's weakest album. 3 stars.
B009KYXEY6|3.0|If this deluxe edition came with all the songs it promised, then I would be raving about wonderful ALL the songs are.  But this CD is missing three tracks!  I already own the standard edition of Born To Die and I really like it a lot.  The only reason I bought the entire deluxe edition and not just the separate Paradise EP was because I wanted the three deluxe songs from Born To Die, along with the other eight new songs.  I really hope this can be fixed somehow.  I'm sure this is all some big mistake that no one saw coming.<br /><br />I give this three stars because even though the three missing tracks is a large negative for me, the music is really great.  I would not recommend people buy this however.  I wouldn't have bought it had I known it was going to be incomplete.  I would have bought Paradise separate and then acquired the other three tracks some other way.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent book!! I couldn't put it down. It was definitely a little long, but that's because I wanted to see what would happen next! If you haven't read all 3 books, do so now...you'll be glad you did.

B008QE9XD2|1.0|Let me declare that I am a big fan of Burton, Depp, and the original series. Furthermore I was \\"down\\" for a campy salute to the original and was fully aware it would be \\"different\\". But this movie fails as entertainment on every level because it is a mess...its characters, its plot, its make-up, its special effects, its humor(or lack thereof) and I dare say its music (yes I lived through the seventies I recall fondly many tunes from the era but many from this film should have been trimmed).<br />Perhaps saddest part of all is: this disaster of a movie will likely sink forever the possibility of a \\"true\\" Dark Shadows picture...for fans of the old series (I rushed home every day from school to watch!) that is truly tragic.<br />So take heed, don't be stubborn like I was, read the other negative reviews and turn away in horror lest you fill your shopping cart with crap!!!(and save your money)
B004D1AIZ4|5.0|What can you say about this that hasn't already been said.<br />Every time I watch this film I see something different, something<br />I didn't notice before, a gesture, a look, the light, the dynamic of<br />the way in which the samurai code is shown to us is brilliant.<br />I have watched this movie well over 10 times and will watch it again<br />and again.
B000U27BLO|3.0|The history of philosophy is nicely handled.  It's been decades since we've enjoyed a solid treatment of the history of philosophy that is attractive to the general public.  I've encountered quite a number of people who have become intrigued by philosophy as a result of their encounter with this work.  The fiction that stitched all the philosophy together was competent but not beguiling.

B0067LY4WG|4.0|this is the first Leonard  Cohen cd I have bought.  I am not dissapointed.  In particular \\"Going Home\\", and \\"Show Me The Place\\" are examples of great songwriting and creativity.  I found all of the songs here excellent.  Even though many of the songs deal with sadness and heaviness I found the cd uplifting.  The female singers added a lot.  That is a huge understatement.  I wanted Leonard to have a stronger voice.  But even with that complaint this is still a wonderful cd.

This disc captures the spirit of the Show completely. Frampton is a great guitarist, and a wonderful guy. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Typical John Corey smart-mouth but this time in Yemen. Plods along at times but mostly a good read. I got the feeling that DeMille just wanted to end this book (maybe he got tired of writing) as the climatic encounter was very short. Sets up for the next book.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This album fits perfectly in the Soundgarden library.  If you are a fan of Down on the Upside and Superunknown, then this will not disappoint.  It is shorter than previous SG albums, but it's worth is proven in every second of each song.
0307592731|2.0|Spoiler alert!! This is a very popular book and I can understand why from the perspective that Cheryl Strayed is a gifted storyteller.  The author has experienced a lot of turmoil, loss, and despair in her life.  I can understand how making this \\"journey\\" was soul defining for her.  And she describes this with enviable skill and poignancy.  HOWEVER, halfway through the book she describes the horrific details of how she chose to \\"dispose\\" of her deceased mother's beloved elderly horse.  There are more than two ways to dispose of these magnificent animals; the expensive way (which she could not afford) and the barbaric, and inhumane way, which is the one she chose.  Had she put forth some effort, she could have found an alternative that would have honored her mother's love for this animal and how important this mare had been to her mother through some extremely difficult times.  At this moment, Cheryl Strayed went from a protagonist that I could empathize with to one who just seems self absorbed.  The book has been deleted from my Kindle, unfinished.  I am no longer committed to knowing how Cheryl Strayed survived and thrived.  The precept of this book was how she struggled and ultimately survived the loss of her mother.  As a life long horse lover, I just could not get past this.  She did not honor her mother's memory with this cruel and unnecessary act.  Perhaps other readers will see beyond this.  I simply could not.

B00A135YUW|5.0|I just got this today and I love it. 'Blue Velvet' is my least favorite song and it is also the only song on the album that she didn't write or co-write.<br />The lyrics are dark and haunting just like her vocals, I have never heard such an unique voice. 'Ride' 'American' and 'Gods & Monsters' are AWESOME! I would have bought the album for just those 3 songs. If you haven't already got it, her first album is 'Born to Die' and it is fantastic, too.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Keep an open mind when you read this and realize that each person has their own unique experience because they are different people.
B009H442DG|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Christmas albums but it is nice to have one or two to play each season. This one by Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta, plus some other big names, is the perfect one for this year. Traditional tunes plus a new one by John Farrar and the fact that buying this one you help two good charities make to have it a must. The music is nice, the voices are great, the arrangements are really good. Nothing in this album pretends to be more that what it is, a warm and friendly Christmas album.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Adorable and funny with a awesome story line! I fell in love and plan on watching over and over again!
0810993139|5.0|My son loves this book. He is not even half way through and he is already asking for the next books in line. It is nice that we can sit and read together and it is something we both can enjoy.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A fun story of good guys vs. corporate evil in both the real and virtual world.  All of the references to \\"old\\" games, music, television and movies of the 70's - present was a nice walk down memory lane.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer was such a great story. It was well written, and so exciting. Just when I thought I had the story figured out, it would take another turn. The story was so full of twists and turns. John Grisham hit a home run with this one!!! I look forward to his next book.
030758836X|1.0|I wanted to read this book because it is getting a lot of good press and supposedly will have a movie made.  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in the book.  I felt the writing was immature, the storyline weak, and I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters.  It might be better as a movie.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great game!  No issues at all. Fun levels, some challenge, but not as difficult as ab space.  Thats all I got
B00992CF6W|5.0|Everyone should get this app it is the best and by the way people who cant download this just get it fir the x box or computer and stop whining about it is so anoying
B007SGLZP8|4.0|One of the best John Grisham I've read in a long time.  From page one, it has held my interest.

B000KIPT30|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3IFAKRJDR8ITG]]Bottom line: Poor Audio Quality for Recording<br /><br />I bought this to plug into my mixer board or USB audio interface headphone jack. I'm podcasting and normally do interviews, thus I need more than one pair of headphones for monitoring purposes.<br /><br />I tried this device with a handful of sources, through this device they sound worse. I would compare the quality to 16bit @ 16,000Hz.<br /><br />It's okay for listening to music out in the shop but not nearly good enough for recording.<br /><br />Even though I am returning this item, it has some PROS: Unbeatable price, feels well built, and would be great for non-recording scenarios.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I am so glad I got it I saw the game and just keep going but today I finally tried it and now I canister stop
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headphones are great, they are well constructed and sturdy. The sound is great and they are really comfortable. It's too bad the whole experience is ruined by the fact that they keep disconnecting and reconnecting while in use. So you're watching a movie, or playing a game and all od a sudden the sound cuts out with a few beeps. Then the sound come back after about 5-10 seconds. Then sometimes the headphones will just shut off for no reason, battery level is fine they just turn off. For the price these headphones seem like a decent deal, but don't buy them because you will regret it.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I loved this series and couldn't resist the price.  I know that this has nothing to do with the product but the case was broken at some point and the DVDs were floating about.  None of them were scratched and I've made do.  But what a great show!
1401233791|5.0|You probably already know what this is if you're on here searching for it.  Simply put, its a Batman classic that should be in everyone's library.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I play it when I am on a long car drive or just have nothing to do. All my friends have it and we all try to beat each other! &hearts; it!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs should be required reading for everyone in senior management. The last third in particular gives incredible insight into how Apple's current brand identity was built through Jobs' single-minded passion and commitment to his vision, and the amount of consistency required in every area of life to realize that vision.<br /><br />I would have liked to see a little more of Jobs' own words, especially given that much of this content came from direct interviews with Jobs himself, but the author does give a good feel for the man and his approach to building the Apple brand to what it is today.<br /><br />Some of the personal details became a bit tiring and predictable. Once you understand where Jobs was coming from, you can easily understand why he did some of the things he did so I didn't feel there was a need to rehash or point to these shortcomings -- we all have them.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent look at the life of history's greatest branding genius, and an inspiring read for those who want to grow their company or are tasked with helping to grow other brands.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Kristen Stewart was beautiful but vapid.  Her role is a victim running around wide eyed and panicky.  Suddenly, at the end of the movie she is a warrior with a sword.  You have to wonder how she learned to use one since she had been confined to prison by Theron since she was a little girl.  It didn't make sense.  Charlize Theron was more fun to watch though the role was not very complex.  She seemed to do a lot of screaming.  The relationship between the huntsman and Kristen was not well done at all.  The only thing that saved the movie from being really bad was it was visually stunning --some of the special effects were great and the costumes were good.
B009D7CP2M|1.0|This book was disturbing on every level.  Really horrifying and no redemption.  I finished it and texted my book club to say 'do not read!\\"<br />At times it felt like a \\"how to\\" book for really sick teenagers.  How to ruin your parents, sister and community.  Horribly disturbed story and no satisfying resolution.  It was a chronicle of ruined lives.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I could play this game for hours! mentally stimulating and fun! plus the colors are pretty :) what more could you want in a game!?!?!
B009FBX5M0|1.0|IMHO this is a major ripoff. Really only bought it for the theme song by Adele, expecting to like the rest of the music, but not really all that interested in the rest. What a rude surprise that it wasn't on there. I ordered it before it's release and no reviews were available, and there was no mention in the description. No offense Amazon...don't see this as your fault, but shame, shame, shame, on this company record label and the whole cast of characters. It's got me upset enough that I may boycott the movie!!!!! How can you have a movie soundtrack without the the theme song??? I can't state strongly enough, in words that will be allowed to be shown here, how furious this makes me.
B002NHGG92|5.0|i love the series are ther best and is getting better and better everyone ask where did u buy the series i say amazon.com

B008S4FZHI|5.0|Patricia Cornwell at her best, this was a can't put down book, I loved every moment of it and didn't want it to end, absolutely 5 stars
B009LL4LMM|4.0|I personally think people freak out way too much about permissions on Amazon, so I'm neglecting that part and focusing solely on just the game. The premise of Jellyflop! is simple: you're a jellyfish that yearns to fly. In order to accomplish that goal in this game, you draw lines on each level in order to bounce the jellyfish around to collect the drops of water and the feather at the end. My only issue was with the controls, which seem slightly off. It's not that big of a deal however, since this is a learn from your mistakes kind of game. Graphics are bright, colorful, and detailed. The character is adorable. I'm sure kids and adults can both enjoy this game alike.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Okay, I was going to ignore it, but the complaints are seemingly numerous. This is what I wrote in another post.<br /><br />The problem is that people complaining about the security issue most likely don't understand what the permissions actually do.<br /><br />\\"Get notified that the operating system has finished booting.\\"<br /><br />Allows an application to receive the ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. If you don't request this permission, you will not receive the broadcast at that time.

B000W91RUG|5.0|With an item like this, it all depends on each individual vendor as to the quality of the item. The show is fantastic, and my particular set came well packed with practically no damage of any kind. It's a show about a small town hottie who moves next door to a couple of uber-nerds and their friends... what's not to like! If you love the show, then buy the DVD's! Choose from a reputable vendor who packages their products well, and has good reviews. You won't be disappointed!
0345536886|5.0|The Litigators will hold your attention and is a very enjoyable, easy read. There is a lot of drama, and just as much humor, which makes it a quite enjoyable read.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a long-time Nelson DeMille fan however this book has been a huge disappointment to me.  I am only approximately halfway through it, and I am just not sure I can even finish.  It is just too drawn out, lacking any real action and just very boring.  I find myself wondering when something is going to happen. Even DeMille's typical tongue in cheek humor is rare in this one.<br /><br />I understand this is sort of a follow-up/sequel to The Lion but.....really just not making the grade with me.

B0091REZMW|3.0|Received several prompts to download more of the game. Did a couple of times not realizing how much memory it would consume. Some of my other apps started having noticeable degradation and others would not even open. Had to uninstall
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This app is awesome! I just dont like the price. i had to ask my parents for money -.- other than that, AWESOME!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!  Such a good story and it's a really neat concept for a movie.  Acting is great (I'm not crazy about Zooey but she did ok).
B007L6VR12|5.0|Absolutely loved the humor and characters in this movie.  From the trailer that lured me in, to the ending, I was entertained.  Well written, casted and directed.  I give it 5 stars.  One of a kind type of flick.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I'm a big fan of Emma Stone and I knew I would love this movie since it got great reviews.  I haven't read the book but I want to after watching this.  Story does kind of drag on but the acting is great! Wonderful message.
B005GSVFB4|5.0|I bought this to see how it would look in 3d.  It was great and I love the toy story series of movies.  This was received very timely and in excellent condition and works great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book (and series) was a very easy, quick read and extremely entertaining. This book is enjoyable on an entertainment level, but it also offers a very intelligent and witty commentary on current issues such as government, poverty and reality entertainment. It was extremely well written with easy to relate to characters and a refreshing dose of unpredictability. I'd recommend for junior high through adult readers.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I bought this dvd because the price was good.  I could not get it for cheaper anywhere else.  It was received very timely.

1606863622|5.0|I received this book for Christmas two years ago. Within two days of receiving it, I finished it. I loved imagining the love story with Sparks' beautiful words. I read it before the movie came out so I was able to imagine the book with my own characters and setting. If you are looking for a quick read to help you escape from the real world for a couple days, this is your book. Sparks always comes through. Enjoy!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|This was received very timely and the movie was OK.  Johnnny Depp does and excellent job.  Quality of product was great.
038572179X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Atonement. When I was required to read this book senior year of high school, I rolled my eyes and bought the book. But now, Atonement sits on my book shelf untouched by dust because I have read it several times over. McEwan's characters are well developed and I could feel for each character, whether a good or bad situation. This dramatic novel has a surprising twist at the end that I did not expect at all. When I turned the last page, I felt that bittersweet feeling of finishing a fantastic book. I suggest this book to anyone who is wanting to read a classic novel but does not know where to start. Here is a great one. Enjoy.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I bought this movie for the 3d effect and it was received very timely and in great shape.  The price was also very reasonable.

B001QB5S3G|3.0|This is a film with many prominent actors, a compelling story of good versus bad, weak versus mighty, and the clash of western and native cultures.  If that sentence alone were adequate to describe the film, I would not hesitate to give it five stars.<br /><br />Unfotunately, that's not the case.  Approaching it as an nonreligious person simply wanting an entertaining (and perhaps somewhat historical) film, I found it to be sadly lacking.  First, like many movies that have a cast of skilled and famous actors, it relies more upon the actors than the story.  The story develops haphazardly, and in starts; often it's not clear what is going on and one almost wishes for subtitles given the native language.  Second, character development is minimal, even for several of the primary characters, which made them seem flat and unreal.  It seems like this was a movie that took on far more than it could achieve in a mere two-ish hours, and you're left with a feeling that at its very best, this movie was less than mediocre.  On this basis, it deserves one star, if that.<br /><br />On the other hand, I can see how it would appeal powerfully to christians/catholics who are seeking a movie that reaffirms their faith.  If you don't care about the particular individuals involved in it, this film presents a powerful message of the corruption of power but the basic goodness of love for one's fellow man and love of God from the viewpoint of devout persons.  So from that standpoint, were I religious, I'm sure that I would give it five stars.<br /><br />So on average, I give it three stars.  But that being said, you'll either love it or just really not care for it.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I thought this movie was funny and done well.  It arrived very timely and the price was good.  I enjoyed this movie.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Whether it is ordering new glasses or buying a house, having a checklist keeps you from making mistakes.<br />I know because I didn't have a hardcopy of a checklist with me when I bought the two things I just mentioned<br />and I lived to regret the decision. We think we'll do all right, but we mortals forget.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I thought this movie was great.  alot of action and laughs.  I arrived very timely, the price was right and the movie was worth it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book divides into two parts: Life in camp and escape, and Life afterwards.  The first section is riveting and tragic.  Excellent!  The second half is somewhat boring.  But, don't take this as criticism.  I suspect that the somewhat less riveting ending aptly illustrates the let down of lives of survivors of many similar life experiences.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|I like the first Ghost Rider movie better than this one.  This movie had good special effects and the story line was OK.  I just thought the first one was better.
B009NOVCU6|5.0|This is a great compilation.  I like that the songs are in chronological order.  I like the sound quality of the tracks.  I generally like the song selection, although I probably would have included more songs from the Mick Taylor years and omitted some on the 3rd disc.  The Stones are a treasure and make no mistake about it, when Keith Richards takes his last breath, rock and roll will go with him.  And I don't get the whiners who complain about the band putting out an additional compilation.  It is their golden anniversary and there is no better time to put out a compilation than now.  If you are happy with Hot Rocks or Forty Licks, fine.  But the Stones are a band with a catalogue rich enough to fill ten more compilations, if you ask me.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I bought this movie for the 3d effect.  This is one of the best 3d movies I have ever seen.  The quality was excellent and the price was very reasonable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|People's reactions are congruent across a range from denial to fear to aggressive self-preservation. Some characters you love. Some you absolutely loathe. But a zombie head-shot is a wonderful thing.<br />They introduce an ebony warrior girl with a B.A. Bushido blade whose instincts so far are always right on. And the zombie heads are right off! ha ha ha!
B005IZLPME|5.0|I brought this for the 3d effect.  Product was received very timely and the price was good.  I feel it was a very good pruchase.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|this book was sincere in its presentation, contained somewhat, but normally flawed characters-some more than others, but true to life.  interesting, informative, educational, and quite moving on some primal level of the human soul.  Refreshing, engrossing, and so well-written.  One of the most multifaceted philosophically thought provoking books; ultra-intense  sometimes, often subtle, but one of the best reads I've enjoyed in several years. Has an appeal to vastly different people with different, often opposing perspectives, yet there is a common thread which bonds all.  I'm so thankful this book was referred to me by a couple of close friends, as well as my 23-year-old daughter. I feel more aware of others, myself, and what drives us to attempt , and succeed what we've been conditioned to believe is futile, as well as a meaningless effort primarily \\"suffered through to produce results of improved physical appearance, to be suffered through for weight loss, or other vanity-related reason.<br />This book brings attention to those who run for deep, sincere, character-building,(among a few), even primal sources of motivation, strength, support, bonding ---read this!  If you're not a runner, it still an uplifting story!  Some of my faith in mankind was rekindled through the journey of this book!  Loved it, love the author's style!
B005GSVFBE|5.0|I bought this because it was a 3d movie.  I received it very timely and it was in great shape and was a great movie.  The 3d was great and recommend this to anyone who loves 3d.

B004I9CXHW|5.0|I have a 2012 VW cc and the MDI cable sold by dealer is $37, which is not that bad. But this cable fits perfectly well in the glove box. You need to unplug the original MDI cable that meant to connect to Apple products and plug this one in. Do NOT try to connect this with the original cable because that's not gonna work. Once I put in a 32GB USB flash drive, the car starts to play music on it right away. Very happy!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series on TV right now.  Can't get enough of it!  You will not be disappointed.  My wife and I watched 3-4 episodes a night until we got caught up to season 3 which is the best one yet.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Book was definitely not as engaging as her previous works. Found some parts of the book a bit tedious to get through. Was expecting more from this author than just documented gossip.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Though I didn't like this one as much as the first, A Game of Shadows will definitely find a spot in my home DVD library.
B004LQEYAG|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie with an exciting plot.  I highly recommend it.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that, because of the subject matter and the ending, I wouldn't recommend it for children.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Enjoy multiple puzzles, different levels and ability to improve times. Very nice graphics, tiles are well marked, enjoy the art work.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As the author is a Doctor and a Harvard grad - especially in the field of neurscience,  I feel this book was extraordinary.  I am already a person of great Christian faith but always read those NDE books to allow my spirituality to resonate.  This book should give great comfort to those even without faith and without the benefit of a Christian (or other) spirituality belief.  A great read with scientific backup.  Thank you Doctor for your gift of sharing.  Read it, read it, read it.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|A pretty good read.  I frequently found myself laughing at loud at this one, which is pretty rare for me.  I give it 3.5 stars because it wasn't a page Turner for me, and I could have easily set it aside to read something else.
B005LAII8K|4.0|After seeing the movie Looper two weeks ago it is safe to say that the film will be ranked towards the top in science fiction films of the past twenty years in my book. This is probably the best time travel movies since the Back to the Future series and puts a whole new spin to the time travel dangers and obstacles with an old school mob spin on it. Looper is set in 2045 and the main character Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is part of the mob and hired to do the dirty work of the mob in the future and take care of the dirty work of the mob in the future. In the future it is almost impossible to kill someone without the government noticing due to tracking devices, so they send them into the past to be disposed of.  The people that do this for the mob are called Loopers. These loopers don't always work for the mob and one day they have to stop. They stop working when they close their loop, this happens when your future self is sent back in time to be killed by you in the past. This closes the loop and the person live out the next thirty years of your life with a lot of money. When Joe's loop is going to be closed it doesn't go according to the plan and his loop gets away. That is when present day Joe has to take the situation into his own hands. I was amazed at how well they made Joseph Gordon-Levitt look extremely similar to how Bruce Willis looked when he was younger completing the illusion that time travel exists.Overall great movie, definitely worth the buy.
B005XQ973M|5.0|Great, but shocking work.  I was aware of this incident, but not these details.  People should know.  It explains some of the recent Sino-Nippon tension
B007EECSFA|5.0|this book was slow to start but because i had read the Secret Garden and LOVED it.. its one of my top books i have ever read. that i thought i should give this one a chance and glad i did.. it really got you at the end.. WOW
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is awesome, and brutal.  A great adaptation of the book.  Certain events are expected, but the delivery in the TV show is a great perspective on an already awesome story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I got the book and read the whole thing in one night. I am a fast reader. I can't wait for the next book!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This was a tender and passionate love story that made me smile in its naïveté.  I have shared great moments in romantic relationships and the idea of eternally being in that moment holds the greatest appeal to me however unrealistic it is.  To feel and live that passion each and every day is a fantasy realized only in print I'm afraid.  The movie was visually stunning from the cast to the wedding and to the honeymoon.  A great fantasy and indulgence to savor.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|AWESOME! Yes it is. Ordered it on Saturday and received it today!<br />Now to get something straight these are the Broadcast episodes!!! Now I've been watching this amazing set, and I'm barely on season 1, but so far I'm not missing the extended cuts. There are three reasons.<br />1. These episodes are the way these episodes were meant to be seen!!<br />2. All the episodes are stunning in blu ray<br />3. There are a few episodes extended and the original \\"The One Where Ross Tells Rachel\\" in it's unedited glory.<br />Bottom line: Friends are finally on Blu; enjoy!!! For all the bad reviews out there: own the set and then write your reviews. All the negative reviews are swaying fans from purchasing this awesome friends set!!<br /><br />You get all 10 seasons, HI DEF, and a chalk load of extras!!!!<br />Quit complaining and enjoy that we get Friends on blu ray!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I love autobiographies, but was a bit let down by this one. I guess Tina Fey is still at a place in her career where she's tiptoeing around, trying not to tick anyone off in the business. Nothing much was revealed. I wish she'd just waited until she was older and could be more forthcoming.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This album is really great. I love to listen to it while working out or gaming.  I love this album!
B009JZVT70|5.0|This is a show that my whole family enjoys. Including a 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. It's fun and a cool twist on all the typical fairytale tropes. The fact that the pedigree of the show's creators includes Lost and Battlestar Galactica ensures great story telling. Go get yourself lost in Storybrooke.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not the usual type of book I look for.  Definitely kept my interest.  I will get the next in the series to see what happens.
B00A4GHJ1I|1.0|Great episode, but I shouldn't have to view reviews and commercials at the beginning of each show.  Ironically, Fox don't even bother to include a Glee preview within their other commercials).
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Of course the theater viewing tops everything, but this was close.  Being able to rewatch in your own home is great too.
0316228532|3.0|JK Rowling's voice is the only bright spot in this grim tale of unsatisfying marriages, child abuse, drug abuse, and rape. Well-written, but I didn't want to finish it.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album! Personally, I am having a difficult time seeing how others are so disappointed. This is the first CD that I've listened to over and over again after being let down by other much anticipated releases this year. I was waiting for the next CD that would keep me interested and invoke all sorts of emotions. Lotus delivers what I was looking for.<br /><br />Besides some amazing ballads, there are some silly, in-your-face type songs too. Circles was playing in the background as my boyfriend and I were making dinner and he said to me, \\"Did she just say something about spinning around in circles on my middle finger?\\" Yup... she did. And I'm okay with that. Sometimes you need a fun, silly song to celebrate the adversity that makes you, well you.<br /><br />In short, kudos to Christina for giving her fans yet another another collection of songs to fall in love with and blast in their car when the world isn't so kind. I can always count on Christina to do just that.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Not even halfway through season three and this is the best season yet.  There have been jaw dropping moments in nearly every episode and the return of great characters.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Incredible. Forthright. Awesomely frightening. An honest retelling of a tragedy . Grace, survival and reunification? We owe Jaycee a debt for writing this.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Feed me semore!!! I have always love love loved this movie!!  It reminds me that just like real life there's a struggle between good & bad or right & wrong...remember live backwards spells evil,ending was a funny surprise that's all I'm gonna say!!! Great movie
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Got it because it was a freebie and I have been suggesting it to everyone since. I found my self getting emotional while reading it. The end was unexpected and left me thinking about it for days.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is amazing. Even though the controls aren't very good.it is still awesome. of you are looking for a puzzle game you are looking at it.It gets harder and harder as you get farther into the game.I LOVE IT&lt;3
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Good book!  Another quick read with the continuation of characters Rook and \\"Roach\\". It also maintained the humor that was enjoyable in the first books.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing.The coins change color as you get farther into the game.It is fun, mostly when your really board.
B0091REZMW|4.0|keeps my daughter intrigued and she loves to play. Great game that allows her to use her skills. recommend it
B003B02PF4|5.0|As usual Mr. Grisham writes another great legal thriller. As with his other books I was unable to put it down, I finished in two days!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD<br />Arrived quickly, and well packed. Great buy and a SUPER GREAT movie DVD & Blu-ray combo, with digital copy as well.
B0094GW6YE|5.0|One of the great releases from 2012!!!!<br />Band in your best form, doing music to your older and new fans.<br />Energetic, Powerful...<br />Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer are the engine of this album.<br />Essential!!!!!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Logitech Gaming Mouse G300 with Nine Programmable Controls (910-002358) -PLUS-<br />Logitech G13 Programmable Gameboard with LCD Display are a SUPER combo for gaming, PLUS regular usage.
B008RTE08E|5.0|BEATLES OFFICIAL ITEM!!!!<br />BUY!!!!<br />IF YOU THINK THAT THIS TRIP IS WASN'T PLANNED, THIS FILM BECOME EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL!!!!!<br />CLASSIC BEATLES MOVIE!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed them all. This one had all the twists and turns I've come to expect from his books. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, our hero surprised me as well as \\"the establishment\\" which I greatly appreciated. I look forward to his next book and will surely purchase it for my Kindle. I have several favorite authors, many of them have become somewhat predictable in their plots but Grisham manages to surprise me.
B0094AYT36|5.0|What can I talk about the band that have in your cast ex member of Deep Purple, Dream Theater, Joe Bonamassa and the son of my favorite drummer of all time?<br />Wonderful!!!<br />I recommend to all Zeppelin and Purple fans!!!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I rented this movie because my girlfriend kept loving the previews. She watched it without me but continually raved that it was one o the best movies she'd seen in a while.
1419705849|3.0|This was just an okay read, it did have a few chuckles in it, but they were far and few in-between. The series is starting to show it's age.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems I had was that the plot varied. It start off before Greg was born, and we get his views on what is going on, and then it moves on to his early life. It just didn't mesh with the rest of the book. I saw no purpose to it. To me, it was just filler.  The main plot of the book is there's a school dance, and you guessed it, Greg is the third wheel and it's not a surprise who gets the girl.  It does have it's cute moments, on how everything is going wrong for Greg, it's a comedy of errors, and there a one or two spots I did chuckle at. Another problem I have with this series, is that Greg isn't growing or developing. He's the same as he was in the first book.<br /><br />If you've read the others books in the series, then you know what to expect, some chuckles, but it lacks the humor that was in the first few books.
B009KYXEY6|4.0|So I just ordered a new copy of BTD:TPE through Amazon (see comments for link) and got what I originally wanted months ago.<br /><br />Born To Die: The Paradise Edition is really two albums (BTD and Paradise) by Lana Del Rey.  The individual reviews can be found below, but all in all, if you like Ms. Del Rey's music, this is the version to get, in my opinion.  You get all the main tracks of Born To Die and the same version of Paradise you'd find if you bought it individually.  As far as I know, this is the only CD to include all three \\"extra\\" tracks for Born To Die on one disc.  When I originally bought BTD last summer, I had to track the other songs (13-15 on disc) down individually.<br /><br />BORN TO DIE (Review):  I have fairly eclectic music tastes, but this album absolutely bowled me over last summer.  I never would have expected to like someone who is described as a \\"gangsta Nancy Sinatra,\\" but this album made me like her all the same.  Born To Die is a well-written, varied effort from someone new to my musical radar.  From the dark, depressed vibe of \\"Born To Die,\\" \\"Summertime Sadness,\\" and \\"Dark Paradise\\" to the cynical but upbeat \\"Diet Mountain Dew,\\" I found myself drawn into Lana's world-weary attitude.  However, it was the literate and insightful \\"National Anthem\\" and \\"Off to the Races\\" that really made this album a permanent fixture in my collection and not just a passing curiosity.  \\"Off to the Races\\" is a superb analysis of a self-destructive relationship from both the masculine and feminine points-of-view, and its insights into the motivations, feelings, and fears of the pair, as well as its references to Nabokov's Lolita continue to fascinate me even after a year of repeated listens.  While I don't love every song, this album was my favorite \\"discovery\\" of 2012.<br /><br />PARADISE (Review):  To say that I was excited for BTD's follow-up is an understatement; to say that I was disappointed would be the same.  Where BTD features songs that feel decidedly different from each other in terms of tone, tempo, lyricism, and subject matter while still being thematically connected, Paradise is eight monotonously languid tracks with little to connect them besides a bored-sounding Lana.  There are a couple of highlights, such as \\"Ride\\" and \\"Cola,\\" but even the best Paradise has to offer would only have been middle-of-the-road efforts on BTD.  Especially disappointing is the reappearance of several tired cliches in the lyrics, including the reuse of the phrase \\"[doing something] in the pale moonlight,\\" which was okay once on BTD but should not have been used at least twice here.  BTD showed that Lana's versatile voice and world-weary attitude could do different and worthwhile things; Paradise shows that cynicism and vulgarity aren't worthwhile by themselves.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I absolutely love Lana Del Rey's Born To Die album.  I bought it on a whim this summer when Amazon had the MP3 version for $.99, and I was absolutely bowled over.  I was so excited to buy it on CD (I still love me some physical product) and get the deluxe edition of BTD along with the new songs.<br /><br />Imagine my disappointment, then, when I just popped the BTD:PE CD into my drive to copy the bonus 3 tracks to my iPhone and found out THEY AREN'T ON THE DISC!  This is not an Amazon or Best Buy problem, either; this is an Interscope Records problem, and this CD will not get the five-star review it should from me until this error is rectified.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy. I look forward to reading more from this author. I couldn't put the books down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I guess I do not like Psycho mystery, too spooky and sick for me, well written and definitely keeps you engaged
B009LL4LMM|1.0|No game needs to know when my phone boots. Justify all the permissions with a programmatic reason. Just say no to invasive permissions.
0345803485|1.0|I have read the first five chapters and this is all I can bear to read.  This is basically a Harlequin romance novel with the only twist being that I suspect they may have pre-marital sex in future chapters.<br /><br />I felt more connection with the Heathman Hotel (I have had the pleasure of staying in their junior suite) than the lame characters.<br /><br />This is a pitiful way to kill time and your brain cells.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|worlds best app.looks great on the kindle fire.besides its cost it is AWESOME.buy it.why are you still reading this review.BUY IT

B009LL4LMM|3.0|People get so crazy about permissions, this app wants to make sure you are finished booting before it allows start up. Write info on your sd card so it doesn't take up internal space. It has no access to contacts or browser history. People who get all up in arms about these permissions should probably get a second Android device and use that for apps, and use their main device as a phone only, but without apps why have an Android device in the first place, just get a basic track phone and be done with it.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|This book is so contrived that it is laughable--And the main character John Corey is unable to say a straight line throughout the novel with out being a wise guy. It is impossible to take him or the mission seriously.<br />DeMille has lost his way over the last several novels. I think i will pass  the next time.Or at least wait for the less expensive used paperback.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|and every thing kills you!and not much time to.every thing about it is dum!and when you try to make sumthing you do not now what you are makeing
B0056K4VRM|5.0|These are definitive recordings for their era. Contrary to some reviews, the sound on these recordings is excellent - as good or better than you would expect for the era. Most of the symphonies - in stereo - sound great. The Requiem and a few symphonies and other works are mono recordings, which sound good for their age. In summary, of the 6 CDs, about 3-1/2 of the CDs are stereo, the remaining 2-1/2 mono. For this price, consider the stereo CDs as the main event, and the mono ones as a bonus. Bruno Walter's Mozart is not to be missed, and this is a great way to acquire this magical meeting of the musical minds.
B00006AW2M|5.0|You'll never hear any of the members of the Rolling Stones come forward and defend this record-because it represents creativity, color and most of all imagination which the Rolling Stones abandoned a long time ago. This album is indisputably the best album the Rolling Stones ever recorded. The album is filled with color, imagination and most of all melodic sensitivity which is rarely seen or heard of in the hestorical musical landscape. So much music that has been created over the past two centuries has been like cheap romantic novels-but because the Rolling Stones were recording at a time in 1967 when artists were challenged to create in ways that extended boundaries, boundaries beyond their safty image zone-composing melodically and musically. It is said that the Rolling Stones took a year to record this album-and the hard work shows-the Rolling Stones have always seemed to come up with excuses to apologize for this album. But there is nothing to apologize for-it is an album that many generations from now people will still enjoy(while all the other Rolling Stone records done after Brian Jones Passed away-fade into obscurity). Again it requires emotional intelligence and a sensitivity- so if your superficial and things with color and imagination are to sentimental-and you can only identify with muscle macho tough guy music put out by Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Cold Play, Nervana and other poor music that follows along these lines-you may not have the  ability to enjoy this great musical creation.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|This book was highly recommended to me and I saw the interview with the author in Oprah. (I thought the notes from Oprah in the kindle version was a neat feature.)  I just couldn't get over some of the logistical details.  This may be a silly critique for a true story but it just did not seem believable!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was by far the most interesting book I have read. I could did not want to put it down. It may be a little over the top but then it may not have been as interesting.
140053271X|2.0|The first time I turned the product on, the screen was flickering consistantly, making reading a book difficult.  I returned the product, as I deemed it as defective, and have been having issues for two weeks with trying to get my refund processed.  Will not purchase from this seller again.  On a side note, Amazon customer service has been very helpful in trying to get this situation straighted out.
B000TEUSJU|5.0|The three disc &#34;Imperial Edition&#34; contains a wealth of back-story.  The movie itself seems to be close to historically accurate. The graphic sex and mayhem is hard to watch sometimes, but seems to contribute greatly to the overall theme of the movie although I doubt there was that much sex in any era.
B008220AVW|3.0|I had ordered this movie because I really like Katy Perry.  All of her music is awesome but the movie had way to much hype for it.  I would say the movie was okay but not great.  It was a lot less than what I had expected it to be.  As for recommending the movie I would say they would have to order it themselves and make their own judgement.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I Love this game cause I like too kill zombies. but it is very fun and challenging. I think all age groups would enjoy this game very much. Iamb in my 40s And I think its fun.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Nearly identical to the award winning comic while making things clear since the style of the original at times was a tad difficult to follow. Still I think the could have done better with the narration from the book, mostly because it leaves out some of the best dialogue like \\"This would be a good death....but not good enough.\\" or \\"The rain on my chest is a baptism, I am born again.\\" just to name a few.<br /><br />I also find it unbelievably stupid people are about this being an animated feature instead of the Dark Knight \\"Rises\\" and bringing down it's rating, honestly the movie isn't even out on DVD yet. Even if you bought it by mistake, it would be a mistake any true Batman fan wouldn't regret<br /><br />I look forward to part two with the fight with Superman
0671891634|5.0|My husband read this after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad. He thinks it is an excellent book and plans to use the advise in it. He said it is clear and to the point.
B00846REIS|5.0|this was a wonderfully hot read. Cant wait to read more from the crossfire series.There were many similarities to the fifty shades of Gray books but no dominating or whips and chains
1612680011|5.0|I have not read this but my husband has. He liked it so much he has given all our children a copy as well as some of our friends.
B00785P2QC|5.0|vcp is the best. I enjoy playing it.THings are on the pricey side but other than that awesome<br />very nice game
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We bought this in 3 D. It is very well done and has a good story line. The special effects are excellent.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|The album in my opinion is very different from the first album (at least the American version). I think she took a risk, and if you are willing to get through some of the slow beginnings of some of the songs, it is well worth it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved the intrigue and mystery. one complaint i have is it erased all my progress after my kindle was drained and shut down despite being plugged in. probably more the kindles issue than gameplay
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Was told about this series about a year ago but thought - yuck - zombies!!??  However, gave it a shot and LOVE it.  So much more - storyline and characters.  Keeps you guessing about what's next.  No one sacred on this one.  Yes, blood and gore, but just think of it as special effects and cherry preserves.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great, and as long as some updates come out for pocket edition then it will continue to be great.
1609611543|5.0|This book should be required reading from fourth grade up it should be required reading by every medical dr in the nation it should be required reading by every diatician or overweight person
B004HW7JHE|5.0|My wish list was always to have extras that focused on the dialogue. Here it is! Of course, Roger Sterling gets the best lines. The season was especially good at taking the characters out of their bubble and showing the influence of the outside world, for example, the nurses murdered by Richard Speck. There is so much to enjoy here and I plan on having repeat viewings.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|Ludovico Einaudi is a master composer and elegant piano player. His music and his interpretation is timeless, nostalgic and beautiful.
B001KX50BK|5.0|An older movie upgraded to Blu-Ray.  Great quality at a reasonably good price.  Recommended for any fan of this movie.
B009LL4LMM|1.0|Other people can't understand why people complain about invasive permissions. This is expected from those who don't understand security. If I asked permission for your house key would you give it to me? What about if I was staying with you for the weekend? Now would you let me keep that house key after I was no longer staying with you? If you understand security, you'll know why many of us get so up in arms about invasive permissions.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Couldnt wait to watch each one and spent a few weekends doing nothing but watching one after another, great series to watch moved on and got the next season already and now watching them live
B001CDZZI6|4.0|it gives a person an idea of what his or hers strengths are and how to go about using your strength for your benefits and the benefit of the people around you
B009KYXEY6|1.0|A beautiful, 5-star album. However, the first disc is missing tracks #13-15, so I do not recommend buying this version. You are better off purchasing the deluxe edition of Born To Die and then Paradise separately.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Matches up pretty closely with the book, good acting and production. Shows the declining civilization, rather Romanesque in the decadence and moral decline. Definitely interested in the sequels.
B000286RNY|1.0|We ordered the DVD Shaolin Soccer and it would NOT play in English NOT even when we selected the english version. We saw the movie on TV and it was in english, but when we got the DVD and tried to play it, it was only in Chineese. The english version would not play.  I was very disapointed because I could not hear it in English. Is there a way for you to send me another copy and could you play it first to make sure that it is in english? I would rate this item a 0
B009OYSFDM|5.0|One of the better ones to come out in a while, not overly dramatic with lots of action. Surprising from the same company that makes Vamire Diaries
B009G78EE2|5.0|This man is one of the only intellectual rappers in the scene today.  Not only is that the case but mix it with some truly wonderful hooks, and great music, and you have this album.<br /><br />Wow. Buy this. i could rave all day.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|There is not much more that can be said. I found other writers stories [[ASIN:B009W9ZDHU Bounds of Passion Book 1 (BDSM Billionaire) an erotic romance short]] much better than this. There are far better stories out there, however I must admit I have read all three. ;) I am interested to see if this actually becomes a movie.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Aw some!!!!!!!!!! Best  book  I've ever read in my life try it and the rest thanks I'm cool seven ahrens
B007HACDLK|5.0|Due to the difficulties people experience in their lives it if ALWAYS helpful if the books are enabled text to speech.  Mitch Rapp is a favorite of many readers and it would be an EXCELLENT idea if ALL  Vince Flynn's books were enabled especially given the  price of the book.  IT stands to reason that it would be available to those who need to have a written and audible book.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The CW \\"Arrow\\" series starring Stephen Amell is an action packed and an intriguing interpretation of the DC comic. I am anything but a comic book expert, but this series, spun off the Green Arrow character featured in the CW series Smallville, is something new. The multiple story lines (somewhat reminiscent of the old \\"Hill Street Blues\\" scenario) along with the high-action scenes offer something for everyone. I would suggest that anyone who is a fan of NBC's Grimm might appreciate Arrow and vice-versa.<br /><br />In regards to the on-line HD delivery, the quality of the video and 5.1 audio is excellent. Best of all, no commercial interruptions.
B001XV09UG|5.0|Creepy, the piano music and masks very eerie. Awesome director, great cast including Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, great Halloween adult movie!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read this entire book in one weekend. The action and the suspense were typical of a Grisham \\"legal-themed\\" drama. The characters we're likable even under unique circumstances. As usual, I found myself hoping this ends up on film some day.
B005LAII08|2.0|-SPOILER ALERT-<br /><br />Pixar films used to be inventive, daring and adventurous:  A rat secretly operates as a chef in a five star French restaurant. An old man flies his house to the jungle with balloons.  A robot solely responsible for earth's cleanup blindly follows a newfound friend into space. Now there's excitement and originality.<br /><br />Brave is a film about a king's daughter who is forced to marry against her will. She rebels by asking a witch to cast an evil spell on her mother, who then turns into a bear. If the spell isn't broken by the second sunrise, the mother stays a bear forever. Now doesn't that just scream Disney? Doesn't that sound like the premise for every other Disney movie you've ever seen? Of course it does. Brother Bear, for one, comes to mind.<br /><br />Brave's animation is flawless and spectacular. But that should come with every Pixar film, like a toy comes with a Happy Meal. Kudo's to Pixar for introducing a female protagonist. Merida really is lovely, she possesses a terrific voice (Kelly Macdonald) and her hair flows magnificently. The rest of the characters, unfortunately, are simply not interesting enough and are largely forgettable, especially Merida`s three younger brothers, who are used solely for comic relief and as a handy standby to keep the plot going.<br /><br />The dialogue is riddled with trite and clichéd family melodrama.  Merida and her mother's back and forth bickering bored me to tears. (Mother: \\"You listen to me!\\" Merida: \\"This is so unfair! I'm not going to be like you!\\" Mother: \\"You're acting like a child!) And so it goes on ad infinitum. That is such lazy scriptwriting.  And what about the blue wisps? What are they? Where do they come from? They're an essential component to the story and yet, their origins are never explained.<br /><br />Pixar's comedy is always on the cutting edge. A laugh very minute. Sadly there are very few genuine belly laughs present here. It's mostly slapstick fare, particularly during the comedic action sequences. Of course, the story's ending is utterly predictable, like most Disney films.  Merida puts on her brave face - excuse the pun - and saves her mother who becomes human again. Still, the ending is sweet, poignant and heartfelt.<br /><br />Brave is by no means a bad film. But it won't be recognized as one of Pixar's best. In fact, a film such as \\"How to train your Dragon\\", a Dreamworks film, fares far better in comparison. For my money, Pixar should get Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) or Pete Docter  (Monster's Inc. and Up) back in the director's chair. I see Docter, who directed the first Monster's Inc. film is not even scheduled to direct the next Monster's Inc movie, Monsters University. What a shame.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The most epic story I have ever read, lord of the rings is good but takes a back seat to this.  I was depressed when I finished the 5th book because there is no more to read at this point.  I know there is more to come but it will be years :(<br /><br />Would read again and again.<br /><br />In fact, I was so enthralled by A song of Ice and fire, I took up sword training and bought a genuine Albion long sword hehehe.

The one I received features a clip for attaching to your belt, bag, or visor in your car; Belt clip & magnetic flap closure; it is a Plantronics Original Accessory. For some reason my order history points to this one, but it is not the one I bought. If you are interested in a carry case for your voyager x, browse a bit more in Amazon and/or search the one I just described, it is of excellent quality and the magnetic flap closure is more convenient.

B009LL4LMM|5.0|Been playing this game since the beta on my old Evo 4g.  Was really glad when they got the game released, and working on the new Evo 4g LTE.<br /><br />The game is a lot of fun, as you try and get Jelly to the feather, in hopes of fulfilling his dreams of flight.  This game takes a LOT more thought and skill than similar games out there, as you're not just slingshotting things on the screen.  You have to create bumpers and play angles, making it a great game, especially for kids.  Teaching them how things bounce on angles is elementary geometry at its finest, without all the complex forumlas!<br /><br />Graphics: Good<br />Gamplay: Fun!<br />Overall: This is a game you should definitely play!<br /><br />I'm a big fan of this game, and think you should be to!
1451620829|3.0|There have been a few rock star autobiographies (Vince Neil comes to mind) where after reading them I've said to myself \\"Man, I don't think I like this dude.\\". This book, unfortunately, is one of them.  On the positive side Peter comes across as a very emotional guy who puts every ounce of his heart and soul, good or bad, into everything he does. But......his HUGE sense of entitlement and self importance borders on absurd. His stories about his second marriage in particular are brutal. Him and his wife just come across as horrible human beings and it might just be the most shallow relationship you'll ever read about.  His addiction to fame and adulation runs amok throughout the book and his rants about band members ( in particular Paul) come across as mean and petty when I think Peter wants you to feel sympathy for him. Not buying it. Awesome drummer for the greatest band ever who inspired TONS of kids but we need another book when the anger, addiction to fame, and ego have subsided.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|After years of waiting and waiting, we finally got an album from Soundgarden. And they didn't disappoint! The train keeps growing and growing. Really like this. I am a huge fan of early stuff, and this release keeps me going for sure. One of the greatest bands on earth!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Love this disc. While not as \\"catchy\\" as \\"Sonic Boom\\" I don't think the band was going for that vibe with this album. Seems to have more of a classic hard rock 70's vibe to it. Paul has stated he was listening to a lot of Humble Pie during the making of this and boy can you tell in the songs \\"Shout Mercy\\" & \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\". Both have a timeless classic rock feel to them! Great playing throughout. Two classics in a row after the disappointment of \\"Psycho Circus\\".

0307744434|2.0|A friend recommended this book to me because I love Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell.  I was looking forward to a good period magical novel.  But good lord, what a chore.  This book is an effort to get through.  Shallow, boring characters that never develop.  A plot that never makes any real sense.<br /><br />The descriptions are vague and flat, trying to hint at beauty so striking it can't be described, but instead simply falling back on vagueness because of the author's inability to write compelling imagery.  The author never develops any emotional connection to anything and I keep wondering who exactly the main characters are supposed to be because I don't care about any of them.<br /><br />The book is pretentious and boring and far too in love with its own certainty of the beauty of its imagery.<br /><br />Also, the random chapters in second person?  Stop it.  The perspective is jarring and I am certainly not as \\"delighted\\" with the two-dimensional circus as your narrator.

B005BJ7Y54|3.0|Father, Song, Holy Ghost is one of those eerie hard to pin down albums that floats with a magical memory, as if you'd been listening to the songs for your entire life; songs filled with familiar harmonies and so many influences that it's tough to define ... instantly bringing to mind the work by MGMT.  Their best numbers move with shuffling chord changes, are bright as anything done by The Beach Boys, and ascend like bottle rockets, exploding vivid colours across the horizon of a forgotten beach, trying in vain, though non the less trying, to hold back winter's complexion for just one more day.<br /><br />By no means does every song swirl in the breeze, some turn into down right minor metal anthems that slice across the musical canvas, utterly turning you in your chair, and while not as intimate, seem to work contextually, though not so much as an individual play ... almost refusing to stand on their own without the thickly layered delicate balance and trembling vocals that brought them to a juxtaposition-ed life in the first place.<br /><br />Any fan of Real Estate, MGMT, Explorers Club, Teenage Fan Club, or even The Eels is going to walk away with at least a handful of songs that will last a lifetime.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B002VECM72|5.0|This is one of the most gripping films I have ever seen.  It is a story of conversation and salvation.  One can watch Leigh Ann and Michael change due to each other’s needs. They are so much alike in their need for each other.  I found this to be a film I can watch many times and learn something new each time.<br /><br />Sandra B certainly earned her Academy Award.  I thought Aaron (Michael) should have been considered also.  Perhaps is resume is not complete enough for consideration.
B00000IBDY|4.0|Everyone wanted to make a Sgt. Pepper album, and even if they didn't, a band's best effort was often referred to as, \\"Their Sgt. Pepper Album ...\\"  But Sgt. Pepper was an anomaly that few would ever come close achieving, with bands like The Moody Blues repeating the effort over and over until their efforts were considered their style.  Having often been to Europe as a teen, I was given an insight that many weren't privy to, and believe me, this outing by Tomorrow is chocked full of secret messages, references, and insights ... obviously the band didn't rely on the less-is-more approach, but rather thought to overwhelm the fans with their wisdom, inside jokes, and secret handshakes.  It's sad that the musical times and landscape changed so completely that this little gem never really found the surrealistic psychedelic niche in time to save itself from almost complete oblivion.<br /><br />The opening track, and probably the best of the lot, \\"My White Bicycle,\\" holds a double reference ... the first being a nod to Albert Hofmann, the creator of LSD in 1943, who was riding home on his bicycle when the acid kicked in and opened his mind.  The second is a reference to the Dutch practice of communal bicycles, which were painted white, and could be used by anyone.  The second track directly challenges Colonel Brown of Cambridge University and his unusually harsh actions as a strict disciplinarian, acting as a lightening rod to challenge the strict senseless rules of society.  \\"Auntie Mary's Dress Shop\\" is an obvious take on both \\"Penny Lane\\" by The Beatles, and \\"Dedicated Follower Of Fashion\\" by The Kinks, and no doubt a bit of truth as related to the lads themselves.  It's here that Tomorrow actually give up their pretenses and cover \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" though bring little new to the table.  \\"Three Jolly Little Dwarfs\\" is a psychological metaphor for people who envision themselves as both adults and children at the same time ... failing that, then then boys were actually stoned on Acid watching dwarfs romp in the summer sun; an image that never ceases to make me smile.  This leaves \\"Hallucinations\\" [owing way too much to Cream, and what would become known as \\"Sea Of Joy,\\" by Blind Faith] and \\"My White Bicycle\\" as the standout everlasting tracks, and probably the only ones your ever gonna need.<br /><br />Despite all this, Tomorrow are a stunning reflection of the times from which they rose, being the first band ever to record a John Peel Radio 1 session.  And that's probably Tomorrow's greatest failing, that they reflected the times, rather than creating the times.  It's not really a comfortable album to say the least, filled with the inherent trippy visionary wordplays that were better done by The Amboy Dukes ... never the less, this little ditty is a must-have, or at least a must-listen, for anyone seeking to connect the dots, as it is some of the best Psych-Pop that was done at the time.<br /><br />Fair warning ... it's not an album to be used as the background soundtrack to your trip, though I'm more than sure that many people did.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerctually stoned on Acid watching dwarfs romp in the summer sun; an image that never ceases to make me smile.

B000ILYYJE|5.0|If this were some sort of infomercial, you'd be seeing me on your TV screen decked out in some hip hugger bell bottomed wide-whale red corduroys, a three inch wide belt, buckle slung to the left side, a black ribbed turtle-neck sweater, hair straight and long, parted in the middle, dancing ear-rings, suede Beatle boots, and the all important turquoise bracelet.  With \\"Light My Fire\\" slowly fading into the background I'd flash you the peace sign, saying, \\"It's been 40 years since I first dropped acid, my trip accompanied to the tunes of one of the greatest rock bands of all time, a band who's musical heritage will last into eternity, with the image of their lead singer Jim Morrison, who died tragically too young, frozen in time and forever young.\\"  Then The Doors song \\"Touch Me\\" would fade in, I'd do a quick little dance move, giggle and go into my spiel:<br /><br />Commemorating the 40th anniversary of The Doors, Rhino Records and Warner Music have pulled out all the stops, presenting an uncompromising boxed set, and repackaging The Doors' catalog in an unprecedented manner, for one of the most ambitious musical undertakings of all time.  All six of the original albums, from 1967's The Doors to 1971's L.A. Woman have been completely remastered by the three surviving members along with original producers Paul Rothchild and Bruce Botnick in double disc editions. In addition to the original remastered recordings, there is an accompanying second DVD disc for each album. Each DVD features the original album remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround sound, along with rare, often unreleased video content including live performances, video films, rehearsal footage and more.  An as if all of this weren't enough, each original CD also includes several bonus tracks, including both alternate studio takes and previously unreleased material, completely new liner notes for each album, and it all comes in this big ol' box that opens itself like ... what else[?] ...a door.<br /><br />But that's just what we get here in the States.  Over in Europe, the Doors 40th anniversary is apparently an even bigger deal.  In addition to the Perception box, with two extra tracks not on the stateside version, the French are getting something like ten or so additional new collections of rare and unreleased material. They are even getting at least one additional boxed set.  Here's just a sample of what France gets:<br /><br />For starters, there will be a boxed set devoted entirely to what are being called \\"bootleg recordings.\\" There are also a number of new collections of live recordings.  These include two complete early performances recorded at the Aquarius Theatre that can be bought either separately or as a multiple disc set.  Another multiple disc set collects performances from Detroit and other cities.  These can also be purchased separately but a bonus performance from what I believe was Philadelphia can only be obtained by getting the complete boxed version ... and I was at that show.  Over seas they also get two volumes of Jim Morrison interview discs, where one entire disc is completely devoted to an interview Mr. Mojo Rising did for Circus Magazine back in the 60's, covering among other things, the fallout from the infamous 1969 Miami Incident.<br /><br />I've often asked myself in retrospect, \\"Are The Doors important enough to warrant the 40th anniversary treatment they receive on the Perception box here in America?\\"  The answer ... \\"Of course they were.\\" And given what Rhino had to work with in terms of actual released material, they have done a superb job of repackaging it. Perception is the sort of eye and ear candy that will draw collectors like a magnet. For audiophiles, the superb 5.1 surround sound mixes should ring a few more cash registers for those high-end hardware retailers.  Sadly, for actual musicologists, the alternate takes and unreleased material are pretty limited when you consider the price tag. As for all the 40th anniversary overkill in France and Europe, my guess is that it all will all be available here in America around this time next year. Which I guess is great news for all you Doors \\"completists\\" out there.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslern France and Europe, my guess is that it all will all be available here in America around this time next year.

B0074MZSWW|3.0|Alabama Shakes filter through the Atlanta woods like evening fog creeping across the fallen leaves ... and before you know it you're ankle deep in spooky wonder.  Their songs are bluesy and haunting, especially when delivered by the soulful voice of Brittany Howard, a voice which can move from melodic to joyous outbursts that reach right out and caress your soul.<br /><br />This is honest music, pure American, gritty dirty warm Southern rock with heavy blues overtones that are laced with an alternative country vibe, one that will have you searchin' out their front porch just sit a spell and hear it all simmer live.  The opening track \\"Hold On\\" is so infectious that it will leave you wasted and begging for more.  If there's a drawback to the album, it's that they dropped this song on as the opening track, instead of making it the last song you'll ever want to hear again.  Nearly all of their creations are filled with a cool intensity, bounding melodies and rousing vocals that bring the songs to life in a most unexpected manner.  That being said, there are a fair number of intensity impassioned heartbreak filled numbers that convey a trance-like depth and melancholy that had me wondering how anyone could understand my distress so well.<br /><br />Come on ... give `em a spin, what've you got to lose?<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|With The Rising Bruce set his songs to the tragedy triggered by the events of September 11th, while Devils & Dust was a direct response to the re-election of the most miserable President this nation has ever known ... and in all the years I've been following Mr. Springsteen [and those years go back to the Main Point in Ardmore, and The Stone Pony in Jersey] there's always been a feeling of hope in his music, at least until now.  Bruce has forever been the eternal optimist, from his early outings where he and the band were running wild down the backstreets, there has always been an essence of time standing still, with the horizon being a line of demarcation, which once crossed, opens the whole world to anyone who's had a vision, and set out to make it real.  But here on Wrecking Ball, for the most part, Bruce has entirely lost me.<br /><br />Instead of standing tall with the stars at his back, Bruce hunkers down with a series of endless ballads that go on much too long.  Perhaps I've heard too many of his ballads over the generations, perhaps he's got nothing new to say, perhaps he's lost his way ... regardless, \\"We Take Care Of Our Own,\\" \\"Easy Money,\\" \\"Shackled & Drawn,\\" \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" and \\"You've Got It,\\" are the only songs that inspire gutsy strength and stamina, with the rest of the numbers [all eight of them] sounding like the soundtrack to a grainy black and white movie about an aspiring down an out boxer who's lover dies of cancer in the hospital at the same moment he was knocked to the mat, and then out.<br /><br />Granted, discounting the nature of America these days, this is the first album without the genius of both Clemons and Weinberg, nor do any other long-riding members of the E. Street Band make an appearance either ... suggesting that Bruce, and rightly so, may be feeling truly venerable for the first time in his life.  Regardless, this is not the Bruce Springsteen we need right now.  We need the masked marvel in his tattered jeans, blistered guitar, powerful driving rhythms, musical visions of justice, kicked in the teeth and smiling, man of hope and splendor.<br /><br />I for one will be flashing the E Light off the low hanging clouds tonight, hoping to spark back to life the sleeping musical giant to fill my lungs so that I can shout down the insanity of the right-winged walls one more time.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerr, powerful driving rhythms, musical visions of justice, kicked in the teeth and smiling, man of hope and splendor.<br /><br />I for one will be flashing the E Light off the low hanging clouds tonight, hoping to spark back to life the sleeping musical giant to fill my lungs so that I can shout down the insanity of the right-winged walls one more time.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B002IDN0MW|5.0|The author wrote in the Prologue to this 2009 book, \\"If only (CEO) Dick Fuld had kept his anger, and rudeness under control. Especially at that private dinner in the spring of 2008 with Hank Paulson, secretary of the United States Treasury. That was when Fuld's years of smoldering envy of Goldman Sachs came cascading to the surface and caused Paulson to leave furious that the Lehman boss had disrespected the office he held. Perhaps that was the moment Hank decided he could not bring himself to bail out the bank controlled by Richard S. Fuld.\\" (Pg. 3)<br /><br />He argues that in the 1990s, \\"Banks were compelled to jump into line, and soon they were making thousands of loans without any cash-down deposits whatsoever... Mortgage officers inside the banks were forced to bend or break their own rules in order to achieve a good Community Reinvestment Act rating... Easy mortgages were the invention of Bill Clinton's Democrats.\\" (Pg. 4)<br /><br />He observes, \\"this was the starting point of America living in a false economy... All bubbles, down the centuries, have started that way, leading to the inevitable time when people begin to think it's normal, that nirvana has finally arrived... people all over the planet began to believe this was a brand-new easy-money world. But of course it wasn't.\\" (Pg. 77) He recounts, \\"the Lehman mortgage guys wore those smug expressions as they walked through the hallways, supremely confident... they became... demigods who rubbed shoulders with the mighty, who saw, and sometimes even spoke to, Fuld and Gregory... Whatever they needed... they got.\\" (Pg. 110-111)<br /><br />He notes, \\"We all had an uneasy feeling... Because we were all far more grounded in reality, we found it impossible to ignore the risks inherent in these modern forms of hypertrading, where rules were bent and tried-and-true methods went straight out the window.\\" (Pg. 170) Of conversations with subprime brokers at New Century, he recalls, \\"I asked them if they gave much thought to the possiblilities of defaults when the [interest] resets began. They dismissed this... 'Not our concern, pal. Our job is to sell the mortgage policy. Period. Right after that it's someone else's problem.'\\" (Pg. 185)<br /><br />He admits, \\"I hate to use the word fraud.

Because we were each about to lose a huge amount of money, as our bonus stock would shortly become worthless... 'I guess we're finished,' she said.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book, it was a great fantasy novel and sophistically written. It's a little hard to grasp in the beginning because there's so many character but once you get into it's a very enjoyable read. It's not something to put down and come back to weeks after though, there's so many plots and subplots you would have to reread chapters to remember what is happening.
B008GJVEZ2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and my favorite of all the Cohen brothers' movies. To me it's just as quotable as the Big Lebowski with its 1920s slang, most of which were uttered by Johnny Casper, Bernie Bernbaum, Mink and Eddie Dane. The scene where Leo fends off attackers at his house is brilliantly shot and paced. I recommend this movie often to my friends. Most of whom haven't seen it. It's a classic period crime drama that somehow slipped under the radar.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I liked the movie very much. Great actors and a lot of special effects. I would highly recommend this to family and friends.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Numerous dictionaries, translations, sources. and other features make this a great ap for those who love words. Great addition to my Fire.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An amazing page-turner by the great Stephen King, and my favorite SK novel of all time (I've read at least 2 dozen). Set aside an entire weekend, and don't start reading until Friday evening. A lengthy book (850 pages?), but well worth the effort. Any SK fan will love this book, guaranteed.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Everything is great. Easy to use and display is bright & clear.  This app is much better than my phone email's display.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This story picked right up where the first left off. I am excited for book 3 to come out. I have already preordered it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really loved this book. It was very interesting, heartwarming and creative. I highly recomend it. I know I will be reading it over and over.
B003R5C5JE|5.0|very well detailed replica...bought for a fanatic of the movies and it goes where he goes. Great price for a hard to find item.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|great movie! johnny depp is awesome! tim burton rules.  Michelle pfeiffer is great as well in this.  very well done.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved this book.  It's really long and may take you a while to read, but totally worth it.  Better than the first book?  You could say that.  Quit being indecisive and just download the thing!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|If you love Prometheus you'll find this set excellent.  The DVD Blue Ray looks better then anything else on my HD 1080 TV.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|The title is extremely deceptive.  I thought I was purchasing the recent third episode of the Batman Trilogy, The Dark Knight Returns, but instead it was a cartoon.  I didn't realize that I had a different product until I received it.  Amazon should avoid this type of cleverly deceiving salesmanship.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I have loved The Weeknd since House of Balloons was available for download. Last summer that's all I ever listened to. Could not wait for the second and third installments. When Thursday and Echoes of Silence were released, it was different, but good. Very good. Maybe better. In some ways better. In some ways less accessible but in others more riveting, more suction-y, more enveloping. Overall, the three releases, as wonderful as they were on their own, benefitted from each other. The trilogy was greater than the sum of their parts.<br /><br />And now we have Trilogy, the Weeknd's -- or Tesfaye's -- \\"real\\" debut on a major label. The name tells you this guy is serious. Trilogy. The three mixtapes have been remastered and lovingly put together as one. For the fans of the freely available mixtapes, there are tweaks here and there but, overall, this is a welcome change. Not that there was anything wrong before. It's just that it's so lavish now. It's good. For the newcomer, the thirty songs here may be overwhelming. My advice: take it one at a time. Listen to House of Balloons first. Obsess over Balloons. Resist temptation to listen to the others. Then, one day, maybe on a Thursday, listen to Thursday. It's very different. Then Echoes.<br /><br />Frank Ocean, Drake, and in many instances Kendrick Lamar are channelling a similar mood. The Weeknd is phenomenal. Regardless of whether Tesfaye produces anything else, it is very likely that Trilogy, a remastering of three albums that came in 2011 in quick order, will take its place as an important piece of work.
1936608618|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is very comprehensive.  It goes into great detail about how to run, bike, and swim better.  It tells many errors and how to fix those.<br /><br />It also has a lot of information about the programming section of endurance sports.  This book is great for all the athletes who aspire to take on an endurance feat and are scared to do it.  Most endurance programs have you doing so many miles that it's hard to make it through the program to the race.  This book gives great detail on how to make it through the race, do very well, and also stay strong and healthy throughout.<br /><br />He also gives you the proper information for races like nutrition, hydration, etc.  And finally, there is a wonderful section on mobility that is very important.<br /><br />Detailed and color pictures are also wonderful.  Good book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game. I love the different characters and themes. Also the power boosts are great. The only very minor thing that gets me is how it starts off slow in the beginning then picks up. I am not saying change this it's just when you are getting better at it you think,\\" Hey, I have already excelled at this part\\", but I understand you must look out for everyone so, great game.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|such a lovely voice for such a young girl. good price too for a top album. birdy is an amazing singer
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I thought it was a great app until I realized I cant do a different style on a Powerpoint. I had great hopes but they were squished when I realized this.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Downloaded from iTunes because I could not wait for my cd's to arrive.  Flawless, absolutely stunning!!!  Susan is amazing as always.  There is such power in her singing that I am drawn in with each note that she sings.  She puts so much emotion into her singing.  I never get tired of hearing that powerful, amazing voice of hers!!!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Love it, especially on my phone!  No more fishing around in my purse when left in the dark.  Use it all the time.
B003SNKBXW|4.0|I have been an avid Dumas reader since my teens, particularly The Three Musketeers.  About ten years ago I was disillusioned with Dumas when I learned that his works were heavily based on collaboration.  The author did a thorough job of detailing Dumas' works and collaborations.  I no longer fault Dumas for collaborating to the degree he did because the author protrays Dumas with the art of story telling.  I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery and suspense surrounding the main character, Corso.  The author leads us on a merry chase with a nice surprise ending.  I collect first editions and wish I had a book detective like Corso.  I hope there will be a sequel where Corso joins \\"The Club Dumas\\".
B006OAB3ME|5.0|One of the most beautiful CD/album's I've heard in years. An amazing collection of great songs, arrangements, band.I can't stop listening to it. Makes my day and night.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all three of these on my kindle in about 10 days. It helps to read them one after the other without going on to<br />other reads. It keeps the flow of the story going nicely. Anyways, all three are a GREAT read. Hunger Games book, much<br />better than the movie. Of course if your a reader, you know that the book is ALWAYS better than the movie.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Having read most of Lee Child's books, \\"A Wanted Man\\" was just a continued exciting experience. Amazon was very easy to facilitate my purchase of the book as well. I recommend using Amazon the next time you purchase books or any product for that matter because they have great selection and very competitive pricing.
B0037W68F4|1.0|I love the last album and I was waiting to listen to this one, but I didn't like it! It doesn't sound the same band! I'm really disappointed!
0741470314|5.0|This writer really took the time to research and focus on the real man--Michael Jackson.  She was not motivated by money or sensationalism.  It is a gift and a blessing to learn about the real person and his contributions to the upliftment and betterment of humanity. I believe he may eventually be recorded in history (thanks to people like this author) as one of the greatest humanitarians who ever lived. (my website [...])
B003TSEEDY|4.0|At first I wasn't sure I would like the writing style of the book, but it ended up being a really easy read. I wanted to read the book, before seeing the movie, so I am not sure how the two compare.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|WOW!!  I have a mid-level stereo with Kef floor speakers, Music Hall turntable, and Denon 4000 level receiver.  I have about 400 vinyl records and 800 cds including SACD and DVD-audio. After having sampled about 6 sides of this vinyl set I can with confidence declare that these are among the top ten in sound quality. I do not have the USB version of this set but this definitely outshines all the Beatles CD releases except possibly the \\"LOVE\\" DVD-audio. I have the mono Beatles box and this is way better.  I don't see the point of waiting for the mono vinyl set if it is just for the sound quality.  The mono cd was better since it did not have limiting.  Guess what?  Neither do these. None, including the \\"Love\\" dvd have the bottom end that these have.  You will hear stuff you never did before.  So get off your Phone headsets, upgrade your stereo and LIVE!!!![[ASIN:B0041KVW2K The Beatles Stereo Vinyl Box Set]]
B00A03WBVI|5.0|This is the best album in the world it has a mix of slow songs hang fast up beat songs plus there beautiful :)
B00914JWSW|1.0|I was so disappointed in this album.  I have collected most of her albums through the years, but did not enjoy this one.<br />I wanted to see her in LasVegas, but was unable too.  Carole
B009KYXEY6|1.0|Yet another review here to say the ad showed 3 additional tracks, the J-card lists those 3 tracks as \\"Without You,\\" \\"Lolita\\" and \\"Lucky Ones.\\"  They aren't there.<br /><br />It's called _Born To Die, Paradise Edition_, and the UPC is 602537204670.  Disc 1/2 says Paradise Edition on it in the small print, but no tracks are listed.  Disc also has a number at the end of the fine print: B0017666-72<br /><br />If you're ripping this into iTunes, you will have to manually-select the correct title from the Gracenote pulldown, but that's another problem: they all say \\"Lana Del Rey - Born To Die\\" three times.  Which do you choose?  If you rip the second disc, your choices are as before (x2) plus \\"Lana Del Rey - Paradise.\\"<br /><br />Whatever.  I love this album, love her voice, love her modern take on the coquette we all wanted when growing up.  I just can't give this a glowing review because I'm PISSED OFF that this comes up short 3 tracks.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I thought it was wonderful, it went along with the book almost to a t. It was sad and beautiful at the same time., its the newest Romeo and Juliet of our time.....Incredible
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These extra ear tips are identical to the original. Always good to have an extra pair saved if yours gets damaged.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The character development in this series is the best I have read since Pillars of the Earth.  Very unpredictable and refreshingly original.  I found Book Three to be better than Book Two and nearly as riveting as Book One.  Highly recommend Book Three
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use. Syncs with all my devices. Helps keep myself and my husband organized. Love the voice and photo note options.
0140186395|5.0|Great book with fully developed characters and moving plot.  His use of language inspires deep thought and joy on so many turns.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read a few of the Nicholas Sparks books or either seen the movies. As far as the story line, this is the best one. Its still a love story, but it's got a different twist to it. If you haven't read it yet, read it now!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie does not disappoint. The effects are amazing and the acting and story line are great. I had no complaints other than it ended to quickly.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Interesting to learn more about psychology of a sniper!  Dedicated, a bit nuts, focused but not always on what we might think is right.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Engaging characters .a compelling plot twist . Propelling you to the next book. Thank you  enjoy people word count reached
B0098VXE50|3.0|The story is an interesting take on a classic, including magic and dwarves. The scenery is well done, backgrounds and people are mostly believable. Most of the acting is good. After hearing Kristen Stewart deliver the line \\"I trust you\\" in Twilight so many times I was quite unhappy to hear it in this picture. It will go on my shelf and be watched every couple of years, not one of my favorites.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great book....I wish the characters were a little older, but the story was good.  I read it after 50 Shades of Gray and was just as pleased with it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|You can get the exact same app from 4shared and save 3 bucks. Its the same damn thing. . . . ..
159562015X|3.0|Good material, but useless without the access code.  Buy a new copy because the access code can only be used once.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is the best collection of the FOUR SEASONS hits. A great trip from the past with songs that still carry well into the next century.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is probably the best puzzle game I have played on my Kindle Fire. For the past two days I haven't been able to put it down! There are no timers or scores, so you can just relax and solve the puzzles. Once you beat the game you unlock Expert Mode which counts how many pieces of track you use to solve the puzzle. The puzzles start out really easy and get tougher as you go along until you reach one that leaves you scratching your head for half an hour. If you love a good puzzle game, and don't want to worry about timers and scores, this game is for you. I fully recommend it!
B009LL4LMM|2.0|Permission: Get notified that the operating system has finished booting.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer (jjceo): I do not like anything that self-loads on boot. That means that this game is running in the background all the time and using valuable resources on your phone or tablet and can slow down the device's startup and operation. Why does the app have to start at boot up if you are not playing it?<br /><br />Other than permissions, the game looks nice. Price tag of $2.99 is another problem, but I got it from FAOD anyways.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the previews for the movie, and while I was searching for a new book on my kindle, I ran across it.  Since the movie previews drew me in, I thought I would give the book a try.  I'm glad I did!<br /><br />At first, I was a little confused though, reading letter after letter that was written to his friend??... Then it dawned on me, I'm his friend that he is writing too.<br /><br />It sucked me right in... I didn't want to put it down.  I HAD to know what was happening to him!!  This book made me care for the characters.<br /><br />I hope the movie is as good as the book is.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As with all Grisham novels, can't lay down till the last page is read!  As always, looking forward to John's next book.
B004YD1KTO|5.0|I came across this book while browsing so I was unsure what to expect. It had me from the very beginning. I loved it. All the twists and turns kept me turning the pages. I thought I had figured out quite early on who the arsonist was but I was wrong. An absolutely brilliant read.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|A friend recommended 'The Road Less Travelled ' to me.<br /><br />She told me it was a classic she had read in college.  I certainly agree it is a classic and<br />helped me understand more about myself and the world in which we live.<br /><br />The key message for me after reading this book 'personal growth can be achieved by seeking the truth and honestly evaluating our own behaviors and relationships'
0553801473|5.0|Im hooked and am looking forward to more! I tried to savor it as I dont know when the next installment will come out, hopefully soon.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Imaginative and suspenseful with twists and turns you will not see coming. A well done alternate reality that comes to life.
0345803485|5.0|Actually I was hesitant to pick it up, but once I got to reading it I couldnt put it down. An amazing twist to the more common romance.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just finished Grisham's The Racketeer.  From the start Grisham gets your attention and holds it.  What a web he has woven.  Intriguing.  Has a James Bond feel.  Thoroughly enjoyed the book.

B009LL4LMM|1.0|Get rid of the invasive permissions and I'll try it out. Also agree a lot of fake 5 star reviews.
8866130923|5.0|This is the best planner to ever be created in the entire history of the world and universe. I have bought five. I like everything about this planner: The feel of the pages, the color of the text, the font, the visual organization, the space on the right hand side for notes, the removable address book in the back, the bookmark, the durability, the band that keeps it closed, the little file folder... Being a very particular person, this planner is perfect. Because it is brightly colored, this planner is easy to find at the bottom of any backpack. I take it with me everywhere.
B008476HBM|5.0|This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.<br /><br />The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.<br /><br />Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.<br /><br />Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual \\"table of contents\\" function. (i.e., if you click on \\"Go to...\\" the \\"table of contents\\" button will be grayed out.) Page numbers are included and total at 253; and for those who care, there are ten \\"Popular Highlights\\" at this time of writing, half of which are grouped around pages 12-15.ince I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual \\"table of contents\\" function.

B000WFBC6E|4.0|I have had this clock for a few months and it keep the best time of any of the wall clocks I have. It has gained about 5 seconds per month. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the bouncing second hand.  I bought a BrAun wall clock about the same time and t has gained about 1 min/ month,  which is typical of the wall clocks I have bought.<br /><br />Nice looking clock however it arrived with a bent second hand that stopped on the min hand. I think it got dropped. The red knob at the end of the second hand is heavy. I took it apart and straighten it out. Now the second hand clears the min hand but it bounces back and forth each second it stops.

B007Q0OUNA|5.0|I reviewed this figure for my new blog: [...] My purpose is to give unbiased, impartial reviews on popular toys on the market. This is the LEGO: Lord of the Rings: Attack on Weathertop playset. Based on the hit movie, this playset chronicles one of the intense scenes where the Nazgul Ringwraiths launch an attack on Frodo, Aragorn, and the other adventurers as they travel to Bree. Some of what is included is 430 pieces, 5 LEGO characters, 2 horses, and a mouse! The horses are the newer type and are able to rear up which is a neat touch.<br />One of the things I enjoyed about the playset was the unique construction design involving hinged pieces and simple locking mechanisms. This allowed a circular shape that stayed stable and together. The wrap-around stairs were a neat touch although they seemed a little wobbly. Keep in mind that the Attack on Weathertop set is fairly small, although it is very detailed. For more information, including pics, check out my blog at [...]

B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My daughter loves this book.  Because of it she loves to read.  She was behind in reading and was starting to hate it.  So this is big.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is an easy and fun game and is a good way to waste your time when you have nothing else to do.
B005JE1KHE|5.0|AWESOME! I first looked at these books beacuse I thought it said Robin Hood. So I took a look at it. The cover was cool and the titles were cool, so when I got them for free I jumped with joy, only to discover the story was BLOODY brilliant as well. As the story goes on it just gets better! I raced through it and on to the next!

1401322786|4.0|This novel tells the story of two seemingly insignificant people - one who is running out of time and is desperate to extend the inevitable, another who wants nothing more than to make time go faster - as they are brought together by a man who lived thousands of years ago trying to teach them to value the time they've both been given, no matter how short or long.<br /><br />'The Time Keeper' starts at the dawn of man's history with Dor and his friends Nim and Alli. As they grow older Nim seeks power and tries to control the people, Dor on the other hand seems perfectly content to build a life with Alli. Until he gets consumed by tracking time. He is the first human to make devices to count time, and as he predicts when the sun and moon come and go he even starts on the first calendar.<br /><br />But as Alli falls ill, Dor wants to not only count time, but also control it. Desperate to gain more time with his wife Dor runs up a tower, which Nim's slaves built all the way to heaven, in the hopes that the gods can help save Alli. Instead he ends up in a cave as Father Time and as thousands of years pass he hears the people's voices pleading for more or less time, never happy with the speed at which time passes for them.<br /><br />Sarah Lemon is a high school student, smarter than most of her peers and an outcast. But when a popular guy in her school suddenly pays attention to her she keeps wishing for time to go quicker so she can see him again.<br /><br />Victor Delamonte is the fourteenth richest man in the world and while he's in his mid-eighties he's still working as the head of his company. Suffering from cancer his time is quickly running out and using the wealth at his disposal Victor is seeking a way to stop time and extend his life.<br /><br />Dor observes both Sarah and Victor and as their stories escalate he comes into their lives to try and show them those things about time he didn't know himself when he was still walking the earth.<br /><br />As a readerit takes a few chapters to truly get engrossed by the novel. The writing is quite abrupt, the various storylines chopped up and intertwining even though they do not belong together yet. However, the characters gradually start to come more alive, or perhaps it was a case of me getting used to the writing style, as their stories come together.<br /><br />Other than the story being told in short chunks, making it hard for the reader to connect to the characters, the writing is beautiful. Some of the phrases that particularly stood out to me were:<br /><br />\\"It is never too late or too soon. It is when it is supposed to be.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is a reason God limits our days.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"To make each one precious.\\"<br /><br />In an age where everything is measured by time and we are absolutely controlled by it, often rushing from one place to the next because a watch or calendar or clock says we should, it's fascinating to stand still by the principle of time; how and where it started, why we're so consumed by it now and how important it truly is in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />'The Time Keeper' is a novel that makes you think, that's for sure.
B00138KD5A|5.0|You just can't go wrong with James Taylor.  His voice is so relaxing. And the classic Christmas songs he sings make it one of my favorite holiday albums!
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|When Christina said that this album was going to be as personal and diverse as Stripped, I was beyond excited. Christina's lyrics and creativity is what keeps me buying her albums time and time again. When Lotus was coming out I was counting down the days til November 13th. I put on my boyfriend's production headphones, popped the disc in and listened to it from track-to-track. When I was done he asked what I thought.<br />\\"Safe.\\" Was the first thing that came out of my mouth. He said, \\"Do you like it more or less than [Bionic]?\\" I said, \\"Lotus makes me appreciate Bionic.\\" He was shocked given I wasn't too fond of Bionic -- until now. (More on that later!)<br /><br />This album lacks that boundary-pushing, creative, innovative Christina I know and love from Stripped, B2B and Bionic. All three of those albums had amazing tracks and were anything but a safe approach to music. There's really not any stand out tracks on Lotus for me that make me want to play them over and over (see Ain't No Other Man), I skip tracks on this one which I do not have to do with Stripped, and Bionic was loaded with post-production that really challenged the ears in a good way.<br /><br />**EDITED ON 11/19**<br />I do like: \\"Lotus Intro,\\" (despite the unnecessary use of autotune), \\"Cease Fire,\\" \\"Blank Page,\\" \\"Best of Me,\\" \\"Just A Fool\\" (my absolute favorite), \\"Empty Words\\" and \\"Shut Up,\\" \\"Your Body\\"<br /><br />OK Tracks: \\"Army of Me,\\" \\"Red Hot Kind of Love,\\"  \\"Let There Be Love,\\" \\"Sing for Me\\" (although beautiful vocals!)<br /><br />Scrap it: I may get screamed at but \\"Make The World Move\\" (Has good elements to it but overall kind of annoying...), \\"Around the World\\", \\"Circles\\" (mostly the lyrics is what ruins this. Musically, it is enjoyable.) \\"Light Up The Sky\\" (give it to Katy Perry) \\"Your Body Remix\\" (waste of track space. Do an original! haha!)<br /><br />It took me two years to appreciate Bionic. After I took it on my iTunes and got rid of those nonsense songs like \\"Prima Donna\\" and \\"Vanity\\". To like 16/23 is not bad at all! As for Lotus, it's not very memorable although it has some foot-tapping tracks that definitely fits the Pop Sound of 2012. I think Christina played it too safe on this one. There are hints of that boundary-breaker in \\"Cease Fire\\" and \\"Red Hot Kind of Love\\" and \\"Blank Page\\", but the album as a whole is too safe for me.<br /><br />Vocally, it is EVERYTHING I love out of my girl, but I like my XTina pushing sound barriers, challenging the ears of her fans and critics alike, and pouring her heart and soul into the lyrics, making you feel her pain, her love, her joy, her angst. While some songs on Lotus do accomplish that, it's too few and far between for me to call this her best.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Movie was ok but silly. I think the seven dwarfs were the best part of the movie. Kristen Stewart I'm sorry is not the fairest of them all. i don't really have much to say about this move. it really was that same old story with a not so believable twist i just was not buying the characters. \\"sorry Rupert Sanders\\" if you like twilight you may like this movie...
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Arrived in no time at all and watched in the same amount of time. Love this show and this season did not fail.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awsome and it is fun and addicting. I am a little kid I am 9years old take my advice this game is cool get it if you don't.  if you say it is not cool and fun you are a dummy and so get it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Ohmi gosh i love this game!!! It has millions of hits that prove many young people love this game! I say young people because my grand mother tried it and she said it hurt her eyes since the man in the jetpack moves to fast. So beware of that factor, but if u love action games and have hand-eye cor. this is your game!
B00A17AD36|5.0|Absolutely love this cd! Wicked games and high for this is what made me buy the album and I am glad that I did.  I am at work listening to it...very quietly...and I just cant wait to get off and see my guy!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Finally, I no longer have to skip over other songs on Pandora's The Weeknd Radio just to hear more. I now have a continuous supply of The Weeknd songs. He's in a category all by himself. I call it, the MapleHood sound.
B005LAII0S|5.0|Such a fun movie. Great for older (8 and up) children but I must confess I bought it for me. Very funny and visually stunning. Lilly Collins was perfect as Snow White.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|Excellent. The boys are fabulous. Such a good read. Honest and true. The guys have done good. Long live McFly. X
B002LMV7TS|2.0|First I should mention that I love the movie. The problems that I have are with this disc not the movie. First off it says on the cover that Blu-Ray + DVD Combo Pack but there was no DVD. Second off the HD quality is quite low (you can barely tell the difference between this and DVD quality). Lastly and most importantly, this version has a lot of scenes missing. Overall very disappointing.
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun game to play. has good options and is enjoyable to play. the tap option is a good optin to have but it dont make the proper move sometimes.<br /><br />fun game
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Jim Carrey is easily at his best in this film. An oldie but a goodie.<br />The crazy senario of being watched your whole life by camera's, is almost a reality today. Only his reality is a TV show. The first child legally adopted by a corporation.<br /><br />I don't want to go into too much detail. Every piece is so important in this movie.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|I saw the film tonight in a pre-release special event Coldplay held around the world at different movie theaters. Anyone could go, but only for this one night. It's the best concert film I've seen. Great pacing. Awesome setlist. Direction is perfect. Much variety. And the behind-the-scenes conversations are very thoughtful and surprisingly inspiring. I got teary eyed during \\"Fix You.\\" I was wowed by the computer-controlled light-up bracelets during \\"Charlie Brown.\\" Fascinating to hear how Chris Martin tries to look in the eyes of about 1,000 people during any concert, and how the band has a manager/fifth member (news to me) who studies rock history, including concert production history, and guides the band with advice about why the best bands in the world were the best when they were, what pitfalls to avoid, etc. Any Coldplay fan will LOVE THIS!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|works like the website on my kindle fire hd! Sometimes trouble loading from emails though. Otherwise works well. Great graphics.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|My son really enjoys playing the game, as do I.  At the end of the day, though, it's just Angry Birds with a Star Wars twist.  The biggest problem I have is all the in-app purchases.  It's excessive -- you have to pay extra for one set of levels (Path of the Jedi) and there's package pricing on buying additional Milennium Falcons for game play.  Seems a bit much, especially given you're innundated by Rovio with ads for other Angry Birds merchandise.
0345803485|4.0|The character development is a bit slow, and does not quiet go as in depth as is needed to really become entranced with the key players of the story.  Its a good read in the same way a cult classic can withstand repeated viewings. If you break it down though, the book is strongly powering forward on its shock value. I did enjoy it, and was engaged, i just thought it was a tad over hyped for what it is. i would not tell someone not to read it, but i would not overly praise it either. I tad more work and this could have earned a 5th star.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Interesting little book, a real departure from John Grisham, easy read maybe<br />good for younger readers as well. Have the other 2 books to read, starting on<br />abduction now
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|This movie was not at all what I was hoping for and the uncomfortable love scene between the two main players made me look away. They were way too young and it was awkward and unnecessary. I really wanted to turn it off. Disliked it a lot.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I heard Avatar was good.  I ordered it because my TV went and took on Avatar never knowing.......Well, I ended up riverted in my seat for 2 hours absolute floored with this blue imaginary world.  Ah, the art of imagination was to be admired with the bird scenes..so beautiful, so exciting.. A wonderful experience!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It wasn't the best one he's done cabin fever or the ugly truth are probably the best one's he has done. Well actually I like all of them.But he is still my favorite author and he has amazing skill.Nice work.I read this book in probably 3-4 hours it was good and I love your books!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it has water and lava THIS IS AN AWESOME APP hey someone start game with visible server . . .
B0053TMP24|5.0|Love the action packed twists and turns in all of Rick Riordan's novels.  He depicts such wonderful worlds full of unexpected depth and color so that you can get lost in his vivid descriptions and jump out of your seat as your favorite heroes battle, outwit, or out-think their adversaries.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|good story plenty of charcters, keeps you guessing all the time. the endind really took my breath away you thought that about half way thru the book but after a while you say no never than bam!!
0525953590|1.0|Sean Carroll is a typical atheist physicist who arrogantly disregards creationists to the point where he does not even acknowledge they exist unless prompted (like happened on Coast to Coast AM tonight). The liberal media and filled with money sapping money-obsessed morons, willing to indebt any generation of Americans into becoming slaves. It's already happened, and Americans in general are all debt slaves because of atheism-theoretical-physics cultists like this, and the idiot atheists who worship delusional morons like this. This man won't acknowledge theistic scientists let alone creationist ones, and pretends to speak for all scientists. That is arrogant, a delusion of grandeur, bigoted, and \\"extremist\\" in the way liberals use it. It's great he claims that \\"you can do good science\\" despite believing in God, as he implied on Coast, but why did he then previously in that same show tonight, not acknowledge the millions of scientists who say the reason the universe exists is because God willed it? This is what happens when you care more about money and having the approval of the world, than having truth.<br /><br />No doubt some of you may say, \\"Oh how unfair did you read the book?\\" and Sean will think, \\"Oh a troll, he's libeling me and an obvious fundamentalist nut himself.\\" Tell me what about my review is wrong, rather than making an ad hominem attack. No doubt many of you will think, \\"This is an ad hominem attack,\\" no, a personal attack is when you attack someone based on something having nothing to do with the subject you are disputing, I have not done that. I have not said, \\"Sean had an affair with another woman other than his wife\\" or \\"Sean was caught stealing\\" or \\"Sean goes into gay bars,\\" I'm talking about his scientifically unethical behavior and biased way of doing science and interpreting scientific data: it deliberately ignores design, statistics, and pro-creation arguments which are backed up by endless evidence, the most obvious of which is DESIGN(it's all around you from the simplest we know of to the most complex we know of: the human body and MIND), design so complex it makes a random explosion and evolution and impossibility, living fossils (and evidence points towards everything being a living fossil, meaning nothing evolved), prophecy, and though prophecy is spiritual, it can be scientifically analyzed for accuracy just as a science prediction/hypothesis can be tested.<br /><br />Atheist-liberal science will always be bad science, it will always fulfill the verse from God, \\"ever learning but never coming to truth.\\"<br /><br />Google big bang contradictions, relativity contradictions and seek the truth.<br /><br />Update: Oh look, over a 100 liberals and Coast to Coast AM fans and students of Sean have voted this review down. You can't vote the truth down, reality doesn't work that way.<br /><br />12-03-2012:<br /><br />\\"But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.\\" - Ezekiel 3:7-9<br /><br />\\"And he brought me into the inner court of the house of Yahweh. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of Yahweh, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east. Then he said to me, \\"Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose. Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cryin my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.\\" - Ezekiel 8:16-18<br /><br />And lately, Israel has finally been acknowledging God as the reason they have a right to Canaan. The time God has allotted for the Gentile nations to be saved will be coming to a close, and you will all be shut out of God's kingdom and no amount of railing or wailing will get you in once you are locked out, which is what God demonstrated with Israel for thousands of years now, including with the Holocaust. One day, there will be a world wide Holocaust of the Gentiles, caused by themselves, Satan and then God.<br /><br />(Oh I see now I'm up to 800 votes down, that equals 32 classrooms of 25 students, yawn. Is that all you have angry deluded liberals who think you get to decide what is right and wrong, who think you can make baby murder good and child abuse good? How arrogant of you. No: you aren't God, there's more than one of you on top of that, there cannot be more than one God. You're anger, is futile).in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.\\" - Ezekiel 8:16-18<br /><br />And lately, Israel has finally been acknowledging God as the reason they have a right to Canaan.

B005NPCUC8|5.0|This cd is  outstanding, the remastered music has been kept true to its original integrity. I  would highly recommend this remastered version of this compact disc to pink floyd fans
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I really like the new Deftones album.  It seems like they put a lot of time and emotion into it and it really works.  Nice job guys!  If you like the Deftones, buy this album so they can keep on making great music!  Support artists you love.
B005F3XV7Q|5.0|Love the acting of the people and the animals in this movie.  It was great to be able to see who did what voice talents and I like having the two disc edition of it as well.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Who would have thought a steamy novel could have such strong funny parts. I am not a erotic novel fan but the hum or in the book made it enjoyable
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is my favorite new series to watch! It's adventurous, funny, and the story line addicting! The way the characters are introduced and woven around existing characters, make this show fun to watch. Just when you think you have it figured out, they throw you a curve ball!  I love Robert Carlyle as Rumpelstiltskin...he plays the role perfectly!
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|I have been a rather on-off fan of Lana's music. When I heard the single \\"Born to Die\\" on internet radio, at first I brushed the song off as a false hipster-type song. After a couple of listens, I became enamored by Lana's emotional impact in the songs and bought her entire BTD album. When 'Paradise' was released yesterday, I was so excited to buy it, and I am not at all disappointed. The haunting voice and melodies of BTD are enhanced and deepened in 'Paradise'.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|greet app I like it but there is no much of vidios to the wather . Ihope new virson of these app.
B00992CF6W|3.0|If you don't have a xbox360 or a Pc get the app.But if you have a xbox360 or a Pc get minecraft on one of thoose. (Pc:you get everything)(xbox360:you get more items than pocket edition)
0786891416|3.0|This is a spoof on a novel within a TV show.  It is exactly what I expected--cheesy and campy.  Should be an overall fun read (half read.)
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I got what i expected.....great time, packing and service.....The product is great, just what i needed for my home and portable recordings.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|One book of Philip K. Dick, that is incredible to say the least!  He left us all a library of great works!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app.! The hole screen becomes the calculator so it's a really nice large work area with big numbers , shows the calculations beautifuly , so easy to use and smooth to touch buttons . I'd highly recomend this to every one. So glad I tried it !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read the book before I watched the movie and I must say the book is way better than the movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|awesome game love the challenge cant wait for more levels. for me the only thing that needs fixed is the zoom. it doesnt stay zoomed out.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I thought the writing in Harry Potter was wonderful and I admire Rowling but I could not push myself past the first five chapters of this book. I was really disappointed.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Cute movie - loved the actors...Judi Dench, etc.  I thought while watching, I could never do that - go to India in a hotel<br />that needs help and retire....nice little story for everybody to watch.
B004LROUNG|1.0|little drama, weak characters, no surprises, take a pass on this one. his old stuff was far better, this is not the return other reviewers promise
B0067EKY7M|4.0|I chose 4 star because  it was a  nice film for family - nothing  too exciting, but a funny subject<br />love story for the gals - and fishing for the boys -
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This is an excellent communication handbook! Everyone can benefit from tips included in the book. I know some think the book is basic, however I personally am aware of many who have no clue about \\"The Basics\\". It is well written with numerous examples which anyone can understand. The author is an example of a true leader who inspires and does not control. Thank You!! Keep up the good work!!!
B00782O7IY|3.0|very unusual and in BxW - Dog was the star and again a simple story line and<br />I wasn't too excited about it all, but had to see it once because he won Oscars all over the place.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very interesting series.  These books are not only written well, the story line is great.  Men, don't miss out on what your ladies are reading!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This series isn't a typical read for me but I loved it!!!  I am now on the third book and have decided I won't see the movie until I've read all three.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I was about to turf my old MBP power adaptor from 2010 but them came across this - excellent, not my MB Air has a second power adaptor! $10 is a good price, not sure I would of paid full price for this.
B0026O475M|5.0|Really enjoyed watching Cast Away with my son.  He is 14 and really enjoyed it.  It was good to see how you can survive on practicially nothing.
B009329ZF2|2.0|So many cliches...so much time. Special effects were quite good. WWII vets added more substance than the actors. A fairly entertaining waste of time.
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|Good to have another Rebus story as I've always been a fan but if truth be told it just didn't satisfy. Hopefully more to come.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|this book was a waste of those hours of my life--just awful! I kept waiting for the plot to become interesting but it never happened.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I streamed this album before I bought it today...and I listed to the ENTIRE album.  I can't remember the last time I have done this, and after I listed to it once I listed to the ENTIRE album again...and did so every night thereafter until I was able to purchase it today.  My vote for ALBUM of the Year,!!! Best D'tones album to date, every single song so solid by themselves and together just about the greatest freaking thing I have every listed to.  Almost brings a tear to my eye when I get lifted in the utter emotional phantasmagorical ride dilivered by the band that made a huge comeback here!!
B002SSBD6W|5.0|Not just an informative novel (though it contains a wide variety of interesting and eye opening facts), Jonathan Safran Foer includes background stories, personal experiences and logical arguments that will have you thinking twice about the animals you eat.
B007SGM084|4.0|Very descriptive and  tantalizing. A great hearts and flowers romance story with a little bit of dom/sub thrown into the mixture.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great time killer. good for waiting rooms lol. and they basically give the points away! def a keeper
0446693804|5.0|Another heart warming book from Nicholas Sparks. I am a fan and have collected all his works. The books read fast and make good night time reading..
0316187216|3.0|I have been going back and forth on whether or not I find Red Country to be \\"original\\".<br />In a way it is original in the way he did things. On the other hand, he basically took 4 or 5 Clint Eastwood movies, slammed them into a montage and changed Clint Eastwood to \\"Lamb\\".<br /> For those who arent Clint Eastwood western movie fans, you probably wont even notice. I am a Clint Eastwood western movie fan so it was very, very easy to pick out.<br /> My first disappointment was the size of the book. It is the smallest hardback I have bought since New Spring.<br /> I enjoyed reading the book. There were some great scenes and great quotes. I am not sure how much I like the ending. I dont want to give any spoilers so..<br />*SPOILER* (why did our old friend pop in like that?).*END SPOILER* I get what Eastwood movie it referenced, and while it made a lot of sense in that movie, it made very little in this.<br /><br /> I was also disappointed there was no Lamb POV. He didnt come off as near the badass that he did in the trilogy.<br /><br /> So far I consider the Heroes to be Abercrombie's best work. It was very crafty and very entertaining. Followed by the trilogy that was a mixed bag, some parts were OUTSTANDING, some needing a little work, over all really good. I would put this above Best Served Cold which I wasnt blown away with.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|After twice seeing the movie I had to buy it for my collection. Judy Dench  and the other English actors allow you to feel how older people might feel left alone, lonely with limited income and yet full of adventure. Filmed in India , the scenery is outstanding
B000W93CHC|5.0|The book kept me sucked in with every page turn as all of the Ken Follett books I've read do.
B009B8YZKS|1.0|Has anyone watched this trailer? I just did to see what it is all going to be about, and can you say Starship Troopers? Don't get me wrong I love Halo but this looks like a total rip off of Starship Troopers. I would say rent this before buying. But again thats just my 2 cents.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I really liked seeing this movie especially seeing how the Avengers become the team that is seen in the comics. Also that they are able to save the planet from annihilation Loki.  I also liked that the team was able to come together and wanted to protect the planet after the danger was gone.  The team did lose a valuable member of their team which is the turning point for them to work together and become what they were meant to be \\"The Avengers.\\"
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved the book. I normally don't read at all but this book has a combination of different aspects of the book to keep your attention. A must read.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|they are adorable the pigs I mean its just so cute you put them in there little carts and planes it I s so cute
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I guess i was confused about the identity of the tiger. I wanted to believe the tiger was real but by the end of the story it seemed rather unlikely. I wanted to know what the author was really trying to say.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|This was the 1st book in the series....didn't know there were even any out there.  I love the Dexter series.  Will be buying the 2nd one soon.
B005LAIH54|5.0|This movie came to me in very good condition.I have the first part and it would be dumb not to have the rest of the story.it is agreat story and again Sam Worthington did a great job playing his part.
0345803493|4.0|I had read book 1 in the series of 3 so I wanted to see how the story progressed. I liked it better than book 1. It was entertaining.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|First off,I have been a loyal Aerosmith fan since I first saw them live back in the early 70's.<br />I have not purchased the album but just listening to the previews was painful.I'll wait until this one hits the bargain bin at Wal-Mart and go listen to \\"Rocks\\" again !!
B00136JS12|5.0|I've worn out many a copies of this album, & now I can take it anywhere! A good time, good vibe album, Boston RULES!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|its fun at first but gets repetitive and not free when you run out of diamonds and coins and such.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Good concept, fun to play. Runs smoothly but its a bit of a drain on my battery, which is doubly problematic with the game  starting upon booting. (The rest of the permissions are NOT a big issue. Lots of FAOTD reviewers seem to be overly sensitive about intrusive &amp; excessive permissions. Data mining does happen but its possible to take this paranoia too far, ya know! No need to give one star ratings to otherwise excellent apps because it has a couple permissions.)<br /><br />For some reason this app only takes up 50% of the screen available on my Coby Kyros MID 7042. I'd rate this game 5 stars if it weren't for that &amp; the speed my battery gets depleted. I only see myself playing this game only every once &amp; a while so the game starting when I boot up then running in the background umecesarily just uses up much needed resources.<br /><br /> Definately give this game a try while its still free. I played for a couple hours after I downloaded it, completely engrossed in bouncing the jellyfish around to finish the puzzles. Had to force myself to put it down.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|best thing i'v ever seen for minecraft wooooooooooo i thingk you shood get this i can finaly get bedrock and obsidon
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it has more mobs like werewolfs bears etc. i have the kindle fire hd and the screen is upsidedown and the controls are not as good as minecraft though it a good copy, the graphics are pretty good, its nice to have bigger maps
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Wat a book,well written,kept me interested,I felt I was right there with them just watching there survival,amazing book,well worth my time.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I kept waiting for something to grab my attention, but was constantly disappointed. All the sex stuff was way to over the top and after awhile I was thoroughly bored.
B006NXICT4|5.0|I was so addicted,couldn't put the book down,written well and enjoyed it,best ever I have read,just too good to put down.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Steig Larrson was such a gifted writer, I am sorry we won't hear more from him.  I love this series, have read all three books three times and will re-read again I am sure.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B009LA1QW6|3.0|I guess  I can say I'm glad that this is an EP and not a full-out album. Paradise is pretty experimental and differs quite greatly from Born to Die. This is good and bad. On one hand you have newer songs with newer sounds on the other hand you have some pretty fierce filler.<br /><br />1) Ride 5/5 - A promising new direction for her sound. Its exciting but still has her signature melancholy style.<br /><br />2) American 4/5 - American really reinforces her whole \\"I'm American\\" theme. References to Bruce Springstein and Elvis? Pretty efficient and melodic, I'd say. Unlike...<br /><br />3) Cola 2/5 - Cola...hmm. Okay, Lana Del Rey is no stranger to shock value. Her music videos point that out. But whereas some of her themes are edgy, Cola verges on flat out vulgar. I'm no prude. Radio was one of my favorites. Its just that Cola seems to try way too hard to be edgy.<br /><br />4) Body Electric 3/5 - Starts getting back to the Lana of Born to Die. A more fast paced but atmospheric song. I'd put it somewhere between Born to Die and Off to the Races. My only beef here is that it's terribly repetitive in a way that's worse than Summertime Sadness.<br /><br />5) Blue Velvet 5/5 - YES. Now we're back to Lana. Blue Velvet is absolutely perfect. Mixing a classic favorite but giving it enough umph to be more than just a cover. Lana practically makes the song hers. If anything, I hoped this one would be longer. Its only about 2 minutes long.<br /><br />6) Gods and Monsters 4/5 - Gods and Monsters feels like a better version of Cola. It has the spiritual theme Lana seems to be toying with but its executed in a much better fashion. Though it does have some vulgarity, it feels natural and doesn't sound trashy or beneath her.<br /><br />7) Yayo 3/5 - Yayo was already released back when Lana Del Rey was using the name Elizabeth Grant (Lizzy grant? I don't remember.) Its a good song but the original mix is definitely a 4 whereas this one falls a bit short. You'd have to listen for yourself. Filler for sure.<br /><br />8) Bel Air - 2/5 - Filler in the complete sense of the word. Bel Air is overly atmospheric and lacks any kind of theme that screams \\"LANA!\\". I can't help but feel I've heard Bel Air before (and done in a better way) by Enya. Its basically and Enya song that feels so out of place and just slapped on the end.<br /><br />I love Lana Del Rey's music. Born to Die was one of the most refreshing albums in recent memory. Its a hard album to top. Luckily, I don't think Paradise set out to do so. She's experimenting with different themes and subjects and sounds and that's pretty cool but there's bound to be some repetition. I can't stress enough how glad I am that this is only an EP. Be sure to take multiple listens. This may very well be an a la carte purchase. Here's to a new EP and what hopefully is a test path to a second great album
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Amazingly, this show not only keeps going, but manages to get better.  Loving how easy it is to get this through amazon and unbox also
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great information for anyone wanting to get healthier. No BS, Mike isn't pushing any products. Looking foreward to using his program.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Super funny movie with awesome acapella music, and the soundtrack is just as good including all the good songs from the movie. The songs aren't exactly the same as the movie, but still real good. I wish they would have included the movie version of \\"Cups\\" the way Anna Kendrick sung it on stage, because its more personal and beautiful, but still, awesome soundtrack.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|What a fun movie!  Wes Anderson, director of one of my favs The Royal Tenenbaums, puts together another great movie with exceptional performances from Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand.  Not to mention the two lead kids, who really bring the innocence of the times to life.  :-)

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love Grisham!!  This was hard to put down, I think one of his best.  Great twist, surprising intricate story telling this time.  Did not want it to end so abruptly...
B00000JNO1|5.0|Leave it to Florida boys. With 3 full time guitar players,Leon back on bass,and new drummer Artie Pyle, the band cranks it up and lets it RIP! A must for any Skynyrd fan or for those not familiar with these guys. You won't be disappointed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is a fantastic port to android. I have tried different versions of Spider and this is very smooth and fast and FUN!
140120841X|4.0|Good read, certainly is food for thought about today's society.  Many parallels with today's government and peoples attitudes. Would recommend it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is a fun game...very addictive.  There's always new content being added.  It is not necessary to purchase content to play...although breeding for certain dragons takes a lot of patients.  The social aspect is what you make of it.  I enjoy visiting neighbors...and leaving short messages.  I have other friends who only send gold &amp; maps...and do not visit at all.  Either way, you can still continue to play.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Egan's novel is entertaining and an easy read.  The story interweaves the lives of a variety<br />of people as they go from youth to middle-age and beyond.  The music industry plays a prominent part, as does rebellion.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another wonderfully written attorney based story of a failed court/prosecution matter that to the reader's delight, turns to a fascinating twist and turn of delightful revenge.
030758836X|4.0|I found this to be an entertaining read. Some of the twists I could see coming in advance, and some did surprise me, but either way it kept me interested and reading. I don't want to give anything away but I always enjoy reading complex, devious characters. The ending didn't bother me and it seemed fitting in my opinion, though that's not the way I would have handled things if I were in the main character's position. Anyway, I enjoyed it. Now I plan to read Dark Places which I picked up at the airport forever ago and never read.

0061906220|5.0|Pete the cat is a great book for young children. Due to predictability and repetitive nature of the words this is a must read for your kids. Remember it is an act of fiction so results may vary in real life situations
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The artistry of Susan's VOICE and the way she uses it on this CD is incredible!  At the present, I can't isolate a \\"favorite\\".  Each one of these songs is unique and memorable - from her low smokey tones to her pure, crystal bell tones.  Susan is flawless!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This was a must have because its a very awesome show.  We hunted all over for a good price and amazon had it.  As a prime member, I couldn't beat the free shipping either.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl keeps the reader rapt: you just want to keep reading to find out what became of this clever, beautiful couple who started out thier charmed life full of promise, buoyed along by their obvious compatibility.  Surely they could weather a reversal of fortune, even if it's so drastic that it alters everything about their circumstances.  But when the wife goes missing on their fifth wedding anniversary, we learn all sorts of things about the husband we'd rather not believe were true.  I couldn't put it down.
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|Great example of John Mayers carrer maturation.  John Mayer is a wonderful artist and this is a great start to your collection.
159420411X|5.0|Wonderful book. For those of you who are new to Nate Silver, you are in for a treat. I've followed him since before the 2008 elections, long before the New York Times picked up his blog (538[dot]com). He's the most insightful (and accurate) election analyst and prognosticator I've discovered to date.
B009LL4LMM|1.0|The app has an interesting premise with that cartoon feel from your childhood puzzling games. However the permissions this game has like starting at boot, wifi and network access. If the dev wanted thus game with it's permissions to have a real shot at succeeding they should have at least stated why those perms were included. Adding fake reviews to get a higher rating didn't help. Fix the perms and people will actually give it a second look, otherwise better get back to the cartoons in hopes they can reel in some mega suckers after this app isn't the FAOTD.
1423140591|5.0|This book is more than I can possibly describe. This book is so good I read in less than one weekend. I was so anxious to reed it that i totally forgot to clean my house that weekend. Riordan wrote yet another amazing book with great characters and awsome storyline, old friends came back and new ones were made. I cant wait to read the mark of athena.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I am another of the many disappointed fans here.  I didnt fall in love with friends from watching it on tv.  Everyone around me seemed to love the show so I just skipped watching on tv an bought the 1st and maybe 2nd season to see if I'd like it.  Friends almost instantly became my favorite sitcom ever and i bought the rest of the seasons the day they came out.  I have only really seen friends episodes on my DVDs, so I only know the episodes with the uncut scenes/lines in them.  Until I saw this Blu-Ray set and saw the reviews and comments I didn't even know these lines and scenes were added for the DVDs, so for me the uncut versions are the original.  I went from excited and ready to buy, to angry and not buying in a matter of seconds.  The only reason I can think of as to why Warner bros did this is that the audience they chose to appeal to with this set are the fans that don't already own the DVDs.  I took a look at that site someone pointed out showing all the lines you won't have, hoping it was dumb stuff I wouldn't notice.  No way!  There are very funny lines and even entire scenes that I can't imagine not being there!  I will happily pay more for this set if Warner fixes it.  I am hoping that this is all reaching Warner and they do something about it.  If it is just some bad reviews here on amazon it may not reach them.
B0045XICB2|5.0|pretty good movie. Good action. a joy to be able to order it via my tv and have it load quickly.
0345803507|5.0|The beginning of the book was slow but once you get into it a little more...your hubby will love you. This book is a great sex therapy book for anyone. But for you very modest women it might not be your kind of story. It absolutely brought out the sexy animal in me!!!

B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not much explanation of how the 2 murders in this story are connected. Story felt forced although on the pkus side less of it is Scarpettas internal doubts/churn than the last book.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Great to finally catchup with Harry Hole's start. Great look at Sydney in the late 1990's, especially the long closed but famous gay icon of Sydney's Oxford St, the Aubury Hotel. Accurate depiction of Australian 's conflicted attitude and relationship with it's indigenous population. A few minor geographic, suburb issues but overall great fun.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This is not one of Patricia Cornwell's best.  The novel doesn't have the excitement that they usually do.  This is almost a recap of the characters, who did not \\"grow.\\"  There are no new relevations about the people who are involved in her Scarpetta novels.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This film, I must give five claws up.<br /><br />My first impression of Brave was visual- the animation effects at times for the backgrounds had me wondering if actual footage was used and the eyes of the mother bear were the most human in the film.<br /><br />And then the story began to unfold. This is undoubtedly a Disney take on the themes in Celtic folklore where a transformation into an animal as part of the spiritual journey, in this case, a she-bear. She-bears are known as symbols of motherhood as well as strength and wisdom, protectors of their young.<br />This is a coming of age story for young women and mothers. Young Merida wants to live her own life and not the one she believes her mother, Eleanor wants her to live. As both face the dilemma caused by Merida's desire, they find the deeper truth of their relationship.<br /><br />This is a welcome change of pace in Disney's \\"heroic\\" films, where the heroism and bravery isn't about physical strength or ability, but of the emotional.<br /><br />Pixar again is where Disney shines best.
0374531269|5.0|I saw Ishmeal Beah in the History Channel and watched what horrible things that occurred on the other side of the world.  Can't wait to read his life story.  Everyone should be thankful for what they have and not take it for granted.
B009AZZ6H8|4.0|When Soundgarden went gently into that good night back in 1997, they left behind a genre in decay. With Nirvana and, to a lesser extent, Alice In Chains effectively out of commission, the reigns of the grunge kingdom were unwittingly handed over to a new breed of third-tier also-rans. Afterall, it was all too apparent at the time that Pearl Jam -- the last man standing by default -- wanted nothing to do with it. To put it into perspective: when they retired, nobody knew much about Creed and absolutely nobody knew what a Nickelback was. To say Soundgarden have \\"Been Away For Too Long\\" would be an understatement. When they reunited on New Year's Day in 2010, it was a sigh of relief for fans of rock music in general, as one of the icons from a bygone era had returned to perhaps set things right.<br /><br />Setting things right they certainly have. Thankfully, \\"King Animal,\\" their first piece of new music in 15 years finds the group in fine form, barely missing a beat since \\"Down On the Upside\\" was released. Though time hasn't been too kind to Chris Cornell's pipes (or his solo career, for that matter), the man still gets down and dirty, roughing it up on \\"Non-State Actor\\" and the very \\"Badmotorfinger\\"-esque \\"Attrition\\" (a personal favorite) while oozing enough soul on \\"Bones of Birds\\" and \\"Rowing\\" to balance it out. Truly, this is Cornell's finest and most fired-up performance in a good while. Likewise, the band sound like they have been charging their batteries this whole time, coming out of the gate with a flawless performance boasting little nuances and musical oddities that reveal themselves upon repeat listening.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning, as a matter of fact, that the album as a whole will take a few spins before it can fully be appreciated. On the surface and upon first listen, these songs sound like middle-of-the-road rock and that can be disheartening to the die-hards that have been waiting for this release with baited breath. Rest assured that there are a number of tracks here that get better the more they bury themselves into your head and when you stack any of these songs against whatever passes for modern-rock these days, they completely annihilate the competition.<br /><br />So how does \\"King Animal\\" stack up against previous Soundgarden releases? Well, to compare it to genuine classics such as \\"Badmotorfinger\\" and \\"Superunknown\\" would be unfair. As far as comeback albums from bands that have been apart for well over a decade, it's definitely a standout. If \\"King Animal\\" is the band finding their sea legs and adapting to a new climate (on both the creative and business end), then the follow-up promises to be even better. Bottom line is, \\"King Animal\\" rips and rocks like few rock albums do these days and reassures us that Soundgarden are truly rock royalty.e a number of tracks here that get better the more they bury themselves into your head and when you stack any of these songs against whatever passes for modern-rock these days, they completely annihilate the competition.<br /><br />So how does \\"King Animal\\" stack up against previous Soundgarden releases?

B009ERK1T0|5.0|Like a good cheese or a fine wine, Deftones just keep getting better with age. Maybe it's a sense of pride in the fact that they have outlived many trends in rock music or perhaps it's the newfound resolve the band acquired when bassist Chi Cheng was put out of commission in late 2008 following a car wreck that left him comatose. Whatever it is, it's working. While most bands their age are slowing down, Deftones seem to be prolonging their prime.<br /><br />Like 2010's \\"Diamond Eyes,\\" the seventh offering from Sacramento's finest, \\"Koi No Yokan,\\" throws in all the dynamics that made the group so special when they first arrived on the scene nearly two decades ago and delivers a highly refined and tightened sound with little fat to spare. With producer Nick Raskulinecz (Coheed & Cambria, Alice in Chains) once again in their pocket, Deftones deliver yet another home-run. Opening with the adrenaline rush of \\"Swerve City\\" and merging ever so slightly into the lush ambience of \\"Romantic Dreams,\\" it is apparent that the group is once again on top of their game, inspired and intensely focused. Nowhere is this more evident than on deeper album cuts and instant classics such as the beautifully dense \\"Rosemary\\" and the appropriately creepy and aggressive \\"Poltergeist.\\"<br /><br />While admittedly less aggressive than past offerings, \\"Koi No Yokan\\" makes up for what it lacks in heaviness with heaps of intensity and ambience. Frontman Chino Moreno screams a lot less than on any album before, but the trade off is an emotionally charged and moody performance that serves as a highlight of the frontman's career. True to form, Stephen Carpenter's riffs still buzz through the woodwork, drilling the songs into your head almost instantly. Likewise, Abe Cunningham proves once again why he is one of the most criminally under-rated drummers of his era with a performance that is technically impressive and consistent, and yet, serves the songs perfectly well without showing off. One would also be remiss if they didn't mention bassist Sergio Vega and his contributions to the group. While Cheng is certainly missed, Vega has almost effortlessly blended into the band, proving to be the perfect match. What we have in Deftones circa 2012 is a band that has been around the block a few times and knows how to create music that their fans want to hear without repeating themselves.<br /><br />Nowhere on this album is there a clunker or something that doesn't feel like it fits. Much like \\"Diamond Eyes,\\" this is a seamlessly perfect Deftones album from front to back. It's hard to imagine the band that put out \\"Adrenaline\\" becoming the band they have become, but Deftones have survived the years with grace and creative fire to spare. Even though it's sad that the band are enjoying a renewed sense of purpose while Cheng remains out of commission, it's rather remarkable given all they've been up against that they've remained this consistent and interesting for so long. Longtime fans and newcomers alike will find much to relish in \\"Koi No Yokan,\\" an album whose title roughly means \\"Anticipation of love.\\" So put on the headphones, turn out the lights, and prepare to fall in love all over again.so be remiss if they didn't mention bassist Sergio Vega and his contributions to the group.

B002MFX0RQ|5.0|After all these years, I was pleased to find that my joyful memory of the film was solid. I had not realized that James Stewart had performed the role of Elwood P. Doud on stage in addition to on flim. I'm pleased that<br />the liner notes included this information in the package. Jesse White had a distinguished career as a Character Actor, and his role in \\"Harvey\\" was another example of his art. I'm glad that no one saw fit to \\"colorize\\" the film.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I was introduced to Lee Child and Jack Reacher via a sale on Amazon. I am now hooked on the Jack Reacher series and will begin reading them, one by one. Starting now with the second in his series. In this case, \\"giving\\" the book away for $1.99 will make Amazon plenty from me, as I will now have to buy the remaining 30+ books at full retail. Nice job, Amazon, great marketing. As to the book itself, it started off a bit slow, as the author spent well needed time to introduce his character to us. I enjoyed all the twists and turns that the book took on its way to the end. Lee Child was able to throw in suspense, romance, detective work, and good old fashion action, making this a very good book to read.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I hadn't realized how little I knew about Google, as a company and as a set of technologies.  For me it was a page turner - it's true I'm interested in technology in the world, but I've not worked in this industry. The people come to life, and Google is painted as a company in full. This isn't a puff piece or a hatchet job.  I highly recommend it.
B0013E5HEG|5.0|Durable and well detailed. I was looking for a lion for my son since he is enjoying the Chronicles of Narnia. This toy fit the bill perfectly.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|There are some early reports of pressing issues with this set, and indeed my copy of \\"Abbey Road\\" has got many problems, not least of which are some serious scuffing in the dead wax and an overall appearance akin to a used record. And sure enough it is very noisy -- defective output from the pressing plant, most likely. Online conversations suggest I'm not alone.<br /><br />Now, with that out of the way, and assuming that gets resolved, this is a lovely set. The box and book are beautiful, the cover art all well done.<br /><br />Most important, how do the masters sound? And where do they come from? There is some misinformation circulating about the sources, including claims that the vinyl records are transfers from CD. That is not the case. The transfers were made from unlimited 24-bit, 44.1kHz files which were the parent, so to speak, of the CD files, but the key difference is the lack of limiting that was felt to be necessary for the CD release. Tech specs aside, how do the records sound (at least those that are not defective)? Terrific, in my opinion -- excellent detail and clear bass. Sean Magee, the Abbey Road engineer responsible for the transfer, has stated that the intent was to replicate the sound of the original tapes, not necessarily the sound of the original LP releases, which would have been made with compression so that they could \\"compete\\" with other pop music in circulation at the time. I've never heard the original tapes of course, so I can't compare, but these cuts do sound true.<br /><br />To sum up, assuming I can get a clean copy of my favorite album, this should work out wonderfully. For anyone like me, a fan of the band not already possessed of older, beloved vinyl versions of the albums, this is something you'll love to have.<br /><br />EDIT: Please be sure to check out the comments thread below, where some other Amazon members have posted some very helpful information on the sources for various issues of the remasters, thoughts on this vinylissue, etc. Thanks Amazon friends.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I believed that the content of this book will mean differently to different age group of readers.<br /><br />For me, I see myself progressively moving to be like Victor though that will take me another 40 over years.  However, I can see myself not wanting to grow old and want to maintain my state (of body, mind, healthy & looks) at my prime.<br /><br />I love the part when the authors indicates &#34;Heaven meets Earth&#34; whereby stalactite from the top and bottom growth to a razor's edge of each other to from one column.  It just shows the look of an hour glass (if one can imagine the image) that associates the essence of time.<br /><br />There is also a relationship of time and God (of any religion) in this novel which i find interesting and apt in doing so since the power comes from the ability to control.  Most of us (if not all) knows that only God knows what is lies ahead of us and whether we are &#34;attuned&#34; to His wise words for guidance.  I found this part theologically interesting.<br /><br />Another part of this novel taught one to cherish and be contented... &#34;We all yearn for what we have lost. But sometimes, we forget what we have.&#34;  So many things that we take for granted, we cannot break ourselves from this old habit of complaining and not showing more appreciation and gratitude.<br /><br />There are a number of learning points from this book.  Trust me,  we interpret differently at different times and this book is worth a keep.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Although Grisham is always a good read, I found the plot a bit far fetched.  He admitted in the Epilogue that he did little research and relied on fiction. Maybe his success has made him lazy. I appreciate it when a novelist spends the time to get the facts right. e.g. FBI Directors are appointed by the President, they serve a 10 year term and don't rise through the organization as stated in the book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am not a devoted Grisham follower, but have read several of his books. This one is tops in my opinion!!!
B005PK553C|5.0|I love this show, it has to be one of the best TV shows I have ever seen. The story is creepy, visually amazing and the acting is spot on.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another awesome Reacher adventure!<br /><br />My hero!<br />Recommended for anyone who loves to feel the suspense and read straight through without stopping.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It reminded me of his older books.  Not that his most recent books haven't been great, but I could put them down at night, but this one had me wanting to keep reading to figure out what was going to happen next.

It is a good story with great visuals and fun to watch though it is sad in parts.  I would recommend to anyone who has kids that like fairies, magic, the seasons, nature, etc.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is so easy to read, that i will always read his stuff.  This was a good story, basically in 2 parts.  It starts well and ends well. It will keep you guessing, but I like to brag, i did figure out the ending.

B008458O3S|5.0|As the title says, the game crashes with an \\"Unfortunately&hellip;\\" immediately after opening. I don't get anything else at all.<br /><br />Galaxy Nexus, Android 4.2.<br /><br />It seems that version 1.5 that's on the Google Play store solves this problem.  Why do we not have that upgrade on Amazon Appstore yet?<br /><br />(This was finally fixed, but it took a long time, and the Amazon App Store application not only didn't inform me of the update, but didn't let me upgrade.  I had to delete the app and reinstall to get the new version.)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very entertaining. has some glitches,  but nothing to severe to prevent you from enjoying the game. yes there is the always present push to get the player to spend real cash for some rare items, parents. beware. the rest of us, don't be so gullible !

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This movie is visually nice to watch but the story is slow and even I wanted to kill the human.  It was hard for me to get into and I was looking forward to seeing it.  If you are bored, this movie is okay to watch.

I do not recall the installation being particularly tough in our Antec NSK4480B case.<br /><br />After losing power in Hurricane Sandy, I heard a loud grinding noise when trying to power up our computer.  It turned out to be the fan of this cooler.  I later read in a review of this product that CM is reasonable to deal with.  I am happy to agree with this, having just finished an online chat with a CM rep.  I will receive within a week or so at no cost to me a replacement fan.<br /><br />Thus, I highly recommend this product.

I still got to keep playing. But I accidentally fell down again. I kept doing so-so I covered it up. You most likely wont dig a 600 block deep hole. So I still regimend this app but be careful of ways to die.

0985081821|3.0|More of a 3.5 star.<br /><br />Good world building, I enjoyed the writing style, excellent for a first time author. Potential for a 4 star but lacked character development and proper explanation of character connections. Some elements of the story could have been fleshed out a bit more, and the story jumped unexpectedly at times.<br /><br />Although it was an intriguing story for the most part, some of the realisations of Sophia's abilities were anti-climactic, big build up and then the characters inexplicably just accepted what was happening and carried on, which was totally unrealistic. Also, the advanced technology being used by the cruor came out of no where and needed some dedicated paragraphs or even a chapter to establish a proper link.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book, I'll buy the next one in the series, I'm just not as invested in the characters as I would like to be. It's a really tough genre to get into, since its been done so many times but the author gave it a good shot. I wish I could give it the extra half star here, I feel bad giving 3 as it was more than just 'OK'. This author has the potential to be great.

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I could not open my Kindle because the USB Cable I was using did not continue to work.  The new cable works fine.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|the only problems with this app are it gets really hard after the first 100ish puzzles so in other words they're really easy (too easy) in the beginning then they get really hard all of a sudden??? also you accomplishments arent saved if you accidentally un-download the app :p mildly annoying
0345803493|4.0|After feeling that the first novel of the Fifty Shades trilogy was so overrated, I was a little nervous about reading the second story. Oddly, though, this one was a lot better. I really did enjoy this one. There were a lot of problems with it, but for some very weird reason it was enjoyable.<br /><br />There was a lot of repetition. In the same way that Stephenie Meyer seemed obsessed with the word chagrin, it seems that E.L. James is obsessed with using \\"my sex\\" in just about every sex scene. Since the books are mainly sex and innuendo, that means that almost every other page seemed to have that term.<br /><br />It was nice that James finally explained more about Christian's background, but it was still kind of lacking in that department, especially considering the ending. It seems like any person with the slightest bit of logic wouldn't move in with a person that they really know nothing about and have only been with for a few weeks. And it was nice to see that Christian is a better person than he seemed to be in the first novel. He's still completely broken and in need of more frequent and more intensive therapy, but he's a better, more compassionate person.<br /><br />Clearly this is not going to win prizes for best book ever or be remembered as a great literary masterpiece, but Fifty Shades Darker was intriguing enough that I didn't want to put it down until I finished. It was also intriguing enough that I wanted to go ahead and read the final novel in the series. I still think that the trilogy is very overrated, but it is a bit of mindless fun, if you can get over some of the more annoying issues that exist in it.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Great vocals, amazing songs, Xtina is back!!! Its different from past albums amd makes you feel really good. Her voice is still powerful and back with a vengeance!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|My husband bought this book.  He was really interested to read it and finally bought it.  It was the first book he actually finished and loved.  He didn't want it to end.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I was hoping it was a downloadable Bible for my phone.  The verbal play feature is greatly used but very slow in loading.  I don't like the fact that it's using my data usage. Reading it is fine; the text is clear and adjustable in size and background color. The reading plans are a great idea!  Thanks for those.
B006QKJQM6|4.0|I loved the first movie so I definitely wanted to watch this one too. It didn't disappoint-- very cute animated film and good storyline. I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was interesting but not as \\"exciting\\" as I anticipated it would be.  Definitely not an \\"edge of your seat\\" suspense. But it did set the record straight over what we heard on the news networks.  I have the utmost respect for the men who volunteer for this type of duty. They are definitely a breed apart.  True \\"Alpha Males\\".  Curiously, I still question why the DoD was thinking of prosecuting the author.  I didn't read anything I would consider \\"top secret\\", \\"secret\\" or \\"confidential\\".  Nor did I feel any disclosed informationn in this novel would cause \\"grave damage\\" to the security of the US government.  The War on Terror made it absolutely essential that bin Laden be killed, not captured. And bin Laden's later burial at sea ensured his crazed followers had no shrine to gravitate too.  OBL is dead.  He deserved his fate. May he rot in hell.  Kudos to US Navy SEAL Team 6 for a job well done.
0345803507|4.0|After the semi-disappointment that was the first Fifty Shades novel and the semi-redemption by the second, I went full-speed ahead into Fifty Shades Freed. It was much better than the first and about equal with the second. The series still reads a lot like bad or mediocre fanfiction, but it addictive bad or mediocre fanfiction.<br /><br />The intercut nature of the first part of the book was interesting. It sort of gave an insight to what had been going on in the lives of Christian and Ana. It was a little distracting sometimes going back and forth between the pre-wedding/during-the-wedding stuff and the honeymoon. If I got the least bit distracted, I would sometimes have to go back and remind myself which time period the current scene was in.<br /><br />This novel finally allowed the characters to become more than just the sketches that they'd basically been since the beginning. There was not only a growth in the development of their personalities, there was also a growth in the level of trust and intimacy between Christian and Ana. This story felt more like an actual novel than the other two had, but it was still quite flawed.<br /><br />There was still a massive amount of repetition in the novels, which was frustrating. It was something I started getting used to after a while.<br /><br />As for the trilogy as a whole, I actually wish the stories had been better and had been worth the hype. Though I enjoyed them, it saddens me that there was such a level of hype for books that weren't any better than they were. If only society could pay more attention to more worthy books. I don't regret reading these, but I do regret that people thought that these were awesome.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are page turners for sure.  I ready all 3 in a weekend.  It was nice to be able to get them all together.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I have not gotten it yet but have played it on friend's aneroid so cute and adorable!!!!I wish it were free Though...... oh well.....
B009YG2ND8|5.0|i love it it awsome i think everyone should give it five stars ya its fiften bucks but remember ita a real final fantasy
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I have 4 kids who are between 3-8 yrs. old; we all enjoyed the movie. Pixar has always made better movies than Disney, in my opinion.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|The music on this soundtrack has a very different tone than previous soundtracks for the Twilight Saga. Very enjoyable even though it's different.
B006LSZECO|2.0|E-books offer many advantages, but what do you do when you want to throw a book? You can't throw your iPad!<br />Early on I felt manipulated by the plot and came to dislike the characters, nearly all of them. But the page-turning quality and the hope that I was going to be surprised, enlightened, or at least provoked by the outcome kept me going. The cynicism and the preposterousness of the story led to a conclusion even more cynical and preposterous. I was provoked all right, but I had no outlet, no paper to throw. So let me just say: find something much more worth your time!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my freind max was playing this app i saw and played and love so like keep repeting it!!!!!!! lol i love love love love lovvvve it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this to read during a upcoming storm and was pulled into the story so fast that I had to buy the next two before the storm came!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Just started playing this game. The dragons are really cute and fun. It seems to take a lot of time to earn enough money to do some things. Hoping that changes as my level increases.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun game to play and makes you use your brain.  I wish the tiles were larger and there is definitely more space on the screen to do so.
B002PNF8HK|4.0|Had a very good storyline, but very creepy at the same time. I still talk about this movie after weeks of seeing it. It's a must see.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flyhnn is one of my favorite authors, and I have read every one of his books.  They  never disappoint.  I'm reading it now, and am very happy to find Mitch Rapp in action, along with his friend, Nash.  They work well together.  I can't wait to finish it.  My only complaint is the books don't come fast enough.<br /><br />I was devastated to learn Vince had health problems, and hope they are all taken care of by now.  I first became aware of him on Glenn Beck's program when he was introduced with his first book.  He was such a handsome, well mannered man that I couldn't wait for the first book, and will continue to buy them as fast as they come out.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is quite possibly the funniest movie to come out since the glory days of Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and the Zucker brothers. Matt & Trey (the creators of South Park) are at their absolute finest in this amazing satire. This movie has all of the brilliant elements of South Park, but it takes them all to the next level. This movie has its fair share of bathroom & bedroom humor, but all of the jokes revolving around these two subjects are well placed & are part of the satire. Most importantly they don't overwhelm the movie by going non-stop like say &#34;Superbad.&#34; However, as you would expect with Matt & Trey, the make fun of anything and everything: Muslim stereotypes (they are making fun of the stereotypes people have about muslims, not muslims themselves), foreign dictators, Hollywood celebraties, certain action movies, and it even parodies typical bathroom & bedroom humor itself.  In many aspects, Team America could be considered a musical because all of the songs that are sung are absolutely hysterical. The last time I laughed this hard at a song was when I heard &#34;White & Nerdy&#34; by Weird Al Yankovich. Lastly, this movie features puppets, which bear the brunt of the jokes (if it were done by a pupppet), but that shouldn't deter you from watching this movie at all, seeing as the technical aspects are done to perfection.<br /><br />However, with a movie with this much adult content, I have to put in a disclaimer: do not watch if you are offended by lots of f-bombs or very crude sexual humor.<br /><br />This movie is a genuine comedic masterpiece and it should not be missed unless you fall under the disclaimer.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|It was entertaining. Worth watching. Love Matt and Channing. Little long though. Could have cut out a bit of stuff.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I have seen this movie and comparing with so much trash movies out there in the zone how this one can only get 3 stars after 518 reviews ? This is a fine 5 star movie and Liam Neeson is a great actor. It`s a must see adrenaline rush 5 stars movie !
B000OVLIQU|5.0|Geoff Emerick does a great job relating his story about his time with The Beatles, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable read. I will certainly read it again in several months time. My only problem with the book is that Emerick seems to have a rather noticeable bias towards McCartney and against Lennon, Harrison, and Starr. He especially seems to have a problem with Harrison, but is more complacent with Lennon, and almost indifferent about Ringo. However, this is Emerick's book about his experiences, so it's not really something I can truly criticize. I do wish that he had done a better job about explaining his relations with the other Beatles though.<br /><br />9.0/10, will read again
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have a hard time finding books that keep my attention.  This book (Kindle), I carried with me everywhere.  I read it while I cooked dinner, while I waited in line at a gas station, etc...  I thought this was a book for teenagers but as a 38 year old woman I really enjoyed it.  I would highly reoommend this book to everyone!
B004MYF4SS|4.0|A glimpse into island life. Never ending twists and turns into entwinned relationships. Keeps you on tiptoe till the last full stop.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Ever since I saw him in Brisco County Jr., I've been a big fan of Bruce Campbell. I guess this movie was made even before that series was, but that doesn't matter now. This is one of the funniest movies ever made! If you don't find yourself stealing some of the lines in this movie to insert into your everyday dialog, then you need to take some lessons in stealing! It never hurt Milton Berle.<br /><br />Can't recommend this any higher. If I could give it 6 stars, I'd give it 7 stars!
B005LZZMRK|5.0|This is a great album that pays homage to progressive classics of the seventies while preserving its own identity. One of my favorites is Sectarian which borrows freely from some of the conventions of King Crimson; bass chords, quirky syncopations, ascending minor key transitions, all masterfully blended into an individual statement. Another favorite is Deform to Form a Star which seems to be a tip of the hat to The Moody blues, with mellotron, flute, jazzy guitar flourishes, and harmonic yet subtle vocals.<br /><br />My only criticism might be that some of the lyrics seem a bit contrived and the vocals can seem over produced in an Alan Parson's kind of way. But these are minor criticisms and would not prevent me from buying this album. In fact, I look forward to more music from these talented musicians.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|I know it's just me but I have CalenGoo on both my phone and Kindle Fire HD and for the life of me, I can't get them to sync.  It seems to want to go to my Hotmail account but I don't use that calendar.  What a mess!!  Not blaming the app -- maybe I'm too old to catch on!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Such a great app to get ideas and information on anything you can think of!!! I use it for everything, especially craft, holiday or gift ideas. Love the boards to... Perfect to keep ideas and subjects organized.
B00006F7S4|5.0|A haunting masterpiece; a record I've listened to continually since it came out (10 years ago); a perfect compilation; the pinnacle in its class; raw human emotion; a gem; a definer; untouchable; a perfect record.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome. But what makes it unique is the fact that its more then 1 game. its actually about a hundred. so try the games cause they can be fun. and it also gives you lots of points for almost no reason.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|Too much softporn among immature people barely interrupted by serious people or history. Wouk and Michener write much superior historical novels. I didn't finish reading the book.
