B00JW5RZOS|5|Perfect, I had bought one before.
B00CJYKXJI|5|My son loves these pajamas!
B005SW558W|1|I had these on for 3 hours and they ripped in 2 spots not even close to any seams.  I have been wearing Dickies for years and years and tried these and were total garbage.
B004ZWB1KM|5|It came in a timely manner.  No problems.  Just great, would buy again.  The holidays are hectic enough so when there are no problems getting gifts it is wonderful.
B00DZPAKQG|5|Need to go two sizes bigger
B004K9MOBA|4|comfortable on your pkg
B00O6BUI3S|5|good
B008M6V7PQ|5|This shirt fits amazing! I'm a very small girl 4'9 -130 pounds.<br /><br />For me ordering a small.... this fit perfectly!<br /><br />Any men out there, looking to order this shirt,<br /><br />My boyfriend who would normally wear a medium, I would probably order him a large... or x-large.<br /><br />other than that.... A++++
B002RWJ7A8|2|Fell apart after a month.
B000T35WR4|5|I haven't owned a bra that fit like this one, and was as comfortable, since I wore training bras!  Just love it!
B00E1EVKOQ|4|I had to go to a Brick & Mortar store to try on these Dockers, because the D1, D2 and D3 were Greek to me.  I found the D1 to be flat front and fit my small buns nicely, the D2 was a &#34;Regular&#34; fit and a little loose, and The D3 were for Plus-size people.
B00HNKQCYS|3|The suit is cute, but I could do without the girdle like tummy panel. The suit pinches in at the waist which makes it difficult to pull up over my hips. It is also lower cut than illustrated on me. Probably a great suit for someone with larger breasts and smaller hips.
B00Q1EG55S|5|I love this suit, very flattering. ordered a couple sizes up and fits perfectly
B0041OFBNC|4|It looks much darker in picture. Like Black, but the one I received if medium to light brown. Otherwise it is an awesome robe!
B0023NVBB4|4|We have a lot of babylegs in our house, with two small kids running around. The babylegs we own are considerably shorter than these mesh ones, and so had been relegated to the younger sibling's pile. The older child was heartened, then, to see that these ones are plenty long enough for her--a very tall almost three year old. We haven't put the sunproof qualities to the test, but they are definitely cute and she says she really really likes them, which is great. As always, babylegs come highly recommended from our household. My only complaint is that they still have a tendency to roll a lot on chubby legs, requiring pretty frequent adjustment once they get mobile.
B00BEFNTMG|2|Had adequate room for the foot, but too tight around ankle, and left squeeze mark around ankle.
B000MX3RLO|5|Love this bra. Fits great. Soft material.doesn't ride up. Looks great under clothes. Great fit.
B0092TNF0W|5|The quality is pretty good but there is a little smell
B005I33OVG|5|Only had them for part of the one winter, but they seem well-designed and durable so far.
B00AOCBJ9K|5|Absolutely love/ looks great with leggings and boots
B00FCC9NT0|2|Short but big
B004DB9R6A|4|Nice fit and comfortable, but the color was too yellow in the animal print for my taste. The person I bought them for was pleased with the lighter weight of the material and said they were perfect
B00G3IMIQ2|3|I bought these as a gift for my 6'7\\" man.  The length is perfect, but we were surprised to find the right hand side pocket sewn shut.  Overall, the pajamas are soft and comfortable, so we figured we could adjust this, but as others have mentioned, after paying over $20 for the item, one shouldn't have to make alterations.
B00B8ZEW8W|3|i liked it and i semi like the color but sometime when i used it it make my head aitch because of the wool material.
B00KOKE60Q|4|excelente
B00ET1V77G|5|Thank you.. nice product
B00JSMKYWK|5|I've received many compliments on these shorts. Some of my friends call these 'short shorts' but I say this is how men's shorts used to be up until the early 90's.  The twill material is great quality and the bright red is a nice alternative to 'safe' earthy colors.  These shorts can dress up easy with a tucked in shirt and belt or go casual with just a tee. The only minor downside is, if you have good leg development,  the opening can ride up a bit to the thickest part of your leg.
B005KSKPJI|5|Daughter loves them
B00MHQU5G4|5|parecia mas claro en la imagen que cuando lo vi, igual me encato
B00CI06ZGS|2|This dress is not the forest green it appears to be in the photo. It is a nasty green that looks quite faded and dull.<br />The lining is also quite short.
B00007G2HG|4|My niece will love them she love the sassy look of pink and she love the gurlieness of flower power.They look a little ichy though ,but fun and makes the little ones  accually whant to put socks on. She realy dosn't like toput on socks but she saw these ones and asked for them.The only thing is that i hope that they don't have those threads from the outside picture all over inside the socks like a lot of other picture socks because it makes it a bogger to get into and your toes get stuck and you end up ripping the threads and the pictures get messed  up.Well hope i've helped even though we havn't tried them yet!good luck
B00K8F3VXU|4|A1
B00PN08BB2|5|Fits perectly and are very comfortable!
B001D50GWS|5|Got these to snow blow during this past brutal winter weather in the NorthEast --- Warm
B001AE9EQ6|1|Have ordered these jeans for years, they are the only ones my husband wears. Now I'm sending them back.
B00F6SKP06|5|Just love how lightweight and cozy this pullover it. The little lacy parts are very girly and give it a nice touch!<br />I am a size 16 and it fits nicely in a Large... Really cute! Thank you!
B00HLXYCAS|1|Very cheap material. Made only for fake boobs it seems.
B00R9FTSL6|4|It is slightly small but it I love the colors. It is simple and pleasant.
B00N5TJ3JC|5|i like it
B00I4XBELY|3|It looks good, just that the color is orange, rather than red
B00BGD1WL6|5|Used this for a Halloween costume (I was Theodora from Oz the Great and Powerful). Looked perfect, and loved that it was shapeable as the character in the movie had it up on one side.  Would love to wear it again sometime!
B005DN0JQ4|5|This onesie was a Christmas gift for my niece.  She will be walking and crawling soon, so I thought it would be appropriate for her.
B00JKFT13S|5|Love
B0047EXQF6|5|I got these for my daughter's birthday and she loved them! They were perfect in style and comfort.  She had wanted some classical black silk pj's but the prices were very high. I read the reviews on these and ordered a size larger than she normally wears. She thought I forgot her size, then she put them on and said they fit great. She wants more, yes!
B00209X5SS|5|Have bought them 3 times before.That means they are Excellant..Had neck surgery..Great..Easy On and Off..Wash nice..Nice over Shoulders...
B001H0FCB4|5|I just love Isotoner gloves because they aren't bulky, and you don't feel restrained.  Breathable and Warm, stretchy material And they are stylish!
B00BXOBWN6|1|Worst you can even imagine.
B00A1G07YW|5|My son loves this! We used it as part of his Halloween costume and now it's a regular jacket.  Seems to be good quality. It's only be washed 2-3 times but it is holding up well.
B00BUISAZI|3|I could cover a 6' long table with the fabric. I don't see myself using it as a scarf, but it was cheep and will made a lovely sheer summer cover up. My new lovely pink sheet!
B009YKEU2Q|5|I was skeptical about even fitting in these since they say 32 inch waist recommended. I bought them anyway however because i plan on losing weight and getting back down to what i was last year (29 inch waist). When i got them i stretched them out with my hands and was like &#34;oh man! These are STRETCHY!&#34; . Put them on my chunky self and bam, they fit! Granted i am pretty curvy: 47 hip, 36 waist, and 48 bust. They do flatten out my butt and don't look as good as yoga pants and due to the thickness of the legging, they make my legs thicker HOWEVER, THEY FIT. Even kind of have a tummy control going on. I have no muffin top in them. They are SO WARM. . As for shiny... i wouldn't say they are TOO SHINNY. They do have a bit of a shimmer but i wouldn't say mine is noticeable. I love them. You should get them and try them out! There are always returns if they don't fit or not your liking :D. Well worth the money. I plan on wearing these almost daily! .<br /><br />(also this is my first review, but i couldn't NOT make this review as many reviews kept saying how ridiculously small they are. they fit like stockings.leggings. They are suppose to be tight!)
B00LPQ0DJG|5|Fits great but the top button on vest fell off the first time it was worn and it didn't come with a replacement button. Other than that I love the outfit!
B005UE6YGA|5|Good quality, true sizing, nice color (Dark Slate). Not too warm, will be nice in office. Wish there was wider choice of these kind of sweaters. Will buy again on discount. :)
B00FFZ3EO4|4|Great! but a little bit short.
B00NVPPQNW|3|Pro's:  VERY fluffy. Very soft.<br />Con's: Seriously I put these on and an hour later everything I touch has sock lint on it.  Also they are not quite long enough.  Kinda poor quality, I don't expect them to last long. One already had a hole when brand new.
B000BRMGJU|3|The neck cover part isn't quite long enough for me, I'm 6'3 so maybe i just have a long neck. Ill probably just end up cutting the neck part off, it just looks too goofy... and i usually don't care what i look like haha
B002AH996M|4|looked great partnered with my boyfriends Red lantern shirt going to be lanterns for halloween got several compliments on it already overall fit well alittle tight at first just needs to be broken in
B000BNZBAK|5|Love it I feel like Charlie Brown
B00H6V4ICW|4|Arrived on time and fits as expected.
B00EQ0LNEC|5|I bought these for my sister and she really likes them. The gloves and scarf are soft and warm, and the gloves work with her smartphone. Exactly what she wanted. One thing not shown on the picture is that one side of the scarf is a plush brown material. My sister really likes that, but maybe other people would not.
B00PKM4ID8|1|Too thin! Are not suitable for cold weather.
B004MNRVCQ|5|This was purchased as a gift.  I received it on time and was very pleased, my boyfriend absolutely loved it...thank you
B00M0UXH94|5|Very  happy with belt. well designed.
B00E3QUYBC|2|It was a trim cut size not what I wanted do not think it was listed correctly as such
B007RUV6EK|5|South Korea bought in. Shipping was good. The body of an 98% children from their peers.It fits very well.
B004NZVH5K|4|very good money clip, simple, attractive, strong magnet, does the job so far. Was a little thicker than I expected, otherwise happy with the purchase
B00KIBYBJ2|5|Just received the dress and weeks early too! It's beautiful and fits great!
B00B97RFEM|5|what is not to love about this shirt? seriously, it's a soft, high quality, stretchy material, the design is great, the printing is high quality. i love it. if you want it too fit loose, maybe go with a size up from normal for you.
B000LMO1IE|5|very silky 100% silk so it is what you get as expected. get it!  it is great for men and women.
B00MNTNGRA|1|This says one size fits all.  No where near it. Can get into any one size fit all but not these.
B00H20K3WQ|1|This child size  very disappointed.
B00FVSZSR6|5|These sweaters are cute and perfect if you are a owl fan..&#34;.i bought 3 already they arrive before the time they say it would
B00KCDLEC8|5|My daughter loves the coat!!!!
B00LHVJVFG|3|legs were not even.
B0058FQLVO|4|For the most part the dress fits great. I get complimented everywhere I wear it. It's not see through. I think it may be stretched too much (doesn't really fit) for those saying it is. I'm not a busty girl so the neckline is plunging. I just adjusted a bit but it fits great otherwise. I just wish there were slits up the sides to make it a bit easier to walk in. Another adjustment I may make.
B004BDOPSU|3|Feels cheap and rough.
B00J8LNK5Y|4|Block shade and it looks nice depending on the outfit
B00TOHDP2U|5|Fits perfectly and it came early :))<br />Top looks like neoprene and feels like it
B002R0GS1Q|5|Warm, even though it isn't that heavy. I love that I can wash and dry it and the material is tough. Only complaint is that the black shows marks pretty easily if you brush up against something. Glad it's washable! Lets see how long it stays black with all the washing I see in my future.
B003ZS3NN0|5|I bought a few of these to share at belly dance class. They were very affordable, they're pretty, and they're fairly audible. Overall, fun, stylish, and a great price.
B00KML6YES|5|Finally, a place for all of my &#34;loyalty&#34; cards, membership cards, and business cards. I have been using a rubberband to keep them all together, and consequently having to sort through all of them to find the one I need. Great little holder!
B00GEH6M5A|5|Fits as expected. Material is very soft and comfortable.
B008KAA9M6|3|Im not sure If i would like the shirt because it was way too small when I got it.
B00130RILA|5|This bra is a great fit. Soft, comfortable with just enough support,very please with this purchase of Hanes Pointelle wire-free bra.
B003UAZM50|5|Husband loved it!
B005549NW2|5|A gift
B003YHV1KY|4|Stays function as represented, visible wear and tear after only 2 months of use.  I would expect to replace after 6-8 months.
B00E6E3M10|5|Anything from UVSkinz is great quality for UV protection for children & adults!<br />A must for gifts!
B00FT75WUM|5|Excellent product doesn't leak color in wash, great fit, does not run &#34;big&#34; or &#34;small&#34; it's perfect just what I was looking for plenty of pockets to toss things in. Will be ordering more
B0016BU74G|5|this is a great top, very flattering and slimming, and it covers the extra 10 pounds i gained after i hit my 30's.  love this shirt, i wish they had other colors or patterns--i'd buy more.
B00VPCGY0M|1|You get what you pay for!
B00BY2XNO8|3|i love the feel and color... however the only disappointment is the size. even though i ordered a true size the crotch is cut very low so you better not expect to have this sit exactly on your waste without your junk being shoved to the side of the pants lol i like it but the only thing is i have to ware it way too low below the hip so if you have a big butt like me half of it will be hanging out lol like a plumber
B00KKUGD2O|4|The bras that are the correct size fit true! I have one bra that is a 34C not my size. Just make sure you check all the tags before wearing. :(
B002G9UEHC|5|Great hat! Warm and the brim keeps the snow out and the hat covers your ears!
B008PDBZHQ|5|This review is for Casual Moments Women's V-Neck Sleepshirt, in grey and XL size.<br /><br />I have multiple health conditions which makes my weight fluctuate, and XL is the largest size for this fabric (bamboo-- I love bamboo!). The fabric is very soft, stretchy, very comfortable. It's not as &#34;roomy&#34; as I'd like, but will probably be perfect when I lose the excess weight. Even if I don't lose the weight, this is still a very comfortable sleep shirt.<br /><br />I am 5' 2 3/4&#34; and about 200lbs right now (my weight & mass fluctuate constantly!), currently wearing 16/18/XXL; hourglass figure. The sleeves are a bit long on me, but not problematic as they are very slightly tapered (if they were flared it'd be a problem)-- I think it's because I'm short, not the garment. I have broad shoulders and large diameter upper arms-- this fits comfortably; not too loose, definitely not too tight. It has &#34;give,&#34; making it quite comfortable. It's about knee-length on me (again, I'm short), so it's nice during hot weather.<br /><br />The night shirt, because of it's fabric & drape, doesn't leave much to the imagination on a big gal like me; it reveals my lumps, rolls, and cellulite. Not a problem for me, because I care about comfort and this is for me. But, if you're wanted to look pretty. . . .<br /><br />I'd buy this again, because this has been quite a comfortable wear. There are some loose thread ends, but that's not a problem. Seems fairly well made. I'm happy with my purchase & choice. I do hope the company will expand their sizes (to include XXL) and color choices.<br /><br />EDIT: 20 July 2016<br />The sleep shirt still fit even after my weight jumped to 240 lbs (thanks to medication, which was lifesaving, but horrid side effects). I definitely don't feel &#34;sexy&#34; in this, but it is comfortable to wear. I've spent the past year pretty much living in pajamas, and this (along with the pink one) has been the primary &#34;night gown&#34; pajamas. It's very easy for limited mobility and the extreme fatigue of multiple chronic health conditions. The sleep shirt did stretch out, but isn't &#34;out of shape.&#34; It has laundered well, and I still wear them (I have 2 of the grey and one of the dark pink) regularly (at least once a week, if not more often). These are especially great for the &#34;in between&#34; time of I need out of these dirty pajamas, but I'm not ready to get showered & dressed yet. Those who have chronic illnesses will understand exactly what I mean!multiple chronic health conditions.

B00HAU9CA2|5|I saw this scarf on amazon with a new seller and thought I would take a chance as my wife loves scarfs.  The scarf is very nice, well made and my wife looks stunning it.  She has worn it a few times to work and when we have gone out and gotten nothing but compliments and people wondering where she got.  I would highly recommend this scarf to anyone looking for a new look or whom loves scarfs as my wife does.  As for the seller they provided great communication and very fast shipping an A+ experience all the way around.
B000QWDQTE|4|I love how this product holds it all together and is undetectable under clothing. It doesnt roll up but it does bunch up at the waist if its too tight. I gave it a four because i got confused with the sizing. My natural waistline is 24 but my dress size is 4. So i got the the xsmall. I am able to wear it but its so tight it hurts and i am forced to take it off before 8 hours. Maybe i should have purchased the small instead. Then again my goal is to get smaller so im hoping it would fit more comfortably soon
B00H8AIMZ0|2|The wallet is beautiful and feels sturdy.  I have the brush metal black and it feels really nice.  I would've given it 5 stars, but I wish there was a way to protect the outside from scuffs.  It have it for a little over a week and it's starting to show signs of when it brushed against other items in my pocket.  I usually carry 3 things (phone, keys, and wallet) in my pockets, so wallet and keys get to share one.  Pros -not flimsy metal -color looks nice -accordion design makes it easy to use cards -lock snaps in place and stays locked  Cons -only 6 pockets for cards, more than six and it won't close -scuffs easily   ***UPDATE*** A few months later the wallet is coming apart.  Two of the card dividers have come undone.  The brush metal case is completely scarred with scratches.  This wallet does not stand the test of time.
B00D3ZSVC8|5|good made, warm, looks like as a picture. for a warm winter.good for sport. recomend for all, little big, but we are growing.
B00P61J3E2|3|I bought this as an Arizona winter coat, thinking it would be a bit thicker. It is not what I expected.
B005QEOSX0|4|The ID holder is perfect if you only have to use it once.  If you need to remove it and show the id at a bar or restaurant it is a very tight fit.
B001AIV6WC|5|Bali is my favorite brand of both underwear and shaper panties and this pair fit the bill. Probably one of my favorites because they control without cutting me at the waistline. A sure winner!
B005C9GJDG|5|As always, a great product!
B00P0DPWV4|5|Due to the fact I have been waist training for about a year now. This particular one is much more comfortable than any other ones I have used in the past. I am 5&#34;3, about 169 lbs., and started off in a size 38. Im now in a size 34, waist training can be very effective if dedication is given. You will see better results if you excercise. Of course you can't just wear, without exercise, and it and expect it to slim you automatically. I've purchased, in the last year, about 9 to 10 waist trainers, and have spent a pretty penny on them. By far this is the best. Way more comfortable, and gives the same support as the more expensive ones I purchased.
B00C3U2GVQ|3|It was smaller than the other size 14 I ordered and so it didn't fit her very well at all
B00K8LWBKI|5|Good for gift
B009GX8FO0|5|I'm a size 12 in pants and a size 14 or 16 in tops, mostly because a wear a 38DD bra. The size large fits perfect. This nightgown is so soft and a very pretty color. Not too short. I'm 5'6&#34; and the hem comes just above my knees.
B00N9X6NLU|4|It is the type of coat I like that fits snugly around my neck and has the ribbing around the wrist.  As long as don't wear anything bulky it should fit fine
B00DHC9TPK|5|First let me say that I am 5'11 size 18. I ordered an XL. Fits perfect just wish it was a tad bit longer but my seamstress should be able to take care of that.  The dress arrived within 2 days and I absolutely love this draws
B0013IVF48|4|This spanx model is my fav because it's heavy duty and eliminates that lil muffin top almost everyone gets in those tight low-rise skinny jeans. And because its a thong, it doesn't squash your rear view assets and give you a blocky look like your Nana in the 1950's :)<br /><br />ONE FATAL FLAW (sigh) ... it just will NOT stay up. I even got the smaller size.  If you have a car trip to the club or the party (or any sitting down) once you stand up you'll be fiddling with trying to pull the top back up all night - or worse, enduring a triple roll down squeeze that will begin to seriously squeeze. Ouch.<br /><br />I'm going to make a 4 points fastener myself to attach it to my bra strap.  I want more of these for the holidays in more colors! I does fantastic things if you can make it stay up.
B00O5P233I|4|I'm giving these four start because they smell like strong oil. Will see if laundering them and the use of fabric softener will get rid of the smell before thinking about buying more.  I tried them on over a sock and with a combat boot looks great. love the color.  If you look at the small print it will tell you which ones are tight.  I'm short and have short legs and big calves and the fit on me is perfect although next winter I intend to wear them scrunched down, that is if the smell comes out in the wash.
B009PIEPTA|1|I'm currently a 5'9&#34; size 170 pounds, size 12. Imagine my surprise to discover that Hanes thinks a &#34;plus sized&#34; woman requires hosiery with legs that are 6 inches longer than mine.  I didn't even bother trying them on.  Really disappointed.  Not sure who these fit.
B00EYID83U|5|It is the most realistic dress blue uniform I have found for my son. Unfortunately it is made in china only complaint
B00J9A9QYS|5|Fits and feels great.  Wonderful support.
B00J6OVETW|2|This bra isn't what you think it would be. No instructions on how to use it . Not comfortable at all when you finally get it on. Not worth the money.
B00SX64II8|5|Fits good and super cute
B004TERIVW|3|it's a rather flimsy bed jacket and it runs small...
B00D8SN350|4|I did order it a little to big but I still loved it  will buy again will recommend to all my friends
B002SP2U3U|4|Great costume for my 18 month old.
B00SWJH3OW|5|I LOVE these jeans. They're soft, comfortable,  stylish and flattering. They are true to size. I'm going to buy all jeans from them!
B00CIBJFVE|5|The lettering is really good quality doesnt crack or anything. The shirt is great I love it.
B00E7OKOFG|5|It looks very nice on. And slimmer looking. You can dress it up or down. I love the material. I even like the the necklace, that comes with it.
B00E48ZZ22|3|The pic of the girl looks great on the advertisement... The top and bottom price got perfect and the fabric isn't itchy... I still can't figure out the zig zag cross straps in the front and became impatient and just threw it in a drawer. My life is extremely busy and I wouldn't expect to take so much time putting in lingerie... The order came quickly which was exciting, but I haven't wore it because I can't figure out the straps. It should have come with instructions.
B00O5AHQ3U|5|Bought one for each of my grand daughters. Very romantic and will be lovely for family portrait!
B00KSZ2IEI|1|Awful
B00J5ANSZU|4|I ordered a Large. Im 5'4 about 150lbs. It is somewhat short but im not use to wearing dresses, i usually go for long dresses. But i like..comfy.
B00TKNL1SI|4|Love it, I am a size 16 and the XXL fit great!
B00KIJTQJY|5|Awesome very happy
B000FE9890|4|It is hard to find a soft crew. They all run small to my taste. I am not embarrassed by my body, but also not trying to look like a body builder. Getting the next size up works great. If your looking for the soft modal feel this is a great crew.
B004DNVOXM|2|Don't buy these trunks!  I bought them for a vacation, and swam in the ocean for 3 days.  Hung them up to dry after every use.  By the 4th day they were pilling and developed a small hole.  Had to throw away after the trip.<br /><br />Not a quality swim trunk (but they did look really nice)
B007Y8ZDZ8|5|These are my favorite jeans : ) So comfy, so flattering and such a great fit. I have three pairs and would certainly recommend them to others!
B00NIVOA5O|5|As pretty as it looked and sturdy too
B009MS2B3K|3|the card slots are a little bit tighter than I would like but serves the purpose after forcing them in
B0091KAFPA|5|The top of the dress was a bit big, but that was me buying a size up just to be safe. I ordered a 3x and definitely could have gotten away with a 2x and still looked great. Other than the it came exactly as described, and I received a ton of compliments on it at the renaissance faire i wore it to. I would definitely purchase from this seller again!
B005KOJ1UG|5|They are not huge but they are large and comfy and stay up on my calves.  I needed size 13 - 14 and these are correct.  Other Gold Toe's I've had in the past have held up well.  I expect these will also.
B008KRZV5Y|5|My son loves this jacket! Very warm and high quality material. It holds up well with washing too! It's also thick and comfortable.
B00K829TA2|1|this looked so cute, but what I received was cheaply made. You could pick the little silver studs right off!
B00JCUPW3E|5|Very nice and quick delivery!!
B008KTIO56|5|I am happy with this necklace.I got it in several colors,shipped from china really quickly.Would purchase again great style and versable
B00N4QCH62|5|Dresses up a plain top & keeps my neck & shoulders warm - so I don't need a coat or vest. Was exactly what I was looking for & at a GREAT price. Delivered quickly and as described.
B00N4C65ZA|3|Quality just ok
B005SN0CSO|4|This &#34;G&#34; String is very comfortable and looks good.  My partner thinks there &#34;flattering&#34;. LOL.........<br />Colurs are really good. I like bright colours!<br />The only thing I could improve on is the sizing information. I found that the sizing was more towards larger than smaller.  That is I am usually an &#34;M&#34; but i shoukd have purchased &#34;S&#34;.<br />If you want everyday &#34;G&#34;s then gi fir them. Yiu might akso get a nice surprise from your loved one!
B008JRVBJU|5|GOOD
B00DN1PJKY|5|I am 5'3, 110 lbs and wear a size 24 in jeans. So finding over the knee / thigh high's that fit me right is very difficult. These fit perfect! They are soft, thick enough that you don't have to be super careful not to rip them, airy, and I don't have a huge problem with having to pull them back up constantly. They conform to my legs very nicely without having places that are too loose but they are not smothering tight either. I've put them through the washer and dryer a few times and there is absolutely no damage. I wear them two ways, either up over my knee as descripted, or i pull them down below my knee and wear as slouchy socks. I would most definitely buy more if they had more colors or if anything happens to the pair I have I would gladly purchase again.
B009Z79CB2|5|Well made, warm and super true to size.
B00SBCQXDC|2|It sucks
B00AWD5ETW|5|Love It! Great Holiday gift for Family Member,can't wait until they open it on Christmas Day, I think they will love 2!
B00NTVNZO0|5|Comfortable, not itchy sits nice on head, looks good!
B00MSRYPRW|5|It IS large.. although that was expected. Its a well-made, very cozy, &#34;wearable blanket&#34; My daughter loves it!
B00KFASI2W|5|Its very comfortable material just too small. Will reorder bigger size. Super fast shipping and excellent customer service.
B00394DM7C|5|I love this. It's comfortable. Easy feeling, cotton feel is very nice. Makes the chest perky. Nice, and delivery took forever!
B00A9VWSDM|5|It was a little expensive but your paying for quality. Its adjustable so thats a plus.I have small wrists and it fits comfortably cuz its made with soft material, as i hoped but honestly i expected it to be cheap and hard thankfully it wasnt.
B0020BVU60|5|Used for a costume and worked fine.
B00OC0VYCC|5|Love this!
B00B1GEXV4|2|It comes very small and the material does not stretch at all I was very disappointed and too much of a hazel to return.
B00CFEKTVE|5|The best ever. At first I thought it was very thing the material, but it does work great. It does not roll up and it is seamless.
B000UALT3W|5|Real nice jacket for the money. Had to buy one size bigger for best fit. Fast delivery.
B00MFCLHTO|5|A great T shirt, the fabric is kind of hard but still comfortable. Love the pattern and color, looks fresh in summer.
B000JHHEG2|5|I always have trouble finding pants of any kind to fit perfect. These jeans are perfect even after washing. I am amazed how well they washed. Size selection is wonderful, so I will be buying these for a long time.
B00WR2SN3U|5|Very comfortable!
B0011W885A|5|I love these arch supports. They are exactly what I was looking for!! I received them in just a few days from the time I ordered them. Will definitely order from this company in the future.
B007Q9MCJK|5|Awesome fit. Soft. Comfortable. Flattering.
B00422M6G8|5|Very good quality and great internal finishes. It also fits Brazilian Real money. I would reccomend this product if you like small and slim wallets.
B000GL1EGW|5|I was reluctant at first to order this.. not sure how the husband would like wearing stripes.  But it actually looks nice on my tall lean guy!
B00AWSO0D8|5|These are the cutest gift I could have purchased for my grandson.  He enjoys them so much, I am sure we will have to barter to get them washed.
B00LTLKZ54|5|I like it
B000TA529K|5|So far so good, had them a couple of months and they wear well
B00DD5FP4K|5|Gift item- it was greatly appreciated.
B0083YJZAQ|5|They fit true to description.  The denim is soft.  It a solid pair of classic jeans.  Button fly, straight leg, mid rise.  So glad to have found these.
B002QM1EIM|2|It says these \\"one size fits all\\" tights should fit someone weighing 90-160lbs, I weigh about 130 (give or take a few pounds) and am about 5 feet. My thighs buldge out the top of these tights(not cute). I do have thick thighs so might work if you have skinny thighs (like the girl in the picture). Also if you are short they will be way too long. They are cute and cheap but its too bad they only come in one size.
B006LPHJ7U|5|less than $10 for something that holds almost a dozen cards (DL, credit cards, etc).  I would definitely buy again.
B00J9XK34W|4|I'm a Boomer & don't want to look matronly, this is just right with a casual pant or dress.  I'd buy more colors.
B00LX6YU9C|2|Even as a newborn, this dress never fit my baby. Cute dress, just not a good fit.
B00HFGLCYA|5|Great mittens, easy to put on and off and keeps my daughters hands warm.
B0068FN760|5|Love this jacket, esp for price and Prime shipping.  Weather started to warm up; but still needed hoods for rainy Washington.  Found this<br />online, nice light weight and water proof, had it in two days, long before I had time to shop locally! Daughter loved the pink!
B00D8DTI68|5|Great product, delivered on time and great quality.
B00JVDVDTO|5|My daughter loved it..shipping was fast
B00OQTBM3A|5|It's great.  Just what he wanted
B00H4UHRDM|5|If you have a &#34;straight-ish&#34; figure like me, this dress is for you! makes me look curvy!  Striking design about knee length on a 5' 6&#34; frame. Have worn it twice already and love it!!
B00174EKUE|5|Great socks. get great comments all the time.
B007563HS4|4|nice jacket, but the body is a bit shot compared to the nice long sleeves
B00P39KC74|1|Horrible quality. Lace snags and rips at barely touch. Do not waste your money. Threw it in the trash after first time worn .😕
B001D6KMCG|5|So very sexy! Fast delivery! Very satisfied with the item, there was a small tear in one of the gloves but nothing I couldn't fix myself. Watch out, Halloween! Here I come!!!
B00GKCU7C8|5|Simply a lovely dress. Fits perfect, not too big and not too small. Drapes just right and flatters the figure.  Material is very nice and dress is made with quality.
B00NI76HJ0|1|Made of a cheep almost halloween costume material.  SO disappointed!!!
B007CRR7Z0|5|Excelente
B003E1X220|1|Picture makes it look like the are over the head, but they are clearly behind it.  Also, the band was so tight I could barely fit it behind or over my head.
B000AMQK6G|4|Difficult to find item. The quality and price were were acceptable.
B00ABJXARA|5|Awesome shirt.  Moisture wicking, lightweight, and plenty of length.  Highly recommended.
B00JSQF7ZU|5|Love it, Super cute!
B00N3JYE48|1|I love palazzo pants & I wear them all the time so I will wear these often.<br />I searched high and low for a pair of funky pants for a Halloween costume and decided on this pattern. They arrived on time and were just as pictured.<br />I am tall  (5'10&#34;) & I wear anywhere from a size 14-16 to sometimes an 18 so I ordered a large because the XL was not available. The fit and length are good but I will have to wear a colored panty shaper because the material is thin and somewhat see- through.
B002JZXMWW|3|I got this hat for my husband and he found it to be a little too small but lucky with the material it is it can be stretched out a little as its worn in so if it is a little small at first it might need to be worked in a little. The color is very nice, some straw hats have an unappealing yellow tint to it but this hat has a nice tan. However it is very thin (some people in hotter areas might like) and the straw was sticking up at areas a little flake-like. It does have a very nice shape and style though. I think for the price I would expect it to be made with a little more quality. I definitely would not order another hat for the price ($48.00) but if it was at a lower I might order if we needed it replaced.
B002QB0VEQ|5|This shirt fits well.  I am of a medium build and I feel that it is comfortable without looking too boxy.<br /><br />Also, I love the fact that I can just toss this shirt in the washer & dryer instead of making a trip to the dry cleaners each week.  I have not had to iron these at all, and I can wear these in a professional setting without worry.<br /><br />These shirts look great, feel good, and are an excellent value.
B005NWCH0Q|2|The picture is very attractive which I couldn't say about the sweater itself. The metal part is cheap looking and the colors are not so impressive. The sizing is even worse. I wear medium size but the medium of this sweater is good for my mom who normally wears L. I wouldn't pay that much money for this sweater if I saw it at a department store.
B008G29EVA|5|These socks are quite interesting, I had never worn a sling back.  Very comfortable, I'm very pleased, so I will buy again. This is about my third pair love them.
B00LL3DWA0|1|This ended up impossible to enjoy wearing cuz the fabric n decoration on the bottom are so light and it could get ruined easily and isn't pretty to wear like it looks in the picture.
B005Z5UJ1A|1|Fits well. Then after wearing it (obviously washing it) my boobs became itchy. Not the nipple. Just around my breast a. I stopped wearing it for a while. Felt better. Then I wore it again... And the itchiness got worse! So that's when I figured out it must be the material!<br /><br />I did some digging around , and apparently there are some bras out there made out of formaldehyde!!!<br /><br />I think this may be one of them. I'm going to stop wearing them and see how my boobs are.<br /><br />Just be careful because we are nursing our babies. What bras we use are super important.
B00HCEPCX2|5|I think I bought it slightly large, but I wear a tee shirt underneath.<br />It is very figure flattering and long enough to wear over leggings.
B00FV1HU60|2|Weight and size of coat was great; however the metal zipper did not pull smoothly.  Additionally, the zippers on each side of the top of the coat are decorative only . . . there's no actual pocket.  The holes for side pockets, where I often put my hands to keep them warm, are small and I would envision them eventually tearing at the seam. I returned the coat.
B005LAM0G6|5|this was an excellent shirt i love it. it wasnt itchey and it fit nice. it also came pretty fast
B002B55YRG|5|Love these. The look and feel is awsome. Try em you'll love em.
B001R4C9FW|5|These are great socks- kids don't feel the seem inside the sock, so he helped my children with socks &#34;not feeling right&#34;.
B00487L2Y4|3|I expected more support, and the fabric ripped in the front panty area<br />Good if you are only looking for light support
B002R0FH2C|5|Fit was perfect.  Like the adjustable straps.
B00D6BAD4S|5|My son loves this shirt. He thinks it is the funniest thing. I gave it the 5 stars for him.
B009MOX7ZA|5|Another great color.  Just what I wanted.
B005RRA41G|5|Good fit, good quality
B0010KIOES|5|After having problems last winter with STABLEicers (stretch-on) falling off my hiking boots, and discovering my hiking boots weren't very water-proof in wet mushy snow, I researched alternatives and found these overshoes.  I was disconcerted to not find a 'womens' style, but when I checked out the NEOS website found out that these were acutally unisex and they do not make 'mens' or womens' - which  makes sense for an overshoe!  Campmor had a unisex sizing chart, and I bought size S - for women's shoe size 7 - 8 1/2 (my normal shoe size is 8).  Unfortunatly, the size S does not fit over my hiking boots!  So if you plan to use with hiking boots I would definately order a size up.  I debated exchanging these for size M, but discovered that they fit perfectly over my running shoes, and decided to keep them.      I've used them several times so far - and it's only December 10th  - once for a trail run on hilly, icy terrain (over my running shoes- how great is that?) and several other times over my 'house clogs' to walk down my icy driveway to take the dog for a walk or get the mail.  They now 'live' outside our back door and my 2 teenage sons have been slipping into them in socks this past week for quick jaunts outside.    They are extremely warm which is important to me because my toes get cold very quickly.
B003675QVW|4|Perfect color gloves for jessica rabbit at a decent price. Be aware the color is a little less deep of a purple, it is more true to jessicas gloves in the movie. They also are not as shimmery as shown in the picture. The cigarette holder works great, is an aweaome addition to the costume.
B00KRP1BRO|2|This dress was way too small and should not be considered plus size. I've order other dresses that fit prefect. The material was thin and cheap as if you were to wash it, it will rip apart. I would recommend to smaller women but to my plus size women, PASS!!!
B00JNUA1AM|4|I love this pant, so soft and comfy , perfect.
B000JHHGOW|5|They feel very well made and they fit well.  Loose but not baggy.  Have worn thermals underneath and they don't feel tight.  I pick up the black in 36x32.  I am now looking to pick up another pair in the brown.  Highly recommend.
B00N0S9RYO|1|Too small - scaled for the asian body.  Had a hassel returning it, so donated it to Goodwill.  Learned my lesson - no more asian imports.
B002P8VOY6|3|I ordered the size (medium) I usually order for just about everything, but this Trench Coat was cut way too narrow in the shoulders and hips for a medium.  The sleeves were a perfect length and the cuff was adjustable.  I loved the color and the general appearance of the coat, which is why I am exchanging the medium for a large.  Just hope the larger size won't be too big!
B00OC35GXC|5|Love it!
B009ROG28E|4|I bought these as a gift for someone in great shape. Usually a medium in Armani underwear fit him perfectly, but he did need a large in this particular style.  Other than that, the photos don't do them justice.  They're really spectacular!
B004OVCZ9K|4|I would call it black, but it fits well and will serve it's intended purpose. It appears to be of good quality material and workmanship. It is NOT machine washable as stated in the product details, but Dry Clean Only. Also it is not made in Vietnam, but in Cambodia, not that it matters. It arrived in good condition, wrinkle free. All in all, I'm happy with it. Five stars if the details were correct.
B001NDGD90|5|Nice shirts.
B007X94JPS|5|This is Mrs. Bremner my husband absolutly loves batman and this gift made his week. He wears his shirt as often as he can. once every few weeks. The shirt fits wonderfully. thank u so very much again. hope to do more business again soon.<br />Sincerly,<br />DeAnna Bremner
B00IDHF1RY|4|Great for getting my little girls hair out of her eyes.
B00K3DM6SS|1|This fabric is so thin, you would have to wear three of them unless you're a nudist....
B00CD9HFFO|4|size runs bigger than most
B00EKTOK1C|4|feel like a princess
B0077I3LDG|4|Fit's true to size, would buy again, pockets would be a plus. Champion never disappoints me. Will buy more in different colors.
B00E3EC9VM|5|I purchased this tank as a tunic to go with leggings and a cardigan for work. I loved it so much I bought two more, and I probably will splurge (what a funny word, considering the price!) and get all the colours. The ruching is great; I can adjust where it lands on my body and can go from a tunic to a very blousey shirt. The<br />material is a little 'see-through' so to keep it professional I wear a camisole underneath. All around, a great find.
B002HJ2SFW|5|Fit as expected. So far no issues. (Savane Men's Big & Tall Wrinkle Free Flat Front Twill Pant,Black,48W...<br />Savane )
B001C4RSWG|5|I bought this to go with a Flapper dress I wore to a Murder Mystery dinner. The boa was exactly what I wanted. The price was less than I expect and the boa actually arrived two days before it was due. I'll definitely be using Rhode Island Novelty for all of my costume needs and recommend them to everyone! 5*****
B00GD7LSLY|1|Took way to long to come in and the fit was all wrong and weird. It says they are mens pants and I am a girl and the fit was definitely like womens pants...however I got a size as if they were really mens pants and the fit was all wrong.
B0018QHNDM|5|I liked the scarf it is what I wanted it was perfect for my outfit it was what I expected
B000N8Q01C|5|Shipped fast ,fitted right always
B00KGXB7AI|5|Received my order fast. It was so pretty! True to sizes if you are petite or Asian. It fits me well. Love love love love!
B0007CKNTE|4|Great Pant.
B00L36KJH4|4|I am a medium size or 8 but I bought the small size following the reviews.  Still, the sleeves were very long, the shoulders and torso somewhat wide for a small size.  I wanted to change it for Xsmall but was not available.  The poppy red color and the material is very nice though, and the length in fine too.  I will try a petite small, maybe this one works.
B0018SCFLU|5|I have a smallish waist, heavy thighs and no belly. I am also 5'2\\" tall and take a 6-8 in skirts, but 10-12 in slax. These jeans hit me perfectly at the waist so that I can wear a belt or not. No gapping-no ridding down.  I have to wiggle into them to get them over my thighs, but once they are up they are sooooo comfy!
B00589XWRG|5|I bought this to wear for a grinch christmas party outfit. The kids loved it. Since it won't be used that much I didn't want to spend very much. This does the job.
B00GPJJ4ZW|4|Quality is good. Coat is great. I am a slim large and when I ordered it wasn't even close. Had to go through a lengthy (over one week) exchange process to order an xl.
B003V2MIJ0|1|I bought this headdress and was immediately unhappy with it.  First of all, it looks nothing like the picture.  The one i received barely has any blue in it, the feathers are sprawled apart so you can barely walk through doors.  Bascially, it looks nothing like the picture shown.    Shame on you, Costume Store, for trying to fool the American people with this brutally ugly headdress, by trying to pass it off as something ligit.  I would refund it but they would only refund 80% of the purchase price, and after I pay to ship it back, I would only end up getting about half of what I paid for it back. So, lesson learned, but for you folks out there....STAY AWAY!!!
B00EZS12BO|3|The skirt is very cute but after one wash it starts to fall apart (loose threads). It also has a oil odor to it so you have to wash it. If you take care of your clothes it should last a little while, you get what you pay for. Overall I like it and its a good buy for the price.
B002HMWR7S|5|I actually ordered this by accident but I'm glad I did. Perfect color for bruising and a great addition to my spfx kit.
B002CP4WK0|4|My son wanted to be his favorite character for his high school halloween day. He is usually a men's small but I went with a Medium for this costume and am glad I did. It fit just right. The blow-up stomach is kid of hard to get started, and the one strap broke as we were putting it on, but it was a nice touch. The costume is good quality. Just wish the mustache was re-usable as the &#34;sticky&#34; wears off and he had to scotch tape i for his 2nd use that week. But all in all a great costume for Mario fans!
B000GQDUIW|4|Overlook the imperfections and have fun with it.  For the price, it was worth it.  My boyfriend loved it!
B00INL6WDC|5|Love it, however prime failed because it came a day later than it said and so my husband couldn't wear it to the event I bought it for.
B008EHWLYY|1|I strongly dislike this product.  Please do not buy it.  Made in china animal fur is nine times out of ten dog and cat, these are so sad.  I would like to know why some people buy these, is it just that people don't realize what animal the fur is from or do some not care, or some other reason.  I think the main reason is people just don't know, they aren't bad or anything, its just lack of knowledge.  If you do care, please buy items that are not labeled animal fur or faux fur which is usually dog fur, or better yet, demand answers that are truthful about where it comes from and or what it really is.  I really do not like supporting cruelty.  Thanks for reading.
B002HF0A10|5|I got me a pink floyd shirt.  I love it.  I decided to get my brother one as well.  He loves his, too.
B007IJ5QCI|1|I didn't like the jean
B003E3YWKY|2|I ordered XXX-large, and the shirts I received were more like X-large.  The shirts were fine; it was just that the sizing was completely wrong.
B00HSH9C5W|5|The socks are adorable...exactly what i wanted except too small for my daughters feet. I thought i was buying girls (9 yr old) with a size 4 shoe. But these were too tight and small.
B0080ML8Z6|5|These t-shirts are soft, comfortable and good fitting.<br />Make sure you search around for a good price, as I've seen them from $3 to $7 each shirt! Get the 100% cotton, not the less expensive blend.
B00DN1DAN2|5|Very nice!!
B0026HXXSQ|3|This comes a bit large. I would order one size smaller than what you are used to.
B003EEMBG0|5|Great
B010LEWY1W|5|NIce fit, and Nice color
B009FIO94Q|5|These scrubs fit well and have a great style to them. I typically wear a size 6 pants and ordered the small and they for wonderfully
B000AYIQNO|4|Good bag, I only wish it was bigger but it is certainly a sturdy bag....  I recomend it.
B003S9Y600|5|good
B00E68YNFA|5|These are exactly what I needed!  They fit perfectly and give me a little room for my expanding belly!
B00C1WZASW|5|Wife loves it, I hate Daryl.
B00DS5AK9K|5|These pants don't cling, but are loose and flow nicely over my hips and thighs. I love the fit, and of course they're extremely comfortable.
B00362TPAA|4|Great for the price, i bought these for an arts and crafts function at the childrens hospital. I brought tempera paints, feathers, gems, etc...for the kids to decorate. They had a great time and the masks served their purpose.
B002IF61W6|3|The price was good & received product in good time. The shirt was decent quality but lederhosen was pretty poorly constructed. It ripped the 2nd time trying on.
B00IL4L3C6|5|This is my favorite nightgown that I ever purchased! The quality of the cotton is excellent, the size does run on roomy side - but wouldn't want it any smaller, I like a roomy nightgown! I am 5'4&#34;, 115 lbs and it would still fit loose and comfortably if I weighed 10 lbs more!  Very pretty embroidery and washes beautifully!
B00EBXUUNY|5|She gets complements and they always ask where did she get it at.  They want one! Good quality material  too!
B00JO6ZEGG|4|This swimsuit is amazingly cute. As the other reviewers noted, use the size chart because you have to buy a much larger size to get an adequate fit. I'm usually a medium and bought an X-L and it fits perfectly.
B00KAPVHHK|5|Really nice
B002RWJ7YO|3|The stretch is good and they are thin enough. The only problem is, one of the clasps doesn't hold well and has to be adjusted off and on during the day.
B00D48ZJ88|5|The fabric is really soft and the dress is very flattering.  I'm 5/3 and a 10/12 so I'm pretty curvy.  I ordered the large.  It ran just a tiny bit large, but I'm sure after I wash it, it will be perfect.  I will definitely order again.  I got the red and gay stripe and it is a little see-thru so just plan for that.  Otherwise....perfect.
B00KBDSMNS|5|These were perfect for my recent trip to Mexico!!!
B00PI1RBSK|5|Great item and great price.
B00IOQBUIS|1|Straps to keep lunch box on broke of so it can not be hooked on backpack and backpack tore on sides. I had to purchase another lunch box and bookbag already!
B00EWC0I2W|4|Jockey wear is the best. Lasts. Doesn't creep. Comfortable
B00394SWKE|5|Bought this for my 6 month old - fits true to size.  I still have her wearing this even though she is almost 8months - but it is getting a little short.  She is in the 25 percentile for height.
B006UJFOHE|5|this was purchased as a gift for my Doctor Who addicted daughter.  It was the perfect size and the material was comfortable.
B0096GO29E|4|Like the feel, build and look.<br /><br />Dislike the front identification holder (loose fit with solo id, must put other cards behind to keep tight in wallet)<br /><br />Bottle opener a great added use, but loosens the grip on $ if not careful and needs some convincing to get back into shape.<br /><br />Overall a nice wallet for the price.
B00IZMWJPO|3|a little short in the fit
B00BYOEDX6|5|PERFECT! Exactly as described! My girlfriend and I are huge fans and she Loved it! Would definitely recommend to any Sons of Anarchy fans!
B000VQBABQ|5|I totally recomend this item to any creative zen v owner \\"It's Great\\" and affordable. This has been my greatest buy so far!!!
B004UE32UC|5|Comfortable pants , not weight , is a positive color deep point like the kind seems to have faded point
B006MHZZFK|5|The quality was as advertised [a surprise] and the fit was comfortable.  No wet stretching and head aches... Just put it on and wear it.  Of course I had it monogrammed.
B005NYO5MW|4|Nothing digs in.  Gives good shape, great for thin shirts / t-shirts.  Would rather it didn't have the pattern on it, but it is faint.
B003OQUJ2G|5|This will make my work a little bit easier to do home impovments need all the help you can give them
B00DXF6LLQ|5|Absolutely adorable. My granddaughter looked so cute in these stockings.Very good fit. I love the shoe part of the stocking.
B002XULOY6|4|I was somewhat surprised by my order both with sizing and the fabric. I bought an xs for my 74 pound 56 inch child and they barely fit. The fabric was a very heavy weight spandex-nylon. They are nice looking for dance/ fitness however have a sheen to them that would look odd for everyday use.
B002GHC2XS|2|I've had this jacket for like a year, and doesn't fit as expected. Not sure if this can handle machine washing either. Have tried this in bigger sizes, but feels the same. Jacket binds around my back, hood's too small and the weight of the whole jacket is carried by my neck, and now the sleeves are too short.
B00CFQIQUI|4|Nice tie dye color, but arm holes too small for me.  Had to return it.  Easily done.<br /><br />Bought another from same vendor that fits great.
B00BKXCY8M|5|This is a good set of clothing for the Los Angeles springtime as the fabric is airy.<br /><br />Splendid cloths for babies is always amazing on the feel and quality of the fabrics. They are perfect for the hot springs and summers here around LA.<br /><br />I have never been disappointed with Splendid clothing.
B00W6V80P8|5|This dress is very pretty.  I plan to move the rose over a few inches as it is only tacked on and i find the placement a little ackward.  I am pleased with the quality of the dress and am pleased it didn't cost more.
B00OMAYNDE|5|Great light weight workout jacket.
B001CKJ8BE|4|Mostly bought it for, um, \\"roleplaying\\" can't say much else than it served it's purpose. If you want something that's actually reenactment quality you should look elsewhere.
B0079AI3PS|5|I actually bought this for myself as  a treat.  I really like the comic book look.  Very nice quality material.
B009J7AHQM|4|Really confortable and cheap. I liked the material and its the same in the page. Im deffinitly buying againg in the future.
B007TBJAH2|5|These swim trunks are great!!!! They run a tad on the big side though so I would recommend ordering a size smaller than normal.
B000TA74IM|2|Too small! Hard to get on or off. Its a big disappointment. I wouldn't recommend  them to anyone, sorry I ordered them.
B00DGBO5KG|2|the wig is for fun but the hair is very sparse,  I won't be able to use it unless i figure out how to close the gaps between the hair and the scalp... It's just for fun so I'll figure something out.. for the price I should have expected what I got.<br />Shipping and packing was excellent..
B00GMPILQC|5|I usually always have cold feet, especially when sitting in my office. Since I wear these socks, cold feet are history! Great feel, great fit, nice look, soft and very warm! I hope you get this item back, I will buy more.
B00LVO7LOM|4|The tank feels quite comfortable right out of the package and it's really quite cute in my opinion. Ultimately, I ended up returnin it though because I was looking for something that pull be comfortable to sleep in. This had a built in shelf bra and molded cups, neither of which would work for my purpose. Honestly, if I had more money that I could invest in something like this, I would have kept it for daily wear.
B001GBHAGO|5|Got this to go under my dress for a wedding - exactly what I needed!  So much more comfortable than traditional panty hose!
B002VZDQ80|5|I remember I got one at Hot Topic when I was seventeen and when I was eighteen , after new years 2011, it went missing. My mom must of sold it to good will by mistake. My older sister ordered for me on the 28 and when I got it, the shirt looked great. I got a large. I'm a medium. The shipping was fast. No winkles, no stain
B00KDO6TR6|5|Great Bra for the price! Will buy again.
B00IB1M3PK|5|LOVE these sweat pants, super comfortable. I will agree with the previous reviewers that the crotch is sewn a little high, but not in any way uncomfortable. I will absolutely buy these again.
B00JXFXY3S|5|Very pretty light weight
B00JQZQP40|5|good
B0080C1ZL8|5|This was  a Christmas gift.  It wasn't going to be able to wear it for a couple of months, so I really don't know any more than that!
B00EF55X58|5|For some reason these cases are difficult to find locally; except in an optical store where they are grossly overpriced. Just what I needed at a fair price!
B00NU4Y9NW|5|I love the socks. Nice soft quality material and comfortable fit. Great fit inside my tennis shoes.
B00084Y4AA|4|These sweats are great for winter.  I wish they came in a petite size. They last forever!
B00JVTNZ1M|5|Love these socks! Very comfortable and fit great.
B00LI6715C|3|Too long
B00I8P9YTW|5|LOVE the dress, high quality, well made. I have a VERY large bust (Fcup) so it doesn't fit quite like the skinny Minnie in the picture, none the less it fits and looks gorgeous!
B000WJJIVQ|4|I got these for my 5 year old son's dance costume. They fit perfectly and held up through quite a bit of abuse. He'll be able to use them for many years, too.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the white was not a bright white, it was dingy, looked like there was a bit of gray in them.
B00T3SMSNW|5|Hat  mir gefall,fantastich  Dress.wow.
B00FVZGYWM|4|I bought this for St. Patrick's Day as it was tough to find something green for him.  There weren't many size choices, so I bought the 12 month for my very large 6 month old.  It's long in the sleeves and legs of course.  But I'm glad he will get to wear it in the upcoming fall.
B00KA2XL36|5|Good looking.
B004XONKMO|4|I lime it
B00M1TJD2O|5|Fits perfect even with an undershirt. Won best ugly Christmas shirt contest!
B006RD9EMO|5|Loved it, perfect for what it's worth. Definitely Durable!
B00B99OJ1W|5|Did not expect much for the price ,but for quality of the material and the fit I am more than satisfied and my little one loves it .
B008Q0E8FE|4|They look like light weight gauze fabric but they are made of a stretchy material.  A few were longer than others and they are about 10 inches wide.  I like the colors.  Arrived quickly.  Wish they had more colors!  I would buy them.
B005TG0O8I|3|Fitting but material is really not good. Shouldnt complain much for the price paid though.<br /><br />Its a fun top though.
B00DO73YCC|1|The Large Size , More Like Child Size
B00BOFWLKW|1|You know those glitter cards you don't like to handle because glitter ends ups everywhere? That's this shirt times 10. I had glitter covering my bathroom floor, my hair, my face, arms....it was literally everywhere. I will never where it because of this. Last thing I want is my nose to sparkle while I'm out. It's a shame because otherwise, it's a really pretty top.
B00NLMZ2HA|4|Compact and efficient. I am concerned that pulling credit cards in and out will wear on them.
B00NAGTQBU|3|The material is rayon so do not ever put it in the washer because it will make the sides longer and the front and back shorter.. even with washing on delicate cycle and with cold water. This skirt has to be washed by hand.. I probably won't be buying another maxi skirt that is made of mostly rayon.
B00FTL0U0U|5|It's chilly at work, but I need to type and do other things. Fingerless gloves were just a it too covering and these now do the trick. Very cute and stylish. I've bought numerous of these in many colors. These were the most expensive, however they are the warmest and cutest with the beading.
B002C010KA|5|I've spent a great deal of money on bras trying to find one whose straps did not slide off my narrow shoulders.  If only I had known about this product sooner.  It absolutely works!
B002UADKEQ|5|The front is a mesh see-through material. I couldn't tell that from the picture but I still like this little outfit and my boyfriend really likes this outfit.  Fast shipping also.
B001YOQ0YG|2|uneven sewing job!!!!!!
B00CJDHFDG|5|Love it!  I look like a curvy diva!
B00CX7PVQ6|4|Good!
B00LNKTT12|5|great for the price
B00HFE5KZ4|5|WEIGHT WAS 185 AND THE SIZING CHART SAYS XL BUT IT WAS TOO SMALL. RETURNED IT QUICKLY AND ORDERED THE XXL AND IT FIT JUST RIGHT ON THE 1ST ROW OF METAL CLIPS AND IN A FEW WEEKS, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FASTEN TO THE SECOND ROW. REMEMBER THE HARDER THAT YOU WORKOUT AND SWEAT, THE QUICKER YOU WILL SEE RESULTS WHILE USING THIS. I WEAR MINE FOR EXERCISE PURPOSES ONLY AND NOT FOR CORSET TRAINING. IT DOESNT PINCH OR IRRITATE MY SKIN. I THINK THIS IS SAFER THAN CORSET TRAINING AS IVE SEEN GIRL'S RIBCAGES AND INTERNAL ORGANS MESSED WITH WHEN USING CORSETS. JUST MY 2 CENTS. RECOMMENDED TO ALL MY FRIENDS. GOOD LUCK LADIES.
B001QISRIM|5|Good quality at a decent price. Good color combination being white and black and i I would buy it again.
B008VARBOO|4|Perfect in worm seasons.
B00B6S3RG4|5|I have read a lot on the Internet from the competition and people who don't even own this or the Gino Valentino suits from Darya Trading. These suits are real they are not fakes, who knows or cares if Luciano Natazzi is a real person. I know Donald Trump did not design my DT ties. These are great suits, they come from a warehouse not a store so the costs are much lower. No showroom no salespeople, typical clothing mark up is at least 100 per cent. That said I feel these suits are easily worth twice what I paid.
B002K9RXAE|5|This sweater is pretty lightweight, but just warm enough, and I like the 3/4 sleeves.  I've received lots of compliments on it and I think I may even be able to wear it after pregnancy because it seems to stretch to your shape somewhat.  The color is stated as black, but there are medium gray yarns woven into the sweater, making it more of a charcoal color, which I like.  Overall a great buy!
B009IO52P2|5|I've used these bras for a number of years.  In fact, they are getting hard to find.  It is a wireless, t-shirt bra and very comfortable.  I wear it even for yoga practice.  I gave up on sports bras because they are too difficult to remove.
B00AJEDGG2|4|I liked the product, and it is super cute, BUT, i would say that i am busty and this was a little smaller of a size then what i would consider for a &#34;one size fits all&#34; garment. But works great non the less. Colors are true to pictures!
B001UI5FFG|5|I am usually skeptical about plain ballcaps, as they tend to appear cheaply made, but this one fits good.Not too low on top and an easytab velcro strap to adjust, along with airholes on top.Overall a great value
B00UM33CQE|4|Fits great, lightweight.  Haven't had it cleaned or laundered yet, so not sure how it will hold up.  But so far, very pleased and may purchase a<br />second one after I clean the first one purchased.  Many compliments on it item!
B007YJ8H82|5|Love these socks!! They are everything I thought they would be and more.
B00HXMXA64|5|For any who dont already know Bonnie Jean dresses always run a size larger. Also I would say if you want to get the most out of this dress it does need to be hung up to dry, but super worth it. It was way cuter in person.
B00GAPAGCG|2|the color is very different as the photo its more like militar Green, do not like the color very much!
B000VZRPFM|2|PROS:<br />-The packaging was very elaborate, with 8 hidden pins to find and remove before the shirt can actually be removed from the cardboard.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-This shirt is very shiny. I'm not sure if that is a fashionable thing in the office world but it looks terrible to me.<br /><br />-This shirt also fits like a tent. I got it after some reviews said it was narrower in the waist than most. What the hell is going on here? I'm pretty typical weight, yet every shirt that is snug in the chest feels several sizes too large at the waist. I understand office drones tend to look a bit more prosperous in the midsection than people in other careers, but if you're going to sell a product that fits like bell bottoms for your torso, put it in the description, please.
B00H486AJG|1|Fell apart the second day I used it
B001M2DSOA|4|These are a pretty pale pink color, they are long, stretchy sweater type material, very warm and cute
B00NW33TUA|4|My boyfriend loved it!
B00631VPT0|5|excellent
B003R9FRRC|3|I just needed really inexpensive thigh-high tights and the price was right. They're not high quality or anything that will last.
B00L9C404K|5|Super cute! I'm 5'1 & 106lbs & they fit perfectly! Not to short & not to long. Comfortable & I love working out in them! I will prefer more
B004LXNDCO|5|I have worn these gowns for years.  This is the same high quality as always.  The gowns arrived before expected time.  First time I have ever ordered gowns and am very happy.
B00KDCBM7A|3|It's like wearing a tube not much waist definition
B0044JH3P8|1|Like another review I just read, I just had the same problem.  The shirt that I got was not even close to this shirt I ordered when I received it.  I received an all black shirt with a poorly done cartoon spiderman with speech bubbles.  I had ordered this shirt to wear for a specific function at the school I teach at.  It was too late to exchange it so I had to go without.  Hopefully I can get a full refund for this waste of time.
B00K5VYCOO|5|My son love,it
B00O9XF1E4|5|I got the 6x because my daughter is very tall for her age and I wanted it long enough. Well, it's long enough for sure. It fits like a 7, but in a good way. It will fit for a long time, which will be good because she grows so fast. I don't find that it being a little bigger is a bad thing, it still looks good on her. I would just say that if your child wears a 6, a 6 would fit just fine.
B005ZUL3H4|4|My like it, little tight around the collar
B008FMS3FO|5|When I got this I was so excited to see what it looked like and it was cuter than I imagined!!! Can't wait to be able to put my lil guy in it!! :)
B00FGJ8WYQ|5|My daughter wore this in my wedding. She looked beautiful. The quality was remarkable. It clearly exceeded my expectations especially since the price was so great.
B003VZE2RI|5|These are super comfortable, not very supportive but comfortable.  I highly reccommend..these are great for bumming around the house or for sleeping
B002B9SU3W|5|I live in Southern California and it's very hard to find rain slickers here.  However, I wanted to get one for my son, because we have been having an unusual amount of rain already this winter.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a rain slicker, because again it's normally not that rainy here and I'm not sure how much my son will actually be able to use it.  It worked out perfectly for us.  The item was just as described and was just the right price.
B00GZMLTSE|5|I absolutely love this dress! It's so soft and comfortable...and very lovely! I have worn it twice and have gotten several compliments! I would definitely recommend it to anyone! ;)
B00DIV6BKQ|1|This is NOT &#34;100% Polyester&#34; as is described. It is 100% cotton. The trademark tag on it is also highly suspect; the stitching on the tag is questionable, along with the trademark tag itself. Just saying, don't claim something to be an official 'DF Cosmics' shirt if it's not. Overall though, the shirt looks cool. However, I'm returning it due to the inaccurately listing that this was a 100% polyester shirt.
B00422M6FE|5|Product purchased for a gift and texture and color is best seen in the good gentleman accurate color and good finish
B009E3243A|5|Fits well if a bit tight in the face if you so choose to zip it up all the way. Not hard to breathe if you do either. Looks great, has sound stitching, and soft inner fabric. I, being a big fett fan, love it.
B00CONNILE|3|I was disappointed, but that was my fault. I ordered based on the size chart, but I should have known to get a bigger size.
B0046BMMNW|5|This robe is plush and soft.  However, please note THEY RUN BIG!!  Please consider this when ordering.  I definitely recommend this product.
B008MATTI4|1|I ordered a medium and I doubt it could even fit any small sized adult. The waist is maybe 25&#34; around and can maybe stretch another 3&#34;. Even if I could stuff myself into it, I can't get it past my shoulders and I'm not particularly wide either.
B006TVV14I|1|I bought as a gift for my 3yo neice.  It arrived in weird plastic wrap, wrinkled and not folded correctly.  It does not feel absorbent and it's not as cute as the picture.  I sent it back.  Even after misting it with water and throwing in the dryer it was still wrinkled.<br />I would not recommend this at all.
B008AUYPKI|5|Fantastic leggings -- for any occasion - from casual to a little dressy w/boots.
B00CMENO1O|1|only can be used with swimsuit!!! naked naked no coverage ...not happy at all ..i go to the beach once and awhile so that will be the only time used
B00DYPUFTE|5|Fit my daughter who is a girls 10 / 12 great.
B00JQONZRQ|3|Rough cotton material. ... not comfortable.
B009LEFVNW|5|Love love love love love love love this shirt! its perfect for all of my bridesmaid, it is low for some skinny girls but they can where a black or gray undershirt its fine, but I just adore this shirt that I'll probably get one for myself cause I love it so much!!
B0002ZI7N0|5|I like my new dickies clothes  they fit me like I was expecting and the colors are awesome i will buy some more
B00F14LJF0|5|fits perfectly<br />although the gloves are kind of small
B0053VK33A|5|Arrived on time, well packaged. Nothing else to say. Nothing else to say . Nothing else to say. Nothing else to say.
B000JFF600|3|You get what you pay for. The socks were ok at the local mountains, couldn't complain, but I wouldn't take them to Aspen or bigger resorts. They stick to the leg pretty tight except for the toes, quite loose in there. Overall I like them with my snowboard boots and not so cold SoCal mountains.
B00JF2UWRU|3|Fits like a Small!!
B00F4MXJQG|3|I read on a review of this dress in a different color that it runs really small. I'd usually wear a size 2 which was unavailable so I took a chance on a 6. It actually fit pretty well. It was a little big throughout but a 4 may have been too tight. So I'd suggest going 1 or 2 sizes up in this. It's a darker gray than the picture, very dark. It's really cute though. The waist and skirt are perfect. The lace really accentuates the small of the waist. Unfortunately the cap-ish sleeves just didn't work for me. They extended wider than my shoulders and made my arms look super bulky. I'm petite so if your shoulders are wider this might work. I'm sad that it didn't work because it's really cute.
B00U2I2DIM|5|Recieved my shirt weeks and weeks earlier than the date so that was perfect for the shirt I am normally a small in shirts and I got a small but it is majorly huge but u got to remember it's a unisex shirt so it also fits a men's large such as I am a girl
B00EYU9MW4|4|Ok/Like it
B003S9VUP4|5|I've been wearing blue jeans for the most of my adult life. It was time for a change. Columbia's Ultimate Roc pants was the clear answer. Comfortable, good looking and durable. They are my new 'jeans'.
B001DLGWKM|1|It is not even close to what I thought it was going to be. It is not a compression shirt more like a undershirt  poor quality
B0085X3KFQ|4|I love this top. I would love it more if I were shaped like the manican used in the picture. I'm realistic when buying clothes, but how could I not want this top! It is beautiful in person too, just not on me.  I'm not a big fan of tight or clingly in my mid-section and getting a bigger size may help that part, but then the staps tend to slip off the shoulders.  Wish I could have the same design, different fabric... it's still VERY pretty.
B005ZMMB82|4|So, I was pretty anxious to recieve this item. I could picture it now; Me walking around looking cool in my new khaki doubju jacket. Beautiful sexy women smiling and looking back at me because of the overflowing coolness factor protruding from my every being ever since i put the jacket on. Yup, the khaki.... actually i really dont know where I am going with this, but all I really wanted to say was that the jacket is cool, hip, and different. The stitching is pretty good. Im a medium so I got an XL. It fits nice, not too loose not to tight. I will be ordering the Black one today. Speaking of colors, BEWARE: the khaki color is more like a commando green. Thats where the deceiving part plays in this. Thats all.<br /><br />gEt IT!!
B005FOLV90|5|This was a gift for our grandma.  It is very soft and nice.  She really loves it.  It is a nice color white.
B00EIKV2D2|4|This was a gift. The end user is happy with the product.
B000LXO6ZG|4|Product was satisfactory, delivery prompt.
B00A3TF03K|4|this fits a little tighter than the women twin, not as comfortable but oK
B00417Q9YO|5|I love these jeans. The only thing is they have bled some blue color into my beige bedspread from sitting on the bed in them for days before they had finished fading. My fault entirely.
B00ATFC9UK|5|Our grandson loves it!
B00KQ7XAN6|5|Bought them for my granddaughters. They fit perfectly. Well-made.
B00117G9ME|5|These are the nicest, softest underwear. I love these! I wish I bought more pairs. I was afraid they would be to granny like bit they were not granny panties at all. Very sleek. Im happy.
B00GH0TOOK|5|Great top. Fits perfectly.
B003ZW1AEU|4|The leggings are comfortable.  I ordered according to the sizing on the product information page but they are a bit big.
B00EOQHU6S|3|but luckily my sister is a Md and it fit her fine. i ordered an XL and it fit like a kids XL 14-16
B006NKC1QC|4|Fits as expected.  Decent cotton, front panel does not match as Hawaiian shitrs should.  Pretty comfortable and has not faded.
B0066SJZHY|3|I was so excited about this hat because I had been looking for something just like it for the longest time but it was too small for me so I gave it to someone else.
B002MQ6L4O|4|I like the jacket... I got a small. Converting to say a suit size it is about a 38R, i usually wear a 37S and of course still need some tailoring to bring in the sides. I would definitely say if you are 5'8\\"-5'11.5\\" u got the right size. And of course not be completely skinny and lanky otherwise you'll be swimming in it. It is very comfy jacket and well made and well worth the price as long as you can fit the right size. I've learned to never try to buy the wrong size just because its on sale, its a nice jacket, wear it as such.
B00EIQLRW2|1|Weird clingy fabric
B00960BLI0|3|Beautiful jeans, but just not sized right.  I'm a true 29, which these were, but didn't fit.  They were too tight.  I also think you should know that Bootzee Jeans are a higher rise.  Not quite at the waist, but not really mid rise.
B00VWDUBDU|5|I love my new swimsuit! It fits me very well and the bottoms are perfect,,It didnt take long to ship ,it was really worth the price.👍
B000M9JJ9M|3|What I thought this will be and what I received are two different things.However, ordering items such as this without seeing it and wearing it will have this consequences.
B004M3XBL6|5|I was so happy to finally use this product it has given me a chance to wear some clothes that I was not comfortable using because of my age.  I recommend this product , it allows you to reinvent items you hold dear but just were not to comfortable wearing because they were low cut.  I purchased the pack with all of the colors and styles and love it.  I know you will to.  FANTASTIC ADDITION TO YOUR CLOSET
B00OSHTGSS|5|My Grand-daughter loves these PJ's and wants to wear them every night!
B00ASGIJ0Y|4|I think these ran a bit big. My lo is 19 pounds and they were baggy on her, but overall a nice product.
B00AWJ6QBG|4|I really like this when I walk or work in my yard.  The only real lssue is the arm holes are too wide and the zipper doesnt have any material between it and skin and the zipper scratches and pokes.  Kinda irritating so I have to tuck it under.  Got the small and should have gotten the xs.  Just a little big rides up some.
B004G8UYLM|4|It's just as awesome as I expected! For some reason when you first get it, it smells kinda weird, like tar or something. At first, I didn't know it was the hat, but once I separated it from my luggage, it became obvious where that weird tar smell was coming from.   Other than that I mean it's okay!  I still probably would have preferred a model you pull over your head rather than the velcro, but with the velcro at least you can adjust the tightness-- sorta. :D
B003YJHBCO|5|They fit nicely and are snug in the correct places. I wish they came in larger packs, but my feet require special attention and they socks are perfect.
B007646U02|2|Like many others, my husband was impressed with the look and style but sorely disappointed in the quality.  He had only worn it a few times and it started looking very worn where buckled.  We expected much higher quality from Tommy Hilfiger and will definitely think twice before buying that brand name again.
B005OBDNX6|5|Good choice!
B00FKU8XV8|3|theyre alright.<br />there were three tan marks on one of the cat's ear.<br />material is nice and thick<br />the threading on the inside doesnt 100% match the cats on the outside. it was alright.
B00ACP1VR4|5|great quality hoodie. Can't wait till it starts getting cooler here in Florida so I can start wearing mine
B00O9G9SH2|5|I absolutely love this dress! I was concerned it may be a bit see-through, as it appears to be in the picture, but it's not at all. I'm 5'9&#34; and it comes down to just above my feet. There's also a slit that comes up to about 6&#34; above my knee. At 125&#34; this dress fit really well, but it's definitely not form-fitting. This is one of those dresses that's billowy in a flattering way, so it's a safe bet for times when I plan on eating impressive amounts of food (which means I'll inevitably end up with a sizable &#34;food baby&#34;).
B00G99MMY8|5|I initially ordered this hat on Zulily and loved it.  I fit perfectly.  It kept it's shape and came down just over my ears like I wanted.  I was able to find other MAGID Newsboy hats on Amazon for very reasonable prices and ordered about 7 to 10 hats.  Was also able to order hats to dress-up outfits or to wear with jeans.  From tweed lurex, to corduroy to rhinestones.  LOVE LOVE LOVE these hats.
B00EB0YZ2E|5|I have a hard time finding jeans that fit me right and Wallflowers certainly does. I love them and they are priced great!
B002OEBE82|3|I ordered Iplay, Solid Rubber Rain boots, black, size 7. I am an adult female.  When I received them, I had received a TODDLER size 7, if there is such a thing. While they were of good quality, and the style I wanted, they were CHILDREN'S boots. I had to send them back.It didn't say ANYWHERE on the website that these were children's boots.  I ordered 2 pair, in the same size. One was for someone else. The invoiced prices were completely different. Not real impressed with the different prices for the same item, or the sizing. But, for a child, the boots looked very sturdy.
B00K2VCO9M|4|I WAS SURPRISED  HOW VERY PRETTY THIS BLOUSE IS.  I WASN'T AWARE THAT IT HAD AN ELASTICIZED BOTTOM. I THINK I BOUGHT IT BIG ENOUGH SO IT WON'T MATTER
B00J9R5ZPU|4|This jaw served the purpose for which it was bought, to see if it was long enough to hold all my hair off my neck before choosing one at FranceLuxe.com.  My hair is thin and only moderately long, so this jaw at approx two and three-quarter inches long was adequate but only barely.  The teeth feel warm to the touch, so are probably plastic also.  Since the finish wasn't smooth I would recommend this for only casual use.
B0002X0RC6|5|Lightweight, comfortable, very washable, no wrinkling. Can wear at home, the gym, or to lunch, just vary with different tops. Inexpensive but with a lot of quality. I have ordered them three different times!
B0081402J6|5|It's a high quality shir that looks pretty awesome on my dad, the material is great and doesn't feel cheap. I washed it a couple times by hand and still looks at awesome as the first day I got it... which by the way was on time.
B001MSVRAG|5|These pants are just what I was looking for: a navy trouser, with a nice medium weight and a relaxed fit.
B00PTD7XR6|3|A little shorter than I expected, but overall a good fit and nice fabric
B007TMVHM2|5|love it ...
B00JL8H8YI|1|Fit was much smaller than the fleece Columbia hat I had been use to. No way its a large/extra large. Fleece itself was not as thick as previous hat either. Disappointing for Columbia
B009Z3X20S|1|Title says it's a &#34;Men's&#34; hoodie but I received a youth medium. Way too small.  Returned for refund.
B00EJKQ7GI|1|Very disappointed with the quality of this. The spider form is barely sewn on.  It looks like it needs to be completely redone. The material is cheap at best and a large fits more like a medium.
B00JOOUDQO|5|THIS IS A GREAT TOP.  IT FIT JUST FINE AND IS COMFORTABLE.  I HAVE A FEW OF THESE TOPS AND I REALLY LOVE THEM.  PLAN TO VISIT THE SELLERS STORE.  THANK YOU.  BEA
B00ADSE3SY|1|I was so excited when I opened the package. I took the watch out of the case and watch didn't work.
B002RCY7FI|4|was a gift not as nice as I had hoped.
B009DK42E8|3|not good quality
B00D1R82Z4|5|It makes me look skinny so it does it's job. It comes with a black g string as well.
B00CVQOKUM|4|quality product but smaller for us size.
B004AS8QX6|1|Actual flip flops r hedious! I ended up buying another cheap pair in wal mart and swapped out the plastic part. The ones this pair comes w are twisted and the \\"scrunggie\\" that covers it looks horrible. The \\"rings\\" look like key Chains.. And the blue bows on my pair were stained. The pair I created looked decent.
B006L3V60I|4|These fit great, and more importantly, they stay on! I have not had any problems with them slipping, even after several washes. They do dig into my feet quite a lot after having them on for several hours, though, which is unfortunate. I'm a size 6, and the small/medium size left a really powerful dent all the way around my feet after 6 hours at the office. They don't cut into my skin at all, thankfully, but they do hurt if you've had them on for a while.
B004A66OCI|5|My mom loved it
B00CAA1UKC|4|Costume was very nice; however, after checking size chart either it defaulted to XL or we for got to adjust size.
B007CMNV82|4|Good product. Just know that this is super bright neon. It's a blinding bright pink. It's labelled correctly, I just expected less bright.
B00AJHRSCC|5|I am 51 years old and have always liked a traditional light jacket.  When I shop in stores this jacket simply does not exist.  You either have to buy a hoody and look like a teenager; or buy a space jacket that looks like you came from Mars.I was so pleased to see this jacket available online.  It was a great jacket and great value.  I will probably purchase another just in case this product goes away.
B00117XRM4|2|Color is not really natural, it is light yellow. Other than that it is ok, but the whole reason for buying this product is the color...
B0031U0PR4|2|I returned this because first the buckle is huge, second the belt is much to wide for any of my pants or jeans, and third I have a 42 waist and I couldn't come close to wearing this. I don't blame anyone, but if there was more information in the description, I would never have ordered it
B006C9HKJ2|5|I love this shirt because it is a great picture of Godzilla, it fit like it was supposed to and it was a great price compared to the other Godzilla items I looked at on other websites.  I highly recommend this shirt to any Godzilla fan!
B0041LQXQO|5|I ordered this product on a Monday and it was here early Friday morning. It was my boyfriends birthday present and he absolutely loves it! The material is thick and warm and he has a huge head so one size really does fit all! Very happy with this product.
B00126I5EO|5|Russell Athletic's  has been around forever and is know for their quality. This is not a standard tee shirt, This shirt is top quality and worth every penny. It is made  of a cotton and synthetic blend designed to keep you cool, and it does! Even though I bought a dark color, I felt cool even in the sun and it feels comfortable and the quality is there. Great neck line, sturdy and it keeps it's shape, By far my new Favorite Tee Shirt ! And did I mention...\\"I look good in it!\\" I hope this was helpful!
B007T9Y3RQ|1|I think they must have been mislabled at the factory because when I got them I also got a different pattern Frankie and Johnny pajamas a size smaller.  Those other ones fit beautifully.  But these were at least 3 sizes too small.  I returned them.  But will order another Frankie and Johnny set with a different pattern.
B00DY3LW98|5|Like
B00T6HEBH6|5|Very cute!!
B00JVMD8LG|2|Looked like a purse
B002OSWOMS|5|These are the only pajama pants my husband will wear.  They are roomy in the legs, comfortable, warm and long-lasting.  He has 2 pairs from years ago that are finally starting to wear after nightly wear and alot of washing.  Would recommend above any other brand.
B004OYEDQK|3|Missing the chain
B004HHO8VE|5|This is a perfect dress for Easter or a wedding. This dress serves for any major event that can occur. I love the fabric, the style and the scraf that also goes with this outfit.
B00EAATQTW|5|wife really loves this clothes
B008LY4TEA|3|the fabric is a little rough, I expect they will soften with repeated washings. unfortunately the pants came with unraveling stitching on leg seam-improper tension used when sewing. I hope the replacement pair will be ok.otherwise the style is cute, lots of pocket space.
B00H5GR42E|5|I find more and more that you get what you pay for.  I used to by the cheap socks in bulk but found that they'd slip off, shrink in the wash or just wear thin.  These socks are a nice quality and wash well. Our house is cold so I wear socks all winter long even with slippers.  These are fun and comfortable.
B00A3X8MTU|4|The quality of the t-shirt is debatable since I prefer a softer touch, but the material is strong. It's relatively thin, but a bit hard to the touch. It's manageable.<br /><br />The Nightwing chest emblem is a lighter blue than pictured, and also has a bit of a textured look to it.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend the T-shirt; after all, you can't really nitpick too much with a price like that.
B00QL1SK4U|5|i wear a different color on all my hikes as a bandana to keep my head out of my face or a sweat rag.. colors are amazing, one to match everything i wear!!!
B003N9BT7S|5|I was skeptical about purchasing this bra via internet - but I bought it and loved it so much, I bought a second one. I don't feel like I'm wearing anything, it's so comfortable.  And it fits so well, I swear I look thinner in it - no bulging over on sides or in the back.  It's so well made -  I just love it.  This is gonna be it forever now.
B002WB2V1G|5|It's very soft and cozy. Many people said it runs large so I bought the XS. My wife is 5'3&#34; and it goes down to just above her ankles (which she likes).
B005QXUOVG|5|I wear these daily and don't regret it at all. Perfect sizing and quality.  Colors match description and overall I'll probably buy more when needed.
B003IIJ4EY|1|Yes, you'll need x-ray vision to find a hair-like Superman wig anywhere in this world if it's not Halloween month.  All department stores and most costume stores don't stock Superman wigs and, when they do, they are usually kiddie size.  But no, this is not a good option.  The wig is HUGE and won't fit; the sideburns barely overlap the required area; it's vinyl so it doesn't bend easily.  And it sits on your head like a big, dead possum.  If you can, temporarily dye your hair black.  Or switch to Spiderman -- no wig needed there.
B00AEE7DIO|5|Absolutely the best sloughssock around bar none.she's happy I'm happy perfect socks.thanks amazon.
B009WS5S6C|4|It's a beautiful scarf and I wanted to give it give stars but it smelled so bad when I got it so I had to knock off a star. I mean it was unbearable....especially since a scarf sits right by your face! Otherwise it's looks exactly like the picture. It's nice and full like I like it. I thought the dark color in the scarf was black but it's actually a really dark chocolate brown.
B00K5PB1Q2|1|Product is not as described in title. This 505 style is not the same as the regular 505 style.  Fits like a male bell bottom pants.
B007H0WGNU|5|We bought this and 4 other outfits for out new great grandaughter Emma Rose and she will look wonderful in this and the others when she gets a little bigger and grows into the size I purchased. I intentionally purchased a larger size so that she would have some things to grow into and the mom tells me that she will be wearing them very soon, sooner than I had thought.
B009J7AGPO|5|i never want to wear a normal bra again, and since i got this bra--i haven't!<br /><br />i recieved this bra two weeks ago and since then have been living blessedly underwire free. i am 5'4, 120 lbs, and have 32 to 34 D's, and this bra is a miracle. i can imagine it working for someone much smaller OR larger than me, but it does not bunch or slide around. i've worn it with so much and it easily adjusts for different necklines and really keeps the girls in place! the lines don't show and it's more or less invisible unless in a cami (then the straps show). it's also long/modest enough to wear under a semi see-through shirt and not feel exposed.i wear this almost every day and occassionally to sleep (and i can't STAND sleeping in anything but panties).<br /><br />for the price--this thing is amazing, i'm ordering two more stat. i wish i could give it more stars--order now, you really won't regret it
B00TQ6TO6K|5|These just came today and I love them!  The are exactly as described.  It said they were relaxed fit so I ordered a medium and they are still nice and comfy.  I can wear these around the house or out to the beach.
B009PAWMH0|5|Fit's true to size. Crisp & clean look for hot summer days at work.  Even works for petites like me. Will wear often
B000BNYCT6|1|I did not like this particular shirt. initially, i was excited because i'd been looking for a good black tee. however, the design on front that i could not wear it comfortably. i gave it away to Goodwill.
B0058UECVK|2|I was very much looking forward to getting this onesie for my infant who scratches himself, but was very disappointed when I saw it doesn't have the capped sleeves as depicted. Otherwise the color and fabric were nice, but I returned it.
B00BRUTXGO|4|The photos are a bit decieving. The sleeves are actually very small. Less than 3 fingers wide on the medium. The dress however is beautiful and flowy. The slip underneath was very sheer and ripped in the first wash. It wouldn't be a bad buy if it was on sale or had free shipping to make it worth the price.
B00NG8LH50|5|So cute in my daughter, although the material is different from the one on the pic.
B00DJRCIJC|3|I was pretty disappointed after getting this outfit. The Fit itself is fine, but the mesh on the Right bra cup isn't the same as the left cup, making the entire bra look lopsided. The garter belt was a bit big, but its better than it being too small.
B00EVVR7VE|5|Exactly what I was looking for, and fits like a glove.  It has nice tailored lines and the color is gorgeous!  I am definitely in the market for more from torrid.  I'm very pleased!
B00GGPZHZG|5|PERFECTT !
B007WNRHFO|4|the material was a little thinner than expected.
B004FPYHDC|5|Wasn't sure of sizing so I only ordered one pair.. When I got them I was very pleased to fine they were true to size.  I  feel very comfortable ordering more.
B0035DRSOA|1|Do not buy these pants if you are under 7ft tall or have a dog. I am 5'10&#34; and these pants were 5 in too long. They are also impossible to keep clean looking when wearing because they attract dust, lint, and dog hair more than any other garment I have ever owned. They are comfortable, but have a baggy, sloppy look and feel. These are not worth owning. Do not buy.
B00AUG24QW|5|very good fabric huh pictures I like
B00LK2G2G8|5|Very comfortable and good looking.
B009FHN69G|5|I purchased this for my granddaughter and she looks so adorable in it!  The material was cuddly soft and the colors a lovely pink. Would buy another one.
B00JH1AVUW|4|Nice belt
B001V7Z9KW|5|I love these tights! They are easy to put on and comfortable. They look great and are holding up to my wear. I usually get snags on my tights quite easily and these have stayed snag-free after a few weeks of wearing them.
B00JTF6ZQK|5|I love this dress! It definitely shows your curves and looks so sexy on! I can't wait to wear it to an evening formal event.
B005PT6LB8|2|It was too wide.
B00J9PK2BE|5|Love these comfortable leggings. They fit perfectly and are cool.
B00ACIFP64|5|super fresh cotton flannel made ​​in very thin
B00JUJIOPA|4|Beautiful
B00NC0CLMA|4|fine
B00B7QEOS0|2|The colors were somewhat more muted than in the illustration. My biggest problem is that this was not a quality shirt. For the price I expected better. It is a very light weight 60/40 cotton poly blend. The printing is not high quality and the color of the shirt shows through. I think this is why the colors look muted. I can't comment on fit, because this shirt was purchased as a gift. The idea was clever, but the final product not so much. It wasn't so bad however that I feel like sending it back. It could be so much better.
B00FMV0NIQ|4|This fits me quite well, snug but not tight; soft material and good sewing construction.  Love the black tuxedo stripe on the side (elongating) and the length is quite good.  It can be dressy with heels and casual w/ flats.  Very versatile and easy to wash.
B007CRR7ZA|5|Cute
B006LTFV26|3|This shirt looks blue on the website but it is definitely black.  I ordered two different Dr. Who shirts....one blue, one black.  They are both black.  It's a good thing my 15 year old doesn't mind!
B004SW9N9K|4|I ordered these for my 15 y/o daughter. When she tried them on they were TOO CUTE! A little long...okay a lot long, but too cute.
B00RE3VYR4|4|General
B0002TOSUM|1|I bought six pairs of black socks and six pairs of brown socks of this brand. Of the six pairs of brown socks, three are badly sewn at the tip and threads and elastic filaments are being shed  up and elastic filaments. Of the six pairs of black socks, one has this problem too. It is merely a matter of time that holes will appear or the sock elasticity is lost.<br /><br />If I lived in the USA, I would have immediately returned the product. Herein Mexico I can not afford to do that since DHL freight is too expensive in addition to the taxes already paid. It's a shame, because I bought these socks before in US department stores and I never experienced these quality problems.<br /><br />If photos are required, I am pleased to send them to you.
B00KYB01DG|4|I like how it fits.  Falls nice without being sloppy.  Love the feel.
B006HH18NS|5|I really love this kilt. Well made, good quality.
B00C84P6DC|5|Just perfect!!
B002P1ZB06|5|They cost a little more - but are FAR Superior to any cheapies you will buy. They will hold up and last FOREVER - they are so soft and fit to perfection. Love Wigwam.
B00U4IONYM|4|Great price! Looks super cute on
B00P3DN5G0|5|These are warm, easy to put on and attractive. I like the concept of fingerless mittens rather than fingerless gloves, as I think my hands stay warmer and I can pull my fingers up inside the hand area if they get really cold. They are a little small for me -- I wish they came down farther over my fingers -- but I have large hands. I wear them with the cuffs folded up for extra length and wrist warmth. The lining is soft and adds to the warmth factor. A great fingerless mitten for the price!
B009CHPTSU|5|I read some of the reviews stating these ran small, I don't think so.  My son is average size for his age and they fit him fine.  They keep his hands nice and warm (and dry!)  We live in Chicago area so we need gloves like these!  I highly recommend them.
B00NC8L95M|3|I would definitely size up like other people had stated.  I was surprised that the arm length seems a touch too short.  I considered sizing up AGAIN  because of it but decided against it.  I just hold it holds up when I wash it.  It was cheap and I am only planning on wearing it to around the house, so I'm keeping it.  I'm 5'5&#34; and weight 124lbs and I ordered a medium just to give you an idea of sizing.
B001ELL6OS|4|Enjoy the bra...fits good...I have had a stroke so it is somewhat hard to get on but I can do it.  Great looking...<br />Thanks for speedy delivery.
B0010VR8TE|5|I loved this costume! It was a hit at the party that I went to! Looks just like the picture, no flaws!
B00KRV443G|5|Good quality
B00JBFX90I|5|Love the shirt! Bought it for my husband and it fits just as expected and the color is right on. It's soft and hasn't shrunk or had any fading yet after multiple washes. He loves it, one of his favorites now.
B0038KXV64|5|My babe always get lots of compliments when she wears this.  I adore all the prints, its so hard to chose, see her etsy sites for all the fabulous fabrics!  While I agree the price is high, I feel its worthy to support a mom start up business and made in the USA.  I've seen higher priced baby gear people use way less, I used this every day of the summer last year, and she still fits it now at 23 months.  I agree with other reviewers, it'd be nice to have some back of the neck coverage.
B00SA4Z2GK|1|too smalll
B0064EYBW4|5|Thank you service was fast and on time. Will use this product again
B00G2JAAQM|4|I probably would never have spent this much on a sash except that it was the middle of the night and I was not thinking clearly. However, not only did it arrive way ahead of schedule with a cute little note from Kiki, the sash is also made out of soft yet durable material, and I have no worries about the rhinestones falling off.<br /><br />Plus, the sash totally paid for itself in the amount of free drinks the birthday girl received while wearing it!
B002K8PFYQ|1|I ordered these shorts almost a month ago and they still have not arrived. On the day I ordered it did not say that they were out of stock however now when I check on it it says they are temporarily out of stock. I think if they have it for sale it should not take them a month to restock if needed! Seems like my  baby will have outgrown the size before it arrives! Heck at this rate it will be winter again before they show up! Very disappointed with this item.
B000J3GD04|2|Nice panties for the price but the size runs smaller than the size that I wear.  May have to pass them on to one of the girls!
B00NVSOL7Q|1|Runs small.  I'm a 14/16.  I ordered plus size because I wanted a comfy fit.  Bottoms only come up to half of my rear.
B00PQY8Z2K|5|i will keep claim
B0095FM56S|5|Fits me like a glove.. I'm 5'7&#34; and 130lbs.. Fits me just right, I chose a small. Kinda warm too.
B00GMUNX6K|5|Bali-Nique's silk scarf was beautiful and it made a wonderful gift.  The value was exceptional as it was truly affordable compared to retail store pricing.  I highly recommend Bali-Nique for unique artisan silk scarves and accessories imported from Bali.  Thank You!
B00AKSCXBG|3|Quite long and baggy
B006G7JXTA|3|purchased as a gift great price
B00UCG4WAG|1|DO NOT BUY THESE THERE KID PANTS FROM VIETNAM, NOTHING LIKE THE MODEL IS WEARING, COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME....
B00NJG3DNS|1|Runs way small. Had to give it to charity.
B003DHSE7S|5|love it
B00K3JZC2Y|5|Bought this dress along with a similar sheath-style dress for a wedding. It fits wonderfully; not snug at all. It feels so comfortable while looking very classy. The material is soft and has a nice little swing to it. The style easily hides a little tummy bump while giving a slim look. V-neck is a tad deep, but not so low as to show too much. Falls about 2 inches below the knee, but the style does not look dowdy at all.  An absolutely beautiful, sophisticated dress.
B00EMG3VLS|5|I bought these as a shower gift and they were very cute. Very pleased with this purchase.
B004PKHZ5Y|5|Great hat with great shape. Fist perfectly!  Highly recommended!
B002BX3PBK|5|I have ordered from several other sites & this is the only one I recommend. The sizing & colors are right so you don't end up with something you didn't want. I'm very happy with all 3 sets I ordered & I'm going to order 2 more today.
B00DZPD518|5|I am a big fan of the Champion boxer briefs and the C9 ones at Target. Good quality, best cut and fit for me of any of the name brands that I've tried.
B00AOBFIPM|2|Returned it! The color is a little off... in person the color is a little more brown and the material kind of stiff and thin...
B00FN2JI08|1|Got as a gift for my 6 ft 200 lb 17 yr old, shoe size 11 1/2...there is no way he could get his foot through the opening. Even if he could, they would be too tight on his ankle. Made out of great material, very cute.  Just unwearable.
B00876TEYM|5|Previous purchases of wallet inserts were not of good quality and I wanted a better product.The wallet inserts from Leatherboss is of good quality plastic. They also hold credit cards and photos in because of the design so that cards do not fall out. This is critical for safekeeping your credit cards.<br />If you wish to be safe and sure purchase your inserts from a company that sells this quality product.
B00Z5BBPH6|2|The hat fits as expected, however they did send me the &#34;wrong color&#34;.  I just kept it, it was not worth the hassle of sending it back.
B0015PSED4|5|I was impressed by the quality of the material. Light weight fabric which is very comfortable for me. I wear that through the summer season and it's so comfortable that I sometimes forget I'm wearing a high suit.
B002QLXNT6|5|I absolutely love them! Had trouble finding some like these. Fit perfectly as average-sized girl at 5'5 and 140.<br /><br />and a plus ... hubby loves 'em too ;)
B001E60CU2|5|I am using this for my son's bring home outfit. It's so cute! I love the little bear feet, and the adorable matching hat. The fabric is nice, I plan on buying this outfit in more sizes later! The shipping wasn't amazing, but it was good still. Came on time. :) Overall I'm pleased
B00484D7BS|2|Obviously the picture depicts a shirt with a white, possibly cream, colored backround.  I received the shirt and its actually a light blue, which looks kinda dumb compared to this picture.  This is what \\"In My Parents Basement(the seller of this item) said about it: We only offer this shirt in blue however sometimes the photo editing software can cause confusing of colors.    -now I am an amazon seller, and if something is different from the picture guess what I do, PUT IT IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION    -thats all, you've been informed
B004ZCQ49A|5|Awesome socks for the price. Great quality fabric/stitching. Highly recommended to all ! Sizes run slightly smaller than norm. I take L/XL, they fit nicely, snug and comfy fit. Looking for cool rasta socks? GET THESE! :) Great staff/owners/management at BC!! Very compassionate about quality service/care. That is always awesome!
B000CCZI9Y|4|Nice jacket and good fit. No issues with anything except the picture has it looking grey. When you actually see it, it is more of a grey and black checkered pattern. As one can imagine this makes it browninsh.
B003ILHNSK|5|Super comfy, typical American Apparel crop! Cream is a nice color to wear with everything and the fabric is soft. Also, the one size fits all makes it easy to lend to friends!
B00KCS34IU|4|Beautiful skirt just too small to fit well
B003IBLDHC|1|On the listing it says that the size is 6 months to 12 months. Once I received the package it clearly says on the the packaging that it is 6 months to 2 years. That is a HUGE difference.
B0007QMUI2|5|Love these boy shorts.  They're comfortable, non-binding, don't ride up, and there are no panty-lines to contend with.  Wish they came in another light color besides white.
B00KTW56CG|5|Love love best t-shirt ever
B008OP6I04|1|I am very disappointed with this product!! The size XL seems more a S so too small that is!! I ordered the color Tam. It is a brown color!! Do not recommend to anyone this seller!! Horrible!!!
B004868OKA|5|bought this for my wife at Christmas time  loves silk sleepwear  colors to pick from were hard to choose because there were so many of them  I chose pink
B001K2LYN4|5|This is a great product for a man that is 6'4\\" tall.  It is the perfect size and length and he said these were the best ones he's ever worn.  They wash well and are soft and don't shrink.
B00FSBXMNI|3|I am pear shaped and ordered a small.  The bottom portion fit really well however the top portion was too big.  The wide straps felt like they would fall right off my shoulders.  Returned it.
B00BPXIQBQ|5|I give the product a 5 star because of the seller. They seem honest and want to do right by the customer. However, I'm going to need to return my product. I ordered an X-large and it was equivalent to a medium size. If you order, be sure to order 1 or 2 sizes up unless you want a really tight fit.
B00CJ3SAF8|4|I'm 5'3&#34; 118 lbs normally a size small and ordered a large, because everybody says they are small.. was a mistake, is way too big.. I love the material and the print, really nice top.. sadly I can't wear.. maybe my mom..
B00HZF9S3I|5|beautiful blue color as depicted. soft fabric that provides a nice swing when you walk. very attractive and hits just above the knee.
B00OS6M6GI|2|Shirt fits small and is not the same pink as shown in picture here. It is a light bright neon pink, not this darker shade. Also, shirt came in with no tags on it. For over $22 you would expect a new shirt to have the tags attached.
B002IRJNCY|3|This was a great wig for a men's 50 look, but we had ordered the Men's Rock N Roll wig and that one was more truer to Elvis.  This wig was great as a wig for a typical 50's guy, kinda slick looking.  I would recommend getting it, it worked great for our 50's party.  I only gave it three, because I think it is more a standard 50's men's look rather than exactly Elvis look.
B00KXEUX50|5|I bought these for my clinical (although in regular not in tall). They fit perfectly. The lines and material are smooth and flattering and it stretches like fitness pant material. It's perfect for PT, which is what I'm in. They allow me all the bending and crawling I need (and without having to worry about my butt hanging out).
B0007IQFRM|3|The good news is this wallet is easy to organize for all your credit cards and cash, and there's plenty of space so your not playing find the card. But the bad news is this wallet isn't just big, its a monster, I got it for my husband for Christmas for the distinct reason its a zip up, and it quickly became the biggest bomb gift, everyone thought it was a joke. But should you not care about this being enormous, then this wallet is fine for you.
B00EMG3U7S|3|Gerber always runs a little small. The quality is not nearly as good as Carters but since he will only wear newborn size for a few weeks, I am fine with Gerber. The actual onsies are not as cute as the picture.
B00M4919DW|5|A
B0074T7U1M|3|I've never written an Amazon review, but I was so impressed with customer service that I felt compelled.  The top was not ideal for me, and customer service made it right literally within minutes of my request to them.  The top itself is very soft, great fabric, just not exactly was I envisioned from the website and shorter in the body than described (mind you i am 5'10\\").  Should be great on someone shorter and more petite.
B00UHQRFGO|5|Lookes great after washing
B00GTL7Q74|3|I got these for my 1 year old daughter for this past winter, but the ankle is very wide so they slip right off whenever I put them on.  They are very cute and look warm, but they don't stay on her feet long enough to wear.  Maybe they will fit her next winter, although they don't have a hard sole so not really made for outside wear.
B00OFHM0LG|4|Runs big actually  could've  gotten a size smaller
B00JGQQRCE|3|brought that dress in size 16 w ..top fits me perfectly but bottom of that dress its much too large not for someone who don't have  very curvy hips..regular sizes are  so diff ,depend of company..
B00FDMURVM|1|Shipping wasnt bad, arrived earlier than expected. The bottoms were not as high fitting as pictured and sagged in the middle area. Buttons were literally falling off and I had to reattach them. Top was fine. Overall not pleased with the suit, feels cheap but I had amazon credit so I only spent $1 of my own money. I certainly wouldn't have spent more for it. Had I found this suit in a store & tried it on, it would have stayed there
B000UZX7AA|5|I bought this bra because of the amazon reviews and I am so glad that I did. It is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn.  I love it.
B00E8LSWXE|5|Excellent quality and color.
B009WB90X6|5|Excellent !!! Good size for my triple double DDD..love love love it... Getting ready to order different colors, but is a little prizzy..
B00AFCOJ00|5|Great item - great service.
B00DT701FU|5|This feels like your old worn in t-shift, soft and comfy. Add in Tator/Grumpy Cat and now this by far is my favorite shirt to wear.
B0058YPYU4|5|Overall great quality jacket. The price wasn't bad and shipping was quick, as is usual with Amazon. The jacket fits well and is ver y comfortable. I would've preferred the orange over the red one but couldn't justify the price difference.
B005DEQRXW|5|this was bought by me as a gift for someone to be given by someone else, so i really don't have much knowledge about this coat.  it looked great when it came and i'm told it's a warm coat(the temps have been running around 10-30 Fahrenheit around here lately) and it fit well.
B009FEALGA|5|I was kinda worried that it wouldn't fit as I like to try on my clothes before buying but it fit perfect and looks just like the pic. I'm 5'8, 125 pounds itf that helps anyone.
B000HVRK6E|4|These are nice thigh-highs, with comfortable lace bands that stay up.  I gave four stars because the one thing that I was a little disappointed by is how easily they snag.  The hosiery is very sheer and my slightly dry skin on my hands left tiny little pulls in several places when I put them on.
B004L8J0C6|5|Simple yet elegant metal collar stays.  They look good and do the job, but most importantly...they don't set off the alarms in the airport.  I highly recommend them over the plastic ones that come with the shirt.
B00F17KSC2|3|Nice product for the price.
B00JOTYTK0|5|This top is very flattering and feels great on.  It runs true to size
B00Y3SOGZU|4|Looks and feels great!
B00A7Y5LU8|5|love the  style color just too small does it come in  2x size ?? and any special info for returning for bigger size ? thank you , Iris Morrow
B00MNJNG0M|4|Look sometimes you gotta dress like a dinosaur. Everyone knows that.<br /><br />I'm 5ft9, about 140lbs (on the slim side & long arms), ordered an XXL :  not too tight, sleeves and chest-tube-part are long enough. Was the correct size for me.<br /><br />(the spikes are fabric)
B000ELVNVK|5|These pajama bottoms are really cute and fit very well.  The material is thin enough for wearing in the summer (but not cheaply thin).  The material is also quite soft.
B00I16HZS0|4|I like it a lot. It came super fsat! It fits a little bigger. I'm a shortie 5'2, and 150 pounds, and it is strechy enough to cover my bum, but it's a little loose in the tummy. It's really cute otherwise. Just hand wash it and then hang dry, otherwise the heat from the dryer will shrink and break the elastic!
B0038MNI92|4|more for fall than summer
B00A8MIFOI|5|Great fit, much less than dept. stores
B00JX4MN68|5|Very comfortable, perform as desired.
B004C8V906|5|Great product, thick yet soft. Very satisfied.
B007E81P1O|5|This is my new favorite shirt.  It fits nice as the waist isn't too baggy and it has more of an athletic cut.
B00JQRORK2|5|These knit boxer undershorts are my favorite.  They are good quality, and last a long time.  They are soft and comfortable.  I don't buy any other knit all cotton boxer undershort.
B00HQZ8NEC|5|The fit is excellent. Excellent quality, and very durable!!! They fit my son perfectly!
B00HWS59PE|5|Got here yesterday will make a perfect gift for my son!
B00C1QLURS|3|Lasted about 8 months, than fell apart.
B008MLEZO6|5|Great suspenders  new clasps almost never come off accidentally.
B009XDWDBO|4|I love this piece of jewelry. It's very attractive and looks as good in person as in the photo. My only disappointment is that the swivel clasp on the back has a tendency to swivel to the open position and the pin falls off.
B00AYZCG1W|4|Shirt is great, material is fine...neck opening is far too small and not comfortable. It is probably OK if you wear xl or smaller...I wear 3xl and have a very large neck...can't figure out why mfg. makes 3xl sizing w relatively small neck opening.
B00P0DQ28Q|5|I bought this waist trainer about a month ago and love it! I wear it everyday, when working out and going out and have noticed a difference in my stomach. My stomach does look flatter and less jiggly. I will be buying a second one real soon.
B006GDATTC|5|Working outside in the cold the worst problem for me is a draft or chill up my back which can send me into back spasms. The Flexees not only seems to hold me and keep me from chilling in that area but it also seems to make it easier to maintain good posture while bending and twisting. Of course if I am inside it keeps all the wobbly bits in place.
B002YOSISQ|5|Nice socks, thick and comfortable to wear. Great for leisure or sports such as golf. Quick ship time.
B00MMOVD76|1|Really cute hat but won't fit  way to tight
B0018OOHGU|5|Great jeans
B0018OFPP2|4|The standard in denim jeans.  I generally find Levi's a great all-around jean that wear nicely.  Issues I have had recently (last 5 years) are thinner denim causing shorter lifespans, but the 550s seem to be back to old standards, which is great.
B004OXOJNI|2|I thought this shirt actually had real sequins. In reality it only has a photograph of sequins. I'm going to send it back.
B00CRQRTA4|5|I love it! Thanks
B00GDQIG7Y|5|took it to Europe - wear it when reading - cannot be without it!
B00M2UQ816|3|Has a very classic fit, a little loose and very thin
B00WE5OK0A|4|The quality is good. The silk makes me feel comfortable. The size also fits me well. Though it's expensive, it's worth to buy one.
B000EVQJTQ|4|The description of this hat stated that it was made in Ecuador and blocked in Mexico. However, the label of origin in the hat says &#34;made in Mexico&#34;. Aside from that, the hat came in a special box that was nicely protected during shipping and provides a nice storage for the hat while on the closet shelf. It is very good quality, light and stylish with a nice sized brim and band, which has generated a number of positive comments in the few times I have worn it so far. Bottom line...Nice hat!
B00478SFSA|4|Another gift I sent home to a family member.  Its a nice long sleeved T-shirt.  However, the long sleeves hit right at the wrists, so if you prefer theym to fit a bit longer I would order a larger size.  I purchased a 2X and it fits in all areas but the sleeves are short.
B001AK859W|5|This was a big hit at the 70's evening event I attended with friends.  I am petite so the the length of the pants were a bit long.
B0031QRE9U|5|great socks for a dollar
B00BCX3KII|5|Fits great, awesome shirt!
B00EBRULAW|4|The socks are great and the silicon doesn't slip at all.  I have a very narrow heal and wish the silicon were a little thicker to help me but the sock is as advertised.  I gave a pair to my niece to try and she loved them, too and will also be ordering.
B001CMV1AS|5|We ordered these for groomsmen in a wedding. I was concerned about the color but it's exactly what I expected from the photo. We also ordered one skinny tie in clover green (but not herringbone) for the groom and it matches perfectly - I wasn't sure if their definition of clover green would be consistent among different styles.     The service from Tie Bar was very fast - arrived quickly and no wrinkles.
B00VRUH5QE|4|Wore it to my boyfriend 21st birthday and love it. The only thing I just wish the top just had a little more inches so my bra wouldn't have shown when I left my arms up, but it might fit someone different.
B009AFNCH4|4|Good quality purchase.
B0018TIEG4|3|smell bad
B0041EFELQ|5|Kept me warm on my trip to Hoth!
B00817ECB2|5|wash and wear well,
B008HS1VGO|5|I love these leggings, although they are more than just leggings.<br />They are warm and look and feel like substantial skinny leg cord pants.<br />The colors are wonderful as is the style.<br />I have two pair and hope they still are making them next year.
B00I0CPET2|5|Great fit.  I'm planning to purchase more. The material is light weight and flowing. Delivery was right on time with no delays.
B00EI8X3MC|5|My bras have never fit well until now.  Follow the sizing directions.  I have apparently been getting it wrong for years!
B00KNVH75M|4|I can still wear it, but should have gotten a size smaller..
B0084D5302|5|This is a great jacket . It is warm, water proof and packed well. It fit true to size. I recommend it .
B001NEKAW0|5|Good t shirt bra and comfy!
B001RNO3N4|5|aaa
B00GHR041A|5|Great price and a good variety of super heroes!
B00MBB3TSQ|4|Although it fit somewhat small I am very satisfied with the purchase especially with the price I paid for it
B0050AFXGQ|1|The shirts are just too too long for me. I don't like that.
B009DEPDLU|4|I am in love with these skirts! I ordered 3 of them and they are pretty darn near perfect! The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the light colored lined skirts are still see through. Be aware of your under garments with the lighter version of these skirts. Otherwise, I am 5&#34;7 and the length is perfect. They right at the top of my feet making them perfect to wear with flip flops and a cute tank top. I only wish the weather was warmer so I could wear them now!
B00MS9JTUS|5|I ordered this for my 4 year old granddaughter for school.  It's perfect.  Fits well, and has elastic in the back of the waistband (no zipper).  She easily pulls it off and on.
B00E0IYG9Y|5|I want to wear them forever. They're soft. Oh so soft. Like a pile of kittens suffocated against your legs.
B00NMBRZB6|5|Love it!!
B005LBYG4Y|3|I needed a dress for a Valentine's party, had no time to shop so I ordered online. I was disappointed when the package arrived. The dress material is soft ... a beautiful, vivid red, but the garment is cheaply made. There's no lining and it looks like a $30 dress, not a $100 dress. My biggest beef is that the \\"V\\" neck doesn't lay right. You'd have to be Dolly Parton to fill this dress out. Unless you're an exhibitionist comfortable with showing off your entire bra or what's under it, you'll have to wrap a big scarf around yourself, which is exactly what I did. That hid the only nice feature of the dress which is the side wrap. Boo hoo, definitely would not have made this purchase had I seen it in advance. Would some designer please bring us a lined wrap dress like the one Liz Claiborne made a decade ago? It was timeless and FABULOUS!
B000B45BWW|3|Belt was missing.
B00H42OILO|5|I love it.  Just like the picture.  The material is soft and comfortable.  My baby looks very cute in the outfit
B00TGNXT7I|5|Looks nice on her!
B00DWPDLBU|1|The picture is WAY off. The dress is probably six inches shorter than shown. It comes way above my knee, I'm 5&#34;7. Hard dress to pull off, the color blocks are oddly placed, it's not as crisp looking as in the picture because the waist area is not as delineated as shown by the color spacing. Pretty disappointing. Anddddd I didn't think about it, but don't wear the dress in football season or you will spend all day explaining your not a Broncos fan, but we're just looking for a cute dress.
B001AIWSA6|5|I would buy more if they still made them. They are very comfortable and fit well. They wash well and last  if you hang dry them...<br />no dryer.
B006L1XD5Q|2|first of all the color is different from what i saw online and the materials is very bad one washing and its gone
B00DSOGA2W|5|Unfortunately, I was too hopeful in my wishes for this to fit me. :)  Regardless, the company was very understanding and worked with me regarding a refund.  The product was amazing, it's just my shape that needs work. :)
B00KPDU6NS|5|grandson loves it, he can even put the glasses up and down on hia own.  he is 2 1/2 years old
B007BQM2B6|1|Shirt that was sent had the wrong collar.  So I am sending it back.  6 more words are required here.
B0001GL8T0|3|The colors are all brighter than what is shown. the deep forresty greens and blues are more like grass green and turquoise, and the gold is is a yellowy orange. Definately should be used as a sarong not a wall hanging. Other than that is very soft and drapey.
B0058DH4E4|5|These are the best leg warmers I have ever had. They are so soft and comfortable. Couldn't ask for more.
B00HY3NHII|5|Love these shorts<br /> too bad the sizes run small or they would have been 100% perfect for me.
B001E1GCV0|5|This my go to brand for my son's dressy and semi dressy occasions.  I have bought this same suit for 3 years straight because it fits him well and the fabric is very nice.  Some boy's suits look cheap, but not this one.  The price has always been great on Amazon compared to department stores.
B006ZVYSVU|4|The size is not clear
B0057D8S9K|1|i loved the look of these jeans, however, when i received them they were honestly like a 00 with a maternity panel. Most smalls in maternity are too big on me (pre pregnancy im a size 3 and 116 lbs and i usually wear a small or xs is  most maternity)These fit way tight, im only 9 weeks and i couldnt get these up past my knees. needless to say i had issues with the shipping and the product was a no go, all together not a good product for me. if your super tiny then yess these would be wonderful but again if your over a size 1 pregnant, then im sure these wont fit
B00S7ZRB7U|5|Great
B005SW50X2|4|Same old, same old.  If pants/bottoms fit me in the hips the waist is going to gap. (I didn't knock them to a three star because it happens with most pants and I just take the waist in)  I have about a 8 inch difference between  my hips and my waist, so maybe someone with a more H shape body they would be perfect.<br />Fabric is sturdy, the pockets don't suck.  I like them.
B001CCMPBM|5|Wish the wigs would brush out better
B00TL6R9V2|5|Very cute. Love the design. Get a lot of compliments. But I line dry fearing shrinkage in the dryer.
B00TXX1UB8|5|In love with this dress ended up getting 3 of these in different colors
B009S3GOKU|5|This is just a Beautiful gown.<br />I will be wearing this for my Nieces wedding Saturday.<br />Just a pair of earrings is all this dress really need.<br /><br />I am wearing pink feathered pumps to go with this.
B00JQRHSK8|3|it feels good,but it is a little small, i will choice another size next time!
B00M0HR482|2|Nice dress but wasn't I was expecting to wear towork its more a dress up.
B005GMXPOA|5|Excellent frame! I love how bold and legible it is. Looks great on my car. I recommend this purchase. Don't hesitate to buy this license plate frame.
B007P3RHYC|5|These pants are very comfortable and fit well. They are made to last and wash really good. This is my second pair.
B00DMEFTLQ|3|My dress came with stitching that was not fully attached.  And the bottom hem was a bit frayed.  Hopefully seller will refund or replace because I love the color, fit, material, and pattern. I am 5'4 135, 36d and the l/XL fits perfectly as the other reviewer indivated. Overall the quality looks good other than a few sewing mishaps, therefore I don't give it full stars.
B0037269D0|5|comfortable and elegant
B00K596G5E|3|it fit as expected,but I did find them to be too long that they get a bit scrunchy at the bottom under my other shirts.
B00J5OM3O8|3|it is OK
B001HEF7TW|3|I found that these socks eventually stretch out, so I bought the small.  (1st time these socks were labeled zen-I have bought Dr. Specified before.  They don't seem as thick as the ones I've had before.
B005LCMOW4|5|My dad loved it. He loves the color, the fabric and it fits perfectly!
B0026OUTYA|5|Excellent cost benefit and also very comfortable. Can also be used for work.
B00BF3WUC2|5|This is a delicate piece of jewelry and it dresses up any scarf of any kind of material.  I recommend it!
B000TCWVOW|4|At 5'6\\" and 110 lb, I ordered size small. They are tight overall, but especially small in the calves, and the ankle holes are tiny. I had to struggle to get them on. The material is not very stretchy.<br />So for me, they are more like footless tights.<br />The material is nice and thick though and they were comfortable once I managed to get them on my legs. Color is rich and even throughout.
B0009K5UJW|4|Yes, the bra runs small in the cup area.  However, that's what the bra is supposed to do.  I'm a D cup and this bra makes it possible to wear tighter fitted, button down shirts without the buttons bulging & making my chest feel like it's being crushed.   <br /> <br />Recommended for the larger chested folks.
B00DGYGJ7U|1|Too big on the top and real small at the butt
B00AB3DIU0|4|Blouse is comfortable and stylish. would recommend but order 1 size up I think you will get a better fit. Especially if you have large breast. Mine were a little squashed
B005O33LJA|5|I rate this item at the top of Men's T-Shirts.  We purchased them several years ago, they have worn with great strength and durability.<br />the process in which they are made helps in holding the shape and comfort.  The only reason I am replacing them is it is nice to see your hubby in a bright new T-Shirt.<br /><br />Somewhat organized.
B006TW3A0U|5|This is a beautiful and soft little dress. It is amazingly beautiful and lovely. I would recommend this dress and this buyer anytime.
B008KK1L64|5|Perfect 3 piece outfit for one of our Texas winter days.  Sharp looking and priced right.  Launders well.  Every little girl should have one or two in their wardrobe.
B00076ZRBY|4|Size fit as expected.
B00FRAQN8G|1|So the dress is incredibly cheap and completely see through. I can't even wear it. Won't be ordering from these guys again.
B002YBVSYU|5|It fit not to small and not to large that's why I rated it (Fit as expected) there is not anything else to choose from
B009WSPVFA|3|Very pretty dress seemed well made. The problem was I do not have a very large bust (34B) and this was too big around the bosom. It gaped open too much. The fit was fine everywhere else. Had to return
B001D21QLQ|3|When this mask arrived, I quickly discovered that it was a women's mask. Since I am not a woman this is a problem. Mostly, this was my fault, as I was in a hurry and did not look closely enough. An improvement to the website might be separating the masks meant for men, women, and children into different categories. Also, the mask arrived broken. As usual, UPS did everything in their power to mangle the package into an unrecognizable mess. Upon calling the vendor, I was immediately given a full refund, no questions asked. All in all, next time I want a mask, I will buy from this vendor again, I'll just try to use different shipping arrangements.
B00A219DGY|4|if you order thes go up one size, im one handed and its hard to button them other than that they ar great very durable, i was taught when you order somethingby mail it yoursno returns,im only 49 but i still respect that
B00PGX6V54|4|Naketano makes some really nice clothes. This was my first shirt from this company, and I needed some getting used to it. The tied strings on the side were weirding me out at first, and I considered returning it. But the shirt is soooo soft! I am a sucker for soft fabrics.So I decided to keep it. After wearing it a few times, I decided I liked it. I do wish it was just a little bit longer, but other than that it's a really nice shirt.<br /><br />I am 5' 2&#34; and 125 lbs and the size small fits great - not too tight and not too loose (just loose enough not to show every roll). Just very comfortable. I washed it a few times (gentle cycle in washer) and it still looks good.
B00IUM8LB0|4|Great jacket
B00EK0HLXU|4|My daughter is 4. We ordered the 6/7 and it fits her perfect. She is somewhat tall for her age and thin. But will probably outgrow this within 6 months.however,  It is well made. (Just not 5 stars because it runs so small no way would a 6 or 7 yr old fit the 6/7 size)
B0041EFERK|5|It's nice that they are made for tall men. They don't creep down into my pants like the short ones do.
B006G7JXN6|5|These little white socks have held up well, are a perfect size, and are a great price.
B00WS51BX0|4|Great product. Cant complain
B004BCXFLO|5|My 13 year old grandson picked this out for himself. He loves it.
B00SCEVMMG|4|I like the belt, but the price is a little high for a belt of this type, they are usually in the $5 - $15 range. But I needed a dark brown one in a hurry and didn't have time to shop for one, and this one had Amazon Prime shipping so I got it anyway.
B00C1Z2O10|5|I have searched for years for a comfortable, well fitting, supportive sports bra. I finally found it in the Glamorise Double Layer sports bra. You can't beat the price!!
B00N9X156I|5|Arrived before expected time , beautiful lovey purse and i will definitely be buying from this company again in the future.
B00651QU8O|5|My wife absolutely loves her Christmas present!  The ear muffs are warm and also nice looking.  She will get years of wear from these real fur muffs!
B00FSR341W|4|The dress feels great. The dress looks good on me and yes you will need to wear something underneath.,it was pretty true to size just a few inches larger but that me being cute. If you have no shape don't bother  it will be loose and all kinds of weird.  I want more .....
B00T5V76E8|5|Fits nicely!
B00NY2B5T6|4|I LOVE these socks! I got a black pair and I can't take them off. My one thing I don't like about the sock, is that I am very athletic so my legs are thicker so the socks don't go as far up as the girl in the advertised picture. But that is just nit-picking. The socks are great!
B00RTBVD0O|1|Horrible! It looks NOTHING like the photo. It's cheap cloth and material. The padding that looks like a sexy bra like thing that covers the breast, actually is more like a swim suit insert pad. (Those awkward triangle shaped things inside the swim suit.) it fits awkward. Too large in some spots. Too small in others.
B004GXAB5G|4|I love this dress, looks good with everything.  Just wish it came in more colors and was a bit overpriced for the cotton material.
B00SOKYLR6|1|I could not believe it. Way too small.
B007V8FJR8|3|the shirt is ok, not durable though. faded after the first wash, runs small and shrunk. good for a quick outfit, not for a long term addition to a wardrobe.
B004R8VMHQ|2|For some stupid reason some of the Dickie's shorts have belt loops that are too short for a normal belt. The rest of the shorts are great - just the belt loops are a problem
B007SM874Y|5|I wore it almost the way it looks on the picture, everybody around me loved it.. It's looks very cool and it feels very light.
B00LA3K9WK|1|This said one size on the sizing and after I recieved the package, the leggings were labelled a size 2. WAY too small!! Had I known, I would not have ordered this.
B001JE4XJU|1|I bought these to wear under a tight leotard to hide nipple show-through. Instead of smoothing the area out, it drew attention to it, looking like my nipples were huge and slightly poofy, so I ended up not using them. Too small in diameter to really blend in, and possibly wears out after 10 uses (according to the box)? Won't work under a tight, gymnastics-y fabric leotard... like all the leotards these days!
B00IWFPKCI|2|Above image showing 4 quantities, no option to select the different colors.Quantities aren't clear.
B00ACIGM9S|5|Great product at a great price.  Couldnt ask for more.  I will most definitely be back to order more in the future
B00EH8MQTO|4|Bought this for my friend. Really nice dress... The pattern isn't exactly as shown in the picture. The coloured bands are slightly rearranged. The included underwear was really huge. Overall, the dress fit well and looked as vibrant as the picture
B0057XBEGE|5|My husband wears these everyday in summer. He loves the snaps and the fit. They are a great buy for the price.
B003NTY5XI|5|We got this for my little girl to wear to her brother's soccer games and she got so many compliments!  She has hardly anything but peach fuzz, but they stay in all day!!
B00P1683UW|4|Got a few laughs out of this on my 40th birthday.  Fits well and was comfortable.
B0020B7VP4|3|This is an overall quality product. I just ordered the wrong size. It a beautifully made bra; I was hoping for a longer line. I just ordered the wrong size' instead of a 38 D I needed a 40 D. I would still recommend this product to family members and friends.
B006DRTMZS|3|I'm pretty short so I usually order mini skirts and hot pants and they usually fit nicely on me. This way WAY too short. The skirt in the picture has been photo shopped onto the model so the proportions are off in the photo. My butt was on clear display. This is great for sexy costumes though. My husband wanted me to keep it, lol.
B006VHY732|5|Exactly what our grandson wanted!
B0018OUOB2|5|AAA+++
B00KVN74WS|4|Great swimsuit for a romp all over other's civil rights! Perfect for the beach, barbeque, or to find a date at the next family reunion!  I can express my contempt for forced integration while looking like the sexiest grama in the trailer court!!
B002AES7EU|5|I bought this hat for a trip to the Riviera Maya. I wanted something would look nice, but more important, keep the sun off my face and neck.. while still allowing good air circulation. This hat accomplishes that very well.<br /><br />I found hats that were both cheaper and more expensive.. but I saw a Stetson.. at this price.. and I had to try it. Very glad I did. I bought the Lg/XL size as that is what I tend to wear. Fits perfect. Others have mentioned the stretch band.. it really makes the fit.<br /><br />Nothing coming unraveled. No poke-y straw pieces anywhere. Simply great quality for the price, and the quality is awesome for a &#34;straw hat&#34;.
B004BG3IP8|1|For my 15 year old very small built granddaughter this vest was great.  But it said it was for a women, who wear XL, such as myself.  Not true.
B003NSBVLS|5|Hands down THE most comfy, truly \\"barely there\\" bra I've ever worn!   It's soft, the sizing is so simple, and it fits beautifully.  Bought it in all colors and there's just not another bra like it!  (and the pricing is great!)  Try one - you'll be so glad you did!
B00NB4MS2A|5|Nice tie and well made!!
B00NPBPJJI|3|Not to durable. I winter and they are torn already.
B00MFRTV8S|5|Exactly as advertised, exactly what I wanted.
B001B9XI3A|5|Great
B000M9JJ56|2|This item was returned instantly, cut way too small and the quality not to my liking. I had asked about cotton only which that wasn't on top of it.<br /><br />Twenty more words not necessary,explanation already obvious..
B00LHVA9UC|5|very comfy robe.  i had planned to give as a gift and decided to keep it myself.
B001MXKETG|5|Fits great, feels great!  Very sexy
B003LVY7HM|5|Perfect modern fit like almost &#34;slim&#34; but roomy...and wonderful color! I'm ordering two more again to complete my new set.
B00IWPM2HE|5|I am wearing this as I am a school teacher and needed something longer so I don't accidently bend down and flash the kids. The rule is no boobs, butts, or belly bottons for teachers so I needed this flowy cute cover up. I am going to wear it with a dark wash jeans.
B004CO4OV6|5|Perfectly flawless transaction and quality product.
B008GHRCLO|4|This item does in fact fit like they say they will, which provides an added bene&#34;fit&#34; in that they do not sag, needing to be continually pulled up all day long, like typical tights that tend to &#34;pancake&#34; the buttocks would.<br /><br />They provide a fair level of support at 40 Denier, and are indeed semi-opaque but they do require a bit more effort to pull all the way on/up than lighter weight fabric would. This also is necessary to accomplish the &#34;thong&#34; like effect.<br />HINT: (dampen your hands, wrap both hands fully around one leg at a time, starting at the calf, then gently pull up, then repeat about every 6-9 inches all the way up to the &#34;panty&#34; part.) You'll get a really nice, snug and individually contoured fit on your buttocks.<br /><br />The fabric seems to be more resilient than many, yet is silky smooth and the black evenly shades the slightly visible flesh color of your skin underneath.<br /><br />The item is a bit more expensive than somewhat similar items but has some advangtages that it seems justify the price.<br /><br />This is a very nice item. I'm going to also purchase the nude color to see how they look.<br /><br />Will weigh in again once we have some wear/resiliency results to report.
B00I8AZQ2Q|1|it is to small how can i sweech to a biger size
B000A38CXO|4|Great quality, but a bit on the large side.  Maybe it will shrink a bit after washing.  I would definitely recommend this jacket.
B009PT26F4|5|everything's Shiny.  Fast shipping too.
B001RNO3NY|3|Thin.
B005SN3FHO|5|They are so elegant! I was very surprised with the quality of these gloves. They are super soft and silky, very comfortable to wear, and stay above my elbow - they don't slip down with movement. The fingerloop has held up so far, no issues at all, arrived very quickly. I have slim arms and they fit perfect, not very stretchy, so I'm not sure how they'd fit with bigger arms, but for me they are super comfy! I am very happy.
B009YRBLQM|5|Product arrived on time, in perfect condition, fit well, lightweight, comfortable.
B008L43L44|3|These jackets are sewn in a basted-stitch style, which doesn't show in the description.  Meaning, that 'basting' stitches line the jacket edges, pockets, lapels.  That's a deliberate style -- supposed to remind you of the jacket just before the tailor removes the basting -- which sometimes looks nice, sometimes doesn't.  Well, I don't like that style.  So I'm returning the khaki jacket (Prime free returns), without even opening the nice clear bag the jacket came in.  It is well wrapped.<br /><br />It's a nice length, 30\\"-31\\" (I measured), depending on your own bustline.  Buttons are two-tone with a gold-like rim.  Khaki is true khaki, no camel 'nuance' in the shade (when viewed in sunlight). Fabric is 97% cotton, 100% poly lining, seems a nice cut.  Weave is like twill, but softer.  The length is the main reason I wanted the jacket, but I don't like the basted-stitch style.  Maybe you will.
B0008IVCPQ|4|Thhes jeans fit me just right with a little room to spare. i was surprise at how the fit me.
B0043O31XC|4|these pants work out great for wearing to work daily!  good price!  the only pants that I bought and they are long enough!!
B00BFASC9K|2|The fit on this costume wasn't bad except for very tight elastic in the upper arms.  I'm returning it, however, because the sewing on the front where the bodice comes to a point and joins with the skirt is off.  It pulled to the right and looked really bad.<br /><br />I'm disappointed to find out that I'll be charged a 20% restocking fee.  If the costume had been sewn properly, I would have kept it.
B00HI0IIM2|5|I am 5'4&#34; and about 115lbs the one size fit me perfectly from my hips to my ankles, the pants are sooo soft and not sheer at all. If you're thinking about buying them, definitely do!
B00HNEYURA|4|I bought it as a gift for a friend. fits okay. It seems to be an iron-on application which is not what i was expecting, (which was more of a silk screen type). Oh well it was liked anyway.... I guess that's what matters.
B00EI53ZAA|4|It was larger than expected but it serves its purpose. Great value.
B00V2NML0Q|5|Have you ever been to a restaurant, movie theatre, work or your favorite tavern where the AC is blowing so cold that you wished you had a small jacket?  Well, this item fits the bill.<br /><br />I was looking for something very light and the consistency of a long-sleeved t-shirt except in jacket form (i.e., something totable with pockets and a zipper).  I did not need or require that the item be lined, be made of fleece, etc.  At 6 oz, this item is light and fits like a long-sleeved t-shirt.  Quality seems good, washed well, etc.  Size:  I am a true XL and this item seemed to fit just a bit larger.  However, at 90% cotton and 10% polyester, it appears this item may have been designed with a little shrinkage in mind.<br /><br />Overall...this is exactly what I was looking for and would recommend accordingly.
B00FR9EKAU|5|just what I specified in my purchase, and the size, very comfortable, arrived at the required time, if required to make a purchase of this type of article this is the place.
B00AQW6W7W|3|the material look cheap, oh well it's cheap too, so buy it at your own risk, because i didn't like it as much. totally different with that picture.
B00TWXRA18|5|We have a Pi Baby who wants a Pi shirt for each birthday. This was perfect!
B00DYAYVLW|5|I love it!
B0072OHWTY|5|Always thought I had a big dome, but my XL was a tad large.  Figured the Large would be a little snug, so I just added a little sizing strip around the brim and I'm good to go.  Couldn't be happier with look and quality.
B00E634AJ4|5|This outfit is very versatile.  Each piece can be worn together or separately.  It is well made and certainly equals or surpasses anything I could purchase in a kid's department of any store.<br />Great outfit for the money.
B00CRLLOM8|5|love it
B009P2P6R6|3|Nice belt... I question the grade of leather.... I am disappointed that the belt is made in China! :(
B002EL2WRW|3|I have it in mind to return this. Its a nice wallet, but due to california's proposition 65, they are forced to disclose that the materials contain substances on proposition 65 that are known to cause cancer, birth defects ot reproductive harm. Thats scary and nowhere on this site does it say that. No where. Also made in china.
B008T0RXVM|3|This is a beautiful, designed vest, however, the pockets are narrow and shallow, thus limiting accommodation of items to just a pen. The vest hugs the body firmly and adding the beeper and cell to the short pockets requires unbuttoning the vest. The vest runs generally small and is not true to size as compared to other well named brands like Cherokee, and Dickies. This vest was designed with emphasis on style with camouflaged pockets, hence a three rating. I will recommend it, but take the next largest size for practicality and comfort during work on a busy floor; and if you prefer a fashionable, flirty, fitting, vest then order your true size.
B0027VT614|5|Very curly wig. I would recommend
B00DQYH5SC|5|hubby gets tons of compliments on this shirt  it  is win win ....breaking bad  fans  just love  seeing walter white
B00CRML06W|3|This is saggy and baggy but I find myself reaching for it when I go to the pool, over other options. I had to knot the shoulders so the dress covered my chest, but that worked out because now it is empire-waisted, which fits over my various skirted bathing suits. Thick t-shirt material but again, it works just fine. It actually looks sort of cute.
B002K6F7CS|4|Everyone has recommended to get a size bigger than your normal. I did and it fits good...at first! After wearing for a few hours the jersey stretches out a bit. The elastic under bust of the bra is tighter than normal so I can see why people recommend the larger size. If you have an average or smaller than average chest cavity then get your normal. I would rather have a little tight boobs than unsupported ones.<br /><br />Very comfortable otherwise. On me the strap lengths could be a bit shorter but it is not really a bother. I am sure it will shrink some when washed which is being done now. If you are not sure about your size then go for the size bigger because it's not that much bigger! I do want to get more.
B00DV8SIFW|4|It's perfect
B00UYS5G7U|5|Glad to find this body shaper! The quality is good and it suited on me perfectly as expected for its flexible sizing. Even I feel so comfortable using it. The felixboning supports are so well made. Undoubtedly it's an awesome body shaper!
B0092XAB64|3|It has strange white lines on it but for the price it was a good deal. I think they did a great job with the top just not the stick
B00UF7XUTG|2|Not a class act in looks. It is poor quality and snug on the chest although ordered per my size. Would not order again but will give to a youngster I know so not to hassle with returns.
B00FQVWF92|5|This scarf is much prettier when you get it than the picture depicts. The fabric is really nice and the colors are beautiful. It has Jerry Garcia's signature on it,which I don't mind, but it's easy enough to hide if you don't want it seen. It's a great length for trying different ways to wear it. Great find. Shipping was fast.
B00MMMI8XK|3|look like great pants but definitely run small.
B00JKQSVD8|5|I am 45, runner, swimmer and work out regularly, These are the best sports underwear I have ever purchased.  They feel great!  No chaffing, they dry quickly when they get wet so perfect for the summer, swimming and beach.  I have tried everything on the market and these are by far the best !  I will use nothing else and have bought a few pairs for my 3 boys.  They will live in them all summer.
B0018VFH3U|5|I bought it for my daughter and she is delighted with it.
B00PJ3GNB8|4|Love this shirt!
B001N7HMXM|3|I do think this little Braza is nice, but a bit small for most of things I wear.  I does cover cleavage though if you are going to Sunday School.
B00BBU4SJ2|5|We love this look on my granddaughter. She looks dazzling and prances around like a little princess. Very good design.
B00TS838KY|5|I declare a 100 percent satisfaction with the quality of your Rabbi full body Tallit I purchased from you.<br />Thank you and G-d bless you as I have been blessed.
B0014W4IRY|5|I was looking for a perfect skirt to wear with boots and long sleeve T-shirts and this was it!  The fit is always great with that little bit of stretch and the material looks and feels very good.  For this much style, the price was truly amazing.
B008B9B4O8|5|I have bought and returned multiple pairs of shorts this summer. These fit perfectly and stay in place. My daughter loves them. very happy!!
B00843CC1U|5|Nice T-shirt for my teen  niece. She loves it.
B00VTYQGFO|5|Fits better than expected for a one size. Normally a size M and fits wonderfully. A little shorter than expected but still love it.
B008P0M8NO|5|this dress is simply amaaaaaazing cant complain very conservative too cuz i like to dress like that thumbs up yea
B00028B3EC|1|the waist is a full 4 inches higher than most modern cut pants / jeans. i bought 2 sizes, to no avail. epic fail.
B00HR50ZOM|3|This is ok. The snaps are a little hard to open. But nice suspenders.
B00DGKZFB0|4|I received my jersey and it was just as I imagined it, EXCELLENT!!!!! Great quality, price and it arrived in a reasonably short time.
B00F97BR9W|3|Maybe I'm an idiot, but I couldn't get the zipper to work.  I had to return it.
B004S06LMY|5|They fit true to size to me... Nice leg length!! And comfortable to work in!!
B0007YR8XG|4|The fit is great; I'll continue to order this bra as needed.
B0000ZFH2G|2|I bought these because I needed a nylon to wear with my shoes at a wedding.  My thighs are somewhat larger than most average plus size woman and these nylons rolled down and dug in to me so bad I had to take them off in the middle of a wedding and throw them out.  They went on me just fine but never fit properly over my thighs as pictured on the model.  Then my feet swelled and hurt inside my shoes.  I'm disappointed, the top band should be larger.  I even wore them with a girdle so they would stay up but they dug into my thighs so bad that I was in serious pain.  It's too bad too because they were really pretty; I loved the shimmer effect.  Buyer beware if your thighs are like mine.  I hate writing poor reviews too.
B00FJO27WQ|5|My daughter loves it.  Good quality, fits great, looks great.
B0045YMYUG|5|I really like my new hat,  great price great product!
B0084TKBEY|5|My youngest son ( 23 yearls old) has purchased many items from The Lees through Amazon and he is so happy with everything he has gotten so I decided to get this shirt for my older son for his birthday and I love it too. It did appear to be lost for a time and it did arrive a fulll week late. I blame that on out postal service and not either company. I will say the The Lees has been in contract with me the whole time making sure I am  satisfied . Good job guys ( and girls )!<br />This shirt is well made and so soft, I think it will be very comfy. I ordered an ex large to allow for the smaller sizes in Japan and also in case of any shrinkage( it is 100% cotton). My son normally wears a large. I hope that helps.  We for sure will order again from this company. In case you are wondfering when it appeared  to be lost it was lost around Colorado so it made it from Japan without a hitch but the tracking stopped in Colorado.  The Lees is a very reputable  company and  very attentive to their customers.
B00801Q9QK|3|The shirt is great only problem I had with it that the logo on the sleeve IS NOT PRINTED.. The shirt will only come with the front logo not with the dont treat on me snake on the sleeve...
B000KGK9OG|2|the 2 pant really was a disappointment...the zippers would not stay up and after three washings , they start getting holes in them...i have had jackets , shirts , and coveralls from carhartt and was very satisfy...carhartt has always had a good rep...but now I don't know how to feel................
B004YDS5E2|5|Must Have!!!  Highly recommended.  Purchased every color!
B00EF4ZO08|5|Very warm!
B00J8EUW4I|4|Great size. Didn't realize it comes with a bow tie, a bonus.
B003ODG00E|5|Our lil one is cozy in this sleeper. well made and extra warmth for a newborn to maintain his body warmth. of course he looks absolutely precious!
B004U7WXB8|5|Absolutely love it shirt fits just right beautiful design I would buy again. I recommend this shirt for anybody who loves turtles
B000ID4XBG|4|Really like this bag...  It seems to be holding up well and very comfortable to carry. I also bought a change purse, cut out the inside divider and use it as a camera case and we love it!!  The handles are a rubbery plastic and have held thier shape well.
B00CE1TFB8|4|The T-shirt its very good for the price. Maybe the tissue its a bit thin but it still good quality.<br />The Breaking Bad logo looks very cool and the stamp its made of good quality.<br />If you buy this T-Shirt please order a a bigger size than your usually wear so if you are a medium size just order a large and you'll be fine. I'll give it 4 stars just becuase maybe the shirt could be a bit more thicker.<br />Overall the shirt its worth specially for the price and if of course if you are a Breaking Bad fan like me XD Buy it,you wont regret.  Breaking Bad RULES!!!
B004XNA99C|5|Very comfortable work pants have had several pair, they wash well and keep their color.
B00K8QMCJS|5|Thank You!
B0014VHB7O|4|It was nearly perfect just lacking a little reality around the face and had a few spots where there was no hair covering the netting beneathe. but I still managed to look darn good.
B004JQOL1K|1|There is nothing about this dress that is attractive. I guess it is the kind of thing that you should not buy online.  The colurs run together like a sort of muddy black, is that a colour.  Of course being 5 11 it did not help, the thing just covers the hip and nothing more.  It is at the front door heading out to be returned.
B000H94AIW|5|This is a great jacket if you are looking for something that is truly waterproof. I have had a lot of weather resistant jackets that soak through after 10-60 minutes of being outside. This jacket is in the style of an outer shell so if you need to stay warm you should wear another layer underneath. This will keep you dry whether you are walking the dog, working outside all day or just live in Seattle.
B0089NM9RC|5|My husband loves them, that's all he wears.
B003MGNP56|3|I am a 34 B and the elastic on the top of the slip would not stay up without the straps. I ended up returning it and the company was very quick with my refund.
B00PSMMJ3Q|5|WOW, ok so I had heard some buzz around some of the sites I frequent. I figured what the heck I have been wearing hanes or other &#34;value&#34; pack underwear. Once I tried these on I have found what I have been looking for in an underware. The way the inner lining sets your &#34;stuff&#34; just makes sense. Try a pair and you will not be disappointed. It feels better than wearing nothing to me. I don't like freestylin' here in texas its a little hot. The materials these trunks are made of are extremely breathable and wick moisture at the same time achieving a cashmere like feeling and texture. This initially i thought would make me not like these briefs due to I figured they would be too hot. I was wrong...Completely.<br />**I ordered a pair of the Platinum and one pair of the Vibe. THEY DO NOT COMPARE SPEND THE EXTRA CASH FOR YOUR BEST BUDDY DOWN THERE TO BE COMFORTABLE! THE PLATINUM ARE 100X BETTER<br /><br />Please rate my reviews, Helpful or not!<br /><br />Thanks Y'all,<br />NG
B00JKUYEVM|5|My husband looks hot in these!
B00BXEEWCO|4|Just what I wanted.
B004UJ5PUM|5|These are my favorite shirts to workout in. I have them in several different colors and always got them on sale.
B003NX8DH8|5|Its so comfy and soft! My daughter is wanting one now. I guess i'll have to make this a family thing.
B001LGCHJO|5|I bought this shirt in the black and white in a small and it fits perfectly. It's really soft and comfortable material. I think I'll get more in other colors!
B00700ETU0|5|Me encantan
B007USB6K8|1|This product was not the size it indicated.  This dress was for a petite person size 2!!  It definitely was not a Large as indicated!  Will never purchase from them again.  Did not return it as the shipping would be more than the cost of the dress.
B0006GXON8|3|Not roomy.
B002AT5W9I|4|This hat has a small elastic band at the bottom, which is nice to keep the hat on the baby's head. The flower quality was OK, looked a little cheap. In regard to size though it is way to  big for my 3 month old and will have to wait. It seems a lot of manufacturers of baby hats make the diameter correctly but the depth of the hat way too deep. Overall a good value when other people are charging 20-30 dollars for a similar style of hat.
B00DWXJV84|5|My grandson was thrilled with his PJ's and couldn't wait to get them on.  They fit him great.  He's 6 years old, but tall and the size 8 worked just right.
B003VW6TQI|5|Excellent
B005W0LTNA|5|Product is just as described.  I have ordered 3. I am very pleased.
B00633UOWW|5|I bought this shirt for my best friend and she absolutely loved it. The fit was perfect and the quality of the image on the shirt is fantastic.
B00IHUYWO0|1|Yikes! Somehow I misseed the fact that this dress is a cheap synthetic material, I must have misread as I was expecting a jersey cotton.  Not even sure I'd use this for a bathing suit cover up. Just not appropriate for me to go out of the house in, the back rides up and even the front is not flattering enough to want to get away with it. Maybe when I was 18, 110lbs and on a trip to Mex, but just won't work for my lifestyle. I'm 5'7, 145, I ordered the large, it's too tight. I gave mine away as everything I order on Amazon has to make its way all the way down to me in Central American, so returns are a hassle. I can only recommend for a young, slim, perhaps dance club dress.
B00G0LTQ9Y|4|My was born 7lbs 8oz and his baby pics came out amazing. They were taken at the hospital.
B00FFXEL70|5|Excellent quality. My daughter love it
B004XYPKVI|5|Awesome socks.
B001PUFK90|5|got this for my pillow boy for my wedding - it looked adorable on him.
B00UT67ZLC|1|The top is good. But the trouser  is a very  low quality  material and not folded as it is on the picture here. So annoying .
B00W035YMO|5|I bought these leggings for my daughter who is on color guard with our local marching band. she absolutely loves these for practicing in! She says they are very comfortable and don't ride up when she's twirling her flag. Highly recommend these.
B00HQ1B5NC|5|I'm 5.64 feet and 124 lbs, the tights (Size E/F) fits me pretty well. The leg is very tight but the panty is a little bit too long on the upper side, it can cover most of my stomach. The tights is pure white as the picture. It's not that opaque as I thought, but enough for this category of tights. Originally, I don't want this product, but it turned out to be a pretty satisfying tights.
B0074HD0HM|4|My husband said the coat was a little too short in the arms and too tight in the shoulders for him so we had to return it. However, it is a beautiful winter coat and very nice. Would make a good gift for a man that isn't broad shouldered or big-armed.
B005LJDKAC|5|I love this dress, I bought it last year. I was nervous about ordering it, but it came on time and great quality. I plan on wearing it for my 30th birthday:)
B0062QGFQE|5|Took forever to get here but that was my fault. I didn't realize the company wasn't in the US. Talked to customer service and they were extremely helpful. The material is very good quality- super soft and stretchy. Looks so comfy I wish they had em in my size!
B00I2CG3AE|5|Bought this wrap when I broke my arm and had limited mobility. I could not braid, tie up or pin back my hair so I used these when I went out in public. This one is the best of the 6 I purchased.
B005X5H60Y|4|Great support and fit
B0041EDS8M|5|Fits well, keeps my hands warm while my fingers are free.  Cute design.  would like them in more colors.  Allergic to wool and these are acrylic..  loving these!
B009FV8R7I|3|See thru
B00WO1IW1W|5|It has inspire me to lose at least 20pounds to fit it!
B00MVN9ECO|3|Runs a bit snug for a size 14
B00CL3ZMIO|4|Not often can u find a 3 Stooges product at such a great price and larger sizes. My son is a 3 Stooges nut and so glad I finally found his size in a less expensive t shirt.
B00I9FE3WE|2|It's made very inexpensively!  The gold charms do not have any weight to them.  It is a piece that will not last long.  BUT, it was inexpensive, so I got what I paid for.  It will be fine for a summer!
B00HI0ILJC|4|These are so darn cute. They stretch like &#34;old fashioned, normal, regular&#34; pantyhose or tights. I got lots of compliments. I'm a size 12 and they weren't as long and bunchy at the bottom as I like, it doesn't matter because I wore them with boots. Seem to be good quality and didn't have any flaws.
B00CZ504O0|5|Love these swim dispers, the are great Quailty, super cute designs, clean easily and drys fast. We have been using them everyday for last two weeks and its holding up great just ordered a second one.
B00C4YFGGS|2|The fit of the tights were not bad, but they had some kind of odor. I had to Freebreeze them several times
B003LNPB8E|4|Nice shirt little thin, I will never dry it! All in all a good deal!
B00FRPFXUU|5|Its adorable and my almost 3 yr old grandson Bradley hopefully loves it too
B00FQY3GLK|5|I purchased this as part of a costume for a 1960's character in a local theater group play. Nice quality great fun.
B00LGDZL04|3|Fit weird, and very cheaply made. Do not buy
B00I8IXPV2|5|I love this design and it fits very well, also I can wash it in the laundry. I can't find any better
B00IZCKKIC|5|I bought this for my daughter for her chorus concert.  Looked great and she loved it. She is wearing/outgrowing 12 so I got 14 and it was perfect. Washed/dried perfectly too!
B001CHK9WO|5|Great addition to the costume a little hard to breath but it looked great on. Make sure you take it out of the plastic to air out and take shape.
B00ANFVL82|5|I purchased this as a gift for a new mom to be,<br />she loves this item as it gives her room to move.<br />fast shipping too,, thank you
B005XLTH32|4|I really like these leggings because they are such good quality and the waistband is great but they are really long for me.  I ordered a medium and I'm 5'1&#34; and they are about a 8 inches too long.  I'm planning on wearing them still but may have to have them hemmed or just wear super high on my waist.  Other than the length they are wonderful. I also should mention that the waistband is nice and doesn't give you a muffin top.
B00FJ5LI3O|4|I like the Shark it holds as much as it is supposed to. It would be nice if the case were not to slick.
B00HVKOEVS|4|The scarf is great, it is thin and beautiful but HUGE. I mean it's this huge rectangle shape, with &#34;undone&#34; ends with a Burberry-Plaid-Check-like pattern that's absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately I am too petite for this (5'1'' - 110 lbs), but this would look amazing on a bigger, taller frame!! The length makes up for the thinness, big time!
B00C942S3C|4|Good fit. Fast shipping. Ok quality. Worth the price. Would purchase again. My 4yo loves the matching clothes for her and her doll!
B00NACKIC0|5|Great
B0099KFYT4|5|This is the second shrug I've purchased from Patty's and they are consistent with their service. The shrug is a light soft material. It fits in my purse if I am going out for the day and might need it on the subway. The last one I purchased lasted for well over a year even when machine washing a drying. You can also hang dry without softener because the material will stay soft. The sleeves are nice and long, so no worries there.
B0052T0ANQ|3|I got the kelly green belt - and it's more of a neon green. Just a heads up as I was expecting a more subtle green color.
B000LTP3AC|4|I would not truly know if it's fit well for an adult because I bought it for my four+ feet son who is too big for XL youth costumes.  However, considering how it fits in the stomach compared to the length of the legs, it's a little small.
B006YF78SM|5|These pants were much cheaper than anything I could find in stores or on other websites but they were exactly the same as anything more expensive out there! They fit perfectly and exceeded my expectations!  The material is thin but that is expected and nice because they aren't too hot to wear and comfortable.  They arrived way before the estimated arrival time! Great buy!  Can't wait to wear for Halloween!
B00WJ55AOA|3|Was just ok.
B00HR0TZI4|4|Loved the fabric and the look but Believe the sizing was off , I am tall so it was a bit TOOO short for my liking?i would suggest others try it if you are shorter under  5  6
B0002VN8TW|5|Am training for a marathon, and these shirts work just fine for endurance running
B007SNXGOO|1|I ordered a size 9 and got a size 3 but im sure if I had gotten the correct size I would be satisfied
B004FTPLRE|5|THE HAT WAS SENT DIRECT AS A GIFT, VERY WELL RECEIVED.
B000N8X64Q|5|I don't care about &#34;cool&#34; brands or what happens to be in vogue on that day.  I look for well-made products at a good, or better still, great, price.  That's what Dickies jeans provides.  These jeans seem to be as good quality as any of the more popular brands.  They fit me better than those other jeans.  They look perfectly fine.  And the value is tremendous!  This is my first pair of Dickies jeans, and I've had them for about a week now and they've been through one washing.  I'm sold on this brand.  I doubt that I will buy any other brand from now on.
B00CZ13B1C|4|I like these pants I'm usually a size 7 and fit ok.. I like royal color I got I will defenitely order another pair in a different color.. got them before expected
B00CTUKEQO|4|Love it, very luxurious !!
B00JDR9G0Q|5|Got the book quickly and it fit just like the other Pumas we ordered. My daughter is very thin and these fit her very well.
B00GV35J5Q|5|I gave this blanket as a gift. My friend raved about how soft it is. It's a lot bigger than it looks.
B00B7N9L2W|5|Very happy with the TShirt.
B008FW9DA8|2|I'm not sure if it was the tight or me but they ripped as I put them on for the very first time, rendering them totally unwearable. They would've been cute. I've been wearing HUE for years and have never had a problem. These might've just been defective or I wasn't as careful as I should've been when putting them on.
B00I3GZZXU|1|I was very disappointed in the quality. The skirt is made of a very cheap material and it was soiled.
B00QUFUUXQ|2|The gloves arrived on time but we're way to small!!
B00M1Z5ESU|5|Bought as a gift for my husband and it fits great. Good quality
B00H4I4O5S|5|Fit my wife perfectly, most comfortable yoga pants she's ever had. Cute as heck too! She's the hottest one in her hot yoga class ;^)
B009RVSBJK|1|I ordered a small.  When they arrived, they were obviously large.  I tried them on and confirmed the fact that they didn't fit at all.  Tried getting on the website but it looks like this color is no longer available.  If you have a small, please send it to me.
B00AH22ZCM|5|Soft cable knit style. Fits great and it's warm!
B008GTC9BU|5|What a beautiful skirt!  I love it, and I know my granddaughter will too!  It is a great slirt, and it goes perfectly with the jacket of the same color and style.  I am glad I found this on Amazon!
B002GYJJCS|4|The simplicity and beauty of these traditional designs are captured on this rich-teal printed-tiered skirt. This simple traditional style will add a fun touch to any wardrobe. A new look for any festival day. This printed-tiered skirts gives a unique and eye-catching look.
B007EYYK06|4|I purchased the coveralls for work. They fit and feel great. They breath well and are quite durable without being heavy or restrictive.
B000KGKBOO|3|i really like the coat i bought it during the summer in preparation for my winter working in Yellowstone national park. the coat is great but today the first day its actually cold enough outside to actually wear it. i  come to find that its a little to short it fits great otherwise and its very warm. since i bought it during the summer even though i havent worn it yet. its to late for me to exchange it for a large tall.
B00FBQ4T3C|5|These lenses are nice and definitely bring out the colors around you. I've had then for about six months now and they are holding up really nice.
B00H76EBM8|5|Perfect!  Great price!
B000JIH8X0|5|tried on this bra today and was amazed by how comfortable and supportive this bra is. I have yet to se how it holds up in the wash but it looks sturdy and I dont forsee any problems. so far tho, i LOVE LOVE LOVE this bra!!!
B00G7FSFQI|3|My husband loved it.  It was just the right size.  However, after 3 days the zipper broke.  The bag is being returned even as I write.  We have asked for a replacement since my husband liked it so well.  Fingers crossed on the next one.
B007AK1LW4|5|these fabulous socks paired with the wonder woman caped t-shirt and a skirt make a fantastic adult costume for Halloween or just for fun.
B00QMWC4SG|4|It works just expected more I guess.
B00A3FGXGC|4|Good
B004NREXSQ|1|The manufacturer claims that this hat is \\"BUILT DURABLY TO LAST THROUGH RUGGED USE.\\"  This is far from the truth.  Extremely thin material that absolutely does not hold it's shape.  The material that the hat is made of is too thin and does not hold it's shape.  The crown balloons up and down with the least amount of wind and constantly has to be patted down to fit your head.
B00M40IJT8|5|good product
B000VUGF0I|5|Over the years I've found Haines underwear; tees, briefs, and boxers, to be comfortable, reasonably priced, widely available, and long wearing.
B005GYGEXW|2|...since it's from spalding. but it's just another pair of your regular cotton legging, and it comes BIG!!! i'm hoping it shrinks after i put it in the washer and dryer, otherwise i had just wasted 20 bucks (cost with tax). if this is the type of legging you're looking for (cotton, kinda loose), don't waste money on these, just get those $6 ones!
B005VMUN3Q|3|It was everything they said it was except that it ran a little small keep this in mind when you buy.
B00H32XL86|5|I love Paul Walker and I dearly miss him so I thought that I could show how much I loved him by buying a shirt. And I totally love this shirt and it works for Male and Female.
B00LTHKDGO|5|ok
B0040K7JT6|2|The patterns and colors are cute and true to the photos; however, the fabric is extremely thin, shrinks in the wash and tends to bunch.
B00SIK8XO4|4|Good quality, too large
B0027VT5RE|5|Great costume for the price.  Quality is fine, no issues with it.  Just Iron it when you get it and it will perfect. Colors are fine and cape too.  I am  5&#34;6  and weigh 122 pounds. It fits fine. Obviously is short.  I hope this information helps you.
B00N71EMUI|5|Good! It's the thing I want.
B008TZWRD6|4|The image is a little bit less vibrant than I'd like, but for what I paid, is just fine. No complaints here.
B007VCHHX8|5|This was just beautiful when arrived.  Wasn't sure how it would look, but it is perfect to give as a gift.  It appears to be true to size, definitely not too small for size.
B00G9HKIBY|1|When I first recieved it one of the were ripped. And it runs a little too big.
B00AXYFCI8|4|Great quality!
B00H44YWVI|4|Jacket is smart. Haven't started using it yet so can't say how it holds up. But my son is 19 months and I've bought the 4T since he's well built as most reviews said the jacket runs very small.
B00NSJZTWE|5|Great for my 12 yr old daughter
B00JNB5XKY|1|No for me!  Cute on a smaller person.
B001FD6C26|5|This beanie is a wonderful product. It's color is good, and the cap fits well. I am very pleased with the timely delivery of this product. I was so pleased, I am planning on purchasing more in different colors!
B00TT463QS|5|Fits perfectly, that's why I purchased this one.
B007JY57D0|2|These were purchased for a one-time, funny wear.  Good thing, because 1/2 of them were broken when they arrived.  If you're ok with a pretty poor overall quality (meaning: No more than one time use), these are probably ok.
B006PGGJOE|5|Loved it; bought some for my kids and husband.
B00BJ7EC3E|4|These rib tanks worn as an under layer keep me warm in these cold michigan winters!  Exactly as I expected.
B00IS9LK1S|5|Perfect fit, exactly what I was looking for.
B00AJ34LOO|4|Great quality warm jacket. My son is tiny 30 percentile and I bought him a 3t even though he fits most 2t with room to swim. It's a trim fit. But at least a size up!
B005OJZXKE|5|this is an awesome scarf it has kept me warm thorough many cold and snowy day and nights while i was delivering pizzas to people
B006Z6F6ZW|4|Great product and price, but the color is lighter than red and almost looks pink.  Not so bad for a girl, but my little boy will be wearing almost pink pjs!
B00D1T73AM|5|Our twins look great in these!
B00GX2TOII|3|Not what I thought it would be- maybe it was too small, maybe it looked better on the model?  I'm slim, and built nice, but it was too small on me-*the small size) and it just wasn't what I thought it would be. DEFINITELY NOT worth what the sticker price was!!!!!
B00IBL0LYU|5|Nice and long as it should be.
B00O8N2VLQ|5|These are amazing.  My daughter is slim and tall. They fit her great and the material is very soft. I love them.
B00NKNG55I|5|My kid loves it.
B00DOY4YU6|5|awesome shirt. I like everything about it.. the fit, the comfort, the size, the color... I would definitely recommend this..
B00AKYZS2G|3|I was really looking forward to this skirt but when I got it, it was smaller than described.<br /><br />Just for you buyers to take into consideration when buying from the same brand/seller.<br /><br />Othe than that ... really cute skirt!
B00LSMB0C6|5|This dress is amazing. It is made beautifully and with really nice materials. It also came very quickly and the seller was very nice when I told her I needed it by a certain date. Definitely worth the money.
B00IMW60U2|5|I decided to gamble on this - the one reviewer liked it and the price was so low.<br /><br />What a great shirt. The fabric is substantial, the color and fit are good, and it is well made -  the seams are even finished.<br /><br />I just ordered two more...
B006SFSLHU|5|These pants kept me warm while walking through Beijing in February. Comfy under my other pants and great for sleeping.
B00E9H57I0|3|This product is a lot smaller than it stated.  It said 29  inches, but the holes on the belt are more for 23 inches.
B0010Z1EE0|3|Can none of you read??  if you read this, you should get the sizing right....    Product Features  Made of 100% cotton   T-shirts are form fitting and run small. S(0-2), M (4), L(6), XL(8), XXL(10)   1965 logo design printed in a rhinestone pattern   Machine wash cold. Line dry.   Imported
B00SSXO7KU|5|I was looking for a nice Thor hammer (nothing too fancy), that would look good on camera. I had a smaller one and I wanted more of an actual size hammer. This one is great! It's the right size and it looks good for a plastic Thor hammer.
B00FG6KSXC|5|What a beautiful dress. This is nice quality and will be very versatile. I really like the color and the fit. Well made and will last for several seasons. Thank you!
B00KBNMWUC|4|I love these skirts and I love that they're cheap. Also if you're a big girl like me you should definetly buy this. However, it's a little tight around the waist. It depends on how you wear it. Also it's short so I would consider wearing shorts under or tights. Other than that, they are so cute.
B004CMD5LI|5|This shaper is almost perfect.  It has a high waist and does not give me &#34;muffin top&#34; as so many do that fit right below the navel. totally smooths the tummy, hips and thighs.  I can't believe the difference in my appearance with this shapewear under a pair of trendy knit pants - no lines or bulges anywear.  I am usually an extra large in a shaper and am about 5'7 and 185 pounds. The extra large in this product was perfect and was not binding at all when worn all day. The fabric is sheer, but heavier than panty hose.  It looks very small when you pull it out of the package, but fits wonderfully. I don't know how it will hold up over time, but is a fantastic deal at $10.  I will be buying more!
B001CBZXRG|1|disappointed in cheap construction and lack of creativity beyond the concept . Flimsy... Had to beef up the hat with cardboard
B004RKEHK8|5|nice color and material
B000XTHOA2|4|I really like this wallet a lot! After seeing the one my mom purchased, I knew it would be so helpful in organizing all of my crazy cards that other wallet designs burst with. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that I wish there were a better slot to hold cash in. You have to fold it up and stuff it in front pocket. Also, if you keep change in there, it tends to fall out after the wallet has been jostled around a bit. But its still one of the best wallets I've ever had!
B0018OR118|5|No complains from my father-in-law. Fits him as expected. Easy to order. Delivered on time.
B007WPHOF0|1|Back is see through & very thin. Returned.
B00DF1NSIW|4|Love the wild color. Material is mainly cotton. Feels great. Not taking any chances thought so I am air drying after mating washing. The price is right. Toni
B0009GEMFY|5|I have enjoyed the comfort provided for bot in a social and work environment and thoroughly enjoy them. None better at such a good price.
B008UDUJWI|5|If you go by the measurement chart you shouldn't have any problem finding your size. It's got a little stretch to it so it is very comfortable. The only thing that would have made it better is a shelf bra so I wouldn't have to wear an extra garment but I can't complain. The tie dye is gorgeous. I ordered the purple and love the colors.<br /><br />Great for yoga or keeping cool in the summer time.
B000VZ5SG0|4|Bought this for my 8 year old daughter for her Coraline costume. Quality and fit were good, but it's a much lighter blue than the picture shows. Almost looks like it's blue with lighter blue highlights. Was worried because others were saying how short it was in the back. Turned out to be just the right height and I didn't think it was too short at all
B007UM6O7E|5|As soon as I put these on, I sighed with relief! I am short and curvy, with a 1-2 size difference between my waist and my bottom. These 529 jeans fit great, though now that I've had them on a few hours, I think I could have sized down. When my sister told me she bought literally five pairs of these in the store, I laughed. But now that I wear them, I realize she isn't crazy. I bought the \\"sunflower\\" color and they are light and faded but not destroyed looking. Love them and will definitely buy more, especially for the amazing price.
B002T2T7WE|3|Product was alright and usable, adjustments had to be made to the nose and mouth areas to aid with breathing while in motion.
B00Q6LHTFQ|3|I would give this dress five stars but it was much too short. I am under 5 foot 7 so it is too short for the average woman over 50.
B00QALCM0E|3|It's a very good coat.
B00JPL8VV0|4|The top arrived quickly and as expected. Very soft and comfortable.  Thank you
B00Q3M0DWO|3|I wear a size 12, ordered the large (12-14) and could hardly pull these over my hips.  They feel great and look nice once I wedge myself in but the effort to get in them is not what I expected for anything labeled pajamas
B001NXBQTW|5|These are my favorite bras! I have been buying them for years. The only ones I can find that fit perfect!
B008XHEFI0|5|Very stylish, functional and comfortable.  I love the color.  I am very happy I have this on rainy and cold days!!
B007AISFKW|5|My daughter said to give a 10 but I can only go to 5 so she is very satisfied and we highly recommend this product!
B000V5O6Y0|5|Pants were for my father-in-law who was very pleased.  They seemed like great quality pants and arrived within timeline quoted.
B0009GE2IQ|2|Nothing
B00Q6X5QZO|5|great
B00ED61KQA|5|I love these! I don't usually write reviews, but I am very impressed with these. They perfectly and the material is not at all cheap. I loved this product. I would recommend it.
B002Q749W0|5|This is the best scarf I have ever owned. It is super warm and cozy. It is nice and thick, and really keeps my neck warm on cold winter days. It is also beautiful, and not too itchy. I highly recommend this scarf, whether it be for yourself, or as a gift. Definitely worth the money.
B004IQLTRA|2|I don't know why I had problems with this product. One it is not as pictured. Doesn't include the stick or pot. Also it just wouldn't set right, the gel would pop out of the tooth, which is weird since the kit that came with my fangs had worked perfectly.
B00C6QPT3O|1|There is no way this is a large! I was looking forward to wearing this suit and find I can't even get my leg in it. It wouldn't fit my daughters barbie doll let alone a human being. Don't waste your money on anything from this company if they can't even have realistic sizing. I'd give 0 stars if I could!
B004BIRDHA|5|It shrank a bit after washing (washed in cold and dried on low) and drying. However, I LOVE the shirt!
B00JDCRE9Q|4|I like the style. It's too long for me. I'm 5''0 have to fix it up. Delivery on time. Thanks.
B0006SL924|4|I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks.  Something comparative at K&G would run between $15 and $20.  It has a $45 tag on it, and I'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I'll but 5 more of them.
B006C9VI9A|3|It is a decent shirt. Make sure to order at least one size bigger than usual. They shrink quite a bit.
B005FVQL2K|5|LOVE these bras!!!  They are so comfortable that I forget that I even have them on!!!  Such a great buy on such a great product!!!  Will purchase here again!!!
B0007KQHJG|5|My dad's favorite movie is Napoleon Dynamite, so I surprised him on Father's Day with tickets to a 10 year anniversary screening where I dressed in full costume and my boyfriend showed up in full Rex Kwan Do costume. Really fun!
B0088CXKUO|4|Good hat and for the price a good value.  Flap takes care of my neck and the hat takes care of my head.  Used at recent NASCAR race.  No sunburns here.
B00EEBBCVW|5|Fits exactly as the reviews stated.
B00IXK390C|5|The mesh is so cute!
B00PUDKKE8|5|I'm so happy that the shirts was exactly how we expected my husband love it.
B00FL89T6C|5|Thick and hard sturdy case. I love the purple and black. It's a bit bulky but that's ok.
B007JAA5W2|3|Design is cute. Quality of material is average. but it's a costume, so I expected that.
B0013PNEBI|3|Shoe runs very very small. I'm a size 7/1/2 and had to purchase size 9 1/2 for a wearable fit.
B004880WIK|5|I purchased these gloves for my husband for an upcoming trip. They arrived promptly and as described! Great looking gloves and fit was perfect! Would recommend these!
B00817E046|4|They fit good, and my son was happy that they are &#34;plain&#34; and had no decoration.  Sadly, NOT &#34;made in the USA&#34;
B00CE3BYUG|4|Ok shirts..not as thick as I'd like. .but good to print on....thanks
B00B8OZ75K|5|Rugged shorts with button snaps on rear pockets.
B009286PXM|5|Yoga pants are super tight but, are cute and comfortable. I bought two pairs and glad I did. Thank you!
B00LAF0FRC|5|My niece loved it.
B009FWR4NU|4|Nice veil! Long enough, pretty!
B0044VD8GE|5|I got this hat in the white! I absolutely love It!!! I want to get one in every color! I did order two by accident, they both fit differently. One was tighter with a shorter rim in the front. I liked the looser fitting one, with a longer rim in front best. I sent the other hat back. Hmmmmm.....maybe I should have santa buy me another color.....
B00CN5B8UG|1|The sweater looked so different from the photo that it must be the wrong item. The photo was of a pretty cardigan but I received a cheap looking pull over sweater. It was not a cardigan. My computer is not hooked up to my printer so I had no way to return it.
B00649UACE|5|I really like the fit of these jeans, but I am short so I bought what was called &#34;Short&#34;, rather than &#34;Petite&#34;.  I thought it might be about the same as petite.  But WAAAAAYY too long.  Does anyone know the inseam information on the lengths?  If so, please comment.
B00O7U0LI0|5|Very small sizes!
B00U2NBOZA|5|One of my favorite nursing bra. Soft fabric and it's so nice looking.
B00HQ741K0|5|I liked these when I saw them on Amazon, and had picked out the blue ones for self interest - but also had another pair that I was interested in that was almost the same color.  My BF really loved these swim shorts, and really liked the white/green/navy one, so I surprised him and ordered him a pair and got the other brand of shorts for myself.  He tried them on and loves the way they feel and look.
B0026RHF3K|4|Im 5'4'' with a 36DD chest and weigh 175. This outfit was very flattering but it was very large. I didn't return it because I knew it would serve its purpose!
B0098DARWG|5|Love this shirt it's rugged for my camping and fits perfectly.  Problem is I ordered Forest color which looks pink in the picture with a green going through the plaid.  I thought it was weird that it was called forest because it obviously looked pink.  Some color blind guy is posting the name and editing the pictures because it doesn't look anything like the picture posted.  It is a majority maroon and there is a grey stripe bordering on green.  Nothing like the picture.  But I still love it and am ordering the electric blue one.  Who knows what that'll look like! ;)  Don't care they fit and are warm for my campouts this fall.
B002S4KMKY|5|Best costume ever.  So easy and people went nuts over it.  At one point a hot chick took it an put it on.  Buy this if you want hot chicks to take it and put it on.
B00EBSIVB2|5|Very pleased with purchase.
B00DJGPNPE|4|I was going to return this beautiful top because it was too small but it fit a friend of mine so I made it a gift to her.<br />This is a stunning top, extremely well made. The beading adds weight but does not alter the drape. It is not a \\"tunic\\". It will depend on your height. On me (5'6\\") it came to mid-butt.  It is stunning!!!!
B007B8MN2M|2|Ok so first off the estimated delivery time wasn't posted to me before buying.... So even though I bought this on like the 4th of October the estimated delivery time was sometime in November! and I needed this by Halloween. So I messaged them and told them. And throughout the entire month of October whenever I spoke to them they just repeated themselves rather then answer my questions. It was not courteous customer care at all!!! Seriously for an ENTIRE month they just repeated themselves no matter what my question was!<br />So I finally just went out and bought a different wig for my Halloween costume and come Halloween, guess what appears in my mailbox. I was NOT happy. 1. They said it would be delivered to the door so I could either accept it or decline it. It NEVER came to the door. It went straight to the mailbox so I didn't get a chance to decline it and just send it straight back. And 2. IT WAS WHITE!!! I ordered the SILVER one. Not the white one... So it wasn't even the right product. And I know on this product it says Silver White but this is NOT silver. This is the whitest white I have ever seen a wig be. Seriously. No mistaking it there. Also it's not the right length even... 100 cm psh yeah right.<br />The wig is good quality, it's thick and very soft. Doesn't look like normal synthetic hair nor does it feel like it. You can't see the cap underneath and though it's a little heavy it's comfortable to wear. So for the price I'd say buy it but maybe order it like 1-2 months in advance of whatever you're needing it for just to make sure it gets there on time and you don't have to deal with their horrible customer care! The quality is the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars. And yes I ended up keeping it just because I can use it for a convention or my costume next year. But I will definitely not be buying from these guys again. Unless I have like 6 months to plan it out and know it will be here in plenty of time...
B00GKC76OU|5|Fits perfectly and looks very nice!
B00ISLOA2C|5|Adore the little me.  Am completely sad that they stop at 24 months.
B008TOZTPU|2|Like the previous customer, I also believed there were 4 pairs in this pack of socks. There is not; only 1.
B004W8GCVM|1|Well, I own several body shapers from this brand and I love them, that's why I was very disappointed when I tried this one. The fit is great until you get to the thights. It rides up all day!!! It looks really bad under your clothes and it hurts. Do not recommend this one, sorry Vedette...
B0006USFIS|4|Overall it's good a little snug but I can live with it. I would order a larger size next time.  I wear it 3 or 4 times a week and it has held up well I would order again
B00MWVSLNS|3|Fabric not the quality I expected.
B002GUH7LW|5|The jumper looks fantastic and excactly like the picture, the shipping price was decent and not over expensive like a lot of harry potter merchandise online. A good buy for a Potterhead
B00ISD1SSE|3|Not really usable,  but a neat gag gift.  Material is cheap and really not worth the price.  I did it anyway.
B0000TF5VK|1|I wish I had read the reviews before ordering these instead of just looking at the stars given. I ordered 2 packs and am returning them. Within 2 hours of wearing a pair, they had stretched out in the leg and crotch. I felt like I had a wad of fabric in my crotch. It rubbed and chafed. They need to put some elastic inside the cuff (INSIDE: not touching the skin or pulling hair) as the ribbing alone is too unstable and not a tight enough ribbing to hold the shape. I have worn other brands that had cuffs and they were great. Going back to Bali even though they are more expensive.  Barring that. I may have to start making my own panties again.
B00L8J15U6|5|My daughter loves this shirt.  It's sparkly, fits well, and has Elsa on it!  What more could a five year old Frozen fan ask for?  It washes well and I have had no problems with it shrinking.  Overall good quality.
B00MO85P4W|2|I bought XXL size and when I receive it I saw that it is XXXXXXXXX s
B00EBET1GU|5|I have several of these suits. For the price, they can't be beat. Construciton is good and you have features such as working button holes usually found on higher end suits. No, it's not a real Brioni for this price. If you were expecting that, you may need to do more research on suits.
B00NAQX7BU|5|Was very unsure at first but when it arrived it was exactly what I was looking for seriously perfect! Also really fast delivery, arrived way sooner than expected! Totally satisfied. :)
B00AX8VYYA|4|Great mask only flaw is mask is slightly shifted to right cuz of mold, and the strap is cheap but $1 spent on material makes an easy fix, looks great and wears great
B00KFEFHYK|4|It fits very well.. It helps to pull in my stomach.. I am a 24-25 waist. I got a small but I think extra-small..
B00HVE59F4|5|It appears to be an excellent value. Only worn it a few times
B00EXP5WL0|4|Neat little repair kit! Priced right!
B00029P5V8|5|This company has done a super job making these outfits and selling them for a reasonable amount. definitely costume quality but that is exactly what I wanted.
B00M1GD8GO|5|good minimizer
B00TAU1NPC|5|I thought the dress was lovely.  It turned out to be too young of a style as I am an older lady.  I returned it.
B00RMM184G|5|Pretty shirt.  Fits well.  Very sheer.
B005UGTQMW|2|Not what I expected in tights! Too think too pale and they are more like hose, not tights! Not happy, but gonna keep them for Spring time, just too complicated to return, but I would not buy them again!
B000OWC1N8|5|Sports bras, which I purchase exclusively online have traditionally been pretty hit or miss for me.  I really lucked out with this one.  It is the best sports bra I've ever bought.  I do aerobics, treadmill, stairmaster and running and this garment holds my large chest as stable as I've ever experienced.  It goes on like a harness almost, you really know you're wearing it but it's comfortable to walk around in and extremely comfortable to do high impact workouts in.  Fits me true to size
B001D4ZGUQ|5|great shirt
B00NB88654|5|Perfect fit high quality great price
B004WO412S|5|My 7 year old who has a small head and my 2 year old who has a larger head both fit in this perfectly. Great Hat
B00NG7CRVY|4|Nice quality. This is not for cold weather, but is a very attractive addition to an outfit. Comfortable and stylish.
B007GCBOU0|5|thanks!
B00MAVN0R2|5|Lots of slots for credit cards.  I like the flip out for your identification.
