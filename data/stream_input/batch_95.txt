B00KTNO1WQ|5|Installed on a 1969 nova these things are sweet
B0018C85VK|5|GREAT PRODUCT WRONG SIZE
B00W2XE3O2|5|These window vent visors work perfect on my  vehicle . I have a 2006 Chevy HHR.  These window vents  are not the ones that sit on the outside of the window. These ones fit on the inside of the window frame. They are very easy installation, it only took me about 15 minutes  to install all four.  I've had these installed on my car for about two months now and I love them they held up very well. Everything came in the package that was needed for the installation basically all you need is the alcohol to clean the area before you apply the vents to the area. I've  had these installed on my car for about two months now and I love them they held up very well.  They are perfect for when it rains,I'm now able to leave the windows cracked and not get the seats wet.  The plastic they are made of seams to be of good quality.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Like I said I love mine!
B002X1PNRY|2|Aftermarket spring on the lever is too strong rendering part unusable. Do not buy!
B00MUF4Q6M|5|great product at great price
B00CP8XXU4|5|Great product.  Quick shipping. Looks like factory installation.  My 16 year old and his friend installed these in an afternoon, taking their time to watch some videos and be patient with all the plastic parts on the truck.  These look really good on the truck. Highly recommend.
B00918ESUA|4|Easily installed on my Yamaha V-star 950. Comfortable and looks great for the price.
B002S4EVR4|3|Overpriced.  But every vehicle should have a basic first aid kit.  You are paying for the Mazda logo - just as I did.  A better kit can be found for cheaper.  It is nice that the back has Velcro attachment straps ... although the kit does not come with the necessary Velcro attachment tape.
B00IKSRTBM|5|Perfect fit, worked fine, much brighter.
B001FCRX0W|5|We make a mistake and bought a 2015 Sedona and needed to brighten up the rear blinkers on account of the pitiful rear lighting this vehicle has.<br />I installed the &#34;Plasma LED&#34; bulbs on the blinkers which brightened them up but it caused &#34;hyper flash&#34; which is common when installing low resistance bulbs.<br />Therefore I needed to install the load resistors to eliminate the &#34;hyper flash&#34; and they did.
B00B2YHFO2|5|THESE LIGHTS ARE OUTSTANDING.
B007PIZ8SY|5|So far great ! With regular antenna at about 70 mph a loud hum was aggregating to hear! So far ok with good reception!
B00E9GVXI4|4|Easy installation. Seems to be made well but only time will tell.
B00TYZKVU6|5|Perfect fit. A little pricey but what do you expect for a Lexus?
B0086QCARQ|5|Perfect size.
B00II55HAC|5|the leds made a huge difference and they are directional  which helps
B000W0RQ8C|5|Looks and performs well
B00V92U9RW|5|Fuel delivery is drastically important when you are building past the original limitations of your vehicle. I am impressed with the abilities of this pump. I tested it out immediately; this pump handles standard factory pressure and intence race pressures with easy, and is constant throughout your power band. I recommend upgrading your entire system prior to use, but I would buy this pump again and again
B00LML7GJY|5|My husband and I are avid hikers and we always carry multiple external battery chargers just in case. But it's usually a pain having to carry extra baggage and having to stop just to grab it out of our bags. This small and convenient piece of equipment is an absolute must now when we go out to the mountains. It hooks on to our bags so we always know where to grab for it, there's no fear of it running out of juice because of its solar charge capability and it helps lighten the load for our hikes! We've gone out twice with this little guy and haven't had any issues so far! Whether your a camper, hiker or just always on the go, this back up solar battery charger should be with you at all times.
B0040MI9H0|4|Works great
B00LX0C8XS|4|bag is huge, I was also able to put my tie down straps and a tow strap in the bag.<br /><br />For some reason, there was a package of cloth/rubber gloves in with the cables. I left them in the bag, just in case.
B00Z7KIZPA|1|this product promised high and delivered low.  my average sized purse didn't fit in the pouch.  even if i tipped it on it's side, getting it in the pouch was more trouble than it was worth since the netting didn't stay open without using two hands. quite awkward to do if you're sitting in the driver's side.  the product also had a funny smell until i aired it out.  i sent it back thanks to amazon's great return policy.
B000CAXHHG|1|shipped wrong part . THIS DOESN'T FIT 2001 KIA SPECTRA ( when it said it did )
B00JY94Y3C|3|While the color is nice  and they are pretty easy to attach to tires as soon as you go to the car wash they come off well atleast mines do. I only have three tires with the rimblade actually still attached and thats cause I put gorilla glue on those.
B003UM259Y|1|Does not even lift my car so now I'm out 80$ and it was a hassle to even pump bc the handle is so short
B00M9MULL0|4|Comfortable and cute!  Exactly what I needed.  I just wonder why the shipping takes so long.
B00596QVHG|5|Excellent Nozzles.
B009KHGUPS|5|These are so cut I love them. I have the matching car covers and plates.
B00076QA4C|5|Holds items in place, Easily removed when not needed.
B004I9MD2M|5|Works like a charm looks awesome
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Very good.
B002FSF2J4|5|fit my brothers 06 expedition just fine.  rides great. better than messing with airbags
B00AFBXQNC|5|the foam is superb, lifts the dirt up and helps keep the dirt from scratching the paint.
B00BTSHCXA|3|It works but it needs to use earbuds instead of speakers because half helmets make too much wind noise. Riding without a wind screen talking on the phone the person on the other end could hear me very well, I couldn't understand anything that person was saying. It does work better with a wind screen.
B007V2DTWQ|5|Fit perfect in our 08 Honda Accord.  Very happy with it.  Definitely keeps the car cooler.
B000FMM6NW|4|These work well if you need the grooves to hold round pieces but not so well if you are clamping smaller flat pieces
B004MDEV38|5|Installed on my 2015 Odyssey.  It was very easy to install.  Total installation took about 30 minutes.
B001FAGJJK|5|Purchased for a 2015 Willys Special Edition Jeep (Wrangler), Tank Green Color.  Looks great.  Easy to install.  Makes a huge difference in appearance.
B00WAORWGE|4|like ad said !
B008ZGEMBY|1|Box arrived with 4 of the 10 bulbs broken.  Bulbs are the wrong style.  198 bulbs have even height pins on the outer casing.  The bulbs have pins at different heights (like an 1197 bulb).  Total waste of money.
B00CZDQU3G|5|Great sticker. Great quality. Fast shipping.
B004C24HJ2|5|worked really well
B00FP0G5EK|5|Great product I haven't had any porblems since installed. I would definetely buy again.
B00GSAUHB8|5|We have a couple different shades, but this one is the best.  Covers the window more thoroughly and is easier to get folded up. Five stars and the vendor was great! Thank you!
B00H08JB9Q|4|A little thinner than I wanted, but it's a clean look.
B00C40R57K|3|It came on time with no problems and the front of it was very nice. The problem is the size.The race car wall thermometer was to be 30 inches high by 8 inches wide.The one I received was 16 inches by 5 inches.I am very disappointed.I am going to send it back.
B00AZ4SBRA|5|I have been wanting to purchase these for a while but was trying to figure out the right place to get them.  I tried these from Tuning Pros and I am glad I did!  It was a perfect fit for my Hyundai Tucson.  It came with very easy to read instructions and went on with no problems.  The only thing I will warn about is once you place these on your car, they are not moving.  The tape is by 3M and it is super sticky.
B00Q3UZURE|2|very cheaply made
B009OTW646|5|Pretty close to touchless for me. I only use this with a power washer as a treat for my car, mainly i use Optimum No Rinse as it is quicker and a lot more fun for me since i can wash more often. This is more foamy than CG Citrus Wash And Gloss. It smells great and it fun to use. I can't think that it would completely clean a really dirty car but I could be wrong. Overall, this is a great soap and I recommend getting it when there is a coupon with it.
B00D42AFS8|5|Couldn't believe it would start my truck with a 5.3l v8....it does great if the battery just needs a lil help.....I've started my truck at least 6 times without recharging before
B00BQN5OX8|5|Works great easy to install
B008TL6RT0|5|These things are great.  For the $10 or whatever I paid combined with Torque Pro I can see what my car and the engine computer are doing and reset fault codes and turn off the check engine light.  Used with Torque Pro it will also display all sorts of things in real time on your smart phone.
B006N9HQUO|5|So far so good. Will see for how long.
B009DK8JKQ|1|Took for ever to come in then they didn't fit smh. Return was very easy.
B0049HQJ8C|4|The size is perfect for my window and keeps my 2012 Odyssey EX van cool. My air conditioning cools so much faster when I use this sunshade. I give it 4 stars only because it is difficult to roll up. It's so large and the material doesn't roll tightly enough the first time or maybe I just need to become accustomed to rolling it up. The Velcro tie doesn't seem long enough either.
B000BUTDCA|5|What can I say, it works great and is definitely something that should be part of your travel gear.  The one time you pull into a campsite with all the 30 amp outlets taken and only 50 amp available, you'll be glad you did!
B007HSWQU0|5|looks sick on the back of my guitar.
B00029XC1I|5|Very nice, high quality sticker.
B001IX2J9I|5|As advertised.
B003XWG7F4|5|Love them on my VTX 1800. Helps my back!
B0064RML28|5|added style to the bike and look awesome
B0085YBJ9O|1|I have a 1996 dodge 3500 4x4 cummins 12V.  My truck has a 2&#34; leveling kit.  There is no way to adjust these as required in the Manufacture install guide.  Wish I just went with Moog.
B00BD62X9Q|5|Very easy to install.  I completed it in under 30 minutes, and I was taking my time.  However, I was replacing a burned out unit and was able to re-use the battery wire that was run for the last one.  Manufacturer website has a short video showing how to install it.  I would recommend watching it as it will save you some extra disassembly that's not necessary.
B00UVH8O00|5|LOOKS TUFF JUST GOT INSTALLED  EASY TO INSTALL WORKS GREAT LIGHTS LIKE DAY LIGHT
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great windshield cover! Works just fine with my 2012 mustang. Looked a little big but It fit just fine! Would recommend as a great alternative to the accordion style covers.
B00MIZT7OK|5|great little key chain with the potential to do some damage if you have to...great for college girls walking at night.  gives the feeling of security.
B00HS5O9DO|5|The braking rotors and pads are good fitted to my vehicle.
B000E3BX3Q|5|Good stuff
B004GDWJ4C|1|I have never felt so let down with a purchase from amazon! I received a damaged piece 3 times before I finally decided just to deal with it because I had to get my vehicle back on the road. Of course, I installed the damaged piece and not only was it broken it was not exactly an oeuvre piece. The headlights are held in place by a ball and socket type of connector. The holes in the new piece were not of the correct size to keep the headlights in their proper place. I already had a bit of time involved at this point and need the car for my commute, otherwise I would have returned it. Now I have to buy another one from the dealership to make it right. To hell with cheap Japanese parts!
B00U0AA5FU|3|Front fit perfectly! But the back did not! I have a 2015 Ram 1500 Crew Cab! I would not recommend doing business with this dealer. When I emailed about sizing, they gave me the run around!
B0027XATU4|1|Hinge sucked. Thin and looks cheap. I put it on my RV and it fit well. All but the hinge. I got it to stay with a screw on each side. Got on the highway and it blew right off. Damaged my screen and the frame. Truck behind me ran it over. Don't waste your time or money
B000COVH3S|5|Great quality, simple and it works.  This is my second one (two different vehicles) and they work great.
B00JA3BMDW|1|plus/minutes 3 degrees F
B000NDL3T6|5|This is the second one of these I own, this one has less rise.  They work fantastic!  Got so tired of the banging around from my car trailer just pulling it.  These cushioned balls stop 90% of that.  Excellent quality, made in America.
B000WER6WY|3|Installation was a breeze, taking less than a couple minutes per side including fit-procedure outlined in the instructions (ie, roll the window up and down a bunch of times.) The light gray tint makes a big difference for driver visibility - a Tacoma's front column is fairly chunky, and any further obstruction would otherwise blind a significant view of cross-traffic - but the tint is light enough you can see through it fairly easily, and still cuts down on the sun. The acrylic is a good thickness, and feels like it will survive more than a few good hits.<br /><br />Took off a star due to the exposed lower edge being essentially unfinished - the plastic is bubbled all along the edge (i assume a failed attempt at using heat to smooth it over, or poor casting), but then was finished off by a rough-grind, leaving a poor appearance, and more than a few sharp edges up near the mirrors. Both driver and passenger-side visors were finished in the same method. The second star is for cost, at almost twice the price of competitors, some form of quality control was expected otherwise its just another piece of plastic with a name-brand sticker.<br /><br />I didn't attempt a return, as the cost and hassle of returning isn't worth the time as i can finish the edge myself in only a few minutes. and since both left & right were finished the same, it seems likely a new set will be the same.
B006GJMMEG|5|These really worked well for leveling off the front of my jeep jk, Should have done it a long time ago.
B00M09MM4Q|5|Fits perfectly. Rocket Fast Delivery. Leave it in the sun to soften it up and it will help installation.
B00Y5ESM2A|1|Was not what was advertised
B000M5W25E|5|Still working well & good price.
B0007LVJ2A|4|c
B0007OWD2M|5|Amazing! So much better than windex and similar.
B0027AAJUC|5|the price was right, identical replacement, worked fine
B003TQ7T06|4|Factory fit.works fine.
B003D3TLV0|5|Great for the camper
B00LFL74FM|4|Fit great, however with very little force the back end came apart.  Put it back together and pressed the hub in and everything seems fine.
B008HZJRK4|5|Great quality.
B005MDS7QE|5|I received this to and it fits perfectly fine to the tailgate of my truck
B00GSAUHB8|5|I love this product.  It works just like they said it would.  I have had no problems at all folding it up & putting it in the case.  I wasn't able to touch my steering wheel because it was too hot from the sun.  This was the perfect solution.
B007QV5U7Y|5|I bought this and the 5302 for my work cart and I'm very pleased. The way that the wrenches fit into the slot is perfect; not too tight and not too loose. I've even received compliments on how nice they make my tool cart look and how organized everything is. I would definitely recommend this!
B0030CYLD2|5|Perfect fit for the wall!
B003VAWVNU|5|I use it for tent camping. If you camp with a group of tent campers, watch out. Everyone wants to borrow it. Very sturdy. It's survived sweeping heavy sand off beach decks and fine dirt in tents.
B00MG687JW|5|Only had it a week or so and a truck near me had started to prepare to jump his battery.  I asked if I could try out my new gizmo.  It was a 7 liter diesel ford F250. When hooking up i realized i'd left the unit on and was afraid it might have drained.  I hooked it up and the truck started immediately.  The other guys standing around were amazed and took pictures of the unit so they could get one themselves.  Cool product!
B001LHVOVK|5|One day I will try it.
B00ZG6JKUO|5|Im very happy with what i got. Yes, some lame girly stickers, a few slid off the backing and stuck to another sticker, but for what you get and what you pay, yiu get your moners worth. I liked it enough to the point i ordered 2 more.
B0018YIL4O|5|The complete kit for my 2006 F350. Online it seemed like you might need to order a bracket, but everything was included. It's Rancho, what else do I need to say, I like the product. Ordered another for my 2008 F350 but haven't got it on yet.
B0000AX5X5|5|These are perfect for dusty conditions. Unlike some of the other anti-fog goggles we've used these face the vents backwards so the dust, dirt, and other crap doesn't come straight into the goggles. They still won't fog because they do have the air flow, but it's just more intelligently designed to keep things out.
B0018EPFI4|5|Excellent
B00387A6TC|5|Great Product at the right price.
B000BW8LRQ|5|Work as expected
B000BRF3VS|5|I installed one in a  trailer last week, everything works perfectly.  When on the high speed it is still pretty quiet (I could sleep with it on high). When on high it creates a nice breeze in the trailer.
B00597E5WI|5|Great product, Item as described, A++!
B005FL28YU|5|These are amazing brakes, they were very easy to install, just as they the company claims. I have put about 1,500 miles on them thus far and I couldn't be happier with them. They truly are the power stop brakes you want, they are very quiet, they stay quite cool and are very smooth.<br /><br />I can honestly say, that I will be buying these brakes and these brakes only, anytime I or someone I know needs brakes.
B00080QHMM|5|Very good and accurate, reading is visible in direct sunlight.
B009LZUJRY|5|Easy to install and came with everything needed to get the job done. Works faster and smoother than the stock piece it replaced.
B007A3TCHW|4|Does this fit my trx300 2 wheel drive..?
B0045N2A3I|3|Quick delivery.  Great Product. It worth the prices.
B006EGAIII|5|I have a lowered Prius and do not currently have a garage, so the ramps make it easy to slide underneath my car and work on it over grass or even in the parking lot at university. Great product.
B00IBMPF5Y|5|What a difference!! Very strong. Easy to install.
B00JIACMF4|5|Easy install good quality Wish I had purchased this years ago
B00E0IK3LY|4|This was a gift but per my son, fit perfectly!
B00C1K0LBU|5|I've purchased Mercedes Benz filters and Mann oil filters. To my eye they are identical except for one feature; the Mercedes Benz logo is missing on the Mann oil filter.
B004P5G2GM|5|These things are pretty handy, especially when traveling.  You know - I have my cell phone, she has hers, she has her kindle, I have my drink, she has hers, etc.  Bought two - one foe each car.
B00IJ0X5IC|5|Classy, brassy ornament. Looks good on my black Equinox. I've never seen such an exquisite Masonic emblem as this one for a vehicle ornament.
B0044Q7N24|5|Works great
B000WNWFP8|5|great fit. works great
B0091II8X8|5|I had stain overspray all over a brand new car's paint job (car was 1 week old!).  I first used the Meguiar's clay bar, which was getting rid of the stain, but at a painfully slow pace.  Not wanting to use an aggressive clay, I tried this fine grade prep towel after reading some reviews.  All I can say is WOW!  It removes the stain almost effortlessly, and the stain had been baking onto the paint in 90F weather for several days!<br /><br />It's kind of hard to tell when the towel is dirty enough to rinse by looking at it (versus a lighter colored clay), but you can tell it's dirty when it starts sticking to the car's surface at the end of each stroke and leaves little gray marks (that wipe off with a towel).  At that point, rinse with warm water (no soap) and it will dry quickly, ready to be used again.<br /><br />I saw a neat idea in a YouTube video where the guy used a magic marker to write a number, 1 through 4, on the back side of each of the four corners.  He then folds the towel into fourths.  When it starts getting dirty, he uses another fourth of the towel.  The numbers help you keep track of which fourth of the towel you already used.  When you've used all four fourths of the towel, rinse it out and use it again.  I've heard it can be used up to 100X, so well worth the money.  Saves your back and arm muscles also!
B0051TPJKG|5|A coworker had a house fire and it spurred me to purchase this. A few weeks later I had a tiny grease fire on my stove. I grabbed one of these and sprayed it right out. It didn't make a huge mess either. I'm really happy with the purchase.
B00PJ35W1K|5|Nice graphic.
B00JV61WCO|5|They were even better than I expected. Received so many compliments. The price was perfect as well.
B00RIBY2T4|5|Love it!
B004EAMMLW|1|Doesn't work as advertised.
B000JEENCS|4|Only dead fish go with the flow. This is a motto I support. It is good to relax and be accepting when you can. But it's also important to stand your ground about the people and things that you love. This sticker washed off in the rain after about 2 years. But I bought another one because I like it.
B0006IX7W4|4|perfect just had to bend the s-hooks so they would stay on the hangers
B005I5JGGQ|5|great under-the-hood dress up
B00P2W2KHM|5|I sólo happy with My productos and good quality .the Best price that any body thx
B007K299K8|5|love them. looks great with my LED bulbs
B00CVFIJ4G|5|Love!!!  It fit perfect for my CLA 250💗💗💗💗
B007J7E2O2|5|Good quality. Made of durable material Go cowboys
B0053TU3OQ|4|Just what I wanted!
B0027ZGJCE|1|most stupid sticker I've seen.... calling on amazon, pull this out!!!
B000C544X2|5|These improved the ride of my truck by leaps and bounds. Moog has high build quality and these Ball Joints are no different. I have a pair on the truck now that have well over 60k miles on them and still operate fine. These were to replace cheap aftermarkets that were put on before I bought my truck. Getting them off and putting the new ones on is obviously not an easy task but there is nothing that Moog can do to change that. These were for a 2008 F250 application.
B00N5MVB5I|5|I have 2013 Genesis sedan with 17th wheels.  These caps fit perfectly and look much nicer than the stock silver caps with the drunken H symbol.  The black background provides some needed contrast as opposed to the silver caps on silver wheels.  I used a hooked pick to remove the original caps without having to remove the rims.
B000CII6XS|5|Read and heed the review by Happy TEN.  Everything they said about what NOT to do is EXACTLY TRUE.  Do NOT doubt us!!!  Skip our advice at your own peril!  Great for tires, not for wheel covers, paint, driveways etc.
B00GXRJRQC|5|Love them.  Definitely enhanced the look of my malibu
B00HS1HOFI|5|Works great
B005MZXUFK|5|Nice to have on my credenza at work.
B00KTHXYO8|5|This replacement shell FOB case is perfect! The outer finish isn't as shiny and smooth as the factory Toyota FOB key but it certainly does the job. Transferring the inner components of key to the brand new case was simple and straight forward. Literally took only 30 seconds to complete for those who are in speculation of messing anything up. The package also came in a day early so that's a plus.
B00F9EDMIO|5|Fit perfectly into my 2002 883R. The engine cranks over faster with this higher CCA battery. I accidentally left the key on from Friday evening until Monday morning when I noticed it. Even though the gauge lights were on the entire weekend, it started the engine with no notice of a low battery.
B008VONUXG|5|Who doesn't like butterflies?  It's pretty and cheerful.
B004BGN0L0|5|My wife's black car hadn't been washed for months. I bought this spray and three microfiber towels. I wiped top to bottom and cleaned the windows last.<br /><br />The car looks professionally washed. And it took less that 15 mins.<br /><br />Use soft, absorbent towels and follow the simple directions.<br /><br />(A very dirty Prius took about 1/5 of the bottle.)<br /><br />I'm going to buy a gallon!
B00M9PDYJ8|5|great as a back-up light
B000VKYCNU|4|Pros:  Muffler fits 2001 Chrysler Voyager 3.3 flex. After cutting off old muffler pipe from cat fits into muffler enough to use a clamp. Resonator side the overlap was not enough to be able to use a clamp had to weld. Not much of an issue.  Cons:  Bought this model because it came with a hanger assy. attached.  The muffler hanger Does Not line up with the vans holders, paid extra for a hanger that was not use-able out of the box.  Had to manipulate hangers to somewhat fit.<br />Recommend: buy the cheaper muffler (almost half the price) and fabricate hangers.
B00COORDSW|2|pros:<br />fit nicely and installed within an hour.<br />everything turns on and works as it should<br />lights are awesome and can see well with them<br />whole kit included so you dont need any extra parts to install them<br /><br />cons:<br />came with orange lights for hi beams. when i bought it, i thought i would get the blue high and lo beams. i apparently was wrong.<br />when the blue lo lights come on they take 5 seconds to actually light up, not sure if thats supposed to happen or not.<br /><br />overall:<br />these are good lights and have worked for the past month for me. i really dislike that they arent both blue lights, i was lead to believe they would be. otherwise its a good product and will update if anything changes.
B00I535Z3Q|5|Product was delivered on time and was what I expected.
B006X6O5O2|5|Very good easy to install looks great, rite  price wife did a good job installing
B00J57BLLG|5|I love this holder!
B00F2NHVX4|5|Works great and fits my car wash bucket perfectly.
B002CNAEHM|5|Nice looking with a super low price. No need to get wheel covers from a dealer and pay $$$$.
B0002KKTWC|5|Best 2 stroke oil on the market
B000GUYJYC|5|these bars look great and are a perfect fit for my 2001 Vulcan took me about 15 minutes to put on
B00P1NXYL8|2|I bought this cable (green banded, the right one for my 2015 Golf GTI Mk 7) so my iPhone 6 would have the highest level of compatibility with my new car, but relative to connecting my iPhone 6 via Bluetooth it seems as though I've bought a very expensive charging cable.I should preface this comparison by noting that my phone was linked to my car via Bluetooth when I first got it,  before I bought the cable and tried using it, including uploading all of my Contacts into the GTI's system, and that all of the music in my phone is from CD's ripped ALAC into my Mac Mini, and album art is present in my phone; no downloads or MP3's in my phones music, and that all of the tests of the cable were done with the Bluetooth in my phone switched off, and all tests of the Bluetooth connection were with the cable unplugged from my phone.<br /><br /> That said, comparing my phones compatibility with my car via Bluetooth vs.via this cable, here's what I came up with.<br />1. Album art? Via cable, none.  Via Bluetooth, none.<br />2. GPS from iPhone map app?  does not appear on GTI's display via cable, does not appear via Bluetooth.<br />3. Steering wheel controls? Via cable, they work.  Via  Bluetooth, they work.<br />4. Charging phone? Via cable, yes. Via Bluetooth, NA.<br />5. Playing music from my phone? Via cable, works fine. Via Bluetooth, works fine.<br />6. Access Contacts? Via cable, can't see Contacts. GTI display does not recognize any Phone functions via cable. Via Bluetooth, can see all Contacts etc.<br />7. Pandora? Via cable, music plays but steering wheel controls do not work. Via Bluetooth, music plays and steering wheel controls do work.<br /><br />Any suggestions from more savvy iPhone 6 users here as to how I can get cover art that is in my phone to appear on the GTI's display via the cable, and/or the iPhone map app?  Could it be that because my phone was paired via Bluetooth with the GTI's system, my contacts uploaded etc,  before I got and tried the cable that the GTI's system does not want to allow &#34;equal access&#34; to my phone via this cable? I would appreciate any input on this.  As it stands I'm glad I saved the box for this cable, because for $60.00 some dollars I see it going back to Amazon and me using the free car charger that I got when I bought my iPhone 6 at Costco.<br /><br />Thanks

B008PQU0ZG|4|This will work for 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Although the dealership will have to re-flash computer to turn on tow wiring.  This issue exists regardless of plug style/brand.  The self-tapping screws don't work if you have a mounting bracket on hitch; you'll need to buy nuts and bolts.
B00QYEUSSA|4|This grill looks and works great once installed. But it's not a perfect fit, so installation can be a bear. I knew that before ordering so it was worth the time to install. You won't find a cheaper stainless grill!
B000CGG1HS|5|Perfect part!
B000GPV2QA|2|I just got my Wagan 400 Power Dome.  My initial reaction is disappointment.  The manual says to charge the unit for 36 hours before initial use.  I don't see how to charge it.  This is no AC adapter.  This is a DC adapter.  Am I supposed to connect this to my car for 36 hours?  I bought the device to jump start my car battery when needed, not to deplete the battery.
B00FDQPCR2|1|WORKED FOR ONE DAY!
B007V8NMWM|5|added style to the bike and look awesome
B00HG2UEBA|4|I bought this because I was installing a hitch on my Dodge Nitro. When I first opened the box and held the step, I honestly believed I was sold a cheap piece of plastic. After actually using it though, I found it to be more sturdy than I originally thought. Overall I believe this to be a good purchase. I only wish it was cheaper.
B00FZLB86Y|5|Hi the step come incomplete
B00TE86U9Y|5|It fits perfectly in the 2015 Honda Fit. Already saved my trunk from beef blood.
B001JT1CEE|2|I was looking for 20 AWG stranded wire. Id imagine most people buying 20g are doing so precisely because its not the far more common 22g, nor the also far more common 18awg. So, again, people who are buying 20g WANT 20g and probably they have some decent, specific reason. In my application the weight and resistance differences (vs 22awg) were non negligible. So I was dissapointed when i noticed its exactly the same gauge as my clearly marked hitachi 22awg wire which i have a ton of. To be sure I took some measurement and the math put this spot on at 22awg since a 100mm length which, when carefully stripped, weighed out to 0.26g-- the same length of 20AWG conductor shoud weigh 0.46g.<br /><br />Im not sure whether Im able to return it since its open and &#34;damaged&#34; now

B00PPVCJ80|1|Does not fit the GSXR 600. Cheap quality clips, don't waste your money
B005QIC9VO|1|My husband was riding at night and the sunscreen falls foward. It won't go back up and had to be removed. He only wore it once. A poor quality product. I do not recommend it.
B00MWH72IW|1|It's a misleading advertisement from the RockyMRanger seller.  This product is Waterproof car cover as advertisement.  It's a thin cover and small.  The XL  doesn't fit my sedan.  The seller refuses to accept my return.
B00LNK43FY|5|It is exactly what I wanted,, looks great on my new car.

B00CC8OBY4|5|This sticker is awesome!
B000J15THO|5|The best fluid around. I change it every 5 years and it is still purple in color and I could probably go another 2 years. Never had a problem with any royal purple fluids
B007CPLFM8|5|Great product, met all my expectations plus a perfect fit.
B000KEZDUI|4|Easy to install and very useful.
B00G1Y4PWS|1|Used it on my gsxr k8 and the front break locked<br />Thank god I wasn't speeding or I would die from the break lock<br />Scary as hell<br />Make sure it fits properly please

B007RFDE4U|5|tese work great and help with brightening the interior of the vehicle
B000IDUW5C|5|It's small and light, you get two in the box. The blade is sharp and I'm sure it would cut through a seat belt. I tried the escape tool, pressing it against a piece of wood and it &#34;fired&#34; as advertised (it's a spring loaded pin that looks a bit like the point of a nail). It drove the pin about 0.25 inches into the wood. I thought it would go in farther, but on reflection it doesn't have to penetrate the glass very far to break it. The directions also tell you to active it in one of the corners of the window, obviously taking out any flexibility the glass might have. I have read that firemen used to use a screw driver to break car windows (hold down the handle with one hand firmly holding the handle on the window glass -- with the tip of the screwdriver at one of the window corners - then grab the tip and pull outward, letting it SNAP back down against the glass). I figure if that works for the fire department, this should work for me. I hope to never have to use it, I feel a bit safer now that I have one handy.

B004GEWP7C|5|Great price and great product had bulbs and new sockets!!
B000H6P55W|2|Bought for a vacation with 6 people. While the bag did fit quite a bit of things into it, the zipper ripped on our way home, and we drove 6 hours with all of our contents in our kids laps instead of in the bag. I'm sure there are better products out there.
B00XOTJ5DM|5|Works great on invisible bra on car
B00TTKICNY|5|i love it. Installed it on my 2012 Nissan altima with a 1000rms sound system all pro speakers. what i have noticed my voltage stays above 13 volts and my bass sounds deeper and mids more crisp. I didn't expect all these changes but a big batttery like this is worth every penny. thanks.
B00GT2FUB2|5|Great Product, have used it numerous times.  going to lake today and fully expect to use it on the boat.
B00GVV2PMI|5|Had a little mix up with the product. Mad supply fixed the issue quickly and I will do some more ordering from them soon. The product is top notch made my trucks paint touch up a snap.
B00068OL1A|4|This is a very good product for maintaing the originl shine on the car paint. My car thogh 3 yeard old but looks brand new!
B006Q7C7L6|5|Works for my boat just as product description
B007V2C59E|5|bought for my 2015 BMW 5  series.  Love it! Best one I have ever owned.  Definitely would buy again
B00BGZ4QCG|5|shipped as promised, came in perfect condition.  will order again in the future if any other of my cars needs.
B00D3298A0|4|Good price, a little small, but fit.
B009DJK4LE|5|Made like the one it replaced.
B001DCECYE|5|Perfect fit on my 2006 Nissan Xterra. Oil pressure gauge was pinned at high. Once replaced with this part the gauge read correctly.
B0099RKG1S|5|Worked great on my 2013 Avalanche. I have huge tires and a lift. The valve stem and sensor are in the middle of the tire. The only way it would work was to put it on the stem. Sidewall and center of the tire were to far away. It read the sensors then programmed just fine. Dealership tried on the sidewall and said I need new sensors. They were wrong! This worked great for me.
B00ERXG4TM|5|We recently adopted a 2014 Ural Gear-Up & wanted to ride far & long. We tried the Cramp Buster, but after our first 4 hour ride to Santa Barbara, I couldn't make a fist for over a week.  Something had to change.  I pulled off those Cramp Busters, slapped this on & have been sooooo much happier!  I also have Grip Puppies to help minimize vibration, so I cut a little of the end so the Go Cruise would clamp directly on the grip.  We skipped using the rubber band type part they provided & it seems to work fine with our standard 5/8&#34; handlebars.  If its too loose, tighten it up a smidge.  Too tight?  Loosen 'er up!
B001CZODH8|5|Really good product. Worked very well in my case on town and country 2008 with over 10k on it. Reduced gas consumption and added extra power!
B004SS8CFU|4|I've had several car covers on various cars.  I shopped around for several months before buying this for a Cadillac CTS Sportwagon, where my biggest concern is sun damage.  This cover works great!  It's less expensive than others, but meets my needs better.  In bright 90+ degree Florida sun, interior of car is still cool and protected.  It reflects radian sunlight very well.  The rear loop strap is great for single-handed installation.  Only change I made was to add labels to show inside and outside, because I installed it inside out once and, when it rained, the mistake was evident.  Without the label, it's hard to tell inside from outside, particularly if you're distracted, in low light, or in a hurry.
B00GBSDVDS|5|Perfect size for the most commonly used tools I carry doing telecom field work.
B000VLF9NQ|5|Great cover
B002GTOE7S|5|My order got to me on time and the bar ends were very easy to install after a quick you tube video

B00938VOOG|5|Great product. Great price. Arrived early.
B00GI77OVW|3|received this item couple days ago august 13. changed my gf map light and it looks way brighter than her stock bulbs. so much clearer in the car driving around at night. 1 of the bulb is now flickering and dimming but will try and fix that and will see how it goes
B001552RKU|4|I really like this frame but be warned it does cover the corners of your liscence plate and some info so you might get pulleddover depending how strict the state you live in. I live in ma and have yet to be pulled over though.
B00VWMKV1I|3|These were cute, but much thinner than similar products and peeled a lot faster.Maybe a thicker top coat would help them last longer.
B00A8MZ910|4|as advertised and expected
B00AV8HKCM|2|I must admit that i was attracted to this stand based on price and several positive reviews. Upon receiving the stand and then assembling it i began to immediately have my concerns about its quality. This stand is to be used for a KTM 125 which is a fairly light bike compared to others that were described in some of the reviews. After lifting my bike for the first time, i noticed that it was leaning pretty significantly off to the side opposite the lift handle and the reason for this is that there is no support of this post once the lift is fully extended. Any bike heavier than mine will surely make this effect worse and may actually compromise the safety of you and you bike in my opinion. The simple fix would have been to incorporate a simple lock out device to keep the post from retracting. Also, you better hope that you don't accidentally kick the the lift handle in a way the would disengage it as there is no locking device to keep that from happening. I paid an outrageous price to have this thing shipped to me and feel like a fool for having done it.
B00KA49H2I|1|Does not fit my Kia soul 2015 keg like it says
B00EPFYZRU|1|this item is not what I expected. the leather is old. the silver sides are cracked. it seems as you send me a used item. very unhappy. it will cost me more time and money to send it back. I am trashing this key chain.
B00DBEM7HG|5|Arrived early, great quality and bright. Am using as a spotlight for reading lights in a small RV. The more LEDs the brighter the bulb, and these replaced some with 9 LEDs which were too dim.
B0017J7NQ2|5|Easy to put together and mount up.  I had it up in less than 10 minutes after arrival.
B00P2SJNBM|5|After searching in Canada, the Kia dealer wanted 3-times the cost to replace my trunk lifts on my Kia Spectra5!  I had these installed, and they fit perfectly!  Great!
B0009IQZFM|5|Wow.  This thing works!  Be sure to always air dry when washing!
B00BV6EY2C|3|We purchased this one for a 99 4wd Durango. It works.<br /><br />However, I'm wondering if we should have spent the additional $$ for the Dorman brand. Even before installing I noticed that the universal joints on this shaft were much harder to turn on one plane compared to the other. After install, the steering was really, really tight---much tighter than when the Durango was new. It has become easier, but even after about 250 miles on twisty roads it is still takes an abnormal effort to turn the steering wheel while driving.
B00PWLTWH4|4|Well worth the money
B00371V364|5|we like both pairs we bought, thanks
B00RAZXKJ6|5|Received on time. Good quality
B001NYLKJC|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.. rough instalation.
B0031H4PRI|4|Great bargain
B001FE35GG|5|Perfect fit at half the cost of the dealership. Must use special driver to install, don't try drifting this on.
B000C9FQ30|3|This GM OE rear rotor does not fit a 2003 GMC  Yukon XL as it states it does. Be sure to check it as soon as it comes in so you don't miss the return window like I did. By the time my husband had time to put it in it was past return date of 30 days. Luckily my old ones were still good. I should've checked with him before I ordered. Our rotors needed to be 6 bolt not 8 like these. But they did come in a timely manner and the box a little damaged. It's heavy so what do you expect.
B00WYI9SUO|4|Great for the price. Order one size bigger then what you need and its perfect
B00BGRDN6O|5|i put these on my 07 Fj Cruiser and yea baby!better ride quality and looks great<br />figured these would make a good substitute  until i save up for the rims i want.<br />These are a must have for any enthusiast!!!
B0002CADS0|2|Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me a way to post a comment without reviewing the product and giving stars.  I ordered this for my 2005 Maxum 1800MX which has the 3.0L Mercruiser engine.  The description makes it sound like it would work for my alternator, but after getting the part, removing the alternator, and disassembling - it does not fit at all.  If your alternator looks like this one - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027Z0CTK - then this is NOT the voltage regulator for you.  Save yourself the time and headache.  This may work for other Mercury engines / alternators, but it certainly doesn't work for all of them as the description implies.<br /><br />The product itself may work great, but based on the description issues and the fact that it doesn't work with my alternator, I can't say.  Now you know and can avoid making the same mistake I did.
B002NUABUO|5|works best for me...tried others....
B007MHC7ZK|4|Only be on for a few weeks, looked better when first applied
B00LJ3BLQY|1|Tried to like microfiber pads, never had any positive result. Went to Rupes UHS foam pads and UHS compound, perfect results under direct light.<br /><br />Like any other foam or microfiber pad, these would eventually get hot no matter how little or much I used, or regardless of speed or how slow I was movingg, however, the UHS pads barely got warm and even had longer work times.

B007WEQP6U|4|Worked good for tethering my firearm case to my luggage
B004SPE1QW|1|I followed the directions in cleaning this shammy before actually using it. To no avail it left lint pieces all over my car no matter how I rinsed, washed it, or dried it. I ended up sending it back and got one at the local big box store that was cheaper and doesn't leave a mess on my car.
B00B8SUJRC|5|Excellent product and timely service...
B0007ZL174|5|got the job done
B0051PJWQW|5|Three step process:  3M 39017 Plastic Cleaner, 3M 39010 Polish and Protector, then this product.  Worked well to restore shine and clarity to mildly hazed 14 year old plastic headlamp lenses.  Very pleased with results.
B00XRWDFOQ|5|NO fading so far and I live in the South where there is blistering sun almost every day.
B005NLQAHS|1|It initially worked for 2 days. Then it wouldn't communicate with torque any longer. It is connected to my phone (note 3), but doesn't connect to torque. Tried everything from un/reinstalling the app to reconnecting it to phone and turning off all bluetooth apps/devices. Nothing works. Returning.
B00W5MG8XY|4|Well made tire pressure gauge.  Nice rubberized grip.  Seems accurate and easy to use with one caveat.  I use it on a motorcycle with spoked wheels.  Because of angle of the part that actually attaches to the valve stem, it's hard to get the right angle because of the spokes you have to work around.  A straight rather than angled end piece would make this device easier to use.
B00LX0C8XS|5|Nice cables for the price. Included gloves which I used the first time I had to jump my car. Didn't have to get dirty before work. Also has a bag to put cables in.
B003GDBN9A|5|As advertised
B0001MQ7FO|2|I could be wrong but this may be only used for Kooltron products.  I used it for another portable refrigerator and drained my battery.
B0092ZO3AW|5|Everything went well
B00HTV2GSM|1|This product is junk.  Valve leaked (through valve body, not at threads) within first couple of days. Finally figured it out when I noticed 10-15 fresh oil spots on my year-old asphalt driveway. Crawled under the vehicle with a clean rag, and sure enough it was leaking through the valve.
B00GVHFCMW|5|It's a wonder handy tool to be in your car.<br />Whether it is to check the tires pressure at any time of the day during day or night.<br />Or whether you want to use a flash light for looking around your car in the dark and the multiple knife tool kit for all purposes. It is wonderful to have.<br /><br />Apart from these, the tools for emergency situations use are always awesome and safe to have just in time.<br /><br />Thank you team for the wonderful product.
B004W97G8O|5|Love it! Car looks 10x Better!
B000MD4YKM|1|Junk. Shipped with a defective internal plunger seal (the plunger can travel all the way to the top of a full cylinder without developing any pressure) and a broken plunger lock, making cartridge loading nearly impossible.
B00CFJTVKO|4|The Transmission linkage that I received, was supposed to fit a 2000 Nissan Frontier, however the first link section had to be used from the old transmission linkage in order to fit the motor shaft configuration, and the ball joint connections we're not identical in size. Though the ball joint has seated enough to hold the connection together my concern is, how long will it remain??
B00PGH5SLS|5|This thing is great. Got it for 2015 Mazda CX-5 key/remote. remote fit right in. Pin for clasp is screw not snap, so it will stay attached. Ring for extra keys and stuff for key chain. Operates locks and car without removing from pocket. Great protection for expensive remote without being too cumbersome.
B00GRS2Y0I|5|Super product, does the job well and is super compact.
B001RAQGXC|4|It really works but you have to keep on trying it.
B006PHM1OU|5|good product and good price

B00AGJT07Y|5|Great quality decal for a great company!
B009ABZ44C|5|The clear bi-focal area on these makes them perfect for driving glasses. You can see the speedometer and gauges or anything else in the car while benefiting from clear, polarized, sunglasses. I go out of my way to find these.
B0055B121U|5|Thanks
B000VAY3R0|1|lite and will not last
B000UHDVS6|3|Holds the funnels well but could use a hole in the bottom that allows to put a Drain bottle on the bottom for the funnel. plus it is a bit small to where most funnels will not fit.
B00PA2LMVY|2|I usually love Griot's Garage and have been buying many of their products for years now.  However, after receiving this car wash and using it just this weekend I have noticed that it leaves the worst soap spots on black cars (for which I own 2).  I did not leave the cars in the sun to wash them, rinsed throughly, and detailed each section at a time.  Regardless I do not recommend this car wash for black cars...  The irony is that I used Griot's Garage Speed Shine (a fantastic product btw) to help rid the spots off the car.  If Amazon will take it back, I will be returning this car wash for sure.
B000C9F60I|4|this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements

B003YMX0WG|5|Installed myself while I was changing my brake pads.  Fit on perfectly and after months of use, no issues.  No noises etc...
B00GBVHPNW|4|Awesome!
B001BK4A7W|4|Perfect fit easy to install just like OME
B007PT0QH6|5|They work very well. For Gtr! E85 pump upgrade but limited on 600whp
B000GU0MMU|5|This saved me from crawling underneath car, removing all those torx screws holding on the underbody shield and draining it the typical manner.  Be patient; this does require periodic pumps to keep the flow moving and it does take a long time, perhaps 45 mins to one hour.  Pay attention as you add oil back because it's easy to overfill as I don't think this removes quite all the oil, unless you take great precautions to keep the car completely level during extraction.
B00Q38K5KS|5|Great product for a great price!
B00IOLSPSQ|5|They arrived very quickly, exactly what I ordered (set of 2 indicators). There were no instructions but they were individually packaged and very clean. As a previous reviewer said, they are significantly dimmer than the original lights but still great. Note, to change these out, you need a flathead screwdriver and a T10 screw bit and you have to remove all parts of the mirror to access the indicator. Should take no more than 15-20 minutes per side mirror.
B0006305WO|2|they're not heavy duty strong steel as they look like & the package is almost smaller than CD package
B00LO20AIK|5|Worked perfectly........
B006XBSJHG|3|The glove are of good quality and I like the style. However, although both gloves are labeled large, they are of different sizes. The right hand fit tightly and the left was a little larger. I preferred the larger fit of the left hand glove. There appears to be a discrepancy in the manufacture of the right and left glove. To convince myself that I did not have a difference in size of my hands, I tried the left glove on my right hand. I considered returning but figured that a replacement pair would be the same. I decided that I could accept the difference in fit of each glove.
B0097SDUTE|5|I can see this product working well. I see difference in my car performance.
B003V57NUQ|3|Great price but hard to initially assemble. Once you get the screw holes lined up (which was tricky) it is challenging to tighten the bolts without the screw turning too. It took us way longer to get the initial assembly completed that we ran out of time to actually try and put them on the car and take the kayak out for a paddle...  So not sure how the overalls function of the kayak holder will work out, hoping it is smoother than the assembly.
B004YHOB5U|5|Love the kit gets my car nice and clean quick
B000COO3PM|4|Work as expected...
B0016KH24U|5|Use for my Coleman 12v cooler in bed of truck. Works awesome.

B00KMR3F8U|5|I have a Ford E250 and chrome bumper.  Installed an aluminum 3/4&#34;x3/4&#34; L bracket to the bottom of the chrome bumper.  .  Just cut the L bracket about 61&#34; or so and the pre drill lL bracket.  Then use 3/4&#34; self tappers and impact drive them into the bottom starting from the middle 2 and then use quick grip clamp to bend to the curvature of the bumper and self tap them up. Screw in about a 1/2&#34; back from the rounded area I used 6 self tapping screws.Then mounted the light bar to this, which stuck on perfectly.The result is impressive because the chrome mirrors each LED and you get twice the amount of light.  Also everything is out of the way as well. I will add photos if I can later.  A+
B00H8PGHP2|5|Works well, high quality
B003IDOH5K|3|Shipping was fast but had fine stratches on all over and it was black..  Instead of returning it i was able to polish some of the scratches out but not all.. 3 stars for poor quality control..
B006R0IY8M|5|take care lining it up, and go slow - but it was pretty easy to get on, and I got it pretty straight - and it looks really, really cool.
B002QGVW3K|5|My Enfield trial uses this battery.
B00E9ANSGU|4|Hubby is happy so I am happy. Other than that they are jumper cables. The coating on the cables is very soft and flexible. Waiting to see what they will be like when it is 20 below zero.

B002P8R97C|5|Super fast delivery.  Perfect fit for my 2002 Chrysler Sebring 2door.
B00SKGHL6W|5|easy to install, exactly as shown
B00C53LX60|4|Love it
B00ZR51DSG|1|I'm just assuming these were not authentic. 3 out of 5 didn't work. Tried on 2 mods just to make sure. Pretty frustrating considering the price and week I waited. Thanks so much. Won't have to worry about me buying again.
B00N39AHEE|5|worked as advertised ,arrived sooner than expected.
B00AAGDEB6|4|Works great for cleaning our motorcycles.
B00BITI7KM|4|great price fit just fine
B0052FLY44|3|It's a strut bar. It does what it's suppose to. The struts are so close to the firewall, I'm not sure how much improvement it really makes. I think it is a bit pricey but, it's TRD so that's to be expected. It has a nice powder coat finish. Comes with the hardware to install, as well as the installation instructions. It's pretty straight forward.
B000CN9KQA|5|Wanted EGR for my Tacoma, amazon kept stating this model would not fit my truck. Make sure to double check with EGR website. Awesome fit, easy to install took about 3 minutes. We ordered these for 3 vehicles.
B0038YNA16|4|c
B000IEZEHM|5|fit perfectly easy install
B0009X8LTK|5|The color is what I was looking for and it drys quickly.
B000HBNVH6|5|Worked great and fast delivery.
B007QPFUCU|5|Fit the windshield just fine.
B009XOTRBM|5|Works well.  Attached to my RV bumper in minutes.
B000EQDYDA|4|The kit was as described.
B0009H51MG|1|I'm sure the product is fine, however, it doesn't fit a 2003 Subaru Forester...
B002R0SC9W|5|good
B00ANZHG4U|5|Just used a few, and so far, so good. Great price for a lot of cloths. 48 count for $22.99 My old cleaning rags are torn and tattered,  and these will make a better than good replacement for them. I recommend them.
B00594B1KA|5|Just what I needed
B006O74SSI|4|These pads work fine, but they do squeak sometimes.
B0089RSXOG|5|Wonderful service and part worked great.
B00JWTRMD8|5|Buddy of mine just bought a used motorcycle. Well used motorcycle. I got him the  protection bell for it. To keep the road gremlin  off his engine. That bike needs all the help it can get.
B000ONZT5Y|5|I cut this to use in my server intakes to keep the dust out (without oiling them of course).
B00GJX1NYE|5|This cable made installing my brake controller quick and easy.
B000GU25Y8|5|well made
B005GMALDS|3|wheel is okay .adapter dose not fit right.was told by some Einstien ,&#34;that they couldn't make an adapter for every model on the road&#34; but, when i requested one they gave me a part # that was ,&#34;supposed to work&#34;.it did not!that's when he told me the afore mentioned remark.also treated me as if i should of known.a real wise ass.i wish i could have been a little closer to him,like in arms reach!
B00J2CI4LY|3|don't expect them to be very bright. mostly cosmetic to have them. i didn't expect much but would have loved to be impressed by the product. but they are cheap as well
B0014B860A|5|The it was perfect and the stopping force is great.
B00BJMZ3VO|5|An  amazing purchase! I required (or desired) a second key remote for my 2010 Hyundai. The parts department at my Hyundai dealership wanted $189.00 just for the part. I found the exact remote (new) on Amazon for $29.99. What more can I say, other than I did have it programmed (for a fee) at the dealership and it works.
B000C913U0|5|Easy to install brake pads that fit properly and stop great
B00YBQWIZO|3|its ok
B0000AXQU2|4|COMES WITH ALL YOU NEED EXCEPT ANTI-FREEZE. HOWEVER THE PLASTIC VALVE IS WEAK AND SNAPPED OFF FROM THE WEIGHT OF THE GARDEN HOSE. I HAVE WROTE TOE THE MANUFACTURER FOR A REPLACEMENT VALVE BUT NO ANSWER YET.
B00FNUQAGU|1|Junk.  I went through 3 of these and finally bought another brand.  Each one gave me a different problem.
B00BG3WXA0|5|Fit right in and cured the problem. As long as it lasts now cant go wrong<br />I used the torques app and the obdll reader that I bought here to diagnose the problem. Love it when all works well
B000CPLRB4|4|No turn signals for 2006 Ford E 350 before part installation, turn signals working perfectly after.
B009XQ5ZAC|5|Fit and lookg great
B00MIZT7OK|5|i love having this on my key chain. unfortunately its a close range weapon and you have to aim  for a good spot with it, but it should do enough to hopefully startle the attacker so you can run. I havent had to use it yet, but i feel more comfortable with it.
B000C560OI|5|Moog makes great products, this is one more of them
B00ROSXT0E|5|If they come in a Bluecell package, these are superb.  Well built and worked perfectly.  Would and will buy again.
B00C7I4XXS|5|Can't beat the price on this. I use this to fill my small outboard motor.
B00KWQRC4O|5|Great addition to the car. My family loves to lay trash in the car floor so I purchased this to prevent it. They are still doing it, but at least now I have a place to tell them to pick it up and put it. Doesn't take up a lot of room but offers enough room for trash and other compartments for tissue, wipes. etc.
B00A23V3EM|5|Fit perfect and not a problem with it so far.
B000LNBLTK|5|Handy to have.
B00HTADIOY|5|I have used Posi-Lock connectors for many years. They usually last for many years. I have had a few melt in spots internally in high power situations and even crack. As long as you twist them tight they hold their grip for years even in a 10,000 lb truck with a highly modified diesel off road vehicle. They have decent resistance against corrosion but if wires are in an exposed location they will rust and get crusty inside. They still usually maintain their connectivity despite the wire's deterioration.<br /><br />I use these for most automotive electrical projects. I often prefer these over crimp and solder filled connectors. Much faster and easier than soldering and heat shrinking in hard to reach locations. Only thing they can't do is join more than two 10 gauge wires together. I also use the wire taps and various sizes in the different colors they offer. I used to be able to pick these up at local parts stores but for many years they have become very hard to find. Glad to be able to order them from Amazon. Even when I think I've ordered enough to have spares I keep needing more.
B001DCC2D2|5|Excellent fitment replaced old parts on 2008 nissan titan.
B00BFSYJIA|5|Just as expected.
B00BUKCEZS|5|Best ring installation tool one can buy! Bought a 75.5mm tool for 75.5mm piston, could not wait for the machine shop and tested out the tool on a 75mm bore and piston, worked great. I believe there is a little wiggle room on installation size. Tool is great with no risk of damaging rings, no more need to hammer a piston in.
B00MH56BHC|4|Only 4 stars because the sizing is confusing...this was WAY too small!
B003JT111Q|2|Not as pictured. The boot we received had the longer section at both ends. Required lots of cutting. The material is dense and hefty for silicone. Hard to cut smoothly. If it had arrived as pictured it would have saved over an hour of cutting and testing to fit.
B008032PCA|5|We've had a 2000 chevy astro sitting around for 2 years ! Ordered this , had my uncle help me install it and its up and running again! Ive been using the van for work and school until i can get another car amd it runs great! Mechanics gave me estimates of $300+ to get it running again and im so in love with this purchase! Would definitely recommend and purchase again!
B004W0QISM|2|Foam is so soft that the support is just not there. Plus due to the lack of firmness it does not want to stay in place very well on the armrest in the door. Just not worth the money
B00HDMEUCW|4|Perfect just what I need for my car after my workouts.
B000ENOPO0|5|This is a great product and use it all of my lawn equipment and it works great, at preventing flats and leaks.
B00L847P3C|5|Perfect fit, packed well, quick delivery. No installation issues. Thanks!
B004EIDD2Q|5|Good little charger, hasn't failed me yet.
B007RVQXRO|5|Worked out really good and fast delivery.
B002G2261G|4|c
B000FP1QT4|5|Just what I needed. easy to install
B00DI3DV6G|4|In the smaller two pockets the divider doesn't go all the way down, and I wish the walls were a little more sturdy, that being said it's still a pretty good product, I am considering buying a second one, as I am an over-prepared person and like to keep a lot of things organized in my vehicle, &#34;just in case&#34;
B000VT5776|4|I bought these mainly to keep the rain out of my Jeep when I need to crack a window. For some reason, water runs toward the front of the vehicle, inside it and then down my leg. As a bonus, they also keep wind and noise WAY DOWN when driving with the windows open. My wife's hair barely moves at all now. She loves that.<br /><br />About the actual product, they feel a little flimsier than I would have liked (especially for the price) but I really don't care as long as they work. And I'm a little concerned that they are applied with 3M tape inside of the window channel. They stick to the felt thing that runs along the inside. Don't know how long they'll hold thete but we'll see. I'd buy again.
B000CB13B2|5|Good deal
B00WAOS9B6|5|perfect
B002HAVB0Y|2|Although i says this is an exact fit for my 2004 Buick Rainier. it is a completely different peddle. Could someone please contact me? I have attached what the current pedal looks like when i took it off to replace it.
B001L9VTTA|4|I am not sure what the other reviewer is talking about.  My letters were not individual.  This is lettering on white sticky paper and clear plastic on the other side.  You pull off the clear plastic then place letters onto auto glass.  Push down on them repeatedly so they will remain in place during the next step. (That part is important!)  Then pull off the white sticker and all of the letters are still on the glass where you put them (if you pushed on them).  Yes, they are smaller than they look though.  Too small to really read unless you have excellent vision or are at a stop light directly behind.  As you can see from my Borg cube the other picture above the writing tells most of the story and you know without reading what it says.
B00IACGFOA|5|This is exactly what they tried to sell us at the place where we bought our new motor coach.  Much less expensive, though!<br /><br />This gives us piece of mind.  There are so many electronic pieces in this 44 foot bus we have, plus our AiO computer sometimes, that we are happy to have this.  Even happier to have beat the price at the RV place!
B001R93K0K|5|Applies easy and stays on! Great deal.
B004UPZXQM|5|I just bought a brand new black truck. This product is awesome! Doesn't leave streaks or spots. Erases water marks. Leaves the truck with a mirror finish and no swirl marks. I also use it on the glass. Excellent product!!!
B00P1TDM28|5|Wonderful product! Helped me with my sciatica treatment!
B010C9RMFO|2|Very cheap glue pulling kit not helpful at all glue doesn't hold to the tabs very well got nowhere fast the picks where helpfull
B000DLBIGG|1|I know there's lots of good review online for this horn, that's why I bought it.  It took a while for me to install them to my 2010 Prius.  They turned out to be quieter than the stock horn.  Just simply terrible.  And since I took my time to install the horns, I can't even return these now :(  Definitely not recommended.<br /><br />And in case anyone think that I might have not installed them properly - I reviewed and followed the instructions on youtube.com.  Both horns work, they are just really not loud.
B00Y16E92O|5|We bought these mates for my husbands Nissan Titan truck and they are working out great.
B00HS4NSZ0|5|Item delivered on time, was as described and a very nice product, packed good would rate A+ all the way !
B00GHSLYN6|5|What a easy fix to a complex issue.  I was told I would have to replace my whole door panel @ $600. a piece.  Kind of pricey for 3 doors.  Bought this and watch some you tube vids and poof all my doors are working for very little $$.
B0089LTJDQ|4|It's very good but expensive
B0053P69IO|4|Just finished installing the the Curt hitch to my 2012 Toyota Sienna. The hitch is good, but the installation is hard for one man operation. I have posted my installation tricks and review on youtube. Hope it help you to make a good decision. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWRa8kJR55c
B0002SRCMO|5|as described
B0010E00T6|5|Fit perfectly and easy to install. Air does crisper and cleaner.
B000FGLQBG|4|This was good!
B00NYC0TU2|5|very high quality and priced right
B00801RIT2|5|installed incredibly easily!
B00M9MY3N2|5|Bought this as a replacement chain for my Triumph Tiger 955i.  Chain seems to be high quality and hasn't given me any issues in the 1000 or so miles i've put on it recently.
B0051MYL8E|5|A great value. I use these pads mostly for hand application of cleaner and wax, but they are so inexpensive that I also use them for coating my tires and other chores around the house.
B000EPT4U8|5|I'm not even sure why I felt compelled to replace my factory one, but I did. This was perfect for my application, though it seems to require 2 of them. great price for factory original.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|this car trash is very good for my car. I like it .It easy for children. I have this product  from big discount.
B00UHCGOOM|5|Perfect for the price and shipped very quickly
B00K35UP52|1|Cheap. Threw it away
B006HT9JSM|5|Looks great and seems to be of good quality
B00DHQ5TZ0|5|Quick delivery.  Item as described.
B00NH5CAE4|5|I had to get replacements for my arm rests in my 03' F-250 SD Lariat due to my dog, Richmond makes quality leather replacements. Easy to slide on and tight with no sag or excess. Easy 5 Stars
B003RF8VEC|5|Wife loves it for long rides!
B00XXKUR3O|2|The decal was what it was presented to be however it was rolled up and smashed. A lot of wrinkles in it and now it looks bad. Waste of money.
B00L4V9ECY|5|Great quality and the cheapest price around. These even come with braided cloth covered wire, Nice touch the wire is soldered and heat shrinked. They also include 8 scotch lock connectors(not my favorite connector but there in the box if you want to use them). They all measured 6ohms well less than 1% tolerance.<br /><br />PS. don't mount these anywhere near anything that can burn or melt they can get 300+ degrees.
B007R4GKWY|4|A little on the small size but fits good.
B000C9JSBG|5|Fit perfect on my 1995 Grand Am.  Stopped the problem with the check engine light coming ON after lifting my foot off the gas pedal.  Got to the point where the idle was so fast that I was going 45 MPH without touching the gas.  Easy to install with just one electrical connector and two T25 torks bolts.  This is just a potentiometer (variable resistor) that tells the computer the position of the throttle plate.  Probably fits a wide variety of GM vehicles.
B00AJWBQSY|3|Mine's falling apart after 16 months in Tucson. I use it daily. The inside portion of it is disintegrating. My wife hates it because the crinkling noise when I roll it up is loud. I'd like to find something else.
B000CQ4DK0|5|It's Grease
B00062ZNEA|5|Worked great easy to clean
B00SH00DSO|1|No it didn't fit my car the vehicle that it says it is for it isn't for. The 2014 Kia Rio
B00E80ZG9S|5|Cool, stylish valve caps that I use on my motorcycle. I love them!
B000N9M48O|5|GOOD THING I GOT THESE. MY WASHERS WERE BROKEN.
B00AM1SBP8|1|These things were a great big let down! Bought these for my 05 Camry they were too short for the front windows. Requested a return label and TuningPros makes you pay for return shipping. Any reputable company would pay for return shipping, when they offer an inferior product.  Very disappointing...I will never deal with this company ever again.
B0050I0VNS|1|Remote lock and unlock stopped working after  about a week
B008HE71BW|5|Absolutely perfect match! You would never know it has been replaced by looking at it!
B00LEBLI82|1|One bulb fell apart when installing and another has stopped working. . The light output is far lower than with the incandescent bulbs, Would like to have them replaced, but cannot find how to contact. Bulbs continue to fail.  No bulb has lasted more than a month.
B00EO0RN5M|5|Everything worked just fine. I didn't use the spark plug as we already had some new NGK's. Fired up on the first try. As to performance, this was for a relative and he says it runs better than before, but I think that's because the CDI was sending such a low voltage it was just getting weaker and weaker over time. Just my opinion. I would recommend this product.
B00DK1APUQ|5|Drove over to Palm Springs where the temperature was 113.  Worked like a charm.  Even the people we were visiting commented on how much cooler the car was compared with the shades they were used to.
B00BSXH0X8|5|Installed itself with a littlr bit of electrical tape. No more light on the dash.<br /><br />Worked great for the PCV on my Gsxr-600 mjs / Yoshimura trc exhaust setup. Removed pair valve cables and let springs hold butterfly valve open.<br /><br />The best solution for new gixxers.
B00PB0YCDU|4|These worked great on my girlfriend's 1997 Dodge Intrepid. They don't really fit very well onto her wiper arms but for a generic product that wasn't a big surprise. They still work very well and fixed the terrible wiping ability of the old stock wiper arms.
B00KHUQ9NK|5|Fits on my wheel well and quite comfy.
B001GQ0QB0|5|great love it / thank you
B00G9W9ANG|5|Love stuff sack
B000CJ6080|5|Nice looking wire set. Wires arrived on time . The wires were factory marked #'s 1 thru #4, very nice set.
B000C5UFVM|5|Great seller with best product.
B00DCG6ZO4|5|Excellent product!
B000MD4YKM|5|Very nice Grease gun.
B00OXZD9F6|5|Perfect part!!!
B002HUBA14|5|Great price and quality.
B00144B9YW|5|Easy to install,  good quality
B009RC2HVC|5|Great part. Great price.
B004J0PCQE|5|As advertised.
B003EAOSME|1|Can't see anything with these lights.
B0002F68IQ|5|Was more than I could ever expect. Very happy with the fit and material. Works great in keeping the Sun out.
B001AVVZT8|5|Excellent
B0055FFMGM|5|Amazing!!!
B0022ZQPAU|5|Excellent
B009E9IZBE|4|Wording fades but works good!!
B00FFZU1S6|5|I do around 600 miles a week on my Versys 650 so use this 3-step system each weekend. The chain cleaner is incredible - spray on, use a brush to get the worst of the muck and grime off, leave for about 10 mins and then wash off with the garden hose. The chain appears like new. Proceed straight to the lube which does a good job of driving out all the water and lubing the internal workings.<br /><br />I take the bike for a quick 5 minute ride to warm up the chain (per the instructions) and apply the chain wax. I leave it to set overnight. The end result is a well cleaned and lubed chain with no fling whatsoever. Definitely easy to use and gets the job done with minimal fuss
B002OP7Y2G|5|Made the bike look much sleaker and a heck of a lot nicer
B00A3HFGMW|4|I like it but it doesn't look like it will last.
B0006IX7TW|5|Thanks
B00LOQ57PC|5|If you want tightly packed cigarettes, use a pen cap to push the loose tobacco in the tube
B006P89H00|4|Love my patch, just wish it was a iron on so I wouldn't have to sew it on
B004RCOUP8|5|This is a simple device which I use to connect a water hose to the city water connection in my RV. It makes for a neat-looking connection, directing the hose straight down, rather than hanging out from the trailer body.
B000CNNKCU|5|Good product.
B000GKD5NI|5|Live in Florida and wanted a shade onstead of tint of rear window. Cuts down sunlight but allows you to easily see through it.
B00KGIDNFK|5|Quick service and help to resolve my problem.
B000E4OL52|4|Fits perfect works great,
B00MHODM52|1|Hefty &#34;original shipping&#34; amount will be deducted when return. This is just cover, better off spend a little bit more on real cap which look more professional and won't peel off.
B01182M7OU|5|I hate having a hot car especially in the summer. Getting into a car that is steaming hot can make your day start off on the wrong foot and mess up your entire day. I don't want to be in a rush and get into a car that's hot and get burned from my leather seats or dashboard. I recently got the opportunity to try out this windshield that is suppose to block out the sunlight.<br /><br />I put into my Acura and my Nissan sedan car. I haven't used the side clings because I would have to cut them and I haven't done so. I gave them to my boyfriend to use in his tractor trailer truck and he said they fit good without him having to really cut them at all. So in other words it was til useful. He said they give him a little shade while he's driving but they don't block out everything in total. He did say they are similar to the tints on his car. I love that now I have an extra sunshade to use in my other cars. All the pieces are being used and fit well as they are suppose to fit and do it's job.<br /><br />I recommend this sunshade because it fits in both of my cars. I also like how it doesn't cost too much only costing $23 which is a reasonable price. My biggest concern was it not fitting because although some say they are big they aren't and keep sunlight still coming into the car making it like a sauna. I love that this can be used in both of my cars and not just one. It is the size it says it is in the description.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above in exchange for review from Giveaway Service website. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. Reference ID: pmd1647f2613d1290aaddc5a88a73138c7
B000M5W25E|5|Boy I can see now.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works very well and I've had no issues with it whatsoever. It's a bit bulky but when it comes to your car and knowing what's wrong you can't compromise for going cheap.
B008CH3YJM|4|Nice
B007TG7HVI|5|Awesome!
B000NS0W3E|5|Excellent
B00ACGI1GW|5|great
B00D1CQVIY|1|I installed this on my Yamaha Rhino and let the new light run for 15 minutes to test everything out.  I noticed after about 5 minutes the harness, switch, and relay started getting very hot.  The insulation on the wire started to melt in spots exposing the bare copper and eventually shorting out.  I'm very happy that I decided to test this in the garage and not get stuck out off roading with a shorted electrical system. Needless to say I will not buy this again for my next project
B00E9GVXI4|4|Easy installation. Seems to be made well, but only time will tell.
B003LUPH2M|4|c
B0057B52GE|5|Looks great it was very easy to install
B0051DS5US|5|Very good product bought for my GTR but it is limited to 700whp which is not a down fall gets the job done.
B005EIHCI6|3|Very overpriced.
B000CNKUGO|5|Properly matched to use and care in forming a necessary gasket with a sharp cutter will save you a lot of money. Be aware of its use and be prepared to purchase specialty gaskets when necessary.
B000SOFE86|5|Love it
B005G9C6YS|4|Easy upgrade prompted by a burned out dome light. I only wish the kit included the visor, console and glove box lights.
B000CIT2LS|3|Worked well for the first 3 years and then rusted out .
B00H9S71LW|4|Just got this yesterday and ran a couple quick tests to make sure it worked on my car and with the apps on my phone. I initially tested it with the OBDLink app that pairs with this device in the play store. It only took a few minutes to get the device plugged in, paired with my phone and I was reading data through the app. The response does seem pretty quick. I didn't notice much of a delay if any between my engine revving and the app displaying the performance figures. I also tested it with the Torque Lite app as I planned on buying the pro version as an alternative option to the app that comes with the adapter. It paired pretty quickly with the Torque app as well so I ended up buying the pro version.hen I went to test the pro version I started having some connection issues with the car. It would connect with the adapter but was having problems connecting to the cars ECU. I ran it several more times and kept having the problem. I wiggled the adapter a bit in the OBD port on the car and reran the app again. Finally the app connected and was getting readings. It seems like getting the adapter to seat properly in the OBD port is a bit finicky. The adapter doesn't go on as far as I would think it would but it does hold on pretty securely. So if you do have issues connecting to the car and not the device try adjusting the adapter a bit in the port and see if that helps.
B00MBPLPII|5|Awesome!
B0046QZXLU|5|It works perfect in a 1998 Isuzu Rodeo.
B00RPGWE9C|5|couldn't be happier, fits in place great, no trimming required, feels good, easy to clean up, and because of the spikes on the back, these things stay in place like you wouldn't believe. I'll be buying more for my wife's escape. The drivers side mats use (rather than ignore like the WT mats) the studs in the floor.
B00BPYG3WY|4|A LOT larger than I thought it was going to be, however, it was cool looking and solid metal, can't ask for much more out of a key chain.
B00K55JMKY|5|Fits like a glove!. it works like a charm as well
B004VGAJOG|5|Bought these for a friend's car. The auto store wanted $22 for one handle, we got all four for around $10. He watched a YouTube video and installed them in minutes. Great deal
B000E472DK|1|Item is not a siutable sub. It's to small and hard on the eye. I had to take it out due to getting headache from trying to see out of it.  I would send it back but the cost to return is over half the price to it cost to purchase. I'm not happy at all!!!
B00MTHLPKG|5|Arrived sooner than expected and exactly as described.
B00CI8XPFY|3|the decal is tiny. size of a wallet picture.
B000NSMXPY|5|Great Product at the right price.
B00VC1GDZM|5|Easy installation, perfect fit
B008WH45ZE|5|Very Happy
B001GJ3E2K|5|Very good product
B00JH1HJXE|4|Great Lugs for the price. Ive had them for a few months and only complaints are that they faded on the sides that have the splines but its hardly noticeable since my rims hide the sides well. The front is still polished and looking good though. Oh and the socket included with mine snapped when removing my old lugs. Maybe it was just a defect, maybe not but i had another so i was cool with it.
B006Z98JFS|5|Bought my first two in 2013, using them on my Honda GX620-670 LPG fueled generator packaged in a Winco PSS8BW4.  Fit perfect, performed well and have never had any issues.  Just ordered 3 more.
B00CASDZKC|4|Product works well.<br />However, I did see better priced equally as good.
B0007LVJ2A|5|Excellent product.  Very sturdy with a weather cover for the lock.  Superb, especially for the price.
B006C2R6RA|5|I liked the product
B000GU293U|5|It looks like Christmas when I apply my brakes.
B0081TGYVQ|5|works great
B000COCOBW|5|Awesome Brake Pads and best price on Amazon!
B00LNHBDXW|1|didn't fit intended vehicle.
B00PW30TTC|1|I bought this bulb because halogen bulb for my car not very well Bright replaced with this called led bulb the bright for this product is very poor don't buy
B007AV2XZM|3|Not a terrible sticker, but you can definitely tell it's not professionally done. Print job is quite evident. Was originally intended for my car but ended up putting it on a Pelican case.
B003UVCY00|5|Finally a great flashlight that is strong & really shoots a long beam so you can really see. We live in the boonies & lots of scary critters out there that we like to look at and of course they like to come around at night. So we can bust them easily with this light. And good for scaring coyotes off if you have tons of them in your area like we do. Just a a good light to keep handy & very comfortable in the hand.
B000F7VKD4|5|Very good product
B0057PFJW2|4|Not  suited for safety issues with my car, I had to send it back. For the price it was a nice car seat cover.
B00ATGAONS|5|I love this mount very sturdy.i installed this mount in my truck in march and it still  has not lost its suction.
B002MGPFPU|5|I love it. Perfect for my shed, light weight fold's up nice and easy to store.
B002XM5G70|5|Excellent purchase.  Use it to spray all kinds of water soluble solutions like deck cleaners, brighteners, etc. using a garden spray nozzle on the outlet end.  Probably good idea to run water through it after done in case the solution might not be good for all the seals and soft materials inside.  It uses more solution but so much easier and faster to use this than hand-held gallon pump sprayers that you pump up by hand.
B00C5HCDGK|4|Be aware that what is in the picture is not what you get.  I went with these because it had a smooth step. but when they came it was a perforated step. the fit was great and installed quickly
B004IV8NBU|5|My mustang easily gained over 9000 HP. I can drag race a Bugatti and win with no problem at all. My car topped out at 321mph on the track. Best mod ever made
B000PAS2YG|5|It works well. Its a filter
B000KC41FS|5|Worked as advertised
B00X7DURKU|4|It works ok.  Definitely got my turn signal speed back to normal after LEDs. The only thing a little strange is after you turn off your flasher it keeps going for a click or two before it stops.  I installed it in a 91 Silverado, and the pins were backwards, so I had to make a harness.
B00SD9E9LQ|5|- item is excellent.<br />2- I noticed a fuel saving on my chrysler srt8 2006. The fuel last for 350mile out side town AC is on.<br />3- I tested it while crusing at 160Mile/Hour, and was perfect, smooth and easly able to go more :)<br />4- I also noticed that the car stability has been improved.<br />Thanks to Amazon for their continues good recommendation of products that we don't know.<br />Thanks to the supplier.<br />The part is made in Germany.<br />Again all my appreciation to Amazon. I really like you guys.<br />Will you hire me :)))
B00JSDGC3Y|3|great deal nice product but the box was smashed taped together shipper maybe can spend more than 1min. on caring what is being sent out.
B00DBEMKF0|3|Odd. And cheap
B000CQ49C2|2|these crack very easily when trying to remove them. I am on my 3rd one
B00SL2NFLA|5|great stuff leaves a shine on the car or any item go's on nice and easy
B00S77OHCU|4|Strip does a good job and looks good too.
B005C5CDOY|5|Nice bag.
B00NWF6FT0|4|I did not realize it had to be programed. But Chevy took care of it for free !
B002TIIHVK|1|Total garbage. China quality. Can see daylight through the cheap loose seams. I sent it back an got the Smittybilt.
B00KMKWUSS|1|This is a horrible option for side rails, they false advertise that cross bars fit on them and they dont. When they say frequently bought together and offer a cross bar option, than the cross bars won't fit!!!!! Don't ever buy these!!!!
B00LDO0P1Q|5|works great!
B00GBBE6CA|5|It's great it delivered sooner and fits perfectly in my camry very satisfied
B00I1JV6GY|5|awesome but a little bit of defects
B00EU1DDSQ|5|👍
B000SBCHCA|5|Works great to relocate a bluetooth OBD2  scanner out of your footwell.  Excellent  price.
B000FW2MCM|4|It's rather difficult to adjust, being how you have to do it in your car while driving in circles to acclimate to the vehicles magnets, but once that painful process is over it's very useful and sophisticated looking for your drives where you easily get lost without direction
B0010AYJEC|5|Perfect, looks great!
B003KIYDAM|5|A great patch kit that would work great for lawn tractor, and bicycle tire repairs.
B00NRV9TWO|5|Got projector headlights off eBay for our 2012 Forte5 SX. Ordered the 4300K kit and single beam harness/relay. Easy install. Pretty much plug and play. Color and brightness are great. Highly recommended.  UPDATE January 28,2016. Nearly 6 months and still 5 stars as far as I'm concerned. Now that they've got some hours on them, they seem whiter and brighter. A friend with a 2015 Forte EX liked how ours looked so she got them for her car.
B00FXLJ8U4|5|i got these for mine and my daughters vehicles. we have baby and those carseats are so hard to get the baby out of. we were afraid if we ever got in to an accident we wouldn't be able to get them out in time. the button on the carseats takes a lot of strength to press down. i dont know if its a safety feature so kids won't open them themselves or what but its a huge hassle just getting them out normaly. now if we were in an accident and hurt our thumbs or hands we would really have an issue. these give us a sense of relief knowing if something happened we would be able to get them out quick.
B00HJE5GI6|5|Brighter than expected. With just the outer one installed,  you can see even in daylight how much brighter they are.
B00DUZ7JKQ|5|Nice, inexpensive relays!
B006TMOK4U|4|fit very well.
B003MB4NUC|5|What I wanted
B00HLPMEK6|1|did not even come close to fit,after i talked to salesman , and was assured it would.thank goodness for millright freind.
B002TZSKO2|5|Excellent quality. Very fast shipping.
B00D8RYGOI|5|Great product!! Very rapid shipping and delivery. Well made product. Would definitely purchase product again and use same seller!!
B00U1RGTL6|4|CUTE FOR MY TEENAGER
B000GBQ6MY|4|I and my dad have pretty big heads. Most of the time we shop in a store so we can test the fit. Could not find a fit with this design anywhere locally so decided to risk it. This helmet is great. I have another other HJC full helmet that I love, this one is very similar in features. The XXL was a perfect fit. The only small issue is that with the visor up, faster than 30mph a very audible whistle develops. Not sure if I am complaining about something unavoidable but in a hot day, I found it annoying. Not a huge concern tho.
B000FOUWNQ|4|This amplified antenna &#34;Jensen Marine AN150SR AM/FM&#34; Worked Fine.  You must ground the antenna as well as hook up the 12vdc power wire.  I mounted it inside my fiberglass boat horizontally using the supplied double stick tape as high in the cabin as it could conveniently go.  It worked fairly well by itself.  The tape has lasted two months of 85-90 deg F weather.  However I also bought this amplified antenna &#34;BOSS Audio MRANT10 Dipole Hideaway Marine Antenna &#34; and I tested it in a similar placement by itself.  It too worked well.  However when I combined them both with a antenna &#34;Y&#34; connector such as &#34;Metra 40-UV43 Male to Female Motorola Antenna Cable&#34; the combination noticeably worked better receiving more stations and also reducing the noise.  Over the next two weeks at various times of day, with both antennas mounted and hooked up and the amplified antenna turned on, I got the best reception.  If I turned off the amplifier but left antenna attached, the reception quality consistently decreased.
B00TSRT7YQ|4|better price then buying it at an autoparts store! works great...<br /><br />Updated Aug.2017- ac compressor went out, only lasted 2 yrs...i guess...
B008WXL0UQ|5|My son has autism, and this is a great way to tribute him on my car! It sticks well, is easy to apply, and is super cute!! Excellent product and great price! I love how easy it is to place on my window, and how it stays on even through the dirt, grime, hot, wet, and cold. Excellent quality sticker, and a great way to show support for my Autistic son!!
B000UHIT3I|5|worked very well in my race trailer
B009G41GNQ|5|Factory part, factory fit.
B007USCMD8|4|The product work good, no trouble with gauge, I followed directions, goggles, gloves etc. found the right input on the pro website  would be 5 stars, but I had to pay more for this product because I live in CA which added extra cost for my purchase.
B00SJVCRK8|5|This came with well protected in packaging and I was relived that a piece of glass survived the trip. The kit also included plenty of adhesive that made it a quick job to replace my broken mirror.
B002OK8G46|5|After picking up a ATC250R for a cheap price, I started finding problems. The air box was full of moldy almonds that a mouse was happy to stockpile. The filter was in bad shape and could not be re-used. This fit perfect and helped the engine breathe right at 10k feet above sea level in the rockies.
B000FUMWTM|3|It ok.
B00BMVF3ZS|3|Fair
B007SRY7KM|5|The dark smoke tint on the windscreen looks way better than the stock clear plastic. Easy to install and the part seems well constructed. When I took it out of the box, 2 of the wellnut holes looked to be warped so I thought that may make the install difficult but it didn't prove to be a problem. 5 stars to me!
B000C4087Y|4|Very good filter.
B000I9TPDG|3|Fits a little lose
B000C2GHZS|5|Very good price and haven't had a problem highly recommend this product..
B00IU89MBW|5|These are awesome for the price! Exact fit for an 06 Street Glide and matches up perfectly! Well worth the $150+ savings over what Harley dealerships wanted. Bonus points when my girl said it was more comfortable with it than without!
B00GURQAP6|5|It gave me that extra 2-3 mph top end. Also the take off is very evened out, compared to stock. great product, with that same great shipping.
B00T62RK1U|2|They are bright and we're easy to install... however they are not water proof.. they leak and have water in them only after a week of being mounted on my truck. I purchased a new set and took them completely apart and siliconed everything myself. There was no real water or weatherproofed on the inside from the factory. The new pair are working great.
B00EW44IIK|4|These covers work well in my new Jeep Renegade.  The red is a tad orangey, just as well as the Jeep is orange!  They were quite easy to fit and appear reasonable quality, though time will tell as we have dogs.  So far I am pleased with this purchase and they were well packaged so arrived intact.
B00774EY9A|5|Fun little gift for almost anyone. Low maintenance, and comes with some seeds to start you off.
B00I9SK8WK|5|Item as described
B003K5S4NW|5|2011 Hyundai Sonata Gls perfect fit
B0095S5I3W|5|Very fine
B000EDST24|5|the screen door sticks and this opener makes you lift up on the corner at the same time releasing the latch, Works great
B00803BIAU|5|Look fabulous and an excellent value.
B000ZFPVRW|5|Exact replacement for old light.  Easy to wire in and attach.
B004K388WK|1|Could not get this to work no matter how kind tried. All it removed was the &#34;road grime&#34; that build up outside the path of the wiper blades. Misleading when they say it removed light scratches.
B000JZ33H8|5|My original flasher on my Excursion needed replacement anyway, and even more so when I switched to LED signals.  They were blinking fast before.  This cured the problem and is holding up well.  Now I have normal paced signals again.
B005STNMVW|5|Beautiful. Compliments my 2014 Lancer Evo perfectly and fits the little hooks just right.
B00BKTJ8XK|4|Saved me a $700 repair job.  Worked perfectly.  Dinged one star because the shipping is grossly overpriced (should be about $2 since they come US mail) but other than that, perfect for the job.<br /><br />Do keep in mind it's probably sensible to order 3 of them, as that's how many there are in total and in my case,  one of the existing gears was completely broken while the others were worn. Replacing all three makes the seat assembly good as new.
B004GZMQS4|5|The chrome Bull Bar worked very well, looks good and I would recommend it to any one interested in purchasing one.
B00RVDUSTW|5|great!!!!
B008Y9DPDI|5|I can see out my back window so much better now. Took me a long time to figure out there is no after market replacement for rear wiper for my Saturn Vue and I would need a GM part. So glad I found it here. Bought 2 in case I can't find it again.
B000676MJA|5|Works well
B00A9OD0MW|4|One spot on the front is starting to fade after a few months. Used it to mount a lightbar. Sturdy and we'll built. Wish it had hooks to replace the factory ones you lose putting this on.
B0078J1T9M|5|These decals are an appropriately scaled size for a  (car or truck) bumper or rear window: they're not too &#34;look at me&#34; big, nor too timidly small. Also the application thereof is not difficult.
B007R690JC|5|these blades fit my son's 1998 Volvo perfectly! fast shipping on amazon prime! A+++
B00K7I0LUO|5|I am very pleased it's great
B00OHNABSC|5|Great product for a great price!
B003BUCNNS|5|Had no issues with these plugs so far.
B00PPU7PXU|5|Great sticker!  Put it on my canoe
B0002TDUW4|5|My son painted the floor of his jeep with this and it looks good. He's only 16 so he was a little messy but he likes it.
B00NMP59VK|5|CV BOOTS ARE NICE BUT BUY THE TOOL FOR THE BANDS
B00MBE0AY4|5|Great looking levers. Perfect fit on my 2012 ninja 650 installation took about 15 minutes. Shipping took about 5 business days.<br />Overall I am very happy with these levers,  highly recommend them.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Great item! Enjoy using it.
B000ALG8QO|5|Color match was perfect.
B000HBGKWE|2|product gave way after a couple of months.  Works for the short term but not a long term solution.
B0042OX8WC|5|Does this work for 2002 civic LX 4 door?
B0073MFV34|1|it is plastic stay a way
B003BZD03K|5|good product exactly as described
B003QSFW06|4|work as advertised
B009YKQR2C|1|Purchased these almost a year ago and was totally happy with them for map lights in my f150 until last month.  The bulbs started flickering and multiple leds have failed on each bulb.
B00EC8XU1C|1|Complete garbage. They look good buuuuuut within a month the LED lights inside burnt out.
B00VVQU2UK|2|These DO NOT work with the silver/shiny type sun visors. Tried to use with sun visor in RV and they fail to hold the visor before even getting near the window. Would love to see product that could be used with these kind of visors.
B003ZLGSQ6|5|This jacket is great!  I like the fact that with the liner it is warm, and without the liner it is cool.  I also like the reflective grey areas and the bright green/yellow areas that allows for high visibility.
B009HLPA6C|5|Perfect fit and my friend is truly satisfied. It's also to install
B00PSRORH2|5|Great! Work just as they're supposed to.
B00IMPEWHM|5|They worked! That's all I can say. Hope these lasts for a long time.....
B00CKDA8WA|3|Small, looks great.  One problem we had was be put it in the dishwasher and off white spots appeared on the bottle.  After another wash, some were removed but some remained.  This will be retired to just a beer growler.
B0012H2MEM|4|Looks great.<br /><br />Have not gotten to use it yet.<br /><br />Went to the desert but it was too windy for the awning.
B007Y88BZ2|4|Worked just as well as original!
B001C6Q7US|5|I have a 2005 Tahoe that while the A/C was on it would suddenly start blowing hot air out of the driver's side vents.  After doing some research on here as well as some Tahoe Forums I determined this had to be the issue.  Even though the Amazon site said this would fit my vehicle, I went to the Dorman web site and confirmed that it was a replacement for the OEM Part in my vehicle which was # 52402588.  Before removing it, I noticed the alignment of the new part line and placed a mirror under the old part still installed and adjusted the temp controls to make sure the line on the old one was in the same place as the new one hopefully eliminating the need to align it to get it installed.  On my vehicle that made temp controls halfway between hot and cold. After removing the old part, the new one went right back in.  Be sure to follow the reset directions included in many of the other posts.  I have only been out in the vehicle 3 or 4 times since installing it and I have not had any problems so far.
B007XE8C74|5|Well designed, easy to use and fits in ones pocket comes with a very reasonable price.
B00YRBUIMI|5|It was exactly what I was looking for.
B00ULNWQ8U|5|Nice design.
B006N91BLY|5|Revitalized my Audi s4's starting process.
B00ZFQNKKG|3|Really designed to be mounted on a small bar - normal size motorcycle handle bars are too large for the mounting hardware.
B00BFDGL4K|5|Works like a charm.
B00C6NPVL2|4|Well worth the cheap price, they are very bright.  The part that plugs into the car lighter is pretty annoying though, that could have been designed better.
B00B3YMOUQ|5|Large useful bags, good zippers. Talked a friend of mine into buying these for a trip. He was complaining they were too big but by the end of the trip, he had them stuffed.
B000C16XM6|1|Only lasted 3 weeks before it broke
B00H7HD9DO|3|Very happy with everything that it came with except for the seat covers. Thin material and already coming apart at the seams. No holes for seatbelts, doesn't fit tightly, and beware if you don't have removable headrests since there's an elastic band and hole at the top of the seat cover instead of the usual subtle slits...
B009FRG5XK|1|I got a gas cap error message less than a month after switching to this gas cap
B000CQI270|3|The threading doesn't match my 50 gal. barrel.  Can't seem to get the threads to catch &#34;Match&#34;.<br />It is the right size and is made of substantial stuff.
B00403LNQI|5|this stopped the swaying while pulling my big chevy van behind the motor home.  well worth the bucks.
B007JSGR9Y|5|looks good had no time to use it, I mean I am intimidated by it.
B00BAZCBVK|5|Works!
B00RQO763C|5|Perfect just what I need for , of all, my Grandaughter.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Super bright replacements for my dome lights.
B0000UUU50|4|Fit well, look nice, high quality materials
B000CM3I9G|5|This mirror was easy to put on over the old glass since old mirror glass wasn't missing pieces only cracked.  I did add some silicon to the top and side edges before mounting to old glass to be sure it stayed on good.  It was the perfect size and fit for my 1999 Tahoe.  Glad I watched u-tube videos since I thought I needed to replace the whole mirror assembly but saw I could just replace the glass.
B00QKXC89W|1|I purchased this product, hoping to be very satisfied, however it did not meet that expectation. The shipping was fast and so was the installation. I installed the relay box outside the firewall, on the lower left section where there are holes for attaching relays. At first, the turn signals working flawlessly, they seemed to be a great addition to my 2015 Polaris RZR. However, after installing the turn signals, I did not drive my RZR for two months. It sat covered in my garage, untouched. When I took it out for a spin in July, the turn signals were fully operational. But, as I started driving it daily for a few days. The relay box would only send power to the front turn signals but send the brake lights to light up, as if I was braking. The more I drove it, the worse it got. Now it just sends a power to both sides when I give the left turn signal. (It is as if i have turned on the hazard lights.) I feel that the relay box is just not robust. The air temperature around the relay box sits around 148 degrees Fahrenheit with plenty of free flowing air. I wish that the design of the relay box was more suited to handle the conditions on board a RZR.
B001OPEX9Y|4|These nested great with my 1.1L GSI pot. Put the fuel inside the pot and it all compacted nicely. Quality material. All you need for backpacking.
B00ANZHG4U|5|Great towels for shop and auto care.
B00CIJ3T1S|4|Very cute decal - ended up buying two so that both our cars could represent the kayaking life when we went on boating trips. Only issue we had is the instructions were a bit unclear, however application went well despite that.
B00CHDFL4I|1|Clips were broken off in package.
B0055EALW8|5|Very fast shipping!  Great product at a great price I highly recommend.
B00B7XCHIC|5|Exact match for use on a 2014 BMW R1200RT.
B0100VTE3M|5|I just buy this today. I need a sun cover for my Nissan sentra SR. It's a  Great deal. I like it.
B002LYQALQ|3|Well built but I had some issues getting the oil out when the level was mid to low. So I end up having to top up the oil frequently.
B00GZLMEN4|5|Best black palstic trim product I've ever used!  I will never use anything else. Way better than armorall
B0043063JU|5|easy to clean great job of trapping dirt
B001PBAEM2|5|I bought these for my 2007 Nissan Altima 4 door car back in April 2015<br /><br />These things still look like new and fit very well.  I have a retainer on my drivers side and the drivers mat just fits right over the<br />top of it so no need to worry that it does not have a cut out and absolute perfect fit.<br /><br />I almost bought weather tech laser cut mats and I am so glad I did not<br />A co-worker bought a set for his vehicle and I chose the weather beater mats.<br /><br />These mats have very nice large carpet spikes to hold them in place for the passenger side and back seats that<br />have no retaining bracket is no problem with my mats the STAY PUT.<br /><br />My co-workers weather tech mats slide around (no carpet spikes) on all of his mats except the drivers side which has the retainer clip<br />his vehicle is an suv and does not have the lip when you step out (at least for the front seats don't but the back doors of his vehicle does)<br />but even his rear seating mats slide around.<br /><br />So if your on the fence go with the weather beaters<br />Better quality, Better Design, and a much much Better price<br />I got full set front and rear for the same price of just the front mat's with weather tech.
B008AH8OMG|5|Received my exhaust very quickly and let me say after installing it and starting up my 2010 tundra double cab 5.7 WOW!!!  Totally Bad ASS!!!  It sounds like a race car!!!  I have not driven it yet but Listening to it in my driveway just puts chills down my neck...  I love it would def recommend to a friend ..
B003Y823H8|5|Fast shipping new and perfect thank you
B00R57VOQU|4|As advertised replacement tail light bulb
B002803D6I|5|great
B00DFSUEOG|3|There decent for the money. Not as sturdy as Honda and Yamaha ones but for 50$ you can't beat it
B00332GMKY|5|Perfect fit. I read a lot of reviews saying that the holes didn't line up, not sure if they didn't install it correctly or what happened, but mine fits exactly the way I hoped it would, and looks great.
B00PFFG1EO|1|Had to return it my husband couldn't get it to connect to wifi. 😑
B003AP584A|4|Material could be a little thicker but I like it. It came with two in the package.
B000WEOQD6|5|Fits and looks perfect.
B0068C4KPK|5|I use this on my CVO Limited!
B005N6WC16|4|My wife LOVED it, but the sizes run a bit small.  Order one size larger than you normally wear.
B000CGFVHO|3|it works
B003RRQM1Y|5|Fixed the problem and still going...
B00CS6W0AC|5|Stoping power is fantastic, and they look fantastic. 5 months in and still no rust on the rotors, the treatment used is fenominal. Carbon fiber ceramic pads are fantastic, I'm never using anything else again
B000GTJD4O|5|I have bought multiple boxes of these gloves. They feel thick so anything you grab you don't feel like you are going to freak out. I have had to keep these gloves on me to pick up some pretty disgusting things, and unlike other gloves, I never felt unclean when touching garbage or other filthy things.
B001B1K35Y|4|I would have given it 5 stars if it was actually water proof. It's only water resistant unless you put the water proof cover on it. Which is really hard to do while you are riding down the road.<br />There is more than enough room to hold everything you need. If you find the bag getting full it has a expansion zipper on the back that makes the bag about 2 inches deeper (Haven't had to use it yet). Great deal. Zippers are pretty sturdy as well. Very impressed
B001AZGJUE|4|Cool pack was rather large. Should work fine
B00GSAUHB8|5|This was exactly what I was looking for. The quality isn't amazing, but very reasonable for the price. It does indeed fold up, and it does a good job of shading my car and keeping it cool in the sun. The shade is lightweight and easy to store (though like all similar products, it's a few minutes of hassle getting it folded up or unfolded - best done without someone in the passenger seat). I definitely recommend this product, with the caveat that since it is lightweight, it seems like it will be fairly easy to rip if you are not careful about how you store it.
B002ZCGRWQ|5|I purchased this to add as a safety stop for my sportrack 2 bike hitch carrier.  I mounted my bike in the rack and drilled the center post just above the securing clamp.  This will prevent the clamp from sliding up and off the top tube of the bike if for some reason the clamp loosens or was not tight enough to begin with.
B00OKK7YEQ|5|I only use mobil 1 oil and filters in all of our family cars.
B002OUQI3W|3|Probably better than nothing to protect your device.
B006G14FK8|4|Takes long to reach final stage led (float stage).
B00G75RKUK|5|is a clear paint and look good
B00GHS6VMA|5|What a easy fix to a complex issue.  I was told I would have to replace my whole door panel @ $600. a piece.  Kind of pricey for 3 doors.  Bought this and watch some you tube vids and poof all my doors are working for very little $$.
B00XD6SMWQ|5|Good quality product... prompt delivery...
B002FDEJ3Y|5|Gives a nice classic look to my bike and reduced the heat on my leg
B006RBK8WQ|5|Nice head light assembly , it just look like the original stock assembly . Couldn't telll the difference. At lot cheaper than the dealership . Replace mine cause my stock was getting yellow ish .
B0087UPTJC|5|Fits and looks perfect on my Civic. No noticeable difference from the OEM product.
B00005OWK2|5|Loved it, very good investment.<br /><br />FAB
B00DMA81FQ|5|excellent for my 07 impreza
B0012RI5IO|5|Rather than mess with wire nuts and splices, I got this to wire the van for my utility trailer.  SOOO easy to install and use!  I checked out the YouTube videos on installation for my particular vehicle before purchasing, so I knew what to expect.  It was even easier than I expected to install and worked great once I had the wiring on my trailer connected.
B00GRNY0KA|2|I don't know if the paint was old on this but it came out of the pen very thick and chunky.  Would not go on smooth at all.  I followed directions exactly as indicated and it looked like crap!  Fortunately I was able to pick it off with my nail.  The small scratch looks better than how this turned out.
B000BZGMX8|2|No problem with fit and installation into a Nissan MAXIMA.  The manufacturer-notes that came with the product says that the buyer gets a lifetime warranty for BRAND-New alternators  and 2-years warranty for re-manufactured.  The original lasted for over 9 years on my Maxima;  my expectation is that this replacement unit lasts for 4 years or longer.  This replacement is a remanufactured unit. **** UPDATE :  Didn't  make a year!!! The (remanufactured) Bosch Alternator  has not even given 12 months service  and it is dead.  My car right now is dead/stranded in a library parking lot.
B003UHNMMS|5|Great quality, especially for 7$
B00C8EA6W8|5|Works perfectly.  I was concerned since it's an involved procedure to disassemble and reassemble the front drivers door.  I would definitely order one again from this manufacturer if necessary.
B00HY06KJE|5|Attention getter. Love it.
B00C5TEV40|5|My RV fridge would only get cold when plugged in. When I tried using LP gas for the fridge, it would light and have the pilot light lit, but would never &#34;open&#34; the valve to actually cool the fridge. After reading and talking to a few people they said it is rather common for these thermocouples to go out. This is what sends the signal to the control board that there is a pilot light, and there is enough heat to &#34;open&#34; the LP gas valve to start flowing. Without this, it would could spell disaster.<br /><br />So, I replaced the thermocouple, and right away my problem was solved. The flame was MUCH higher, and it worked as new. This thing worked great. If you are not getting any cold temps on Lp gas, but are getting cold when plugged into shore power, try this first. It may save you lots of money!<br /><br />My fridge is a 2006 Dometic 2652
B007N6P76G|5|made a huge difference in handling & steering!
B00Y51WFLC|4|Product is great.  I was hoping it would be metal instead of plastic, but it is typical for hub covers I guess.  It looks great and fits my vehicle.  I am glad I bought it and will return to this seller for similar items in the future.
B000C7QHEY|5|Thanks!!!!.... exact fit....
B002JFEETW|5|Are these sunglasses as well made as Ray Bans? Heck no - do they cost $80 bucks - double heck no. If you want a sharp looking pair of sunglasses with good fit and decent lenses that won't make you cry when you leave 'em in the taxi or at the park these are perfect. Get a couple pair.  It's now been several months since I first bought these sunglasses and I have to say I've been so happy with them I bought two more pair. They look and fit great and are really solidly made. I can leave a pair in my briefcase and one in the car and not have to worry about them like the $300 pair of Ray Bans I lost last year. Great product.
B0047RV8WG|1|Don't last long. After a month or so they start blinking. Very annoying as a license plate or kick light
B001ONJM1A|5|Fit great and worked perfectly, some what different from the factory original but doesn't seem to adversely affect anything. great price and good enough quality.
B00KPE78N8|5|Well packaged and cheap. Love it!
B00NPIUFMM|5|Very bright LED bulbs, and they fit well.
B004KEJXSC|5|That's what I needed thank you
B00HH3JWOS|1|Do not waste your money. It does not fit in factory fenders. Tried to screw on to use temp. And right away one broke. Then I got mad and smashed them.
B00HSGNK7O|5|Works great so far. Installed 3 months. Way cheaper than the dealer.
B00008BKX5|5|Allowed me to carry 16ft sections of crown molding without running them through the rear window. Great product for the money!!! Purchased the Darby Industries 968 Black Roof Turbo Rack with it as well.
B00WVN7UWK|5|Brighter than expected.
B001GH1OPG|1|Cheap. Doesn't work. Broke immediately.
B0028JW4PU|4|Works great, heavy duty, lifts my lifted Trailblazer no problem. Only improvements I'd suggest for this product is a handle to make it easier to carry, and a pin to keep the adapters from falling out and getting lost.
B00HESFIJ4|5|Accuracy consistent with other gauges in shop.  Easy to use, holds reading.
B008OITNIK|4|I foresee these liners lasting a long time, even with rough use - the material is a fairly stiff, decently thick plastic. You will wear down the ribs before you wear a hole in it (I'll keep this review updated.) The fit is pretty good, on the gas-pedal side the liner hugs the center console tightly, my boots never catch on the edge. The door edge is a bit looser, and overlap over the door runner is a bit clunky - it doesn't lay flat but is more of a raised lump, and doesn't cover the whole edge (although i am not sure it could).<br /><br />A couple things to point out, first, the photos aren't of the same model - but very similar in appearance. The liners i received do not come with caps for the OEM floor clips, which is a bummer as its just a hole right down to the carpet below. I was also surprised (and the reason for taking off a star) to find that the liner doesn't fully cover the drivers foot-rest, instead ending just under halfway up - this is a pretty big deal to me, i have long legs, and that is the only place to leave my left foot - meaning mud, water and ice will just drip down the footrest and under the liner anyway. I simply can't understand this design decision.<br /><br />Finally, despite amazon's claims, this model -does- in fact fit a 2013 Extended cab Tacoma. If in doubt, go to the manufactures website and match the model number, keeping in mind that there are different model numbers if packaged with liners for the backseat.
B004X96DPA|5|Would be better if it had a bigger brush head and not some looking like nail tip
B008D8H3JC|4|TORC (T50 Route 66) 3/4 Helmet has strong construction, great graphics & a deluxe lining. BUT... 5 snap flat face shields that fit size medium Bell, HJC, Bilt & other helmets will NOT fit this helmet. The two lower snaps aren't even close. (See Photo, the black snap & slot are where all flat shields have the lower snaps. I added the silver snaps to the shield ) Also,  these helmets apparently run small so you better like a tight fit OR order a size larger. Maybe they are ment to fit &#34;Snug&#34; as it seals all around the ears making a quieter ride with somewhat less wind noise. After modifying my shield by adding 2 more snaps it might work out.
B00TI7CYBO|5|I liked it 😊 so much I bought another one
B000HPNWAI|3|These adjusting bolts do the trick ok, once you figure out the way you need to have them installed.<br /><br />The problem I was having, is that they decreased the diameter of the main shaft, except the cam portion.  This is a problem, because the holes in the bracket on either side of where the cam lobe is, are still that same larger diameter.  So you get a lot of slop in this adjustment.<br /><br />I know, the tabbed washer is supposed to take up this gap, under the head side.  But that really isn't enough.<br /><br />These need to come with some shoulder bushing style washers (that would combine a bushing and a washer); or the manufacturer needs to spring the extra money to make a better bolt.  One that is the stock diameter all the way; with an offset portion in the middle.
B004AIHKT2|5|Great buy on a great replacement part. Far superior from the factory  plastic piece. Did it myself and saved Alot of money. Easy fix.
B00DJQDBGW|1|This item came with very little in the way of instructions. One thing the few lines of directions don't tell you is that the engine and A/C must be running - and functioning, so it cannot be used for diagnosing a non-working A/C system. I don't know what else one would use it for. I contacted the company several times to find out the proper use (and I am not a novice mechanic).<br />There's a toll-free number for calling the company, but the people I talked with seemed unfamiliar with the product. I did get better answers when I contacted them by email.<br />I'm grateful to Amazon for accepting it back as a return and covering the postage!
B00TEPMKA0|5|I really love this case! I would definitely recommend it
B003CWRQ6E|3|I have a 2005 Mustang GT Coupe. This cover is an excellent material and keeps my car covered, clean, and dry. BUT it leaves my front lip and about 4 inches of the rear valence exposed. Additionally parts of it fit tight to the point of stress on seems and pulling on my mirror/antenna. Although I specified that I have a GT, these covers probably only fit the V6 bumper, too bad.
B00ORDI23S|1|purchased for my wifes 2007 H2. Bottom covers fit fine, top covers were molded incorrectly with a recess that the factory parts didn't have, so they would not fit. Waste of money.
B00R0SBFV8|5|Everything was perfect.
B0010GHCYA|5|Item was expected and ship was quick.
B00SUNH7GY|4|This kit is great, but......takes 5 hours to install. I am skilled at working on vehicles and houses so this is coming from someone who's halfway handy.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is where the lights connect to wires could be a bit smaller plus having to be Vaccumed sealed at each connection is very time consuming.<br /><br />Everything else is satisfactory but be advised you will take longer than 4 hours to properly install on a cbr1000rr. Tip: avoid heat pipes like exhaust and header. Zip ties included were very helpful.<br /><br />Looks great though! Not a fun project to do but worthwhile!
B005U80UQ6|5|Great pegs for a reasonable price
B000CB0T5S|5|good seal
B003YJCE9E|5|Works as advertised
B00FY4M924|5|Awesome filter! Heavy duty feel, easy install and easy to clean. Very nice look to it, will def dress up your intake and add a great look to any engine.
B006U42QUC|5|Right fit, lightweight and easy to store.
B00GU9A9Z6|5|Good price and very simple to install.
B004J3261K|5|Worked fine on my 2002 Praire 650
B003VDX5D2|5|The Traxion Tailgate Ladder fit like it was advertised, I like it very much. I am a older person and this will a blessing for me getting in and out of the truck bed.
B0022ZSS9Q|4|Decent product
B00946NA2Q|5|Not the correct picture but the correct item
B00895EX7Y|5|I just used this headset during my flight lesson and it worked perfectly. I could hear my flight instructor and the tower crystal clear. I highly recommend this headset. Its well worth the price.
B00CMB6JOG|1|Yes it's bright to look at. The problem is it doesn't shine as far as my original lights. I can only see about 10-15 yards in front of me. On a motorcycle I need more than that at night.
B00B3UTP16|5|Used this clear paint to take care of dents and scratches after painting.
B0028G7Y2G|3|Why u keep switching the price on this item? Bought it for $50 last week now its back to $300. Also not that great of a fit on the 09 camry but fits if u improvise and make a couple modifications. Can't deny that it looks great once its on though.
B0012TT3WO|5|Blisters suck. BroTaper blister busters do not!
B003I6O8XI|5|Good

B007NNK33Q|5|Excellent
B00T47K604|4|Wouldn't fit in a Durango but worked on a number of other vehicles.
B004ZIX08W|5|Excellent
B00F9LPJ8S|2|Complete garbage except for starting motorcycles, evidently good for that. Looking at the picture of the side of the battery, the actual cells are behind the black stripe at the bottom. the &#34;ratings&#34; of this battery are farcical. and compared to other &#34;real&#34; Lithium batteries these are a joke
B004ZJZE8U|5|Excellent
B000JZF6HS|5|Very affordable part.  Fit as expected and the car is running good.
B0016IV8U6|1|Didn't fit my 2006 gmc Sierra
B009IF2I7G|5|Item as described
B000CPCC4U|1|Worst bearing lubricators I have ever seen , the plastic ring allows the grease to bypass it and exit the bearing cup before it ever has a chance to compress the spring
B00ORPGMC4|1|After 3 years, straps broke while I was putting the helmet on. They are basically stuck inside the helmet with some sort of glue that cristalizes. Wrote to airoh and never got a reply. It might be the lightest out there but I would never buy this brand again. Imagine falling and the helmet just falls from your head because of these terrible chinstraps. Terrible quality. Picture was taken after a day of riding in very dusty conditions
B004QJH91E|1|After following instructions exactly, I arrived in Atlanta from Florida to find 2 inches of water in my waterproof bag.
B007PPG0Q6|5|Fixed my headlight problem! I had a corroded ballast and this did the trick!
B003BZQ5F0|5|perfect for attaching Coroplast
B0050ITGGG|4|Quality product as described, good fitment, great price.
B001G64LAM|5|Great
B004CGOGFS|5|Worked great. Couldn't have done the rotors without it.
B00G3YTHKQ|5|Perfect fit for an 02 Jeep Wrangler.
B000C9TD1G|1|Not fit for 2006 Mazda 6 (2.3L), mislead from Amazon part finder.
B000FQ0W1G|5|good air filter
B0040CWUY8|3|Not bad but wrong size
B000BGK25G|5|Just what we needed.
B00407TTEC|5|It fulfilled all my expectations.
B00P9OF4EE|5|Nice product and it has a good scent.
B000GZT3IO|5|Excellent product. Use it on my motorcycle (paint and chrome surfaces) granite countertops in kitchen, bathroom mirrors, and on the car after a wash. I've even used it on the dashboard of my truck.
B00DGWAJDW|5|Great upgrade to replace weak factory plastic connections
B013ME9PII|5|These Helmet Hooks are GREAT! I have one on my '14 Victory Vision to hold my helmet when: making clothes changes, going into a store/bank/gas-station, or just want to put my helmet where it won't drop. Some motorcyclists have become accustomed to hanging their helmets off pegs or mirrors but, with this hook you don't need to bend over to get your helmet or readjust your mirror to ride.<br /><br />Mind you, this isn't a permanent helmet holder (it's meant to be temporary) ... it holds the helmet inverted so if your helmet's left hang for a long time it may catch things (i.e., leafs, debris,...). When my bike's parked in the garage I definitely use the hook! It makes it easy to find the helmet, the helmet's out of the way, and you know which equipment you used last.<br /><br />There's hole in the hook (which doesn't detract from the hook's strength) that can be used to install a small lock (sold separately). The lock's for more security conscious people.<br /><br />I bought one of these for myself and my brother (who uses it on his scooter).<br /><br />I wear a Bell Mag-9 helmet (for the most part) so for anyone who's owned one of these helmets and dropped it a couple of times you know how easily they frag apart. When I rode 'Wings, hooks were built-in to the trunk. But, with other cruisers and touring bikes (such as my present ride) there's nowhere to hang a helmet temporarily. This is a GREAT solution to an old problem at a decent price!
B004J6H568|5|EXCELLENT $ AND QUALITY. NO NOISE WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED.
B00SDL2RVI|5|Received as expected
B0002JVGKW|5|I loved it.  It is the right size to leave in a glove box of a car or saddle bag of a motorcycle<br /><br />FAB
B002N5DE2G|5|These have already saved me. I just wish there were 2 of each size. Guess i just have to order more.
B000L9AD2U|5|even though it has a weird metric thread on the male nipple, the nipple fits in a 1/4&#34; NPT quick connect. Other people have complained about the gauge screws working loose, this has been corrected with rivets. I took some headlight polish to remove the lettering from the gauge lens, and put some aerospace 303 protectant on it to make it clear and shiny again. I plan on beefing up the wiring and adding a better inline fuse holder as well.
B0015P0QPS|5|I thought &#34;How can one hand cleaner be THAT much better than another?&#34;  After all, I've tried most of them over the years, and most of them work *pretty* good.  None really stood out, so they must all be about the same.<br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />After reading all the reviews for this product, I decided to give it a shot.  This stuff WORKS.  My hands look as clean after using this as they did before I started the job.  I'm impressed.
B000VAXLCI|5|Took ten minutes to installed. Light went out. Gas mileage improved. 700+ miles. Still no service light. $70 cheaper than AutoZone or Advance auto
B001F15YC2|5|The shop that installed the lifts said they were high quality.  They worked very well the first trip with our 5th wheel trailer.  Very easy to inflate with stems mounted through rear bumper.
B00KASN7SY|5|Love this jacket! Fits perfectly.
B00YQEZIWQ|5|Work great looks great
B003ELXTBE|5|Excellent product. 1 of 3 we have purchased from this seller.  All have been as good or better than originals.
B00DJV19KM|4|Great price. Good quality hitch. The one complaint I have is that the backing plates that you have to fish through the frame were a bit too large to fit through the access hole. They say to grind out the hole in the frame and that just didn't sit well with me (I didn't want to leave raw metal or unprimed surfaces to rust out) so I ground down the backing plates to fit into the holes.<br /><br />Biggest tip: If you don't have a lot of patience just go to the local u-haul center and get your hitch there. This requires some forethought and a lot of fiddling.<br /><br />Tips:<br />You will need a grinder, tin snips and a dremel tool<br />Grind down the backing plates to fit the holes.<br />Use extra wire on the ends of the provided fishing wires, it just makes it easier, I used cat5 wire<br />DO NOT REMOVE the fish wires from the bolts until you ready to put the nuts on the bolts<br />Run the fish wire through the holes of the hitch and bolt the center of the hitch up to support it while you put the other bolts in outside brackets<br />Take your time cutting the heat shield and belly pan, you can make it look professional if you cut a little at a time and test fit it often<br />I am very handy with tools and it took me 4 hours.
B00DHK287I|5|Came on time and was in perfect shape and my ranger starts great now
B000JFL7ZS|5|This makes changing the fuel filter on my 2008 F250 a snap.
B00407WNE0|5|Great addition to daughters jeep.. Doesn't move a bit like others say theirs does..
B004AWDGMI|5|Purchased for my daughter - she loves them...
B008BVZMGW|5|Exactly what I needed and by far the best price!!
B00CJ680IM|4|Product came very fast and was described perfectly
B00802GIW4|5|HIDs are awesome. Perfect color for me. I haven't had any problems since installed. I love driving at night cause I love the way they illuminate the road. Thank you!
B00JBQR24Q|2|I was excited to find a replacement bottle AND pump at a great price...the bottle did not have the level indicator that my original has, and my old bottle was fine.  I installed the replacement pump, and it worked great, for about 3 days.  After that, it just squirted out a little water, then it quit all together within about a week.  Hopefully the new pump I bought somewhere else, which is supposed to be an OEM part will last as long as the original.  Regardless, google the video how to change this out, you will save yourself a lot of guess work.  It isn't a dificult installation, but be prepared to remove the front drivers tire, battery, battery platform, and wheel well cover when working on this.
B00DSK0L9O|4|Works well.
B000J15THO|5|Royal purple is all I use in my truck. Great fluid!
B008OTOQX6|5|This thing worked great.  It's exactly what you would expect and makes a high pitched somewhat irritating continuous sort of beep.  It's quite loud from my perspective.  I put it in my old car to beep when the turn signals flash and it was so loud I had to put tape over it and it's still really too loud.
B000C2ACTA|5|I bought this from another retailer.  I found the installation goes smoother in cold climates.  The product originally wasn't meant for my car but after a lot of elbow grease and some lube I was able to get it to snugly fit after a gentle back and forth motion in my car's engine compartment.  No more unintended liquid coming from my pump!
B001F0GH1U|5|Works perfect, and definately supports the motor, taking weight off the back of the boat. Great especially for bumpy roads.
B00FW1U5MA|1|it says 4 series but it does NOT Fit a 4 series!
B00042KJQ4|5|Great addition to the Hi-lift jack
B00NEL6HT0|5|WITH ITEMS WHOSE EFFECT IS INVISIBLE YOU CAN ONLY HOPE THEY ARE WORKING. I GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD, I HOPE IT'S GOOD  AND THEY CHARGE &#34;UPTHE KAZOO&#34; LIKE IT'S GOOD.
B002MQFTLU|1|Part worked fine, it just took way too long for shipping.
B00P9OF04I|5|Works as advertised. I really could not believe how well it worked.  I used a couple other brands that required more work and initial results weren't as good and they deteriorated quickly.  The cleaner works great. My lenses were pretty bad off and I cleaned each one 3 times.  I think the best thing is the sealer spray. There is a ton of the cleaner left, could do at least 5 more cars. Not as much sealer spray, probably do at least 2 more cars.  Now I will have to see how long it holds up.  By far the best initial results, Meguiar's is the best one I have used.
B007HS0PAI|5|A neat little display for the 92201 convertor, allows manual control if desired and continually shows status of charging.
B00752TRNW|4|It does what it should do.  Can not complain
B00OUM8GLY|5|We are very happy with the Skorch windshield sunshade we purchased. We received it promptly - 2 day shipping from Amazon.<br />It is very easy to use and is certainly effective in shielding  off the sun. It was easy to fold also. It has been put to good use daily.<br />Yes, it has been hot hot hot during the previous week. Temperature was in the 3 digits, heat index went up to 102-104 daily.<br />I would recommend this sunshield to all. Keep up the good products. Thanks.<br />Good luck to your business.
B000GG1IHC|5|Very good product wife had no problems installing price is rite!
B00APX2FBE|5|Perfect fit.  Probably best looking hitch if you didn't get the factory installed option.  Not an easy do it yourself job as you need a quality torque wrench to remove the tow hook and you need help holding the hitch when mounting.  If your JX35/QX60 is not brand new, you really need to clean the threads in the frame before mounting.  I couldn't get the hitch screws to go in until I thoroughly cleaned out the threads from 2 years of grime.
B00O0SRAAQ|5|just what i needed thanks.
B000WJGXD2|5|Excellent. Really set my bike apart!
B000OV31FQ|1|way to large to be used effectively
B000JFJLP6|5|Excellent.
B004FKM220|5|Purchased this to use as rail tape for my 12'6' racing SUP. Its amazing and the best rail tape I've ever come across. I love the 4 inch width and feel confident I'm protecting my board. Its already saved it from so much damage. I placed it on my board about 11months ago and its held up perfectly, no slippage or peeling. Its not coming off at all and I don't foresee any need to change it in the future. If there is a need to change it, or I get another board, I will be buying this again.
B00RWO6MYA|5|this light bar is very very bright and was a great addition to my 2 door JK. the only thing is you might have to buy bigger screws being that it is curved and most mounts on your windshield are made for straight light bars. also you might need to get some lock washers, rubber washers, or normal washers if you need longer screws to mount. other than that it was pretty easy to install and is definitely some eye candy for passing vehicles
B00ANPLLRS|3|got what I expected, no surprises
B0022UP452|3|I ordered the wrong thing.
B00X668ZFM|5|Nice covers. Looks just like the picture.
B000ALG8LO|5|I make knives and use this exclusively for attaching handles. It had never let me down. Best.Product.Ever.
B0052LQQFK|5|Bought this to ride from Ft Worth to Sturgis, total miles 2800.  This was recommended by Iron Butt competition,  lived up to the hype.  Stayed comfortable the whole way!!!  increased airflow kept bottom cooler, no numbness, no sore tailbone, won't ride without it now!
B001J7PC60|5|great.
B00VN962D6|4|Would have given 5 stars but it didn't come with hardware. Factory bolts don't work with these brackets. I plasti dipped them and they look great. I recommend for the price.
B0091OE6II|5|works and I need these so I'm not being strangled by my seatbelt
B000W0UZHG|1|I bought them for subarus and none of them work
B00M42DEVE|5|FITS GREAT ON MY 2015 TOYOTA TACOMA DOUBLE CAB , IT LOOKS AMAZING THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT .<br /><br />HERE ARE SOME PICTURES SO YOU ALL CAN SEE THEM .
B00UX1X3ZU|5|I bought this for my 2001 VW Jetta that didn't have a center console cover when I bought the car. The gray leather was a perfect match and it feels like it is really good quality. Nice soft leather, great to rest the elbow on. It can feel a little wobbly but only when the cover is pulled sideways, which is not something someone typically does when they open it. It also takes a pretty strong squeeze to open the latch without spinning the whole console around but nothing crazy. For $10 I'm very happy with my purchase. Fast shipping too! Thanks.
B00GSAUHB8|3|The little strap that holds it together is already torn and ready to fall off. The size is good but quality leaves something to be desired. Very compact which I did like.
B007FGR852|5|I put this on a 2010 harley iron. Mounts to the top of the headlight by the headlight adjustment bolt and the 2 screws on the headlight cap. I didn't use the screw that replaces the headlight adjustment bold and it seems to be fine. The 2 screws on the cap are plenty of tie down and the visor doesn't wobble or move at all. I usually wear googles, because of the wind drying my eyes with sunglasses, but this seems to break up the wind enough to wear sunglasses with no problems. Installation took a total of about 15 minutes and the product has a very self explanatory setup. I would recommend some Loctite though, since there isn't any lock washers that come with the product.
B00194CDEW|5|Nice quality. You need to order a size or 2 larger than what you normally wear.
B006P89I5O|5|Fab!  Did not see one at Sturgis??
B00062Z0FM|5|These are great I use them on my boat and motorcycles. But dont forget to take them off when your runing for I found you can run your engines with them on but it hinders the air flow causing lost of power and performance.
B005212WTO|3|Didn't realize it was a real sticker, but it's ok
B00407RZ6G|4|Dab hear; a dab there. Gets the job done.
B000WEPI4M|4|Fits my needs.
B00976L174|1|Will this fit a 2002 chrysler300?
B00HYYNW5K|4|what I was looking for
B00DUQKGIM|5|Worked awesome I should have bought it a while ago
B0040QTXVW|5|these cables are heavy duty. plenty or juice flows through to start large farm tractors!
B004QEJ624|4|Seems heavy enough for anything I would use it for
B001PRX7WK|4|After extensive research about different steering wheel knobs; this seemed to be the best choice for me. It did have some issue fitting onto my steering wheel, as I have a leather cover, so I had to find a bigger screw. But once tight, it hasn't loosened once, and it convenient for those tight maneuvers and parking. I would not recommend using the knob during driving speeds.
B003YJHZI4|5|The flip down support jacks on my camper are inadequate, thin material and prone to bending sideways under load. These aluminum jack stands are the perfect solution - lightweight, easily stowable, infinitely adjustable, strong and very affordable.
B00DKQ36T8|5|I have a 2005 mitsubishi lancer and I have been searching for so long for just the knob. It's a perfect fit. Thank you!!
B00LO0M918|5|Great Product, Great Price, Best for Less
B00OVBBSZ0|5|Do not come with instructions but don't need them. A chimp could install these! Easy to install. well-made,sturdy, look great and include all necessary hardware. Well-priced. Highly recommend.
B00TA7EN4S|4|Really a decent turbo for the money, I'm really impressed. I'm running a low comp built b16, previous set up was a Switzer s300. This is half the size, I want in full boost at a lower rpm, boost comes on @4500 and tapers off around 7k, but my engine revs to 8.5.. it's also water cooled which It like, both my previous set ups were water cooled as well.. I do think the hp output rating is a bit high. Lol.. 500hp rating at what level of boost... 30#'s.... I'm at 15#'s on pump marketing barely 350.
B00E9BF0QK|5|Item fit my 2015 Outlander great. Only caveat is instructions are for Oulander without power liftgate. To connect left side wiring it's easiet to just unbolt the liftgate power unit as connecter is directly behind it. Otherwise instructions are spot on.
B009S00IWS|5|good value, and style!
B00MT0NC1S|4|maybe they are smaller than I thought but they are cute
B00URUPSYQ|4|it was useful to keep most of the items in the truck bed but the holes are too big for light weight or small items.
B007WIBVAG|5|easy to install, fits perfect and looks great ! Good quality too!
B00HUVNMVQ|5|the shipping was faster and mor convenient than me traveling to my lawn parts dealer. The savings from dealer mark-up was a plus. Direct fit works great.
B00HZSNV4C|5|My husband is the one that used this product.  He said it worked great to get the bugs of the front of the RV. He also said one of the heater side vents had some black stuff on the outside and he said that also worked well.
B000CGRMD0|3|this not for my car, sorry
B00BCRMA9Y|5|Great product
B0090W7UL6|5|Perfect replacement.
B00GXRG7B0|5|Best on earth
B003B15KNW|5|worked great
B00IY3YLCI|5|I bought these lights and they came in two days when I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised they are solid aluminum very heavy excellent construction with big heat sinks and they come with nice hardware that lets you adjust the beam pretty much anywhere you need to send your lighting. Very bright you cant even look at them while they are on because it gives you spots in your eyes!!! Everyone s t work wants to know where I bought them,I have the flood ones mounted on my headache rack on my army truck that is my daily driver. I love these lights and Im ordering another set as soon as I write this. Buy 2 sets like I am!!!!!
B003072D6E|4|The quality of the leather is fine, the cloth along the edge started fraying on the first use but this does not impact the fnuction of the glove.
B00BA54ED8|4|worked very well, satisfied with the results.
B00OSA0TJK|5|What a brilliant product. It is perfectly tailored to fit the car and covers the complete windshield. The edges tuck around the windshield pillar trim and the head lining, which helps hold it in place.<br />I am so impressed I've ordered two more for other cars in the family.
B0012UI0JA|5|good part
B004IZTS2O|5|I recently did a clutch job on my 2006 Mini Cooper S.  This rear main seal is not listed as a part for the Mini but it works perfectly. Use patience and caution when installing it. So far so good.
B002P8VQ2Q|5|they were perfet for my baby black trams am
B00HZPXVG8|5|I'm very satisfied with the product and it was delivered quickly right to my doorstep.
B0009IK5O4|5|Went on easily. Works great.
B000FPYA06|5|Looks great very good quality easy installation
B00537LD1A|2|I bought some red ones first and they worked great.  I thought the green ones would be a better deal cause there were 100 of them, the red ones were more expensive.  Shame on me, the red ones are more expensive because they are thicker and you can bear down more on what you are scraping.  The green ones, when you put any pressure on them, the blades will fold up.  They kind of worked but mostly didn't work.
B00EKTJHCO|5|max mate its really nice thank you
B006YUICLY|5|Wonderfull product
B005MRFH0O|5|Have purchased a lot of lamin x in the past. Was a little worried these would be too dark on my e36. Got them on after buffing my headlights. These are a great compliment to the front end and keep the headlights looking crystal clear!
B000CSRA1M|5|Easy Install & works great!
B00CDR4QT4|5|Fit perfect. Looks great. Been on for a few months. No problems. Recommend to dress up your truck. I put on 2008 Ford F450 King Ranch.
B00COYNVPQ|4|Fits great
B00VJ4LHUS|4|Easy to install and not too big or bulky.  My only complaint is that the tissue box area is not big enough for a standard box of tissues, so I had to crush the Kleenex box to make it fit.  Not a big deal but thought I'd mention it.
B00BLAG3D6|4|It is extremely bright lights up the street  but it melted on my dash in the sun
B002PQW5B4|5|Look great.
B00XAX4B9A|5|fits perfectly in my windshield.  easy to manage and store
B000C91EWC|5|Easy install works great
B00MNT9Q3I|1|Second update. The seller refunded my money even though I could not return the item due to throwing out the packaging (it was a huge box, wasn't going to leave it lying around). Even though the cover is still junk at least I can say the seller is a stand up company. Would do business with them again, just not on this product. I may see if they have any other, better quality tonneau covers.   Update! I added pictures of the horrible fit and now it's broken also! This thing is a huge piece of garbage! The blocks that hold the rear locking leverl levers have broken away from the beam! Now it just flops around in the wind and can't be held down tight. The seller offered for me to return it but only in the original packaging so if you buy these piece of garbage you better hang on to the enormous box it comes in. They also asked me to take down my bad review. I have pictures proving its garbage! Avoid this cover beor you'll be as sorry as I am. Now I'm out $200 and have to buy another one because this one is broke at 2 weeks old!  Complete junk! Says it's for a 2014 Chevy silverado 6.5' bed but fits like complete crap! I have it at the edge at the very front but it barely reaches the tailgate. The real kicker is even though it barely reaches the tailgate in the middle it hangs over the rear corners on both sides! It looks horrible and is obviously a super generic &#34;one size fits all&#34; cover. Also the handles used to lock it down feel like VERY cheap plastic and are very rough feeling when clamping it down. I had a budget brand tonneau cover in the past and it was much higher quality than this cover. It fit like it was made for my old truck and the handles had a much more durable plastic feel to them and were very smooth when clamping down the cover. Unfortunately that brand cover is no longer made.  I highly recommend going with one of the slightly more expensive budget covers, I wish I had! This is truly a case &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  Another complaint is the cover doesn't even lay flat on the bed. When clamped down up front the rear sticks up 4-5 inches from the bed and you have to pull it down and latch it. It's either the frame is made incorrectly or the tarp is too short. Completely, all around unhappy with this cover! I'll probably be throwing it in the trash and ordering one of the many other budget covers that are only about $50 more.
B0051ULEWW|5|Thanks
B00OZYHOE2|5|I have tested the Tactic Point Cycle clear Windproof Motorcycle goggles<br />when we took a two hour ride on the Harley<br />the amazing change preventing air or bugs getting in my eyes<br />had me so excited<br />the quality of the goggles are superior and the case is of great quality also<br />when you ride a motorcycle the clear safe vision is priority<br />and this allowed me to have it<br />I recommend you stop looking and order this item<br />love love it
B00FY9ECLA|3|Not same color as picture
B009GKHXBO|1|Ball joint was not manufactured correctly, that it would not fit onto steering knuckle. It also was missing the pinch bolt that attaches the ball joint to steering knuckel.
B00H1IBKIK|5|Everything was great! Take it from me, cause I work for Amazon! Perfect order, great product.
B00CYL5TOA|5|Fits perfectly. I ordered all three sets. Front, back and cargo. Cargo and back mats fit great. Front mats are not fitting as well. Hoping anchoring them into the floor mat hooks help.  As usual, Weather Tech products are well made and perfect for country living.
B002JSM7HA|5|As a tool, it helps to insure that the difficult master cylinders are properly primed.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|I own a few of these now, they are a great size and draw very little current when the bike if off, works with every USB device I've tried so far
B000RH20T0|5|Great bag.
B001P2DP4A|5|Very bright have to change my headlights now there not as bright as my dog lights now
B00E1SNNGA|5|Great brakes great stopping power.
B0087PAKE6|4|Nice Lock pin.  very quick shipping.
B00CLFZ5BQ|2|It's cool looking but the sticky sheet on the back is really messy.
B0069T5HJ0|5|Fit perfectly!
B009996ZCU|5|Did  the  job.
B001PRX7WK|2|For the most part I liked the design and looks of this knob. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because both of the screws were stripped, I was able to get one out but the other snapped off.
B000BNS7Y2|4|Nice to know exact air pressure.  Purchased after comparing several pencil gauges which had over 10lbs variation between them.  Use for motorcycle tire pressure and also works great for low pressure  UTV tires (8-10lbs).  Only con is that it always seems to auto shut-off right when I'm on my third tire.
B011SPPXQQ|5|It really match highends design and looks awesome with my new corvette!!~~carbon fiber look!<br />If you want to find luxury air freshener, Definally recommend.
B00V2ZI5U4|1|It looks good on bike but has some machining issues. You will introduce unfiltered air in your engine with this intake if you dont apply silicone around all surfaces.
B003WOXOD6|5|Easy to set code and performed well. Stood up to the elements as we drove through many heavy storms
B00JIIZCM6|4|Works pretty well. Only complaint is that it does not have the most pleasant smell.
B000JROIXY|5|Made install a breeze and no wires were cut.
B00EFFUIQC|2|Received only 75% of purchase. The cans received were very damaged (dented) and many had spilled product on them.
B00L849490|2|The bulb was bigger than the plastic frame and didn't fit on my Camry 09
B00UNTU3VO|5|very good
B004J0YLSY|5|Just what we needed. So glad that we were able to order the radiator and install it ourselves. Save a lot of money!
B009KW82CC|1|Doesn't say maycom anywhere on the turbo
B00OB1DAQU|3|The nose piece worked for what I needed it to do, but ripped pretty quickly on several seems. I never could get the mirror covers to fit. I'd suggest just getting the nose piece if you only need to cover the front of your car for a short stretch of time.
B003FXSJMU|5|Gained a dramatic improvement on gas mileage
B0010GI5A0|5|Installed and worked perfect but still had security light on in equinox.  Wiggled the 2  wires on ignition switch while I had everything apart and cranked it up and now everything is functioning properly.  No more security light at all ever since.
B008M9WFDQ|5|Looks good heavy duty product. I put them on my jeep and put chevy wheels on it gives it a completely different look easy to install im with my purchase!
B000HBM6PE|5|Used it to patch rusted oil pan on my Ford diesel pickup.  Oil leak stopped.
B000JIDTRE|5|This is heavy duty.  Fits perfectly.  No modifications were needed.  Just bolt it on to the correct torque and you are done.
B002HUFVK0|5|Great cover. Wish the antenna hole was already there, tho. I cut a hole and put the seam protectors on, but since I had to kinda guess at where the hole should be, it is a little off once I put the cover on (my antenna isn't removable). Otherwise it is a good product and comes with a bag as well, didn't know that and was happy to see it did! Would have liked some kind of information as to how to use the cable and lock to secure it so it won't blow away or walk away with the help of someone who wants to take it.
B001LHVOVK|5|Good value for the price
B00G710Q6E|1|no mounting hardware..
B0013T7OL0|5|I. Already has one. That's why I  buy  3. More cuz i have 4 vehicles.
B002ZTIKF6|5|HAVE USED 2 SETS SO FAR 3 MORE DOORS TO GO
B0065S6S8Y|5|Worked great.
B0039H9LLK|5|their not weather tech but they work
B000IYTVUS|5|My old line just started leaking from rubber hose. This is a good price and very fast shipping(4 days to Toronto). It is a great product and is exactly the same as original one with looms. It is very easy to replace, just take time to go through(flexible rubber hose very helpful). It is a perfect fit in my 99 Malibu. You better lose the belt and take a idler pulley off to make more room so you can put 16mm wrench easily around pump side end fitting.
B00HWI5Q3O|4|Looks good and easy to install.  I just would of like to have a thir anchor support at the center of the bar.
B00062YAKI|5|Good price fast delivery
B001IAHWTS|5|2nd one different vehicle .Only negative website said would not fit 99 crown Vic but all my showed it would took the chance and it was a perfect fit
B006ZNLDAW|5|Fit great!
B007G4DK3W|4|I have owned one other pair of these bulbs on another 01 jeep xj, the first pair lasted about a year, just installed these a few weeks back we'll see how long they go for. They light the road up with the IPF headlamps I bought these for ,albeit they are pricey but they do a real good job
B001O12EZS|5|WORKED LIKE A CHARM FOR MY 2002 EXPLORER
B000IYUB34|5|Great brand. Great price. Would recommend both the product and the seller.
B00XAX4B9A|1|Very thin material and difficult to &#34;bend/fold&#34; when putting it away. When using in windshield-it does not fit well and wants to fall down.
B00DGYQ4UM|4|Didn't fit 2012 like I expected custom fit to fit.
B00O3LV3RG|5|Much sticker. Many satisfy.
B00T7GYDTC|5|Installed this on my golf cart and it works beautifully. Super bright.  Replaced the old 50w fog lights and saved 28w.
B008S9QUGI|5|Fit my 2011 Silverado perfect. Well worth the money. Very easy to install.
B00K7935KQ|4|Really dressed up the car.
B00AZOWSJM|5|Works great, was able to install it in less than 5 minutes.
B00NHX826Q|5|Fit perfectly. Cost less than the part from a dealer.
B00J1KFDNY|1|Dose not fit.Too short from Right to left.
B00VNJ4PEO|2|Looks cool, but REALLY bad reception!
B000CLSQBM|5|very nice perfect fit
B000CIT2YK|4|Fit is great quality looks good. Its not loud at all, was hoping for a little more rumble. Comes with all clamps and hangers line up perfect.
B0066CP6I2|3|It's really noisy and the lighter plug casing has opened up a little. Even at the lowest setting there is a very high pitched squeal, and at full blast the noise is deafening. I use it about 3 to 4 hours a day because the air conditioning in my truck just doesn't cut it. I look forward to winter so I won't be damaging my hearing with this fan.
B00ISJXBD8|1|The price seemed too good to be true.  After less than 3 months on my truck, both headlights are filled with moisture and look terrible.  Reached out to the seller and their only response was that the return time period had expired.  They won't stand behind their cheap, knockoff products, so you should just save your money - another online company has the genuine Ford Harley Davidson lights for under $400 (before shipping).
B005ZFBAQI|4|worked well
B004A0RDQ0|3|Fits, but is CONSIDERABLY smaller than the stock filter that goes on my 2013 Elantra. My Filter wrench (which I have used for dozens of changes prior to this purchase) does not fit on this filter because the filter housing is too small. Odd that the fitting and seal are the same size but the overall size of the filter is much smaller. This will most likely lead to earlier failure in use.
B001VKT9PK|5|Installed this into a Jeep JKUR, it was more than enough to cover the floor or the passenger compartment.  I am very happy with the amount of road noise that it has cut down.  Made a huge difference in the drivability over long distances.
B00HJVF25G|5|Satisfied...
B001LHVOVK|5|This is an invaluable device for any DIY car owner. Already saved me hundreds of dollars by pointing out easy to fix faults that without this device I'd be paying much more to have a garage to fix. I find that on both the BMW 328 (2010) and New Beetle (2003) you need to run the engine to pull the code, but aside from this anamoly this is a good little device. Paired with Google search this is mighty powerful pointing you on the road to addressing your Check Engine or Service Engine Soon light. I'd buy another in a minute. Price can't be beat.
B007TDPJPC|5|Love these. Easy to clean.
B001AY2WLU|2|Arrived early! Very small tool. I haven't used it yet. Appears too light weight to be useful.
B00J1KE7KY|5|Great
B00DJDF8ZM|1|I bought these for a 2013 C90. I had to remove the exhaust to gain access to the old links. When I tried to fit these Phoenix links, the holes are too small for the stock bolts to go through. I might try to drill these out a bit, but had to put my bike back together for now. Maybe I got a bad set. There is no contact information included for the company, or anywhere online that I can find. I wasted $60, new exhaust gaskets, and 2 hours of my time.
B0025272PW|5|Twice as much at the parts store.  Great product.
B013PNRXTO|5|Perfect! Shipped really fast, item exactly as described and very good quality. I'm really happy with my purchase.
B003V57NUQ|4|Like others have said, the instructions are lacking... but it wasn't difficult to figure out. Fits well on my 2000 Cherokee. Have used it several times and haven't had any issues. Wish it was a bit easier to remove since it isn't locked up there but its so cheap I'm willing to take the chance of someone stealing it.
B00KSDKWZ2|5|What an improvement, looks really good, and show good quality
B00ELASYIA|5|Item as described. It's a product you don;t want to have to use, but by feeling and looking at this product, it is great quality.
B00JRW175Y|1|Extremely cheap plastic. The skull broke off immediately upon light twisting/placement on the valve stem. Took over a month to arrive. Needless to say, very disappointed.
B000G1Y748|5|Great receiver. Fit on a 2006 KIA Sedona perfectly. Paired with the Curt Premium bike rack for 5 bikes. No complaints at all with Curt's products. All are heavy duty, well built, have a nice finish, and easy to install. Only complaint was with the rust build up on the pre drilled support bars and weld nuts on the Kia. It took me about 3 hours to install the hitch. It took about 2.5 hours to thoroughly clean and remove the rust without destroying the threads. Once installed it was rock solid.
B001D6GYLO|4|Does the job
B001DDQRBY|5|Thank you, and yes it arrived and is exactly what I needed.
B00CFBSNNI|5|Looks like a very good belt.
B008M22I0I|5|These fit my 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 perfectly!<br />It did take a day for them to flatten out completely on the edge from shipping but they cover the rear floor from door to door.<br />Very happy with this product.
B000OGH21K|4|Worked fine
B008OJ5H9I|5|Fair price and works as advertised.
B0033WNNR4|5|Good deal.
B007P7W35Q|5|better than the original.
B00G620ZVU|5|Excelent
B009YN2A7U|5|Nice looking and fit great. Ship on time
B003V9XYNW|5|Good stuff!
B001RPV1BY|5|Exact fit, worked flawlessly!
B010VUZL0M|1|I have a Honda civic and it didn't fit at all, It hangs off of the steering wheel plus it's frustrating when my husband turns the steering wheel. I'm not pleased with it so, i will be sending it back.
B007TYKX8Y|1|Product is poorly made this is my second one  The first one failed after two weeks the cable snapped and  now the mounting bolts snapped on the second one.
B00PJ2FAE0|5|Good
B00ANZW28U|2|It doesn't stay in my front windshield and it has been generally ineffective. The elastic band that keeps it together when folded broke after only a few uses. Not quality.
B001FM24J2|5|They do not list my 08 Mustang as compatible but this locking cap is a perfect fit. It also fit my 2006 Lincoln Mark LT. The dealer does not list a cap for either of these vehicles but it DOES fit. It would be nice if Ford actually knew what vehicles their assessors fit...
B001LMSKCQ|4|working fine  i had trouble matching orings finally put the old ones back in  would be nice if they included vehicle specific o rings
B000C9LZDU|5|Perfect OEM fit.  Working like a champ.
B002H9CMCQ|5|Yo!
B004BOH6BM|5|One of the easiest, cheapest and no-fuss ways to help rid your house of household odors. Our daughter's closet is in the most humid area of our house. With summer temperatures hitting at least 90 for 35 straight days this year she was starting to complain about how her closet smelled. It doesn't help that we've been making her and her brother wash their own clothes. She had an entire mesh laundry bag in her closet filled with wet towels and dirty sheets. She forgot them before going on vacation with my wife's family. Since neither sheets or towels are something she had to take on vacation with her, she left them there for two weeks. We ordered this Moso bag and put it in there. Washed the dirty sheets and towels, now the closet is back to smelling neutral. And here's another tip for these. My first experience with these bags was in my job. We had remodeled a house that was over 100 years old. This required cutting some of the walls out. A few days after opening those old walls up we noticed a musty smell and bought some of these 200g bags, mounted them to the bottom of the walls we left in place. It removed the smell and because of the hole in the 200g bag, the new owners can replace them in the future if they want.
B00P2RAMDG|4|Fits as expected. Fast shipping
B004KK553I|4|I really 💘 my new frame, however it's made of pretty cheap material and I don't  know how many car washes I have before the glitter falls off, it looks like it's a self adhesive sheet of paper with fake crystals glued onto it. When I first opened the package when it arrived, I noticed right away the glitter sheet was raised and not going to last long but as the old saying goes &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;! I just decided to keep and see how long it'll stay on, my advice to everyone is &#34;DON'T THRO YOUR OLD FRAME AWAY<br />👑 B€ BL€SS€D IND€€D !!!!!
B00LWDVKD0|4|It's a nice looking dash and not to bad to install.
B0002NIKGQ|5|Very nice
B00KLKVRNS|5|worked great,good fit ,no noise
B00JY5SQ3A|4|Much better than than those leaking EPA regulated cans.  I purchased five.  One had a broken vent tube.  Lucky I caught it before I added fuel.  Instead of calling a making a swap for one not defective, I welded the tube to its proper setting.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|Fob fit perfectly in the glove - just like from the factory
B002LLE1ME|1|Poor.. this product moved the steps about an inch in each direction then quit working all together. Had to ratchet strap my steps for weeks and when I went camping
B003PYYSMO|5|This is the fourth Covercraft Custom Fit Windshield Shade that we've purchased because they're so well made.  The Made-in-USA fit and construction is always excellent.  I will continue to recommend them to my friends and family and will buy more as we change vehicles over the years.
B00074Q29W|5|good swab bar
B00NODLUGI|4|Kind of tricky to thread the end through the clamp, but once you get it in there, these hold wonderfully.
B0040CTYAQ|4|great
B00PB6G9ZS|5|Pretty easy to use though I'd prefer bluetooth. Works well with Dash Command.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|I have tried the JAYCO TPG on one of my vehicles and I must say it works great. I like the fact that the tire pressure stays on the gauge until you release it with the side button.  I am going to take the pencil gauge out of this vehicle and replace it with the JAYCO. I have tried all types of tire pressure gauges, including digital ones that talk to you—the JAYCO is far superior to all. The gauge is easy to use and I will purchase another one for my truck. I like buying a great product from a small business.
B00C0SNKOI|4|Fades to quickly, but other than that perfect.
B002R4NFBS|5|Fits my son well, but doesn't fit my 18 inch neck
B00BTGSGFK|1|Don't waste your money on these things until they start making a better product. Now they've raised the price to nearly double what I paid less than a month ago.
B003NCBGMS|5|Ignore the negative reviews for not fitting the vehicle. It's your job to check the size and you can easily cross reference with the PIAA site (2016-PIAA-Wiper-Application-Guide.pdf).<br /><br />These are amazing. I was worried they wouldn't fit properly due to the thickness on refills. These are rear 6mm. They go to 8mm on the driver side and 6mm on the passenger.<br /><br />The 2015 Sorento (and pretty much anything out there) is an 11&#34;. I cut 1&#34; off the wider side and they fit perfect now. Clean amazing. If these even last a year they are worth it.
B00AWLO8A0|4|It is exactly like the original. The white plug you see in the picture is attached to a ft. + long cable that goes  down inside the body of the car. There is a large rubber plug attached to the cable. Pull the plug out of the body of the car. Pull the cable up out of the body( it was difficult because there is insulation stuffed in the hole)  It came up with a snap. This is worrying because if the plug comes apart it will be stuck down inside the body of the car.  Gently pull the plug to the hole, then work the plug through the hole. The white plug has a clip you depress to disconnect ( this was pretty easy). Then getting the plug and cable back in the hole wasn't that easy. You have to push straight down. But light has been working perfectly for about a month now. For the cost saving I think its well worth it. I would of given it 5 stars if it had some directions.
B00PSJ6ZUW|5|Nice lights
B00KTHZR7K|1|The key worked great for about 2 months.  Then It started having trouble unlocking the car, so we put in a new battery.  That worked for about a month, then we kept getting the message &#34;invalid key&#34; .  We ended up stranded after the July fireworks at midnight because the key stopped working completely.  Not to mention that the ER stowaway key kept falling out.  Will not buy again!
B00ZSBJ5U2|5|The deliver was prompt. Great sticker-solid Colorado that stand out.
B00E5G6BOY|5|Accolades to these two products.  Worked great and highly recommend.
B00BMULJWA|4|Just got it installed,  smaller than the original battery but you can make it fit with little effort,  put a small block of wood between the battery and the strap, the connections are different also but worked that out easily with a couple of screws, ATV srarted right up,  will update the review after I use it for a while
B000BYB1QM|5|Perfect. Right part and quick delivery. 1997 Pontiac Firebird, 6 cylinder.
B00PPTSS32|4|Good material, great adhesion, only complaint is the design is pixelated slightly.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|Discolored quickly, and it couldn't keep a good signal driving around. Save your money. Already put the factory one back on.
B00VVGU97Q|5|Works great
B00RCW02QQ|1|I ordered one and cut a hole in instrument panel of my boat.....did NOT work properly. Tested ok then went blank ordered another since the hole was cut and same problem....POS. I went to golf cart repair and they gave me another type meter and it works perfectly. I have requested an RMA #  TWICE to return the meter and NO response.

B0026MEGYQ|5|Outstanding
B001T9AREK|5|Worked exactly as described, very high quality unit.
B00318NQFY|4|Slightly better illumination than stock headlight bulbs. If these hold up over time comparable to the stock bulbs, these will be a worthwhile improvement price-wise.
B005SUWQ6I|5|Better than the factory one have no complaints
B000LQDMZI|5|VOLTAGE 12V-13V WHEN RECEIVED<br />HOPE IT'S FRESH OR NEW

B00JBI8NI8|3|They are just the same old &#34;Eagle Eyes&#34; with a different name. I hope these last longer than the ONE YEAR the other ones lasted !! They are a good fit !
B005CN5J24|5|This thing is kiiiiillllleeeeerrrr. I've been riding sport bikes for years and just recently switched over to adventure/enduro riding and this rig protects me on the street, but is lightweight and breathable enough for MILD woods riding. It's a little hot for technical, &#34;get stuck upside down on tree roots covered in mud&#34; type of riding, but thor offers gnarly MX chest protectors for that. Overall, this is an awesome product from a company that's been around pretty much forever...... Oh, by the way.. IT COMES WITH STICKERS who doesn't love stickers?
B005Q13BI6|1|Very short life.  Used in a ball machine and lasted only three weeks before it was totally unusable.  Duracell that I had in it before lasted nine months.
B000CPCG14|1|Theses are not for dodge stratus 05 they made my wheel come off
B00O4101NW|3|Wasn't as thick as I hoped but mounted easy and looks good
B0024E6ZW2|5|Perfect for stabilizing the steps on your travel trailer. Saves wear and tear on the steps and frame.
B009P0QGRM|1|Unit was delivered in non working order. It is being returned by UPS as we speak. I will update later.
B00042KGMG|5|Great jack. Exceeds expectations
B004HX1DZM|5|Great product
B00K5800BQ|5|Perfect fit
B004SG51LU|3|Works, but not a very good &#34;feel&#34; to the valve action which made it possible to apply too much pressure on the charging port schrader valves thereby damaging the springs on said valves necessitating replacement of the valve cores immediately after service work. When I wear out these I will get the genuine Robinair couplers.
B000Z7D1FO|5|It increased performance of engine combined with a cold air intake great response at the foot it really sounds good to. I would recommend it to everyone!!!!
B00K4UVUTG|5|Excelente

B0082OYG3I|5|Works awesome
B00HZSNV4C|5|Tried this stuff yesterday and it works amziingly well!!!  Just sparyed it on and left it wet by spraying it a few times for a few minutes and bugs wiped right off!!  Will definitely use this on my RV as well.  No more scrubbing those darn dried on bugs off.
B000F59VNC|2|Not powerful enough to do my hybrid car.  Keep it to charge cell phone in emergency.
B00JX05FYY|3|Works well but how am i supposed to get to the seat belt in center of backseats? You can buckle seat belt on either lateral sides, but your center seat has no access to seatbelt.
B00D29P5CO|2|It is very thin, does not sit snug so it moves a lot.
B00PG2QA1K|5|Arrived on time & well pkd.  Match my one chair & both footstool perfectly!  Good quality construction & great on my new patio.
