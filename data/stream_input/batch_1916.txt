B004TTMYQG|5.0|Tried the free cslendars but they all lacked something I needed.. This calendar had what i was looking for... widgets, recurring events, reliable reminder notifications.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is such an amazing show.  The acting, story lines, and historical period keep you engaged.  Can't wait for season 3 to start.
B009HELT3C|3.0|1 and 2 were much better, I liked the story line but Will failed to deliver. The excitement just wasn't there.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|I have played this before and was glad to see I can now get it on my Kindle!  Very addicting
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Such a great movie - and such a great question - where are the men that should be raising the next generation of good young men?  How many men have evaluated what message they are sending as fathers and made concentrated effort to raise their children in a humble, godly way?  Such a great movie by the makers of &#34;Fireproof&#34; - totally worth watching over and over.
1455523550|5.0|I loved it. This is one of his best books besides the Notebok. The Notebook will always be my all time favorite, but this one is right there next to it. It's a wonderful story, and not your typical love story. Nicholas Sparks adds a touch of suspense and danger and I loved everything about it. I now can't wait for the movie to come out in February, I just hope the movies gives the book justice.
B00932AA5G|3.0|Definitely entertaining but not the grandness proposed by some of the other reviews. Unexpected outcome, however, that made the movie pretty good.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|This is the best and biggest book I have ever seen . And if you what to buy it  cheaper here than ladygaga.com it is $50.00
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Didn't like the ending.  Wish she would have ended up with Gale!  Other than that it was great!  Excited for the movie!
B008D28HYS|5.0|With all the lame copycat games it's nice having an original that is entertaining and challenging. I recommend this game for people who like puzzle games.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was amazing! I could not put it down. I have no criticisms and I can not wait to read the rest of the series!
B005WUHAX8|3.0|This product is not waterproof as advertised.  When I tested in as directed before placing my phone in it, it leaked.
B002VL2PTU|5.0|Great performance but so unfortuate that it was his last. The Kind will always live in my heart and the hearts of the world
0345803507|5.0|book one is still the best.....but this book is for readers like me who love completion...reading from Christian's perspective in insightful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of nicholas sparks best books, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is very suspenseful and I can't wait until the movie come  out.
0345803493|5.0|The story just keeps getting better and better. It gives a little closure to book one and shed light to book three....the pages literally turn themselves
B000002GVZ|5.0|Carly Simon has made some wonderful music in her day.  She was the essence of the best music of her day.  Ilistened to Carley Simon since the early 1970's and wanted to add this CD to my library of music.  She and her music inspired my generation and I still feel she has been one of the best female entertainers in my life.  I recommend this CD to those who are of this era and want to aquire the sounds of our age.
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It is a great time waster before bed.  Puzzles are challenging but not too hard.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an excellent read. I enjoyed the two previous books in the series as well. I give it five stars.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I don't have time to wait for the weather on the news in the morn, much faster to get updates
B0058VW36U|5.0|My grandchildren love this game!  Actually I like to play it too.  Very entertaining.  I highly recommend it.  Warning:  the game may be addictive!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves this game.  We have it on the ipad and the kindle fire but she likes to play it on kindle since it is easier for her to hold.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when I started this game I was dissopointed by the lack of the fishing pole but then found 4 diamonds. on the first day.  also when I was mining I figured out that redstone was unharvestable.  one thing to note is there is no nether in this version.  you can not breed cows whith wheat.  you can not get seeds from Mellon slices.  dispite all of the problems in the game it still blew me away. good job mojanj :)
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I am not sure why but I am only able to see about 10 - 15 of the last status updates.  Works better with ipad
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is amazing! I've unlocked every item in Sensa Swag. Sorry if I spelt  that wrong. Anyway this app is amazing . No matter what anyone says I think this app is fun, entertaining, exciting, and full of facts about fruit!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Got through the book, but almost quit in the middle. Plot okay but far-fetched. Ridiculous dialogue (I \\"live you\\"; seriously? who says stuff like that?).
0380730405|3.0|I had to read this for Literature by Women in college.  It's frustrating to read because the main chracter doesn't havea name, plus she complains a lot. It doesn't get interesting til around the 17th chapter or later.  The end leaves you in suspense which is frustrating too.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The past few years have been a bonanza for Zep fans with the release of the Led Zeppelin DVD and the live concert CD compilation, \\"How The West Was Won\\".  \\"Celebration Day\\" is another triumph.  Instead of playing it safe, the band has created a new sound that is nothing like what we've heard before but yet is unmistakably Led Zeppelin.  I can understand why Robert Plant didn't want to go on tour with the band.  They nailed down their legacy with a single performance that holds up to anything they've done before while proving they still have a whole bunch of new tricks up their collective sleeves. There is simply nothing else to prove, and Robert has demonstrated over and over that he's just not interested in living in the past.  As for Jason Bonham, he is not his father but I don't see anyone else out there who'd be a better substitute.  For his sake, I'm sorry the band didn't carry on at least a little bit longer after the O2 concert.
0486417751|5.0|I had to read this for Lit by Women in college, but I have read it many times before.  This is Jane Austen's second novel, and her most famous.  It is a wonderful story. Everyone should read it!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Looks great! Now if Lucas would allow the original before all his 'changes' to come out on blu-ray we would have it made.
B0073SWASW|3.0|I had to read this book for Literature by Women class in College. Since it was Jane Austen's first novel, before Pride and Prejudice, it meanders and wanders and has too many characters. It's okay to read, just be prepared to spend extra time trying to keep the people straight.
B008SVFX96|5.0|A great rock album by an excellent guitarist.  Some heavy tracks like Burn The Candle Down, but also some nice ballads.  World is a lovey track to wind up the albumn.  Every Road Leads Home to You is a stand out track, nice sound, a rock feel and sing along lyrics.  Taking A chance On The Wind has some nice slide type guitar and an acoustic electric mix that works wee, also sing along lyrics.  Weathering the Storm is a nice ballad, nice lyrics.Seven Years Gone works well.  If you like Bon Jovi, or you've head some of Richie's previous solo work you'll enjoy this CD.
B005R32L66|5.0|I am very pleased with this app.  It allows you to see the person you're talking to in real time.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Loved it. It's my favorite show but I never got to see the first season. I can't wait to see more.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|My husband uses these all the time.  He loves the surround sound, and being able to talk to his buddies on Xbox wirelessly.  They are wonderful for me as well because we live in an apartment, and it allows me to do other things without having to listen to him playing Xbox.  Highly recommend!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to so many people simply because of the sheer, unadulterated joy of the nostalgia within it.  A cleverly spun plot with interesting characters only adds to the wonder of this novel.<br /><br />Not since reading Ender's Game have a finished a book and felt so giddy and excited.  The book takes off racing and the tension keeps picking up with new twists all the time.  A wonderful read even if you  don't know 1980's minutia, but if you do, the book is even more of a delight.
0307341577|4.0|I actually got to meet Gillian Flynn at a book signing and talk. She is a warm and friendly person with a wickedly dark imagination. I really enjoyed her style of writing and finished the book in two days being unable to put it down.  People who only know of this author through her bestseller \\"Gone Girl\\" should definitely consider reading this as well.
B000FC11JW|5.0|Very clear concepts with real examples that apply on any large corporation executive. A must read for anyone looking for self-development.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I enjoy Wes Anderson's creative filming and directing and that's evident here. Love the khaki scouts and Bill Murray's character; I wish he had more of a presence. I found the 12-year-old troubled tween lovers disturbing, though. And if you're an animal lover, warning: a dog is killed in one awful scene.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is refreshing to have a game that isn't overly concerned with just testing your reflexes but is truly challenging your mind. The presentation is impressive and it is an essential for anybody's game collection.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I like sci-fi/action/thriller, but this was a little to gritty/gruesome for me.  If you're watching with a family, you may want to pass.  However, cool ideas about time travel in the film, but I didn't finish it.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Great movie, and wonderful movie for kids and adults. Enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and still enjoy this movie whenever I watch it.
B009738XXM|3.0|I bought this album when it was on a $1.99 special.  Being that I liked two of the songs, I figured it wasn't that much of risk.  If you like the two hit songs, you'll probably like the rest of the songs, as they all pretty much sound right around the same.  In fact, if \\"Call Me Maybe\\" wasn't on the radio, I probably would not have thought it to be hit-worthy by the time I got to it while listening to the album.  Her vocals suggest she has a small range and does not know how to add infliction in her voice, and the music all sounds the same (similar drum and keyboard sounds throughout all the songs).<br /><br />The furthest breakway to the apparently cookie-cutter formula that Carly Rae Jepsen used was Good Time, which features Owl City in both music and vocals.  It sounds like Owl City was the one who wrote the song.  The only other song that breaks the standard model was Beautiful, the prerequisite ballad, which sounds like a lot of other ballads out there currently.<br /><br />Again, there is nothing bad about this album.  There is no song on here that I just had to skip because it was painful to my ears.  Other than the two hit songs, however, there really isn't anything that really stands out and screams \\"I'm the next hit song!!\\" either.  If you can get it on special like I did, it's alright to pick up.  Just don't pay full price for this one.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I am addicted to Homeland.  I love spy/espionage stories.  This series brings in the current  Middle East wars. It reminds me a little of the Manchurian Candidate with a modern twist.<br />I bought the first season on DVD as a gift for a friend who doesn't have Showtime.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My 14 year old watched this movie and thought it was great.  She loved the character who played Fat Amy.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This is my favorite TV series.  I have to buy the seasons on Blu Ray or DVD after they come out to try to force it on other people....
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is just like the Angry Bird game we know and love on our phones and tablets. There aren't games like this in stores that I could find and it was at a great price. There are a lot of small pieces that are a choking hazard if you have small children, or if you have children that don't keep their toys together, some pieces might go missing.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This blu-ray captures the behind-the-scene. Lots of fun and more understand about the whole story evolution. The tributes at the end are exceptionally fiscinating.
B001JU4S44|1.0|This is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I watched the whole thing and now have a head ache and feel just a little dumber for the experience.  Yes, it is that bad.
0679809015|3.0|Had no idea this book was so small (think deck of cards, approximately). The pictures are cute, but the flaps are hard to find.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This game is fun.  But since I am not a very good artist, I find it difficult to draw a decent picture with my finger.  I was much worse trying to play this on my samsung smartphone, since the screen was not large enough to see the whole word.  I would be nice if the screen would turn landscape for some pictures.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts so simple that you think it is too simple. before you know it your hooked. and even though it is essentially the same thing over and over it does what it intends. its an enjoyable time waster. have fun
B002N5N4M6|5.0|My wife purchased me the fifth season for Christmas. at which quinolone Amazon to see if other seasons were available finding one through four for less than $10 each I purchased all. this is definitely a sitcom that you can rewatch over and over because of the intricate dialogue that is been written and things will get on the second third time watching an episode did not get on the first Great Buy
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Most enjoyable. Loved the characters. Just different from most well written and thoughtful.<br />Can't wait for the next novel. well worth the read.
144471032X|5.0|If you follow the program, you are guaranteed to lose weight.  The most difficult phase will be Phase One - The Attack Phase.  This phase requires you to eat only lean proteins for &#34;x&#34; amount of days (depending on how much you have to lose).  During this phase, you also eat oat bran once a day to include fiber in your diet.  If you can get past this phase (only 1 to 7 days), you'll be very motivated to continue.  You will lose weight during these few days and therefore will want to keep going.  The phases that follow allow you to incorporate vegetables and complex carbs.
B0091REZMW|4.0|If only it wasn't limited to how much energy you had, or if there were as many freebies as there are on my laptop. Still a great way to waste time err, entertain myself!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous from beginning to end.  Will watch it again!  The acting was excellent and the scenery and costumes were beautiful.
0547884591|5.0|I needed another cookbook like I need the proverbial hole in the head, as I love to cook and have been collecting cookbooks for many years. This is so much more than a cookbook, however. While there are indeed lots of really excellent recipes and instructions, the author uses cooking as a metaphor for many other aspects of life. If there is ANYTHING you want to learn to do, not just cook, this book will help (and inspire)you. If you just want to make some food that is delicious and tastes like it took far more work than it did, this is the book for you, too. It's also just a darn entertaining read! I'm going to be giving lots of copies of this as gifts, especially to people who are hard to shop for. It works on so many different levels it comes as close to having \\"something for everyone\\" as you're likely to find.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Showed up right on time, in packaging - everything was just as described! Plenty of packing paper and nothing damaged.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was captured by this book from start to finish.  I love how the author took us on a journey of this couple from both perspectivies.  Going back and forth you seem to get a full picture of these two people and their marriage.  The best thing about this book it that you did not know what was going to come next.  I was in suspense, laughing out loud, and talking about this book for days!!  You will not be disappointed, from start to finish you never seem to know what will happen next.  The author does a wonderful job of keeping you on your toes!!!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|The trailer is probably more awesome than the actual movie. So much potential and all we get is the main character sitting around a farm house. Pointless.
0060755598|5.0|Is your business surviving but only because you are putting in crazy hours? Michael Gerber shows you what you are doing wrong and how to remedy the situation. A must read for every small business owner!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I was so happy to find it for such a great price and have watched in many time already.  Would definitely buy again!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book, I'm going to see if this author has any more books. I really did enjoy it, all the romance and breaking up, intriguing.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Not a single novel in the Halo franchise has surpassed the quality of The Fall of Reach. Eric Nylund wasn't afraid of making of showing the dark and dirty side of the Spartan program and it paid off by gripping readers from beginning to end. Well paced and intriguing, Fall of Reach is a must read for any Halo  or science fiction fan.
B0053TMP24|5.0|To those who like the piercy jackson series you will love this one take that from me i read them both
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great romance!<br />Had me on the  edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next.<br />Very recommended for a quick read!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The book was mostly about dating. It's not one of the best books. But it was a good book. And it was interesting
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My husband watched the 3-D version on his laptop. The clarity was great.  The effects kept him sounding off in a amazement every time an object seemed to jump out.  The scenery and  color is  fantastic. What a beautiful movie.  Could have done without using Gods name inappropriately.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I'm obsessed with Stephen kings books and stories, this one was great, grabbed your attention right away and held it tight throughout the entire story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked the first book but this one was even better. Doesn't happen often in a series where the books just keep getting better but it did here
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I ever read it had so much action,drama,and passion Suzanne Collins is a genius .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am not a very faithful reader. Mostly because I get attached to the main characters and need time to get over them\\". Another major reason is that it takes me a while to really get into a book. This one, however, is different. I was hooked from the first chapter. I read it in less than a day. I fell in love with Holder and Sky and their relationship and I didn't think it could get any better. But it did. There is an INCREDIBLE and complex twist that is so intriguing and unexpected I could not put my kindle down.
1439127700|5.0|Read an excerpt of this book and had to read the whole thing.  Enjoyed it immensely.  It is about a piece of our history that is little known.  I have always wondered how a President handles life after holding the most powerful office in our country.  The expereince and knowledge of these individuals are a source of information to a new President and our country that should not be wasted.  Well written and easy to read.<br /><br />I am however dissapointed in the printing of the hardcover edition.  The paper appears to be recycled, which I am all for, BUT the pages are cut at different widths making it difficult to turn the pages as well as making them susceptible to damage.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I love this movie just as much as my daughter does, she so glued to the TV when this is on!
B0091XRTTM|5.0|My kids loved the animation and the story line for this little movie. The whale scene, turning into girl scouts and more!
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|No not so much - Matt can do much better - Started out okay then went down hill. Keep looking.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Smaller than the motorola, low energy consumption. The connection with several speakers and cell phone is with out problems, battery last about 4 hours
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|For those who enjoyed Relic and others in this great series, Two Graves will not disappoint.<br />Well worth the cost for the hours of engaging entertainment.
B00009027K|5.0|I have had mixed results in buying some &#34;new - old&#34; records.  However, this Yes album, is pretty much perfect.<br /><br />Audio Quality:  5 stars<br />Vinyl Pressing Quality: 5 stars<br />Packaging: 5 stars.<br /><br />The only thing that would have made this even better is a digital download that is common on newer releases.  (Buy the Vinyl, get  a download of the same material for your portable devices, etc.)
B005V4X8JA|5.0|This album dates me. I was in college when I first heard CSN. It was an amazing album then but this recording made it even more amazing. You will hear things in the songs you have never heard before whether it was an instrument never noticed before or the clarity of the guitar playing. Most of all it is their voices. Their youth shines through. This is without question one of the top ten albums ever made - in my humble opinion. This recording (Gold Album) makes it even greater and does justice to a gem in the musical world. I have now gone on and purchased every single album Gold Album made and will continue to purchase them as they produce them just for the clarity of the music. It does not transfer to iTunes or condensed to an MP3 file. Here you have to actual play what is fast becoming like vinyl, the actual CD to hear everything these albums have to offer. Granted I play them on some high end equipment which makes this equipment sounds like nothing I have heard before as well. They are worth every penny plus some and you will see sold out editions of many of these albums now asking for double the price. And even that is a bargain since these are likely to go up in their asking price so consider them an investment. Even used ones sell for doulbe the original price. Do not hesitate to purchase any of them. Protect them from the spouse or kids who do not know how to take care CDs for they will scratch like any other. I lock mine in a safe!! They are that good. Thank you for this gem. I listen to this one all the time.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|Purchased items for a Christmas Gift for a fan of Whitney, so I did not get to listen to the sounds.  Received the item in great condition and in received it in the time that was estimated.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another great book from the master story teller, Nelson DeMille. I love the sardonic wit of the main character, John Corey, throughout the book...a believable story, wrapped in the latest political and historic revelations about this time period, make for a great read.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I really enjoy this app especially the touch features.Have has it on my phone but love having it on my Fire. I do wish it had a one step undo instead of it being 2 steps
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I really liked the book.  One of her best books! A really great read for readers of all ages! Great Story.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|The protagonist is more than a little bit \\"Mary Sue,\\" and if you have a basic understanding of forensics and chain of custody, you'll cringe more than a little bit. That said, it has a nice flow and it's cute, but if you like the having to put effort into trying to solve the mystery as you read, this probably isn't your cup of tea. The inclusion of the recipe is a really nice touch and that makes me want to read more from the author.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I probably chuckled twice, that's why I gave it too stars. If you like dry humor that will barely make you smile, this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I initially purchased &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; through Audible as an audio book.  While on the Audible web site I realized that I could simultaneously read and listen to the same book.  So I purchase &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; for my Kindle.  It's been a wonderful experience.  I can read the book on my Kindle or Kindle app and also listen to the same book at lunchtime as the audio version and the Kindle version are synchronized.  It's great!
0761169431|4.0|My son loves this and has been using it since he received it. Would definitely recommend to others with children in the 10 year old range.
1419707663|5.0|I purchased this gift set for my grand daughter for Christmas. She's read all the other &#34;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#34; books and really was excited to get these to add to her collection. She enjoys sharing the stories with me and I love that she does.
B000AQJPQE|1.0|Purchased this for my boys' bedroom. Drilled big holes in the ceiling to install it (I expect simple screw mounting would work if you had a beam to install into)and threaded the planets on the wires as per the instructions, but as soon as the rotating function is turned on, all the planets bump into each other, some fall off, the thing stops rotating and just makes a horrible grinding noise. I'm guessing we'll just have to use it as a static night light, without educational value.  The packaging suggested you can download the audio to go with this product from the site, but there's no mp3 download you can save onto your own device and play when required.  You have to have your computer on, internet on, be connected to Uncle Milton site, and play it like that, plus all the tracks need to be downloaded separately and played sequentially.  How is a child to get to sleep with all that to do?  In fact how many children or adults, would even want to be bothered with that even if they were not trying to get sleep? Ridiculous!  Altogether a big disappointment and time waster in terms of all the installation involved. Not recommended at all.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|I'm a Joss Whedon fan and that's why I watched the movie. Although I've enjoyed some comic book characters, these aren't among them. And the movie didn't make me fall in love with them.<br /><br />Okay action. Okay plot.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|the movie was funny but i think i would have found it more entertaining if i wasn't expecting to roll on the floor laughing.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I love the Bourne franchise but this is the weakest film among them. There aren't really any new insights. Jeremy Renner does a decent job with a thin plot.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|The movie was fine, but kept freezing every 20 min or so, the internet was reading at 30mb, so it wasn't our provider. I don't know what happened , but it was very frustrating to try and get through.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|The musical mashup is what makes this movie fun. The plot is okay. Not really a big Tom Cruise fan these days but he did a decent job in the movie. For once, I played a different character than he usually does.
B001EBWITA|5.0|I loved this movie, great action and mystery and so convenient on Amazon prime Instant Video, I highly recommend this video.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I love Veronica Mars! Watched the whole series on Netflix then wanted to own it. The writing is sharp and the characters are well-developed. The first season is the best.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I'd used this app on my Droid 2 phone for a couple of years and love it, but I downloaded it to my Android tablet and out of dozens of attempts it has actually loaded and run twice. I prefer the Weather Channel app to the other weather apps I've tried, but if it doesn't load it's useless.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|While the plot idea is interesting, the execution wasn't. The characters lack depth so it's hard to care about them one way or another. And the movie isn't self-contained. It's a set up for a sequel.<br /><br />The only thing of real interest in the movie is the way it ties into other Ridley Scott movies. I won't spoil it but be on the lookout for the teasers.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I love this app its very fun. and children. love. it my Toca boca is broken and I cant get into it.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I never saw the original Dark Shadows TV show so this story was all new to me. I like that Depp plays quirky characters and this movie has it's share. And watching Barnaby adjust to the modern world is somewhat entertaining. Otherwise the movie is just okay.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I purchased the disney princess peel & stick decals with gems, to up date and bling out a pink 6 volt battery ride on car for my niece. I put the gems on the hood of the car and around the license plate of the car and the some of the peel and stick princess' on the sides of the cars doors. The car came out great! everyone loved it, my niece loved it, and it is now a \\"one of a kind\\" car and the only one on her block.. The product is very easy to use and the stones really stick great. I also used this product on a wooden toy chest that sits in her play room 3 years ago, my sister loved that you can remove the stickers to change it up, when she get older and her taste change for different characters or themes,\\" VERY INPORTANT\\" clean the surface of the area that you will be applying the gems and characters make sure there is no dirt or oil residue use water to clean and dry really well.  Good Luck and have fun!
B00ARAO720|3.0|The bike riding is the star of this movie and there are some great chase scenes showing cool riding. If you want a movie with a good plot or character development, this isn't it. But if you want a 90 or so minutes of mindless fun, then this will do.
1576754227|5.0|This bool is awesome.  I started benefiting immediately from the tips.  Practical tips to be used by all ages!  Easy to apply.<br />My teenage daughter started using the tips as well and made huge changes with school work.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I love Batman but haven't been a fan of the movies. I especially disliked Christopher Nolan's &#34;Batman Begins&#34; and &#34;The Dark Knight.&#34; But oddly, I liked this movie and it's mostly because of Anne Hathaway.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is dark and while it tries to be complex, it comes across as bombastic instead. Batman has stumbled and when the movie starts, he's a hermit. And the movie's central theme is about him coming back to himself. But the movie takes great leaps on his way back. As much as I want to love Batman, Nolan's character continues to make me feel ho hum about him.<br /><br />The saving grace of the film is two things. One is Anne Hathaway. I'm usually indifferent to her in that I won't go out of my way to watch her films but won't avoid them either. For the first time, though, she became interesting. Her Catwoman is very dark and she hits the mark with her characterization, much to my surprise. She just might be the best Catwoman with a combination of flip, funny, and sexy. She's also has a hidden vulnerability that just peeks out on the film enough to let you know there's more to her.<br /><br />The second saving grace of the film is the expected ending. It has a great twist to it that caught me completely off-guard that I loved.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|After listening to the mellow voice of Sam Cooke, which I remember from AM radio as a child in the late 1950's, I can say he is one of the true forerunners of what we know as Soul Music. Songs like You Send Me, Chain Gang, Wonderful World, Cupid and others lead me to think of Al Green and his very mellow soulful ballads of the '70's. Cooke had too short of a life for us to appreciate his talents. I recommend The Best of Sam Cooke to those who those who enjoy suave, relaxing music. If you do, this collection should be a treat.
B009HELT3C|3.0|The best part of this movie is Josh Brolin. He is bang on sounding and acting like Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />As a third installment in the MIB franchise, the plotting is getting old. The aliens were great fun in the first movie, but by this one is all a bit oh hum. But still in all, if you want a big of fun escape, this is a decent choice if you like the other MIB movies.
B009VB97EY|3.0|This movie got a lot of attention, but I'm not sure why.  Channing Tatum's character was engaging and I was genuinely interested in his story.  However, the &#34;Kid&#34; was a jerk and I didn't find him interesting at all.<br /><br />I guess that many women went for the &#34;dance&#34; numbers, but I wasn't impressed.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|I think that I waited too long to read this book after all the hype.  It didn't hold me the way I expected it to.  However, still an excellent book.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|Zelma Hayyek portrayed frida so well, what a fabulous film. I have watched it twice already - caant wait to see it again.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|Good suspense story.  Read it quite quickly because I really wanted to know what happened.  I would recommend it to a friend.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Just saw the movie, loved an will go see it again tomorrow :) it's the best Bond, with a great storyline and Greta action an introduces two characters long known to Bond franchise... You won't need to guess who they are. I'm only hoping Craig does at least one more. Well be buying this when comes out!!! Go see it while still out in theaters as its well worth it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I became totally invested in these characters! I am looking forward to more from these characters (hint hint) and more from this author!!
1846556007|4.0|While its not the Snowman, it makes sense to read it. Filling gaps that are mentioned bout Harry's past in snowman an redbreast a bit...sorry only two have currently.. So can't comment on books haven't read. Bit slow reader, but does have humor
B005OCFHHK|5.0|great price for 8 movies. the plastic case is sturdy and the slip cover is nice. ive watched all 8 movies and had no problems with the quality of the blu-ray.
B006AN78XS|4.0|makes you want to go to Paris. love the history, Love to walk in the rain. Best choice to stay.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book and can't wait to start reading the rest of the saga and find out what happens next
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I really rate this product a 5 *... Very easy to scan the negatives and convert to digital images directly into the SD Card.<br />Image resoution is good.<br />No need of PC to operate<br />Great service by DB Tech...<br /><br />Very much satisfied about this product
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy this game because it can be easy or difficult.  It is a great way to pass the time when you have nothing else to do
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|the music is the kind you can't get out of your head the movie was great also excellent cast of singers
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am about half way through it.  With the holidays I haven't had much time to read.  I will finish it soon.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not been this taken with a book in a long time. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read books one and two in 48 hours. Absolutely wonderful. Can't wait to start on three but I have a life I need to get back to for a short bit haha..
B000FC1HQY|4.0|Poignant memoir with moving tributes of emigrant love and perspective for several countries in central Africa. A. Fuller writes beautifully without self pity or rose tinted filter when recording parental flaws. I gained as much insight for post-colonial Africa as I did for Fuller's experience as a white Anglo during these years. (Read her second memoir - &#34;Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness&#34; first, but found this book equally compelling.)
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Got this at a really good price through a website notice that it was $9.99.  I dont even think I have this in my collection of favorite vcs tapes.  Now I will have to find the time to sit down and watch all the extras!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|should be able to ex out adds after forts pop up so its dimmer in bed room Alain adds get in the way on settings screen makes a confusing set up at start. but options r nice would be better if it had its own volume control so if an alarm is set its not a problem to mute what u r playing and forget to turn up the volume.
B004GYY714|5.0|I enjoy the great variety of music and programs just like satellite radio without the outrageous fees and expensive additional equipment.
B000SI939S|4.0|For those who want to have a glimpse of the south, this is a &#34;steel magnolia&#34; story, enjoyable and moving
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished Hopeless on NYE and what a way to end the year. Loved Colleen's other two books so much....but I have to say that Hopeless by far is my most favorite book of 2012 and I read lots.  Wow, this book took my breath away, made my heart beat fast, made me cry so much, but also made me smile and laugh.  As a mom, the emotional roller coaster I took with Sky and Holder was overwhelming at times but I wouldn't have missed a second of it. Colleen, you are one utterly fantastic writer. Thank you ♥  Big hugs to Colleen for giving us an xtra Christmas present :) I totally loved Holder's POV chapter, I love him even more now, what a treat!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you haven't already been infected by this series YOU SHOULD SEE THIS!!! This season has some amazing twists and brings back a few old friends, and new foes!!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I really am completely satisfied with the product and with the attention given by you really that I have recommended my friends and well I hope to buy something and receive the same attention
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Amazing, and very timely and so soooo very realistic.  He's the best.  Love the intrigue, characters and twisty plot.  Love Jack Ryan Jr also known as John Kennedy Jr. to me.  ha ha
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I really am completely satisfied with the product and with the attention given by you really that I have recommended my friends and well I hope to buy something and receive the same attention
B007QPFGJW|5.0|The physical exertions were amazing. Our guy gets the award for plain ol doggedness, he would not give up. Gad I read it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Its taking me forever to get through it because i've been busy with other stuff but this series is great.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I loved this book, and it was (slightly) different then the other Riordan books, but it sort of followed the usual \\"some kids find out that they are extremely important, (usually something to do with gods) are supposed defeat the totally evil Lord of darkness/chaos, they don't think they can but they do it anyway\\" pattern. (If you haven't, read some other books by Riordan and see)
B0009XNUK0|4.0|If you are Micheal Jackson fan this one covers his biggest hits. Starting with the Jackson five until late 90's
0688158234|5.0|This is an inspiring book, I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about life in Africa and overcoming challenges
B005HSL626|5.0|My entire family enjoys playing this free version of Fruit Ninja! Actual play time is not interrupted by ads.  The advertisements do pop up as soon as each game completes.
B000008ERZ|5.0|Great album!!!!!! How this album didn't blow off the charts just boggles my mind. A hard to find album too!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a great way to pass the time and get a break from reading. Works great and has a lot of options. Ads are kind of a pain.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I just couldn't follow the story line. I was confused at least half of the time.  Joseph Gordon Leavitt was very good, however.
0375812024|5.0|Bought this for my preschool son who is obsessed with airplanes and all things that fly a year ago and continues to bring joy every time we read it together. We are huge Richard Scary fans.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|With a cast that includes Jack Nicholson and Glenn Close and Aliens! Directed by Tim Burton. A cult classic that we enjoy watching over and over.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I enjoyed the TV series so thought I'd read the book. Downloaded it on Kindle. Like the show, there is much violence, but Martin is a really good writer and the story is engrossing. It was very helpful to have seen the TV series first so that I could make sense out of the parade of characters. If you haven't seen the show, google a family tree so you can figure out who is who, as there are a LOT of characters to keep track of.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! Have sooo much fun with it and it keeps the mind going. The graphics and options are GREAT!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breath taking and romantic. I'd read it again in a heart beat! It surprised me over and over again amazing!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Comparing it with Arnold's movie, this ReKall movie was more plausible and easy to understand the plot. The action is great and the acting was very good. I enjoyed it as an action film and would recommend it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Have had it for a very long time and never disappointed by the service.<br />Spammers are sneaky and even with filters are unavoidable but easily dealt with
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Wow cant beat this one anywhere, great movie &#34;Blue ray&#34;  plus digital<br />and all for a wonderful price, I recommend anyone who wants to buy a good movie for a great price, this is the place to buy...<br /><br />Thank you<br />Happy Customer
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Outstanding!!!  Love this series and am waiting eagerly for the next installment.<br />Very skillful blending of politics, warfare, magic, fantasy and the unexpected.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Got this controller for my new PS3 cause it only comes with one, work great save a little bit of money<br />fast shipping, great place to buy...<br /><br />Thank you very much
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Wonderful!!!  A lush production that manages to be faithful to the books.  Read the books<br />before seeing the series (don't have HBO) on my Kindle.  Just started watching Season 2<br />and may have to get HBO for season 3.  Easily belongs in the leagues of the Tudors, the Borgias<br />and other high quality, addictive miniseries that one wishes would never end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a fantastic book.  The world that was created is so intricate and so vast.  The author plops you right into the character's mind with only a few sentences and you immediately feel like you are in their shoes.  This generates a caring for even the minor characters.<br />I found myself unable to put it down.  Having to do on, just to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.  I blame the author for not being able to sleep properly because I simply couldn't put it down.<br /><br />If you enjoy a dystopian setting in a wonderfully crafted world, then you must read this book.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Love this series.  The books (and HBO series) are totally addictive.  Beautifully written with a James Clavellian kind of twisting<br />weave of plots and subplots, intrigues and many unexpected turns of events.  Wish it would never end and I could keep reading of this world for many years to come, alas, I doubt it.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|One of my favourite parts of the older Bond movies was the spy tech.<br />The hard action is great, but the humour & gadets need to come back too.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This is the 2nd biggest Star Wars Lego set and well worth the price if you can get it on sale. It includes 24 Minifigs and has many play features. The build takes a while and is very enjoyable with some nice building tecneiques. Shipping was faster than estemated and arrived in perfect condition. Over all I'm very happy with this Lego set purchased through Amazon.com
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Worth watching once, but just leaves you hanging.<br />If this was the 1st of a series then it would be great.<br />Another example of story being sacrificed for special effects.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I started and finished in one day. The characters and storyline hooked me from the first pages.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What more can you say. The characters are funny, cute, & entertaining.<br />Game is simple enough for any age to enjoy.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|a fun game. interesting to play,,not fond of having to go back and starting over when you die...but worth trying
0439796644|4.0|This is the third book I've read by Michael Morpurgo but not my favorite. I found it enjoyable and entertaining (especially as performed, complete with various voices and accents, by Dan Stevens) but was bothered by several incidents that defied the odds to the extreme.  Obviously, it's a story about a horse (named Joey, rhymes with Zoey) that is forced to work on behalf of the war effort. A farmer buys the six-month-old colt at auction, works him for a couple of years, and then sells Joey to a cavalry officer near the start of WWII. Albert, the farmer's son, who becomes a teen just prior to the colt's arrival, cares for, trains, and (farm) works him until his sudden, surprise (to him) departure. Joey ends up in France where he becomes acquainted with (then befriends) a horse named Topthorn. The two suffer many hardships, especially when they are forced to become beasts of burden. They also encounter kindhearted horse-loving persons. About the time the reader starts to wonder how it's all going to end, things start to go south (in my mind) with several events that may cause discriminating readers to scratch their heads. In summary, except for a few odds-defying incidents, War Horse is entertaining read. As good or better: Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand, The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips by Michael Morpurgo and Private Peaceful by Michael Morpurgo.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|The movie was really good, but the picture pixelated 3 times during the showing and had a ghost for a few minutes near the end.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My husband and I started watching at the beginning of the second season (missed the entire first season).  Looking forward to watching it, then going back and seeing the second season again!
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Not a bad movie ,it has better 3 D effects than a lot of the recent 3 D releases .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good read much better than the movie,a lot more detailed information on the people I liked it cannot wait to read the rest of the books
B009GESJH2|4.0|Not the KId Rock we are used to ,It must be because of his age ( 40  ) good though
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ver good continuation. Must read whole trilogy! Good for young adults and up! Couldn't wait for each book to continue.
B008518MOW|4.0|It is not a bad Men in Black . I was a tad  disappointed with  the 3 D effects .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The trilogy is a must read! Can't wait to see the movie! Scary part is that it could all be possible!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I had all ready owned this on DVD ,when it went on sale as a Blu Ray ,I had to but it
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Love this book! So spiritual yet suspenseful! Definitely gives you appreciation for everyday life and all its amenities. I would recommend  this book to anyone.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This Product looks great when it comes to style, I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it doesnt stand up like its supposed to. Instead it just slides back down and won't stay up unless you put the rope around the bottom which in the description it states that you don't have to do that. O well doesn't really matter just something extra that you have to do to make it stay up but its still looks good. It looks like a book just setting on the desk.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was an intellegent and well written account of his experiences. Very interesting and well developed story. Whether you feel it is 'proof of heaven' is a personal matter.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is an incredible page-turner... an interesting look into an even more interesting marraige.  The characters were at once easy to like, hate and be baffeled by... highly recommend!
B007V4530A|4.0|TED talks are awesome!! The book -- not as much.  It is a good book for those who may never have had formal training.  It covers all the usual techniques.  The anecdotal format can be slow at times.  I was hoping for an ah-ha.  No ah-ha = only 4 stars.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|From the first movie through this one, each one was wonderful and could stand on its own.  As a complete set, it got even better.  I didn't read the books until after I'd seen all the movies and was pleasantly surprised how close the story was to the movie.  I also recommend buying the books to get more depth to the story
B000VWQUEC|1.0|#1 The story was not authorized by any member of Led Zeppelin.<br />#2 The songs in the DVD is not Led Zeppelin's.<br />#3 The songs in the DVD are horrible.<br />#4 I am so disappointed in this. It was my fault that I purchased this. I shouldn't blame the seller for my mistake.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Completely loved all the Twilight movies, but Breaking Dawn was my favorite - the wedding was wonderful!  It kept close to the books which I didn't read until right before seeing this movie and they did a really good job here bringing most of the points to the screen.
B004UOE7VA|3.0|I listened to a few of these tracks on pandora and thought that i was hooked. Unfortunately not all of the tracks are as good as the others. Hope you like it though.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I've always liked this movie because it's hillarious. Finally found it here for a good price and did not think twice when it came up as a suggestion when browsing through other funny movies. The movie condition was good and have no complaints.
B0017WCERM|2.0|When I purchased this item I was really looking forward to hearing some good Metallica in awesome sound quality, because hearing something on a brand new vinyl is like hearing it for the first time but I was extremely disappointed because right from the start the record would skip, I believe this to be a manufacturing error and not one of shipping or mishandling. I did not try to return it due to my schedule.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Good movie for the entire family. It's also very funny for adults and children. Really like the story line. Bought it in widescreen edition which makes it less intrusive when playing the movie with subtitles.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Arrived factory sealed and in perfect condition popped right into the PS3 and played without flaws. It was worth the money.
B001HN6918|5.0|It's a movie any family can enjoy together. There is no uncomfortable scenes like some disney movies. Funny movie and interesting film. Story line is easy to follow.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Arrived factory sealed and in perfect condition popped right into the PS3 and played without flaws. It was worth the money.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I have the other ice age movies and my kids love them. It's funny and very entertaining. Seat with the family and enjoy this movie.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Arrived factory sealed and in perfect condition popped right into the PS3 and played without flaws. It was worth the money.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This is a rehash of previous book with lots of pointless description and lame plot twist. The author is to full of himself.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Arrived factory sealed and in perfect condition popped right into the PS3 and played without flaws. It was worth the money.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Yes it was free..... go for the upgrade it is worth the buck to see the ending... great graphics and plot
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app so much I get to be faster and its cool I have it on my kindle and I'm going to have it when I get my new phone
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|its a good game....but....there is no way to earn money or peanuts.without having to buy it.which sucks because its a good game and I would like to have a big place but without money there is no way to get it:((((so be veryyy carefully with your money.also u have to pay to go out and find animals...then waste more on trying to capture them:/ but it is a very good and addicting game!;)
0060229357|5.0|I love this book because of the great memories it brings me.  I can read this to my child and the size is perfect as well as the story line and artwork.  Great memories!
B005LAIH9A|5.0|If you were graduating in 1999 then you know the American Pie friends and can relate to most of them in one way or another. This movie is hilarious and you find your self going &#34;oh my god , there at it again&#34; mind this is American Pie and not for a family night but my husband and I could not stop laughing and commenting on each character &#34; no Jim don't do that , and oh my god is that the Shermannater &#34; and No Stiffler No &#34; in the movie and it was nice to see the whole gang in this movie again .
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Dear Amazon,<br />I really wish you would rent for $1.  I feel ripped off even if I like the movie because I know how little it costs you to do this: witness REDBOX....
B00991TCOG|5.0|Great artist, beautiful violin mix we love how she mixes the dub step and violin, This is a breath of fresh air to listen to , work out to , jam with the kids or find that peaceful sound as well you hear a bit of celtic, hip hop, there are to many things to say about this artist you just have try it out for your self!! My daughter and I were hooked at the first time hearing her!!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I'm really disappointed in Grishsm.  This book is more a look into the random thoughts of a criminal than a page turner
0810989956|5.0|This is a great funny book for the 10 yr old highly recommended. It is cool that you get to write your own story in the back !
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I got this for a nursing home patient.  It was good quality and is provinding many hours of enjoyment for him and others in the facility..
B003TT2X72|5.0|i rated this 5 stars because i love this movie franchise and i got a good deal for the blue ray movie i needed to complete the set. it arrived faster than i thought it would which was also great.

B009UNH0EM|2.0|Most devices use a standard micro USB connector but this connector is unique and required so if you loose it, you must replace it. I've opted to get the charging case even though it is larger, it is easier to keep track of and uses a standard micro USB connector.
B004AKCME8|4.0|I read the Guardians of Ga'Hoole cause a friend recommended it to me. And fell in love with the story and the characters. Basically, it's about a Barn Owl (Tyto Alba) named Soren, he lived in a tall fir tree with his Mum, Da, Sister Eglantine, older brother Kludd, and their nest-maid snake Mrs.Plithiver. Soren was looking out of the hollow one night waiting for his parents to come back, and is shoved to the forest floor by his brother Kludd. Soren was captured and taken to St. Aggies, an academy for orphaned owls, where he meets Gylfie, a tiny Elf Owl. They meet Grimble, a Boreal Owl, who teaches the owlets to fly so they can escape. Then they meet Twilight, a Great Gray, and Digger a Burrowing Owl. And they work together to find a legendary tree known as the Great Ga'Hoole Tree to warn the Guardians of Ga'Hoole about a rising evil known as the Pure Ones. My favorite character has to be Nyroc (he hasn't appeared in the movie, YET.) or Coryn. I hate how they killed him off in the War of the Ember.<br /><br />The movie: It's almost like the book. I know they can't make it exactly like the book, due to copyright reasons, but they could've done better.<br /><br />Differences: In the movie, Soren and Kludd both fall out of the tree, and get captured, while in the book, Kludd pushes Soren out of the nest, and he captured. In the movie, Kludd and Soren are the same age. In the book, Kludd is older than Soren. In the movie the first High Tyto is revealed as a Greater Sooty Owl, when in the book the first High Tyto was never revealed, and it briefly mentions him. Kludd becomes full High Tyto until book six: The Burning. In the movie, the Pure Ones are St. Aggies, when in the book, St. Aggies, and the Pure Ones are two different organizations. In the movie, Soren and Gylfie meet Digger and Twilight at the same time, when in the book, the meet Twilight first, then Digger. In the movie, when they rescue Eglantine, she's still a barely fledged owlet. When in the book, when they rescue her, she's a fully fledged owl. Meaning she has all her adult feathers.rescue her, she's a fully fledged owl. Meaning she has all her adult feathers.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Action sequences were good but not enough of them. The ending was not very satisfying. Overall a good movie but lacking some of the zest from previous movies in the sequel.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I got this for my 3 yr old, and he's beginning to love it almost as much as I do. So much fun, clever, funny, with throwbacks to the classic Muppets.:)
B003WUYRGI|2.0|Has great district is very good for a rode trip when you are studying home work for your kid I will recall this to everyone who love to read New words
B008UFUOH6|5.0|I really loved this Christmas CD by Tracey Thorn<br />especially her version of the Joni Mitchell song River.<br />I will look forward to listening to it again next Christmas.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I don't know because I didn't read it yet  I would recommend it to every one over the age of 13
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez is a long lost gem.  His music inspiried South Africa and Australia.  Go to sugarman.org to learn more.  He has begun touring again to rave reviews and after being discovered in Detroit doing a layman's job.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have watched this movie every Christmas since it came out on DVD.  This year I bought the Bluray when it was on sale.  The improvement in picture quality was noticeable but not great.  If you can pick it up on sale, I would say it is worth it.  As for the film itself, what can I say that has not already been said?  It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen from cousin Eddie to Squirrel!, this movie never seems to get old.
B000056VJ7|5.0|If you like to rock, then this belongs in your library.  Phil Rizzuto may be the only complainer; but, that was just because he was originally unaware of the 'Dashboard Lights' meaning.  The rest of the album is awesome as well.
B004U52VPS|3.0|SUMMARY: Overall, somewhat disappointing given the quality I associate with the Angry Birds brand.<br /><br />So, I initially purchased this game for a 7-year old nephew of mine -- he enjoys the virtual game, and given the box says this product is suitable for \\"Ages 5+\\", I thought this would be a great buy and be fun not only for him but for other family members too.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, the game pieces are built nice enough, game has a decently good premise -- but as some other reviewers have alluded to, some of the cards (on level 1) were flat out tough if not impossible to built for an adult like me, let alone a rambunctious little boy. Be warned, some of these cards require a level of dexterity and patience that I imagine most little kids don't have.<br /><br />Once we got the blocks set up, we found the plastic launcher a challenge as well. My nephew had initial issues launching the birds (you have to use one hand to hold down the plastic launcher, the other to pull down and launch) and when it was my turn, I just had a lot of trouble hitting the blocks. The instructions say launch from a foot away, but when I did I always overshot or barely flung the bird 6 inches! Folks, some very exact hands and practice are needed to master this game.<br /><br />Finally, when it was time to pack up, the given packaging did no service in helping put everything back in the box. Normally, a board game's piece fit intuitively back into its given box -- it took my brother and I 15 minutes to find the places for everything in the specialized plastic, and we still had a bulge in the box. Talk about cream on the cake!<br /><br />Overall, just wish Roxio/whomever just would've paid more attention to this. This isn't a game that little kids can just plop down and play with as instructed; takes patience and guidance.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I chose this rating because I felt that the choice of the producers to have the vocal music recorded in &#34;real-time&#34; while the actos were actually acting out their scenes was very brave to do. I have been an actress and a vocalist on stage and in many performance venues for most of my life. People who complain about this vocal production not being up to the operatic performances of the Broadway productions have no appreciation for the very vulnerablitliy of basically performing &#34;live&#34; where stage sounds and atmospheric and climatalogical and environmental sounds can and will impact every single moment of the recordings. What was done was a miracle. Anne Hathaway in her starved, beaten, and raped, ill and devastated condition would NOT have a perfectly wonderful sounding voice, I know these things, I have suffered through trauma and illness myself while still performing and it does change the timbre and  your ability to vocalize. However, the depth of character and the growth in the voice precisely due to the things that are endured and suffered add exponentially to the depth and potency of the vocalists performance. I enjoyed the movie, I thought that these actor singers were a part of a courageous move to bring the realism of their own voices to the forefront. The delicate and ethereial  voices of Cozette as a child and as a budding and virtuous young woman and bride provided the perfect counterpoint to the darkness and pain of this time in history and help us to believe that hope springs anew for all of us! I look forward to purchasing more of the recordings from this movie and for the purchase of the movie when it comes out on DVD. I feel that the price was well worth it. We have been back to see the movie more than once all ready and I suspect that we will go back again!!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I don't understand all the fulsome praise for this book.  There was not a whole lot in the first 3/4ths of this book except painfully long descriptions of unfulfilled passion - yawn!  It was \\"all angst, all the time\\".
B006S039YU|5.0|A classic, looks so good in HD, worth the extra $.  just recently got rid of cable, these movie services help.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is excellent science fiction with new perspectives and nuance on the difficult issues (moral and temporal) surrounding time travel.  It's so smart that some (like me) will need to see it more than once to fully understand it.
B007SGM084|4.0|Interesting subject matter. It is rather drawn out by the third book,but worth a read for entertainment value.  Worth trying.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I'd always heard that hair was the most difficult thing to animate convincingly. Fluffy, curly hair would have to be the worst. It's not a problem any more, it seems. ANYTHING can be computer generated now!
0345536886|5.0|A very good read.  I have read every book that John Grisham has written and am looking forward to his next book.
B0086700CM|1.0|it dont work, no wonder it's free. i got a new tablet and this app doesnt work, how do you expect me to get coins when it doesnt tilt.its a waist of time. it worked on my old kindle fire,but it doesnt work on my new one.DONT BUY THIS APP THE OTHER CUSTOMERS DONT KNOW WHAT THEIR TALKING ABOUT
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The writing is good, and subject matter interesting.  The author is good at describing characters, although lacks subtlety.  I would recommend it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Honestly, I didn't think I would find a pair of headphones to replace my derelict MDR-V600's (now held together with much epoxy, super glue, and duct/electrical tape) but I have. The sound from these little babies (They're smaller than my previous headphones) is downright mind-blowing for their price. I honestly think other reviewers are right and that these shouls likely be 250-300$ headphones.<br /><br />The headphones themselves are circumaural, barely, and adjust easily to my head, even though I have a rather big head.The pressure from them rests evenly around my ears and presses only lightly on the lobes. After wearing them for 4 hours, they are still as comfortable as when I put them on.<br /><br />Speaking of those 4 hours, I've been putting these babies through their paces, and I'm amazed. Everything from Dubstep to Classical plays with beautiful quality, from deep, ear-throbbing bass to crystal-quality treble. The music is as clear as if I'm standing in front of the band/singer.<br /><br />All in all, outstanding 'phones, with sound as clear as polished crystal, for a price that won't shatter your glasses.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|When I was young, I played the game, I watched to movie so look many times and I started reading this book. But for some reason I stopped. Then.... I guessing 4 years later, I buy this book an  I'm instantly hooked on it :D. Awesome book to read whenever you want. I just love it sooo much! :) thank you lemony snicket for releasing such an awesome series of books (series of unfortunate events) ;)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|wow so epic I cant stop playing its so epic ever since I found. it I was like ahahahah Its<br />the best game ever
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book is cool I've seen the movie but it wasn't as good as the book.I would recommend this book to people who like to read.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I had seen most of this series on regular television and had to have it.  It is a superb rendering of Dickensian punch, grot and romance.  The acting is as superb as you would expect and the production values likewise.<br /><br />I will watch it at least once a year.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing book with a cliffhanger ending that is sure to satisfy. I would say The House of Hades is going to be one of the most anticipated books of 2013
B000F3UAFC|5.0|An apparently scarlet Helen Hunt and an ingenue Scarlett Johansson on the Amalfi coast in the Thirties surrounded by an ensemble cast and Oscar Wilde's aphorisms - it is based on Wilde's \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\".  Need one say more?  But yes, the cast, the cad, even the slightly wooden husband and the other expatriates are equally good.<br /><br />Worth watching many times.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was action packed it was the best book I have ever read I can't wait until the movie comes out
B00447L4JG|5.0|It came all wrapped up and it worked great. it's a good movie and I gave it as a gift.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was surprised I thought it would have been worse for a free book. I enjoyed it and was intrigued the whole time.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|CD is amazing like always and shipping was fast! Has the DVD and CD which is what I was looking for and all stores were sold out
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great preview - wish it was longer!! I can't wait for the real season 3 to start this weekend!!!!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|i came into this movie not knowing what to expect but i was blown away, all of the characters are likeable and their development is great and the story kept me interested with some awesome action scenes and not to mention the movie was funny
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Entertaining but when you think back on the plot, it seems to be mostly involving a couple of long, drawn-out chase scenes. Never the less, enjoyed it and Jeremy Renner was great.
B008N1V11U|5.0|WOW This game is awesome the graphics are amazing and the voices are spot on (unlike the amazing Spaceman) great game!!!<br />Hawkins b standardised Yuri w ;) displays ma h  so  s I and hi susbsnshwneuwkwhekahsnsuwksh e.  Needed words
B0095XPZBC|2.0|Let's get straight to the point:<br /><br />- I can live with paying again for something that I already got (Season 2 on DVD)<br />- I can live with paying a \\"high price\\" (I just bought the entire Seasons 1-7 of Voyager on DVD and it was cheaper than TNG-R S1+S2 together)<br />- I can live with pale, blurry planets in Season 2<br />- I can live with sometimes too grainy picture in some scenes<br /><br />But I can NOT live with weird Enterprise shots where the ship is jolted/crimped flying over a planet, as seen in \\"Loud as a Whisper\\". Enough is enough, this is SO quick and dirty and totally unworthy of this iconic series.<br /><br />I'm hoping for replacement disk(s), maybe included when buying Season 3?
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I found the story monotonous and very limited. The explicit sex scenes were quite well written, but became the norm after a few chapters.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Paul Simon and the band do an excellent job on the CD.<br />The recording is also exceptional.<br />I recommend it to all.
0765342294|5.0|Ender's story is engaging and gripping. I loved this book as a pre-teen, and I still love it in my mid-twenties. I don't re-read many books, but I think I read this one over 4 times. I bought it for my boyfriend as a gift, and he's absorbed.
B009DKCBM8|4.0|This is the Neil Young I want to listen to.<br />Music and recording are excellent.<br />I recommend it to any NY fan
B004RQVVGU|5.0|This set included a well-mastered copy of the title album and a bonus version of Ozzy Tribute Live.  Sound quality is excellent!
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Fun, Kind, Joyful and Clever.  A real &#34;Thank You&#34;.  Good clean family viewing - well, sort of - a little blue language, but the rest is the best!
B0049VZ222|5.0|The best show in television hands down. The story itself is phenomenal but when u add in the special effects it goes to a whole new level! Creative writing, great actors and zombies!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|It's was always on TV and I'd catch jut the tail end of it and could never remember the whole story. I'm so glad I purchased it. I've watched the whole thing several times. Great movie!
B004KAB5QO|4.0|I am a huge fan of supernatural books like Hill's The Woman in Black. That actually may be my all time favorite. Because I enjoyed her style in that book, I thought that I would give this one a try. It is a very quick read but it is not the most exciting story. I would recommend it because it is a creepy tale, but it's flat. It is something that I would re-tell around a camp fire, in less than 15 minutes. I would recommend it as a one-time read that I don't regret buying, but unfortunately, I doubt I would read it again.
B00005JGAF|5.0|This is a great album. And the quintessential Ramones album. The extra tracks on the digitally remastered version is also a nice bonus - especially since you get great versions of terrific songs such as &#34;Needles and Pins&#34;  and  &#34;It's A Long Way Back to Germany&#34;. I am not going to go on and on about the songs on this album. You should already know them, but if you do not know them and you do not know anything about this band then this is a good place to start - since many of their classics which helped define the band are included here.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I am very happy with what i got. It got to me very fast and it was in great shape.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|I confess I am a fan of the Wallander series by Mankell, and Sidetracked is the best yet and Classic of the detective mystery genre.  To respect those who haven't read it yet I won't give away the key plot clues nor climactic end sequence.<br /><br />Mankell portrays Wallander struggling with a number of facets of his life: as a father trying to keep up with his rapidly-growing-up-daughter; in a tentative relationship with a Latvian-based widow of a fellow policeman as he eventually comes to terms with his divorce; as a Swedish citizen who is frustrated and dismayed at some of the horrific crimes appearing in their society AND the confusing changes being introduced to the Swedish police; and of course as a realistically flawed detective who struggles to glue together the various clues of a sequence of deaths (along with other crimes they reveal) and how they relate to one another.<br /><br />As a parent of teen and tween girls, I was gripped and horrified by how the killer silently threatens Wallander himself and his daughter, and how easily he gets very close to them.<br /><br />I found the portrayal of the police profiler also struggling to get a grip on the killer to be an interesting antidote to the American TV view that serial killers are easily profiled: not so here!<br /><br />The ending was well-pieced together as the crescendo of activity built to the climax, which was more believable than the furious action ending to The Man Who Smiled.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great tale of a heroine who breaks from her ancestors expectations for her to write her own story. The animation is well done. However, by comparison to films such as &#34;The adventures of Tin-tin&#34; and &#34;Rango&#34; the animation is simply convetional.
B00A5052YE|5.0|Seriously, What a relief to hear some Alica Keys for a change from my industrial punk rock collection. Take off some stress and buy this album.
B006H5120E|5.0|I received the Titanic 3D Bluray Edition as a Christmas gift from my husband. I was so excited to have it, I opened it immediately!<br /><br />I half expected a booklet with details about the director, movie, etc. but unfortunately there wasn't. :(<br /><br />Instead, there was a sheet of paper with the code for the DIGITAL COPY DOWNLOAD. Also included was the 3D DISK ONE, 3D DISK TWO, the 2D BLURAY DISK and finally, the SPECIAL FEATURES DISK. I was pleasantly surprised to see a new documentary titled \\"The Final Word\\" by James Cameron that contained new details on the current conditions of the Titanic and concluded mysteries surrounding the disaster.<br /><br />I have yet to watch the 2D version of the film (obviously) but I must say the 3D was incredible! I do remember James Cameron stating that if he was to make Titanic in 3D, it would be of the BEST 3D quality. Bravo Mr. Cameron! He definately delivered!<br /><br />The picture and the sound is brilliant. I have seen this film MANY times and outside of the theatre, this was the first time I got nervous watching it! The sound of the water rushing in, the ship breaking into two and the 3D aspect adding the feeling of really standing there with Jack and Rose got my heart pounding!<br /><br />All around, this is a great buy/gift-especially on Amazon.com (19.99) and I truly LOVE IT!<br /><br />Keep in mind that to view the 3D version of the film (and any 3D film) you MUST first have a 3D TV and a 3D bluray player. Otherwise, the disk will not work.
031606792X|5.0|arrived on time and in perfect condition as promised.  ty much.  my son wanted this for his birthday and i'm glad i was able to get it for him thanks to you :)
B008AK8FHM|2.0|The story seemed choppy.  Too many scientific details, simply my personal slant.  I was looking for the strictly Christian perspective.  I believe his story, but it comes across as \\"New Age\\".
0375869026|5.0|This book should be read by every middle school child.  You will fall in love with Auggie, shed a few tears throughout the book and absolutely love the ending.  I don't read a lot of books but this was one I could hardly put down.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Fun game, love being able to use it with the Kindle Fire. Pretty easy to use<br />and it's possible to change from black or white player with the computer only<br />choice.
B005DZMNHA|5.0|Santo Spirito Blues is another one of Chris Rea's good works.<br />The music is typical of his good music. My husband and I really enjoyed listening to this CD and I am prepared to find more of his music.
B004R1VXYU|4.0|Ordered this CD based on the type of music, never actually heard of the group.  It is a good CD.  My 16 yr old daughter has swiped it and listens to it all the time.  A very nice surprise.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is essential for the soul and any dog lovers. Took me a bit to get into it but once I did I fell in love with enzo and didn't want it to end. Not many books invoke tears from me but this one did and it proves how powerful and true it's message is. Highly recommended!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This trilogy got here quick and it was a present for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book and series I have been following it since the beginning. Good read for all ages in my opinion
0307891372|5.0|I purchased this for my nephew, already owned one myself, this game is my favorite if all time, been playing it since October if 2011
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I really thought this game would be more interesting, but it just doesn't hold my attention.  I play for maybe 5 minutes and then I'm trying to find something more else to do.  It's probably more along the lines of a children's game, getting them to learn hand eye coordination.  I Wouldn't recommend.
B006ZE66P8|3.0|It was okay I mean the words were kind of small and that's all but it made it harder to read
B008MEM24S|5.0|We absolutely love Where's My Perry!! It really gets your brain working. Takes a lot more noggin power than flinging a bird into some swine. Plus, it's based around Perry the Platypus! What could be better?!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I like this app I give it 5stars but one thing is it needs more levels it is such a good spp I can't stop playing it
B001AIRUP4|5.0|THis is such a great Story! it is definitely a movie I would show children who understand the meaning of Christmas, before you confuse them.!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very fun game. There are no issues (I play it on kindle fire HD).<br />I recommend this game to anyone.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I'm a fan of almost all of the major stars in this one and know the locales well (Laguna Beach, Chula Vista). With that said, there's some less than stellar dialogue and a plot that never really takes hold.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is very fun (a little difficult) but it has a bunch of random ads<br />popping up in the middle of the game.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I couldn't say anything here that hasn't already been said (and probably bettter) about one of the great holiday films. I doubt I'll even bother queing up the colorized version though. Frank Capra was a real genius who knew what he was doing with black and white film and no technology could add to that.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game but the reason I only give it four stars is because all you do is chop<br />fruit for hours. There are different game modes like Zen, classic, or arcade.
0307408833|1.0|As other reviewers stated, this book is NOT gluten-free. Many recipes are indeed gluten-free, but others call for spelt flour (a form of gluten). On the cover it clearly states \\"Gluten-free\\" and this is not the case.<br /><br />Also, these recipes are not sugar-free, though the subtitle says \\"mostly sugar-free.\\" The recipes call for evaporated cane juice which is......sugar! If you buy a bag of organic sugar at Whole Foods, it says in fine print on the ingredients list \\"evaporated cane juice.\\" But ask any store clerk for evaporated cane juice, and they won't know what  you are talking about. It is plain, old organic sugar. I am baffled that the publishing company would allow such a misleading subtitle.<br /><br />I've tried several recipes and followed the directions precisely.  I own many, many gluten-free cookbooks and have years of experience cooking and baking gluten-free recipes. With these recipes, I ended up wasting a ton of expensive ingredients. Nothing turned out well.<br /><br />The photographs are pretty, but pretty photographs and celebrity endorsements shouldn't be the only strengths of a cookbook. Without workable recipes, it is pretty much worthless. I would donate to Good Will if this hadn't been a gift from a well-meaning family member. I was very disappointed and had expected much more!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great and perfect for all ages. There are ads that pop up during the game but you can choose to get rid of them. I recommend<br />this game to anyone.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This always takes me back to my childhood. I love this movie! Great kids adventure film. It has been fun watching it now with my four year old.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I don't know why this game does not work on your kindles, because it works perfectly on mine. Anyway, this game is great and is easier than<br />previous angry birds games.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am fixsated on this product. Always checking it out and the different pages on it. Very informative and accurate.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is really amazing if I had the whole series I swear I would only need them to live
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked this a lot, just wish it was the full game.they don't state it here, but you have to pay . to get the complete game.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book really has a lot of detail and you really feel like your in the book. For me I couldn't stop reading it. You see everything that is happening. You can picture his face and really feel him (Augest.) This book was one of the best books I've read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of My favorite books.Suzanne Collins is a great author and I love her as a person too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was good.<br />Best book ever.<br />It made me think about things I've never though about before. It was amazing
B004TFLYRA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book- I enjoy the Alex Rider books a lot!!! I wish Antony Horowitz would write more books! I think Scorpia Rising has been favourite Alex rider book
0307592731|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd like Wild. I imagined a memoir about a hippie chick hiker-- and it is, don't get me wrong-- and feeling like I wouldn't be able to connect with the author. I was very wrong about that. Cheryl Strayed addresses universal issues of self-discovery, the mother/child relationship, feelings of loss and abandonment and not ever quite belonging to anyone or anything. It's a beautifully written memoir that will stay with me into this new year. While I'll never be strapping on a backpack and hiking the PCT or any other trail, I can appreciate the need to take a spiritual walk and discover what's important to me.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Amazing and compelling insight into the life and mind of a true innovator of his time. While lengthy and a bit drawn out at times, it is a quick read and hard to put down. I would have given this book 5 stars but the ending was very abrupt and left me feeling very unfulfilled and wanting more. Despite its minor faults this is a must read for anyone interested in business, design, and management.  RIP Steve - you will be missed.
0345803485|1.0|Oh my, I am biting my lip cause I can't come up with a word that fits how bad the writing is in this book.  I will just have to ask my inner  goddess. I listened to it on cd and it was so slow i gave up before she signed the contract. Why drag it out if she does not sign there is no book.  This woman (girl) must have very low self esteem to even agree to someone taking over her will. The repetitive words just drove me crazy. It's amazing she never ever got a bladder infection from all the sex. Oh well this writer made a lot of money off of this book, won't be the first time we have been suckers.  I have to end now, i am going to be tied up and spanked and bitten by my billionaire husband wish me luck i only had two orgasms  today. OH MY, OH MY. Goodbye.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Very well written. The story line kept me engaged. I found it hard to put down. This is the second books I have read by David Baldacci and will definitely read more
0061801313|5.0|daughter loved it i dont want to write 18 more words, this is why I normally dont review. This is ridiculous
B0086700CM|3.0|This is the first game I downloaded on my Kindle because it was free.  It is okay for killing a few minutes of time, but I haven't gotten very far into the game and it gets a little frustrating because if you don't swipe the screen just right, you fall of the edge of the track and have to start over.
0061537969|5.0|I chose this book as the author has connections to Long Beach, CA, and I have a daughter who lives near there but I did not much care for the book.  I didn't much care for the subject matter but that is not to say it was not a good book.  It is just a personnal preference.<br /><br />My main issue with ordering books is whether or not they come in a reasonable time and this one did, probably within 10 days.
B000W44IZW|4.0|It was a gift a friend was looking for an could not find. I not only found several releases but the particular release she was looking for. It was the perfect gift and we enjoyed watching together. It is a movie to watch more than once.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|You get to draw your own stickman and then use different magic pencils to solve puzzles. My 8 yr old daughter and I both love this game because it is unlike any other game we have played.
B005K17RU0|5.0|App works great on my kindle fire. I don't understand why some people are so critical with free apps... reminder &quot;they are free!&quot; If you don't like them then don't use them!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|The guy is a real dick.  But it is probably realistic of the high testosterone kids who want to be a Seal.  We need these kids to do a dirty job but we certainly don't want them making any decisions in the military.
1401233791|5.0|Found it at a thrift store for 5 dollars give or take i read it and i enjoyed it. The art is nice the colors are vibrant and overall good story.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Kept my attention but had nothing to do with the Bourne series other than a few references.<br />Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon.
B002DJZJT8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie in the past.and I can't wait for my movie to get here so I can watch again without having to wait for it come on tv
0307594009|5.0|I first read Anne Frank's diary back in school (grammar? high school?).  A recent trip to Amsterdam and a tour of the Secret Annex prompted me to buy the book and read it again.  I'm still not finished with the book, but I'm enjoying every page of it.  Anne's insights at her young age are amazing.  And yes, there are the times the relative immaturity of a teenage girl still shows through, but that's reality.  At times, it is just overwhelming to consider what it was like for her, her parents and sister, and the other residents of the Annex, to be couped up inside for around 2 years.  Talk about &#34;cabin fever&#34; and getting on each others' nerves!<br /><br />There is just so much in this book, I can't begin to do it justice in describing.  I heartily recommend it to young and old.  We should never forget the evil that came against a people, or the lengths that others went to in order to help them at risk to their own safety and even lives.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|this was a fine guy flick, which is what I wanted. Pure hard charging escapism.<br />Not too original but well written in keeping w/ the anti hero against a corrupt system.<br />well acted too! Jeremy Renner was great and I'd watch Rachel Weisz read a phone book. It just so happens that she can act her tail off. So there ya go.BL Rocks!
B005DF2QMC|3.0|Those of us with loads of tapes really need players but, it seemed players were disappearing.  This one supplies the need but, is a low end player.  It does NOT come with plug-in power unit but, we purchased such at Radio Shack.  It also comes with a method for converting your tapes to MP3, a great idea but, instructions are confusing.<br /><br />However, we do use it.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I liked it and am glad they didn't make it a comedy, but there wasn't a single good guy in the whole movie.<br /><br />I wish it would have been a little less campy then it even was. They did a good job with supernatural.
B0085KGHOK|4.0|I am not a fan of Slipknot music. I like some of them songs. I like heavy metal and bought recently Iowa and Vol 3.<br />I am 54 years old (yes!) and listen to music since 1970.<br />I saw some years ago the DVD \\"Disasterpiece\\" and was impressed by the show.<br />I bought here in Brasil these Blu-ray last week, an it has an excellent video quality, but I don't know what to say about the sound. I think it is honest because of the kind of music Slipknot plays.<br />If I compare the sound with the Blu-ray of Jeff Beck (2008 Live at Scott) or Snakes and Arrows (Rush), of course the Slipknot has a confusion sound, but in the context of the show the sound  is good.<br />Too tell the true, the bass's sounds of  drums are very clear, but the guitars have a digital sound. The bass guitar I couldn't hear, it is lost in the wall of sound.<br />Too much energy and too much visual! Great guys !!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|These episodes explain a wonderful story in an exciting time period. you fall in love with the characters. It is great to have all the episodes together so you can have a marathon day. :-)
0345803485|1.0|Baldly written, boring, not engaging, insulting, I was not able to finish it. Can you say this is light porno?
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Thoughtful songs, great voice - nothing more to ask for. Thank goodness Ed Sheeran has made it to the US Airwaves.
B00571F26Y|4.0|It all makes sense. From a historical sense, it is understandable.  Our diets have radically changed over the last50+ years. Time for simplicity.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The twist was great, the emotion and passion were titillating. Great read!  Unpredictable,  hot, and steamy.  Will read this author again!
B00AE2J93I|2.0|Generally, the story was lame and predictable.  Definitely would be for children between 6 and 11 years old. A real time waster.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|a wonderful movie--it even held my husband s attention. we want to see more movies like this one in the future.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Clever, funny with some unexpected talent.  My husband enjoyed it also. Not a \\"chick-flick\\". Just a fun relaxing movie with some great music
B0063IH60K|4.0|except for the ads great love how you can customize everything the backs scoring dealing random deal winning deal great game will recommend
B006LSZECO|3.0|So many twist and turns! It will definitely keep you up wanting to read one more chapter over and over again! LOVE THIS BOOK! The author is absolutely brilliant!  BUT the ending is HORRIBLE
B009X011UQ|5.0|I love the color and it works well. I especially like the band that holds the cover on so it doesn't flap.
0385535147|3.0|Coming off his amazing novel, the Confession, I had high hopes for Grisham's The Racketeer. However, it just didn't deliver. It's missing that moment that just keeps you reading.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|A really great story but seems better suited for the Young Adult reader. Some of the dialogue between the teens stretched my imagination as young teens don't talk the way this writer imagines. However, I read this on a long international flight and it asked for just the right amount of concentration from me!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|PROMETHEUS showcases one of the most intriguing android performances, ever.  The amazing landscape and spaceship sets, impeccable design and sleek photography put you there!  However, the script is a bit uneven and illogical at times.  I can't help but think how great the conflict would have been, if the crew found the Engineer 40 minutes sooner and had to deal with the big lug, instead of having many members of the crew killed by their own stupidity.  When the Engineer awakes to the sight of the &#34;out of place humans&#34; in the nest of his bio-warfare/development facility, it should be pretty clear why he reacts the way he does.<br /><br />Your first screening may leave you with questions and &#34;what the hell?&#34; moments.  The best viewing is the 2nd viewing, in my opinion.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great story! Love the refreshing presentation of two totally flawed characters! I would recommend this &#34;who-dunnit&#34; for all who like a bit of suspense, full characterization, and a few good laughs thrown in!
B004SBULWE|1.0|This is not the app you want to use for the kindle Fire.  Download the other task killer with the red X.  Also free, more features.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|WAKING UP MARRIED is a fun read. Not too smutty. Lots of sexual tension, likable characters and a good storyline. This is a well written book with a good dab of humor which made for a delightful read. I liked it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|By far the best book I have ever read. It captivates you and at times it seems as if you are in the arena edging<br />them forward.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|My daughter ordered the gift set of all the films for my Christmas present.  These are the WORST films I have ever received via Amazon.  The last four films in the series are so grainy and so dark, they are impossible to see.  She would've been better off ordering all the films separately!  I am extremely disappointed with this product.  I am also disappointed that poor reviews of this product don't seem to be published on the Amazon website, but they are posted all over the internet in other places!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Product was received promptly. The quality of this adapter is high; its compact, lightweight design makes it nice for using on a laptop.<br /><br />This adapter was very easy to install, Windows 8 automatically installed the drivers, on Windows 7, I needed to use the provided driver CD. Either way it was a snap to install. One nice feature is that this is backward compatible with older USB standards, this was tested on both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 PCs, the only difference overall was the speed, USB 2.0 resulted in slightly lower transfer speeds.<br /><br />This adapter will be used mostly on my daughter's laptop, recently her internal network adapter failed and she constantly is on the Internet or streaming movies from our media server. She has a built-in Wi-Fi adapter, but often complains about the lag when streaming movies.<br /><br />This adapter would be perfect for someone who owns a laptop and has experienced a failure of the internal network card. Or someone who owns a tablet and needs a wired network connection for high-speed transfers.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone needing an affordable, reliable, and easy to install network adapter.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Came as promised, all 8 discs work wonderfully.  A little disappointed with the quality of the &#34;blu-ray&#34; on the first few movies, but I'm sure this is not a fault of the seller or group as these movies weren't originally shot for blu-ray.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Even with all the cheesy sayings and the though I felt the geographic references to Tempe were a little too much and some what off being a resident as well the book was all around good gave my mind the adventure I was hoping for and I am excited to continue reading this series.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its great and really entertaining!  I am addicted. I would recommend this to everyone! LOVE IT!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Twisted, eventful and unexpected...kept me reading and kept me on the edge of my seat. Would suggest for anyone looking for mystery,drama and unexpected book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a breath taking book and I definitely recommend it! It keeps you guessing up to the very end
0802473156|5.0|This book can help anyone who truly desires to make their marriage or relationship better. It gives a perspective of understanding which is not ordinarily considered. I found it enlightening and when applied, saw the results.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Another great read by Colleen Hoover, I've been a fan since Slammed and Point of Retreat. This is the only author that I've re-read her books since going electronic about 2 months ago.<br /><br />I can't wait for more work from her.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Incredible! Season 1+2.<br /><br />Has to be the best thing I've ever seen in TV and movies. Incredible body of work! Most creative work of ART! Fantastic in directing, acting, emotion, backstories, drama, photography, casting, editing, writing/dialog, plot, character development...everything!! Every episode is done like a movie, but with perfection! (See season 1 behind the scenes.) Maggie Q does her own stunts; she's expert in Marshall Arts. What's great is that these are real, serious grown-up people whom you can tell are true, loyal friends who love each other while they pursue a real, serious, worthwhile mission in life. It will make you laugh, make you cry, and sit on the edge of your seat. Look for the subtext.<br /><br />I don't think THE CW knows what they have here!
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|It was very funny and entertaining. I  enjoyed watching this and laughed out loud. I definitely do recommend watching this.
B001KQEE0U|5.0|I used to have this CD but long story short, I don't anymore. I bought this whole double album for dirt cheap! This should be in any Tupac fan's collection. This is a studio album and not a live one from a concert. This is the uncensored version as the title mentions.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This is a great movie we always enjoy watching as a family each year between Christmas and New Years. Many laughs!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Draw a stickman has great game mechanics, and provides a lot of fun and challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I really liked the ability to make your own character.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|some hands for lack of better wording, get very tricky they are fun and flow free makes the brain work
B003O86FMW|5.0|No adult should be as caught up in a YA novel as I am in this series.  At times predictable, but Collins succeeds in keeping it interesting.  Good writing, good plot, especially as a second in a series.  If The Hunger Games got your blood moving, this one will keep the circulation going.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great effects the 3D effects  exceed my expectations and my family really enjoyed  this movie. I have to see it more than once
0345803485|1.0|I wanted to read a steamy sexy intelligent novel with depth. Instead I was transported to the dream of a sexually frustrated teen girl who super duper loves Rihanna's S and M video and wanted to write a book about it. My daughter loves fan fiction, I have a feeling that this is what it's like.<br />And since when did Portland get so close to Seattle? And why is their a Vancouver University there? And why is she from Georgia with no country diction and they all speak British slang? Why not research? Why are you blushing SO MUCH I am OVER IT.<br />And I get it his eyes are grey, gray, dark, brooding ugh I wish I didn't pay 10.00 dollars for this!!! This is on the best sellers list the same reason why people eat Big Macs and why pop songs are number one on the charts. There's no literary value and the dull masses can understand every repetitive word. On to the next book!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Life in an English village as a vacancy (throught death) occurs on the local council. Seemingly unrelated people prove to be linked in unexpected ways, as the fabric of their community dissolves and then rebuilds
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I chose this book because I had read it before and remembered what an impact it had on me and wanted to read it (and many others) again before I pass on.  It is a good story, masterfully written but sad in places.  I would recommend that you read it at least once in your life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it! I could not put this book down! Can't wait to read the other books. A definite must read.
B000002AGN|5.0|Bought for myself.  Always wanted this album.  When Dave died just had to finally have it.  Gotta love this stuff.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It had me turning pages for 3 days, which is how long it took me to complete the novel. I personally connected to the feelings of Hannah baker, for I had once contemplated ending my life as well. My story will end differently, I sought out help before it was too late, unlike Hannah. This book deserves to have 30 stars, but I can only give it five unfortunately. :( Well, to sum my feelings on this novel up, let's just say you must read! You go Jay Asher! :)
B009POCFTG|5.0|Thank you mr.Thivanka Rukshan Perera for the fine review I'd subscrive 100% and to have reminded me about Cruising. I loved this Killer Joe movie as I was floored, admired and shaken by Cruising in my early teens, sensing it was different, a step unpredictably rawer and dirtier a story compared to the average Al Pacino film of the time. Here I had again the same spell. A great set of actors for a criminal sociopathological story, as a simple comedy, with theatrical brilliant and dry dialogues. Yes, bless you mr.Friedkin at 76. I wish me many films as this (as Bug; as Cruising; as To Live And Die in LA; as The French Connection or that first Exorcist.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was really good and I can't wait for another book to come out and people should really read this book
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|funny movie, a little crass but the humor is totally Seth McFarland. would definitely recommend this movie for grownups. funny
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A lot to chew on after reading this book.  Great characters. I think I will go for a run now..
B0085BHHOS|5.0|Es un producto que cualquier fan de Britney Spears debe tener, sobretodo porque hay canciones que solo conocemos los fans y que son muy buenas, que de seguro siempre quisimos que fueran tocadas por la Radio.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|Very Clever and captivating read.<br /> Read this in one as sitting.<br />I definitely feel inspired to live differently and minimally
B000099T2L|5.0|Its Beyonce so what else needs to be said? That girl will get you moving.  I put this album on when in the kitchen fixing dinner or cleaning up afterwards and the lively beats make the time spent speed by. If you're a Beyonce fan, this is a nice CD to add to your collection.
B007HACDLK|4.0|A little transparent but enjoyable none the less<br />Keeps you captivated and pursuing the solution to the mystery.<br />Plausible realistic plot.
B0067R0APK|4.0|For just the basic all round weather app this one is easy to use and easy to change and set locations!
0316228532|5.0|J.K.Rowling is a Brave & Noble Writer of Magnificent Books.Let us let literary critics establish the place that J.K.Rowling holds in The English Literature, after all it is their business, for the rest of us-can we imagine how our lives will be without the Harry Potter saga?<br />Casual Vacancy is utterly devoid of magical creatures of any kind, on the contrary, book's characters are shockingly real & to put it mildly pragmatic, trying to achieve their conflicting agendas with very unexpected results, however, overarching motive of compassion, responsibility & understanding so mightily present in all Books by J.K.Rowling I was privileged to read is very evident in The Casual Vacancy.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone needing to catch up or just wants to own all the episodes. Reasonable price. Streaming quality is good (this coming from a guy who's internet speed isn't the greatest). And I definitely recommend buying the TV Pass thing that Amazon offers. When buy it, you automatically own any new episode of that season that comes out.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Martin Scorsese is sometimes forgotten as a documentary film maker but in my opinion, he's still one of the best.
B0017HPHBM|5.0|Great product for any Batman fan. Especially if you love the Nolan universe of Batman. Idk if there are any of these left out there, but if there are, jump on it!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I enjoyed the humor. __a must read for those who live with a cat, and for those who would like to.:-)
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I caught this beautiful product on a HUGE SALE Amazon was having. So first, thank you, Amazon for the sale. Second, my mom is a huge fan of this movie and I gave it to her for Christmas and she was so happy. The contents in the box are perfect for any big fan of the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although slower than the other two, in my opinion, it is more than made up for in pure, raw emotion. I love the series, and especially this book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|i bought this for my son inlaw and he likes most of the songs. cant say for sure about all songs it was a gift.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|Our 11 year old loved this movie and her older siblings who watched it on a vhs tape when they were her age couldn't keep themselves from watching it with her and talking about how much they loved it when they were little and argued about who would watch it with her a third or forth time. Now I just need to figure out how to run it on the family TV so they can all watch it together.
B007HO392S|5.0|not her best cd but really like it and would recomend to any carrie underwood fan or any one that like country music.
1582701709|5.0|After I read it, I applied its teachings,  It makes total sense to me and my life is much improved.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I frequently lose time because I get so wrapped up in Spider!  No webs,  just lots of game!  Hope you enjoy it,  too!
1401308201|5.0|This is my favorite broadway show and to have the book on my table makes it easy to relive the night we went to see the show. God times! Great book!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a great series. We finished watching Season 2 last night and are hooked. Now we look forward to catching season 3 on TV. Only wish there were more shows during the seasons...
1594744769|5.0|Loved it. Didn't even know it was teen reading. Kept me rivited. Looking forward to another book by this author.
B007SZQXXI|5.0|Saw a recent ballet based on the Tempest and could not resist reading it again.  If you have not read Shakespeare as an adult please try.  Your life experience will fill in all of the spots that you did not understand in high school.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|this movie was what my son requested on his Christmas list.  He has enjoyed it. a a a a a
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I gave the book 4 stars based on the content.  I learned much about the life and times of the Yemen people and about Al Qaida.  A good tale well told.  However, I could do without the incessant wisecracking of the main character.  Enough already.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know if I can come up with words to sum up how awesome I thought this book was. Hopeless has an excellent story line with twists and turns along the way. Just when you think you have something figured out you are thrown through another loop. LOVE IT!<br /><br />If you are a fan of books like Slammed, Thoughtless, Beautiful Disaster or Easy... YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Can't go wrong with this Christmas classic starring Chevy Chase, Randy Quaide and a great cast of characters.  Since it's release it's been inspiring plenty of suburban families to deck out their houses with holiday lighting worthy of the Griswolds.  Provides that much needed chuckle prior to braving the holidays with extended family. &#34;Merry Christmas..Sh***trs Full&#34;!
B000FC1CYG|4.0|The social constraints placed upon English women at the time heightens the tension and  helplessness felt throughout the reading. Thankfully, Walter is not the invincible Knight in shining armour but a real man set against dangerous men. He must be tenacious and clever, aided by the brave female friend to save all and  claim justice. Old language for a fresh story.
B000YHG72E|4.0|My family and I never tire of watching this one several times during the Christmas season.  Will Ferrell at his silly best!
B003O86FMW|4.0|From page one I was completely engaged!  Can't wait to get the next book!  Hoping our heroine gets a happy ending!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|i like batman movie for 15 year this one is best movie for make in 2012<br />this one is keep
630529142X|3.0|My husband loves this film.  I had ordered it for my grandson, but later found out that he had the dvd .  It arrived on time for Christmas in great condition.  We are very pleased with our orders from Amazon.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I've played a lot of different computer Mahjong games, and this one is up there with the best. Great graphics for a free game. Very easy to jump right in and start playing.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is such a Fun easy game to play, especially for being that's right FREE !!!  I'm such a Fruit Ninja !! lol
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The only possible negative to this soundtrack is that it doesn't include ALL the music/songs from the film! As is, it's wonderful. Love the movie, you'll love the music. Add more songs, and you're just piling on the awesome! (I vote for 'Do You Hear The People Sing?', pretty please!) Excellent, amazing, all-glowing review here! :)
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I wish there were 20 Brandom Sandersons. Something like this could be awesome as a series. Even being really short, it was still worth the money and the time. Well done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. I am well on my way to read the Bible in a year. It reminds me everyday if I haven't done it yet. Love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very addicting!! I play it everyday on kindle and ipad. I haven't had any problems so far.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Just go to your photos, you'll find a camera button in the top right corner. There is a free one: it's just the most basic camera with no settings or camcorder ... that's where this app comes into play. It works just as the description says.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a classic book which outlines the incredible story of Pi in his eventful journey from India to North America. Hard to put down once you start.
B007JVJ3C4|5.0|Son, loved the 3D effects and liked it better than the first movie. It has alot of action in it.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I have the original Kindle Fire and purchased a Marware Leather Case similar to this one.  When ordering this one I was expecting something similar.  The thing that stood out to me on this one was the rotating section and how the Fire stays in the case instead of having to pop it out on the older version -- my wife never was able to figure that out.<br /><br />I received it today and found this product to be not as good as the last version.  Out of the box and installation of the HD Fire into it wasn't as easy as the previous version.  When trying to pop it into the holder it took several attempts to get it in.  Once in it was secure.  Starting to use it I found that I really liked the rotation and stand function; however, I was a bit annoyed that if you are not careful the HD Fire can swing out pretty easily if you aren't careful.  Also, the instant on doesn't seem to always work right, but I'll have to keep an eye on it. Also, it is noticeably bulkier than the original version.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'd say I am happy to an extent, but not a 5 star. Expected this to be equal to the last in quality, and I don't think it is.<br /><br />Update 1:<br /><br />I changed my review from a 3 star to a 2 star. The auto on feature when you open the cover does not work as advertised.  It seems that it only works dependent on the orientation of the HD Fire.  I am considering returning it.<br /><br />Update 2:<br /><br />I ended up returning the cover to Amazon.  It was outside of the normal returns policy; however, Amazon did refund a good portion of the amount paid.
B00936A0RU|5.0|My boyfriend and I went acc's saw this movie in the theater and both loved it, so I bought it for him for Christmas... we've watched it again and I'm sure it will be getting quite a few more views.  Lots of action, lots of drama, awesome cars, great story line. Definitely recommend.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|A man (Bill Murray) who is destined to relive a single day over and over and over again.<br />While he is focusing on him self, he just can't win....at ANYTHING.<br />It takes him some time to get things together and finally start living. (He finally adds some value to others on his journey of self discovery.)<br />Won't spoil the movie for those who havent seen it, but it is a Murray classic (see What About Bob if this is up your alley).<br />It is sort of a redemption movie of a man who finally sees what is valuable and finds love while he is at it.<br />I must have watched this movie 20+ times and havent gotten fed up with it.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|A love story featuring 12 year olds.  Kinda seemed like it was written by 12 year olds.  Very nice cinematography though, and a fun cast.
0802473156|5.0|The Five Love Languages is a very good book for married couples. The book's thesis is that there are five ways (languages)in which we experience love. My way is different than my husband's. It will help any marriage if this is read and learned and applied.I have recommended this book to clients in my clinical social work practice and they have found it valuable. One of the most difficult things for couples to learn is that their personalities and views are  not alike. They need to see things from the other's point of view in order to understand each other.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I love pinball games.  This one is really easy to use and understand.  I wish there were more tables to choose from though.
0316228532|3.0|I know this is not Harry Potter and I didn't come in with those expectations. However, I found this book very tedious. It tried to be too much instead of just focusing on telling a good story. By the time the election rolls around, I could care less about it and even more about the characters. It's an okay read, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really like J.K. Rowling.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think Angry Birds Free is great!  I play it both on my Kindle and online on Facebook too.  It is lots of fun!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game!  I love that you have to think about cause/effect in order to feed the little green guy -- and that you get to keep trying to improve your score until you get it right.  The sound effects are cute.  This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games.  Great bargain at $.99 with all the levels.  So much fun!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I purchased this product recently so that I could take pictures of my grandchildren during the holidays to try it out.  It really works well once you get used to the way you need to hold the Kindle in order to focus on what you are trying to take a picture of (other than yourself).
B007N9FKCY|3.0|My 12-year-old son has more fun with this game than I do.  I seem to have a lot more difficulty moving/controlling Bean around on the screen, so it takes me multiple tries to accomplish tasks.  I haven't tried changing all of the settings yet, so maybe another setting would work better for me.  Otherwise, I think it's a fun game.  My son really enjoys it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great Mahjong game.  I have played and played it, and might even consider paying for the complete version.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My son and I both enjoy playing with this program.  If we are out and about somewhere and get stuck (the mechanic, in line somewhere, etc.) we can color, paint, draw, use stickers or whatever, all without hauling a backpack full of supplies.  It is a fantastic tool that lets us use our imaginations.  And I like that you use your fingers (or a stylus I suppose) and not a mouse.  Everyone should get this app!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a totally mindless game, and I LOVE IT!  You can play as long as you want and just enjoy the fast pace.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  I could play this for hours.  I have always been a fan of match-3 games, but I don't know why I like this one so much more than the others.  I like the graphics, the sounds, and I like building the fish tank.  My son also really enjoys this game.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I love Munch Time!  It is a lot of fun and really causes you to think of the resolution to each puzzle.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|After watching this, you wish they toured one more time.<br />For anyone thinking of starting a band, I would recommend<br />watching this video. Inspirational!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great solitaire app when you are looking to play a fairly easy and quick game on the run.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|We got into &#34;Fringe&#34; in the later years and were wondering how it all started. The 1st year has given us a new understanding of this seemingly STRANGE show. We have only watched a couple of the shows so far, but have enjoyed them very much.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The Facebook app works well.  It was a bit confusing at first, but I got used to it the more I used it.
1423124960|4.0|My daughter loves to snuggle up with a book before she goes to bed.  This one is just perfect for her.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I had a problem with using this program once I downloaded it because I could not access it properly.  I deleted it from my Kindle.  Perhaps if I download it again it will work.  I will have to try it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book ! Can't wait to read the rest ! A very fast read. Would recommend to anyone to read this series !
B009MCRHH6|3.0|Decent but frustrating. It's often a cluster#@!* of the balls of goo doing $%&amp;* I don't want them to do.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|I love the European settings for the film.  The action and twisted plat kept you guessing, not to mention how well Johnny Depp performed.  Would recommend to anyone.
B000005HFH|5.0|As the title implies, this is the Best of Chet Baker Sings.  You should have it if you like him.
B001NFNFNA|5.0|Did not know anything about this movie, but it was an eye opener of how corrupt government was and can still be today.  gave a 5 star due to the factual content and the acting.  I would definitely recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful writing full of vivid detail, engrossing plot, and characters to root for.  I read the series straight though because I just couldn't, put it down.  I would love to read more on the two silos: the characters evolution, the rebuilding of the silo after the uprising, contact with the other silos,  rebuilding/ repopulating silo 17, and much more.  Thank you to the author and I will keep spread the word of you as my favorite author and series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best Bible app available. I love it! very easy to use. its helpful. very organized. its great at reminding you to read it daily.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|It starts a bit slow, but once the setting and characters are established the story really takes off. I found it difficult to put down.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|A friend recommended this series to me, and while I think the first book is the weakest of the six, they are all wonderful!  I enjoyed these almost as much as the Harry Potter novels, and those are my favorite books of all time, so that's saying something.  Anyone who reads these should be enchanted.  Each one is better than the next.
0375851569|5.0|As a special needs teacher, Dr. Suess is one of my favorites to get kids hooked on reading.  This set is what I buy for each of my nieces and nephews for their 1st Christmas and then I add another Dr. Suess book each year. My own grown kids still remember each one and can quote them from memory. I always recommend Dr. Suess and this is a great collection of the beginning  books!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I continue to rent and rewatch this movie... It's so good. I can't wait until the new movie comes out.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Great game- I'm a warcraft fan, and this is like having that on the go. Runs smoothly on my kindle fire. No complaints so far.
B002QEXT4W|4.0|Starting off with \\"Is it on Tommy?\\"  Nothing but the Truth!  The cover is beautiful and some nice tunes here with only a couple of duds, which is very good.  The best w/o Robin Trower lead guitarist extraordinaire!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I've read all of Vince Flynn's novels featuring Rabb and this is a good continuation of the charactor.  Flynn gives substance to all his charactors anf makes you like or hate them.  Any Flynn reader should get this.
0312427999|1.0|I'm a Democrat and even I'll admit this book is TERRIBLE and the most STUPIDEST book I have ever read! This author has quite the imagination.<br /><br />The author Naomi Klein her basic argument is that free markets are not popular and wherever someone wants to introduce them people are opposed to it so it means that free market supporters have to implement there ideas in another way they prefer \\"shocks\\" as Naomi says trying to \\"shock\\" people the voters into submission in times of a disaster, a war, a military coup or something like that then the free marketeers use the advantage that people are not on there guard so they in a very brief period of time introduce shock therapy and implement there free market policies.<br /><br />The problem with Naomi's book is that its over 500 pages long and she fails to support anything of this she fails to give empirical evidence. Her favorite villain is free market economist Milton Freeman. To make her case, Klein exaggerates the market reforms in question, often ignoring central events and rewriting chronologies. She confuses libertarianism with the quite different concepts of corporatism and neoconservatism. And she subjects Milton Friedman to one of the most malevolent distortions of a thinker's ideas in recent history.<br /><br />Exhibit A against Friedman is a quote from what Klein calls \\"one of his most influential essays\\": \\"Only a crisis-actual or perceived-produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\\" This, says Klein, is \\"the shock doctrine.\\"<br /><br />The quote is not, in fact, from one of Friedman's most influential essays; it's from a very brief introduction to a reprint of his book Capitalism and Freedom. And it is not a rationale for welcoming disasters; it's about the uncontroversial fact that people change their minds when the old ways seem to fail. Friedman provides a telling example, which Klein neglects to quote: Young Americans joined him in opposing the military draft after the Vietnam War forced them to risk their lives on another continent.<br /><br />She also distorts other Friedman quotes to support her case. She pretends that Friedman's concept of \\"the tyranny of the status quo\\" refers the tyranny of voters, and that he believed crises were needed to bypass the democratic process. But for Friedman, the tyranny was something entirely different: an iron triangle of politicians, bureaucrats, and special interest groups (businesses, for example) that deceive voters.<br /><br />Discussing Friedman's proposal to reduce inflation through sweeping market reforms, Klein writes, \\"Friedman predicted that the speed, suddenness and scope of the economic shifts would provoke psychological reactions in the public that `facilitate the adjustment.' \\" This gives the impression that Friedman wanted to disorient people through pain in order to push through his reforms. But the quote in its entirety shows that Friedman had something very different in mind. If a government chooses to attack inflation in this way, he wrote, \\"it should be announced publicly in great detail....The more fully the public is informed, the more will its reactions facilitate the adjustment.\\" In other words, if voters are not ignorant and not disoriented, but fully informed of the reform steps, they will facilitate the adjustment by changing their saving, consuming, and bargaining behavior. Friedman's view was the opposite of what Klein claims.<br /><br />Not content to misrepresent Friedman's opinions, Klein blames him for various crimes committed around the world. Most notably, she links him to Augusto Pinochet's brutal military dictatorship in Chile in the 1970s, writing that Friedman acted as \\"adviser to the Chilean dictator.\\"<br /><br />In fact, Friedmannever worked as an adviser to, and never accepted a penny from, the Chilean regime. He even turned down two honorary degrees from Chilean universities that received government funding, because he did not want to be seen as endorsing a dictatorship he considered \\"terrible\\" and \\"despicable.\\" He did spend six days in Chile in March 1975 to give public lectures, at the invitation of a private foundation. When he was there he met with Pinochet for about 45 minutes and wrote him a letter afterward, arguing for a plan to end hyperinflation and liberalize the economy. He gave the same kind of advice to communist dictatorships as well, including the Soviet Union, China, and Yugoslavia.<br /><br />I could keep going on about this but I think you get the point. This book is complete BS. People who don't know Milton Friedman will obviously believe these blatant lies. It's a good thing Milton's dead and he did not have to be around to see this BS!
B009X01C64|3.0|This is a nice, quality case with a few problems.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-good quality materials and construction...feels solid<br />-looks good<br />-seems like it would protect the Kindle well.<br />-auto off/on when you open/close the cover is great and almost solves the problem of the well hidden power button on the Kindle.  (you no longer have to hunt for the button.)<br />-great for charging while using as you can rotate the Kindle so that the charger connection is on the top.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-this is one bulky case.  it makes the Kindle look huge and thick and it probably doubles the weight.  No problem when it's propped up.  But when reading/viewing in bed or carrying around, it's too much.<br />-changing the screen orientation is not as easy as it could be.  If you're propped up in landscape and open an app that only works in portrait, you can't just spin it.  You have to un-prop it, lay the whole thing down and use two hands to grab the Kindle and rotate it.  (Often when doing this, I accidentally hit the power or volume button)  Then prop it up again.<br />Not a huge pain, but kinda.<br />-as others have mentioned, the Kindle snaps into a holder that is then only attached to the whole case at one end.  So with all the flipping around I have to do to use it, it's not unusual to not realize it's in a position to flip the Kindle holder right out, usually hitting the table I'm at.<br /><br />All in all an okay case.  But I am still looking for something better...
0307593312|5.0|1Q24 was the first book by Murakami that I read. I loved it. I couldn't put it down. I was so engaged with the story, that I ended up losing my passport on the plane from Puerto Rico to Miami, and had to reroute my flights through Buffalo NY so I could cross the Canadian border with my drivers license. I still remember the characters after a year. That to me is telling. I read a lot, serious books to pulp, fiction and non fiction, science and business.  I often cant remember enough of the fiction books to have a decent conversation about the plot/novel after time has passed( think Margaret Atwood books), but I cant help but remember this story. I then read Norwegian Wood, which I also loved. I have the Wind up Bird Chronicle and am saving it for my next vacation. If you like to read, and you like to read books that are memorable and engaging and books where you can actually recall the characters one year later, then I recommend this book for you.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Having all eight Harry Potter movies in the same box set is so convenient and you cannot beat the price!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I adore this CD, play it at Christmas as my first choice.  It's like stepping back in time to the good old days.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|We heard many favorable comments about this movie before we rented it.  Perhaps that was the problem and we had high expectations of being entertained and provided with many laughs.  In reality, we felt the movie was a stretch, an over the top and far out place with odd rooms, worn out old folks and some silly laugh lines.  Basically, we felt sad in the end for those who had hoped this would be the ideal place to retire, and for us as well for hoping it would be full of solid enjoyment.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|FUNNY. If you enjoy just a doo laugh without a need for plot you\\"ll enjoy this movie. Just enjoy the comic relief it brongs
B004BSFC46|4.0|We just got back from a Christmas trip across the country with our four month old twins.  It was hard to find small toys that were plane friendly & could not be thrown. These rattles were perfect!  They kept our little ones fascinated for hours.

B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I would give it 4 stars instead of five for only 2 reasons. One for not being totally real & two for not lasting longer. I could read this story for the rest of my life.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book i reccomend it to kids from the ages of 5-13 im pretty sure they'll like it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This book is a workmanlike effort.  It's not Clancy's best nor is it his worst.<br /><br />From my point of view he has gotten away from what he did best which was the military aspect and gone too far in following the characters he has created.<br /><br />He was at his best in Red Storm Rising and Hunt for Red October.  This feels like he fluffed out two hundred pages with love interests and lost sight of what got him to the status he's attained.<br /><br />Still a good read though.  Just not near his best work.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an am amazing novel that needs no rational to be considered awesome DFTBA and keep going on this. trail of life we perpetual are on.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This book to me was a frustrating read.  It was not set up well with the characters.  It seemed to bring in main characters too late in the book like it was a change of direction or an after thought.  When the villian of the story was the main character, it was repetitive.  His internal thought processes were overdone.  The author seemed as though trying to show how intense his thought process was but it just lent to the character going on and on needlessly with the point already made.  I just wanted to skip past those sections.  It was irritating reading his internal rants for what seemed like more than half of the book.  The quick switch at the end was sweet but it could have been set up better in the book. This is not a book i would ever attempt to read again and I don't think it was worth the few dollars I spent on it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a good, albeit dark, story. Well written. I enjoyed it enough to read the other books by Flynn.
0060920432|5.0|this book is a must read for everyone who wants to improve their quality of life. very well done book.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|This story plays out very much like the first Bourne movie.  A complete blast of a movie.. for action lovers this is high quality action that is definitely worth it.  It is NOT AT ALL like Verhoeven's Total Recall, which was a very different movie indeed.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.. its a shame it did not do well at the box office.
0312330537|5.0|L-O-V-E-D this book.  Got it as a gift and kind of forgot about it because I knew it would take a good portion of my life to finish it, and once I picked it back up 2 years later, it did.  Roberts is an amazing writer, visually descriptive style that paints the picture like a film in the mind.  Some of what happened sounded so surreal but upon doing some research on him afterwards, it seems like the truth.  I never wanted to put it down sometimes spending whole weekend afternoons in bed, saying, just one more chapter, and one more, and one more.  Definitely an experience to experience his journey, you won't be disappointed.
B0091WNK8M|1.0|If you enjoy potty humor an eleven year old boy would find funny, then this would fit the bill. The initial car chase was fun, but that was about it. It is extremely seldom that I do not finish a movie (this is perhaps the fifth one in my whole life), however, I was only able to endure it for about 30 minutes. If I were Spielberg, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated in any way with this.

B00006AW63|1.0|Hi - I bought the 101 Dalmatians DVD (vendor MovieMars) and it didn't work.  I bought it for my grandson for Christmas so what a disappointment it was when we got the error, \\"Wrong Region.\\"  MovieMars went on to explain that the order page had a disclaimer that this DVD may not work in the US.  I never thought to look for that. I'm very disappointed and will never order from this vendor again!

B009JBZH54|1.0|I LOVE all three of these films and the Blu-Rays look great, but the ULTRAVIOLET copies they come with are a joke.  Not only do you have to set up TWO accounts online, but an error with their systems has made it impossible for me to watch the digital copies.<br /><br />This is such a terrible system for delivering digital copies... I got this on Christmas day and here it is over a week later and I still cannot get the Ultraviolet copy to work with Flixster.  Their customer service is TERRIBLE!  I have emailed them six times and every time I get a generic response back telling me that nothing is wrong or give me generic directions on how to link my Ultraviolet and Flixster accounts, which is where I keep getting the same error MSG.<br /><br />I have since tried two other content providers, but neither of them allow you to download the films to an iPad (streaming only), so I am not able to watch them unless connected to WiFi?? How does this make any sense??<br /><br />I wish studios like Warner Brothers would not put so much faith behind such a TERRIBLE delivery system.  What was wrong with iTunes codes?  They are so much easier!  I will be trying to avoid anything that comes with UV or may just have to start buying titles on iTunes only.

B007TK77QE|5.0|Took a while to get to know all the characters, but once I did it was one of the best books I have read. I can't beleive that it got bad reviews, she is so honest in her writing and I can't wait till she writes another novel. I didn't read her Harry Potter books but I will make sure after reading this book that I do. This is one of those books where you carry it around with you, ignore your husband and are not happy to be making tea when you could be reading the book. I am 53 but I woould recommend it to any age group from 16 up.Loved it Loved it
B005AKFXZW|5.0|This book is beautifully crafted, captivating, sensational.<br />A story of enchanted magic, friendship, love, adventure.<br />I honestly could not put this book down, nor did I want it to end.<br />It has somehow moved me deep down... I am changed.

It opened my eyes to the adventure of life in a brand new way, as well as taught me about movements and characters in the art in a real but also fantastic way. She is an incredible human being, I'm so glad to be able to know some of her thoughts. The story itself is a jewel.

B004QK5N5W|1.0|Hello amazon people- I bought this device a few months ago, and it wouldnt work when I hooked it up to my dynex T.V. I believe its too late to return it, so I am wondering if anyone had a similar problem or if anyone has any suggestions as to what is wrong with it ( or which device is faulty):<br /><br />When I plug everything in, the tv recognizes it and it will work for a LITTLE while, but after 2 minutes or so it keeps turning off and then back on, it does this non stop... I really wish this would work because I dont have cable so this was going to be my way to pretend I did VIA netflix...<br /><br />any suggestion would be much appreciated!
B009738XXM|4.0|Carly Rae Jepsen is not just another one-hit-wonder. The album is full of dance-pop magic with only one or two tracks that lack the fun and sparkle of &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34; and &#34;Good Time.&#34; I think we can expect great things from this new artist!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The Fall of Giants was a very detailed account of, just prior to and during, the First World War.  Like all of Follett's books it is very detailed.  I learned a great deal that I did not know about all the aspects of the war from the countries involved.  Main characters included people from Britain, Russia, Germany and the United States.  Thus, the war was seen from many views.  The book dragged on toward the end, but overall I found it an interesting and thought provoking read.  I am looking forward to the sequal.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I can't say that I dislike anything about my purchase.  The best part was that it only cost $5.00.  Every song is amazing and I'm truly in awe of this film as well as the cast.

B0041KVW2K|1.0|Like everyone, I was expecting nothing but an absolutely perfect product. The box itself came undamaged and the book is great but when it comes to what really matters - the quality of the pressings... well, most records in my box play with \\"just\\" minor issues, and the remastering itself is wonderful, but my Sgt Peppers copy has severe distortion on side A (mainly on the left channel's bottom end), that same distortion is clear on the song Baby You Are A Rich Man on MMT and Abbey Road is unlistenable in places, with loud pops, hiss, tics, distortion - a disaster - so I'm in the process of returning these three highly defective albums, and thinking if it's better to stick with the copies that are \\"almost ok\\" or returning many of the copies - running the risk of receiving even worse ones...so sad. This was supposed to be an impecable release from the most important band ever. What a let down.<br /><br />Update 01/12/13: Received a new copy of Sgt Peppers (from another box that my local store already had), but it came with exactly the same problems!!!!!!!<br /><br />Update 01/19/13 Another copy of Sgt Peppers arrived (my second replacement), and replacements of Magical Mystery Tour and Abbey Road. ALL have the same defects as the previous copies!!!! It seems the hole batch dispatched to my local store is just crap.<br />I've contacted EMI/Capitol's customer service and asked for GOOD copies to replace the bad ones, and I got an answer saying they are working to correct the problem and are sending me replacements from the three albums above. I'd advice everyone to do the same!<br /><br />Update 03/12/13 Got an email today from EMI/Capitol saying that replacement copies are shipping directly from Rainbo Records.<br /><br />Update 04/10/13 Received a package from Rainbo. The LPs came in plain white outer sleeves plus inner sleeves. Abbey Road sounds a lot better, but both Sgt Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour have exactly the same defects, a gross distortion on the bottom end on some tracks. I happen to have two different sets of turntable/receiver/audiophile earphones, and the distortion is clearly audible on both setups. I now believe that pressing decent copies of some titles is simply BEYOND Rainbo's hability. I'll just give up. What a shame.nd on some tracks.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is such an interesting book.  So many crazy things going on you must wonder how the author came up with this type of a story.  They say that a little bit of the author may be in each character they write -- makes you wonder what type of person G. Flynn is in person!  I would be thrilled to try her other novels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was very erotic, yet romantic at the same time. I've heard tell of it from friends and decided to try it out!
0743270754|5.0|Interesting book. I really learned a lot about Lincoln, his staff and congress. Not a lot has changed in 150 years as far as congress goes. The personalities of his cabinet was interesting. I had history in collage but this was more informative.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Dowloaded this to see what all they hype was about.  Funny game as well as entertaining.  Should enjoy it while traveling.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I purchased this app because I really enjoy the series. It asks for another $5 to get all of the places. Guess you don't get what you pay for anymore.
145162445X|2.0|Krauss' introductory discussion of the issue of \\"nothing\\" in philosophy betrays his arrogant dogmatic scientism, which includes a contempt for anything that doesn't meet  scientific standards and criteria. He, like all too many scientists, has no inkling of the reflexive difficulties inherent in the world view he espouses which includes a tacit, implicit conception of what language is and does. In my view the best summary of the innate problem of self-reference is Hilary Lawson's [[ASIN:0812690117 Reflexivity: The Post-Modern Predicament]]; for an exploration of theories of language, see [[ASIN:0739147137 Language and the Ineffable: A Developmental Perspective and Its Applications]]. Krauss ought to be a good deal more modest about his position, ought to be aware of the huge lacunae in scientism that have been explored by numerous thinkers such as Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Derrida, Quine.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the female character is far to similar to a character in another of Green's books (no spoilers here :P). Otherwise, I really enjoyed this story.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The way the story is told is a metaphor for the night circus itself...sometimes confusing but always intriguing, enticing you in without issuing a map of the grounds, leaving you to discover its magic and mystery incrementally. Although they're VERY different stories and venues, it reminds me somehow of a less-humanistic Callahan's Crosstime Saloon.  I'd love to see it made into a movie, but have grave doubts Hollywood can be trusted not to turn it into a CGI-driven mess.  Maybe if the people who made Across the Universe got interested?  I can't wait to see what this author chooses to write next.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I like this game and for the purpose of others I recommend this app I got it for free as a free app .of the day
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I downloaded books for the long airplane trip from Hawaii to Wisconsin and return.  I had about 30 hours of reading time to fill.  I hav always liked John Grisham's books, and this one was fun and engaging.  I recommend it for light reading that will keep you turing pages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My friend really  liked this book so I decided to give it a try and I loved it .<br />At some parts it was violent but that's just the way things are sometimes.<br />I am  inspired inspired by Katness' strength and  bravery.<br />I am so glad Susanne Collins chose to be an (amazing) author.<br />Poor Rue was my favorite character.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I forcibly made sure I had no real expectations for this book, since I'd read a number of mixed reviews--many of which said that the Harry Potter orientation toward Rowling would work to a reader's disadvantage.  Having now completed this book, I have to say that it was very well written and fundamentally interesting.  However, it is a bit of a downer overall with just a little redemption in the final pages.<br /><br />I would not want to re-invest time in reading another Rowling book that is of this genre.  She has the ability to absolutely carry you away with her writing (even in this book).  I just hope that her next effort is a little grander and not so bogged down in so much tedium and an overall &#34;so what&#34; perspective.  The number of characters you have to keep track of his really excessive.  (Thank god for my Kindle, where I can go back easily and check out the names of the characters to re-connect with their context!)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Once I started reading I had to finish. I am going to have to read the rest of the series and maybe see the movie.
0316227706|5.0|Got this book for holiday presents, and they were a hit! The photos are stunning, the dogs are to-die-for both in the water and on land. The book will continue bringing lots of smiles and laughs to dog lovers...
B007MDB548|1.0|I AM STRONGLY NOT HAPPY BECAUSE  WITH THIS MOVIE BECAUSE, KIDS GETING READY TO WACHT BUT IT WAS NNO PICTURES ON THE SCREEN.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love this story on so many levels. From the way words are twisted and played with to the heart warming story of Liesel. I do warn you this book is not for just lazy readers who want action packed romance and explosions. ( to be honest this book doesn't really have many huge plot moment but each one of those moment leads up to a major point) This book plays on the emotions under the words. It would be very hard to understand if you didn't know a few definitions here and there. It isn't a really easy text as far as young adult books usually go. But if you put the effort into understanding the emotions it turns out into being a very beautiful story. Also I'm assuming the bad end of these reviews are from people who didn't really want to think meaningfully of the words in the book or who never finished.
B003Y3GTNC|5.0|EL PRUDUCTO FUE ENTREGADO CON LAS ESPECIFICACIONES MOSTRADAS, EN EL TIEMPO OPORTUNO Y EN LA FECHA ESTIMADA. RECOMIENDO 100%. EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!
B0086700CM|3.0|The game itself is fun and a bit addictive, but it constantly crashes on our new Kindle Fire.  Fortunately it was free so I can't be too upset about it but I wish it would work.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I love the premise. I am applying some of the concepts to my life and seeing great results. I highly recommend it.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|its soooo much fun and the animals are super cute but this game uses lots of bling gems and hearts and those are hard to get. the movie theater is supposed to give you 2 bling everytime you watch a movie but it never pays up. and my friend and I were playing together. she was on her ipad and I was on my kindle. her ipad gave her the option of free bling. mine wouldn't so I have barely any bling. and one of the quests on this game is to add a friend and when we added each other,  she got the quest crossed off and the prize for completeing it and I didn't get anything. it still said that I hadn't done the quest.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It's great how you can adjust the volume of each sound to make yourself the perfect sleeping sound.<br />Totally planning on buying the upgrade when I get the money to do so.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Recommend others to watch this film. It's the one that Brad and Jolie got together for a film. It's funny and action packed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My wife enjoyed this book. She found it difficult to stop reading. She would definitely recommend this book to others.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Made a great Christmas present that the whole family could enjoy. Would make future purchases from them in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg this is the best app ever I thought is was boreing at first but I got in to it and it is a really really fun game
B004XANKVO|4.0|it's a wonderful backpack worthy of your money. The only thing I didn't anticipate is that it's not really that suitable for school. Also it's a little bit heavier than it seems.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending. Best series of all times, Very emotional. Upset that ive finished it, I wish there was more! but I plan to read the series again soon!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It allows me to charge my Kindle when & wherever it's convenient, rather than only from my desktop iMac.  Takes about the same amount of time & is fully satisfactory.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This is a fun book written by one of my favorite authors. Perfect for just relaxed reading with a happy ending.
1465001123|4.0|I think the pictures of Taylor Swift could have been better. But it is a nice calendar. Mostly black and white photo's are used.
B0001US8EO|5.0|Although it came out close to &#34;Tombstone&#34;, the two films complement each other in presenting a fuller picture of the lives and times of the Earp brothers. Long and deliberate, it never bores the viewer, and the supporting cast is stellar.The production design alone is worth the viewing.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I still look forward to new Pendergast tales, and Two Graves was no exception.  I'll keep reading them as long as Lincoln and Child write them.
B00005JO1R|5.0|The chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix is what makes this work. The special edition has a wealth of extras. Not to be missed!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I know why downton Abbey is so wonderful. The quality of actors and actresses are phenomenal. I can't wait for season 3.
B002N44XSG|4.0|It was a pretty good mini series of events. And I enjoyed the puzzles and small features in it, such as the interviews and the 12 Olympians facts at the end. I would enjoy reading more of the books.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is for those people who like an adventure game that will last months.  There are exciting levels and quests as the game progresses.  The only downside is that you can only play for 15 to 20 min a day or you have to pay for more energy.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|The story line was obvously contrived by someone employed by Kindle/Amazon.  The reader was just a pawn in the book selling game.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|These days, I feel like it's entirely too hard to find a great movie about something spectacular. This film blew me away. I've probably seen it over 2 dozen times since it came out and I can't get enough. I love the way Jesse Eisenburg acts in this movie. I'm not a Justin Timberlake fan but he did pretty well too. Definitely recommend you see this movie. It also has a great soundtrack!
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|If you are looking for a fast paced action flick, this will work great.  If you're expecting more, you will be disappointed, but that's not why you select this movie.  Creative cinematography and JGL always delivers.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I need quick and simple. The report is accurate enough to plan outdoor events.<br />I haven't found 24 hour precip stats yet.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Special effects are great.  The movie is boring... it just drags.<br /><br />The acting is OK, but Bale is overrated in this &#34;final&#34; movie.
B008R14YBK|4.0|Perfect for  the good Luck Charlie Fans, especailly my six year old.<br />As expected, and enjoyable to dance especially for children
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I decided after jumping on the bandwagon and falling in love with the Walking Dead TV series on AMC that I should try the novels. I am not a fan of comics or picture-type pieces but I have been glued to this series since I have started. I actually had nightmares about zombies the night I read this issue, which tells me this had a great impact on me.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|The movie was great me and my sisters enjoyed the movie it was pretty action packed....surprisingly. Would watch again and one more time.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Gave this set as a gift to a friend who is a big fan of the series. He is very happy with the set and gives it very high marks.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I'm a fan of the show and wasn't sure what go expect. Really enjoyed it though!<br />I'm looking forward to reading the next volume.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|After 11 years it still holds up as being fun To see. The acting is great .  The songs and dancing are lively
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Being married to a OIF/OEF Marine Vet I found the portrayal with war and veteran life was respectful and honest… I enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. I like how it just kept moving didn't need half a page to set the tone yet it was detailed. Recommend!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Mind blowing fantasy of a lifetime best book in the series yet can't wait for the next one<br />Mockingjay will be amazing I just know it
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I originally played this game on PC years ago and loved it. Now that its available on android everyone that loves puzzle games should give it a try.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I Love Bonnie Raitt she can walk on water as well as play a mean guitar. It's been too long between albums, so come on Ms Raitt how about more product in less time. I Love what you do. So more please, Oh!!!!.... and come tour down under again.<br />So folks, Buy This, You'll Dig It.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My genre is more adult contemporary..but after reading the free sample.. and the 800+ reviews I had to see what all the rave was about..and I was not disappointed.<br />Since the main characters are 17 and 18.. I was not interested in heavy sex scenes..and there weren't any... the joy of reading this book was purely a  very well written, very well character developed story that pulled<br />you in and never let you go until the very last page.
B0020MMBCG|2.0|The material didn't fit the cover so shame of me for judging this book by ...<br /><br />I believe books like this are meant to simplify our work but even reading it was difficult; at least for this simple mind. And if I must, the shape of the book may be clever but it doesn't fit in the bookshelf well at all. Just not what I expected.
B008ROH07W|4.0|Alison Balsom is definitely one of the best trumpet players of our time. She plays the natural horn better than I've ever heard it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The music is very good, it is definitely in the &#34;alternative&#34; range but it has its very good qualities. The instruments are very good and dynamic. The vocals are clear and crisp, this is one of the best albums fun. has.
B00679T1EO|2.0|I am upset because it didn't include the complete 2nd season.  This DVD was missing the last episode-the Christmas episode which contained important elements to the story.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This one to me is by far the best out of the 3 movies, it has a ton of action and great acting. It does not follow the book exactly but as a movie adaption it is very good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Helps to stimulate my brain but I don't  have to work to hard at it.  Is fun and can quit and go back to it at any time
B000I9VON0|5.0|Robert Redford delivers in this movie, and so does his supporting cast. The acting is superb and even for it being dated is a must have for any nerd/hacker movie lover. It is very intense up until the last second and even had some good humor to make it a good lighthearted and enjoyable movie.
0688014291|5.0|3 key tips told in a story format that follows a journalist looking for guidance on the best mangers.<br /><br />No cons - only pros (for the price I paid):<br />* Simple principles<br />* More entertaining than a straight management book just on principles and facts<br />* Quick to read - took me about 30 mins, but I'm a quickish reader<br />* Paid for a cheaper version (second hand book) - so good value as I'll probably end up giving it away anyway.<br /><br />The difficulty will be applying the tips in a consistent manner.
B001UG56ES|3.0|Actually, I only watched it because I really like Hugh Jackman in Les Miz and I wanted to see what else he'd done.  Australia starts out like a lame romance, but it improves dramatically by the end.  Overall I think it's a great movie to watch for cultural reasons, and it does stop being cheesy.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|this app is too funny. having lots of fun with it and other people. everyone needs to laugh. buy this app for some laughs.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|I choose to own very few movies because I rarely watch things enough times to warrant it, but this never seems to get old.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|this is great with my new kindle. useful app. i will probably end up retiring my lap top. kindle does it all
1439153663|5.0|Love getting books in the mail.  Read this on my flight to Hawaii in September.  Great way to pass the time away!
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|The game was off to a good start but I have barely gotten into it and I am stuck in the managers office at the safe.  Even the hint runs me in circles with no advancement. According to my objectives I don't even see why I am there! It is so frustrating. Awful.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest!!  I recently has surgery so this was nice to sit in bed and distract me from not getting too bored!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is great to follow Mitch Rapp in his latest adventure.  It is interesting how the research in Grisham's books ties into current world events.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs, this was a great insight into the mind of this man.  Have reccomended this book and even loaned this out!
B000LTAY1U|3.0|I made the mistake of thinking 'automatic' meant 'care free'. Wrong. I bought this watch as a casual, wear on the weekends watch. However, without wearing it for a day, it stops. Then you have to reset it before wearing it again, and this is not a trivial process if you actually want the day/date to be right. I'm returning it. Good looking watch, but also don't like the band Del on my arm.
159562015X|5.0|One of my responsibilities is to meet individually with the pastors in the Archdiocese of Atlanta. This book is one that I give as a gift to thank them for meeting with me. It's a GREAT book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book I can't wait to read the next chapter. Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
B008KYDUYG|5.0|Green day came on to the music scene in the mid 1990s, and became superstars overnight due to a pop-punk sound all their own. 2 decades later, they are still going strong, doing their own thing, often going in new directions.<br /><br />In anticipation of the new studio albums from Green Day released in 2012, Uno, Dos, and Tre, the band released this compilation, which is exactly what it says - a set of all their studio albums released from 1990-2009. In America, the compilation is an exclusive release at Best Buy stores, and retails for $39.99 (any sellers on here trying to get more than that are ripping you off.)<br /><br />These are the albums you get in the set:<br /><br />-39 Smooth (1990)<br /><br />-Kerplunk! (1992)<br /><br />-Dookie (1994)<br /><br />-Insomniac (1995)<br /><br />-Nimrod (1997)<br /><br />-Warning (2000)<br /><br />-American Idiot (2004)<br /><br />-21st Century Breakdown (2009)<br /><br />The first 2 albums include all of the same EP bonus tracks as their individually released counterparts. Likewise, all other CDs are identical to the individual releases, and there are no bonus tracks or anything of the like. They are in slim paper sleeves without liner notes.<br /><br />This compilation scores points for delivering exactly what it promises, and doing that for a very good, low price as well. I wish they had gone the extra mile and thrown in some extra things/tracks/etc., but at this price I really cannot complain. My biggest complaints are that they did not include the Shenanigans rarities compilation, the Foxboro Hot Tubs album, and the live albums, but none of these are really \\"studio albums\\" so I guess I will not be complaining too much over that stuff.<br /><br />If you are looking to jumpstart your Green Day collection, this compilation will make a fine addition to your music library. Strongly recommended!

B009IF82SK|4.0|Still a good show but i liked it better when the guys were single. I liked the humor of the guys interacting with girls but now they are married or have girlfriends this is mostly gone from he show.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Love the music, love the price! This is the first time I purchased mp3 music from Amazon. Still trying to figure out how to access without paying for time
B00439MV42|4.0|Enjoyed seeing it again.  A bit of language in all of the series but still good entertainment for the older kids
B00432QAKK|5.0|Being a fan of this show it is great that to watch a show when you want to it great.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Enjoy the difference in the game from previous game with same old birds. Incorporates different colorful birds in cages and colorful fish as well.
1402793375|5.0|Bought this book for one of my 11 year old Grandsons who loves American History.  Truthfully I considered keeping it for myself it was so wonderful, from the sotries to the pictures, a true treasure.<br />Of all the gifts I purchased this Christmas that was the one with the best value for the money.<br />Chris G.
B005PK553C|5.0|A little terrifying and disturbing but well written and edge of seat entertainment.  Definite must see.  Can't wait to see the next season.  Jessica Lange is great.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I always loved this games since its came out. You fly the Mad Chicken at things its great games. Thank you so much for making this game.
0061134007|4.0|Jo Nesbo writes sparingly and yet detailed. Her characters learn and become people you want to know.  Sometimes she makes you work out the answer rather than spelling it out. thoroughly  charming and readable and a page turner.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Her book gave me peace and joy.  I know, 'tis the season, but I felt so good reading this book.  Enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|(fyi)if you cant tilt it go to settings and adjust it!! I love this game! I don't even no what ti say I finished all the objectives except for two. I recomend this to people who  sit around all day doing nothing and people who love challenges! it is a challenging game and they have many challenges for you to some are easy some are hard! play this game I dare you!! :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Couldn't put this book down.  I am a wife and mother of two plus I work full time and read it in three days.  This book brings you out of your sexual shell and allows you to explore your own fears and desires. Although I really enjoyed this book it could have had a bit more plot and a bit less sex...just a bit. My husband wants me to buy the other two books.  ;-)
B005XLN97M|5.0|Just the right size - not huge.  Setup was pretty easy with the directions provided.  4 year old loves it and has been playing with it often.
B00006AFF5|5.0|This is one for the whole family to sit down at christmas time and watch. You will laugh so hard.!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm downloading a few new apps due to an upcoming surgery where I'll be on the couch for a while.  I'm already addicted to it!
B0038P59A0|5.0|Action, plot twists, and fine jobs done by the actors and film crew!<br />Love this just as much now as in 2010
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|We bought this for our 8-year old son for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. The finished product has some really neat features (functional landing gear, satellite that deploys from the cargo bay). I would highly recommend this product. Best Lego build we have purchase yet...and we have purchased several others.

B00992CF6W|5.0|All it really needs is herobrine pets ender men and the ability to spawn stuff in creative mode but other wise its great
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|there was to much story telling and very little game time.  it would of made a better book.  It was mildly intertaining
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved it. Can't wait to read another one.  I love to read. Love romance books. All I look for in reading a good book.
0399230033|5.0|I love this book! The joy and laughter that comes out of my toddler makes this a must for book collection
B003O86FMW|5.0|This so far is one of the best trilogies I have had the pleasure of reading and I'm not even done
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful calculator. It works as described and it looks great on the kindle fire hd. A great calculator for a great device.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved ever single part, although there was less-shall I same-sex. In some parts it skipped over the sex and went for something else. I'm not too fond  of that is I shall say. I love the way it adds heart ache as she says she's leaving him and  I love the thrill of the anger they give to one another. My boyfriend and  I will sure will be very pleased…with all of the Grey series. I wouldn't mind a Christian Grey as my dominant/boyfriend/husband/father of my children. A very nice character I might add. They all were…especially Ana, strong willed and shy at times-reminds me of myself at times. Very excellent book, like always I would recommend this book to everyone and anyone.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|If you started watching Walking Dead later into the Series 2, this DVD is a must have.  It lets you see how it all began and how all the characters in the current group came together.  It is only 6 episodes, but it also has extra bonus features added, but it makes it about half the price of the other DVD's in this Series.  We loved all the episodes!  The last episode in Season 1 was great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me smiling at the beginning and rooting for Holder and Sky to be together. As I read farther I realized this was more than a chick or romance book, so much more.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Haven't played this game yet with my grandson but I know it will be fun and a perfect game for him!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I got this app cause it looked like fun....it turned out to be great and very addicting.  Lol.  It runs smooth on my kindle fire hd and I have not had one problem.  I would recommend this fun app to everyone.  This game makes you think outside the box a bit in order to solve the situations in the game adventure.  I love the fact that I got to draw my own stick character.  You will be pleasantly surprised at how much fun it is.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Got it for my daughter...I play with it! My daughter and I fight over who is going to play, and what color we are going to use..This is a very cute app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW!  Couldn't put it down.  Read the entire book at one sitting. I can't wait until I have time to buy the final book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addicting I like it. Nice to have Something fun to pass the time... I don't have anything else to say.. give it a try
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I am so glad that I purchased this MP3 download!!!  What a great album.  I will be getting their first album next!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I like this app. It has so much information. I don't think I've used it all yet. You can go to a specific date and time and it will tell you all I need to know and more.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|WHAT ELSE COULD ONE EXPECT FROM JAMES TAYLOR, SURELY ONE OF THE MOST 'SPIRITUAL' OF SINGERS. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR 'FAITH', HE , AS ALWAYS, TAPS INTO THE ESSENCE OF FAITH....... FOR ALL MANKIND!  MAY THIS RECORDING SYMBOLIZE ANEW; OUR HOPE OF 'PEACE ON EARTH AND GOODWILL TOWARD MEN'.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to pass idle time during all the bowl games!<br />I could do without all the annoying pop- up ads, but considering the game is free, I can put up with them.<br />Love the quickness of the card movement.<br />Fun game!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love all of these books!  I am very excited for the next installment! Can't wait until next fall! Yah
B001JU4S44|3.0|Fast paced, lots of action, but really implausible.  The incredible disguises seem to appear magically.  Still, we enjoyed it and Phillip Seymour Hoffman makes a terrific bad guy.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love show each season makes it better and better. I am definitely hooked and this season makes it more intense with each season
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, ticks away nervous time......great graphics, best of all it was free!  I hope there is more to come with the creators......
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I wish it was more consistent with any one theory for time travel paradoxes or the concepts were so far away from reality that the inconsistencies weren't aggravating.  Otherwise, I thought the movie was well done and very engaging.

0142418471|4.0|What was great about this book is the fact that it was so obviously written by two different authors. The story is that of two high school aged youth boys in Illinois both named Will Grayson. The story is told in two points of view with each chapter being voiced by the two Will Grayson's (eg. Chapter one is Will Grayson 1 and chapter 2 is Will Grayson 2 and chapter 3 is Will Grayson 1 again, etc. etc.). The voices are obviously different and the fact that each author wrote the POV of one Will Grayson worked PERFECTLY. I had no idea that this was the style that the two authors were doing so halfway through chapter 2 I realized that Will Grayson 1 wasn't actually suffering from a bi-polar disorder, but rather it was the other Will Grayson narrating.<br /><br />The trend of dystopian fiction and vampire fiction in YA literature as of late has been exhausted, in my humble opinion, so it was very refreshing to read a story about \\"normal\\" high school students dealing with \\"normal\\" high school problems. I also enjoyed this book because it really is a very good LGBT choice. One of the Will Grayson's is gay and the other Will Grayson's best friend is gay. A few of the supporting characters are also gay and several characters belong to a gay/straight alliance at school. A major event in the book revolves around a very gay character writing, directing, producing and staring in a musical designed to bring an understanding and a tolerance to gay students. The book is at the same time heartwarming and heart breaking. I loved it. It had humor, love, and honesty. The ending took a weird turn for me so I couldn't give it the full 5 stars that it could have earned. However, I do recommend it for anyone who may be gay or questioning, especially high school students. This is not a YA book that I would recommend to my middle school students (the language and some of the situations were a little advanced). This is a book that could be beneficial to bullies who may be harassing gay students. This is even a good book for adult parents of gay teenagers and it's just a good book for anyone looking for a good read. It was a quick read (I read it in a day). 4 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />This review was originally published at bookjackets.wordpress.com
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My one year old twins LOVE the minions.  They watch them on YouTube constantly.  We got this for them for Christmas, and they couldn't be happier.  Such a cute movie.
0345803485|2.0|In 1841 the delightful Edgar Allan Poe gave birth to the detective genre with his engrossing story The Murder in the Rue Morgue. Since this story we have had many novels and stories written that fit neatly into the puzzle/detective/thriller/mystery genre. The Devotion of Suspect X by Kiego Higashino fit into all of those categories with a hint of romance thrown in as well. I have to admit that I am a fan of the these genres. When I was younger I would pour over the \\"mystery specials\\" in my favorite series: Babysitter's Club, Sweet Valley High, etc. I read and carefully re-read parts of The Boxcar Children so that I might be able to work alongside my new friends Henry, Violet, Benny and Jessie and solve each mystery. I love to watch the Sherlock Holmes movies and series on PBS. The PBS Mysteries always stump me, but I get a thrill out of them none the less. Being involved in a mystery rather it be in movie, televised or in novel form is always a great source of entertainment for me. I try to solve the puzzle as best as I can by careful observations and readings. I believe that a good mystery or detective story is a game of a puzzle between the author and the reader. That being said, this book was not a fun puzzle at all.<br /><br />The Devotion of Suspect X is a sensational Japanese thriller that was so popular that it was developed into a film in the country. The story starts out with a very devoted-to-her-daughter single mother who works in a deli shop and lives in an apartment building in Tokyo and basically keeps to herself and lives her life. One day her abusive, greedy and blackmailing ex-husband tracks her down and shows up uninvited to her apartment. Soon this man is dead which leads to an unlikely knight in shining armor from next door stepping in to help with the cover up.  Two police detectives show up for the investigation of the murder and resort to relying on a Sherlock Holmes type for help. This helper is none other than genius Physicist Yukawa who, wouldn't ya know it, just happens to be friends with Ishigami, our unlikely hero. This novel played out like a very messy game of chess between the two geniuses.  Both Yukawa and Ishigami are extremely observant and intelligent and constantly one upping each other until the final unbelievable plot twist ending. Once we got to this unsatisfying ending there were several strings that were left untied. A suicide attempt was mentioned, but never dealt with again. A romance began and brought about a surprise proposal, but, again, was never mentioned a second time. To me, detective novels need to end with all questions answered. I don't want the Soprano's ending, I want to know. I wasn't 100% devoted to this novel, but I was devoted to finishing it and discovering what had really happened, which, disappointingly, I never got to do with some aspects of the novel.<br /><br />Somewhere it is written (I know because somewhere I've read) that the reader, upon careful reading should be allowed the chance to solve the mystery. At the end of The Devotion of Suspect X we are given several, very far-fetched facts that we would have no way of ever figuring out from the text alone. This particular puzzle that I played with Higashino was one that left me feeling cheated; he had an unfair advantage over his reader by not disclosing items earlier. As I read I feel that I make friends with the characters in the books. Solving mysteries and living in a boxcar are vivid memories from my childhood. I felt close to the main character of this book. I felt simultaneous sympathy and admiration for this man. But he had been cheating me the entire time as well. He withheld facts from me and he lied to me and he hid things from me. I believe that Poe would be disappointed in the sloppy way this novel ended and would wonder what has become of the genre that he gifted us with so long ago.<br /><br />This review was originally published at bookjackets.wordpress.com
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I'm excited to share it with my one year old twins as they get older.  They already have Lightning McQueen toys that they won't put down... now to get them to sit down and watch a movie, I'm sure this will soon be a favorite.
B006QS0PF0|3.0|I started out LOVING this book! It was so interesting to get insight into the life of a relatively unknown actress like de Rossi. It moved along so quickly for the first 3/4 of the book, but then it just started repeating itself. We heard a lot about dress sizes and Vera, her costume person on the set of Ally McBeal, as well as all of the places that she burst into a run in her platform shoes; and that was great, at first. I wanted to hear more about Francesca and Ellen and Mel! I wanted the dirt!<br />I understand that when a person elects to pen a story of their life, that they are able to discuss certain things and they may also leave things out. However, I wanted to hear more about her private life that is only glossed over with back-alley photographs and airbrushed wedding portraits in the tabloids. Don't get me wrong, I love me some tabloids, but I also love getting the real inside scoop straight from the horse's mouth which is why I thought that this memoir in particular would be a little bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />It was a pretty good book overall though. I thought that the end section with Ellen was very rushed and I would have liked to have read more of the happy-ending stuff that was so forced and so quick and then suddenly over. I found myself skimming as I got more towards the end to get to the happy and away from the misery.<br /><br />I think that I would recommend this book to someone, especially someone who may be gay or who may be struggling with an eating disorder. Overall, one of the better memoirs that I've ever read (not that I've read many!)<br /><br />This review was originally published at bookjackets.wordpress.com
0307719774|5.0|I love to write, and I love to journal. However, time is ALWAYS the limiting factor for me, and sometimes I don't even bother getting started because I only have a few minutes to spare. That's where this book comes in! There is only a few lines for each year's allotment, so you can polish off each question while you're taking a ten minute breather between other Stuff To Do. The questions are funny, interesting or thought provoking, and always enjoyable. I find myself looking forward to opening the book each day and contemplating the question and writing my answer. I'm REALLY looking forward to rereading each answer when, as the years go by, I have multiple answers on each page as I get to it!<br /><br />Admittedly, it is a bit small, and it doesn't lie flat, which does make writing easier, but honestly, since you're writing one or two sentences, three MAX, it's not THAT hard to deal with the binding.<br /><br />Overall, I love it and I'm really glad I bought it as a treat for myself while I was holiday shopping on Amazon last month!

B009JBZH54|5.0|I pre-ordered the Dark Knight trilogy for my son for Christmas.  Amazon shipped very quickly after the release, and issued me a refund when the price went down.  The price of the collection is cheaper than buying each movie individually.  The quality of the blu-ray picture and sound is unbelievable.

B00AFROVQC|3.0|I had a hard time with this book. I liked it well enough to finish it,,,But I struggled. It was a little too short for my taste and I disliked the ending and thought it was cheap. There were so many instances where I was just shaking my head at what just occurred and though,\\" You have to be kidding Me!\\" and then it would happen again,,,,and again,,,,,and again. And Nothing really happens enough to warrant a whole book out it.When it ended I felt like it was only 1/3 of the way done.  Again the book is quite short and There are a very limited number of scenes and they are the standard scenarios that you have read a hundred times in a hundred other books. I will give the second book a try because I am curious about Thor's true origins, but that is about it. I'm not really hooked on any of the other situations that are going on in the novel.<br /><br />I don't regret buying it, but it wasn't a satisfying read and I'm really confused by all the 5 star ratings, to be honest.

B003K16P3M|5.0|I had few expectations of Graceling. I think I initially bought it because I needed something light, and had read a good review of Bitterblue, so I thought I'd start at the beginning of the series. I was blown away, and I recommend this book to any teen, or to adults who want escapism that isn't offensively dumb.<br /><br />There were many things to love about this book. Katsa is a wonderful character. She is smart, strong, conflicted. She grows so much as a character in a way that is easy to relate to. She starts out believing she is what people tell her she is--brutal, vicious, unstable. But in the end, she realizes she can define herself, and although she did horrible things in the past, she can change and choose to act out of love and kindness. She is a wonderful role model for young women in a world full of terrible role models.<br /><br />Her relationship with Po is something I don't think I have ever seen portrayed in a YA book. They love each other as equals, like each other, respect each other including respect for each others skills, talents, and space. Po doesn't want to change her, put her on a pedestal, or box her in. He loves her for who she is, and as such, respects that she doesn't want to be married or have children. There is a wildness to her, and rather than trying to tame her, he sets her free. This is the kind of relationship I want for myself, and for my children. On another note, I loved that the characters actually talked about birth control, and the feelings that surround that.<br /><br />Last, the ending. A friend who read it recently was so pissed that it wasn't wrapped up in a tidy bow, but that is one of the things I loved about the book. It's messy and complicated, as is life, but the characters still choose to muddle along, trying their best to do the right thing, to act out of love.

B004OZZ624|3.0|Suspenseful, but ridiculously implausible. We're supposed to believe that a mild-mannered English teacher would suddenly become a master criminal...breaking out a prisoner (his wife) from a high security urban prison with help from 2 minutes of advice from an ex-con (I watched this film largely for Liam Neeson and he had barely more than a cameo appearance), a couple of You Tube videos and some suddenly acquired inner-street verve that enabled him to kill two snarly drug dealers and elude half of the Pittsburg police force.<br /><br />I'm all for rooting for the underdog (though it makes it a lot tougher when that underdog kills two human beings whose particular crimes had nothing to do with him) but in this case, the plot was so beyond belief that it was hard to be on on the hero's cheering squad. Added to that,  you simply could not believe that his wife (who we never really get to know--hence care about) was suffering all that much in prison as they depicted no scenes of her enduring the harshness and humiliation of daily prison life. We needed to see the stark contrast of what it would be like for a young mother and working professional to go from a safe and comfortable life to suddenly facing the shock of being thrown in a decidedly non-white collar prison...and know that she would be there for the rest of her natural born days. The emotionally charged scene they did show was rather abrupt--especially because we didn't see what led up to that radical change. The wife went from patient tolerance at being unfairly incarcerated to a tough, suicidal inmate seemingly overnight...hence your prison bravado simply wasn't believable.<br /><br />Including those kinds of scenes would have at least made you feel more sympathetic to the prospect of this innocent wife and mother being broken out of prison--even if the cost was higher than it should be in doing so.<br /><br />Also implausible was the grandfather's (played by Brian Dennehy who did not look well in this film) complicity in the crime after discovering his son's passports. No father or grandfather would willingly let his son try the impossible feat of breaking his wife out of a maximum security prison, thereby ensuring that his son also would also go to prison or be killed during the escape attempt--leaving his grandson without either a mother or a father. (With the grandparents being clearly too old to raise him themselves.)<br /><br />Continuity issues also plagued this film, not the least of which was the sudden transition of Elizabeth Bank's greasy straight prison hair to a fresh expensive looking salon wash n' wear style while they were running from the Pittsburg police force. Splashing water on one's hair from a bathroom sink would NOT have produced that look.<br /><br />One final note: Jason Beghe is in this film--you gotta love him in anything. He's a Mr. Gravely-voiced, gutsy Scientology defecting one-man show. :)

B005LAIIJY|4.0|****1/2<br />When watching a Quentin Tarantino film, there are a lot of familiar elements to be expected: An inventive pastiche of genres (often delivered with tongue firmly in cheek). Excessive, cartoonish violence. The use of iconic actors in often unexpected roles. Scenes full of clever, tense dialog that often end up exploding in brutality. And, if you look carefully, hidden beneath all the flash and stunts and gore, moments of genuine emotional resonance.<br /><br />By all this criteria, \\"Django Unchained\\" is typical Tarantino. What makes the film unique among his cannon, and so controversial, is its subject matter. After all, is there any more subject more taboo in modern America than race? And does anything stir up more complex and unresolved feelings among the races than by bringing up our country's shameful history of slavery?<br /><br />First and foremost, this film is extremely entertaining. I often get bored or impatient during long films, but not once during it's almost three hour running time did I check the time. It's thrilling, it's funny, it's clever, it's visually interesting and emotionally engaging. The story itself is really fairly straightforward: a bounty hunter (Christopher Waltz) frees a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), makes him his partner, and then agrees to help him free his slave wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's not the plot, but the characters that make the film so fresh and engaging. Django, although the titular character, is probably the least interesting in the film. He's strong and stoic in the tradition of Clint Eastwood, and it is great fun watching him dole out justice, but he doesn't get any of the good dialogue. Dr. King Schultz, Django's mentor, probably carries the first half of the film. He's charming, verbose, calculating, and equally capable of great compassion and ruthless violence, depending on which he seems to think the situation calls for.<br /><br />The film's second half belongs to the dual villains of DiCaprio's Calvin Candie, a ruthless psychopath masquerading as a southern gentleman, and his house slave/Svengali Steven (Samuel L Jackson). The juxtaposition of the two despicable characters together drive home a subtle point: that slavery wasn't just about race, but about the dark, ruthless nature of human beings to want to control, dominate and subjugate other human beings. As entitled and evil as Candie is, Steven is just as willing to go to abhorrent lengths to maintain the status quo, because the status quo has afforded him as much power and control over others as he could possibly be allowed in his position.alf belongs to the dual villains of DiCaprio's Calvin Candie, a ruthless psychopath masquerading as a southern gentleman, and his house slave/Svengali Steven (Samuel L Jackson).

0307477479|4.0|Loved my first read of Egan. It's been sitting beside the bed for too long. The passage of time is incredibly fluid in this one - and a theme itself. Thought the .ppt chapter was indulgent and confusing. Didn't do much for me.<br /><br />The rest of the story was great. Well worth the read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book and would recommend it BUT with the advice that the reader take time to enjoy the first 2/3rds of the book and not get too disappointed with the last 1/3.  I felt the ending was weak and I started disliking all the characters toward the end.  I give 5 stars to books when I find I &#34;miss&#34; the characters after I finish the last page.  These characters were loathsome.

B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Although there is plenty of humor (Tommy Lee Jones is fabulous) it is a serious movie about the disintegration of a marriage, and the wife's hope to bring it back to life. The couple were not made to look more attractive or younger than expected and home life could be pretty typical for some. Steve Carrell surprisingly was very good in his role. I thought it lagged in some parts; not sure why they needed the bar scene, maybe just to showcase Elizbeth Shue for 2 minutes. NOTE to continuity editor: You can't have Meryl frying ONE egg and then sliding TWO onto her husband's plate! Don't know how many noticed that, but such an easy correction. (I'm a stickler for fact checking.)

B004EPZ07K|2.0|I hate this type of movie, and don't get me wrong I'm a big DC fan. I just hate this type of movie. You got great actors, great special effects, a decent villain, and a hero that I would love to see again in another movie. What's wrong is that it's boring. This is the type of movie that I hate. Green Lantern is not a terrible movie, it's given so much that it has the potential to be a great movie. But on the other hand there is nothing for me to hate about this movie other than that it's boring. I'm stuck in the middle, can't decide whether I like this movie or hate it. I will say that I did not see a bad movie.<br /><br />Green Lantern is about a hero who police the galaxy of scum, and where was the setting? On freaking Earth! Green Lantern is a space opera like comic book hero, you set it in space where we see Hal Gordon beat the living pulp out of alien scum, not on Earth. Nothing big happens on Earth. If you love this movie and disagree with me, more power to you. I don't blame you, I see why you like this movie. It's just not for me.

1451695195|5.0|A very quick and fascinating read.  I thought there would be even more discussion about the science behind near-death-experiences (NDE) being that it is written by a scientist, but I guess much of that information still needs to be discovered, and that is the point the author seems to be making.  He wasn't able to adequately explain his experience with any current scientific theories, but he completely believes that the experience was real, and he believes that more research into various theories involving physics, biology, psychology, etc. would reveal greater truths about human consciousness.  It definitely sparked an interest in me to read more on the topic.  He provides numerous resources for further reading about what is already known and being studied regarding NDE's.  I also thought it was interesting that he never encountered Christ during his NDE, as many others with NDE stories do, but he definitely felt that he had met the all-powerful God and Creator of the universe.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|The picture quality was great. My husband wanted this for his collection and he was VERY pleased with this movie.

1419705849|5.0|My 8yr old loves this book, is very funny and keeps him quite entertained, he has taken this book to school and classmates have now become interested on the series.
0689815816|5.0|The phrase &#34;We're going on a bear hunt&#34; starts off each alternate page, and it describes how you can't go over it and you can't go under it, so you have to &#34;go through it&#34;-- followed by a page in full color that makes lots of sounds (e.g. squelsh!) as they move through that medium.<br /><br />The family of five (a father, mother, and three children) travel to a bear cave, and the story tells of what happens when they encounter a real bear! The pictures of their quick departure is my toddler (3 year old)'s favorite part, as she spots the bear in every panel, following them all the way home.<br /><br />Great sturdy board book, would recommend this to any parent!
0810989956|5.0|This has some clever ideas to not only express yourself but have fun at the same time. comes along with some jokes and other drawings that will definitely make you enjoy it and want to write your own story. My 8yr old sure likes the chance to draw his day to day stories as the books present it.

B00A77II0U|5.0|My 1st time playing an alawar game &amp; I just loved this one! the storyline was great &amp; the game was challenging w/o being stupid hard. Defiantly entertaining &amp; fun. I loved the lil &quot;doll&quot;! I would love 2 play another game like this!
B000086EOE|5.0|As a Genesis junkie, I needed something new ! The new twist that Steve Hackett<br />infused into the list of older standards was a breath of fresh air to me personally. My best to Steve for his efforts, thanks for giving this Genesis Fan something new,something old. Could more be coming .... hint, hint !
0553296981|3.0|My daughter was going to visit the Holecaust Museum and she was suppose to write about someone who went through the terror of the war and I felt that it would be a good idea if she read the Diary of Anne Frank.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|I don't care for Bella, I think she play the two guys against each other.  She uses Jacob when she needs him and then runs to Edward for love
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Everyone should have this movie in their personal collection. Perfect family movie & won't get tired of watching it over again. Great for Dad's and future grooms. Also has an book to go along with movie - get the book too!
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I've always liked this movie from the first time I saw it.  The music is great and young Depp puts on a performance like no one can.  I just can't get with the drinking of the teardrops.  Definitely recommended
B005H0IW6W|5.0|If you like Michael Buble, you must buy this album. If you like Christmas songs, you must buy this album. MB has, what my mother terms, an intimate voice, in that, he sings like he's singing to you and you alone. My faves include All I Want For Christmas Is You, which gives me goosebumps when I listen to it, and Cold December Night which was co-written by Michael Buble and his pianist. You won't be disappointed. With over 10 tracks, this is a proper Christmas album and is even better than his first.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a fantastic game, really imaginitive and simple, but also challenging and creative. This all adds up to a fun game.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Now my collection of X-Men is complete, and I really enjoy listening to James McAvoy every since he played in Wanted
0810994739|5.0|Expected it to look more &#34;used&#34;, but it looks like it was just bought from Barnes and Noble. My little brother jumped with great enthusiasm when he saw that it came in through the mail.  We are extremely pleased.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I love Hugh Jackman and the way he talks send chills down my back (Wolvern Always)! ! ! ! !
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book strayed a little from the typical Sparks novel.  There was danger and mystery with a villain.  He did a good job with the storytelling of the love affair and how the past affected it.  While it's not my favorite book by any means, I'd definitely recommend it...
078324228X|4.0|I feel this shows that police are not always right that they can make mistakes and that there are a few police that are not good people (corrupted) and that just because of them the good police have to work twice as hard.  Just like with the police all black people are not good nor are they all bad.  This movie showed me the story of a man who had to fight all his life and because of it and the color of his skin was seeked out by the bad cops because even if he made mistakes he turned his life around and made something of himself but some people just wanted to keep him down.  I bought this movie to show my child so she will see everyone is not your enemy nor your friend and that she needs to watch her back.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read EVERY book Michael Connelly has written, and the Black Box is one of the best.  I love Harry Bosch.  As usual, I felt emotionally involved with Harry and his trials.  My only disappointment was that the LT was not held more accountable for his treatment of Harry.  Great book .. I highly recommend it.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|My daughter loves Teen Wolf and buying this for her kept her off of my computer trying to download each episode now all I need is the other seasons as they are completed and I will forever be her hero.  If it makes my daughter this happy and knowing her friends I'm sure I would recommend this to another parent for their child.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a book about fighting against an oppressive regime as the heroine gets thrust back into the hunger games arena but with a big twist at the end. Revolution is in the air.
B0007TKNKG|3.0|I like this movie, my only problem is that the father just left his family because he couldn't get along with his father-in-law.  When you get married you marry the person not their family and if the person that you married can't understand that then you move on if all else fells.  His father did try and make a mends and come back into his life even though the grandfather practically brainwashed the boy but he learned at the end that everybody has to be held accountable for their own actions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the whole series. Engrossing adventure and easy read. Tale of oppression under a totalitarian regime that gets knocked out at the end by the heroine.
1574214276|4.0|Great basic book for starting Zentangle drawings.  This is the first book I purchases on Zentangles and thought it's a great place to start.  I like having the book so I can refer back to it and get some inspiration.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Although I have HBO and thought I saw all these shows, I'm so glad I ordered the complete series because there were quite a few that I didn't see when they aired nor when I tried to catch up with what I thought I missed on demand.  Excellent series.

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I've seen the new movie and it is boring as heck and not scary at all - at least to me.  With the original, I still jump during certain scenes.  Some things are better left alone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is addictive!  I'm so happy to be able to catch up and be ready for season three...  I have to ration myself to one or two episodes a day or would watch  the entire thing and have nothing to look forward to the next day.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I never saw this movie at the theater, but I purchased a full screen DVD version and absolutely love this movie. I have watched it countless times. Now I realize how lucky I was to get the full screen version. Recently, I borrowed a copy of the widescreen version from my local library just to see how much I was missing. For some reason, though, I didn't enjoy the widescreen version like I did the full screen version. I then used two computers to run both versions at once, cued at the same time, on side by side monitors and then it became glaringly obvious that the widescreen bars were cutting off immense amounts of important parts of the picture. Yes, the widescreen gives the wider shot, but most of composition of the focus of the scenes is not widescreen in nature, so you're not gaining a lot of important imagery from the widescreen format, but you are losing A LOT from the top and bottom that you get with the full screen format. This really surprised me. I've always assumed that widescreen versions were the full picture shown at the theaters. If the widescreen DVD version is the version shown on the big screen at the theater, then the theater audience missed a tremendous amount of the pleasure of watching this film. I have a hard time believing that this could be the case. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE VISUAL PLEASURE WITH THE FULLSCREEN VERSION. For instance, in the scene at Netherfield where Lydia asks Bingley to host a ball, in the shot of Bingley, Darcy, and Caroline, in the widescreen version, Caroline is cut off at the stomach by the lower bar, while on the fullscreen version of the same shot, you see her near fully sitting on the couch in a way that is very expressive for the scene. Frankly, I pity those who have only seen this movie on the widescreen DVD. What a great shame! How can this be? They don't know what they're missing and their appreciation of this film might be greatly improved by watching the fullscreen version.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|This is excellent! There are not too many old time Southern Rock n' Roll coming out these days.I would recommend this for all Skynynard fan!
B0057URWSQ|5.0|I've been looking around for my next 'favourite' tv show and this is it.<br /><br />Slick, smart and stylish, Suits manages to take an old formula and make it new and exciting again. I was hooked from the trailer, and finished the entire first season in 3 days.<br /><br />Script, acting, pacing, story lines, I'm trying to find something to criticise but I'm coming up bare.<br /><br />In summary - watch this show, you will not regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great end to a fabulous trilogy!<br />Want to read it all over again! Sad it is all over, time for something new.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Beautiful film with a thought provoking ending. Watch in 3D, the best I've seen since Avatar. Enjoyed it so much I have now ordered the book.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|This is a tough book to describe. It is at the very least controversial. I am try to think of good rebuttals, or am I?
B00A9X7X6C|5.0|I absolutely loved the plot. Yes, some moments do drag, but not enough to make me doubt how much I was going to enjoy the movie. If you saw the trailer, and thought it was awesome, then I'd definitely give this a shot. I found it worth my money anyway.
B0041OT9W6|1.0|I DO NOT recommend this book to those who must read an autobiography in school. She talks of her lady parts and its SERIOUSLY GROSS. Please don't read this version if you're squeamish. Overall only the afterwords part of the book captivated my attention.
B004UID2LC|3.0|its still a good app but it keeps shuting down, it doesnt have all the youtibe vidios,it has like have of it, im not a hater i just think they need to upgrade........alout! :p
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love story.  A real page turner. It was hard to put down after the first page.  Very beautifully written.
B006O6F932|5.0|It's rare for a child to want something for Christmas, get it, and then actually spend hours playing with it on Christmas day.  But that is exactly what happened.  She loved it.  She's seven.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|the first of this series is by far the best of the trilogy, this one moves way too fast and has a lot of cool gadgets, unfortunately you really must see the other two to understand this movie
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it is a very fun game. save your coins if you can but they do add up fast so you can buy familys faster.
B00992CF6W|1.0|DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!  I was playing it and my kindle fire died then when I played it again it reset!!! all my progress and my tools, gone DONT BUY IT!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I'm always leary of the G5 games because of the price, but this one was only 2.99. It was a very good game, just wish it had more playtime.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book reminds me of my daughter.  I cried at certain parts. If you have an autistic child,  this is a must-read.
B0063IH60K|1.0|After every shuffle of the cards an ad pops up (Kindle Fire) which is totally annoying. Who wants to play a game like that?
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Drowns out my husband's snoring every night!! My favorite is Cape Hatteras .... feels like I'm seaside even tho I'm in landlocked Colorado.  So many other soothing sounds to pick from also and a good alarm clock.  Best $1.99 ever spent!
0316212377|4.0|Another quality book from Mr Banks on the Culture universe. I liked that he used Subliming as a central aspect of the story and wove everything around that. I found it amusing that this is so even while the Culture itself sees Subliming as beneath them...:) I did find the ending a bit of a let down, content wise, but it reality, it was appropriate for the story. I recommend for seasoned readers of the Culture series, not for beginners. Good stuff!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This comes in handy when I want to escape. This is the best invention for things to do while taking a break.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I prefer BBC to U.S. network news and watch daily on PBS.  This Kindle version is well organized and effortless to skim or scan.  It gets to the point in a palatable form.
B009GEEMLY|2.0|I'm a massive fan of the super-hero genre and Marvel flicks but I found The Avengers to be long, tedious, and uninspiring. There was very little of the human element that made the Batman and Spiderman films so entertaining. There was almost no plot and minimal character development. It was pure action over substance.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I've seen a lot of chess apps spring up on iOS and Android, but most of them are dreadful because they have bad navigation and extremely small, distinguishable pieces. This app is easily the best of them all. The pieces are distinguishable, the menus are nice with smooth animations, and the chess AI is fluent and extremely hard to beat at Level 10. Overall, this is hands-down the best chess app there is on Android.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Love this case.  It looks very nice and professional.  The case is soft and is easy to hold.  The case supports my Kindle Fire when I prop it up with the back.  Definitely a good purchase!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is one of the first games to hit absolute popularity in the mobile gaming market, and it's still as good as ever. The ads don't bother you and even if you hate them, you can turn off WiFi when playing the game. There are a lot of levels and it's entertaining for literally all age groups, so there's no harm in downloading this. Excellent game.
B009GED3HS|5.0|season 8 was great! i have no complaints. all episodes came through without any issues. i enjoyed watching it very much.
1451695195|3.0|Neither a good or bad read. I was trying to judge the credibility of the Author the entire time that I was reading the book, and my final conclusion is that I just can't tell. I am interested in this topic because I have had a near death experience, so I always try to compare my own experience with stories I hear from others. However, the authors description of what he saw on the other side, was cloudy to me. I found myself trying to re-read paragraphs at a time in order to try and imagine what he was trying to describe. Most of the book was this way, and ultimately I walked away feeling like the book was an overall disappointment. Although, trying to describe a dimension that is unlike anything any human being has ever experienced, could be challenging....perhaps like an artist trying to paint a rainbow with only black paint. So I applaud his valiant attempt, and feel that this is just a book that will resonate with some readers, and fail to inspire others.
B000ZELISO|3.0|I bought it I got it but unfortunately had ordered the wrong one, not realizing it until I had open the plastic wrap...Amazon was very good about helping replace the movie...thank you.
0756407125|1.0|Did not enjoy very tedious,one of the most boring books i've ever read.How did It get to be a best seller did not finish it
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Lets you do video and photos and it is easy to learn.  Fun for all ages and abilities.  A good choice.
0756405890|1.0|This is one of the worst books i've read,couldn't finish it as with the other book in the series.Will not be reading from this author again!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Really cool because it lets you listen to songs, overs levels of play including beginner, apprentice and expert, wide variety of songs.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|When I uograded my phone to Jelly bean, the app suddenly would not work - I contacted the developer who was very respectful & he was working on an upgrade - he fixed the problem and now it is even better than before - I love puzzle games and jewelry match and this game is both - very unique as well. I can't wait to beat it again :-)
B007JMW46U|5.0|If you have a kindle, its free, its a great collection of tales and something everyone should read if they have the time/opportunity.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Very average shoot everyone, kill everyone movie.  Worth the rental fee.  One guy taking out the entire planets army is a bit hard to believe.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Still one of the greatest movies ever made.  Robert Redford is awesome and so handsome in this movie!  Highly recommend for anyone who loves a great love story.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|Very interesting read, if you love the guild wars franchise you would love reading this book.<br /><br />The story really helps set up the tension between the different races and really dives into the world and culture of each race.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Lots of fun.and it's free!  Just did the beginner but still enjoyed it! Always wanted to play the piano ! ! !
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Such great apps!  My daughter spends as much time as I'll let her on my kindle styling each character's hair.  Too cute!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|About as realistic as it gets when couples get older. Basically the wife wants help for not communicating and the husband can't understand what the heck is wrong with the way things are & thinks she's a little loonie for wanting things to change.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Another happy Hollywood movie with another happy Hollywood ending. It was funny. A few over the line Family Guy type jokes thrown in along the way.
B0084P9202|4.0|Indeed, I would take this over many of the other albums released this past year--even in previous years. However, if you're waiting for Sigur Rós to leave us gob smacked, as they have in the past, take a seat by me. Great music from a great composer/performer doesn't always produce magic. Nevertheless, you'll find it perfect background music for napping, cooking, doing home repairs, or painting seascapes.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|This was ok but not nearly as good as his others.  Honestly I had forgotten that I read it and had to look it up.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not awful. I wish there was not  of a plot. Very predictable. A a a a a a a a
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really don't get how this series is getting a movie, I think it is ridiculous.  They are well written though.
0783231032|5.0|This movie is a christmas classic! A must-see during the holidays. The jaws scene at the beginning of the movie was great, and we love the story line. It's going in the annual rotation and will add to our enjoyment of the season.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This was a stupid series and I honestly don't get it.  I didn't even finish this one and will not order the third.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Arguably the greatest of American films, Orson Welles's 1941 masterpiece, made when he was only 26, still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion: people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. Written by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz, and photographed by Gregg Toland, the film is the sum of Welles's awesome ambitions as an artist in Hollywood. He pushes the limits of then-available technology to create a true magic show, a visual and aural feast that almost seems to be rising up from a viewer's subconsciousness. As Kane, Welles even ushers in the influence of Bertolt Brecht on film acting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind work, and in many ways is still the most modern of modern films from the 20th century. --Tom Keogh
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|Just your average animated Disney musical.  Not amazing, but not bad, it was good entertainment for the plane ride I had to take.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|One of my favorite kids movies (and with a 5 year old and 19 month old I have seen a lot!). Visually it is spectacular (I wish i would have bought the blu-ray) and with a good message. I never read the book so do not know how it compares.
B005HSL626|3.0|it would be a fun game if it didn't keep crashing every time I play the arcade version! otherwise, its a pretty fun game.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I love movies about the little miracles in daily life and if your open to them it can change your life!  This movie is enjoyable, enter<br />taining,  and restores your faith when you follow your heart.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in the film. Did not find it as funny as I found the trailer. Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought for my daughter and she loves the lifeproof case for her iphone!!! Its definitely worth it for teenagers...
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Great music! Good selection of songs. Clear quality music. The download was fast and easy and I now have it in my amazon cloud.
B009CG29RK|5.0|This is one of my favorite children's movies. Everyone in my home loves it and we all laugh and laugh.
B008476HBM|4.0|Great classic, couldn't put it down. I liked being able to read it on my kindle. Finding some of the old classics sometimes can be difficult. I like the fact that I can find these through amazon.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|BORING<br />Very, very BORING I am only writing this because these people want more words good bye very, very BORING peoples
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Book that Brings you in from the very beginning! It was a fast read I couldn't put it down!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I think I like the first season a little better than the 2nd season here, but perhaps I only got used to the characters. I wasn't expecting a different plot, and characters for the 2nd season. This season takes place in an asylum, which seems like it could be creepier - however the first season seemed like they had a better edge on the creepy factor. Season 2 offers some of the actors to take on new characters and really show a range. It's hard to say much without spoilers.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto's new character for this season is better than his role in the first season. I'm looking forward to see what they do for season 3.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|This is my type of film, let me tell you that first, but this film is for anyone who loves good music, fun and a GREAT performance. Being a huge fan of great ROCK music, I knew all the songs and sang along. I stopped signing the second Tom Cruise appeared as Stacee Jaxx. I am a former Cruise fan and I was shocked at how much I loved him in this film. He's greasy and slimey in all the right ways. He's every hot lead singer in any rock band plus a scuz bucket rolled into one. I obsessed with Tom and Stacee Jaxx. I listen to the soundtrack all the time!<br />Watch Rock of Ages, cause there &#34;ain't nothin' like a good time&#34;
B008M36EEI|4.0|Great feel good movie! Very nice character development. Understood and felt the chemistry and conflict between characters. Love the added dry humor. Well done!!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I didn't really want to see this film, but once I did, I was in total hysterics. As a life long teddy bear lover, I figured I'd be offended by the tash talking Ted, but I wasn't. This movie was sweet, fun, hysterically funny, offensive, and just a good time. Buy it. Laugh. Watch it again. Laugh some more. You won't be sorry.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm on my second round of this game. My only complaint the first time was running out of new games. Great way to waste time. Highly recommended. A++ I'm looking forward to starting over.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I loved this movie! The actors and the singing was great! I thought it was really cool how they didn't use any instruments when they sang, just their voices. I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this app. my friend had it and I had to download it. Lot's of challenges and every game is different
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I just got the app and I &lt;3 it! I love how you can post your personal pictures on there!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My 6 year old loves this game as much as I do.  It takes a little getting used to in the beginning, then you're hooked just like the old Angry Birds.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|For the price these Mics are more than enough for what I need. I would recommend them to everyone I know.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard!!  If you love folky music that includes some brass and a wonderful haunting lead duo this is the band for you.  My Head is an Animal has quickly become one my favorite albums.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  More hype than substance..Amy was psychotic and got away with everything, really!!!!!!!! Not believable.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Great well built knife, came sharp out of the box. Seems to keep it's edge well but also harder to get it sharp again but that expected. Did have one little ding in the back of the blade but for the price I would diffidently recommend it.<br /><br />Cons<br />Would have given it a 5/5 but the sheath snap was put on backward so now it's a lot harder to snap and get's hooked on things.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I have read most of Brandon Sanderson's books. He is a genius at creating new worlds. This book is no exception. It is a great story. Just wish it was longer. I am hoping for more books in this world.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very fun game. The only thing I would say about it is that I wish that there were more coins or a place where you could buy them free with the prints that you earn. But all in all, great game and I recommend it very much!

B0018QPPXW|5.0|Risky Business accurately portrays a difficult and stressful time in a young man's life. This film really captures the stress of school and getting accepted by a good college, dealing with sexual frustration and peer pressure - all while trying to get out from underneath your parents' scrutiny. Tom Cruise nailed the part, and there are many great supporting actors as well, not to mention the beautiful young Rebecca de Mornay. I'm not a huge fan of the soundtrack, but I have to remind myself of the music scene when this movie was released. Risky Business is a classic, and I highly recommend it. Enjoy!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Good book. It makes you think of the future of sameness... I'll be buying gathering blue next. Can't wait!!!<br />Awesome
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I would  highly recommend this product to a friend or family member.  It was worth the money.  can't wait till season 3 is released
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss isn't your everyday girl. She acts like a parent but still has somewhat of a teenager's feelings. This naturally changes as her inner conflict starts to become more dominant in everything she does throughout the book. It was a survival instinct with teenager hormones mixed in slightly. For the reader age, it was great, but I do wish the ending was a bit better. That's why they have sequels, though, right?
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It isn't often that someone creates a truly original adventure.  I love everything about this game, from the initial drawing of my stickperson to the drawing of the friend that is to be rescued.  If you get really stuck there is a hint for each level to get you started.  (At least for the levels I've done so far.)  This is one of the most creative games I've played in a long time!  I totally recommend this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was good its the best book I read in awhile!Hopefully  others like it as well as I do!Great Book
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Love the movie,  Price was right.  Arrived very quickly.  A good movie for girls who wish their mother would change (not be so strict) and about strong female.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Other than a great read, I had no idea what I was getting into with this book.  I am a huge fan of Slammed and Point of Retreat and would read the dictionary if Colleen Hoover wrote it.  The summary listed is all true, but does not get into the meat of the story, which is a good thing.  I knew reading that there would be some major plot twist, everything was leading to it, and I had several ideas in mind, but I didn't get all of it.  I'm glad I didn't - the effect was devastating.  In a good way, if course.<br /><br />I LOVE these characters.  Holder is pretty much close to the perfect guy, in my humble opinion.  He is totally the guy I would have fallen for in high school.  I love that he is careful with his words, as if he has a limit to how many he can use each day.  That reminded me a lot of myself actually (hooray for introverts!).  I also loved Sky and thought she had a great sense of humor and for someone who'd been in the dark a long time, a great sense of self.  The connection between the two is magical and it was so great to eavesdrop on how they fell in love.  And OMG the first kiss that wasn't is maybe the most intimate scene in a book I've read all year.  And that's all I will say about that, you'll need to read it for yourself.<br /><br />Being a child of the 80′s and 90′s, this reminded me ever so slightly of a beloved series by Caroline B. Cooney, but this story is totally its own.  The emotions experienced by the characters are so intense, I felt like I was there, crying sweating and loving right with them.  I am a little sad I've read it already, because I'd like to be able to experience it again for the first time.  I'll settle for pushing it on all my friends!<br /><br />If you love a good story, you will love this.  If you love Colleen Hoover, you will love her even more.  I've said love a lot here, haven't I?  Read it.  You won't regret it.  This was the last book I read in 2012 and it made for one heck of an ending!<br /><br />5/5
0345452585|2.0|I used to read Jonathan Kellerman's books pretty regularly, but stopped buying them as they came out--more because of budgetary restrictions than anything else. They were always pretty good, but not good enough to make me keep up with them when money was tight. That being said, I've had two of his books on my bookshelves for quite awhile and thought it was time I got around to reading one of them.<br /><br />The Conspiracy Club is a stand-alone novel from Bellman, who departs from his Alex Delaware series to introduce Jeremy Carrier. Jeremy is a psychologist who is half-heartedly getting back on his feet following the recent murder of his girlfriend. The police have never identified her killer and have not ruled him out as a suspect. When other women start to disappear as well, Jeremy finds himself under additional scrutiny by the detective in charge of his girlfriend's case. While this is going on, Jeremy receives an invitation to dine with an exclusive group of individuals who he discovers have each experienced a similar unresolved loss in their past and who have an intense interest in the nature of evil.<br /><br />The Conspiracy Club was a decent book, but nothing special. The story takes a while to become engaging and Kellerman's attempt to shake things up with a little twist at the end left me inimpressed and ready to move on to the next book on the shelf.
0143118757|5.0|This is a great book. I wish I could follow every tip on every page. Very useful advice and easy reading.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I feel this should have been packed with the orginal kindle fire when bought. Since i use it with my computer to download.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|That feature alone would make me give it five stars, but it just so clear as well.  I'm not sure if the refresh rate is really, but the remote experience from the desktop is absolutely fluid. i recommend using the touchpad interface to control the mouse which turns your screen into a mock touchpad for controlling the mouse.  Better than teamviewer, windows RDP, and logmein and I've tested all of those fully.  Now, if I could just get my office to not block this on their firewall I would be good to go.

B0044DEAUA|2.0|Updated 1/22/2013:  My first unit quit after two weeks.  I started to get extremely loud static using my iPhone 5, and it even interfered with my other bluetooth devices working properly.  The replacement does not have the loud static, but the sound quality is not as good as the first.  Both units were properly charged.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />The bluetooth unit is attached to the visor via a strong magnet.  However, when I press any button while mounted, it falls off because the magnet is not strong enough.<br /><br />Other than that the unit works well.  However, I've noticed that it works better with iPhones than with my BlackBerry.  Also, I haven't been able to successfully connect two phones at the same time.  While I can pair each phone with the bluetooth, only one of the phones will activate the speaker.<br /><br />Everyone I've spoken to says the voice quality is great.  The speaker on my end is pretty good.<br /><br />Some reviewers says that the USB charging port should be on the side and not the back, because that would enable the user to charge the unit while mounted.  I don't feel the unit can be charged while mounted (even if the port was on the side), because the magnet is not strong enough to hold it up while plugged in.<br /><br />I still think this is a good product for the price, so long as you are pairing only one iPhone.  However, I will not give it as a present because the controls are not intuitive.  I'm still looking for an easy to use speaker to give to my family members.

B0094AH3NE|3.0|I Masnadieri was staged in San Carlo two years after the world premiere in London in 1849 for a run of 14 performances and never again until this production from March 2012. The opera was rarely performed until a successful concert performance by the Opera Orchestra of New York in 1975 and the issue of a Philips recording with Bergonzi, Caball&eacute;, Cappuccilli and Raimondi, conducted by Lamberto Gardelli. Bonynge conducted it at the Sydney Opera House in 1980 and recorded it for Decca in 1982 with his late wife.<br /><br />According to the blu-ray's book this blu-ray was compiled from all 5 performances in the run. Nicola Luisotti was recently appointed music director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, and this production is the first he conducted since his appointment. Gabriele Lavia, a well-known Italian director of high repute, as well as an actor, directed it. He is considered a 'specialist' of Schiller's text \\"Die R&auml;uber\\" on which the libretto is based - he directed it (and played the role of Carlo) in a successful 1982 production that toured several Italian towns, and has recently directed a group of young actors in another staging seen in several Italian theatres. He also recently directed this play in one of the major theatres in Rome. In 1986 he produced this opera in Pisa, Lucca and Livorno. So this production of the Teatro San Carlo has generated considerable interest and has attracted fans from all over Italy.<br /><br />In this staging the entire opera takes place in a single ugly space, possibly an abandoned contemporary theater stage with exposed lighting apparatus, projectors everywhere, or a space in an urban ghetto in Harlem or the Bronx with a broken roof, scattered debris and dead leaves . Colorful graffiti and murals (\\"city painting\\") \\"decorate\\" the brick walls; in the background is a large skull with the words  \\"libert&agrave; o morte\\" spread out. The libretto needs all the help it can get but setting all the action in the same space doesn't clarify the story and is confusing. The ugly costumes are a puzzling hodgepodge. The principal characters are in late-nineteenth-century style; the all male chorus of the masnadieri is in some kind of gangsters' style with leather coats and hats in matching and mismatching styles - from cylinder to bowler hats; the guests of Francesco party in punk or in cheap party wigs and Halloween costumes. There is a jarring mismatch between the postmodern sets and costumes on the one hand, and the acting characterized by conventional melodramatic operatic poses on the other hand. It creats some risible dramatic situations. There is a pervasive poverty of ideas on how the characters should interact or how the chorus should move on stage. Relationships are not clarified. It looks like the director just threw in the towel on the stupid libretto. It is depressing to watch this unrelenting and baffling ugliness for two hours with no change of scenes (or to watch close-ups of the soprano's heavy perspiration).<br /><br />The four principals and the choir respond better to the conductor than to the director. Tenor Aquiles Machado as Carlo has a true sense of the Verdi style. His delivery is incisive, involved, with emotions clearly projected and lines beautifully shaped and articulated. He is a lyric singing a dramatic role here, but everyone has been singing up a vocal fach for years now (a fach or two: I just learned that J. D. Florez is to take up Arnold in Guglielmo Tell! A tenore di grazia!). The role of Amalia was created for Jenny Lind, the Swedish dramatic coloratura soprano and was written to display her particular strengths. It therefore requires considerable coloratura agility, facility with the fioriture but also dramatic power of projection. Soprano Ana Lucrecia Garc&iacute;a has all of these in spades. She has a pretty stunning technical capability (trills are inconsistent, though) and a full, gorgeous tone. Verdi has a way of somehow \\"announcing\\" in the beginning of a singer's part the special challenge or requirement of a role. Here he put a few bars into Amalia's first appearance a quickly ascending scale that sounds completely out of context in that spot other than to immediately announce his expectations (or allow the soprano to immediately dazzle?). Garc&iacute;a executes it perfectly and effortlessly, touching each note (rather than just gliding over the notes as C. used to do...). This is a sign of things to come in the rest of Garc&iacute;a's elegant assumption of the role. She is still very young and has a way to go to acquire that artistic intelligence that goes with the individuality of expression of more experienced divas. No comments about the rest of the cast or the chorus.<br /><br />This opera is like a bullet train: the score has no digressions or redundancies and the story, with its grimness and aggression once started, goes forward directly without hesitation to its absurd end. Nicola Luisotti captures this breathless pulse of the score with rhythmic vitality, dramatic vivacity, urgency of expression and superbly calculated rallentandos and rubatos in its more lyrical and introspective moments. The orchestra plays for him in a state of grace with clear sonorities and balance between various orchestral sections. Luisotti is the real star of this production.<br /><br />Blu-ray technical quality is fine in terms of video quality and sound. The singers are body miked. I noticed that performances where the singers are body miked sound better on headphones. The advantage of good speakers over even the best headphones is the soundstage they provide, but body mics kill the soundstage anyway. Sound engineers deconstruct the sound to a gazillion tracks and reconstruct some artificial mix according to their skills, preferences and available time. With body mics the result is sterile. This is another example of the maxim that the more toys sound engineers have available to play with the worse the outcome. There are (for now) clips from the production on youtube. You can get a glimpse of the gorgeous interior of the recently renovated San Carlo during the credits.he special challenge or requirement of a role.

B007N5YJWK|5.0|The recent (2012) Criterion Collection's release of Hitchcock's \\"The 39 Steps\\" gives a much needed boost to the Master's epochal movie, which may have been overshadowed by the \\"high power\\" American movies that he started with his move to Hollywood in 1939. As many have noted, this film forehadows many of the themes that became more distinctive--and more pronounced--with the plethora of movies made in Hollywood in the next two decades, one being the theme of the chase. An innocent man is accused of murder and pursued relentlessly by both law agents and lawless elements, and he has to use his ready wit, cunning and daring to discover a secret as to save his life. This movie lasts only 86 minutes, but its pacing makes it possible for the man, Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) to escape a dozen traps lying on his path, to fall in love with a woman he meets casually on a train (fast forward, \\"North by Northwest\\"), and to unravel a secret buried in the mind of a Vaudeville performer, and deliver the villain spies to the police. Breathless action, clever twists, a casual meeting with a good woman (Peggy Ashcroft in her youth), romance in a hotel room chained to his love interest--all those elements bear the stamp of Hitchcock early brilliance. The package comes with the obligatory Criterion booklet, and an audio commentary by Hitchock scholar Marian Keene, and many other features that embelish this elegant and informative Blu-ray edition. Only complain: the video is a bit blurry and the scenes filmed in misty Scoland landscape (or in the studio substitutes) are a bit annoying. But the whole is a delight--superb entertainment.

B0046ECFRM|5.0|le sigh...<br /><br />I wanted to make sure that my first book in 2013 was a fun happy read and I am pleased to say that Anna and the French Kiss was exactly that. The setting was lovely, the characters were fun and the overall book was just a joy to read. This is the third book in the last month that I have read that takes place in Paris and I am dying to return there now. I obviously missed tons of places I should have gone to the first time.<br /><br />\\"Welcome to Paris, Anna. I'm glad you've come.\\"<br /><br />Anna finds herself being forced by her father to spend her senior year of high school in Paris. While others would jump at the chance Anna doesn't fancy the idea at all. She is very closed off and is scared of even leaving the dorms for the first couple of weeks. Thankfully she meets the girl in the room next to hers, Meredith, who introduces Anna to her group of friends. There is Josh and Rashmi who are a couple and &Eacute;tienne (Eh-t-yen) St. Clair. aaahhhh &Eacute;tienne St. Clair *swoon* What a wonderful character. St. Clair (as his friends call him) is unfortunately dating another friend of the group, Ellie, but she graduated the year before and now that she is in college has stopped hanging around them all. It is always St. Clair who goes to visit her as her college is nearby.<br /><br />Slowly Anna and St. Clair get closer and closer and you can see a real friendship building. Then you can see that friendship turning into romantic feelings. Since St. Clair has a girlfriend and Anna has a boy back home that she is hoping will wait for her... they have to navigate their feelings without hurting the others in their lives.<br /><br />\\"There are few things worse than having feelings for someone you shouldn't, and I don't like where my thoughts were headed.\\"<br /><br />I really enjoyed the chemistry between Anna and &Eacute;tienne. It is a tricky situation in a book when one of the characters is dating somebody else because I would never condone cheating. But thankfully Perkins was able to write the story in a way that the relationship was gradual and no real lines were crossed. I never felt uncomfortable with what was happening and of course you are wishing for them to end up together so really a few blurred lines are acceptable.<br /><br />\\"So what do I wish for? Something I'm not sure I want? Someone I'm not sure I need? Or someone I know I can't have? Screw it. Let the fates decide.<br /><br />I wish for the thing that is best for me.\\"<br /><br />This was my first book by Stephanie Perkins but I do plan on reading her others. Lola and the Boy Next Door is out now and Isla and the Happily Ever After is due out in May 2013. Isla is actually in Anna and the French Kiss so it will be nice to visit that character again. From what I can tell from the synopsis it appears all of the characters from these three books are somehow connected yet it doesn't appear to be a true trilogy. So it may be okay to read them as a standalone or as a series.<br /><br />oooOOOooohhhh and I just wanted to add... this is one book that I would love to be rewritten from &Eacute;tienne's point of view. There are so many times when he is away with his girlfriend, Ellie, and it would be nice to see how their relationship starts to change as his friendship with Anna grows. It would be a little hard in the start seeing him happy with Ellie but then again he can't have been that happy... not really...<br /><br />\\"Is it possible for home to be a person and not a place?\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readserkins was able to write the story in a way that the relationship was gradual and no real lines were crossed.

B009GZKO2O|4.0|I will simply comment on the current two reviews.  I have no problem with Netrebko's performance.  In fact, I was swept away by her earlier performance under de Billy, who pushed the production with a contagious urgency.  To some extent I miss that vitality in this current version, but in listening to Gatti's conducting I am impressed by the way he brings out the lyric aspects of the score--and this is a very lyric opera.  I am frequently struck by the shear beauty of the music, perhaps more often than when listening to De Billy.  I just listen, and so never bother to watch these Blu-ray operas, so I can't say anything about what is going on outside of the singer's mouths.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Overall this was a good ending for the series. There are a couple of cheesy moments but nothing so over the top that it ruins the experience.

My 4 year old son who wasn't really aware of these types of issues is now bringing it up and initiating conversations with us. Besides the good message behind it, it's a very well made movie that keeps a child's attention and that an adult can enjoy watching along.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Warning spoilers!<br />I really liked Bare to You but this book just disappointed me so much I wish I hadn't read it. There are just so many things wrong with it that it shocks me that so many people rate it so highly. The characters are ruined for me in this book.<br />I loved Gideon from the first book and was impressed that he rose above his horrible childhood to build his empire, that he learned to bend and adjust for Eva, that he would go to therapy and took drugs so he could sleep with her, that he would put up with her insecurity and chased her every time she ran. It is then so disappointing that in this book that he would resort to murder right away. For someone of his intelligence and wealth, surely there are other options that he could try first? Calculated murder before even trying anything else is just insane.<br />As for Eva, I liked her in the first book that she would rise above her fear and continued to sleep with him even after the first attack, encouraged him to go to therapy and loved him. In this book however, she's behaving no better than a dog in heat, groping him at dinner with his friend, having sex at concert, crawling to him for scrap even though she thinks he's back with Corinne.<br />This book is just sad!

B00633W614|4.0|I totally enjoy all of his books. Can't wait for the next book on the Clifton family.  All his books have twists and turns you don't expect. He is really a great story teller
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Fun movie....love Meryl Streep.NIce change from movies with lots of explicit language, etc.  Light, fun comedy. Would recommend it to anyone.
0802473156|5.0|I have read this book and passed it on to other people. It is a good tool to help improve communication and how to express love toward others in a way that they will feel it.
B002ZIAC4O|4.0|I love this album - Four Tet's music is progressive, involving, and uplifting.  The dance beats, however, could have been emphasized: What dance music there is pulls and energizes in a way that makes the rest of the album a tad droll.  That is not to say those individual tracks are lacking in quality; they are great pieces as well.  It's just that the album does not carry its momentum flawlessly and is a little confused.
0525478817|1.0|Read this book if you are a tween girl, otherwise you will regret it. I'm not saying it's bad, for tween girls I'm sure it's great, but to me it was just melodramatic with an abundance of \\"likes\\" and \\"umms.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The character of Katniss is so well developed and easily relatable. The imagery is beautiful, especially the Capital and all the people in it. That girl is tougher than she realizes and yet so believable as a young teen confused about life and feelings and emotions. Seriously loved this book, couldn't put it down!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding monsters is a really cool slide puzzle game. The story is cute, the monsters are cute, and despite how childish it looks, the levels are challenging as you get  through. I recommend it for all ages!!!!!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|We love Wall-E, and it seems anyone that sees it does. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with kids wanting to expand their movie collection. Its definately my favorite newer Disney film.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|you have to watch this movie before purchasing the soundrack.  The songs on this soundtrack go perfectly with the movie scenes.  Have all of the original songs from the artists, it is nice to hear the movie versions.  The actors and actresses did a great job on the vocals.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This Tinkerbelle movie is a hit with my daughters, they love it. As with all Tinkerbelle movies, they aren't smash hits, just cute movies for kids to enjoy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series! A beautiful and compelling story of family, love, and relationships that captured our hearts. My husband and I were so entranced by it, that we watched the whole series New Years Eve and New Years Day.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My whole family enjoys Taylor.<br />When we are in the car, we all agree and listen to this together. I never get tired of listening to her.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Wonderful app! Puts me out like a light. Amazing for a free app. It has lots of sounds to choose from and they are very relaxing. An insomniac's must-have.
0547848412|5.0|Martel's novel completely met my expectations for its creativity and ability to make reader reflect on life and existence. I look forward to more of his work.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but, I must say, it felt like a rip off from \\" sleeping with the enemy\\" It's well written and has a good plot. Nicholas, once again, has out-done himself! I was just slightly disappointed with the lack of originality.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Beautiful music from start to finish! Sometimes you just need to play it and think of Mr Darcy and Elizabeth.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is great. It's not at all cheesy like some romantic books. It keeps a good pace and once you start reading it you won't stop.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Couldn't put it down, can't wait for the next book. From the first page it never drags constantly keeping you hooked.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Definitely took my breath away I couldn't stop reading it. I love it<br />Juicy book it will surprise you.<br />\\"f***all  the firsts, Sky. The only thing that matter to me with you are the forevers\\" \\"HOPELESS\\"
B00005N6KG|5.0|I had two pairs of the MDR-W08s for at least 6 years, maybe more.  I use them solely in my laptops when I don't want to disturb my wife.  They are perfect.  She doesn't hear anything, even when the sound is cranked and she is next to me in bed, trying to sleep.  Oh yeah, I also take them when I travel for use in airports and planes.  No probs there, either.  They feel very good, and I don't really notice that I am wearing them.  The cable is excellent.  Just the right length so that I can turn my head or lean away from the computer to reach for something.  The cable is very light, yet doesn't get tangled, ever.  After 6 years of plugging and unplugging, both headphones started to cut out, due to the wires going into the plug apparently breaking or shorting.  It was interesting that they both started to go within a month of each other.  Given the frequency of use and the fact that I often used them in bed, with the laptop sitting on a pillow which tipped and swayed, putting different kinds of pressure and stress on the plug, I accept this as something that one can normally expect to happen over such a long time.  I am ordering two new ones today and figure they'll also last about six years.  By the way, the sound is excellent, including the bass, which is quite clear.
B00063F8B2|3.0|Far too much of this score (6 songs) can be found elsewhere and far more of Silvestri's majestic score should have been on this CD.  The original songs are a mixed bag, with Tyler's \\"Rockin' On Top of the World\\" being a blast, Groban's \\"Believe\\" being hauntingly appealing, but somewhat shakily performed and the kids' \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\" being very cliched and overly sweet.<br /><br />A pity that this score was just what I expected, but those compiling it should have taken a lesson from the highly successful CD from \\"Home Alone\\" and presented a REAL soundtrack, not this hodge-podge.
B009CPES4I|5.0|In the day of giant blockbusters lies a wonderfull story.No playing with the volumn button or sanity busting moments. Just a colorfull back drop for a grand presentation of acting skills and dialect. A feel good movie with out all the phony sugar.<br />The cast was perfect and honest. I needed this escape and  discovered Best Marigold at a low moment and gave me the lift I needed
1419705849|5.0|My son LOVES all these books and movies, we always have to have the newest one so this is a nice addition to the series.
B0015AARJI|5.0|EXCELENTE PRODUCTO; 100% ORIGINAL ERA LO QUE ESPERABA, TODOS LOS ACCESORIOS PERFECTOS TOTALMENTE COMPLACIDO CON EL PRODUCTO GRACIAS ME GUSTO MUCHO...
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I like Amazon Instant Viewing. The price is reasonable by the season and downloading to watch is simple. I enjoy the humor in the Castle series, and the characters are well-developed. Solving the mysteries is fun. Amazon sends us an e-mail when each new episode is available, which is helpful.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|While I was hoping for something more I am sorry to say it did not come. This is a 159 minute movie that should have been a 93 minute movie. If not for Bruce Willis would have tuned it off after the first fifteen minutes. Save your money and wait for a really good movie.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Its an interesting app but somewhat unresponsive. I tried a few songs. I'll probably uninstall it unless there is some breakthrough update.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love the book that is all i can say.so plz dont ask again<br />why i told you how i feel about the book and the movie
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It was a great app. You should definitely download this app because it is a very exciting and creative game!
B000AMJC2K|2.0|The spring loaded button that allows you to raise or lower a pc screen doesn't work very well but it does easily swivel from side to side.  It will securely hold a decent sized monitor.  I attached mine to a work station using screws driven directly into the wood.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Great classic feel rock album.<br /><br />Slash is excellent and the vocals from Myles are awesome.  I heard &#34;Standing in the Sun&#34; and think it's the best song on the album, nice lyrics as well.  The rest of the album does not disappoint either.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really love this game. There's a lot of suspense in this game :)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend this game to anyone that love's a great mystery.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|A friend recommended this game and I thought it was a neat premise. Then I got to use the fire crayon and burn down forests and bunnies. AWESOME!
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is easy to play, fun for children and adults. Best of all its free, worth the download in my opinion :)
0767802519|5.0|This is one of those movies which is a must see ,lots of action,AND Natalie Portman is kinked out !!!!!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I know this is a free game but it was way too many ads that pop up all the time. I deleted it off my kindle.
0525952926|4.0|Though the story was very readable and poignant I did have some difficulty keeping up with the many characters as the story flowed from one to another. In the end I forgot who was related to who and found myself flipping over some of the paragraphs. That said it brought the past to life and one couldn't help but feel great sympathy for the people involved in those terrible times.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is easy to play, fun for children and adults. Best of all its free, worth the download in my opinion.
B00APUU7S0|1.0|Bruce Willis and Segourney Weaver were used to get some name recornition to an otherwise unknown cast of B grade actors. The story is so muddled that it is hard to follow. Good guys? Who the hell knows in this movie. Really bad dialog and action scenes that haven't been used for years. Imagine getting shot in the side and then after the bullet is removed by a dancer it is cauterized with a red hot spoon. One day later you are ina motorcycle wreck and the first place you rub is your head? Not once did this guy even acknowlege his prior wound. One million rounds fired with no one getting hit unless the plot calls for a direct one shot hit. Avoid this movie!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I'm sure it's a huge surprise that if you liked this show on MTV you'll love it all over again on DVD.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book was ok.  It wasn't written very well and it was difficult to read.  I didn't agree with her values.  Easy read, but ok.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great way to organize and plan using bookmarks. It fun, addictive, and useful. I use it mostly to keep track of all my favorite recipes.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Reading this book on my Kindle Fire is great fun.  Victor Hugo has an interesting style. I'm waiting to see where this all leads.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim consistently manages to think outside of the box and write brilliant books.  4 hour chef is no exception.  This book is packed full of USEFUL cooking information, recipes, general cooking how-to, and also includes some highlights from his other books, and is really enjoyable.  There are about 3 or 4 cooking pro-tips in this book that will blow your mind (how to read / rewrite recipes and measure ingredients were my fave's).  A must read.<br /><br />I highly recommend 4 hour body along with this book.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love Mahjong. This is one of my favorite games because I do not need a partner to play. Great fun.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  That's all I can say.  I have watched this dvd a million times, or at least it seems like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As heart wrenching a love story as there ever was written. Plenty of action and drama kept the pages turning.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|This is my favorite show of all times and I watch it all the time.  I love Sons of Anarchy.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Much like Childish Gambino, it's refreshing to have some rap about real life.  I'm not from the hood (like 99% of rappers who claim to be) and have no interest in living that life.<br /><br />Beats are great and music is fresh.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Love second 2 of Breaking Bad.  I never watched it when it was on cable.  I love the series and will be getting all five dvds.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you like graphic sexual descriptions this book is good.  I kept on reading it and the 2 sequels as I was really interested to see how the psychology between the two lead characters was working out.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It may not the best animation movie I've seen, as it's not as spectacular and imaginative as Toy Story or full of funny action like The Incredibles, but it's very enjoying.<br />If you like animation movies, watch this one. You'll have a few good laughs.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|Totally forgettable and not worth 3 cents, much less what it cost to rent.  Most of the cast should gracefully retire.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved everything about the movie. It's quite a long movie, but time flew by and I enjoyed every minute.<br />Christopher Nolan had another huge success making Bane such a brilliant villain. Tom Hardy showed once again he's a real badass. I wish some things have been slightly different (e.g. Bane is too human to my taste, he should've been more monstrous), but I couldn't expect a more enjoying Batman movie than that.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|Nice acting, but not as believable as you would hope. action is more in line with different kind of plot, not scifi
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I wish I could find films this good every time!  We absolutely loved it.  Highly recommend it and Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt are so well cast.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Bought this becasue everyone was reading it. It wasnt disappointing. Not as expected, much less of somethings and so much more character detail. REally an easy read. Couldnt put it down.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the abilty to read a daily plan anywhere and in any version. The different versions help when I do not understand what I am reading or want to clarify what I just read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Reallygot to like the characters in the book and wanted to watch them unfold as the trilogy unfolded. Wanted to know what made them tick. Well written
B008IJTFYW|3.0|Love the sounds, the interface. When I drift off, I like to play a game too, and I don't see a way to run this in the background. Point me to the paid version the minute I can!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Got book one for all the hype, got this one because I really grew to like the characters and wanted to see thier story and how it ended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is basically one of the most laid back games of Solitaire I have played on line.  Try it you will like it too.  ....do
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Our grandson loves playing angry birds and these did not disappoint. He is enjoying it a great deal. Easy to download and runs problem free
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I really like Men in Black series and this one is no different.  The movie really explains a lot.  You won't be sorry you watched it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|got thison recommendations. couldnt put it down. Read it in 2 days and on to the 2nd book already. Well written with attention to detail.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great acting, very funny cast with a good script!  What is not to enjoy?  Would even watch it a second time which I rarely do with any movie.  No surprise that &#34;Fat Amy&#34; steals the show!  This actress has wonderful comedic timing and is always a pleasure to watch on screen!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I liked the first book a lot... this one seemed to really beat around the bush and do a lot of back and forth.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Would never recommend this movie to anyone.  A bong smoking bear who is a grown man's best friend is simply not funny.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I am a huge Dexter fan, so I pre-ordered as soon as it was available.  This is not my favorite season of Dexter plot-wise.  It seems that this season was mostly a set-up for Season Seven.  The other reviews are accurate. I knew exactly how it all would end from the very beginning because the promotional preview for Season Seven gave it away.  That said, I'm glad I watched this season.  It's necessary for viewing next season, which I think will be great, and these episodes did have their moments.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|This movie is great! One of my favorites, and now I can add it proudly to my collection. Woo hoo!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|i really enjoy playing this game  not to complicated and i get to save the world  not a bad thing to do when you have 5 minutes to kill
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|.....it's Marley! Is there any need to say anything else?<br />Sit back, dance, whatever. Enjoy the ride. Enjoy the music.
B007N8RULO|5.0|can't go wrong with spider slitaire!! love it<br />Keeps me entertained for hours at home and<br />while sitting in dr. offices.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|But I felt like the storyline was incomplete. The movie started out fun and funny, but halfway through it died down a bit too much for me. I like it, yet I don't love it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|gave this as a gift to my 8 yr. old granddaughter.<br />she loved it.and so did her dad ......very good family message
B0073LWEXK|5.0|A great app to play around with. It was a free app of the day when I picked it up.
0061122416|4.0|Just a good book! Very touching a some points and I walked away with some important life lesson reminders.<br />True poetry many places in the book. In the midst of all the Theology books I have been reading, this one was great as a change of style and it refreshed me. I surely understand why that many people love this book.<br /><br />Exellent read that i'd want to recommend all of you<br /><br />Emil lavsen
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Shutter Island is a great movie! I got it on sale, so it definitely made it worth owning. Can not complain!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was really apprehensive about renting this movie. It kind of looked like a glee rip off. But it was actually nothing like glee and amazing to say the least!

B006LSZECO|5.0|This story keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Every time I thought I had it figured out there was a new twist! A must read!
B004SIP8SY|5.0|I got this movie during the holidays at a very good price. Could not pass up this amazing movie on blueray.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|gave me and others a lot of laughs. anyone I showed it to had never seen anything thing like it before.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This is a great movie! While it does not have the paper insert, for the price the movie is worth owning!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found life of pi to be gripping and well written, it just needed something else to give it 5stars.<br /><br />I would recommend to all :)
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I got this as a faotd. Very fun game. Let's you save your progress any time and has no timer. Only down side is you can't turn off the vibration in the game, which I believe to be killing my battery. Fix this and it is a 5 star game!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Fairly good, reminds me if the old gauntlet game. Glad that it's free, I'm a cheapskate.<br /><br />Like the options available.
1449382673|5.0|I have, over the 20+ years of my I.T. career, used several different varieties of instructional books on computer languages.  Head First is, hands down, the best out there in my opinion. As to why:<br /><br />1. I don't have a degree in Computer Science.  So programming and languages are quite a bit extra effort for me.  I like it that way, to be honest, as anything of value requires effort and patience. I've studied heavily technical resources and have done ok with them, but the process of the Head First series are fun, clearly written, and surprisingly retentive.  Above all, they are perfect for a beginner or novice.<br /><br />2. Learning Java, C, C++, or C# is not easy.  So, I took a step back and dove into Python (we are a Python shop where I work) as several of the senior devs all told me the best language to start with is Python because it is so easy to learn. Couple that with Head First... and you have a no-brainer can't lose.<br /><br />3. Instaneous Gratification.  In the first hours you'll be writing your first programs.<br /><br />Drawbacks:  I am on Python 2.7 and these are written for Python 3.  Some of the exercises are not as clear cut as the book, but with help from Google I was easily able to find the appropriate commands and re-work the scripts to my configuration.<br /><br />As a result, the drawbacks become a win... and that, in of itself, puts the 5th star on my rating.<br /><br />Dig in, and enjoy what you learn!<br /><br />UPDATE:  1/2/14<br />Still love these course!  However, there is an exercise that requires you to set up a dev app for running Twitter OAuth.  The book was written for a much older version and it is quite a bit more complicated (and with that secure) than the example exercise in the book.  Be sure to check that the most recent edition you are about to purchase, contains updated info on how to set up your developer OAuth, or else you'll hit a brick wall so hard, you're great-great-grandchildren will yell \\"Ouch!\\"

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again, i must admit my enjoyment. provocative, but sweet. a modern day, \\"Pretty Woman.\\" it will remind the reader that we have grown-up.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Good movie! I only wish I hadn't downloaded it to watch it on a flight across country.  Action packed.  I recommend it.
B00729Z6R4|5.0|H.e.a.t's first two albums are packed full of hooky hard rockers. In fact, a few of their songs from those albums probably have one hook or riff too many. (Sometimes less is more, of course.) The boys have remedied this on their third and best package &#34;Address the Nation&#34;.  The sound is refined and streamlined.  And while there is less throwaway riffing, there is much more more power in the sound, especially in the drum sound which has been the weakest link in the band so far. The new vocalist also is a great match for their new found power.  Although many reviewers seem to have been bowled over by the first two albums, I was a bit underwhelmed. Their material was fine but it needed someone to make it sound like a major label release. This has been rectified here and I look forward to album number 4! Good work guys!
B0019IMVDG|5.0|I had a friend who was always telling me I had to watch this movie.  I finally broke down and watched it, and I wish I had done it sooner.  What a great movie!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I rented this via Amazon and the movie was good; if you are a fan of the series. The quality was full HD and the process was simple.
B001NLKT60|2.0|I watched The Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo & am really trying to read this book before the next movie comes out, but I cannot seem to get past Ch. 2.  I'm sure its a good book, it's just not catching my attention.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|We went to the movies when 'Tin-Tin' came out, LOVED it. The DVD of course is GREAT also. If you like excitement, this is it! Whether you are a 'Tin-Tin' fan or not it is a must see!!!!!<br /><br />Bruce
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I finished this book in a day.  I don't normally read these types of books, but this one caught my attention early on and was able to keep me interetested until the end.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It was a very different premise having to do with the obsession that we've created with time. Hurry here..hurry there. Mitch Albom put an interesting spin on it. I would highly recommend this book.
0060989157|5.0|I'm a huge Motley Crue fan and this book this is a great book that is a must read for any fan.  I couldn't put it down.
1451648537|5.0|This review is being typed on a Macbook Pro, which I purchased two years ago. Later, when I go to the gym, I will listen to songs purchased on iTunes, which I have transferred over (using Firewire) to my iPhone 4s; I have been caught in the snare of Apple's enclosed system for the past year and have no intention of leaving it anytime soon. What this book has done, for me and countless other Apple fans, is help me understand the devices I use through an understanding of the man who created them.<br /><br />Walter Issacson's biography is highly readable and very compelling. I admit that before opening this book I was ignorant of just how much of an impact Steve Jobs has had on Silicon Valley and technology generally. It was engaging to read Isaacson's account of the construction of the Apple II in his parents garage, the development of the Macintosh, the creation of Next, the acquisition of Pixar, and his eventual return to Apple where he saved the company and entered his most creative years at the age of 40 (developing iTunes, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad).<br /><br />Most interesting to me though was how his devices (take your pick between the iPhone, Macbook, etc.) are an almost perfect analogy to his personality and disposition. The clean and elegant design is an undoubted result of his Zen Buddhist background. The enclosed system, in which the case cannot be opened, the software altered, and the multiple device connectivity, are a striking parallel to his ridiculous demand for control. It was hard not to read the book and find yourself liking Jobs. Yes, he was an ego-maniac, a control freak, a sometimes cruel individual, an abandoner, and he had the temperament of a rattle-snake, but he was also a genius.<br /><br />It isn't that he was always correct, but he was right on SO MANY things that it is astounding to look back and consider some of his most strategic business decisions and creative endeavors. Important also is noting that he himself invented little. Instead, he combined the ideas and notions of others (from Steve Wozniak to John Lasseter) to create products that people had as of yet not understood they even needed. This ability, combined with a borderline debilitating perfectionism, gravitational personality, and ingenuity made it possible for him to bring together the best and the brightest and create a company which will hopefully endure for many years following his death. Being a Seattle-ite I was drawn as well to his interactions with Bill Gates and how different (yet similar) their egos and ideologies were.<br /><br />This biography was an excellent read and a must for anyone interested in Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs himself, or the creation of one of technologies biggest companies. I found myself very much rooting for Apple and Jobs, and I believe that Isaacson was too, because his affection is evident in his writing. Academically, this could be a good thing or a bad thing, but it is clearly the most heavily researched and exhaustive biography that is likely to emerge in a very long time. Because Jobs had no control over the product (other than the cover design), it is a compelling, but not always flattering bio of a mercurial and important individual.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I'm a huge Bob Marley fan and I thought this movie was great! I've watched it twice.  It's definetly worth the money!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I bought this as a gift and now im really kinda wanting it for myself.  Definately worth the money, puts you in the holiday spirit
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I am 100% in love with mushy girly romance novels and thus one definitely fit the bill. I laughed. I cried. I loved.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's been awhile since I read this book and when j decided to read it again, I still fell in love with the idea of the girl on fire and the boy with the bread together. I still felt the excitement :) Suzanne Collins has a gift.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I rated this Deluxe 2 CD version a thumbs up five star because it not only has all the songs I love but the fabulous four new<br />songs beautifully performed.<br />I liked the 2 CD version.  Nothing for me to dislike here. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys four fine voices  doing<br />crossover classical.
0525478817|5.0|First of all, let me start this by saying, I believe there are books written to entertain and there are books written to touch your soul. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is a book that touches your soul. I'm kind of struggling with writing this review, because nothing I say is going to justify how absolutely amazing this book was. John Green's ability to have me laughing and sobbing in the same breath has blown me away. The subject matter of this book is bleak, but he still manages to infuse humor in the places you would least expect. This was, by far, the most beautifully written book I have ever read. As for the characters, Hazel and Augustus were my two favorite characters in a book. Ever. Witty and brave, when these two got together on a page, you couldn't help but smile. This is one that will break your heart, but it's worth every tear shed. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is a must read!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|The undeniably BEST album of the year.  From beginning to end, repeated endlessly, this album will continue to amaze you again and again.  Unique vocals, edgy beats and melodies, and raw lyrics to back it all up.  I can't tell you more, it just gets better and better the more you listen.<br /><br />I have bought/listened to nearly 50 albums in 2012, and I tell you, An Awesome Wave tops the list.  Spend the few dollars right now and buy a digital download off amazon, make haste, there is no time to waste.<br /><br />Alt-J will send major ripples through the air waves in the coming years, be among the first to support something truly special.

B000TEUSJK|5.0|WELL WHAT CAN I SAY, THIS MOVIE IS .......WELL IT ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, NOT A MOVIE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER, BUT IT WAS INTERESTING,  THANK YOU
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This is my most favorite vampire movie of all time (with the possible exception of Van Helsing), It puts fun into the gory tales and shows different ethnicities.  Any one can get the bite.
B000002549|5.0|First, a confession:  I am not a fan of Barbra Streisand.  However, I happened upon this fabulous recording of classical song decades ago, and thought its remastered version to be worth another round of Christmas presents.  Its title alone brings the music to mind, and entertain me without the need to put a CD into a player!
B00APUQJLO|5.0|This movie is not for everyone! I thoroughly enjoyed this film once I got into it and I want to see it again to see what I missed the first time. That's why I also purchased the film, Cronenberg is ahead of his time and Pattinson is great!
1554072840|5.0|We used this book for my daughter; and now we have a copy for my grand daughter. Thanks  a lot!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I've read several of Ken Follett's books, and am amazed at how much research must have gone into writing those books. His books grip you from the very start, and you find it difficult to put them down. He has a way to put historical facts in perspective. Excellent book!
B005P4PAVK|5.0|So hilarious the big bang theory is the best show i have ever seen and sheldon just cracks me up
B008N1V11U|5.0|I loved the game and my dad had to stop me from playing the entire thing in a day! Though I don't understand the trees, they look like they have paper leaves.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Two Steps From Hell has delivered the good stuff as always.  Protectors of the Earth is my favorite song by them.
0399246665|5.0|Great book set for kids, very entertaining.  good head start for the little ones to learn and learn to love reading.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved this book.  Laughed and cried.  All Jojo Moyes books I have read are good and are always enjoyed.
014241722X|4.0|I was very glad I read the reviews of this book before listening to it on CD with my boys, ages 10 and 12. I was able to prepare them for the fact that this is basically book 1 in a series and that the plot would NOT be tied up at the end. Some say it's a shameless ploy on Grisham's part to sell more books. Probably. But it worked for us as my boys wanted to hear what happened to Pete Duffy. We have read the SECOND book in the series, though, and STILL don't know what happened to Pete Duffy. So have your kids go into these books knowing it's a commitment to the series and not one book.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that Grisham's writing seemed to lack the flair I remember from his books for adults. There is nothing impressive or charming about his writing in these books at all. But what I found most worthwhile were the lessons and information my kids were picking up, probably without realizing it, such as an introduction to our legal system, how it works, terminology, your rights, what lawyers do, different kinds of law, the role of the jury, etc. I liked that while Theo does not like school (my boys could relate to this), he is still smart and interested in learning and helping people. I liked that he and his family dedicate time to visiting family members, volunteering at a shelter and going to church (without Grisham's sounding preachy). Grisham poses a lot of good ethical/moral dilemmas Theo must face and these provide good opportunities to talk with your kids about right and wrong. I also like that he shows kids getting in trouble with the law and the consequences of their actions. He shows that kids struggle with parents who are divorcing or who neglect them. These are all good lessons my kids can learn to understand the struggles other people face.<br /><br />So as long as you go into these books knowing you won't have the plot neatly tied up at the end and that the writing is nothing special, you'll enjoy the plot and what Theo learns along the way.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book! It was truly amazing! MUST READ!!!!  YOU MUST!!!!!!!!!!! The rebellion, courage, and strength is beautiful! READ IT!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best movies ever made! My husband and I both love this movie. There is an excellent strategic plot and good action. Clean family fun.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so cool like the other ones<br />It fun to read<br />This book so pretty sweet  you should read it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so well written. It had me grasping breath and clenching my stomach in anticipation of what would happen next. It was intriguing, heartbreaking, infusing, and wonderful at the same time. I was a bit skeptical about reading it because it's a young adult book and honestly which adult in their right mind wants to read about the live life of a teenager, it just feels wrong, but nothing about this book was immature. It was intense to put it mildly. Definitely recommend it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is one of my favourites. A home run for Mr.Riordan. This is a good book for all ages.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I really loved the production of this book as a Musical and I loved the Movie made even more. I love this soundtrack, i only wish it had more songs, but I am happy with it anyway. Plus the PRICE!!!! I usually buy my music off Itunes, but Amazon cloud sucked me in with the deal that i got this album for!!! Now i shop here. Love it to death!!<br />Great piece of work!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|U kept it all going not a single moment was dull I could not put it down I can't wait for the next one I want to no how it ends
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I really enjoyed this book. It is not the normal genre I read but I found it sad and dark at times, but the strength of the main character was amazing.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|It reads like it was written by a twelve year old. I purchased this book based upon all of the excellent reviews, but I was quite disappointed. The prose lacks depth and richness I have come to expect from well reviewed stories.
B00867GJYK|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  The story is engaging and is as good as I remembered.  My set has both the regular and blue ray....
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I watched the soap as a teenager... the movie was very entertaining and followed the original plot line.  Just as campy as the soap, too!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's of all time. I may not always be in the mood t listen to it, but I never tire of the songs. It's beautiful and bewilderingly depressing and energetic simultaneously.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I enjoyed 'Argo', but some people are talking this flick up as an Oscar winner for best picture. That I cannot see. However, it is definitely a story worth telling as it's a fascinating tale and reminds Americans about the dangers of a country like Iran.<br /><br />Perhaps the most gripping part of the film is the opening, as the US embassy is about to be taken over by fanatical 'students' and supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who just returned to Iran as a result of the 1979 revolution. Ben Affleck does a great job in chronicling how US embassy staff members went about shredding classified documents, minutes before the embassy compound is taken over by the fanatics. Equally fascinating is the way in which the six US staff members make their escape, as they simply walk out on to the street from an adjoining building, while the crazed Iranians are focusing on attacking the main part of the compound.<br /><br />When I first heard about 'Argo', I thought the whole operation was much more extensive, involving a whole film crew entering Iran and actually beginning to film a phony movie there. It wasn't quite that complicated. CIA operative Tony Mendez's plan was simply to create the illusion that a movie was going to be made in Hollywood, by taking out an ad in a trade paper and holding a 'table read' of the script, which was covered by the press. Interestingly enough, the producer played by Alan Arkin is a fictional construct; only John Goodman's character, John Chambers, the Hollywood make-up artist, actually existed.<br /><br />As the Argo story develops, with Mendez flying to Iran posing as a Canadian film producer and establishing contact with the Iranian film board, it all seemed quite plausible. And when Mendez takes the six members to a bazaar in the city, where their cover is almost blown when confronted by an angry crowd, that also seemed quite real. But when we finally arrive at the crucial scene, where the six must get past an Iranian ticket taker at the airport, without any proof that they actually came into the country, I wondered if that happened the way it's depicted in the film. It turns out that in reality, the Canadian ambassador's wife purchased three separate sets of tickets on three different airlines for the six embassy staff members.<br /><br />Even more historically inaccurate is the suspenseful scene in the film, in which the Carter administration cancels the mission just as Mendez is about to attempt to whisk his charges out of Iran. In reality, the mission was canceled for only thirty minutes and that occurred BEFORE Mendez left the United States.<br /><br />Finally, perhaps the most suspenseful part of the film, the confrontation with the Revolutionary guards at the departure gate, the call to Hollywood to confirm Mendez's cover and big chase out on the runway--none of that ever happened. Even without prior knowledge of the true history of the events depicted here, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the chase on the runway was pure Hollywood.<br /><br />Does Affleck's 'dramatic license', diminish the film's overall impact? Frankly, yes. Too much of what goes on, seems a bit far-fetched. Nonetheless, 'Argo' is still quite entertaining and is worth the price of admission. More credit should have gone to the Canadian ambassador Taylor, in his role in saving the US embassy staff members (the closing credits merely allude to the great co-operation between the US and Canada and say nothing specifically of Taylor's heroics).<br /><br />Finally, I was most impressed by the casting choices for the six embassy staff members. The ID cards of the actual escapees are shown during the closing credits, juxtaposed with the actors playing them. Take a look at the resemblance between the real and the fictional characters.

0143120530|5.0|This book is about the science of memory. Generally I like reading books in areas that I know little about and that can change the way I look at or understand the world. This book definitely fulfilled that objective. It discusses the science of memory, a field I was not too familiar with. It offers interesting tidbits such as the fact that the average person can only retain 7 ideas in their working memory at one time before you lose focus on a topic. It also entertainingly presents some of the most famous cases in neuroscience about people who had injuries to their brains and the result it had on their individuality. Especially heartening is the case of one older man who cannot remember anything from the recent past and experiences each day as if it were new. Interestingly, he can remember things further back in his life.<br /><br />All of this is layered across a narrative that the author provides of his decision to participate in the American Memory Championship. I had never even heard of such an event. Contestants vie for a championship by memorizing decks of cards (in order), people's names and biographies, poems and long strings of numbers. The most rip-roaring fun in this book is how the author uses memory techniques to accomplish this with the most famous being the Memory Palace. By this technique, you take a place you are very familiar with like your childhood home (the brain is better at remembering spatial and visual cues) and populate it with the most ludicrous, ridiculous and memorable images you can. For example, to memorize the order of a deck of cards, the author will start at his mailbox and put in images there to remind him that the first three cards are the two of hearts, then the king of diamonds, then the four of spades. The more crazy the image, the more likely you are to remember it. Moonwalking with Einstein is one of these images used by the author.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the science of memory and challenge yourself to memorize a whole deck of cards. If I can make only one criticism, it is that the author spent too much time in the last third of the book providing biographical detail about other players on the memory scene, which I felt took away from the central interest of the book.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Affordable, as described and it shipped quickly.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  The transfer quality was pretty good for a blu-ray.  Would have loved more special features though.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|When The Matrix first came out I loved it and the subsequent movies that followed. I purchased the five disc collectors edition which has all the behind the scenes footage you could ever want, a friend had never seen it before, so I gave it to her as a gift. I am just as happy with the four movies, which also includes the Animatrix, as these have different Special Features that I hadn't seen before. If you love Sci-fi and action movies, this is the ticket for you! I love following that Rabbit and finding out how deep the Rabbit hole goes.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Only problem with this series is that it is hard to stop watching till all the episodes are watched.  Can't wait till Season 7
B007TNS6JI|5.0|If you're seeking to waste some time, or simply just looking for a character-progressive game, dungeon hunter 3 is the game for you. It may not have a storyline, but the excitement that comes from adorning your player with armor, skills, and weapons is enough to sate any fantasy lover's thirst. Delve into dungeon hunter 3 as a warrior, rogue, or sorcerer and try as you may from releasing your hold on your console.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is a really nice cover that protects the kindle fire well and is not too bulky.<br />Great while traveling.
8866130931|5.0|I would be lost without this thing! There's plenty of room for your daily tasks and a large note section for any overflow you may need. Mine is attached to me throughout the day in the office and gets filled with the random nonsense that goes on through the day making it essential throughout the year.<br />The back pocket is handy but gives out after a while, mine seems to last until December 2x so it acts as its own reminder when it is time to replace.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I believe it must be good !  My son watched it while on his boat down in the Virgin Islands.  He called me and told me to get it !
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Seth Macfarlane and Mark Wahlberg are funny enough to make this work. Everyone enjoyed it and got several laughs throughout.
1419707671|5.0|I got this set for my son for Christmas because he loves the Wimpy Kid series. He was so excited to get this boxed set of his favorite books. The books are interesting for him to read over and over. They have pictures throughout them to keep his attention and  humor that kids can appreciate.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another fast , easy read by John Grisham. I always enjoy his stories and this one was fun too. Good beach book.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|What a delight!  I was hesitant to continue beyond the circus descriptions in the first several pages, but the thrilling, concise characters and crisp dialog finally sucked me in- and that was before I recognized the classic love story woven like strands into an ever-expanding web.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My son loved it. I actually watched it and liked it. It changed my view on the movie; thought I would not like it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bought this for my Nikon D3100.  I can fit the camera body, two lenses, the flash, and charging cables in the backpack.  The inserts are movable to better fit your camera.  The side strap will hold a small tri-pod.<br /><br />Have taken the bag out a few times so far and have not had any issues.  I tend to always open the backpack with it laying flat to ensure nothing falls out.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We saw this in the theater and loved it, so I had to grab a few copies when Amazon had it for $3!  I gave this to several kids for Chirstmas.  The story is that of the famous Dr. Seuss book, but it is expanded quite a bit to make a full length movie.  The story is wonderful, the animation is beautiful, and the kids laugh out loud a lot.  We love it!
B000001ESF|4.0|...if you like Rush. Remastered songs sound awesome. Nice cd for Rush fans. Not easily found in local stores either.
