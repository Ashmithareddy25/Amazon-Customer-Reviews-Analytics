B000002GB9|3.0|This is their best work but I cannot get over how a record company releases a CD with less than 30 minutes worth of music. As a kid, I was impressed with this release. As an adult, an eight song album is a joke! This was no punk rock band but rather a talented bunch of songwriters and musicians. At the zenith of your careers, for your best album, you could only do 8 songs?
B000000ORX|5.0|I had lost touch with Joni's music after her fantastic run of classic albums of the 70's (Mingus was the last album I purchased and I only thought it was OK). I decided to purchase this after hearing \\"Come In From The Cold\\" on the radio recently and I'm so glad I did. I rank this among her finest and it is a strong reminder that Joni is one of the most important and most original songwriters of the last few generations. All but a couple of the cuts are fantastic with my favorites being the aforementioned \\"Cold\\", \\"Nothing Can Be Done\\" and the title cut. Great record!
B00005JOML|4.0|This film is not going to revolutionize the cinema and the Western world with some deep humanistic and anthropological thinking. No one will get a migraine out of it. But you will enjoy the action and the variety of means of transportation, planes, boats, ships, speedboats, cars and a few others, but no skateboards and no pedalos. No use to speak of the weapons. You have them all, except long swords, short swords and other arms from the knife family, except for one fast flying vision of one in some back scene. You will learn, and that is a great achievement, that a woman is, or believes she is, the boss of the drug business, but not an American woman. American women must not ber liberated enough for that. A Cuban woman from the phallocratic country we all know and have visited many times, since it is absolutely routine to go in and out of it. The end is typical of what an action film has to be : a blood bath, but with the blood of the drugtraffickers ; of course, since American cops, even under cover are not mortal, far from it, since their closest cousin is immortal God himself. And they even ressuscitate a black woman at the end, the private friend of the black cop of our pair of vice-cops. Jesus is really far behind with modern medecine : even black women can come back from death in a jiffy : nothing to compare woth Jewish embalming in the first century of our era. But one thing is sure : you will get out of the theater relaxed and entertained, even if you are not intellectually enlightened.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne
0790731452|4.0|Are you tired of cookie-cutter comedies?  Looking for something different, outrageously funny, and filled with top-notch acting?  Mars Attacks is the movie that you are looking for.  The superb star-studded cast is just the icing on the cake of this hilarious spoof of sci-fi B-movies.
0064407667|2.0|I was drawn to this book by some great reviews that suggested that it might be an amusing read for an adult like Harry Potter, or the Narnia books. It is not. It may be fine for a young child but otherwise it has no interest. It can be read by an adult in an hour or two, has little plot, no well defined characters or locations. It even explains words to you as if you were seven years old. It does have an element of black humour that will amuse some children. Buy it for a child as an easy read to encourage them to pick up a book rather than a video game but otherwise look elsewhere for good children's literature.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I love racing and this was always one of my favorite movies on the topic.  James Garner is great in the lead role as a has-been driver who comes back to the top.  The racing scenes are spectacular and the love stories are poignant and very realistic.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|This show started when I was 15, the same age as some of the characters, and I watched it religiously for its 10 seasons. I have been waiting for the day it would be released on DVD since the day the Finale aired. I'm thrilled they're finally doing it. I may be 30 now, but this show lives on in my heart and will always be one of my favorite series ever.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|I too remember the original, liked it, and I am a real big fan of Gene Hackman. That being said, this is not the original. Alot of people feel the re-make lacked character build-up and did not follow the original story line. I agree the first one dealt more on the characters and their lives, however realistically in real life that would not occur.  This is a disaster movie, plain and simple.  It means special effects.  I have been on cruises and anyone can tell you that while you meet people, you do not get too many details on their lives or can meet and greet that vast amount of people in less than a couple days time.  In a tense and critical situation you fight for your life and not socialize, thats why they invented prequels, and most of the time nobody goes to the theater to see those. Bottom line it's easy to put 2 and 2 together and figure out the characters.  The star of this film is the ship and the effects.  The original was too slow paced.  This one keeps you engaged at every turn on a more true to life time line and the cast played well off of each other.  As with the original however, if you are a big fan of certain characters, you may be disappointed at the end.  Because as is in every diaster movie someones got to go!
B00005MP58|5.0|This short BBC series produced in the 90's is the best rendition of Pride and Prejudice to date.The acting is superb by all cast members and Colin Firth will always be the epitome of Mr.Darcy.Because it is a mini-series and not a two hour movie,the plot is allowed to fully developed to the delight of all who watch it.I would recommend this series to anyone, who is a fan,wants to be a fan or isn't a fan yet but will be. <br />

B0000C8AW2|5.0|Buried on this weird semi-schlocky album is the closer, the epic \\"Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat).\\" I'm gonna go out on a big limb here and say this may be Bobby's finest performance.  The song is a tour of the living hell the man seemed to be living in c.1978; unlimited wealth, drugs everywhere, mansion in Malibu, surrounded by sycophants, a mere Rock Star haunted by memories of his heroic '60's past, making terrible music, coasting on his legend, as he lost the family he'd put ahead of his career since '67 (threw them away, really). For years I thought the despairing tone derived from the recent break-up of his marriage; now listening to the mixture of anguish and elation when he sings the final lines,  \\"I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive/But without You it just don't seem right/O where are You tonight?\\"  it is clear he's singing about God, looking for an elusive salvation, and his embrace of Jesus is just around the corner.  I'm no believer, but the sheer bereft agony in Dylan's voice on this song is so real, the imagery so searing (\\"If you don't believe there's a price/For this sweet paradise/Just remind me to show ya the scars\\")(\\"I fought with my twin/That enemy within/Till both of us fell by the way/Horseplay and disease is killin' me by degrees/While the law looks the other way\\")I'm happy he found some sort of peace in religion, at least for a while.  On the other hand, \\"Where are You Tonight\\" is living proof that misery probably breeds better art than solace.  Great song to play when you feel like you're looking at the world from the bottom of a shot glass.  There is real catharsis goin' on, a rare thing in a rock 'n roll song.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband had seen some of this series before.  Later, we had borrowed the set from a friend.  The kids and I decided to order it for him for his birthday.  We've watched it all the way through again and don't seem to tire of it.
B00008972S|5.0|This is the best movie ever created and that is all that needs to be said.

0316666343|3.0|I became immediately engrossed in this novel.  It was riveting.  Unfortunately, somewhere just after the midpoint of the book, I felt the whole thing fell flat and I had to almost force myself to finish the book. <br /> <br />The author's concept of heaven and the \\"interaction\\" between those that have passed and us mere mortals still on Earth is both interesting and hopeful.  It has given me lots to think about.  It could have been a great novel, if only the story hadn't languished after having me so inspired.
B000AGTPUA|2.0|Chris Van Alsberg's beloved Christmas classic is brought to the screen in this sickeningly self indulgent, outrageously overblown animated film. The characters are bland,and their movements are creepy and mechanical, both of which make them feel more like robots than humans. The film's biggest problem is that it dosen't seem to know whether to treat itself like a horror movie, a children's Christmas cartoon, or a slapstick comedy. The film overflows with half-baked ideas,for instance,there is a mysterious hobo-zombie who makes his home   on the train's roof and a room filled with abandoned toys. It is NOT an exaggeration to describe the film as creepy, as many other reviewers have. While not quite the ''cat''astrophe of the Seuess films,THE POLAR EXPRESS is still something of a train wreck.     SCORE:4/10
B00005JP5J|3.0|This was not your typical family, but it is more normal today than the average grouping.  Every one of them faces a great disappointment but hangs in together.  It is a comedic tragedy.  Greg Kinnear was superb as the long-suffering dad Richard who dictates that \\"a real loser is someone who is so afraid they don't try\\"; he feels that it is weak to apologize, and \\"winners never give up.\\"  When his big project fell through because \\"nobody cares about an unknown,\\" he was told that it is time to move on.      The whole premise revolves around seven-year-old Olive preparing to compete in a beauty contest and her granddad who is the most unhappy of them all teaches her a peculiar talent.  Olive is a misnomer, more like an Ann Margaret.  She has been told to \\"will yourself to win.\\"  Steve Carell was good as the disturbed Uncle Frank who had loved the wrong person.  I'm so glad you're still here, he was told, as he entered the family to rehab from a disastrous setback.  That too was said to me after my health scare in April by a stranger.  Sometimes, the words of wisdom we need to  hear come unexpectedly from strange sources.  I was upset and said something I shouldn't have said; later, I was upset and didn't mean the things I said.    The grandfather was the core of the family, the voice of experience.  There is a \\"Bernie\\" connection here, as his body is stolen from the hospital in order to get Olive to the Miss Sunshine contest on time, still one hundred miles from L.A.  This family had to travel in an old yellow VW bus for 800 miles from Alburquerque.  After Pop's sudden death, the supportive mom tells them \\"we are family, what matters is that we love each other.\\"  The funny thing is the way they show it.  At the hospital, Linda (all business) was the typical KAT driver:  he's not the only person to die here today!  On I10, out in California, the drivers were as bad as these in Knoxville and almost cause accidents with their aggressiveness.    They had to make a quick stop out on the highway where there was an oil well and track homes near Los Angeles.  Olive was dressed as a Sunshine Girl (my favorite of Eddie Fisher's songs) in her red boots and pink shorts.  It was a wild ride without a clutch, but they made it and mom tells them to \\"pretend to be normal.\\"  Carl Hampton Southcott was the host of the little Miss Sunshine pageant where all of the contestants with the exception of our Olive Hoover were experienced in this game and talented, but Olive was incredible with her vaudeville-style dancing.  She'd dedicated her being there to her dead grandad who had coached and showed her all the moves.    Her brother raved at his mom that \\"a mother is supposed to protect\\" but this one had allowed the children to grow in the ways which were best for them and was most supportive.  The whole family got in the act, and a good time was had by all -- even the audience.  I haven't laughed that much since I saw (and reviewed) 'The Dukes of Hazard.'  Olive blossomed into an Olivia.  Go see the transformation; you won't be sorry you did.    A lot happens during their long road trip and this movie is about those incidents and how the family dynamics build and rebuild during the journey. The movie starts with the three generations of Hoover family that includes Olive (played by Abigail Breslin), her brother (played by Paul Dano), Mom (played by Toni Collette), her Uncle Frank (played by Steve Carell), Grandpa (played by Alan Arkin) and Dad (played by Greg Kinnear). Little Miss Sunshine is hilarious and visual gag are fresh and funny. During the setup for the family's third trot, however, you think it can't possibly work again. Filmmakers Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton have the ability to gauge just how far they can go. The comedy in the movies seems to come out of nowhere.     The Hoover family is a totally unique and dysfunctional family. Even though everybody is a little eccentric in this family, but every one of us will be able to relate to them. We will see ourselves or our family in them.  Olive, just like her father is an extremely pipe dreaming person. Her Dad is a motivational speaker who believes he can sell his `prosaic nine-step program for success' into a book and video. Similarly, Olive who has a fresh-scrubbed look and tiny potbelly thinks that she can beat a bunch of JonBenet Ramsey look-alikes.     Her uncle has been put in her mother's care as he had attempted suicide after a fellow Proust scholar won a genius grant and stole his boyfriend. As he is still on suicide watch, he has to accompany Hoover to the contest also. Add to this is a Grandpa who snorts heroin and regrets not sleeping with too many women in his youth. He is the one who is teaching dance to Olive for her talent completion.     Real life married couple, Dayton and Faris do not muck around with an enticing script by putting distracting visual effects. So, the couple uses simplest of camera work and effects possible. Little Miss Sunshine is one of the most straightforwardly told movies, ever.     Every role has been cast perfectly and it's hard to imagine any other actor in any of the roles. For this strange finally reaches California which is a perfect destination for a family that's trying improve themselves, the land of promise.

0156012197|5.0|Antoine de Saint-Exupery's THE LITTLE PRINCE is one of the few books,along with J. M. Barrie's PETER PAN and Richard Adams' WATERSHIP DOWN, that will capture the hearts and minds of both children and adults. The existance of the prince is handled with more symbolism than realisim, so the story is difficult to film (althogh  a few have attempted to do so).The illustrations have simplicity, beauty,and a magic all their own. Many of my favorite quotes are found in this book, such as ''Every thing essential is invisible to the eyes'',and ''you risk tears if you let yourself be tamed''...This is a beautiful book about what is truly inportant in life - spiritual matters rather than the physical ones.
0767020308|5.0|excellent casting, true to Austen's genius, no cheese, entertaining, beckingsale nearly perfect--much better than both the low-budget bbc one and the high-budget hollywood one <br /> <br />but that's my opinion...
B0002XL35G|5.0|Is is possible to ever possess another? Is America (ancient and modern) alien to human life? Are we, as humans, ultimately alone? These ideas - trite, maybe, but psychologically powerful - are ideas that inhabit the work of one of America's great writers - Sam Shepard.  PARIS, TEXAS may be one of Mr Shepard's greatest collaborations.  Certainly, visually, it may be one of the most beautiful films of America ever made, DAYS OF HEAVEN and KOYAANISQATSI notwithstanding. The richness of the colours, the framing, represent a wondrous manifestation of Mr Shepard's vision, a vision that is reminiscent of Edward Hopper - humans isolated in a landscape albeit a stunningly beautiful one.  And whether that landscape is the Mojave Desert or suburban L.A. or urban Houston, it is a landscape that is strangely cold, and clean, eerie and unwelcoming.  Robbie Muller may be a master cinemaphotographer in the way he is able to give reality to Mr Shepard's and Mr Wender's vision.  Let's face it - a story is really a platform to launch off into exploring the wider questions.<br /><br />  One striking and memorable moment among many, is when the searching anti-hero, Everyman, Travis is walking purposefully (he is on a mission) across a sidewalk on a freeway cloverleaf interchange bridge - in the background beyond the steel safety rail in the middle distance are the freeways and the cars. Travis is the only animal, human, organic thing visible, and he walks purposefully on ignoring all vistas, and then we and he become aware of a ranting male voice which increases as we get closer and closer until it overcomes the hum and occasional whoosh of traffic.  THe voice gets louder declaiming the destruction of the world - Travis pauses when he gets to the man, listens a sentence or two, then continues on his way, edging past the \\"mad\\" orator.<br /><br />  Yes the film does tell a story.  And the story does hold our interest.  Our dreams may be pathetic, and romantic, and we may have to painfully learn that we cannot possess the thing we love the most or we will destroy it.  The joy of Travis is that he learns this, and through a wonderful act of redemption and generosity, achieves a kind of grace.<br /><br />  But it is the visual splendour and cinematic power of Wim Wenders,and Robbie Muller giving expression to Sam Shepard that makes this one of the greatest films about America.<br /><br />  Brilliant and captured stunningly well on DVD. I offer no comment on any extras.learn that we cannot possess the thing we love the most or we will destroy it.

B000H7J9RQ|5.0|I remember watching this when I was younger because my Dad loves Barbra and I'd watch this on VHS everynow and then.  It's a great concert set at her home and it's on a nice, clear night with a slight breeze and great guests and she sounded fantastic. <br />To me, the best songs are Somewhere, Papa Can You Hear Me and People.  She has a magnificent voice and even outdoors she pulls off every note.  The big surprise of the night was an unannounced appearance of Barry Gibb who sang Guilty with her and my all time favourite song of theirs What Kind Of Fool.  The crowd really lit up again when he came out. <br />This dated performance is probably best just for fans mainly.  She is outstanding and this concert was really enjoyable.  I love it and I'm so glad it's now out on DVD.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is one of the best movie about the civil war I've ever seen. It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in \\"Gods and Generals\\", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case. <br />I am a fan of this part of the U.S. history, and especially of the South, and I was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end.
0393327655|5.0|This is a very clear summary of why religion is the cause of so much suffering in the world. It is clear and convincing, except for the last chapter, which I simply did not understand. <br />Another (slight) shortcoming might be, that the author does not seem to distinguish between the USA, where Christian fundamentalism is definitely on the upswing ( up to and including such absurdities like considering \\"Creationism\\" a viable alternative to Darwin's evolution, apparently even by the current President George W. Bush!) and Europe (at least my native Germany), where religion plays hardly any role in public life. However, with the USA being the only power left, this omission might be o.k. <br /> <br />There is no \\"political correctness\\" in this book, it calls things by their name.
158234082X|4.0|In this funny book you get an extraordinary look into what really goes on in the professional kitchens around USA, mostly New York. The author is the present chef of the New York-restaurant Les Halles, and he tells you everything. From his beginning in humble and small restaurants and caf&eacute;s to the present day as chef in a famous restaurant. There are gross details in this book, making you think twice about ever eating out again, and sometimes it is hard to believe that this is the truth. Does the fine and elegant food really come from the hands of tattooed and dirty scumbags, fighting and drinking out back or does the author exaggerate a bit here and there? I don't know, but the book and the writing definitely has an honest feel to it, and it is possible that is really is like this. We follow the chef's ups and downs through his cooking and private life, but mostly through his cooking life. We learn about what it is like to work in a greasy caf&eacute; as well as in a huge establishment, and we also get a good look into the business side of running a restaurant as well as some great tips, like not ordering fish in a restaurant during the weekend, and I am also thinking twice about the whole brunch-concept after having read the book, brunch being a mix of a whole week's leftovers. The book is well written, and the language is never too much, even though it may seem brutal and brutally honest in some passages.
0312335164|1.0|Maybe I have just read too many thrillers, but I knew exactly what was going to happen long before it did.  Toward the end I was yelling at the characters because it was taking them so long to figue things out.  It was fast paced certainly but totally predictable.

0345442970|5.0|What an awesome kickoff to the Star Wars Expanded Universe this book is! Luceno masterfully captures the prequel \\"feel\\" and spins a tale which deepens and adds layers to characters and plotlines presented in The Phantom Menace. The book could be characterized as a political thriller with liberal dashes of action sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />Cloak of Deception kicks off with a nifty echo of the opening sequence of The Phantom Menace (it was published after, although it is set before the film). Much like the start of the movie, the first few chapters are chock-full of shipboard Jedi action, Neimoidians, battle droids, and more. Luceno writes in a very descriptive style and does not take for granted that the reader has seen the Star Wars films, making for a stronger novel.<br /><br />Many characters from The Phantom Menace make their EU debut here, and there are also entertaining cameos from characters who play significant roles later in the saga, such as Lieutenant Governor Tarkin, Vergere, and Jorus C'baoth. Considering the book was published in 2001, it meshes well with the two prequel films released afterward. The Separatist commerce organizations of Attack of the Clones are all worked into the story by name, along with many of the bit-player Senators and Jedi. A sequence early on in the book takes place at the Coruscant Opera House, which marries up nicely (and quite accidentally) with the dialogue between Palpatine and Anakin that takes place there in Revenge of the Sith.<br /><br />I was most impressed by the complexity of the plot Luceno has woven. Palpatine and his alter-ego Darth Sidious pull the strings of virtually every character in the story. At times I had to step back and think through exactly what each character knew and what they didn't to see how Palpatine's plans were falling into place. One element I found a bit confusing early on is whether Palpatine had anticipated Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's involvement in the Nebula Front/Trade Federation/Old Republic conflict he was brewing. Whether he did or not, though, it works to his advantage as the Jedi begin to get entangled in and compromised by the corruption and duplicity spreading through the government.<br /><br />Cloak of Deception fills out the \\"accusations of corruption\\" against Valorum that Palpatine mentions in The Phantom Menace and sets the stage for the forthcoming vote-of-no-confidence in Valorum's leadership. It explains why Sidious instructed the Trade Federation to blockade Naboo in particular and manages to breathe some life into the somewhat dry concept of taxation of trade routes being a key conflict driver in The Phantom Menace.<br /><br />Luceno does a great job bringing out and enlivening some of the murkier story elements from the first prequel film. His descriptive powers serve his story well and he leaves many tasty tidbits for serious fans of the EU to digest. This book is very highly recommended to anyone wanting a quality Star Wars read and especially highly to fans of the prequels.n/Old Republic conflict he was brewing.

But the vocal runs and unnecessary swoops sometimes make my ears tired. Having said that, this project is pretty flawless.  Favorite tracks: 'On Our Way', \\"Without You\\" (listen to the intricately weaved, multi-layered backing vocals; the best song Mariah never did!), \\"Candyman\\", and the stellar \\"Save Me From Myself\\".  For those of you wondering what the \\"F.U.S.S.\\" is all about - it's short for 'F#$k You, Scott Storch'.  He was a producer and co-writer of a few tracks from 'Stripped' (she cleverly works in the titles of those tracks in the little snippet of a song).
B000EU1PKA|4.0|Coming out from a law-suit (after their label change) and a huge line-up change, which leaves legendary guitarist-songwriter Kai Hansen out of the band, Helloween come back with \\"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\\". An album bashed by music critics due to the fact that the band changed their music, to a small effect, when compared to their highly praised Keeper Of The Seven Keys records. All in all a memorable album, with several highlights and a strong release if compared to several future outputs of the band.  \\"Pink Bubbles...\\" admitably has a really strange, even silly title but this is not the case with the song writing. The music departs from the continuous double-bass power metal stile and is enriched with blues and rock influences, together with some more mainstream ideas as well. Some songs are softer than the usual tracks found on the Keeper records, reminding more of melodic metal than power metal, but that's not a drawback for sure.   Without diving into each and every song, I'm going to name only the outstanding ones! \\"The Chance\\" is a mid-paced heavy metal anthem. The song contains some of the album's best vocals, an infectious chorus, a jaw dropping guitar solo, impressive bass lines and is the most known track from this release. \\"Mankind\\" is a great progressive epic, with wonderful musical and vocal variations. \\"Someone's Crying\\" is the only song that could be categorized as pure power metal (fast double-base drumming), a truly memorable track with fast guitar solos, a wonderful chorus and impressive drumming, that hankers back to the band's previous outputs. \\"Kids of the Century\\" is another fast song with clever lyrics, another great chorus and outstanding guitar solos. Finally, \\"Your Turn\\" is a beautiful rock/blues ballad with amazing vocals.   The new guitarist, Roland Grapow, proves to be a worthy replacement. His guitar playing is outstanding and he also contributes some great tracks to the album. Vocalist Michael Kiske has improved his vocal technique even more, delivering his best vocal performance up to that point. The other 3 band members, especially bass player Markus, continue to show how talented musicians they are.   The main drawback of this album was its thin production, but now this release offers a \\"remaster\\" of the original sound, thus a truly improved sound quality. The other drawback are tracks Pink Bubbles Go Ape, I'm Doing Fine Crazy Man and Heavy Metal Hamsters but the 4 Bonus Tracks make up for that one also (especially the memorable You Run With The Pack and the cover of Blue Suede Shoes).   You should definitely give this album a chance, if you enjoyed Helloween's previous releases, as you can hear how the band progresses and doesn't continue repeating itself for the sake of record sales.
B00007LTIA|5.0|The title of this review is a phrase once used to describe Wagner and his operas. Wagner aspired to something totally new in the history of music, a melding of literature, theatre, art, instrumentation and vocal wizardry that would leave the traditional concept of opera in the dust. It has been said that he failed at this task. All he managed was to leave behind a body of work that remains unparalleled in scope, grandeur, beauty  and timeless artistry. Great opera. As for the rest... well, who cares? <br /> <br />The same could be said for this two disk set. With the title song of their third album, Close To The Edge, Yes had taken the process begun with Roundabout to its most extreme development. The \\"song\\" had been pushed to its structural limits and could go no further. How do you top Close to the Edge? <br /> <br />What they reached for exceeded their grasp, at least with this work. More than any piece up to this point, Tales aspires to push beyond songs into the realm of serious composition, where music becomes something of a narrative force taking one through a whole cycle of experience: beginning, development, climax and denoument. You know, the kind of thing Beethoven did in his sleep.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, they weren't up to it; not yet, at least. Instead, they ended up with a kind of \\"Side Two of Abbey Road\\" on steroids: bits and pieces that might have been songs, but which, instead, with the help of connecting tissue and instrumental interludes, appear to be more. In the end, however, the sides tend to feel like bits pasted together, rather than coherent pieces with a single direction, purpose and energy flow. (They learned fast, however: on their next two albums they produced \\"Gates of Delirium\\" and \\"Awaken,\\" both of which capture that single-minded flow of energy, all parts focused on a single result, and thus remain their most sophisiticed creations). <br /> <br />All that said, this album works nothing less than pure magic on the listener. Because, you see, there are two versions of this production: the one contemplated in hindsight with the logical analysis of the critic, and the one you immerse yourself into as you listen. The second version blows the first out of the water. Forget all the negative terms you've heard about this work--bloated, too long, self-indulgent--as well as everything I've said thus far. Something happens when you shut the world out, put on the headphones and listen to the first sounds of the ocean blending into the guitar fade-ins, followed by the longest introductory passages ever written in Rock. The message is clear: this ain't your Top-40s rock, and don't go looking for any hits. This is \\"Sit down, shut up and listen!\\" music. Time takes on a different meaning and one ceases to appreciate the music; rather, one becomes part of the music. Yes has always been masterful at reaching for the big moment, and here, the big moments roll over you like waves in the ocean, one after the next, the music rising, falling, carrying you along for the ride with an inevitability that can't be described, only experienced. <br /> <br />Back in 1973, this was rock's absolute cutting edge. As the decade progressed, music took a different direction, and while many groups acknowledge the role YES played in setting a standard of musicianship and musical sophistication, few, if any,  who tried to build on what they established found success in the market place. And so these pieces, and the ones that followed on Relayer and Going For The One, remain perfectly preserved creations, unsullied by greater achievements of descendents who might have built on the foundations they forged, examples of a time when Rock as a species of serious music was still in its infancy and amazing things were possible to contemplate and achieve.  <br /> <br />Judge these four pieces not by what they don't accomplish, but what they do: beauty, virtuosity and breadth not to be seen again. This was when Rock, briefly, raised its head and began to awaken to its possibilities. Alas, this was not the dawn of an era but an all too brief flash of brilliance that no one, not even YES could sustain past the turn of the decade.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I have almost given up on good rock in the 2000's, but luckily there's always a band or album around the corner proving me wrong.  Most of the newer music I like in recent years has been mostly Euro electronic/synth/dance, with some guitars here & there, as well as liking what bands I liked from the 80s & 90s have put out.  Although Muse has apparantly been out for a while, they've only more recently gotten well known in the states.  The 1st song I heard of theirs was \\"Time is Running Out\\", or rather I saw the video either on MTV (late at night, of course) or on Yahoo Launch, & then checked out a few more songs.<br /><br />Too many good things about this album... First of all, you know there's something special when you instantly like an album, & not in that \\"like-oh-mi-gawd i-luv-this-song\\" instant gratification kind of way.  2nd, this album makes for GREAT driving music.  The songs have drive, & even the slower tracks have something captivating about them.  Another thing I like about this album is not all the songs sound the same.  You can also sing or hum along quite easily without feeling too overwhelmed by the guitars, which is one problem I have with a lot of newer rock bands - they've lost their ability to contain a memorable melody, or some of them don't hardly have one to begin with... just chunking chords with either some dude screaming or whining.  And, of course, this band's British... they always have it right over there anyway.  And with a perfect timing of an album around 45 minutes, it's not too long or short.<br /><br />1 - with that synthy beginning, what kind of album is this gonna be?  then the guitars come in... there ya go.<br /><br />2 - a little \\"new-wave\\" sounding, which of course I don't mind at all ;-)  This is really the only song on here like it, & seems a little happier sounding than the others; I like it a lot though.<br /><br />3 - this almost doesn't quite sound like them; it has a kind of \\"hip\\" sound similar to some music of today, but 10X's better.<br /><br />4 - definitely one of my favorites here; you feel like you're traveling very fast in some sort of portal<br /><br />5 - the pace slows down quite a bit; you'll have your head swaying slowly in no time though<br /><br />6 - kinda mid-tempo with a hypnotic drum beat<br /><br />7 - simply put, this song just ROCKS!!<br /><br />9 - cool bass line & backing strings<br /><br />10 - a slower track with a very familiar Spanish tinge; & you can't ignore the piano either<br /><br />11 - a good ending song that rocks; not sure if this is a single, but it has a video... yeeee-haw.<br /><br />As of now, I still have yet to hear all of their other albums, but I'm working on it ;-)  I'm really glad I got curious about this band.  Whether you've heard their other songs or not, if you even remotely like them, GET THIS!!!!  Definitely one of the best releases of 2006, & will be on constant rotation for me for a while.X's better. <br />4 - definitely one of my favorites here; you feel like you're traveling very fast in some sort of portal <br />5 - the pace slows down quite a bit; you'll have your head swaying slowly in no time though <br />6 - kinda mid-tempo with a hypnotic drum beat <br />7 - simply put, this song just ROCKS!! <br />9 - cool bass line & backing strings <br />10 - a slower track with a very familiar Spanish tinge; & you can't ignore the piano either <br />11 - a good ending song that rocks; not sure if this is a single, but it has a video... yeeee-haw. <br /> <br />As of now, I still have yet to hear all of their other albums, but I'm working on it ;-)  I'm really glad I got curious about this band.

B00003OSSL|5.0|I really liked the movie and I don't understand why some people didn't like it.  It shows the true emotions inside us and how we can be moved by extraordinary events in life.  Harrison Ford is a gem of an actor.  I also liked the acting of others.  I think I'll watch it again.
B000GPI15K|5.0|Although I'm the first to review this c.d. on Ammy, and although it's been on the market only for a short while, it has already received radically mixed reviews in the trade mags.  I've seen everything from \\"Brilliant:  The Most Original Jazz Album (especially from a jazz singer) in Years\\" to \\"A Bunch of Self-Indulgent Garbage.\\"<br /><br />After a few listens, I'm leaning slightly towards the position of Brilliant.<br /><br />Frankly, I bristle at the label of \\"self-indulgent garbage.\\"  Obviously, Ms. Barber has put far too much thought and study into this project for it to be dismissed so cruelly.  But besides that, there are some thought-provoking ideas in these lyrics.  I confess I haven't studied Joseph Campbell and the like carefully, so I can't vouch for her originality.  But parallels between Narcissus and Eve (as in \\"Adam and Eve\\"), and Oedipus and Jesus Christ, or Pygmalion and a lothario (possibly a pedophile?), are thought-provoking.<br /><br />But I'm an amateur music critic, not an amateur literature critic.  And what I have to say about the music is this:  It's brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Morpheus\\" and \\"Pygmalion\\" are gorgeous ballads.  The voicings and musical colorations in \\"Hunger\\", \\"Persephone\\" and \\"The Moon\\" are stunning.  And as much as I liked \\"Whiteworld\\" on Ms. Barber's \\"A Fortnight in France\\", it like it even more as an intro to the world of Oedipus.<br /><br />This is difficult music.  I don't recommend putting this in your c.d. changer while doing the dishes.  But a few trips through Ms. Barber's mythological world are worth the effort.  Recommended.  RC
006092988X|5.0|I read this book many years ago as a young woman and loved it. Now many years later, it still is a wonderful story of a young girl growing up surrounded by poverty but maintaining an innocence of heart.  There is not one ounce of cynicism in Francie's entire body; something that is rare today.   <br /> <br />I read many of the negative reviews from young people who have been required to read the book.  It is so difficult for them to get past the differences of today's age and then; however, hopefully some will have inspiring teachers who will be able to get them through the details enough in order to see the universal story of perseverance and strength of family.   <br /> <br />This book is not a page turner, has dated dialogue and writing style, and is probably not for everyone.  However, it is a warm, pleasant, inspiring read that should at least be tasted.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Tango: Zero Hour was the very first tango recording/CD I had ever heard. A friend of mine loaned it to me, not ever telling me exactly what Tango was- all I knew to think of was the dancers with the roses between their teeth, where the dancing was more dramatic than the music... So, my first mistake: having never heard tango. My second? Listening to it late at night in the dark. Music had never rocked my world quite like this... It was the most intense experience I had ever had with music. I was shocked. Wide-eyed. Taken aback. The version I had in my hands was the original with the liner notes, not the new shiny one that I now own (and that you can now buy), and the prose written on the card inside was enough to rip me in half without having ever heard the music. Tango: Zero Hour is not for the faint at heart. It is not for the light enthusiast. As the liner notes so eloquently said: \\"And suffer, Motherf*****. This is the Tango.\\"
0375831002|5.0|Don't let the young adult label keep anyone from reading this wonderfully written, imaginative, and compelling book that brings Nazi Germy alive.  Making Death the narrator puts an entirely different slant to any book on the war.  The characters are believable, the history is accurate, and the writing is clear and to the point yet descriptive and beautiful in places and chilling in others.

1594200823|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener. I've lived in rural areas, so I am no stranger to manure and corn fields and slaughterhouses. But I never saw the process food goes through from its rural beginnings to its ends on the shelves of Super Walmart. <br /> <br />I already knew that farm subsidies are not helping most farmers in the long run, and that we eat entirely too much corn syrup (which is not to be found in thin Europe or the southern half of the Americas.) I did not realize how intricately intwined these two issues were. I also did not realize how precisely cattle were fattened on corn and fed animal protein supplements and antibiotics to survive the process just long enough to be slaughter-sized.  <br /> <br />Agribusiness is making us fat, driving small farmers out of business, and degrading the environment, all in the name of efficiency and low cost. As the author points out, this is actually a very high price to pay for cheap corn. It would be better for us and for the planet if we more of our food locally, and preferably organically. We'd also cut our dependence on Middle East oil, which I don't think anyone can argue at this point would be a bad thing.  <br /> <br />The book makes all these points and more, which I would heartily agree with even were it a dry treatise. But the book was highly entertaining. It had me snickering at a few points, which was difficult to explain to my friends.  <br /> <br />\\"What is that book about that you're laughing?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"You've got to read this thing. It's about corn!\\"  <br /> <br />Seriously, highly recommended.

0767020308|5.0|I've just watched both movie versions of Emma, and this film is far and away the better of the two.  If you truly want to see Jane Austen's characters as she intended them, then get this film.  The setting and costuming is gorgeous, and the actors play the characters as they read in the original novel.  If you'd prefer a Hollywood version with weak men and dinghy women, get the Gweneth Paltrow version.
B000F8DT4Q|5.0|We all know how great this album was when it came out plus we all know the lyrics of every song in this. Everyone Wants to Rule the World, a very big anthem of the 80's, is just as pertinent today as it was 20 years ago, if not more. Just look at our President. My favorite song is Where you Are, a very reggae type piece that you want to hear over and over. That just makes you want to get your old Bambu and start partying once again. But since we're much older and know better, have a margarita instead and just keep cool with this awful summer heat as you listen to the wonderful voices and tunes of this once very popular duo. Ah, good memories!!! Guys, you need to come back with a vengeance and a new album. Everyone else has with quite a bit of success. The music public needs  and loves you.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Even though I've read all of Austen's novels and knew what was going to happen, this film kept me engrossed.  The actors truly became the characters of Austen's facinating novel.  I found myself actually disliking Anne's family and rooting for Ann and Wentworth to overcome all the obstacles to their romance.  This film is well worth owning.
B000000H66|5.0|First, for people who may have never heard Death before, there may be some unappealing preconceptions about this band that could cause people to dismiss them together.      With a name like Death, one may be lead to believe they are a typical death metal band.  It may be true that they founded the original death metal sound on their first couple of albums, but on their last four albums they transcended the genre entirely and were anything but death metal.  Death guitarist/vocalist, Chuck Schuldiner, is not the typical cookie monster, I'm-so-scary,  growler that most death metal bands employee.  Also, they aren't afraid to change the tempo within their songs which adds some dynamic power that no other death metal seems to have.  Some people say they became progressive metal which can also carry some negative connotations.  Cheesy wannabe opera singers like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate, who are representative of the prog metal scene, gave people plenty of reasons to make fun of the bands they did vocals for.    While the instrumentation is intricate and melodic, it isn't excessive, self-indulgent, or full of pretension like other progressive outfits.  Death melds together a series of mean riffs that flow right through your head and straight to your adrenaline glands.    The All Music Guide may state that \\"their riffs are beginning to grow tired\\" on \\"Symbolic,\\" as a justification for the album's three star rating, but nothing could be further from the truth.  The riffs are as crushing as ever on this album and the track \\"Zero Tolerance\\" features the best riffs the Schuldiner had yet written.  The building and releasing of tension in that songs will spin your head around like you were Linda Blair in The Exorcist.  The rest of the tracks on the album are equally unpredictable and [...] punches you right in the [...] every time your attention begins to fade.  Not one song sounds like filler even though the strongest tracks kick off the album.  All of these songs were waytoo heavy and intelligent for radio or MTV rotation, why would there be a few good songs with filler in between?    Death was the one metal band in the `90's that actually built on the blueprint that Metallica laid down in the `80's with their first four albums.  Unfortunately, not many people realized it while it was happening because heavy music wasn't in style.  Death was one of the true casualties of grunge.  To sum up things, I would like to quote the Shotgun Method when he said of Death, \\"they stomp colon.\\"  That's not an exaggeration because simply saying they kick booty is not enough.
B00005JO1R|1.0|\\"Walk The Line\\" was really crappy. Joaquin Phoenix did not look or sound anything like Johnny Cash at all and sometimes I forgot the movie was supposed to be about Johnny Cash until someone called him \\"Mr. Cash\\" or \\"Johnny\\". The story was your standard rags-to-riches-to-drug addict story you've seen in every movie about a real person ever.<br /><br />The movie is pretty depressing, and you really get the impression that whoever this guy is that is loosely based on Johnny Cash was a real sissy, so really the movie is incredibly inaccurate right there because Johnny Cash was totally not a sissy. In the movie he cries a lot and he takes a lot of pills and his career starts when apparently he just randomly decides to play the guitar and start singing, even though at no point in the movie do they ever show him learning how to do either of those things.<br /><br />There's a scene in a recording studio where Joaquin Phoenix absolutely destroys \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" so bad it's like the studio who made the movie hated the real Johnny Cash so much they wanted people who watched the movie to think he was possibly the worst singer ever. I mean it's bad. Like so bad it's \\"how did this stay in the movie?\\" bad.<br /><br />Not once in this movie did I think \\"Oh my God, Phoenix has totally become Johnny Cash!\\" at all. Mostly I was thinking \\"Why the heck is that guy from 'Signs' pretending he's Johnny Cash?\\" and hating him.<br /><br />I know Ray Charles worked a lot with Jamie Foxx for \\"Ray\\" when they made that, and Johnny Cash was dead when they made \\"Walk The Line\\", so Wa-Keen probably didn't get to spend any time with him. If his performance is any indication he didn't have a freaking clue who the hell Johnny Cash was before he read the script. If I was Johnny Cash I would rise from my grave and smash as many liquor bottles over Joaquin Phoenix's head as I could before my undead arms got tired and then I would bust him in the nuts with a pool cue and finally choke him to death with a guitar string. Then I would feast on his brains, because I'd be Zombie Johnny Cash and I'd still be ten times cooler than Joaquin Phoenix, no matter how many black suits he wears.<br /><br />This guy is so not Johnny Cash that in a couple of the singing parts it sounds like they had to electronically lower Phoenix's voice to try and get him to sound even a little bit like the real Cash. My girlfriend picked up on that too, and even she was laughing about it. You hear that, Joaquin Phoenix? Girls laugh at you. You're not a man.<br /><br />Robert Patrick plays Johnny Cash's father, and I was really hoping his arm would morph into a big spike \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\"-style and impale Joaquin Phoenix during one of the like three hundred scenes where the so-called Johnny Cash character gets drunk and embarasses his family.<br /><br />Either that, or maybe a scene where the real Johnny Cash shows up and fights the T-1000 with a guitar. Throw in a car chase and some singing, a scene where the real Johnny Cash throws Reese Witherspoon through a window and she lands head first in the windshield of a pickup truck the real Johnny Cash then douses in gasoline, lights on fire, and kicks off a cliff with his cowboy boots, and \\"Walk The Line\\" would have been so much better.<br /><br />Probably would have won that Best Picture Oscar, at least.death with a guitar string.

B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is Tool's major breakthrough work. Compared to its predecessors, Aenima is a completely different beast. It is a lot more complex and harder to digest. It may take months or even years to fully absorb it, and you are well advised to start with Undertow if you have never heard any Tool before. Once you've internalised their earlier work, you can come to Aenima and spend quite some time with it. Otherwise, like some people tend to do, you may just write them off as a pretentious act who are terribly overrated by their fan base, which would be a big loss for you.<br /><br />On Aenima, Tool continues to explore the depths of the human mind and soul, touching on themes such as pain, frustration, guilt, and social decay. As with every Tool album, the band puts forth thought-provoking lyrical messages in their songs, rendering them more powerful through creative musical passages and compositional ideas. Even though former bassist Paul D'Amour is now replaced by Justin Chancellor, the bass parts on this album do not lack a single thing. On the contrary, Chancellor's bass, along with Danny Carey's precise drum work, is still central to the songs, as Adam Jones mostly builds his guitars around his ferocious rhythms. Starting with \\"Stinkfist\\", the album opener, the bass sound is ever-present, deep and growling throughout its five-minute course, amidst crackling effects, cool percussion, and effect-laden guitar sounds all of which serve to highlight vocalist Maynard Keenan's light verse/heavy chorus dynamics.<br /><br />While I agree Tool's music is quite hard to decipher on first listen, the diversity in each song is astonishing. Each piece is defined by thick threads of colours and inventive instrumentation. The weird sounds and eerie percussion in the intro of \\"Eulogy\\" suggest a somewhat droney track, but with the arrival of a big bass motif and processed vocals, the tone escalates to impossible heights, resolving with a richly melodic chorus and dense guitar theme blanketing the almost incomprehensible spoken rants atop weird effects and clear bass lines. Maynard's singing is more versatile than both Opiate and Undertow combined. He goes from fragile low registers to tortured screaming on \\"H.\\" in order to match the flow of the song. This song has an amazing intro with awesome drumming and there is a killer guitar line in the middle where the same note is repeated over and over until it becomes addictive. This dreamy aura is then replaced as the band pick up pace and aggression towards the end.<br /><br />There are fifteen tracks on the album, but not all of them are songs per se. Some of the pieces have been put on the disc to enhance the unity, such as the static hissing of \\"Useful Idiot\\"; the weird piano track \\"Message to Harry Manback\\", where an Italian-accented immigrant who has allegedly been deported from the country relays a hateful message about the American government; the slightly goofy analog synths of \\"Intermission\\"; or the hysterically crying babies with sickening guitar feedback of \\"Cesaro Summability\\" are all pieces under the two-minute mark. The most interesting one of them all, however, has got to be track ten, \\"Die Eier Von Satan\\", which means \\"The Eggs of Satan\\". It begins with chunky bass and industrial beats, and the sound is incredibly huge. All of a sudden a guy with a strong East German accent begins to give the recipe for something which I fail to understand and after listing all the necessary ingredients he just says something along the lines of \\"Now put all these things and bake it in 200 degrees, just without the eggs of satan\\". I know it sounds weird, and it really is, but it contributes immensely to the band's artistic expression.<br /><br />On the more song-based material, \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" grooves hard in an almost post-punk sensibility with fast guitars and thick rhythms; whilst the way the keyboard riff on \\"Intermission\\" is interpreted on guitars on \\"Jimmy\\" is simply amazing. The bass and drums behind the guitars are stomping and the vocal melody is incredible. It is impossible not to see how much Dead Soul Tribe's Devon Graves has been influenced by this band. This is arguably the most overlooked song on Aenima, and its grinding riffage at the very end is crushing to say the least. Speaking of influences, the opening bass line of \\"Forty-Six & 2\\" must have certainly inspired Dream Theater when they were writing \\"Home\\". This is another song with sublime percussion, a gripping chorus, and swift chord progressions. The instrumental break highlights Danny Carey's prowess - he is perhaps the most creative drummer in rock today.<br /><br />The album also harbours the mystical \\"Pushit\\", something Tool would further explore on Lateralus; the killer title track with its snaky rhythms and socially observant lyrics; the dissonant \\"(-) Ions\\", complete with wind effects and numbing guitar drills. The CD ends on a curious note, with the almost fifteen-minute number \\"Third Eye\\", which starts with an excerpt from famous comedian Bill Hicks (to whom this album is dedicated) commenting on the positive effects of drugs on artists before delving deep into siren-like guitars, sparse drum beats, and the anti-song aesthetic of progressive rock instrumentation. Adam Jones' guitar work is at the centre of the piece, and he fearlessly unleashes an abrasive sonic assault, utilising tons of guitar feedback and somewhat tuneless interludes. Maynard's singing is intense and angry as he spews the lyrics with utter disgust, especially in the final verse.<br /><br />Aenima is one of the most important albums of the 90's. Again, I agree it's not for everyone, but one cannot deny its impact on all kinds of bands from all kinds of genres.
1400034779|2.0|The author in his time has written several children's books, and, well, actually this is a children's book as well. It reminds me most of any Disney story where Mickey Mouse and Goofy set out to catch a mastermind of some kind.<br /><br />On average, you'll have figured out the whole mystery about five pages before the heroine, Mma Ramotswe, has. Unless you're a seven year old, that is. Then you'll probably just about be solving mysteries alongside the lady detective.<br /><br />Unless you're annoyed by details like every second paragraph beginning with \\"She\\", you'll find this book an easy read. And there's no doubt the author knows Botswana/Southern African life and everyday language very well, and he demonstrates it through his writing. If you're a sucker for anything African, including the occasional crocodile and snake thrown into the story for no major reason at all, you'll like this book. If you're a grown-up and looking for something Agatha Christie-like, you will not.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|David Gilmour has no careerist reasons to make records any more; he makes music because he wants to.  The odd thing about this recording is that although it has a star-studded cast of helping hands (incl. Phil Manzanera, Crosby and Stills, Georgie Fame, and Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright), it sounds very intimate,  a pure expression of Gilmour's personal happiness.  As one might expect, it's very Floydian (think Meddle-era) but about as far removed from Roger Waters' paranoia as one could get.  People who require a high testosterone content to their CDs might get bored with the peaceful, contented soundscapes here, but for those of us who need a sonic oasis in the midst of a gangsta-rap desert planet, this is heaven.

0804106304|5.0|I loved this Amy Tan book, it's an easy read and will have you drawn in right away to the story.  This series written by Amy Tan is easily digestable and enjoyable to read, sometimes it's hard for me to engage a book but the books written by Amy Tan are so colorful and descriptive, it just draws me in and I can't stop reading.  This series is probably the best of it's series, diasecting the mother daughter relationship on such a delicate and complicated subject, a Chinese mother and an American born daughter who unknowingly lets the opportunity escape her to truly understand the intents and passions of her mother.  Bridged by communication gaps and difference in language styles and a mother who might be troubled with dimentia, this mother-daughter journey is plagued with mishaps and turmoil.  When June, the daughter, accepts new reason for her mother's off key personality, June offers too little too late and soon she has too many loose strings of her mother's past that she earlier dismissed as nonsense or retoric, to tie together to make sense.  June traces the pieces back to gain what her mother generously offered her in knowledge, but what becomes clear is the spirit of her mother lives inside of her as she comes to grips with who she is as a person and what her purpose in life is. I loved this book and have read almost the entire Amy Tan series. This book is the HINGE of all Amy Tan books, read this and you'll understand the others with new clarity!  LOVED IT!  WILL READ IT AGAIN!

0767817451|4.0|On an island atoll in the South Pacific, an atomic bomb was detonated, but the blast did more than raise a lot of water and a mushroom cloud.  It awakened a huge, dinosaur-like creature.  Now, the creature has set his sights on destruction and revenge.  The first to face the wrath of this terrifying creature is a Japanese freighter, which is shred to pieces.  All on board are killed, except for one man, who, in his state of shock, mutters the creature's name: Godzilla. <br /> <br />On the other side of the world, Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), is studying the effects of radiation on earthworms near the Chernobyl site.  He is met by members of the U.S. who are investigating the mysterious creature.  Soon, Niko is on his way back to the United States to assist in learning about the mysterious creature. Also interested in the investigation is Philippe Roache (Jean Reno), a member of the French CIA.  He's doing his own investigation of Godzilla. Meanwhile, Godzilla has come all the way from the South Pacific, through Panama, and finally to the banks of New York City.   <br /> <br />Once inside the city, Godzilla begins a reign of ruin, terror, and destruction the likes the city has never seen.  Unfortunately for Mayor Ebert (Michael Lerner), he's the one who'll have to deal with this menace.  To make matters worse for him, he's in the middle of a re-election campaign.  Ultimately, the military is called in, and the hunt begins for the monster.  Soon afterward, Niko arrives and quickly formulates a theory. Taking a blood sample from Godzilla's blood and testing it with a home pregnancy test, he finds out that Godzilla is pregnant. He also believes that Godzilla is looking for a place to nest.  If the eggs are allowed to hatch, the city could be overrun by hundreds of Godzilla's offspring.  He quickly urges the military to begin searching for the nest.  Not wanting to believe Niko's story, he is released from the case.  But, he joins forces with Philippe and hisgroup to continue the search for the nest. <br /> <br />During the pursuit, Niko encounters his old girlfriend Audrey (Maria Pitillo).  She is currently working as an assistant at the local news station.  She longs to be a reporter.  She runs into Niko when he's purchasing the pregnancy tests, and the two go back to Niko's tent.  There, she discovers a video with footage relating to Godzilla.  She takes it and sends it back to her station, hoping to look good in the eyes of her boss. <br /> <br />After much destruction and little success against Godzilla, the militaty is beginning to run out of options.  Godzilla's latest trick was to foil his pursuers by diving into the water and swimming away.  However, three submarines are waiting offshore and fire torpedoes at him.  Two hit and appear to have killed Godzilla, but is this really true?  Meanwhile, Niko and Philippe have discovered where the nest is.  Its in Madison Square Garden.  Now, Niko, Audrey, and Philippe must race against time to make sure the Garden is destroyed before these creatures can find their way out.   <br /> <br />Godzilla also proves he is far from dead as he smashes through the remains of the Garden.  Niko comes up with a plan to lure him onto the Brooklyn Bridge in the hopes of getting him entangled in the suspension wires.  Sure enough, his plan works.  Godzilla gets tangled and three fighter jets fire missiles into him.  Beaten, he falls to the ground.  But is this the end for Godzilla? <br /> <br />I found this to be a very entertaining movie.  The plot is very good.  Instead of destroying his usual Tokyo, New York bore the brunt in this movie.  The special effects are very good, especially the scene on the Brooklyn Bridge.  The acting is good, and Matthew Broderick is especially good as \\"the worm guy\\". <br /> <br />I recommend this movie highly.  If you're a fan of good science fiction, then this movie is one you'll definitely want to see.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|The violence is part of the human nature. Gaston Bouthoul' s impressive  essay published in the early seventies brings us forth interesting information; the major interval of peace along the mankind's history has been of two hundred years and along the 5000 years of history there just have been 400 years of absolute peace. The conclusion is more than obvious. The peace is a nostalgic idea, a marvelous product of the syncretism, conceived as the final sum of fragmented hopes, and has nothing to do with the human race. And Voltaire's acidic statement: \\"The civilization doesn't suppress the incivility, it just improves it.\\"<br /><br />If you expected just an incendiary movie, take your time and make a pause on the road. Spielberg' s approach turns around the slow and progressively psychological fragmentation of every one of the components of the apparently epic team that were hired to exterminate one by one the eleven intellectual leaders hat planned the unforgettable massacre in Munich 1972.<br /><br />So, under the perspective of more than thirty four years, the movie is a very zealous examination - told in documental style, through dramatic narrative ellipsis - around the dreadful events which took place with all the possible crudeness.<br /><br />According these established premises this handful of men will be hired in order to search and eliminate around every corner of Europe one by one the eleven terrorists. Despite certain inconsistencies in the script, we will witness how every one of the members of the Quintet simply will give up with such violence amount.<br /><br />Our main hero - Avner Kauffman - is happily married and his Jewish ancestors impede him to understand the huge challenge that this operation means. At the end he refuses to continue in this operation and he has realized the shed blood will not redeem the fallen victims; and on the other hand the violence is endless, that's why he simply decides to stop and initiate a new life with his wife and beautiful daughter in the Bronx. Ironically, in the final shot the fixed camera shows us the World Trade Center.<br /><br />No terrorism has philosophical justification. On the other hand the violence has no face, walks with velvet steps in order to select randomly some place in the world to make his designs come true. So under these coordinates, you fight against an invisible enemy, masked and hidden under the most unexpected conditions and keeping this paranoid state in the most people.<br /><br />Maybe this pacific statement in the final dialogue, advocating for the irrationality of this bloody revenge, was very brief leaving in the spectator's taste an unfinished anguish and a lot of unanswered questions. Perhaps this was the final intention; to make us understand the no sense of the revenge, but this is simply the edge of the iceberg. Don' t you?onx.

B00005JNRY|3.0|This is an okay film but you can see the take off of Doc Hollywood, which is not a problem in my books because Doc Hollywood was a nice film.<br /><br />In Cars we have Lightning McQueen a rookie race car with an attitude who sees himself as the next best thing since sliced bread.  Not only does he know it, he advertises it too so he's not really a likable character.<br /><br />He is so sure of himself he is more than happy to speed on the on the road, in his arrogance he thinks he is above the law so he when he crashes into the Hill Billy town of Radiator Springs and ends up causing lots of damage he is not too happy to be sentenced to do community service to pay his debt to society.<br /><br />Lightning isn't a happy car and he all he wants to do is get away from Radiator Springs but that is going to be easier said than done and you are not sure if community service is going to make any difference to Lightning whose dreams are of the big city, lights fame and racing.<br /><br />There is a star studded cast of voices, and they do a pretty good job, Paul Newman is great as the wise old Doc Hudson and you can't help smiling at Ramon, voiced by Cheech of Cheech and Chong.<br /><br />All in all a nice little film like I said earlier, quirky and fun but nothing spectacular when I think of other animated movies I have seen over the years, not really worth going to the movies to see unless you are a real fan of Disney/Pixar, and I guess the big screen does it justice but personally I'd wait for it to come out on DVD.
0307277674|5.0|In all honesty, I read the book so that I could see the movie - I was pained to see the hack job the movie did on John Grisham's \\"A Time To Kill\\", and didn't want to have my opinion of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" book unduly influenced by the movie. I also read \\"Angels and Demons\\", the first Robert Langdon (the main character of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\") first, and am glad I did so, as I preffered it.<br /><br />Like \\"Angels And Demons\\", Dan Brown fuses art, history and religion into a fast-paced thriller, taking us from the murder of the ranking members of a secret society (Priory of Scion), delving into hidden meaning in Leonardo Da Vinci's works, giving us a broad relgious history overview, before bringing us to the climactic finish in the United Kingdom. Again, the short chapters are a neat writing style which invites the reader to keep reading, often without realizing how much time has passed. I like the characters Dan Brown creates, his ability to create interest in art history and symbology, while at the same time creating a novel with many surprising twists.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure I understand the \\"this is an anti-catholic church\\" stance some take over this book. It is, after all, a work of fiction, which Dan Brown readily admits. Yes, he references real works of art and locations, but he uses them to lend more credibility to his work of fiction. The ultimate goal here, I believe, is not to point fingers at hidden agendas of anyone's faith (and I'm sure any organization, regardless of intent, has skeletons in their closets - look at the Spanish Inquisition, for example) nor is it to express belief in secret societies. Rather, I think, it's Dan Brown's intent to make us THINK. Take a few moments to ponder the \\"what if's\\".<br /><br />And let's face it with over 40 million copies sold, a major film made, countless books written to substantiate, refute or embellish his novel, not to mention the endless controversy, and statements by the Holy See of the Catholic Church...I'd say that Dan Brown has admirably achieved his goal, and surpassed it probably beyond his wildest expectations.<br /><br />So bearing all that in mind, and setting my own endorsement of this being a good book aside, as you're sitting there reading this, you should really be wondering whether you should even bother looking at the star rating this book has garnered.<br /><br />And if that isn't a sign of a good book, what is?Church...I'd say that Dan Brown has admirably achieved his goal, and surpassed it probably beyond his wildest expectations. <br /> <br />So bearing all that in mind, and setting my own endorsement of this being a good book aside, as you're sitting there reading this, you should really be wondering whether you should even bother looking at the star rating this book has garnered. <br /> <br />And if that isn't a sign of a good book, what is?
0446613444|4.0|Michael Connelly's novel The Black Ice features veteran LAPD detective Harry Bosch. This time Harry is investigating the death of \\"one of their own\\".<br /><br />Cal Moore, a narcotic's officer that Harry knew vaguely, is found in a motel bathroom with his head practically blown off by a shotgun and a suicide note in his pocket that read `I found out who I was'. When Harry is given the duty of notifying next of kin, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to Moore's wife, Sylvia, and the attraction builds slowly, albeit perhaps a bit too predictably.<br /><br />As Harry investigates an unidentified `Juan Doe' who seems to have a connection to Moore, one of Moore's partners gives him a file that Moore had been working on. It was a case involving `black ice', a deadly rock narcotic that had hit the streets.<br /><br />A series of murders in Hollywood and Mexico lead Harry to a Mexican drug lord Zorrillo, known to his compatriots as El Papa--the pope. Zorrillo is a man shrouded in mystery and death.<br /><br />From beginning to end, The Black Ice is full of action and suspense. The only thing lacking is perhaps a bit more warmth and emotion from Harry, who has lived the single life far too long. I'd like to see him have a real and deep relationship, instead of always the carefree bachelor kind.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still a great book by a great author. Fast-paced, technical in crime scene investigation and believable. This book kept me reading and wanting more.<br /><br />But it is the final three chapters that give you an unexpected twist and a final, explosive confrontation leads to death. The plot weaves through intricate subplots, with the familiar touch of a protagonist that is multi-dimensional in character. Harry Bosch has grown immensely in Connelly's last few novels. Looking forward to his next case.<br /><br />~ Cheryl Kaye Tardif<br />Author of Divine Intervention

0380973650|4.0|The aptly titled main character \\"Shadow\\" is released from prison and his life takes on a new meaning as he has encounters with various interesting characters.  This is the first full-length novel of Neil Gaiman's that I have read, but having been introduced to his work through the Sandman illustrated novel and the movie \\"Mirror Mask\\", you can see how this fits right in with the themes he feeds on, which are the broad canon of mythology and how Gods would look on humanity today, if only we could hear them.<br /><br />What I was very impressed by was the writing style of Neil Gaiman.  The book moves quickly and the large variety of characters come through very colorfully.  He has a way with throwing a few quick details in that define a character quickly.  He also writes dialogue as well as any other author around.<br /><br />The few drawbacks of the novel are that parts of it move too quickly and don't have the consistent high level of writing that it shows in parts.  Also, a familiarity with the large canon of gods is helpful as the many names that get thrown around are easily confused. I would highly recommend it if you have enjoyed other Neil Gaiman writing or if you like Stephen King's heavier work like the Dark Tower series or The Stand.
B000G759LW|3.0|I was really looking forward to Christina Aguilera's forthcoming CD when I heard she was working on a new recording. I expected something of the magnitude of STRIPPED, and my expectations have falledn flat. Incidentally, I think that STRIPPED is one of the best written material of this entire decade. BACK TO BASIC falls short of this. Unfortunately, I spent energy looking forward to what became less-than-appealing material for me.  <br /> <br />Everything I have read and heard from interviews with Christina about this CD is that it was going back to the roots of the 20s-50s era. Disc 2 does go there!  <br /> <br />I think the CD would have gotten a higher rating from me had the entire CD consisted of that disc alone. Lyrically, while the material is not as strong, as her previous release, the second disc winks at the era of the 20s, 30s and 40s. Not a whole lot of deep wording, but heartfelt. This is what Disc 2 achieves...a la Christina (a little naughty at times, but fun). Disc 1 does still show some maturation, but no more than what we got used to with STRIPPED. Comparatively, it is more of a let down. <br /> <br />CANDYMAN is great example of what this entire album should have sounded like.  Some may think it would be too much of the same, but that is exactly what disc 1 is about...in addition to not sounding like it came from the 20s-50s era. There is minimal influence per se, though those years led to what the 70s became, which is transfused throughout Disc 1. <br /> <br />That one does something very clever, namely introducing little snippets of songs that influenced Christina's choice. Unfortunately, with one, it is fine. More than that creates too often a cacophonic symphonia of unbearable enjoyable background music with the same beat. Noisy! And noisy is not good when you possess as great a voice as Christina's!  <br /> <br />It seems to me that she's taken the route that Mariah Carey has been on with I don't know how many contributors to one song... Everheard of too many cooks in the kitchen? This would apply here. Where Mariah's great voice has not really been used to its full potential over the past 10 years or so, Christina sounds stronger than ever... I actually wish something a little more subdued at times. We know she can belt a song like the best of them. She is one of the best today! <br /> <br />Disc 1 has a couple of tracks that appeal to me. The rest all sounds the same. Is it bad? Not if you like 70s soul (different from 60s soul to me, which seems to go deeper into...well, one's soul).  <br /> <br />I found that F.U.S.S was cleverly written, and sends the obvious message to Scott Storch (S.S.) who co-wrote all the songs mentioned in this track on STRIPPED with Christina. I guess he stopped \\"getting it\\" in her eyes. I am wondering whether she \\"still cherishes the memories she made with him\\" as mentioned in the thank you note of that album! Maybe she should have listened to Scott a little bit with regards to some of the tracks. <br /> <br />Overall, I did not give less than 3*** thanks to Christina's voice. She also co-wrote all of her songs, which is rare today, especially someone that young, though nothing new transpired, and lyrically, the end-result is weaker overall. Great voice too good for most of the material. <br /> <br />The good tracks are on Disc 1: UNDERSTAND and SLOW DOWN BABY. F.U.S.S. is different lyrically. The message makes it interesting though! The rest is so-so! Disc 2 offers highlights like CANDYMAN and MERCY ON ME. If any of these songs were released as singles, people may come to buy this CD more readily. I don't think it will do as well as STRIPPED (18 million copies), but I am willing to be proven wrong. I wish her well, but I am not sold on BACK TO BASICS.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|This is a good movie. Syriana captures the total confusion I think we all feel when digesting current events. The acting is pretty average, but the camera work & cinematography is first rate. My problem is it just doesn't go far enough to really say anything or show the real deal behind the scenes. Except for the scene ehen George Clooney returns to the CIA to find himself persona non grata' (the best scene in the movie because it seems so real)there isn't enough there there to be a classic. Still, it is worth seeing & sadly it is better than 75% of the mainstream movies out there today. What does that say about us?

B00005JP87|4.0|When a dazzled audience watches a magician at work, the one question that goes through everyone's mind is, \\"How did he do that?\\" It's interesting such a question would be raised at all, considering most of us really don't want to know; we mentally examine the methodology behind the illusions, yet we understand that if the secrets are revealed, the greatness of the moment is lost. It's a good thing most professional magicians refuse to be so open; giving away an illusion's secret reduces entertainment to a mere technicality. The same can be said for movies, specifically movies about magic. The television ads for \\"The Illusionist\\" tell the viewers to not give away the film's secret. True to its word, it does have more than a couple of tricks up its sleeve. And much like a magic trick, each sequence builds on another until a rather elaborate twist ending is reached. At that point, the audience is completely wowed.<br /><br />I say this in spite of the fact that it's not the most original of twist endings. The story is also a bit formulaic, relying on well-established characterizations and assumable outcomes for advancement. However, I found that I could look past these shortcomings; it's quite an entertaining film, effectively mixing mystery with a solid romance. There are also some very good performances, no small feat considering all three leads had to fake believable European accents. It was especially surprising in terms of Edward Norton; his role called for a suave, sophisticated demeanor, pretty much to the point of seeming emotionless. I initially had my doubts that he could pull it off. But as with many of his other roles, he's proven himself capable of rising to the occasion.<br /><br />Based on Steven Millhauser's short story \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\\" the film's components are loosely like those of a fable. Fables are often basic, using shorter formats and simpler language as a way of conveying a moral to a wide audience. While \\"The Illusionist\\" has no moral, it does make use of tried and true storytelling methods to get its point across. We have the forbidden love between two classes of people and what they endure in an attempt to live happily ever after. We have the villain who will stop at nothing to keep the incurable lovebirds apart. We have the clever, handsome, enigmatic hero. We have the skeptical side characters. Most importantly, we have entertaining acts of illusion that deceive us just as much as they deceive the characters.<br /><br />The plot in and of itself is constructed less like a fable and more like a mystery novel. Set in early twentieth century Vienna, the story centers on the mysterious stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a man whose grace and charm can bewitch an audience the moment he steps on stage. He was first introduced to magic as a teenager (played by Aaron Johnson). Back then, he was nothing more than the peasant son of a cabinet maker. Then one day, he meets a wandering magician sitting under a tree. From then on, he's a completely different person, devoting all his free time to perfecting the art and craft of magic tricks. And what a time to learn; his skills attract the attention of Sophie von Teschen (played as a teenager by Eleanor Tomlinson), a wealthy young girl of high social stature. As you can probably imagine, the enevitable romance is strictly forbidden. Ultimately, the two are forcefully separated.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Eisenheim is back in Austria after having travelled the world in the study of magic. He is rapidly becoming one of the country's most popular illusionists, thrilling audiences with his impeccable sense of timing and style. He can make an orange tree grow from an empty pot. He can make a reflection behave differently than the real person. He can even make coins appear out of a red handkerchief. Word of his astounding illusions quickly reaches Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), the arrogant, immature successor to the throne of Austria. He decides to attend one of the magician's shows. However, it's not because he wants be entertained; rather, he wants to expose Eisenheim as a fraud by purposely trying to poke holes in the act. It would seem that only he has such an agenda. Everyone else, he's astonished to discover, is actually willing to enjoy the show.<br /><br />At this point, the plot thickens dramatically. The Prince's intended is none other than Sophie von Teschen (now played by Jessica Biel), and when attending the performance with her fiancee, she finds herself assisting Eisenheim in one of his tricks. Right away, the two recognize each other from their childhoods, and old feelings resurface. The two begin an intesnse love affair, one the audience knows will end very badly if discovered. Unfortunately, Leopold rules everything with an iron fist, especially when it comes to marriage. Bodyguards and spies keep a close eye on Sophie on a regular basis, and her romance with Eisenheim is impossible to conceal.<br /><br />Determined to ruin the magician's reputation, Leopold hires Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to keep Eisenheim at bay. Uhl is of a shrewd and practical sort, always looking for the most logical explanation when conducting an investigation. He applies himself fully when it comes to deconstructing Eisenheim's tricks, which are impressive to say the least. At times, Uhl's rational mind is overshadowed by the need to believe; never mind logic and reason. Throughout the course of the film, it becomes one of his most challenging obstacles, and he's eventually forced to choose between loyalty to his country and the desire to expose the truth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't describe any more of the plot. Keep in mind that this is a mystery, and far too many important details--ones that directly relate to the plot twist--are at stake. What I can say is that Eisenheim's simple sleight-of-hand illusions are eventually discarded for the ability to call forth dead spirits. This ability earns him a devoted following, one that puts a serious damper on Uhl's investigation and Leopold's vindictiveness. Like in all good mysteries, it eventually becomes a matter of putting the pieces together to form a clear picture.<br /><br />I realize that the previous paragraph was incredibly vague, but short of giving everything away, there's really no other way to say it. I'd rather you go and see the film for yourself. There's so much about it that works, especially the final scenes; they're appropriately sequenced, serving as a testament to the trickery magicians are known for. A lot of audiences don't like being fooled at the movies these days; they seem to think that fooling is only appropriate in live magic shows, where they actually look forward to asking, \\"How did he do that?\\" Not only does \\"The Illusionist\\" have all the best qualities of a live magic show, it also effectively reinterprets the classic Love Conquers All fable. I enjoyed this movie; it's clever, it's sneaky, and it delightfully toys with the audience's beliefs.ician's shows. However, it's not because he wants be entertained; rather, he wants to expose Eisenheim as a fraud by purposely trying to poke holes in the act. It would seem that only he has such an agenda.

Unfortunately, I can't describe any more of the plot. Keep in mind that this is a mystery, and far too many important details--ones that directly relate to the plot twist--are at stake. What I can say is that Eisenheim's simple sleight-of-hand illusions are eventually discarded for the ability to call forth dead spirits. This ability earns him a devoted following, one that puts a seriousdamper on Uhl's investigation and Leopold's vindictiveness. Like in all good mysteries, it eventually becomes a matter of putting the pieces together to form a clear picture.     I realize that the previous paragraph was incredibly vague, but short of giving everything away, there's really no other way to say it. I'd rather you go and see the film for yourself. There's so much about it that works, especially the final scenes; they're appropriately sequenced, serving as a testament to the trickery magicians are known for. A lot of audiences don't like being fooled at the movies these days; they seem to think that fooling is only appropriate in live magic shows, where they actually look forward to asking, \\"How did he do that?\\" Not only does \\"The Illusionist\\" have all the best qualities of a live magic show, it also effectively reinterprets the classic Love Conquers All fable. I enjoyed this movie; it's clever, it's sneaky, and it delightfully toys with the audience's beliefs.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|This is a light, romantic, fun (and poignant) film that all ages can enjoy, much like the Richard Lester Three Musketeers films. That it received an R rating from the clueless idiots at the MPAA is testimony to their irrelevance, and you may see a resemblance between the baddies in \\"Cassanova\\" and the MPAA itself. That said, this one's a gem - for everyone and anyone!
B00004U2GH|5.0|This was one of the first albums I owned on Vinyl, and I loved it but there were parts that didnt make any sense.  Now with the full concert on CD, with no censorship of the dialogue, it all makes sense and is just as enjoyable an album.
B000G759LW|2.0|No. These aren't the basics. This is more of Christina Aguilera's trademark belting/oversinging style. Granted, \\"Back to Basics\\" is probably Christina's best, most accomplished album, but it's also a load of overblown nonsense. Christina desperately tries to capture the big band, jazz/soul stylings of, let's say, Ella Fitzgerald, but comes off as just that; someone from today trying to do a sound that is not suited for her. Therein lies the biggest problem for this album, Christina can't pull off this style of music, despite all her efforts. She's a talented vocalist, yes, but her vocals are not suited for this stuff.<br /><br />Then there's other times where she backpedals, so as not to displease any of her fans, affirming that she's \\"Still Dirrty\\" and encouraging men to \\"Taste her sugar.\\"  Are these \\"The Basics?\\"  I somehow doubt it.<br /><br />Additionally, \\"Back to Basics\\" is a 2-disc release, which in itself begs for a couple songs to be cut. What's worse, however is that disc to only contains a couple songs, all of which could have fit on disc one. So why disc 2? A video feature. Honestly, why disjoint your album so grossly when its capable of being on one disc? I don't understand.  Even without the enhancement of disc two, there are too many songs on here and it often feels like it's too much to handle all at once.<br /><br />Like I said, this is her best album, and it seems as if she's finally come into her own, but seriously, this is bullcrap. It's far from her teen-pop roots, and a step in the right direction, but Christina should realize what her strengths are, her voice and beauty, and exploit them in a manner to which they are best suited. Unfortunately, this is not it.<br /><br />Recommended for Christina Aguilera fans, or anyone with time to kill.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Back In the Day\\"<br />2. \\"Ain't No Other Man\\"<br />3. \\"Candyman\\"<br /><br />2 out of 5 Stars
B000001ESP|4.0|Review no. 254. Classic 1981 Rush catalog title. No doubt about it. This (among a few others) was the album that catapulted the Canadian power trio to superstar status. Just all around good arena rock. Still say that \\"Tom Saywer\\" and \\"Limelight\\" have been WAY over-played. My two favorites off this record always has been and always be \\"Witch Hunt\\" and the awesome \\"Red Barchetta\\". Not every band can play this sort of music with orchestral-like arrangements included in their work, like Rush can. A should-have.
B000G8NVHA|3.0|Anyone who really knows me knows that I'm a HUGE JAZZ FAN.  I also happen to be a fan of Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" Album. So when I heard she was releasing a Jazz record I was EXTRA HYPED. I absolutely loved her duet \\"A Song For You\\" with Jazz Master Herbie Hancock on his album \\"Possibilities\\" and the first single \\"Ain't no other Man\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed upon listening to the first couple of songs. THIS IS NOT A JAZZ ALBUM, not even close, it is more of a HIP-HOP/SOUL ALBUM. They're a couple of songs that have portions of Jazz influence like \\"Slow Down\\", \\"On Our Way\\", \\"Still Dirrty\\", \\"Candy Man\\", \\"I Got Trouble\\", & \\"Mercy on Me\\", but nothing in this album reminds me of any Jazz or Blues legends from the 20's 30's, or 40's.<br /><br />I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS A BAD ALBUM; IT ACTAULLY IS GREAT IN ITS TRUE ELEMENT OF HIP-HOP/SOUL. They are even some songs that will finally bring Christina the artistic acknowledgement she should have received with \\"stripped\\". The one noticeable bad thing is that Christina seems to be recycling the same message from \\"Stripped\\": Feminism, Abuses, and being \\"Dirrty\\", but with a bit more love songs. I guess you can say this is \\"Stripped II\\" but softer (STRIPPED IS MORE EDGER).<br /><br />I'm greatly disappointed because I WAS EXPECTING AN AUTHENTIC JAZZ SOUND AND SHE DIDN'T DO THAT!!!! Christina had the opportunity to revise Jazz & bring it to the hip-hop generation. Sadly, that generation will continue to be soulless and never appreciate real music. I've barely listened to this album and maybe I'll be back in a couple of weeks or months praising its genius. BUT FOR ME, there's nothing new thats brought to the table with this project..... Quoting Madonna \\"I heard it all before, I heard it all before, I heard it all before,I heard it all before....\\"<br /><br />If you're looking for true Jazz & Blues influence albums, check out these titles:<br /><br />*ME'SHELL NDEGEOCELLO - DANCE OF THE INFIDEAL<br /><br />(The album Miles Davis would have done if he were alive today)<br /><br />*HERBIE HANCOCK- POSSIBLITIES<br /><br />(A Jazz, Blues, & Soul Musical collaboration with Christina, John Meyer, Annie Lennox, Sting, Paul Simon, Joss Stone, Santana & show cased their true artistic possibilities)<br /><br />*CASSANDRA WILSON- THUNDERBIRD<br /><br />(Blues mixed with every sound)<br /><br />*GEORGE MICHAEL- OLDER<br /><br />(Only pop star that was willing to merge both pop and jazz and mix it with 90'sound)<br /><br />*LIZZ WRIGHT - SALT<br /><br />(Amazing debut from a 20 year old Georgia sing venturing into Blues, Gospel, & Jazz)<br /><br />*MICHAEL BUBLE' - MICHAEL BUBLE'<br /><br />(Classic Sinatra/Big band sound)<br /><br />*Queen Latifah - The Dana Ownes Album<br /><br />(The queen does an execellent job in remaking many classics and makes them her own)<br /><br />*EMMA BUNTON - FREE ME (EX-BABY SPICE)<br /><br />(Its more of a 50's & 60's Pop/Swing/Jazz/Bossa Nova influence CD, surprising good)ELLO - DANCE OF THE INFIDEAL  <br />(The album Miles Davis would have done if he were alive today)  <br /> <br />  <br />*HERBIE HANCOCK- POSSIBLITIES <br />(A Jazz, Blues, & Soul Musical collaboration with Christina, John Meyer, Annie Lennox, Sting, Paul Simon, Joss Stone, Santana & show cased their true artistic possibilities) <br /> <br />*CASSANDRA WILSON- THUNDERBIRD  <br />(Blues mixed with every sound)  <br /> <br />*GEORGE MICHAEL- OLDER  <br />(Only pop star that was willing to merge both pop and jazz and mix it with 90'sound)  <br /> <br />*LIZZ WRIGHT - SALT  <br />(Amazing debut from a 20 year old Georgia sing venturing into Blues, Gospel, & Jazz)  <br /> <br />*MICHAEL BUBLE' - MICHAEL BUBLE'  <br />(Classic Sinatra/Big band sound)  <br /> <br />*Queen Latifah - The Dana Ownes Album <br />(The queen does an execellent job in remaking many classics and makes them her own) <br /> <br />*EMMA BUNTON - FREE ME (EX-BABY SPICE) <br />(Its more of a 50's & 60's Pop/Swing/Jazz/Bossa Nova influence CD, surprising good)  <br />
0553588486|5.0|Game of Thrones is the first book of the intense Song of Fire and Ice series.  George RR Martin has created a world full of gritty people, political chaos and plots that intertwine that keep you turning pages long into the night.  I've actually purchased multiple copies and given them to friends to get them started with the series. Every one of them has been hooked!
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|This is a well made movie. It is enjoyable. But once again, we are asked to believe that the largest threats to our way of life come not from radical muslims and left wing loonies like Hugo Chavez, but from Christians, and from business corporations. The only truly free civilizations on this planet have come from the combination of those two entities. And now, they are supposed to be the bad guys in so many movies and comic books. What mischief is this causing to our culture?
0393035158|5.0|A must read for every human being.  <br /> <br />With uncommon brilliance, Sam Harris strikes a fatal blow to the idea that beliefs can be harmlessly sanctioned by anything other than the same evidence we require of any other claims about reality. Unless we take Sam Harris' stark warning about our mass abandonment of the rational spirit of post-enlightenment modernity seriously, we will all suffer the torments of a very earthly hell.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is an epic, powerful book of hope, despair, suffering and permission for humanity to fulfill it's potential. This may sound dramatic but East of Eden is one of the most thoughtful books I have ever read. The level of depth that is so subtly put into the book has a profound impact on the reader: the idiosyncraties of life, which we so often take for being individual to ourselves are really vividly shown to be universal. The book isn't so much a novel but a treatise on human nature and a philosophy for life. This is a big claim so I'll try and justify it. But really, this is a book that needs to be experienced rather than read so any review is only a shallow representation.  <br /> <br />It takes a novelist of Steinbeck's skill to pull the deep philosophising off in a non-condensending or patronising manner. Yet, he handles the book beautifully, the philosophy comes from two very strong and intriging characters, Samuel and Lee, both outsiders beloved by those close to them who are able to advise the other characters and, by proxy, the reader too. Through these characters' strong voices, the other actors are guided through their lives, the stregth of hope that they give out is the difference between life and death for some characters. The ideas of the book are obvious when read but stay with the reader and offer a simple approach to a lives beset by complications - put simply, you may do what you want in life, you learn for yourself and although help and strength may be offered by other people, ultimately you are responsible for your own life. And for whether you are satisfied when death takes you.  <br /> <br />The book is strong in many areas, such as the depth of knowledge gained about American history and the American psyche, the deep love shown to its people and the strong, interesting characters, shown extra love in their crafting because many are based on Steinbeck's own family. However the level of detail in the book slows down the narrative tremendously: this isn't a novel that can be rushed through without missing the crux of the book; the contemplative tone means that it will always be a slow read. The plot is also quite simplistic and easily predictable. It could be reduced to a few lines but in doing so the fine details and love that is so apparent in the book would be lost. The plot is secondary to the environment, characters and, above all, to the ideas of the book.  <br /> <br />If this type of book sounds intriging to you, please buy or borrow it quickly, as it will be a book that you won't forget for a long time and offers the reader a lot. Despite the heaviness of the topics and some of the vindictiveness shown by some characters, the book leaves the reader in hope rather than despair by the end. Even if it doesn't sound appealing and the size of the book puts you off you should try this book. It is a rare masterpiece and one which will be as relevant in 100 years as it is now with much wisdom on offer to any reader, regardless of their world experiences.
B00005B4GU|3.0|I don't know if heroin is a prereq for this album, but I don't do it so I listened without. If they are trying to capture what is like to be finding a vein by an old railroad track near dilapidated factory in Liverpool, and rolling around in your own vomit, than I think they succeeded. They still rock though.
B00005JKES|5.0|Seriously.    This was my favorite show when it was on. Now I love it all over again. But I refuse to shell out for the VHS copies of season 2. I've heard time and again that they're not great quality and they look like they're split up into different packs...well, anyways.    I WANT SEASON 2 ON DVD. I've been waiting for YEARS.     I hope someone reads this that gives a nudge to distribution and production. There IS a demand. Where's the product? :)    EDITED TO ADD: Oh, great. Well, guys, it looks bad. The DVD distributor for Season 1 was Republic Pictures, which (along with numerous other studios such as Orion) appears to have gone under.  Same with the distributor for the VHS episodes (Worldvision HV Inc.) It might be an even longer wait than we'd like to hear, if no major studios have bought the catalogs.     And it doesn't look like they have. Warner Brothers picked up \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\\", and Paramount was *rumored* to be picking up season 2 back in 2004, but it's not listed in their catalog. Nor is it listed in the catalog for WB, Sony Pictures, or MGM.     Geez. Now I'm bummed.    EDITED TO ADD IN MARCH 2007:    YAY! Season 2 will be released on DVD in April 2007. Rejoice!
0790744295|5.0|Creepshow is one of the best horror films of the 80's.George A.Romero and Stephen King are the perfect team as they weave five hillarious and often creepy stories. <br /> <br />Story 1:Father's Day <br />It's Father's Day and Bedelia always comes back to visit her father's grave after brutally murdering him.But not this year.This year,Nathan Grantham has a surprise for Bedelia as he kills her and the rest of her family,seeking his father's day cake he didn't get on his last Father's Day.Soon,Nathan finds a replacement,and it's not what we expected. <br /> <br />Story 2:The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill <br />When a meteor hits near redneck Jordy Verill's house,he accidentely splits it in half,dumping the wastes all over his grass.Soon,the entire property is covered in the green stuff,including Jordy himself.Now,Jordy must find a solution before perishes in his own mistake. <br /> <br />Story 3:Something to Tide you over <br />Leslie Nielson makes his debut as Richard,a vengeaful husband who seeks revenge on Harry,them na his wife was having an affair with.So,he lures them down to the beach and buries them neck-deep in the sand,near the shore.Soon,the tide finshes both of them off and Richard believes his troubles are over.But the dead don't really stay quiet,or do they? <br /> <br />Story 4:The Crate <br />A 300 year old crate is found at the bottom of some stairs at a University,and soon,Professor Stanley unleashes an ancient creature that kills two people and is now running loose in the University.Now,only Henry can help the delerious professor by getting rid of the thing.But not before disposing of his nagging wife,who's got quite a surprise coming to her. <br /> <br />Story 5:They're creeping up on you <br />Upson pratt's having bug problems,but not ordinary ones.Soon,his\\"germ-proof apartment\\"is running rampant with the filthy roaches,and it's not a problem that an ordinary exterminator can deal with.Can Upson live through the night,or will he succumb to the bug's wrath? <br /> <br /> <br />You have to get this film.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|In the latest film from the Wachowski brothers viewers are given a visually stunning look at an alternate future in which a naziesque British government becomes the target of one man's brutal vengeance campaign. Hugo Weaving plays V, the masked avenger to whom an obtrusive failed coup 400 years ago on November 5th plays apocalyptic importance. Natalie Portman co-stars as Evey, an innocent bystander who becomes entangled in V's plan and ultimately finds  herself in love with him (even though he nearly tortures her to death in one of the odd subplots that just doesn't work).<br /><br />The movie is filmed with earnestness and vision, blending flawless special effects with a thought-provoking story about freedom, vengeance, the role of government, the importance of individuality, and the quest for truth despite the consequences. However, rather than rise to the occasion, the Wachowski brothers take a detour into using the movie to make social statements that seem to be added not because they are organic to the story, but because they are important to the filmmakers:<br /><br />* Those who believe in God are cruel, repressive, homophobic and hypocritical. This caricature becomes so overbearing you eventually think you're watching a propaganda film rather than an action-adventure.<br /><br />* The ends justify the means for individuals but not for governments.<br /><br />* Vengeance, including terrorism and mass murder, is acceptable as long as you were disfigured years ago at a top-secret government facility.<br /><br />* Mercy and forgiveness are weaker moral responses to injustice than murder, torture and revenge are.<br /><br />In the end, the movie is a letdown as it becomes encumbered with trying to make a point rather than tell a story and viewers are left feeling like they're supposed to be cheering for a victory that seems like a defeat. Let the Wachowski brothers have their Vendetta against society and watch `The Matrix' instead.
1573229725|5.0|This book, like the BBC Production which is available on DVD, are both 2 of the most wonderfully written book and screenplay.

I, and a lot of others, believe it is a flawless recording that fits the time period perfectly.  If you'd rather listen to Buckley or whoever, fine.  Just don't spew out ridiculous statements of how horrible Lee's voice is (and Buckley sound like Nat King Cole right?), how awful the instruments sound, how horrid the lyrics are.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|A science fiction film with a message. Who would've thought it possible. I don't mean this has never happened, it's just that it hasn't happened in quite some time. To put it in perspective, my favorite SF film was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil. I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own \\"good\\" rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve.<br /><br />Coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track. The first third of the film was pretty slow and involved, but the latter parts made up for this.<br /><br />The story is about a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) who was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company. A group of men and women have hidden their involvement with this distasteful part of history as we lunge forward to the year 2020. A totalitarian government rules England, cowing its citizens by enforcing curfews, limiting religious freedoms, and eliminating homosexuality (if you're a gay Buddhist out after nine p.m. you're in BIG trouble!)<br /><br />Weaving a bit of history into the story, we see Guy Fawkes Day (November 5th) taken to a whole new level. V plans to destroy Parliament because of its wickedness and the fear under which English citizens now live. Not to mention that Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt, CONTACT) is one of the pharmaceutical founders that altered V's life forever; V has no recollection of his past, including his own name, and has an altered body chemistry allowing him superhuman agility thanks to the drugs that were tested on him. This is very bad news for those involved in screwing up his life. V is out for Vengeance, too.<br /><br />But V is also lonely, so when Evey (Natalie Portman, STAR WARS III) helps him make good an escape, he pulls her into his confidence, eventually forcing her to lose all her fears through a set of brutal tests. In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.<br /><br />In a stunning climax, we watch V's vision come to life, as fireworks blow, thousands turn out wearing Guy Fawkes/V masks, and Evey comes to understand how important change is in the world.<br /><br />This film certainly won't be for everyone. You have to think about what's happening to really understand the message. It doesn't smack you in the face with an obvious plot, and instead lets it seep into the viewer's subconscious.<br /><br />There are, as seen in other reviews, a lot of talk about what this film's intent was supposed to be, and I think that speaks pretty highly for the level of sophistication needed to help one grasp V. Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? Anyone who wants to destroy a government must be crazy and/or an anarchist, right? How far is too far when a government wants to \\"protect\\" its citizens? These are questions the movie poses but doesn't give answers to, and that is quite refreshing considering what Hollywood usually places in front of us (A + B = C).

B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that we have been waiting to be rereleased.  If you enjoyed it in the 60's you'll enjoy it now.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Wow! I saw this movie as a teenager when it was released and couldn't pass this up. The DVD experience with the associated clips was awesome! In my mind, this is the best racing film ever recorded ... the attention to detail, the filmography, and the realism are hard to fault.  <br /> <br />Is it a bit too dramatic? Probably ... but given the lethality of the sport in the mid-1960's it's not too much of a stretch. <br /> <br />This is a must-own for any real car enthusiast! It's one I watch over and over at least once a month.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I sort of stumbled across this movie accidentally.  Hadn't ever heard of it before.  I really enjoyed watching this film.  I found it extremely funny.  Even though the humour isn't laugh out loud, pee your pants, it's still very funny.  This is one of those movies I will watch over and over and never get tired of it.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Having never seen this film before, I was in no position to be impressed by the improved sound or video quality. And having read many of the reviews I was in a sweat of anticipation to finally see this film. Sometimes reading such positive reviews can create over-expectation, and this is what I was most concerned about. I've had that with Roger Waters' In the Flesh and also Pink Floyd's Pulse. This expectation was all the greater as I rate Who's Next as the single greatest album of all time. There is not a note in the wrong place. How can you better that? <br /> <br />So it was with some trepidation I shoved in disk 1. This was made even worse by my 9-year old daughter occasionally coming into the room to laugh at the 'gay guy' singing. This standing joke began with them seeing Mick Jagger in Rock 'n Roll Circus and my kids now routinely mock every 60s band I watch - but it doesn't stop them watching in fascination. <br /> <br />In the end I wasn't disappointed. Quite the contrary. Usually, no matter how good a performance is I rarely watch it all the way through at one sitting - there's just too much else to do. This time I did, and even more rarely it left me wanting much more by The Who. <br /> <br />I've always been very selective about The Who - I don't have much of their pre-Tommy stuff, except a compilation, or their post-Quadrophenia. <br /> <br />But this film demonstrated that they are not a by-numbers band. I hadn't expected them to be an improvisational band, but this DVD has several renditions of the same song and each was worth watching, and were better than the studio version. I've already seen 30 Years of Maximum R&B, and was really divided as to which one to buy. Now I see I need both, as well as Live at the Isle of Wight and maybe even the Royal Albert Hall. <br /> <br />My philosophy with other bands is just to have one DVD to see what they're like live. But The Kids Are Alright shows the evolution of the band - as only 60s bands seemed to evolve.Their early 60s music is quite different to late 60s, and their early 70s music is similarly quite different. Only the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Traffic and Pink Floyd evolved quite as much. <br /> <br />The film also clarified another thing for me - the praise heaped on John Entwhistle. You cannot appreciate his talent unless you see him play. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1400032717|3.0|I hated reading this book and hated the kid narrating the story.

B000063DIR|1.0|They took off the original bass and drum tracks, which couldn't have been improved, and re-recorded them twenty years later under totally different conditions, and ruined the whole album - which is a real shame because the original album was actually perfect.  This is just incredibly bad taste and proves that Ozzy is not an artist in any sense of the word.  Along with Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake handed Ozzy his solo career on a plate, and this is what they get in return.  That's gratitude for you.  Screw you, Ozzy, you suck.  You not only screwed over your band, you screwed your fans, too!  This isn't Diary of a Madman!

B000002G23|5.0|Just buy this excellent compilation and you will be happy you did - you also won't have to deal with the hassle of buying all the band's albums, because they're all here.  Stewart Copeland is the best drummer in rock music, with the possible exception(s) of John Bonham and/or Bill Bruford.  Andy Summers is a zen-master of rhythm, taste, and tone - his multi-layered guitar sounds are always interesting and come through beautifully - Sting sounds great on vocals and bass, although he would be better if he wasn't always trying to dominate (for example, hooping and hollering over Andy when he is playing something brilliant).

To be honest, I had never heard of him prior to purchasing the DVD, but the reviews I read were quite strong.  So, I took the chance & have no regrets!  I sincerely hope to see him live one day.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|Actually 3 1/2 stars .The Clash' third album London Calling is possibly the most overated album of all time . I understand if you're into punk you want a claim in rock and roll history , but most of the songs on this album are hardly punk . The bulk of the album is reggae or reggae influenced . The title song is great , Brand New Cadillac ( a cover of a Vince Taylor song ) is great too . Ditto for Lost In A Supermarket , a song that sounds like something from Genesis' Duke period . Spanish Bombs , Hateful and Clampdown are good too . There are 18 tracks on this album .What are the other standout songs ? I don't hear 'em . I would think that \\" one of the great albums of all time \\"  would be solid from top to bottom . The bulk of this album is mediocre pop/ reggae songs . Where's the edge ? I don't hear it . This is one of those albums like Exile On Main Street that's cool too like ... possibly because the critics  say so ?
068484267X|3.0|This is one book that I did not expect to enjoy at all. I don't usually like the genre, and the story didn't sound even a bit interesting. It didn't help that my mom, who had read it before me, called it \\"depressing and pathetic\\". But I had to read it for school, so...what can ya do? <br /> <br />I'll start by stating the bottom line: I DID enjoy it. I don't agree with the reviewers who called it boring. It was actually the kind of book that you could read a hundred or so pages every day and not really get tired of it. \\"Exciting\\" may be the wrong word, but I guess it was so easy to read and interesting enough that it drew me in. The prose is this certain style that I haven't found in any other book--conversational, not much punctuation, and lots of slang and run-on sentences. However, this isn't exactly a bad thing. In fact it's one of the things that made the story sort of \\"roll off the tongue\\", if you know what I mean.  <br /> <br />Besides boring, it seems a lot of one-and-two-star reviewers called Angela's Ashes depressing (one of them being my mom). This I can see, more than boring. However, I personally didn't find it depressing. Sad, yes, but not depressing. There was enough humor to keep it from being overly-sad. If I were to use one word to describe Angela's Ashes, it definately wouldn't be \\"funny.\\" But there were a few quirky things throughout that made me smile, or even laugh out loud.  <br /> <br />So some more positive things to say about this book... <br />~McCourt comes across as a likeable character, who you really \\"know\\" by the end of the story. And even in the scenes when he's, um, a little less likeable, there's still something in him that you can relate too. <br />~It paints a good picture of a childhood. Which, in the end, is what the author wanted to do. <br />~It's the first book that really-truly-genuinely made me think, \\"Wow. I've got it really good, ya know that?\\". This is the only book I've ever read that actually made me greatful for whatI have. Theoretically, I suppose, I've read a lot of books that SHOULD have made me feel this way. But I think a book really has to be GOOD to get through to you in this way. And the author cannot present his life, however tough it may be, in a manner that seems to beg for pity. Angela's Ashes fit these criteria. <br /> <br />Sounds good, right? But now I have to go into why I gave the book only three stars. <br /> <br />The first, and by far the most minor, of my complaints is that Angela, as a character, was never well developed, especially considering the book was named after her. She had one personality trait, which I guess you might say was \\"desperate\\".  <br /> <br />But the main reason I gave this book such a low rating is that it REALLY went downhill near the end. It started when he first told about how he had been \\"interfering with himself\\", to use the author's own words, and how it was a mortal sin, and oh God I'm gonna go to Hell, but I couldn't stop looking at the girls in their underwear in the magazines. First of all, to put it simply, it's just TOO MUCH INFORMATION. I do not WANT to know about you interfering with yourself, it's not a subject that I WANT to read about (as I'm sure you can imagine). Secondly, he goes into great detail. It's not that I haven't read \\"explicit\\" stuff before, but a couple of the R-rated scenes in this book I really think the author could've left out, without taking anything whatsoever from the quality of the story. I get that he's just telling it how it was, but there is something called good taste. And thirdly, content aside, it just became repetitive, like a few other things in this book (his father's drinking, for one). After a while, I found myself thinking, \\"Oh no, not again!\\" <br /> <br />But the real disappointment was the VERY last scene in the book, in which 19-year-old McCourt has a fling with a married woman at a party upon returning to America. I mean, what kind of way is that to end an otherwise fairly good book? The reason for putting this in, as the author implies, is that it shows how he no longer had to worry about it being a sin, and that he wouldn't have cared if \\"the pope himself\\" had seen him. As I read this, I was thinking \\"Well, maybe you SHOULD care!\\" And then you wonder what McCourt is trying to say, and what this says about him as a person, and it kind of puts a damper on the tone of the whole book, making you wonder if McCourt really IS such a likeable character(NOT a good thing to do in the last scene!) Even looking past the fact of WHAT exactly is portrayed in this scene, I think he should've ended with something redeeming or inspirational or even SAD, just to get some kind of emotion from readers (yes, emotion is good!). <br /> <br />Anyway, taking everything into consideration, I'd say this rounds off into a fairly average 3-star book. Worthy of the Pulitzer Prize? No. Worthy of your time? Yes. Just, by all means, don't expect it to be perfect.

B000BYA5G4|3.0|Director Andrew Niccol depicts the frivolous aggrandizement of a contemporary armaments merchant Yuri Orlov played by Nicolas Cage in \\"Lord of War\\".  Cage, a Ukrainian emigre leading a dead end existence in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach, decides to dabble in the business of dealing arms.  Within short order he establishes himself in this dangerous business allying himself with scores of heartless and murderous despots in the process.<br /><br />Cage, who manages to glean a fortune from his enterprises, successfully is able to buffer himself from the slaughter wrought by his products.  He is able to maintain a lavish lifestyle, wooing and marrying the woman of his affections model Ava played by the attractive Bridget Moynahan.  His younger brother Vitaly who is his partner played by Jared Leto, however soon succumbs to the pressure, falling into the abyss of cocaine addiction.<br /><br />Throughout the film Cage is monitored and chased by federal investigator Jack Valentine played by Ethan Hawke.  Hawke plays a role analogous to Inspector Javert to Cage's Jean Valjean in Les Miserables finally trapping his long pursued prey.<br /><br />The finale, however tries to, unsuccessfully in my view, affirm the justification for this allegedly indispensible endeavor.
B000G759LW|5.0|Her voice is normally enough to just make me happy, but this cd shows off those chords she has more than aything else.  The way she did a modern twist on jazz, and still kept the roots into what jazz is, is amazing.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I watched this film again in anticipation of Hanks in The DaVinci Code. And I was amazed at how much I reacted this movie after 2 years. Unlike others, I don't like to give away the film. Details can sometimes make it so the film doesn't need to be seen. I prefer to express the emotion in this movie.<br /><br />At the time this film was released, everyone compared it to Hanks performance in Forest Gump. And I did also. But now, after watching it again, I see the similarities and the differences.<br /><br />Gump was a series of vignettes. A `slower' person haphazardly thrown into historical situations. Castaway, in a quick capsulation, is the end of a man's life due to being stranded on an uncharted island after a plane crash, the loss of the love of his life, and in the final minutes, realizing he has a whole new life to begin. A life with more possibilties than his previous one.<br /><br />Chuck Noland of FedEx, unknowing leaves his life behind when he boards a a plane. The plane goes down and he survives on an island well out of the shipping lanes and travelled waters. The fact that he survives is a miracle. Hanks is superb in the transformation of personalities that surface. At first, he is the civilized clot who has no idea what to do. Then he realizes the hopelessness of his situation (punctuated by a panaramic view of his tiny island from a summit), and succumbs to this hopelessness of his situation with a suicide attempt. When the attempt fails, he accepts his doom as lost soul. Until he is able to create fire. And then, he assumes the role of a survivor. The key is a Volleyball (whom he dubs Wilson due to it's maker) marked by his own bloodly hand. This connection of blood, creates the alterego Hanks imprints upon Wilson. While it appears he is going insane, this is the key to his surviving, as well as his love for his fiance, played by Helen Hunt. His transformation from dweeb to survivor (the scenes with his impacted tooth are wrenching), are a parellel to real life, telling the viewer to never give up, no matter what the odds.<br /><br />It is the ending, after his rescue, that truly affected me. The realization of both he and Hunt, that their lives had moved on, was at the least, powerfully emotional.<br /><br />While this film recieved mixed reviews when it came out, it has to be viewed again. In today's atmosphere, with the horrors of the world, this movie is about the individual, and not the world.llel to real life, telling the viewer to never give up, no matter what the odds. <br /> <br />It is the ending, after his rescue, that truly affected me.

B000AADYYO|5.0|Aaah, those wacky Swedes! There is one hell of a lot of good musicianship coming out of Europe these days, and Opeth are becoming the leaders of this style of death metal, a style they pretty much started. Usually, when I describe something as \\"death metal\\", people tend to run screaming. To avoid confusion, most modern metal fans categorize a band as death metal primarily due to the use of guttural, growling vocals most people either love or hate-otherwise known as the \\"cookie monster\\" growl-mmmmmmmmmm COOOKIES!!! To avoid this band because of their vocal style would be to deprive you of a real eye-opener if you like well-written, intense music. Opeth set themselves apart from the beginning of their career with their superior musicianship(both guitarists are just sick talented) and their use of an alternating style in song composition. Opeth albums are typically explosions of heavily distorted metal guitars and barking vocals which are then (suddenly and unexpectedly, in many cases) juxtaposed with serene, classically-influenced clean-tone guitar meditations and harmonized clean, yearning vocal sections. Dark, brooding subject matter and lyrics and atmosphere draw these seemingly desparate elements into a seamless, hypnotic whole on this album.....I find moments of sheer beauty and nightmarish intensity both, and the production, artwork and sound quality is just superb....another hallmark of these very influential Swedes. One way I often hear people describe Opeth is that they are a sort of \\"metal Pink Floyd\\". I would describe them as \\"Pink Floyd meets Tool meets Robin Trower meets Camel meets Death meets Porcupine Tree meets Iron Maiden meets Black Sabbath on Opium.\\" Well done, indeed. One of the must-own metal releases of the last few years.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This anime/movie certainly has the right to follow the game of the same title. It has the action and character involvement with one another to make it great. For those that have not played the game, it still plays out without having to know the background, but it certainly can help. The only disappointment I had was there wasn't enough character involvement from the other \\"main\\" characters from the game, it heavily focused on Cloud and Tifa. Other than that, the graphics, storyline and everything else needed to make a good movie were awsome!

There is a good chance that when ALL of the Star Wars films are released on HD-DVD and/or Blu-Ray, it will be almost impossible to compress it to IPOD or PSP standards.  So take my advice, buy this DVD, download good DVD to IPOD/PSP software, compress the film, and put it on the player.  PLEASE don't share the compressed video via bittorrent/limewire/kazaa, you don't want the Feds to land you in Jail.  This guide is just for your own personal enjoyment that CAN NOT be shared online.

B00008OLYN|5.0|It amazes me how many people think that this album is Metal/Death/Black or Doom Metal. Sure, Opeth have some pretty heavy albums with one of the main styles as Death Metal, but that doesn't mean that EVERYTHING they put out can be classified as Death metal. A lot of reviewers are stating that this is a great \\"Death Metal\\" release. What!?!?!?! Damnation is Progressive Rock at most. There is NO METAL on this album at all. What Damnation has to offer is some of the most complex acoustic guitar work, amazing bluesy solos, amazing and complex drum work and deep groovy bass lines. The vocals are clean and beautiful, as are the lyrics. <br /> <br />Everyone is so quick to judge Opeth because they released an album that is not Death Metal. OPETH IS NOT DEATH METAL! They may have put out two albums that were strictly DEATH METAL at first, but they have evolved into something much more than that. It seems that people are having a hard time seeing that. <br />Not everyone is going to enjoy Opeth, they are not for everyone. Neither are Meshuggah, Tool, Staind, Anathema or Lamb of God for everyone either. Everyone has different tastes. Some people cannot stand Progressive Rock, and Damnation IS Progressive Rock made by multi-talented artists who happen to use Death Metal styles for most of their albums. <br />Opeth is not your typical band, they can pull off virtually any style and make it sound so amazing and beautiful, hard and terrorizing, soft and angelic. <br />Many will not understand Opeth because they don't make music to please the average listener or the radio loving person who desires to hear the same thing over and over again by the same old crusty bands.  <br />Opeth is all about evolution, trying something new, and expanding beyond labels and beyond what is accepted.
B000000NN1|4.0|This is a wonderful Vangelis album and is fairly energetic, with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged.  Released in 1975, Heaven and Hell incorporates a full choir into the Vangelis sound.<br /><br />Vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers, electric piano, acoustic piano, a full drum kit, and percussion.  Vangelis is joined by the English Chamber Choir (conducted by Guy Protheroe) with Vana Veroutis as the lead female vocal, in addition to Jon Anderson (vocals/lyrics on Heaven and Hell (Part 1 So Long Ago, So Clear).  Vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano. As a huge Yes fan, I was delighted to hear Jon's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics.  As far as the inclusion of the choir goes, I did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording.<br /><br />The Heaven and Hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including Part I (21'58\\") and Part II (21'16\\").  In general, the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by Vangelis.  Another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages.  Of course, my favorite part comes at the end of Part I, which is the 4'58\\" section with Jon on vocals.  This short \\"song\\" is quite moving and uplifting.  Movement II is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two.  The choir is featured on the second movement, along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented Vana Veroutis.  Part II closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section, which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good Vangelis album and is recommended along with Albedo 0.39 (1976); Spiral (1977); and the excellent Opera Sauvage (1979).
B00005JKLZ|4.0|This is an excellent remake. The CGI effects are very neat, and all the actors are more than capable- Guy Pearce and Jeremey Irons especially. I think that anyone who enjoys very dynamic and unique movies (Starship Troopers, LOTR trilogy, V for Vendetta, etc.) would enjoy this as well. It is a simple movie, as far as concept and plotline goes, but its well made and the central motivation for the main character to build a time machine is quite sufficient and easy for the audience to grasp and even sympathize with. This is a perfect example of good science fiction, heady and creative. Bottom Line: Not oscar- winning or genius cinema, but immensley entertaining and a treat to watch.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Clearly, this movie is a true forerunner to the Star Trek universe.  That is not to say, this is only for fans.  This is a well made, thoughtful movie with really good special effects.  The cast is great to watch.  Leslie Nielsen, Jack Kelly and Anne Francis play the material very well.  Look for the debut of Robby the Robot.  This is one of the best of this genre and of its day.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I initially hesitated to purchase this based on editorials I had read......but, it was a big mistake to cheat myself for the couple of months that I did.  I am so impressed by this CD.  I love acoustic guitar and maybe his voice is considered \\"a little tired\\" but, the powerful man and voice is still there.  It may bring a tear to your eye......do yourself a favor and listen to this awesome collection.
B00005JO1R|5.0|Walk the Line was an excellent movie.  With the balance of entertaining shows of Joquin Phoenix's excellent singing and the drama of his life, the movie moves at a constantly gratifying pace.   <br /> <br />Phoenix's impression of Johnny Cash is an excellent one.  Although he is missing some key elements in Cash's speech (for example why is pronounced with the \\"wh\\" sound in \\"who\\"), the energy and soul behind his singing and acting is undeniably close to Cash's own personality. <br /> <br />With Johnny and June Carter Cash choosing the actors for their own respective roles, the movie comes as close as the real thing as possible, especially for those who are too young to have known Johnny Cash.  The movie certainly brought new interest in his music, and only serves as further proof that he is legend and that his music will always be popular, transcending the limitations of genre and era. <br /> <br />This being a Collector's Edition, I feel that the value is in the outstanding box and artwork.  At the time of purchase, it was available for $20.86 compared to the regular Widescreen version for $19.99.  What an excellent value! For only 87 cents more, you get a great box and cover and a second disc!   <br /> <br />However, I was sad not to see more performances by Phoenix on the DVD.  It would have been nice to include more than what was on the second disc, though these are more wishes than complaints. <br /> <br />Overall, if you are going to get Walk the Line, skip tomrrow's coffee or leave the cheese out of your sub and get the Collector's Edition, you'll be glad you did!
B00003CWPL|3.0|I'm a little behind the times, never having seen this, the first of David Lynch's films. But having viewed it only last night, it's still too early for me to tell whether \\"Eraserhead\\" is a weird batch of disconnected and meaningless nonsense, or something more.<br /><br />For now, I'll settle for faint praise by calling it...interesting.<br /><br />I'll say this: the film does not lack for fascinating visuals. Henry, the film's protagonist, sports a bushy, foot-high coif that becomes a signature of the film. Another classic image is of a stiff-limbed Henry waiting patiently a good 30 seconds for elevator doors to close. Then there's the bizarre babbling of Mrs. X (the mother of Henry's paramour, Mary) and the odd alien baby that Henry and Mary seemingly produce. The goo-spouting tiny chickens offered for dinner by Mr. X certainly keep your attention, as does the gorgeous neighbor across the hall that Henry lusts after. And let's not forget the dream sequence in which matter from Henry's head is used to manufacture pencil erasers. Phew!<br /><br />\\"Eraserhead\\" is vintage Lynch. There are dreams within fantasies within bizarre real-life. There are inexplicable elements -- black planets and a little wormy thing that Henry puts into his cupboard -- that defy analysis. There's the bizarre, as with the \\"Girl in the Radiator,\\" the puffy-jowled young dancer who minces across a small stage while wormy aliens fall from above.<br /><br />The film as transferred to DVD is extremely well produced. The lighting captures the grime and rundown appearance of Henry's flat. The industrial sound effects, while relentless, are perfect. There seems to be not a stray spot on the image nor any stray blip in the soundtrack...which makes you suspect that a director who exerts such loving care on production values *must* be communicating something of worth.<br /><br />The DVD extras are mostly comprised of a 90-minute long interview with Lynch, looking back 30 years to the shooting of Eraserhead. Interspersed with old video and photos from the 6-year shoot, Lynch's monologue is rambling and halting and occasionally illuminating. Most instructively, he claims that no one in the quarter century since the film's release has interpreted the film the way he did. Don't expect Lynch to spill the beans on his idea of the film's meaning. But for those who find the film hard to understand, don't worry. You're evidently in good company.<br /><br />I have no idea how to rate the film. 3 stars seems right, awarded for excellent production values and fantastic imagery.otos from the 6-year shoot, Lynch's monologue is rambling and halting and occasionally illuminating.

0345440900|5.0|I am very surprised at the spotlight reviewers who had trouble with this book.  As a mom of a 3yr old, a 2yr old, a 1yr old, and one more on the way, I have to say that Tracy Hogg's book is the best one on newborns in my library.  It is a refreshing middle-of-the-road read, somewhere between the 1920s way of authority-centered parenting and the 2000s way of child-centered or attachment parenting.  She really recommends a balance between both--VERY difficult to find in a normal American baby book these days--where both mom and baby have their unique needs met at this tender time.<br /><br />Specifically, Hogg recommends not letting your baby cry it out or go hungry, but not to assume that all cries mean hunger.  From experience, you soon find out that nursing or sticking a bottle in a crying infant's mouth works well only for mall trips and doctor's offices.  There is much more to raising a baby and beginning a relationship than feeding.<br /><br />Hogg does NOT give breastfeeding the short thrift--she simply focuses on trying to lift the guilt burden which is placed on most American mothers these days.  Her book is not a lactation consultant lesson.<br /><br />Hogg also gives great advice on how to get your baby to nap and sleep at night, again taking the middle-of-the-road approach between not letting a child cry it out but not accepting it as normal either (and rearranging your life permanently in order to pacify your baby-toddler-preschooler through the night).  After four straight years of baby-raising, and talking with many many mothers on the subject, I can say that any parent who does not welcome this straight-forward type of advice if they are having trouble in this area--any mother who considers helping their child nap and sleep well in their crib to be \\"cruel\\" or \\"demanding\\"--is way off target.  No psychological damage will be done if Hogg's advice is followed... in fact, some sanity may be reclaimed!<br /><br />Her input on baby personality types is great.  Helpful, if not perfect, especially in retrospect.<br /><br />And yet the one thing I agree that could have been addressed better is the discussion of the earliest newborn days.  After nursing three tiny ones of my own and adopting a more parent-centered approach to their young years, I still find that the first week or two of having a new infant is up for grabs.  There should be no pressure to begin a routine until mom feels capable and perceives the baby to be ready.  Obviously one can be started, but I think it is worth strongly mentioning in a newborn book that some parents find the transition to bringing their little one to be very difficult--for any number of reasons, including just normal recovery.  And the implementation (or not) of a routine does not affect the baby much in those first days.<br /><br />Overall, however, I find Hogg's book to be so much more encouraging than Sears, Ezzo, or even the AAP's book on the first year.  She's upbeat and experienced, and so common sensical that it is difficult to believe that there have been so many complaints on this site.  Read it with relief.s is great.

0060930349|5.0|While I wouldn't recommend that my students read only Paul Johnson's work on US History, I would definitely recommend that they read it in accompaniment to their texts.  Johnson is rightly to be credited for providing a more balanced and optimistic view of the American people/government than is prevalent in the majority of publishing firms today.  He does not shy away from criticism where it is due, but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due--even if it means offending some politically correct ears.<br /><br />While I agree that he can be classified as a conservative, I would also note that this is not a \\"conservative's conservative\\" book.  By that I mean that people who are unabashedly Republican,  Religious Right, etc., will not find unscrutinized support for their revisionist accounts of history.  While Johnson does overlap with certain conservative appraisals of historical events and figures, he does so on a case-by-case basis, always aiming to support his evaluations with fact.  In many instances, these facts are not widely known because they have been cut out from liberal textbooks.  They are not, however, smelling of the party line.<br /><br />Indeed, Johnson's book is fascinating for his historical scholarship, research, and deep analysis.  His coverage of \\"forgotten\\" spans of time (i.e. Grant, Arthur, Hayes, Garfield) is welcome, as is his deft treatment of figures who are normally expansive in coverage (i.e. Lincoln, JFK).  I found the 1860-1900 chapters to be personally most enlightening.<br /><br />Johnson is especially great at noticing overarching themes in government and economic life.  He is not a social or sociological commentator, which will relieve some of his more liberal readers.  And in fact, I believe most people--liberal or conservatve--would gain an awful lot from his research and presentation if they read with an open mind.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Once in a while an album comes along that speaks to you and just makes so much sense. It becomes a soundtrack to that moment in time and causes you to reflect on your life and memories that are important to you. Plans is a masterwork for DCFC. Each track weaves a beautiful web, touching on the themes of life, love and death. After the delicate Transatlanticism and the richer and rewarding Plans one can only anticipate where this very talented band is heading in the future.
0224076051|5.0|Reading the so pretending harvard professor \\"review\\" made me drop a few lines. My personal feeling is that all reviewers including book's author are wrong. String theory is not wrong. Any formal mathematical construct that can be proved is correct. Does it serve any practical purpose because of that? Not necessarily. Same with string theory, it describes what the laws of physics would be if the world just happened to function as string constructs specify. Does it? To the latest evidence it does not, but if there existed somewhere a world formed by tiny strings, perhaps string theory would describe it much better than any other.

One of the speakers kept getting static in it. And I had to keep adjusting them, not very good for working out. If you like that they are a in ear type style may I suggest spending a little more and going with the Creative Headphones EP-630. I used to like these Sony's a lot until I tryed the Creative ones, they are incredable. The bass is out of the world, and you don't have to adjust them even once and they are really comfortable. If you go for the Creative Headphones EP-630 you won't be dissapointed. If you like the in ear style, if you don't the Creative's are not for you.
B000002J0B|4.0|I ask this as the heavy side of Zeppelin is not here. Whatever the heavy side of Zeppelin had to say on ZOSO is no longer here. This does still have rock in it's bones, but it's not \\"Hammer Of The Gods\\" anymore. \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is very good starter, but perhaps if they put \\"No Quarter\\" after it instead of \\"The Rain Song\\" it may have been more impressive. \\"The Ocean\\" is perfect where it is as a hum along song for when you're on the way home, and so is \\"Over The Hills and Far Away\\", and if you want to get creative put the Barking Dogs\\" Jingle Bells\\" before it as this was how I got introduced to \\"Over The Hills\\". \\"Dancing Days\\" I tried to like it in my heart, but to be honest I can't do it anymore. It's a depressing dance tune, and it just eats away at my insides to where it's pricked them to I just cry and cry, so I will have to be honest, and say it's one of the worst songs from Zeppelin. \\"Dyer Maker\\" sounds something Satanic to me, but it's actually soothing to listen to. In some ways the Monster was neutered, but depending on whether you follow the glass being half empty, or half full will determine whether this is one of your favorite Zeppelin albums, or not.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I found the theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven to be very disappointing. How could Ridley Scott, one of our great story tellers, leave holes and inconsistencies in his movie? <br />As all reviewers seem to agree on, the director's cut simply answers each question or criticism you had about the original release. <br />Orlando Bloom's character which felt completely fake and 2-dimensional (the little blacksmith who suddenly becomes a knight and an army general, falling for the king's sister somewhere during his journey. How credible was all that?  <br />The director's cut demonstrates the importance of good editing. The theatrical cut simply missed all the important exposition and development scenes! As incredible as it sounds, they managed to dry out the main character and the whole meaning of the movie. <br />You litteraly have not seen Kingdom of Heaven if you have not seen this director's cut. <br /> <br />Regarding the representation of religion in the script, I believe the movie is quite fair. Both sides, Muslims and Catholics, are depicted with equal attention and understanding. <br />There is clearly a lot of politics at work between the two leaders. I never thought the story was being hypocritical or revisionist. <br />The only thing one could argue is that Ibelin's view of god and catholicism a litte modern for a crusader. I mean, those guys took on a journey through Europe to fight for Jerusalem. How could they lose their faith so easily? This said, Ibelin's speech totally fits in the movie as you can understand he has doubts about his faith and god in general when he sees that the holy city has triggered such bloodshed. <br /> <br />I find Ridley Scott's cut to be a true masterpiece of epic films. <br />And please stop trying to compare this to Lord of the Rings. Please, please, please! History existed BEFORE Tolkien! And Ridley Scott was already a great director before Peter Jackson even released Bad Taste! <br />And even though Orlando Bloom may have been cast due to his appeal on younger viewers, it does not mean that Scott has been serving a cold plate: Kingdom now ranks among the greatest inspiring historical epics like Braveheart, Dances with Wolves, Gladiator,... <br /> <br />Just a note on the bonus discs: contrary to the movie itself, you could compare them to the supplemental material of the Lord of the Rings box set, which is not the lesser compliment. Every step of the movie-making is shown and discussed in great details. <br /> <br />This is a MUST-HAVE in all good DVD collection.

0345457684|5.0|Let me tell you a story before I tell you about the book.  There once lived a man with little direction in life, still little direction.  A man who cared not for the pleasures of reading, though he should.  A man who never read a single book in college, even though he was an English major.  He simple assumed sparknotes and group discussions would suffice to understand these tales.  Then he came across a desciption of Altered Carbon while suffering Amazon.  He has yet to put down any book.  This person was me.<br /><br />This book is the future of scifi writing.  With it's hard-edged protagonist, Tekashi Kovacs, this novel is the pulp of the next few generations.  Where the future is not the progressive ideals of a fantasy land, but a corrupt dysotopia of today with the incorporation of advanced technology.  The sheer understandability of the main character is what I enjoy so much, plus the cyber-punk ethics is what gives this novel five stars.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is the first season of a show that takes its place along side the great family dramas like \\"Family\\", but also holds its own as a teen drama in the vein of \\"Dawson's Creek.\\" The first season establishes Andy and Ephram's father-son relationship as the emotional core of the show.  It also introduces what will be the main romantic arc of the show; the courtship dance between Ephram and Amy Abbott. Supporting characters do precisely that; they support the SHOW and not just serve as window dressing for the main characters. All characters feels like they natuarlly belong in this story and that the story would be incomplete without them. The show only got better in later seasons.  Unfortunately, this DVD collection has not sold well enough to convince the money-men that releasing later seasons will be profitable. For those who know and love the show (the two are mutually inclusive), you need to purchase this DVD set to encourage the powers-that-be to release all seasons. For those who have not seen the show, get this set and see at least part of what you missed.
B00005JOWR|5.0|Let me be upfront, I loved this film!  It's original, quirky and funny.  An unusual mix in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />The essence of the film is the story of Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart.  He is a lobbyist for big tobacco.  Typically, such a person is to be reviled.  We all know that smoking is not good for your health.  So, how can anyone defend the indefensible?  Well, Nick does it with humour and he does a good job of it.  Nick is a man of great charisma notwithstanding the fact that his bosses are deemed by many to be the devil incarnate.<br /><br />If this film has a message it is that tolerance still has a place in our society.  All too often, individuals and groups think it is there right to impose their values on others.  Think not just tobacco, but anti-alcohol lobbyists, Christian vigilantes and environmentalists.  The list is almost endless.  These people think they know what is good for you even if you apparently don't.  To question these zealots is to leave oneself open to attack.  Only they know what is good for you and society.  There opinion matters.  Your opinion is of no value.<br /><br />\\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is not an excuse for smoking.  Rather it is a black comedy about those who strive to make decisions for you.  The plot is quick paced and the acting is wonderful.  Eckhart is supported by Maria Bello as a liquor industry lobbyist and David Koechner as spokesman for the firearms industry.  Together they are \\"merchants of death\\".  They are also a very clever trio that works well as a unit.<br /><br />I'm sure the self-righteous amongst us will condemn this film.  Too bad!  Life entails risks that we can determine for ourselves.  This film is a breath of fresh air!

B0006ZE7G2|4.0|Staying over at my house in high school almost always meant The Wall would make its way to the VCR. Not only because it was a great movie, but also because it had been stolen from every video store in town. By the time I was out of high school, the tape was literally worn out, and the weekly viewings had ceased.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I missed the first release, but I picked up the 25th Anniversary version the week it came out, and it brought back tons of memories.<br /><br />I'm not sure about some of the reviews here, as some claim that the transfer and audio aren't improved, and others claim it has been. While I can't comment on the differences between DVD's, I can say that the transfer was about what I expected, but the extras on the disc were a very nice surprise.<br /><br />That all said, I think the video transfer could have been improved. Obviously, the picture quality was better than VHS, but it was still rather grainy and dull. Though purists may disagree, I think a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" should show a little more work.
1401302378|5.0|I read TLT from the perspective of a 20 year veteran in manufacuturing and supply chain. This book resonates with my own personal experience. Very few of the factories I work with are generating the majority of their sales from a few top selling products. Just as Chris Anderson argues, my experience with manufacturing and supply chain is that we are producing a more diverse mix of product lines and configurations than 5 or 10 years ago. <br /> <br />My favorite section of TLT is the background discussion about why the culture in general is becoming more choice driven - comparing the mass market conformity of the 50s to today's trend where being different has evolved to a personal value. <br /> <br />Given the media/entertainment focus, Anderson doesn't discuss manufacturing implications of the Long Tail. For example, does the Long Tail drive more or less oustourcing in America? Are economies of scale suffering? Can Big Companies adapt? etc. Lastly, I would have liked examples and discussion of any trends that are not going \\"long tail\\" <br /> <br />But this is a great book

0861714911|5.0|It seems there are many books telling us how the Budda would date, eat, work...etc. These books may be helpful, but why not get as close to the original sources as possible? Unfortunately the Suttas (or sutras...the collected rememberances of the Buddas talks) can be overwhelming for many of us because of their vast number, the repetitive language, the obscure references, and they are not anthologized in a helpful way. In this  book you have exerpts of the most foundational suttas. They are presented in chapters related by topic and each chapter has a wonderful introduction. The structure is oriented towards practice -  ethical training, meditation, and wisdom. If you are looking for a book that is beyond a basic introduction and can be a touchstone for your own development - this could be a book you could work with for years to come. I can't recommend it highly enough
B0000931QA|5.0|While this is a relatively old album, it really is the benchmark which Queenryche and other bands are measured.  As an \\"old school\\" ryche fan, I got bought a few live CDs thinking that I would get a great dose of 5.1 ryche pleasure.    Wow!  Was I in for a surprise.  Queensryche will forever struggle with being compared to this CD.  Although it is subjective, the other CDs aren't 20% as woven together, melodic, and powerful as this one.    Some people look at fine wine as a living thing that gets better to a point and then starts to decay.  The same is true for Queensryche.  This was it.  If you haven't bought this album, I implore you to do it.  While there have been concept albums before from Tommy to Mr. Roboto, this is a masterpiece.    I know Mindcrime II is out, but it too wants in comparison to the original.  I would recommend buying this CD and the Livecrime DVD in 5.1.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan, always fascinatingly elusive, threw his fans another curveball by recently releasing two highly acclaimed albums in a row. Both 1997's \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and this album had critics collectively hailing that \\"the guy still has it!\\" And this long after the age that many rock stars sputter into embarrassing self parody. The eponymous Dylan, 60 years old at the time of this release, appears to have harbored no delusions or illusions of granduer. Not that anyone could blame him if he did. Over the last 40 years many have foisted titles such as \\"genius\\", \\"God\\", \\"messiah\\", \\"saviour\\", and \\"the voice of his generation\\" upon him against his wishes. Dylan never seemed to believe the hyperboles. Sometime in the 1960s he elicited horror from fans by simply walking out of \\"the scene\\".<br /><br />Many thought he was through, and many kept thinking that year after year, decade after decade. He didn't go away. He still hasn't. Even though he admitted in a Minnesota Public Radio interview that he thinks about giving up \\"every day\\", somehow he trudges on. He survived going electric, drug use, having his neck broken, an infamous \\"Christian phase\\", professional malaise, a smattering of uninspired releases, a cigarette drenched raspy voice, a potentially fatal heart condition, entertaining Pope John Paul II, and a lifelong hounding from the media and fans. After all that, the humor that pervades this 2001 release comes as a shock. And he's still going.<br /><br />\\"Love And Theft\\" traipses all over the American musical landscape. The styles range from hard rock, blues, swing, mellow crooning, and banjo-soaked western. \\"Tweedle Dum & Tweedle Dee\\" opens the album with a dramatic fade-in. Are those two surreal characters politicians, businessmen, hypocritical religious types? Dylan growls that \\"Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man / Tweedle-dee Dum, he'll stab you where you stand\\". \\"Mississippi\\", a Dylan classic, gets sung from the perspective of an outsider who is \\"Feeling like a stranger that nobody sees.\\" Apparently this person has walked into a precarious situation and bemoans that he has \\"Stayed in Mississippi a day too long\\". Words of alienation weave in and out of the lovely melody. And on the line \\"thoughts so sublime\\" Dylan sardonically inflects his voice (self-referential?). This song will doubtless remain among Dylan's best. The album then takes a jolting upbeat turn with \\"Summer Days\\". Full frontal swing kicks in and Dylan and his band pull it off with surprising gusto. The lyrics refer to a \\"worn out star\\" who claims that \\"I know a place where there's still something goin' on\\". \\"Bye and Bye\\" introduces the crooning phase before the hard edged \\"Lonesome Day Blues\\" kicks in. Then the askew violins introduce the bouncy \\"Floater\\" and the hilarious line \\"I'm in love with my second cousin\\". \\"High Water\\" (dedicated to the alleged \\"King of the Delta Blues\\") brings a rolling banjo into the mix (as well as a bizarre request to \\"throw your panties overboard\\"). Some of the themes that Dylan explored on \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" get reexamined here but with some speckles of dry humor. The remainder of the album alternates between crooning and blues rock until the ominous chords of \\"Sugar Baby\\" chime. This song's chorus, \\"Sugar Baby get on down the road / You ain't got no brains, no how / You went years without me / Might as well keep going now\\" continues to resonate and haunt well after the album ends. Dylan had previously reinvented himself album to album or phase to phase, but here he appears to reinvent himself song by song. He takes on a cornucopia of styles and personas in a mere twelve song cycle. And he realy sounds like he's enjoying himself for the first time in years (maybe even since the \\"Boo Wilbury\\" days).<br /><br />\\"Love And Theft\\", Dylan's 37th album depending on how one counts, was released, on, of all days, September 11th, 2001, to enthusiastic critical acclaim. Though we now know that it won't be his last album, it nonetheless showcases his inexorable staying power. Following up the mighty \\"Time Out of Mind\\" wasn't an easy task, but somehow he pulled it off. And he managed to have some fun along the way. Having helped define the twentieth century, \\"Love And Theft\\" brings Dylan officially into the twenty-first. Only one thing remains certain: Dylan will keep going until he no longer can.inexorable staying power.

B000G759LW|3.0|Over all, I think this album is a good album, her voice is What carries this album through. Dis one to me is the better of the two dis. I guess because of a more up tempo vibe. And as follows are the songs that high light the album as a whole for me. \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" \\"Back In The Day\\" \\"On Our Way\\" \\"Understand\\" \\"Here To Stay\\" \\"Still Dirrty\\". They are only two songs on dis two that try to keep dis two aflot and they are \\"Candyman and \\"The Right Man. The second dis for me, for the most part is depressing. Now,to me there were some tracks  that needed to stay on the previous album stripped I mean that was then, this is now you made your point now let's move on. Like with the song \\"Without You\\" and even with the song \\"Still Dirrty\\".  But,to me her most impotant song is \\"Oh Mother\\" because it address domestic violence. And I know that MS. Aguilera though her music she has helped many and will continue to do so through her gift of song.
B00005JP7M|3.0|Woody Allen's overwhelmingly lackluster output over the past ten years has caused even his cultish fan base to have low expectations for each new release. Of course part of the problem is that many consider Allen as America's \\"greatest living director\\". Not only that, his films still attract \\"intellectuals\\" (quasi or not), so they typically receive far more scrutiny than the typical Hollywood or independent release du jour. But \\"Scoop\\" has more holes and continuity problems than many contemporary popular films, and the \\"Woody Allen as artist\\" syndrome will have long time viewers waggling their tongues in disgust.<br /><br />Though \\"Scoop\\" doesn't stand up to Allen's best work, it doesn't belong in the dung heap with his absolute worst, either (as some critics have categorized it). Compared to some of his recent comedies, Allen manages many laughable one-liners. Some fall embarrassingly flat of course, but the funny to appalling ratio is greatly reduced from such underwhelming comedies as \\"Curse of the Jade Scorpion\\" or \\"Small Time Crooks\\".<br /><br />\\"Scoop\\" also echoes many of Allen's previous films. Obvious parallels to 1993's \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery\\" will slap anyone, even snoozers, in the face after the first fifteen minutes. But it doesn't stop there. At the very beginning of the film, when the group of reporters eulogizes the merits of the recently deceased Joe Strombel, shadows of \\"Broadway Danny Rose\\" creep in. When Allen, as the \\"Great Sandini\\", begins his magic act, images of \\"Oedipus Wrecks\\" materialize. But this isn't the film's most nagging problem. The characters themselves provide that.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson's character, Sondra Pransky, a dental hygenist turned journalist, runs the historical gamut of Allen histrionics. After sleeping with her interview subject, she exudes the classic neurotic Woody Allen character. She gesticulates wildly and inflects her voice in an all too familiar manner (a la Kenneth Branagh in \\"Celebrity\\"). Then, following her disingenuous crush at breakneck speed on the aristocratic Peter Lyman, she takes on the persona of a bumbling Annie Hall or Alice (an exhumation of the Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow years). Her character remains so inconsistent that when she finally reveals her true identity to Lyman the audience may not even recognize her. Regardless, Johansson still manages to pull off some hilarious lines.<br /><br />The late Joe Strombel fulfills the classic deus ex machina role. Without his paranormal materializations the movie would have no foundation. For some reason he \\"channels\\" the inexperienced Pransky and delivers her his last big \\"scoop\\" during the Great Sandini's magic act. But soon he appears everywhere, but only to Pransky and Sandini exclusively. This doesn't work. If he can appear to the waif Sandini, why doesn't he appear to a Pulitzer prize willing journalist and just get it done with? This remains one of the film's most gaping holes.<br /><br />And then the issues of motivation. What motivation does Sandini have to follow Pransky in her flights of intuition? And what motivation does the upper class out-of-sight Lyman have for so fervently pursuing the socially ragged Pranksy (unconvincingly disguised as Jade Spence)? He says that he can't get the image of Pransky in her swimsuit out of his mind. Ok, understandable, but would that realistically lead to a passionate romance between untouchable social classes? Sounds more like a passionate bit of nookie. And, finally, why does Lyman feel the need to murder Pransky? Why would he even feel threatened by the machinations of her and Sandini? He's a well known upper class figure. Why would he even bother? They didn't have a bulletproof case against him until he blundered on the private lake. Lyman's motivation also seems implausible.<br /><br />The list of problems could continue...<br /><br />But now the big shocker. Regardless of the blatant gaffes inherent in its characterizations and plot, \\"Scoop\\" somehow manages to be a mildly entertaining film on first view. It will not change viewer's lives, nor will it evoke the aura of Allen's best work, but it does provide more than a few laughs and some beautiful cinematography. The movie moves along at a pace that may initially defy analysis of the plot. But a second viewing would likely produce pain. And even though the film nearly melts away upon closer scrutinty, at least it doesn't leave viewers with absolutely nothing.will not change viewer's lives, nor will it evoke the aura of Allen's best work, but it does provide more than a few laughs and some beautiful cinematography.

0393035158|5.0|<br />The result of religious beliefs, both fundamental and moderate, is clearly demonstrated yet again by the recent events in Lebanon (August 2006).  Books like this (another is \\"Crimes Against Logic\\" by Jamie Whyte) can only help to hasten the release from concepts that have cast their impenetrable shadow across the human race from the beginning.  In a world suffocating in credulous thought, this book provides a gasp of fresh air.  Now we just need to encourage the ascendancy of such ideas in the education system and broader world community in a belated effort to rid ourselves of the greatest of hinderances.  Alas, our leaders are the prime offenders.... <br /> <br />This book, in providing a clear explanation of the problem in a current context, provides some hope that we may eventually overcome the burden that is religious dogma.  The crack of light at the end of a dark hallway on the cover of my copy could not be more appropriate.
B000F4PD7G|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. This is--in its way--nothing more than an exploitation flick. The main female character is there for no reason other than to be raped and used by the male characters. Due to amazon's policy, I can't \\"spoil\\" the end of the film by giving away what happens, but rest assured, it only gets worse from there. The writers of this movie created an entire character whose only function is to be abused. If you want a great medieval epic, look elsewhere. If you want a good movie, look elsewhere. If you want to find out more about Beowulf or Anglo-Saxon England, look elsewhere.
B00009NHC5|4.0|Watching Alan Arkin play the curmudgeonly grandfather in this year's \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\", one tends to forget what an exciting and versatile actor he was back in the mid-1960's. Here he has a field day playing Harry Roat, a coolly intelligent psycho intent on taking a doll filled with heroin from a blind woman, whose husband inadvertently left it in their apartment. This sharply effective 1967 thriller was the last movie Audrey Hepburn made before her nearly decade-long, self-imposed retirement. She ended fifteen years of transcendent performances with her superb portrayal of Susy Hendrix, a photographer's recently blinded wife just getting used to living with her new limitations. Her gradual evolution from seemingly helpless to surprisingly resourceful is what grounds the terror-ridden film in humanity.<br /><br />The plot begins at the airport where a mysterious young woman asks Susy's unsuspecting husband Sam to keep the doll for her. He takes it back to their Greenwich Village basement apartment where the rest of the vice-gripping plot  takes place. Sam leaves Susy alone, and three men insinuate themselves into the place, one posing as Sam's old college friend to gain her trust. Roat plays three different people in his sadistic attempt to get Susy to hand over the doll. You can take it from there, but it does lead to a corking, no-holds-barred finale between Roat and Susy brilliantly executed. Without mentioning any particulars, the heart-stopping lunge (described colorfully in the DVD featurette) is a memorable piece of fright cinema.<br /><br />Credit needs to go to director Terence Young who sets the wheels of the rope-tightening plot with precision, and the economic screenplay by Robert and Jane Howard-Carrington based on the Frederick Knott play. Granted there are some contrived elements but you can figure them out yourself. There are solid contributions from Richard Crenna and Jack Weston as Roat's cohorts, Julie Herrod as the petulant teenaged neighbor and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as Sam. Henry Mancini composed the cocktail lounge-style 1960's title song, but he also wrote the tense, strings-squealing music score. The 2003 DVD contains one worthwhile extra, an eight-minute, looking-back featurette containing interviews with Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer (just ending his marriage to Hepburn at the time of filming). There are also two theatrical trailers, the original and a cheesier one where the audience is told the lights will be completely darkened for the film's last eight minutes.alist, Jr. as Sam.

B000AARKW6|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie. I'll put it up there with the Godfather because the story is that deep. Everybody loves Scareface, but in my opinion this is the better movie. Scareface, although a great movie (and personal favorite) goes way over the top but Carlito's Way stays in the steet. In fact, when Carlito says the streets are watching you can almost see the eyes in the background. The story, the actors, and the script all work well together. This movie is the real deal and worth spending the money to find it.
0743246616|1.0|I bought this book, like other reviewers, curious about the amazing sounding cupcakes made famous by TV appearances and word of mouth.<br /><br />  BUT- I've since made three recipes from this book that have been wildly dissapointing.  The famous cupcakes, even though I followed the recipe exactly and consider myself an fairly experienced baker, were heavy and mouthy.  I served them at a birthday and everyone was just suffering through them.<br /><br />  I tried again with another cupcake recipe last night-- the result was okay when they were warm and then dried up, resulting in dry, grainy revolting cakes.  I told a friend about this, and he said, well of course they don't want to really share the famous recipe for cupcakes.  So sad, but so true with this book.<br /><br />  I agree with the professional baker review that this book is dissapointing.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|First, the good news. This is a pretty exciting story and a pretty will made movie. <br /> <br />Now the bad news: It is a dangerous piece of political propaganda. <br /> <br />One of the themes of this movie is that lies are told to reveal the truth. And so it is with this movie although the revealed truths are not those \\"truths\\" that the movie makers intended. <br /> <br />The nutjob left loves this movie. DU and other moonbat websites have threads in which they are trying to incite mass demonstrations of protesters with Guy Fawkes masks. Indeed, Fawkes masks are beginning to show up at srewball protests. The reason this movie has struck such a chord is frightening. <br /> <br />This movie is a celebration of blind, mindless hatred for the purpose of inciting blind, mindless hatred and ensuing destruction. The movie makers would disagree with my analysis and would mostly likely says that the main theme of the movie is that a government that rules by manipulating terror must be destroyed by terror. <br /> <br />Although set in the UK, the government is clearly modeled after the Chimpy W. McHitler administration. For example, the bad guy soldiers are wearing American helmets and uniforms. Be that as it may, unless you already believe that W either caused or knowingly allowed terror against American citizens for the purpose of achieving and retaining power, there is nothing in this movie to convince you. You are to take it as a matter of a faith that W was behind 9/11 and that such tactics are the essence of the vision of his administration. And thus terror is justified when used against the government. <br /> <br />None of this, however, is explained or attempted to be explained in any intellectual way. Rather, your hatred is to be your guide. Just as you are to condemn the government without benefit of any evidence, you are to accept terror as a tactic without benefit of any plan. The plan is to blow up Parliament* which will automatically cause the government to fall for no apparent reason. The purposes are mindless hatred and destruction. <br /> <br />The movie ends with Fawkes' dream enacted, Parliament destroyed, and the government leaders murdered. No thought is given as to what comes next. To do so would raise all sorts of difficult problems. If a new government were to be created, there would have to be some thought given to what form of government that would be. It couldn't be a democratic government because, after all, that is the form of government that brought Chimpy to power in the first place. But if not democratic, then what? Better you don't ask. Our hero and heroine achieve orgasmic joy in accomplishing Fawkes' dream of mindless hatred and destruction and that is all you need to know. One cannot help but be reminded of the Democrat Party's campaign once again in 2006 that is again, as in 2002 and 2004, that we-are-not-Bush and otherwise devoid of any idea or solution. Mere hatred is enough. <br /> <br />The setting of this movie includes a deeply censored culture in which the slightest criticism of the government is cause for execution. (Indeed, possession of a Koran is grounds for execution, indicating that it is Christianity that uses terror on Islam rather than vice versa). Yet the mere fact that this movie was made and distributed disproves its very point, that we live in a fascist state. But here again, the idea is subjugate thought to hatred. Just kill and destroy and you will feel better. <br /> <br />This is a dangerous movie. Although any mentally healthy adult can watch it without being led into a life (or death) of terrorism, the emotionally unstable may well be incited to violence by the paranoid vision of this movie. And as not only the plethora of suicide bombers in the Middle East but also a glance at Democratic Underground reveal, there is no shortage of the emotional unstable. And, indeed, this movie is intended to incite the excitable. But we do live a free country so view away. Just keep your eyes open about what this movie is preaching. <br /> <br />One final irony is that this is a pretty good, exciting action picture. If it just didn't try so hard to convince you that this is contemporary or near future America, this would be a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />* One of the ironies of this deeply anti-religious movie is that it misconstrues or ignores the essence of the Gunpowder Plot that is used as a model. Fawkes was a deeply religious, one might say militant, Catholic whose was attempting to instill Catholicism over the objection (and bodies) of King James I and the members of Parliament. In the movie, the motive is to remove the influence (malevolent of course) of religion, not to instill it. But no never mind. Guy Fawkes is the inspiring secular saint because he wanted to kill and to destroy and that it what is important, to kill and to destroy.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Not a song on this album that I wouldn't want to listen to, but my favorite (reminds one of his old-school tunes) is SATISFIED.
B00068NVI4|2.0|I love yes. I wore out three \\"Yes Fragile\\" albums, and 2 \\"Close to the Edge\\". YES was known as the band that traveled with so much lighting and sound gear that they had convoys.  They could do no wrong in my eyes.    When I saw this DVD, which I purchased based on the ratings, as  many other Yes disks were not rated well. (Like Live in Phili).  Makes me wonder if the band has any say in what is released?    I was stunned. I saw Steve Howe, and could not believe how  I thought to myself, this may be the last time I see the guy.  Some of his acoustic work on older songs is aweful. But he is much older than in 1979 right??  No surprise, we all are.  After watching much of the disk, and coming to \\"Roundabout\\", I almost  fell off my chair as I watched them play at about 1/3 tempo.  Extensive drums during most of the show consits of a \\"Hi-hat, a Base drum, a rider cymbal, and a snare drum, that is it. Being a drummer for 18 years, I know this music cold, and I till this day play most yes with music in front of me. Especially songs like \\"Roundabout\\".  They sit through much of the concert. I honestly thought Howe should be in a wheel Chair. He looks weak and tired.    I prefer to remember them for the great band they were in the 70's, and not remember them as \\"beyond AARP age\\".  It is upsetting, but I suppose now at 44 myself, we are all getting older.  I even took notice of all the shots when he walked through the audience, most of the \\"Guys\\" at the show had \\"male pattern baldness\\".  Unlike the Stones, or Zep, or Who, Black Sabbath/Oz, who also have young followers, Yes does not appear to have nearly as many followers in the younger Gen X and Gen Y.    As a drummer I have so much respect for this band.  Yes was the inventors of \\"Rock/Jazz Fusion\\", or \\"Rock/Progressive Jazz\\".  I could play nearly any other band's music from memory after some practice. Not the case with all Yes songs often.  If I sit down and play \\"Roundabout\\", or even \\"And you and I\\", \\"Close to the edge\\" (Not on this DVD), I need the drum music, and I am a good drummer.    Maybe because of the fact that I put YES on the top of my list,  higher than all the other bands I mentioned, I feel this way about  this DVD, and honestly it depressed me.
0975991477|3.0|In the shadow of so many rave reviews of \\"The Biology of Belief,\\" I don't wish to be a \\"downer\\" on Bruce Lipton's book but believe each person to have their own opinion.  Bruce Lipton has written a fascinating book about his observations of the smaller things in life (living and cloned cells) and the affect that thoughts as energy have on our general well being.  I do not dispute Lipton's theories; I work earnestly to keep my own compass pointed in the right direction and have seen benefits that I would not otherwise be able to explain.  Mr. Lipton seemed misleading with the choice of his full title \\"The Biology of Belief, Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles.\\"  The biology was evident in every page, but the unleashing of the power of consciousness was not.  Bruce Lipton mentions that he himself changed the outlook of his life by a matter of adjusting his attitude and would lead you to an explanation of how in later chapters.  As I read from chapter to chapter I was disappointed that Lipton doesn't share his exercises for success, but promotes a companions system of PSYCH-K in the addendum.  \\"The Biology of Belief\\" does illustrate how the world can work for those who believe and can inspire some to continue to look harder at the thoughts they keep.  For those who are looking for a more \\"how to\\" text, you may want to return to \\"The Biology of Belief\\" later.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I have to say it, \\"Brick\\" is probably the best movie I have seen this year so far, and I don't think I'll see another that will top it.  I had heard about \\"Brick\\" for a while now, and when I heard the premise of it, I knew that it was something that I would have to check out.  I'm glad I did, because not only did I end up enjoying it the first time I saw it, but I watched it again the next day.  Not many films can do that for me, but this one most certainly did.  There was no way I could have ever bet that I would've ended up loving this movie the way I do.<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with the approach to the movie, it's pretty much a detective-murder-whodunit movie with a catch; it's set in modern times and it involves high school kids.  Yet, the kids talk in the manner that you would expect from your typical hard-boiled detective movie.  The story concerns Brendan Frye, who is contacted by his ex-girlfriend by phone.  On the phone, she sounds frightened and troubled, but doesn't say much about what is the matter.  Two days later, she ends up dead.  Brendan knows that she got involved with the wrong crowd, so in order to find out who is responsible for her death and why, he has to go in deep into the underground drug world that has consumed a good amount of his schoolmates.  The deeper he goes, the more risk he puts himself in.<br /><br />This film is extremely well done and well made, and that caught me off guard.  I wasn't expecting a movie like this, nor was I expecting that I would end up loving it so much.  The film seems innocent and fun at a glance until you really get into it, and then you realize how dark and brutal it can get.  Just because it involves high school kids, it doesn't mean it's child's play.  It's film noir at its finest, and it even pokes fun at itself a little here and there, but overall it's a pretty dark and serious movie.  What really sells the movie in the end is the great performances from the cast, especially the lead actor.<br /><br />Because of how odd and different \\"Brick\\" is, there's a good chance that more people will end up not liking it so much.  That is the risk these kinds of movies take, but it's nice to see something that isn't so \\"commercial friendly\\" for a change.  It stands out, and that's something that has to be admired to some degree.  I would recommend renting it first because of this.  Also, I recommend that you see it more than once.  As much as I liked it the first time, I really appreciated it for what it was more during the second viewing.  The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer, sadly.  There are some deleted/extended scenes, audition tapes from two of the actors in the movie, and cast/crew commentary.  It's a shame that they don't give you the trailer, which I thought was really good.  I also would've liked to see some behind-the-scenes features.<br /><br />\\"Brick\\" took me for a ride and I have to say that I loved every minute of it.  It's an exhilarating and brilliant film that takes a lot of chances without apologizing to anybody in the end.  It's one you'll either love or hate, but I think it's definitely worth the time checking it out.  If you're looking for something that isn't typical or dull, then I highly recommend it.  It's too soon to say, but I think if you give it enough time it could become a classic.  It's high up on my list of favorite movies now, and that only took two days.  -Michael Cranebr /> <br />Because of how odd and different \\"Brick\\" is, there's a good chance that more people will end up not liking it so much.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|Having been fortunate enough to listen to Pat and the Group since 1985, I look forward to each and every release.  I was definitely not disappointed when this one came out, and of course, I rushed out to buy it.  I have never seen 68 minutes go by so fast, as this recording just gets better with every listen!  Pat, of course, gives his usual flawless performance.  Lyle Mays, Steve Rodby, Antonio Sanchez, Cuong Vu, Gregoire Maret, and Nando Lauria also add so much to this recording.  I had the pleasure of seeing them perform this live twice in 2005.  There is no other artists I would pay to see, except PMG, play live.  I do not see how they do it, each night, playing 2 1/2-3 hours each night.  No other musician even comes close to Pat Metheny, I don't care what genre.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I had heard many of my friends talk about how great this movie was and how much I'd like it.  I'm a big David Lynch fan and several people said that I would love this because of that.  I rented this via Netflix, and before I'd even sent it back, I had ordered it.  It's very intense and very emotional, and for those of you who love extras, this DVD offers them for you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you're a fan of Lynch, and for anyone who's not, it's actually much easier to understand than a lot of his work.<br /><br />Trust me when I say that you should shell out the extra few bucks for the director's cut.  It's well worth it.
1932100660|5.0|After multiple recommendations, I ordered this book and prepared to study. No dull moments here: the evidence is eye-opening. The book tells you in roughly 12 or so pages what you should eat and why, and then provides detailed, footnoted background studies. We are believers! Our breakfast, lunch and dinners have been changed forever for the good. Thank you, Dr. Campbell.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah went back to basics with this record. Bringing the old classic Mariah that made her a vocal force in the 90s, mixing it with her songwriting abilities, and a great vibe of grooves from a few great producers...she managed to pull it off and came up with this brilliant album! With retro-style R&B/Soul flavor to dance-club hip hop grooves while making the main focal point, which is THE VOICE ~ it's one of the best albums she's ever recorded alongisde 1997's 'Butterfly' album.<br /><br />This record is highly recommended.
B00097A5HW|5.0|It is as good as expected and more. All the songs are great, maybe with the exception of 6. Escondite Ingles. My personal favorites are 2. La Pared 7. No and 8. Las de la Intuicion. If you like Shakira this is a must have, especially for those that loved her previous spanish language albums.
B0006UYOJM|5.0|Here's another great Steve Hoffman mastering job. This is a CD that leaves its vinyl versions in the dust. The bass will give your subwoofer a workout and literally shake your teeth. The drums are crisp and the snares rattle. Rod Stewart sounds amazingly rough and Ronnie Woods guitars cut like a knife. This is definitely a must buy.
B00005JKC3|5.0|This movie was excellent. The changes they made in the stories origin made sense. I liked the acting, and I found the movie to be very entertaining. The CGI hulk wasn't the best, but as far as I'm concerned, the action scenes dipicted in this movie are easily the best of the Hulk ever made period. Nothing else comes close. If you've ever read the Incredible Hulk comic you'll love this movie. The Hulk you see in the comic book is the same Hulk you see in this movie. The fights in the deserts, the dog fight...nothing before this movie ever came close. Simply put it's the best Hulk ever done, and a great movie in it's own right.
B00000IGGA|5.0|The first sound you hear on pressing play is a grinding, grating blues tune with heavily distorted, humorous lyrics.  It's hard to distinguish this song from noise.  And for a moment, you think this album may be hard to listen to, even for a Tom Waits album.  As the first few songs progress, though, something strange begins to unfold.  Waits is doing more than entertaining his own love of outcasts.   He's doing more than having fun with styles and words. <br /> <br />Tom Waits is older and wiser, as they say.  On this album, Waits is wistful, sorrowful, and spiritual.  Yeah, he growls at us.  Yeah, he throws a couple oddballs at us.  But, for lack of a better word, he's got SOUL here.  And the music of a man struggling with his soul can't help but be beautiful. <br /> <br />Perhaps, then, it is no coincidence that the best of the album are the tracks that sound like somber negro spirituals and really early roots blues, songs like \\"Cold Water,\\" \\"Chocolate Jesus,\\" \\"Georgia Lee,\\" and \\"Come on up to the House.\\"  They're juxtaposed with the wistful tunes of a man looking back, sometimes in quiet joy, sometimes in quiet despair, like \\"Hold On,\\" \\"Pony,\\" and \\"The House Where Nobody Lives.\\" <br /> <br />In fact, \\"quiet\\" is a great word for Mule Variations.  The volume doesn't always stay down, but the songs are simple and slow.  The first track seems to belie what follows, but hit repeat, and when the first track comes back, it suddenly fits.  It's not funny; it's kind of sad. <br /> <br />All of which makes this album sound like a downer.  It's not.  It's interesting and absorbing and I can't let it go, and as the last track starts, I can't help but feel good about life.  If you get Tom Waits, this album will feel like home.
B00006I53S|5.0|When I say outstanding, I'm comparing it with my 24-105 f/4 L IS lens, my 28-75 2.8 Tamron, the original 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS kit lens and just for a high bar my 70-200 f/2.8 IS L (nothing beats that one).  I've found that when using the EF lenses on a cropped sensor camera like my 30D and 20D, some of the \\"lesser\\" lenses perform very well because they're using the center \\"sweet\\" spot of the lens.  Taking this into consideration for this review, I've found it very hard to tell the difference in photos between the 24-105 L lens and the 28-135 non-L lens.  The 24-105 L lens is built more sturdily, has the constant f/4 apperature, and has extra weather-proofing but the 28-135 lens is less than half the cost, has IS, and gains 30mm in zoom.  So seriously, if you aren't thinking about buying your lenses for the day when you upgrade to a full size sensor camera body, the 28-135 lens, for the price, is a fantastic deal.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Life is Beautiful is a film by Roberto Benigni, which really showcases his talent before he made an embarassing stab at playing Pinocchio. \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is probably my favorite Foreign film (I've only seen probably 5 though); It's funny, heartfelt, has wonderful performances, and is all around a joy to watch. It also happens to be a layered film, that goes in one direction before veering off into another but never losing it's charm. Benigni plays Guido, a waiter with a humorous streak. After Guido contantly stumbles into Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), he falls in love with her and the movie (with no warning) flashes forward a number of years. This first half of the film (which is a little over 50 minutes) is pretty much a romantic-comedy. The second half is quite different. In the second half, Guido and Dora (who now have a young son named Joshua) live in Italy which is overrun with Germans. Subsequently, Guido and Joshua are taken into a concentration camp; Dora also goes to the camp, but under different circumstances which are a bit unbelievable but still a nice part of the story. Anyway, Guido employs his quick-wit to keep his son from the horrors of the camp; Guido tells Josh that it's actually an elaborate game and that he must avoid being seen. If, at the end, he does everything he's told and racks up the most \\"points\\" he will get a tank. Benigni (who is also the co-writer and director) does something that's never been done. He takes a horrifying setting (a concentration camp) and turns it into a comedy, without exploting anything and without losing heart. <br />The film takes a sad turn in the end, which I think adds to it's realism. If it had a completely happy ending, I don't think it would work as well. Even if you're not a person who watches foreign film, this is an absolute masterpiece and to not see this film would be a mistake. This is a wonderful film, with Benigni (who I think is the first person to win an Oscar for Best Actor for a foreign languagefilm, although I could be wrong) giving an absolutely delightful performance. I really don't see how someone could not enjoy this film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
1592400876|5.0|Eats Shoots and Leaves is the perfect punctuation reference.  \\"Out with the old,\\" I say! <br /> <br />Lynn Truss wrote a complete and concise reference of whom, what, and why each figure of punctuation is necessary; who created the mark, the history of the mark, and examples of the proper use of grammar.  Several punctuation marks are on the brink of extinction - as they continue their use becomes less and less; there are some that remain necessary to proper grammar (i.e., hesitation, half pause).  <br /> <br />Finally, a proper reference of punctuation for perfect grammar.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against the Machine is a band I only started listening to out of curiosity. I'd never heard any of their music, but I had gotten into Audioslave and wanted to see what these guys were like. Rage is a unique band in many ways. First off, this album (their final album, which was called Album of the Year by many Rock magazines; Even Time Magazine in fact) is amazing. Every song is good and not just in the sense, it's not bad. You can listen to each of these songs a few times over, there's not one track I'd skip over while listening to it. Tom Morello (who does stuff with a guitar that the best guitar players in the world couldn't do) is in top form; Tim Commerford cranks out some great basslines here (most notably in \\"Calm Like a Bomb\\"), and Brad Wilk is of course great. Zack De La Rocha's vocals and lyrics are very angry and very political here; He makes some genuine points though. That's one of the things I find most impressive about Rage. A lot of bands that do political songs, wind up with good lyrics and bad songs. It doesn't even matter if you're listening to the lyrics on this album; The music is still completely enjoyable. If you're looking to buy a really good CD, then get this. Here are the tracks and occasional in-depth commentary: <br /> <br />1. Testify-5/5 <br />2. Guerilla Radio-5/5-One of my favorite songs on the album. <br />3. Calm Like a Bomb-5/5-One of my favorite Rage songs. It's really catchy and you can't beat Tom Morrello's riffs. <br />4. Mic Check-5/5-I love the lyrics; I love the chorus. Great song. <br />5. Sleep Now in the Fire-5/5-The guitar riff in this song is awesome. As are the lyrics; One of my favorite songs on here. <br />6. Born of a Broken Man-5/5-Zack De La Rocha speaks the verses and then pours energy into the chorus. I know some people who don't like this song, I love it. <br />7. Born as Ghosts-5/5-My 2nd favorite song on the album. <br />8. Maria-5/5 <br />9. Voice of the Voiceless-5/5-It's short, but it's a great song.<br />10. New Millenium Homes-5/5-This probably ties as my 2nd favorite song. It sounds a little like Bulls on Parade, but the lyrics and music are awesome. <br />11. Ashes in the Fall-5/5-The music is awesome. De La Rocha whispering \\"Like ashes in the fall\\" is kind of creepy; Angry lyrics that definitely get their point across. <br />12. War Within a Breath-5/5-And a very impressive album closer. Some of the best drumming is on this track.  <br />GRADE: A <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Let me re-answer a question posted earlier-is this any less punk than \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Kerplunk?\\"  The answer is no, it isn't.  Sure it's overplayed and teen-boppers with Simple Plan Shirts talk about how hot Bill Joe is, sure they toured with \\"My Chemical Romance.\\"  It's not their fault.  The radio plays the songs of this cd until it bores me to tears.  But lets not forget, this is Green Day we're talking about here.  They're not johnny-come-newbies like New Found Glory who are teenagers in 22-year old bodies who are obsessed with partying and finding girlfriends.  They're maturer and much better than that.  Anybody who remembers the Ramones and Social Distortion Era knows what Punk is really about.  Listen to the lyrics of the song on this cd.  They mean every word they say.  Don't trash Green Day for being overplayed.  Popular isn't necissarily better.    I saw Green Day on this tour, and they definately still have it in them.  Only complaint-my best friend wasn't there (this is our landmark cd).    Breakdown:  1.American Idiot-This is a good song, it's just overplayed, and I'm tired of it.  No fault of the band's  2.Jesus Of Subburbia-okay, c'mon, listen to this meddley and tell me if you hear a trace of pop.  3.Holiday-see #3  4.Boulevard, or I Walk Alone-doesn't matter how many times this song is played, there is just something about it.  5. Are We The Waiting-One of my favorites, the lyrics have a lot of meaning!  6.St. Jimmy- POP MY A**!  7. Give Me Novocaine-good song, this leads into..  8. She's A Rebel- this one.  Again, pop my a**  9. Extraordinary girl-like the begining of this one, Green Day's growth and enhancement of creativity shines here  10.Letterbomb-this could have been off Dookie or Insomniac  11. Wake Me Up When Sept. Ends-this is the only thing that comes close to pop.  But even pop can be good.  this song came out at EXACTLY the right \\"relationship\\" time!  12.Homecomming-Meddly number 2, a lot like the first  13.Whatsername-name isn't important.The face is!    Give it about 5 years.  It'll burn out.  Then give it another try if it wore thin on you.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Hours of trippy pink floyd. This is why high end audio and large tv sets exist. It leaves one \\"comfortably numb.\\"
0316172324|4.0|\\"Blink\\" starts explosively, presenting a hypothesis which would probably come as a shock and a revelation to most people. Gladwell quickly makes a strong case for the equality of instantaneous decisions with detailed, analyzed decision-making, through a series of disparate but consistently powerful case studies.  <br /> <br />The book then moves onto explaining why the quick-fix decision making process works so often, the core of the explanation lying in the ability of the brain to \\"thin slice\\" i.e. recognize the few key pieces of information in any situation required to make sense of it, made possible by the human brain's ability to process efficiently and rapidly copious quantities of information stored in the human unconscious.  <br /> <br />It is here that the book begins to falter, for instead of delving deeper into the theory, Gladwell starts presenting related concepts and a never-ending string of case studies. While the case studies individually make for interesting reading, collectively, they become burdensome. The book's weakest part comes into light only after substantial passage, when one realizes that Gladwell is really not going to provide much insight into how one can begin to harness the power of \\"blink\\" decision-making and make it more effective for ourselves.  <br /> <br />To Gladwell's credit, however, the book is written in a lucid and interesting style, making complex concepts highly accessible for the layman. Finally, the book is genuinely thought-provoking, which in itself is a sufficient reason for adding this book to one's collection.
B000009VOL|3.0|Among fans, MoonPix holds a kind of mystique. Stories get told. One goes something like this: Chan Marshall, retired from the music industry, awakens one stormy night after a bad dream. In an agitated fugue state, she furiously writes the whole of MoonPix in one sitting. The following day (still driven by night demons mind you) she calls her surprised record label and sweet talks an executive into sending her to Australia--land of the Dingo, the Aborigine, the Cane Toad--to record a moody batch of pathos ridden devil songs. The result is a spooky, haunted album, by a half-crazy girl. It goes on to be a notable success for Cat Power.<br /><br />Well,... that's the story anyway.<br /><br />Fans seem to like that myth a lot. Maybe they overpraise the album because of it? Rate it highly, despite its many flaws? All I can tell you is what I hear in Moon Pix. One thing is certain, the album is a giant leap forward over the earliest Cat Power albums. The singing, production, arrangements, and songs are all considerably better than those on Dear Sir and Myra Lee. But then those early albums set the bar so awfully low that even vast improvement still leaves us with only an okay album. On the up side, the songs \\"Metal Heart\\", \\"Cross Bones Style,\\" and \\"No Sense\\" are great songs, best appreciated independently of the rest of the album. I like the direction Chan Marshall and her band are heading with these songs. The musicianship is well improved over previous works (though that's not much of a claim, considering the previous works). More importantly, the band avoids the endless Sonic Youth dissonance that marred the first albums.<br /><br />The rest of Moon Pix could still benefit from quite a bit more polishing. All the songs share the same or similar sounds. Similar chord changes, tempo, key; and let's just admit it, Chan Marshall can't really play any instrument. Any grade schooler with a couple of years of piano lessons could play piano with more authority than she does. The same is true of her two or three chord guitar work. She fingerpicks a few cowboy chords and occasionally bumbles even on those. In the very first song \\"American Flag,\\" there's a clumsy moment a minute and a half into it where she messes up and gets out of sync with the drum machine. What's odd to me is she seems to be surrounded by much better musicians. One wonders why she doesn't just stick to singing and let one of the other guys handle the heavy lifting?<br /><br />Previous reviewers have mentioned how this is good music for a rainy day--indeed, there are thunder sounds on \\"Say\\". A nice touch. I could see how you might like the continuous monodrone sound of this record if you're looking for ambient music to serve you on a down day when you're feeling reflective. On the other hand, if you're trying to fight off sadness, laziness, or mood swings, this is not the album to put on. Take \\"Moonshiner\\" for example; it's heroin music--sluggish, lethargic, hypnotic--written for the loser, the loner, the addict, the drunk. It wouldn't be out of place on a Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album.<br /><br />Not all the songs are complete downers, nor do they all neccesarily contain deep mystical insights from a crazy hell-haunted woman. It is true there are a few important songs on this record, spooky and beautiful enough to justify repeated listening. But taken as a whole album Moon Pix sounds endlessly droning and burned out. For me, too much so. One critic (when commenting on how problematic Cat Power albums tend to be) said Chan's \\"probably an EP artist at heart\\". I think that's about right. With the exception of The Greatest, none of her albums are really able to sustain the momentum of her best individual songs.<br /><br />If you're new to Cat Power or are trying to figure out which album to buy first, buy the most recent albums: The Greatest (if you're into R&B), You Are Free (if you're looking for indie rock), or The Cover Record (if you like folksy blues). Each are superior to Moon Pix--though none carry the kind of mythos that has made Moon Pix so famous. Perhaps one day Matador will release a \\"best of\\" album. Chan Marshall is great when you can just to get to those wonderful (but sparsely distributed) jewel songs that are buried somewhere on each album.erior to Moon Pix--though none carry the kind of mythos that has made Moon Pix so famous.

B000FS9FCQ|2.0|I have never read the Alan Moore graphic novel but I suspect it is worthy of the hype. This movie however is not. This movie is a rehash of various other cultural representations: most notably Big Brother and Hitler's Germany circa 1940. I can get behind stories about overthrowing oppression and injustice but this movie had nothing new to deliver. Yes V is the shady hero who was `created' by the government state and eventually brings their power to an end. This theme has been done by better novels and films so many times I can't even begin to list them all. Needless to say, this film offers nothing exciting or new to the genre.<br /><br />If I had known the screenplay was written by the Matrix brothers I never would have seen this film. These clowns are still running from the crime scene of the Matrix sequels and some producer figured they could get another yacht or two if they adapted another comic book to the big screen. Big mistake. I actually fell asleep watching this movie, and that hasn't happened since I saw some diseased Jennifer Lopez movie.<br /><br />A huge disappointment in the film is the Natalie Portman character. Portman has the accent down but that's the only good thing about this gig. Her character is lame. She is a nonentity in a film that focuses her as the main character (I think). Basically this girl has been oppressed and wronged by the government but when she `awakens' or whatever, she turns into a window shopper for a year. She literally just walks the streets.<br /><br />Anyway, I can imagine the Matrix brothers typing away at their computers with lofty goals of blending the `1984' genres into something new and cool. In the end, this movie does nothing of the sort. It is predictable, unoriginal and tiresome. And what is up with the crappy cartoonish violence? Not good like the over the top Kill Bill, but boring and leaves me asking why?
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I've seen \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" many many times, and I bought the DVD to show my grandchildren what life was like and still is for many farmworkers. The Mexican farmworkers also went thru alot of hardships trying to survive and barely exist on what little they earned by harvesting the crops in California, Texas, Idaho, etc. etc.  I show my Grandchildren this film to show the importance of getting an education, so as to break the cycle of living impoverished by working in the fields.  Also, the more education you have, then you can do more to bring about justice to the lives of FarmWorkers by getting involved in making changes, and sometimes taking risks. I lived that life, so I know what I am talking about when I mentioned the hardhsips one had to endure in order to survive! and I enjoyed the way the film is told and Henry Fonda has always been one of my favorite Actors , as well as his daughter Jane Fonda. I recommend this movie to anyone that wishes to understand the plight of the Farmworker, whether they be \\"Oakies\\",\\"Mexican\\",Filipinos\\", etc. <br />Its a great !! Movie. This Movie will open your eyes.

B000002JS6|5.0|The quote comes from an old copy of GUITAR WORLD magazine:\\"Call this album McMetal, with over one billion served.' I have to agree. However, while McDonald's burgers and fries are empty and devoid of anything useful, BACK IN BLACK has sustained me in many a moment of despair. When I need that adrenaline rush to make through a tough time, the title track blaring from the speakers in my Jeep works nicely. And when I'm feeling mischevious, YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG is the perfect soundtrack. Throw in ROCK AND ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION, and you round out the perfect soundtrack to a middle-aged headbanger's life.

I find it in the bathroom, playroom, tv room.  It's home is in their bedroom closet but it never finds it's way back there because it is always out.  The animals and the boat are in constant use.<br /><br />Yes it is a lot of money for plastic, but playmobil quality cannot be beat!  We have many playmobil sets and the other guys and animals have all found their way onto the ark.  It has even endured collisions with the Playmobil airplane!<br /><br />Playmobil toys are one of those collections you spend more money trying to duplicate so that you don't have to spend the money on it.  Then finally you realize that there is no substitute!  My boys always play with their playmobil sets.<br /><br />I only wish we had a little girl so I could have bought the dollhouses!<br /><br />YOu cannot go wrong with playmobil!
B000001FI7|4.0|It looks like it's all been said about this album by now. Few would argue that \\"Dummy\\" is the essential Portishead disc, and possibly the epitome of the genre. Smooth, creepy, sexy, and hypnotic. It definitely sets a mood. The production and beats are a perfect match to Beth's vocals. If there was a hit here it would be \\"Sour Times\\", but the entire disc holds up to that track, and some are much better I think. This album seems to have no equal, and if it did I suppose it would be Massive Attack's \\"Mezzanine\\". Just opinion of course. If you suspect you might like this, you won't. You'll love it.
0066620996|5.0|I don't have a bone in my body that is inclined toward business.  I was a high school chemistry teacher and now work for my church.  So, I didn't read this book to learn about business.  I read it to learn about leadership.  And what a great choice it was. <br /> <br />I was surprised that my first foray into the world of business books was so utterly readable.  Though I didn't understand every single point, Collins manages to write in a very digestible way, while maintaining sufficient intellectual rigor.  I was absolutely fascinated by many of the observations that he made in light of his group's research and admired the fact that they clearly avoided the temptation to work the data to produce an intended result.  Instead, they allowed the research to drive the conclusions, which makes the take-home messages that much more legitimate. <br /> <br />What I loved about the book is that its applications seem to be almost universal.  Though there are clearly realities that separate the smallest minutiae from everyday application in my worlds of education and church work, I am confident that I will be able to use this book to shape the way that I lead.  I hope to continue to develop toward Level 5 leadership, and I will endeavor to lead my church to confront the brutal facts (which many people don't like to do in the church) and identify our Hedgehog Concept (which many people also don't like to do in the church). <br /> <br />I am glad that Collins labored through this research project, as the potential benefits pervade all sectors of society.  I look forward to reading his follow-up monograph to see how he distinguishes these findings for non-profit organizations.  In any case, I would recommend \\"Good to Great\\" to any leader in the corporate world or social sector.  There is much to be learned from his work.

B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney and his terrific co-stars in \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou?\\" create colorfully believable characters who present moviegoers with a comic reflection on a period in American History we might well forget. Thank goodness for this movie because I believe the popularity of the plot along with the excellent CD movie track will keep America's dark secret of discrimination practiced in pre-World War II Mississippi from falling off our cultural landscape. Couched inside the politically correct safety blanket of colloquial comedy, the three escaped prisoners (Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)take on individual situations of racial prejudice in Mississippi, with unlikely charm and innocence, in contrast to the seriousness of the issues. All the while they are on the lamb, the three men are becoming popular with southern country music lovers because they serendipitously recorded a song with a blind radio producer who didn't know they had latched on to a Negro guitar player - thus creating a de-segregated or \\"mulatto\\" performing group.  Charles Durning is a favorite actor of mine, and his performance as the incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel is memorable for his colorful irreverence for hyperbole but also for his refreshing political honesty. This movie is worth seeing over again because it leaves Americans with something to remember about our past - so we're not doomed to re-live it.  Although the movie is loosely based on Homer's \\"Odyssey\\", this analogy doesn't really cut it with the elite set - rather, this movie is about what it's about,  and I don't believe it should be given any pseudo-intellectual accoutrements. It's simply a gem.
B000G759LW|3.0|The tracks destined to be singles have really (I mean really) generic lyrics. These singles are danceable and catchy but to anyone older than 16, they are complete fluff.  Teenage girls will love this CD until they move onto something else 2 months from now.  <br /> <br />The studio production is too slick for its own good. With Aguilera's amazing voice there's no need for all of the digital processing.  <br /> <br />Will anyone be listening to this a few years from now?  No. The problem is that Christina is a powerful voice lacking a definable personnality in her own music.  She's just aping the song styles of current and previous decades.   <br />
B000AARKOO|4.0|I liked this movie for the obvious reasons, good direction, good acting, and good action.  But, the best thing about this movie, in this Hermit Crab's view, is that it isn't just about the action scenes at all.  In fact, there are very few extended battles scenes, saving the one at the end.  It is more a tale of what true honor is all about, about staying true to your heart and never selling your soul out.  This is a message that needs to be integrated into movies, and society itself, more often.  Also, it has a strange parallel to what is going on in the Middle East right now.  Peace be with you always!

B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I've never really been a punk music fan, maybe because I never took the time to appreciate it.  So when a buddy of mine fired up the song Behind Closed Doors off the new Rise Against album two weeks ago, I was surprised by how quickly I wanted more.  Having since acquired the whole album, turns out I can't stop listening to the whole damn thing start to finish.   <br />   The whole cd is solid and well-produced, leaving the old-school punk in the dust with kickass guitar riffs, slick drumming, and catchy-as-hell choruses and bridges that make you want to shout along.  I agreee that some of the lyrics can get a bit lost in the overproduced guitars, but that only serves to make me listen even more intently. <br />   I immediately loved the songs Injection, Ready to Fall, Brick (how do they fit so much energy into a minute and a half?)and Behind Closed Doors, with the rest of the songs growing on me every time I heard them.  I even don't mind the very emo-ish The Approaching Curve, as it totally redeems itself with the final line in the song, which leaves you thinking \\"wow...cool.\\"  Now I'm can't stop listening to the last song Survive, which says in a nutshell - suck it up, stop being a wuss, and get back in the human race.  Rise Against manages to get their point across without being overly political and slamming you in the face with their principles.  In a music industry where every artist thinks they are studio-politicians, I really appreciate that.   <br />    I've since gotten ahold of RA's two earlier albums, but I haven't stopped listening to The Sufferer and the Witness long enough to get into them.  In due time, I'll check them out.  And in response RodgeDodge's disparaging remarks about RA and punk in general, I'd like to add that yes Rodge, the old punk may be dead, but Rise Against isn't trying to be old punk.  Perhaps you should take the confederate flag down from your front yard and respect this new genre for what it is - entertaining and engaging.

B000GGSM76|4.0|CD Review: The Cure - The Head On The Door: Remastered And Expanded Edition <br /> <br />Have you ever been to a concert where nobody showed up?  <br /> <br />I've actually been to a number of these type of shows over the years. I can remember for example seeing Genesis with Peter Gabriel around the time of Selling England By The Pound with about 50 other people in the 8000 seat capacity Seattle Center Arena. The crowd was so small they actually put the stage in the center of the arena and had one full half of the place curtained off. Genesis themselves, God Bless Em', still delivered their full theatrical spectacle even if it must've felt more like a dress rehearsal to them. So roughly fifty delighted fans we're treated to Peter Gabriel complete with his various fox heads and masks, weaving his stories around the wildly progressive for the time sounds of Genesis at a creative peak, years before they devolved into the worst formula rock band of all time under Phil Collins leadership. <br /> <br />I had another such experience seeing The Cure about ten years later in the same building. Same deal. A curtained off stage in the center of the arena this time before a slightly more respectable crowd of about 200 devotees decked out in various shades of gothic black.  <br /> <br />My interest in the band at the time was strictly casual as the darker sides of my musical taste ran more to bands like Echo And The Bunnymen and the lesser known Chameleons. So I really didn't know what to expect from the band who would soon launch a million or so covens of goth kids around the globe.  <br /> <br />In a word, The Cure were dark. Very dark.  <br /> <br />So much so it prompted the friend I went with to come up with one of the most original one sentence reviews of a concert I've ever heard.  <br /> <br />By the second song my friend looked over at me and said, \\"Glen, it's midnight and the crows are beckoning.\\" It was at once the most hilarious and the most accurate description of what we saw on that particular night I've ever heard.  <br /> <br />But there was also some very interesting musical terrain being mined by the Cure onstage that night. In between all of the darker hues, you could make out some very distinctive pop hooks and even a hint of funk in the basslines. Underneath the wiry jet black hair and pasty white facial makeup, Robert Smith was also an impressive vocalist who managed to somehow make the dark detachment of his songs sound almost, well emotional. <br /> <br />About a year after that show The Cure released The Head On The Door, the album many fans cite as the record which began The Cure's evolution from the goth dungeonmasters that I saw in concert that night into the worldwide pop phenomenon that produced a string of hit albums like Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me and Disintegration.  <br /> <br />And make no mistake about it, with The Head On The Door, Robert Smith was intent on broadening the musical canvas of The Cure. Coming off what was arguably The Cure's most non-commercial album ever, The Top, The Head On The Door sounds like a downright collection of pop singles by comparison. <br /> <br />The themes of darkness and isolation are still prevalent and the album still has enough minor chords to keep the black nail polish crowd happy. But there are plenty of hints here at the poppier direction to come, most notably on tracks like the leadoff \\"In Between Days\\" and the hit single \\"Close To Me.\\"  <br /> <br />On \\"Kyoto Song\\", Smith incorporates oriental brushstrokes into the mix. On the album's standout track \\"A Night Like This,\\" the band mines a more familiar dark drone which is then broken up about midway through by the sort of gorgeous sounding sax solo you'd find more at home on a Supertramp record.  <br /> <br />Returning bass player Simon Gallup again provides a hard funk bottom popping his way through what would otherwise be more standard Cure fare like \\"Screw.\\" The seeming contrast of a decidedly funkier rhythm section and the more standard doom and gloom of The Cure actually works remarkably well throughout The Head On The Door. <br /> <br />On the remastered treatment of this new version from Rhino, those nuances--from Gallup's bass popping to the broader textures added to the Cure's trademark drone--are newly enhanced in the mix, making this reissue that all too rare case where the treatment is actually warranted. The recording here is mixed several notches brighter, allowing the high end to shine far above the droning low of the original version. <br /> <br />The bonus disc is also truly a real bonus. Nearly all of Head's original 10 tracks appear here in various stages of their growth in demo versions. The result is a rare glimpse into the actual creative process where you are able to almost visualize these songs as they began to take shape. On \\"A Night Like This\\" for example, the smooth sax solo of the final version veers into more experimental territory, sounding almost like something out of the Coltrane book of avant garde jazz. <br /> <br />Rhino has also reissued new remastered versions of The Top and Kiss Me, Kiss Me which I will most definitely check out based on the results here. If those reissues are anywhere near as surprisingly good as this, this represents an all too rare example of the label getting it right, rather than just simply cashing in. <br />

The album ends on an odd note, with 22 minutes of ambient music, which is sometimes barely audible.  This album is a fitting \\"last word\\" from Queen.

0451526384|5.0|Those who read PERSUASION by Jane Austen tend to view it as a book primarily concerned with marriage in the typical Austen romantic comedy sense of young ladies seeking to marry upward and young men also seeking partners--but not necessarily to each other.  While much of Austen's novel deals with precisely that, to view this solitary strand of thought as Austen's most telling point is surely to miss that point totally.  In PERSUASION, Austen took her earlier PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and sought to show that her view on how single women relate to their families, their friends, their proposed husbands and to society at large underwent a significant change from the latter to the former.     In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, Austen places Elizabeth Bennett squarely in the traditional role of the 18th century woman who sought somehow to gain economic equality with men in such a way so as not to upset or circumvent the established social order that dictated that women must obey their parents and marry the men whom they selected as suitable candidates.  Miss Bennett uses reason and general smarts to cause changes in Darcy that would in turn cause changes in the larger social order that acted as a behind the scenes puppeteer. The comedy then was a function of a small change in Miss Bennett causing a larger one in Darcy. In PERSUASION, Austen takes the similar plot of a young woman breaking up with a man that perhaps needed breaking up with and updated it to include Anne Elliot doing much the same thing with Captain Wentworth. In Elizabeth Bennett's case, Darcy determined not be chased away.  In Anne Eliot's case, Wentworth made no such determination and left the scene for eight years.  The difference between the two acts of breaking up and their respective reconciliations did not lay in a profound change in the social order.  What changed was Jane Austen, who became more finely attuned to the winds of Romanticism that were then wafting from one country to another.  The relentless focus onrationalism that dominated the Augustan Age had slowly morphed over just a few decades to one in which human feeling and emotion trumped human reason.    Austen, in her choice of \\"Persuasion\\" as the title, subtly implied that what was at stake was not simply potential marriage partners waltzing a predictable if unstable dance towards the altar.  Rather, she wished to point the reader in the direction of seeing not only how and why persuasive rhetoric might impact on lovers' lives, but also to ascertain the consequences of treating emotional people as if they were devoid of those emotions. In Miss Bennett's case, \\"persuasion\\" was used in the context of rational discourse used to alter the world view of Darcy. In Anne Elliot's case, it was used to fortify the existing social order at the expense of using \\"right reason\\" to convince Anne to break up with Wentworth on the grounds that he was simply too low on the economic and social pecking order to marry a woman who is supposed to be a few rungs higher than he.  Actually, Austen satirizes Anne by implying that, if anything, her loftier position in society, exists mostly in her and her father's eyes, not at society's at large.  Anne differs from Elizabeth Bennett in that in PERSUASION, Anne sees that she has erred in being falsely persuaded but is allowed to show and vent emotion in re-establishing accepted marital order even if the somewhat stodgier and old-fashioned social order balks.  As Anne Elliot uses both head and heart to win back the love of a man who felt rightfully scorned for no good reason, Jane Austen focused attention on basic human romantic entanglements that for many frustrated lovers remain tangled even today.
B0002J519O|4.0|This mini-lp sleeve version of this Jazz classic is the best version that's out there at the moment.  The remastering job is quite good and so the sound quality is decent.  We also get both the English and Japanese lyrics thrown in as an insert.  The cardboard packaging which is a replica of the original vinyl sleeve is also a work of art.  While the strength of \\"Girl From Ipanema\\" alone would carry this album, we also get \\"So Danco Samba\\" and a version of \\"Desafinado\\" here which is good but not as great as the brilliant version with that unforgetable Getz solo on the \\"Jazz Samba\\" album which although not as commercially successful as this album, is still overall the stronger album.  Still, there is no denying the great impact this album has had on jazz and on bringing the whole samba genre onto the world map that this is still essential listening for fans of jazz and indeed for any fan of music in general.  Recommended.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Maybe you've heard that \\"it's all been done before.\\" Gaiman and McKean prove that wrong with this unique movie. It really is something new.<br /><br />McKean has worked for years in the comic industry, defining a visual style that works at a visceral level. The style has many ways to look, depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy. Some times McKean's work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone, other times it's a pen-scrawl of some horrible fear trying to waken. Disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience. I never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life - well, I was wrong. This movie's imagery defies easy description. I can only invite you to see it for yourself, and to experience a movie that is truly like no other. The small-screen video makes me regret missingn the big-screen theater experience.<br /><br />The sound track generally works well, too, from the surreal drone of Mrs. Bagwell's Victrola to the nightmare chant of the Jill-in-the-boxes during Helena's transformation. I'm not normally one to notice, but Mirrormask's music complements its look flawlessly.<br /><br />You didn't come here for the story: light and dark in conflict, lost mystic artifact, plucky youth, untrustworthy side-kick. The acting doesn't distinguish itself either, despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes. Stephanie Leonidas does a good job in the Helena role, with a convincing sulky/sultry mix. If you liked the acting in the original Dr. Who series, this will rise to your highest expectations.<br /><br />The story isn't the strength here. You'll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002C2E|5.0|In the era of grunge, boy bands, brainless female pop stars, bad indie rock, and just a crappy decade in general, came this masterpiece from Bob Dylan.  This album came from its own time, like all of Dylan's work.  This was a watershed when it came out. Dylan hadn't produced any new material in 7 years (the last album of new stuff he had done was Under the Red Sky, a mediocre album), and many weren't really paying attention to him anymore.  This album came out in 1997 and it really blew everyone away.  Not only was it a real work of art in a decade that didn't have too many of them, it re-established Dylan as the master that he is.  There is not one throwaway track on it. Every song is a masterpiece. The album has an epic quality like much of Dylan's best work, and it has some of the greatest songs he's ever written. Cold Irons Bound, Love Sick, Trying to Get to Heaven, and the epic Highlands are the best, but the rest of them are damn amazing too. Elvis Costello said this was Dylan's best.  A lot of people gave him flak for it, but he's pretty close. If it isn't Dylan's best, it's in the top five. It's the best album of the 1990's, deep, profound, moving, sad, sincere, and honest.  Fantastic work...
0451526295|3.0|In MANSFIELD PARK, Jane Austen expands her sphere of moral vision. In her earlier novels, she focused on the relationships between marriage partners that were framed in a comedic context of how the typical English society of the late 18th century might complicate the likelihood of a series of happy marriages. In this novel, however, she abandons the world of light and trifling romantic comedy for one in which she shows the unpleasant underside of the genteel society that was so noticeably lacking in say, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  This dark underside includes a number of troubling aspects, all of which are antithetical to the world of light comedy.<br /><br />First, Austen relentlessly considers the impact of the lack of moral values as a result of inadequate education of children.  The patriarch of the Bertram family, Sir Thomas, dearly loves his four children but he has given them a profligate style of life without teaching them how to live that life without being corrupted by its debilitating disadvantage of conspicuous consumption. Second, for the first time in her writing career, Austen boldly places the theme of good versus evil squarely on the interaction of several of her characters. The virtuous Edmund, who is as priestly as the collar that he wears on his neck, is tempted by the lascivious charms of the amoral Mary, who sees in Edmund only a fleeting diversion.  Further, Austen places London itself as a den of urban iniquity, the source of the theatrical evil that threatens the pastoral innocence of Mansfield Park.  Third, she calls into question some basic paradoxes about the nature of character itself.  Are peoples' characters fixed at birth or are they molded by environment? And when character is fixed, is it capable of change, and if so, by what, by whom, and to what extant? These latter questions come into play mostly in the person of Fanny, the outcast relative of the Bertram family who loves Edmund.  She is presented as impossibly virtuous, but in the face of her open defiance to marry the rich Henry Crawford, she is labeled as an ingrate and worse. No one in that group perceives her virtue, but the readers certainly do. From where does this virtue spring? It cannot be genetic since several others of her family are woefully deficient in virtue. It cannot be solely the result of environment since, except for the equally virtuous Edmund, the others treat her as uniformly unwanted and unloved.<br /><br />The answers to the above questions are raised, but only partially answered. Part of the problem in seeking answers to such eternal questions as love versus honor, duty versus obedience, and heredity versus environment in a novel is that this is a novel, and for Austen, a didactic one at that. Since she chooses to use a number of flat characters to represent allegorical archetypes of good and evil, their responses to their encounters cannot convey the full spectrum of thought that a more fully fleshed person might.  Further the many plots--the love affair between Fanny and Edmund, the plots of the Bertram sisters, and the interweaving of the many strands of plot between the Bertram children--combine to cause the reader to zero in on these many threads rather than ponder their potentially more universal significances.  What is lacking in MANSFIELD PARK is a pleasing balance and harmony among the many snipped strands of plot and theme which cry out for a splicing that does not occur even at the happy marriage of Edmund and Fanny.  This imbalance, combined with Austen's atypical use of realism and pressing social concerns, and her lack of a truly engaging heroine along the lines of Elizabeth Bennett, make MANSFIELD PARK a dutiful slog rather than a joyous read.
B0000024TT|5.0|I actually had this album when it was a record but I love Leonard Cohen's songs and when I didn't have a turntable anymore I wasn't able to play it. The impetus to get this CD was the movie \\"Leonard Cohen:I'm Your Man\\" which I saw recently and wanted to be able to hear his music at home. It's a great CD and probably the only one that has \\"The Master Song\\" on it. That's my fave song.
0553804367|5.0|It is not as amazing as time being relative, but the authors did manage to explain things still more clearly, in an even smaller book. I spent much less time reading this second book but this time more light bulbs seemed to come on.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I'm beginning to wonder about all the people who say that they're \\"hardcore AFI fans\\" before trashing this album.<br /><br />I've been a fan since 2002; I was introduced via Black Sails in the Sunset and Art of Drowning. I love Very Proud of Ya, Shut Your Mouth, and Answer That for the punky aspects, I love Black Sails for the raw energy it has, I love Art of Drowning for the exceptional lyrics, I love Sing the Sorrow for the beauty of the music, and I love Decemberunderground because someone finally got the 'modernizing the 80s' sound right.<br /><br />I'm not just an AFI fan, I'm a music fan. If you box yourself into one category (punk, goth, whatever; most of you think labels are stupid anyway), you're going to miss out on a lot of stuff this band has to offer. If you're really that one-dimsenional, where you only like one certain type of music, then you're not going to like AFI. Period. They change as people as life progresses, so their music changes to reflect that. You like their old stuff better? That's great, but don't say you want another Black Sails, or another Very Proud of Ya, or whatever. Bands that can't evolve don't make it. If Davey and the rest of the guys were still singing about not being able to get mohawks or how people don't understand them, you'd hate it, and I'd hate it. That's like Blink 182 still bitching about high school on their last album when they should be going to their high school reunions and taking care of their kids.<br /><br />Miss Murder is definitely catchy, and gets me pumped up like only Days of the Phoenix could do. Prelude 12/21 is beautiful, and really shows that Davey knows how to control his voice to get the sound he wants. The Missing Frame is definitely full of that 80s pop sound I love (you know you like it, too, don't deny it), and Affliction is fun to (try to) scream along to, not to mention the last minute or so of it really shows a different side of AFI. 37mm, musically, reminds me that Davey is into NIN, but is still obviously AFI. Love Like Winter is possibly my favorite song on the album, and I can't wait to see the video for it. The only song I don't love is Kill Caustic, and that's only because I can't scream to sing along with it.<br /><br />So yes. Five stars for Decemberunderground. All you \\"hardcore punks\\" or whatever need to get over yourselves and grow up, because AFI isn't going to slow down and stagnate for your sake.ut is still obviously AFI. Love Like Winter is possibly my favorite song on the album, and I can't wait to see the video for it.

0375759174|5.0|In NORTHANGER ABBEY, Jane Austen satirizes what for her and her late 18th century readers was the Gothic novel. Even before Ann Radcliffe published the enormously popular MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO in 1794, the novel of sentiment was all the rage.  In such stories the heroine was likely to cry, swoon, and moan at the drop of a hat. Radcliffe in her book added the other Gothic ingredients of fear, ghosts, haunted houses, and other paranormal phenomena.  Austen looked down on writers who had their heroines engage in such unseemly behavior even though she was later to treat seriously the same trait of sensibility in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.   <br /> <br />The heroine of NORTHANGER ABBEY is Catherine Morland, who seems unlike what will later prove to be a typical Austen protagonist.  Catherine at the start of the book is much more closely allied to the \\"sense\\" half of the push-pull sense and sensibility dichotomy of all her works.  She is the daughter of a prosperous clergyman who travels to a resort named Bath, where she meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney.  There are the usual romantic plot complications of an Austen novel which normally allow the heroine to be attracted by her male counterpart and encounter suitable obstacles, all of which are neatly resolved after both parties undergo some serious soul searching which in turn leads to a higher level of moral vision. In this case, Austen has great fun with Catherine by first showing her as full of sense, then later shifting gears by morphing her into a standard \\"sensible\\" female of the Gothic genre, finally whirling Catherine back to a position of reason and logic.  It takes half of the book before Austen gets to the Gothic satire for which it is well-known.  When Catherine arrives at Northanger Abbey, she inexplicably is affected by the conventional Gothic trappings of the place.  Where the earlier Catherine would see an occurrence that might have seemed spooky to other more stereotyped Gothic heroines but not so to her, the newer Catherine now could see that same eerie event and be filled with unfounded terror.  It is only now that Austen makes clear the target of her barbed satire.  She was plainly disgusted with other writers who purposefully filled the empty heads of their heroines with Gothic terror, but when she did the same, it was excusable since satire, not stereotype, was her aim. Later, Catherine's grasp of sense returns as she is able to exonerate in her own mind General Tilney from the suspected charge of the murder of his wife.  By the end of the novel, the reader has been introduced to the theme of sense versus sensibility or unstructured emotion versus stifling reason. In Catherine Morland, and later for nearly of all of Austen's female protagonists, Austen suggests that in having to choose between the two extremes, one might seek a middle ground so that each one can complement, rather than supplement the other.  There are simply too many examples of extremes who end badly in Austen's works for one to ignore her implied advice.   <br />

0345423496|1.0|This book was very disappointing given Clarke's other works.  There was little explanation as for how Poole survived, and the book spent most of the time catching him up on the last 1000 years.  I was expecting a big finale, and what I got was a few pages involving using a computer virus to trick the monolith system into giving humanity another 1000 years.  When I got to the last page I thought, \\"that's it?\\"
0451525892|4.0|In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen begins in her first novel what for her was to be her life long concern: what is the proper role that society should take in the relationship between men and women?  In this novel at least, her response is that potential lovers must strike a balance between accepting the limitations upon romance imposed by a society that was ruled by a complex web of social, political, and legal restrictions and rejecting or at least tactfully ignoring those restrictions and thus incurring the wrath of an outraged society that does not easily suffer its laws flouted.  In her later novels, Austen implies that wit may be a leavening agent (as in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) that may succeed where pure sense comes up short or raw emotion may be used (as in PERSUASION) for the same purpose.<br /><br />Unlike in her later novels, Austen divides her heroine into two psychologically different young women. There is Elinor Dashwood, who possesses sense in abundance, and then there is her sister Marianne, who cultivates sensibility. In the context of 18th century English genteel society \\"sense\\" refers not to what we would call today as common sense but the unspoken assumption that single women realize that they do not live in a cultural vacuum. The rules concerning the legal distribution of inherited property, the social rules concerning who may dance with whom at approved balls, and the need to marry \\"upward\\" all interlocked to place a velvet-gloved bear hug on women who had some very real and serious decisions to make concerning marriage if they did not want to end up as the next generation's spinster aunt.  There is Marianne Dashwood, who is more than willing to make such daunting choices not based on the sense that guides her sister but on the trashy and sensational pulp romance novels of the day.  Where Elinor falls in love with Edward Ferrars, a man of honor, if not of the hidden type, she makes her choice based on premises of which society could approve. Where Marianne has an infatuation with the roguish John Willoughby, a man with clear character flaws, she makes her choice based on her own artificially heightened sensibility of dime-store romance books.  The basic thrust of the novel is that both sisters slowly and painfully grow to accept that a life based solely on the one or the other philosophy is unworkable. Austen implies that there is a golden middle, albeit one which probably is more closely allied to sense than to sensibility.<br /><br />In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen limits her view of the often convoluted knots of human relationships into a deceptively smooth and flattened perspective in a manner that would slowly change in her later books to include a more realistic, if not more necessarily complex vision that would allow women and men to interact in a forthright way of which even an entrenched society might approve.  Though SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Austen's most popular book, it clearly shows in a restricted way the limits that her culture placed on the rights of women to call their own shots.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|What a great epic movie, only wish I bought the wide screen instead - wonderful movie.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|This Album is one of the best Thrash albums ever made so don't listen to Virushan he's tone deaf and what he said couldn't be farther from the truth! Some Metal CD's sound muddy and boring the production on this CD is excellent the guitars sound amazing and the vocals are killer. Buy this CD you'll love it!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I came across Supernatural by accident when I was bored one night and turned on the TV. I didn't realize I was watching a WB show until the commercials... WB is usually not my kind of channel as most of its shows are lackluster. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that Supernatural delivered like no other WB show ever has. I'm now looking forward to getting my DVD set and see the whole first season before the second season begins.  <br /> <br />Aside from the fact that each episode is just full of suspense and thrills, the underlying plot is what kept me watching weekly. The family torment, especially that of Sam, is really my draw to this show. Sam's sensitivity and soulfulness has kept me addicted to this show. <br /> <br />The actor portraying Sam (Jared) truly portrays his role perfectly with such emotion that I always felt his sadness, resentment, hatred, and love just by looking through his eyes. His eyes truly reflect Sam's soul, which for me is a sign of a gifted actor. All you had to do was look at his eyes and you would know the pain that Sam was feeling. I can't wait until Sam's special powers are put forth more during the second season and see this character develop even more.  <br /> <br />Providing the comic relief for the show and the family glue is Dean. He is a believable, albeit stereotypical, character who seems to always save the day. The actor portraying him does a good job at being the \\"cool guy\\" with a \\"hidden heart\\". <br /> <br />The chemistry between the two brothers is just wonderful and the producers should be commended for casting them to their roles perfectly. I hope that the dynamic between these two brothers is kept throughout the entire series.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Loved this movie as much as \\"Stroke of Genius\\".  I'm not a golfer, but love good movies.
B0002DKCMG|1.0|This is the dumbest, most predictable, horrible waste of time i've ever ever seen.  This movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn't.  It took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe, drink, and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us.  After watching this movie I felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash.  my only hope is that our european friends didn't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident.
0385474547|4.0|I read this for my English 201 class in college. This is a story about being who you were meant to be, about becoming blind from trying too hard not to be a certain way. Achebe wrote this because there was so much literature representing African people in a misunderstood way, to say the least, so he set out to write a genuine and real tale of the way of life in Africa. It's tough to read at times, there's sad moments. The characters are deep and intriguing. Although they are not perfect, I understand their decisions. It's also about equality, about doing things 100%, and standing up for what you believe in. Aside from being a tale about all these things, there's lots of culture and tradition woven into the lines, and while learning a thing or two about life, you'll also find out interesting facts about the life of the tribe described in the book.
0375703764|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book, but it is not for everyone. If the concept intrigues you, read it. But do it without expectation. <br /> <br />Without repeating what has been said plenty already, there are two things that strike me about this book more than anything else. First is the depth. The book is so complex, it almost feels arrogant to claim I absorbed all the subtle nuances the book has to offer, that I was receptive to everything the author communicated. I feel like I could reread the book a dozen times, each time accepting different assumptions or focusing on a perticular aspect of the story, and get something different from the book. <br /> <br />The second is that, unlike any other book I've read, this one not only drew me into the story but caused me to experience it. The power of this book is that, as I turned it every which way and followed the challenging chaos of footnotes I became disoriented - just as the characters traversing the labrynth become disoriented. Just as they obsessively explored in hopes of making tidy sense out of a space they knew was impossible, I found myself desiring to continue reading the book in hope of finding that gratifying explanation - for closure, for definite answers to my questions - that I knew darn well wouldn't come. <br /> <br />If you like your literature well-defined, if you like your villains corporeal and their motives knowable, then this might not be the story for you. If you like a book that poses questions only you can answer, where you decide what it's trying to tell you, where knowing what stalks you in the shadows isn't as frightening as not knowing what stalks you in the shadows, then this story is for you. <br /> <br />It wouldn't hurt to keep a dictionary close at hand, either.
0071373586|5.0|The book is a real classic, giving great insights into what works in marketing and more importantly what does not work and why it doesn't work.<br /><br />The book is an updated version so most of the examples are very dated.  It is a little amusing to read about companies that are no longer in existance (Pan Am) and products and ads that ran 10 years ago.  However the specific examples are not the important part of this book. The principles are what matters and the authors do a great job of identifying those.<br /><br />It is a very interesting to read about the mistakes of large multi-national companies that should know better.  There is also an interesting chapter on the Catholic church and their reluctance to properly position the church.  Unfortunately, like with most big organizations, they refuse to see the obvious.  And in positioning the obvious is what is so important but so difficult to see.<br /><br />The book is well written, easy to read and has a lot of very useful information.  You would do well to read it every six months to keep the ideas fresh in your mind.<br /><br />One of the best chapters is positioning yourself.  Some very solid advice that will help anyone in their career or life.<br /><br />Well worth reading even though the examples are very dated.
0743454529|5.0|This book is absolutely gut wrenching. You can see both sides of the story with such clarity.I couldn't even imagine going through something like this. I couldn't put the book down and have told everyone I know to read it.
0618477942|5.0|Astonishingly, this book, which appears to cling to the essential comic strip format, is a literary experience of the highest order. Even if it didn't contain lengthy and wholly organic references to Proust, Joyce and others, it would still pack a bookish wallop. The illustrations at all times add value to the text (and vice versa), rendering the overall experience ever so much more than the sum of its parts. Bechdel creates a moody, erotic web of intimacy, and I could not put it down.
0714834491|5.0|Whenever I need to reset my thinking about a particular problem, this is the book I reach for. It is essentially an entire book of prompts to get your mind moving again. I find it an irreplaceable source of inspiration for new ideas. <br /> <br />It is also just fun to open it up, let fall open at a random pages and start reading.
B000E6ESL2|2.0|Didn't enjoy this movie and wouldn't recommend it at all! Too confusing and difficult to untangle the plot lines and figure out which scenario was real and which one was not, except for maybe the beginning and ending. Felt the screenplay tried to be too artsy and during the bulk of the movie to keep the audience guessing as to what was really going on. Ripoff!!
B00005JP7Y|5.0|I expected good things from this movie, and i was completely blown away! Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are spectacular dancers! Channing Tatum is also a feast for the eyes, but we knew that after She's the Man. The movie had a great plot and a beautiful love story. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did and I highly suggest going to see it!
B00013RC8O|1.0|The color and sound was alright but I was rather disappointed in the movie itself.  It was a very short movie with no introduction starting with the movie and it was a race alright but the driver and car were a total disaster in the ending part of the movie.  I would not class this movie as a 1st Class movie by a long ways.  I guess I was expecting a much better auto race than was in the movie.  Maybe others will enjoy it but I felt it was a waste of my money personnally!!!
B00005JGAB|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at it; the #1 most essential punk album of all time. Without this masterpiece, you wouldn't be able to acknowledge punk as a genre of music because it wouldn't be a genre. This album influenced every 70's punk band that would end up being more successful than The Ramones (The Clash and the Sex Pistols).<br /><br />This is a fun, catchy, simple-but-great album. As unfortunate as this gem was ignored and underrated in the 70's, it set the standard. There has never been, as there will never be another punk album quite like this.<br /><br />Yes, you had your proto-punk bands like The Stooges(my personal favorite), MC5, New York Dolls, The who, and The Velvet Underground, but punk was PERFECTED with this album.<br /><br />Also, this showcases some of The Ramones' finest songs; I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend and Judy Is a Punk are my personal favorites; Today Your Love Tomorrow the World, Havana Affair, I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement, Beat on the Brat, Let's Dance, and basically every other track are Ramones classics that will never be forgotten by Ramones fans.
B000FGGE68|2.0|I found this movie to be boring and found myself hoping it would be over soon. I am not a real big sci fi fan, but my husband, who is a HUGE sci fi fan, was pretty disappointed in the movie. It just did not hold my interest.
B000009HF2|2.0|This is not that great. I grew up in the 1970s and alway thought it was over rated. You know why this album got big, b/c the casual music fans (especially girls) that were really not into buying albums...this was their live album. They never knew about classic live albums w/energy like Deep Purple \\"made in japan\\", LEd Zep \\"song remains the same\\", Stones \\"get your ya yas out\\", Who \\"live at Leeds\\", Thin Lizzy \\"live and dangerous\\" and every 70's artist that released the obligatory double live album, they didn't know about these classic works.<br /><br />Frampton's music is decent (\\"Do you feel like we do\\" is great!) but the other material is not that great.<br /><br />You make think I am wrong but maybe that is why Frampton came quickly and tne went just as quickly. He was a corporate pushed fad!<br /><br />Frampton was always a quality guitar slinger, legit artist but this just is not that great of a live album. Does anybody really listen to this from start to finish?
B000E41MS6|5.0|Whether you're an old fan or a new one, you're in for a treat.  The show's been on since the 60's but don't let 40 years of past episodes scare you away, everything is explained. The new series is fast-paced with great production values and snappy dialogue.  Doctor Who is part space adventure, costume drama, and soap opera - so there's something to interest everybody.  There are even a few teary moments in this, something that doesn't happen so often in science fiction.<br /><br />Once you've devoured 2005, never fear - things get even better in 2006.
B000063V8S|4.0|A lot of good episodes in this season. I'm not too crazy about some (Night Terrors and Identify Crisis) but nothing is perfect.  All in all, I like it.

B00065MDRW|3.0|21st Century Schizoid Man is easily one of King Crimson's best songs. It blends perfectly the elements of rock, progressive music, and even jazz (just listen to that drummer) in a format that is actually fun to listen to. Unlike the rest of the album, the exciting presentation and lack of synthesizers makes for a shockingly modern sound. This music is contemporary to Yes or Genesis, but sounds as recent as the Mars Volta. This song gets five stars and honors for one of the best rock songs ever.    The rest of the album is pretty forgettable prog-rock, attempting to be dramatic or intelligent but merely sounding cheesey. Given, I'm not naturally inclined to dislike expansive or avant-garde music, but nothing on this disc impresses me in that regard. There are some nice melodies and intsrumentations of course - these are talented musicians - but nothing plays as inspired as the opening track. They do, however, manage a better job of the more experimental stuff on later releases.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Ever since its release date, this CD didn't leave my car...my old car. Car got totaled and I lost the CD, but fortunately I always make COPIES so I didn't have to kill myself.<br /><br />It's like a party in your car, destined to keep you alert and awake if you're tired.  Neverending music (really, because there's none of that annoying \\"space\\" between tracks...it just keeps flowing).<br /><br />My favorites are Hung Up, Sorry (\\"there's more important things than hearing you speak\\"), Jump (\\"i can make it alone\\"), and How High (\\"it's funny, how everybody mentions my name, but they're never really nice\\").  Well, I never get tired of ANY of the songs, not even Hung Up.<br /><br />The bonus track isn't too great though...I like the track offered by ICON much better, Super Pop. It's kind of silly, but it's clever:<br /><br />\\"If I was an animal I'd be a dog<br />If I was a dog I would be a man<br />If I was a man I'd be the president<br />If I was a president I'd be different...\\"<br /><br />And I wasn't too surprised that she'd want to be painter Frida Kahlo and hero Martin Luther.<br /><br />I wasn't overly impressed with some parts of the special edition. The photo booklet had the same photos as the regular album and I thought she would have actually had short journal entries instead of just song lyrics in the journal. But anyway, the ICON membership for 1 month was cool..I ended up joining for a year.<br /><br />In closing, the song Like it or Not is the ultimate Madonna anthem - \\"This is who I am, you can like it or not, you can love me or leave me 'cuz I'm never gonna stop...\\"  Madonna, you'll never stop, don't worry. I just wish I could meet you.
0393327655|5.0|Mr. Harris has done us an immense favor with this brilliant book. Unfortunately those who would benefit the most from this favor are highly unlikely to read it. The very basic nature here is that the belief in the supernatural, no matter what sect, denomination, or ideology, is fundamentally harmful to the individual and to society.  <br /> <br />It should be noted that this is NOT saying that a sense of spirituality is harmful, only that the idea that spirituality comes from some external, mystical, otherworldly, source. All religion (as opposed to all Religions) is necessarily a precursory to bigotry, bias, and violence.  <br /> <br />I think that I understand the desire that belief in the supernatural should be true, but I have never understood the actual belief itself. To believe in some strange force, or being, or `other' out there is, and always has been, to me outrageously irrational. <br /> <br />If you are looking at this review and this book you are probably either already predisposed to buy it and say, as I do, \\"Good! This needed saying,\\" or to say as many others have, \\"This is trash and heresy and blasphemy and Sam Harris needs a whipping.\\" It is unlikely that you are in the middle somewhere and that is all the more a pity because that is who should be reading this book.
B0002O7XVI|4.0|I was surprised how similar much of the script and scenes were to the 1998 A&E adaptation, which I saw 6 years before this one....the hand scene, for example (\\"Which are my hands, and which are yours?\\" --\\"They're all yours\\").  The scenes in the carriage alone with Alec, the somewhat disturbing strawberry scene, the scenes with Angel carrying Tess and the other 3 girls across the flooded path, among others.<br /><br />It always breaks my heart to see Tess' baby denied a Christian burial.<br /><br />Interestingly, the actress that plays Mrs. Durbeyfield in the A&E version plays Mrs. D'Urberville/Stokes' henhouse servant in Polanski's.  Instead of wearing a gorgeous blue dress in the final scenes, Tess wears a gorgeous red and black dress here.<br /><br />Still good, but seemed to drag a little more. Also, Angel asks Izz (Isabel?) to run off with him to Brazil in this version. I thought it made his character seem even more despicable, though in the end he left without her.<br /><br />In my shallow opinion, Oliver Milburne is more attractive as Angel, and Justine Waddell far outshines Kinski.
1932100660|5.0|This book gives quite a convincing argument against the commonly held views of what a healthy diet consists of.  Realizing the stronghold of the meat and dairy industries in mass media, industry, and medicine, our Western culture has been indoctrinated into believing a set of nutritional ideals that, as Bill O'Reilly would say, \\"are not looking out for you\\".  This book is a good review of different disease entities  that are common to the Western worlds, referred to as diseases of affluence. It is striking to realize that despite our wealth, our healthcare system, and our education, the United States is grossly inflicted with these diseases that are rarely seen in poorer, rural countries that have a much different diet.  Next, the book outlines eight specific principles to eating right so to obtain maximal health.  The myths of vitamin supplements are exposed as is the commonly held notion that genetics play the major role in disease pathogenesis.  Lastly, the author asks the most important question, \\"Why Haven't You Heard This Before?\\"  He exposes the \\"dark sides\\" of science, industry, government, and medicine, that has led to the propogation of false, misleading, or simply confusing information.  It is a very interesting, well-researched book that should be read by anyone interested in maximizing health, preventing disease, slowing the disease process, and understanding the truth behind some of the modern day medical and nutritional scams.

B000000OAL|5.0|For a select few bands their self-titled album effort is one which becomes a smash hit and even changes the landscape of music.  Queen is not one of them, whose eponymous debut was this gem that was so invisible it's lead single, \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", did not even chart.   <br /> <br />   Almost anyone who takes the time to listen to this album will likely be familiar with a substantial portion of Queen's catalogue and looking at the tracks with that benefit proves to be a stunning look into the roots of what would become one of rock's most popular and accomplished bands of all time.  Nowhere near as diverse in styles as some of the later albums like A Night At The Opera or Day At The Races, most of the tracks on Queen fall into the hard-rock category, but is within those individual tracks that all of the roots are found.  Soaring, heavy guitar riffs from May(\\"Keep Yourself Alive\\"), immense and powerful vocals from Mercury(\\"Liar\\", \\"Jesus\\"), lengthy, complex compositions that frequently shift in style(\\"Great King Rat\\"), and the just plain bizarre(\\"My Fairy King\\").   <br /> <br />   Retrospective perceptions aside, the tracks here are quality songs in their own right, with catchy hooks, provacative lyrics and (of course) sublime vocals by the incomparable Freddie Mercury. <br /> <br />   I highly recommend \\"Queen\\" to any fan who already owns a few albums and is looking to expand their catalogue.  New fans looking to start their collections should look elsewhere to \\"A Night At The Opera\\" or \\"News of the World\\".
B00005JMXX|5.0|Even though this movie is fictional, it makes you wonder what could potentially happen if there would ever be sudden and/or drastic changes to the atmosphere, our water levels and temperatures, etc.  This also shows how we can pull together and work together no matter who we are.
B00004IA0K|5.0|I'd like to review the reviewer. One of the greatest albums ever written, performed by some of the most talented musicians ever to grace our planet .... and all he could muster was: \\" The Chili Peppers and their box set rocks. Need I say more\\"?! Well yes, I think so... if you are going to review an album! Because that's why these reviews are written. To allow those who don't know the album to get an idea of what it's like. Or is it just another excuse to Blogg your name in ? If you don't have it you need it. It's absolutely outstanding every track and one of the defining albums of our time.
B000GCFO08|5.0|As for the statement saying this is a highly profeminist and christian movie... that has got to be the most unitelligent comment ive ever read. Don't let nonsense like that turn you off!! <br /> <br />As many reviews will tell you - this movie is only fully appreciated by the Silent Hill players. I personally only played Silent Hill 4 for a few days and still loved this movie. I even went back for a second time while it was in theatres. <br />The entire movie's got this atmosphere to it that's haunting -but also very visually stunning and appealing. Call it.. morbid beauty. But aside from that, the acting is great, and the plot plays out with a sense of mystery that leaves you to use your head (that might turn off some people?)  <br />One thing that I like about the Silent Hill movie is that the horror isnt based around killing or gore. Its a kindof horror that leaves you thinking \\"What the...?\\" or something along those lines. For any fans of a good, thrilling, dark, scary movie - you'll love this one!! BUY IT!!
B0000009SM|5.0|...and that's saying something. Before I get into my review, I just wanna say \\"Thank You!\\", to all of you readers out there. Any newcomers who are interesting enough to open this page, thanks! It's good to see that there are still plenty of people in the world who love the work of Frank Zappa. Through his six-volume \\"You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore\\" releases to his countless post-humous albums, the man's done it all, but this takes the cake. Along with some other works around this time, \\"One Size Fits All\\" is an absolutely essential Zappa tape that should be one of the first in this genius's world of music that should be added to your collection. <br />     How to pull off a feat of making the best of a 60+ discography? Simple. Write some great lyrics, work on some impossible songwriting textures, techniques and tempo changes and hire a virtuoso musician that adds up to almost every popular instrument known to man. <br />     If I'm exaggerating, I apologize, but stating this album for what it's worth, well then: It's worth the price and then some! In only nine tracks, Zappa and the Mothers of Invention (though this is the last title to include), they pull off a flurry of genres that, when combined together in the right way, makes a leviathan of an album! You have the jazzy, 9-minute opener \\"Inca Roads\\", for example. This is one of my favorite Zappa tracks, and included are some impossibly fast marimba/flute work, funny lyrics and a 2-minute plus guitar solo from the man himself! Actually, I love the solo here, not only because it shows how talented Frank Zappa was, but it's memorable, almost to a lusty extent if I may be so bold. I can't get enough of this track, and neither will you if you're looking for some classic Zappa. <br />     \\"Can't Afford No Shoes\\" is a pretty basic, amusing and straight-ahead rock track with a great guitar/drum/piano combo and lyrics that will make you laugh. Both the \\"Sofas\\" are jazzy and romantic; the second one includes lyrics inGerman, which makes sense, considering Frank Zappa is German. However, I must admit I like Sofa No. 1 a bit more. <br />     Even though I normally give a track-for-track review of most of the albums I review, and I've left you hanging to see how some of the other songs are, I think I'll just let you find out for youself. After all, there's nothing wrong with a surprise, and it's important to get the heads-up on songs like these for yourself. But if you wanna get into Zappa, this is a positive MUST-BUY. <br />     Overall: A few words to describe this album: Epic, Fantastic, Timeless, Romantic, Lyrically Witty, Instrumentally Dazzling, and  at the top of the Zappa tapes (I refer to Frank's work as \\"the Zappa tapes\\" with my guitar teacher sometimes). To speak in a direct way, I, like many other Zappa fans, consider this to be one of the greatest Frank Zappa albums you're gonna get. So, if you are interested in a number of music genres, are looking for something that's not your typical rock album, or just want to discover the magic and the genius that is Frank Zappa, add this to your list and I hope you'll love it. I know I did!
0312995423|1.0|Because I enjoyed Brown's other novels so much, I was thouroughly disapointed with this one.  The characters are pathetically uninteresting.  Knowing Brown's other work, I assumed the book would start to pick up and get better, but I ultimately gave up by chapter 8.  It's just distinctly disapointing and I highly recommend reading any of Brown's novels except this one.
B000063DFN|5.0|Powerslave...even the name sounds legendary. Over the years, trends may have come and gone, but Iron Maiden has stood strong through it all. Even today, though they're not so mainstream, you can still see their t-shirts worn on strangers in a crowd (featuring of course, the immortal Eddie The Mascot!) <br />If you've never heard any of Maiden's music, they sound a bit like other famous, founding power-metal bands Judas Priest and Dio. I know nobody's compared Maiden to Dio much, but I believe that Maiden, Priest and Dio were all founders of the heavy metal sub-genre known as \\"power metal\\", which, if defines, includes melodic, chugging guitars, deep basses, fast, heavy drumming and soaring vocals. <br />However, these three were different than some of the great, yet unfortunately faceless European power-metal acts. The three power-metal titans were all somewhat mainstream so they had a bit of a different sound. Still, Iron Maiden was a revolutionary band that deserves respect and attention, and \\"Powerslave\\" is certainly one of their best, along with being one of the finest metal albums ever to grace our music stores! <br />Believe it or not, this was actually my first Iron Maiden cd...not \\"Piece of Mind\\", nor \\"Number\\". I know what you're thinking - 'what's up with that?'. Well, while online, I heard a sample of the epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". I put everything I was doing on hold and felt this epic masterpiece flow through my body! It rocked! So in a few days, I picked this work of art up and can't stop listening to it. Here are the pieces that form this creation. <br />Aces High: LOVE the opening. So melodic, yet so catchy, one of my favorite tracks. Then it starts up with a fast pace and some great vocal/instrumental work. Actually, this is a song about warplanes, bombers and things of that sort. Very interesting and a dazzling opener. Kind of like Judas Priest's \\"Rapid Fire\\", off the album \\"British Steel\\" (another fine example of power-metal!) <br />2 Minutes To Midnight: Catchy, sing-a-long chorus with a killer guitar riff that sounds similar to the one on the classic Dio track \\"Stand Up and Shout\\". <br />Losfer Words (Big 'Orra): An instrumental, and a flawless one at that. Seems to go by quickly, but never loses its greatness. <br />Flash of the Blade: A mostly instrumental one with a super guitar riff. Included is a fancy, even neo-classical lick in here with a start-stop bass/drums combo similar to the opening of \\"Aces High\\". <br />The Duelists: A similar topic to \\"Flash of the Blade\\", but longer and with more lyrics. Starts off with a quick beat of the drum and doesn't stop from there! <br />Back in the Village: Would be considered perfect if not for the last, twenty seconds! If you're gonna listen to this CD late at night, don't listen to this track. Towards the end, the music goes on and on until you hear these creepy, pre-recorded types of sound effects, something very similar to what Pink Floyd does. Still, I admire the whole technique and how they put it in without doing it the wrong way. <br />Powerslave: The Egyptian-tinged title track that's one of the longest songs on the album. The really catchy part of this is when a verse on the chorus repeats, \\"Tell me why I had to be a powerslave!\\". I've STILL got it in my head from the first time I listened to it. <br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner: Worth the entire cost of the album alone! A thirteen and a half minute epic that's got anything and everything! Starts off pretty quickly, but towards the middle it slows down and even has the Captain (read the lyrics and you'll understand what I mean), narrating a part. Actually, the whole epic is, as another reviewer mentioned, about a captain and his crew out at sea. They shoot down an albatross, possibly for food, and some unexpected things happen. You absolutely MUST listen to this song! <br /> <br />Overall: This is a fine slab of history that seems to be forgotten with today's music audience, and that's a shame.If more people today were able to recognize the talent and greatness of bands past, like Iron Maiden, among countless other classics, the world would be a little better. Even if this seems to be overlooked, it's definitely a Top 10 Metal Album. I had my doubts while buying it, but now, I can't stop listening to it! So, buy yourself a little piece of history and know you've got a timeless classic in your collection!
0618526412|4.0|The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a strange book. It is classic Southern Gothic, and it is with a heavy heart that you read on, page after page.<br /><br />The story takes place around the beginnings of World War II in a small Georgia town. The main characters are the deaf mute Mr. Singer, and the four people who all befriends him, because in him they have found a person who will listen to them.<br /><br />There is the young girl Mick, who has so much music in her head and who dreams of writing a symphony and move to a place where it snows. There is the caf&eacute;-owner Biff, whose wife recently died and left him alone with the caf&eacute; and his thoughts and newspapers. And there is the leftwing activist Jake Blount and the black doctor mr. Benedict. All four of them visits Mr. Singer, and tells him about their thoughts and dreams. Whatever Mr. Singer thinks about them, we are never told. Mr. Singer only dreams of his sick friend, who was taken away from him and put in a home.<br /><br />There is no real plot in this story, and it moves slowly along. It is even boring at some points, but on every page you can feel the loneliness and some of the despair the characters feel, and that makes this story hard to forget.
1400032717|2.0|This story about an autistic teenage boy on its own is quite a good story, though it is quite short.  I read it in about six hours.  The main reason I did not like the book was because it felt like the author had to drop the F-bomb cuss word every page and it just ruined the story.  Maybe once would be acceptable.  But in every conversation?  Not everyone in the world uses that language, as the story seems to portray.  By the end of the book, I was left wondering if I got the right book.  I didn't understand what the hype was all about.  I would not recommend this book to anyone that does not like a lot of profanity in their reading, like me.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I am a fan of the Silent Hill games. <br /> <br />I read nothing but negative critics about this movie and I thought it might be a bad one... until I saw it. This one is an outstanding work. The story is unique and brilliant, as well as the acting, even the smallest parts are played by very talented actors. The director took care of all the details to make a perfect and scary movie about Silent Hill. Amazing. Can't wait to get the R2 version.
B000E1JOSE|1.0|This has nothing to due with Roy or the songs on this CD. This is a great Disc except for one thing. Sony is still playing games with copy protection. THIS HAS IT. My computer picked it up real fast. Orbison Records needs to be careful who they partner with. By the way this is the worst score I have given on this site.
0807014265|5.0|I purchased \\"Mans Search for meaning\\" because Amazon suggested it after I read \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel. I began to read it, and at first it seemed quite a bit like \\"Night\\" (which was a terrific book may I mention). As you read on after his story of being in the Concentration Camp, he begins to talk about how he was able to handle being in the position in which he was. This is when the book begins to hit you differently! It feels like he is talking directly to you. Trying to help guide you in a better direction than what your life may be leading. It makes you want to be and do better! I believe everyone gets something different and the same from \\"Man Search for Meaning\\". It helped me, I now feel like my life is going in the right direction, thanks to Viktor E Frankl. I highly recommend this book! Make time to read it, there's so much power in such a small book.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I agree with the sentiment that you can't just watch this movie once. The first time I saw it, I was with a couple of friends, and we weren't getting it at all, but we were having fun trying to figure out who was whom according to the characters in the \\"Philosophy of Time Travel\\".    Art can be interpreted so many ways, and we all have our own opinions. Nobody can be \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" in what they appreciate, which is one of the beauties of Art in itself. To me, Donnie Darko is like one of those paintings a person needs to stare at for a substantial amount of time before they see the beauty of the picture. Once you learn who the characters are in the film....what the Artifact is, the role of the Manipulated Dead/Living, and so on, it becomes a whole different movie, and it's quite a film after that. 4 stars is fair, to me, but I understand those that give it 5.
B000006IUQ|5.0|This is a great movie. I have seen it over and over and still feel amused. Just Great!
B000FOQ0TG|5.0|OMCII is just plain great. It is not just like the first but has melodies and beats that have been updated since \\"6500 days\\" to show how much they have grown as a band and how far they have come. Vocals are amazing, music is perfect, tight and you feel the musicians love of playing. The story captures you and carries you through Nikki's life and experiences after he is released from jail. You feel the intense emotion Geoff is trying to portray. The pain and suffering Nikki is going through is apparent in the songs. They never try to be like they were, and they shouldn't, even though alot of people always compare anything new they do to operation mindcrime and empire. Their love of just playing and creating means more to the people that appreciate them than how many cd's they've sold. Hearing DIO on this is one of the coolest things I've heard and just shows how great of a band Queensryche is.
0792846443|4.0|Rob Reiner's 1990 adaption of Stephen King's Misery is a film that works for various reasons, a few of which I will touch on here. The most obvious reason is of course the Oscar winning performance of Kathy Bates, as nut job Annie Wilkes. Playing a dangerous psycho as opposed to just another straight person is already the actors equivalent of being a peacock in a room full of pigeons, but it is all the more stricking here because both Kathy Bates and Rob Reiner are entirely on the same page, that is to say, they both seem to understand precisely what makes Annie Wilkes tick, and what makes the movie tick for that matter. You can look at this movie as simply the story of a misfortunate man at the mercy of a monster, who in the end, must truimph over this monster by killing it, or you could see it in a more darkly subversive light. <br />      The darker subversive light to this story, is to see it as a tragic love affair. It can be seen as a story in which a delusional person ( Annie Wilkes ) thinks that the object of her desire is something more then an ordinary man, so she built him into a God that should be placed on an alter, high on a pedestal. Just like some kind of childlike innocent, her admiration of him is of the most idealistic variety, and seems to be platonic and almsot spiritually based. She spends most of the film wallowing in a sort of self made torment of keeping her love object at arms lenth, where instead of culminating her true bodily cravings, she instead idolizes and worships her object while living forever in her own little fantasy dream world that has no place for such lewd lascivious base hungers. The problem here is that these types of feelings are what normally hits a young shy teen boy durring his first ever crush, not a grown woman facing middle age. Every action Annie Wilkes takes is to abstain from the unavoidable culmination of their eventual coitus, thus when the act of sex finally happens, it is explosive, volatile, and violent, it shatters her delusional bubble. The subversive sex act itself involves blood, fire, biting, beating, the climactic firing of her viral maleness, and some extremely raunchy sex talk, in fact, it is the first time Annie Wilkes uses real adult language rather then her amusing \\"Cock-a-doo-dee\\" speak. Not to be outdone by Annie Wilkes sudden sexually charged emergence, Paul Sheldon ( James Caan ), her love object shoves burning paper into her mouth and yells the movies most memorable line \\" HERE YOU WANT IT?! EAT IT!! EAT IT TILL YOU CHOKE YOU SICK TWISTED.....!\\" Yes, the sex talk gets down right dirty and full of imaginative urgent energy. The action finally ends with the two of them lying side by side on the hard wood floor, a hitherto never before seen look of fullfillment etched on her burnt and bloody face, while her love object pants from all the exertion spent to quell this passionate violent act, it would seem that the only thing missing is that they are not smoking cigarettes.  <br />      Since sex is arguably the main reason we are alive, and is possibly what holds the candle to our very creative energy, it is hard not to see this film play out in this more subversive way. I feel that both Kathy Bates and Rob Reiner captured this aspect of both Annie Wilkes and the film perfectly and deliberately. On a sidenote, I think Annie Wilkes is the male in this twisted realationship, capable of giving her object a nice firemans carry with sturdy vigor. <br />        The others aspect of this film to point out is the concise stream-lined direction by Rob Reiner which makes viewing this film such a pleasure. Each scene is just the right size and has just the right amount of spice to keep things moving, seemingly without effort. Maybe I am becoming old and refined in my ways, but I can't stress enough the importance of not overdoing something, and keeping things singular and simplistic in nature. The bad aspect is that once again writer Stephen King has taken an existing movie, in this case its \\"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane\\" 1962, and passed it off as his own inspired ideas. His plagiarizing continued with other such works as TommyKnockers, ( Five Million Years to Earth 1968 ) and Christine, ( The Car 1977 ) , but its hardly a knock on Misery, which holds its own very nicely thanks to aspects that were picked out in the acting and directing. <br />     Misery is a good bit of entertainment to keep in your collection, and a very affordable and abundant movie to find, at least untill they release a 20th anniversary addition or something, full of extras the current release does not have.
B000FP2Z0S|2.0|Being a fan of siren song of the counter culture(which was an amazing cd.)  I am hard pressed to give them a good rating.  But since I put in this cd, I haven't heard the angst or passion from their previous albums.  It sounds like the took out all the angst and tried to sound as hard as they could, but it didn't work.  This cd was surprisingly lame and there were no standouts.
B000EULJLU|1.0|First, I acknowledge that Tool is the best band in the world. That just makes this CD that much more disappointing.<br /><br />There are 2 half decent songs on this CD, the rest is annoying, nonsensical, repetitious, grating noise. This CD is almost entirely lacking any melodies. There's actually a \\"song\\" of indian chanting! I am at a loss to describe this CD any further. What a waste of time.<br /><br />Listening to this CD actually made me angry.
B000A6T262|5.0|The Features and interviews give it all up ,I only thought I knew it all.I'm 54
B000EHSVQE|1.0|I heard all these awesome things about this movie, but honestly, it has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Not one memorable line, scene, character or idea.  If I could only get that 86 minutes of my life back.
B00006GA48|4.0|Hey <br />   I have been looking for this album for the last 20 years. <br />Whenever radio stations played the title song i could never <br />catch the name of the album. Absolutely no regrets.It felt <br />Like i was a kid again and thanks to Amason i now own a copy. <br />For classic rock lovers this is a very good addition to any <br />collection.                               <br />                                      hope you enjoy it!
068484267X|5.0|After I retired from teaching, I was at Borders, looking for something good to read.  Angela's Ashes caught my eye, so I picked it up and began the first page.  Needless to say, I didn't have to look further.  Once I got in my car and drove home, I went in the house, sat down, and began once more to pore over its pages.  I tell ye what, me little darlins, I couldn't put this'n down til' it was finished.  I was completely stricken with the sadness of poor little Frankie's life in Limerick, Ireland, and even to this day I find myself still mulling over and over in my mind, the Irish dialect within its pages. <br /> <br />Afterwards, I practically begged others to read it, knowing they would no doubt have the same reaction.  Not so.  I even loaned my precious copy to a dear friend.  A few days later, she handed it back, saying, \\"I just couldn't read it.  I found it to be much too depressing.\\"  I couldn't believe anyone would refuse to read such a fine piece of literature, all because they found it to be a bit gloomy.  Life isn't always sunshine and roses.  We should familiarize ourselves with the reality of hardship such as Frank McCourt's heartbreaking childhood.  I, too, faced difficult times during my own Appalachian boyhood in the 1940s-'50s; however, Frank McCourt made me feel as if I had been raised by royalty in comparison to his seemingly hopeless existence in Limerick.  Later, I loaned it to another friend.  She told me, \\"I stopped reading it.  He got too personal in his writing.\\"  I thought, \\"What's wrong with these people anyway?\\"   <br /> <br />To this day, I'm still seeking others who will read this book and find the same level of entertainment I felt when I first held it in my hands.   <br /> <br />From the hills of West Virginia, I am... <br /> <br />David Lee Thompson, Author <br />River of Memories:  An Appalachian Boyhood
B000G759LW|5.0|As a 38yo man, I have always been impressed with Christina's vocal talent more than her actions to impress her teenage fans. She has a God given talent that few other singers have. I don't believe a single member of the Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, 98' degrees, any rapper and especially not that marketed female known as Britney, have any real talent that will give them success when they're 30, 40, & 50. Christina on the other hand is the exception. Back to Basics shows that talent and it also shows she is more mature than any of her competition. For her to give nods to the music of the 40's, 50's & 60's shows she has class too. This CD is 100% 5 stars. Buy this cd today!
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones what can i say? Greatest band ever? Maybe not but pretty darn close.For all those to stuck up to like the ramones because the poor production and lack of fast guitar solos are really missing. The Ramones were born on 50's bubblegum and the new york dolls the stones and beatles. If you are new to The ramones i recommend not starting with this album because you might be turned off cause lack of audio quality. Try A greatest hits or Rocket to russia, road to ruin, End Of the Century, Brain drain, or pleasant dreams. The Ramones debut is a great great album really what rock n roll should be about not 30 minute drum solos.
0141301066|4.0|My son loves Roald Dahl books and I know that some of the content is inappropriate for a 6 year old but he seems to really connect with Roald Dahl's writing.  He read Matilda tonight before going to bed and around 10:00pm came into the living room balling his eyes out.  He couldn't understand how Matilda would want to leave her parents or why her parents would not even look back as they were leaving forever.  It took over an hour to console our child and I regret not reading the book myself first.  I understand that great books do exactly what Matilda did to my child but use caution with younger kids, I only wish someone would have posted a review similar to mine and I would have never bought Matilda for my son.  While I'm here, he read Holes and was very upset by the child abuse portrayed in that book as well, again, just a warning.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Simply excellent,i have watched this movie many times and its been very emotional every time,every movie collector has to have this in their collections.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|This CD as a number of good songs on it with the most notable being miss murder..
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm another relative newcomer to the 'verse; I started watching old episodes of Firefly on the Sci-Fi Channel. I'm not particularly a fan of most science fiction, but I had heard too many good things about this sadly-cancelled series, and when I finally saw it, I was hooked from the very first episode I saw (which was , for the record, \\"War Stories.\\") This series is so imagnative and cleverly written, yet it retains an essential earthiness that draws me into the story. Excellent. Just excellent.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|This is album is amazing. I can't say it's my favorite Muse CD-- they're all mind-blowing, it'd be impossible to choose, but I listened to this album at least fifteen times the first two days I had it-- no hyperbole. \\"Starlight\\" is perhaps one of my all time favorite songs, and the whole CD is loaded with different styles of music with a Muse twist. I almost want to say that this album is like a trip back in time, experimenting with different styles of rock-- including Italian Folk??? Sounds weird, but this album must be purchased.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I think that this is one of the best movies of the 80's.  The dance sequences alone are worth seeing the film.  However, I think the story is also a good one.   <br /> <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|It`s 12 years since I saw them in Oslo , but this DVD brings it all back . <br />Pink Floyd is just the best , the hole show , the  mix of lights , videos and the music . <br />Buy it and enjoy it :)
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Watching my newly purchased DVD of Once Upon A Time..., I was struck with the sincere realization that I wished I had never seen this film before.  Having only seen it on VHS, in full screen (shudder!), I never really knew what the difference a clear, crisp print and letterbox formatting could make (not to mention trailers and interviews galore).  I wish that the DVD viewing could have been my first viewing.  For those who have already seen the film, the DVD is second only to seeing it in a theatre, and for those who have never seen it, I envy you your first time!  <br />Onto the film itself, unfortunately I can't say much without ruining it.  However, don't read the back of the DVD case, as it gives away too much.  I will say that I have always been a traditionalist when it comes to Westerns.  I like movies about big, strong men, who wake up ready to shoot down the bad guy and save the woman all in time to stop the Indians from making a suprise attack.  However, Sergio Leone, the film's director, looks at the American wild west with the eye of an outsider, and makes a truly iconic statement about a lost way of life.  Once upon... takes place during the closing of the western frontier on the late 1800's, as new towns, railways, and people are finding their places in a once lawless and free society.  Three men, (Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, Charles Bronson) while fighting against each other, fight collectivley to preserve the way of life they created when they were young, the way of life we see in the westerns with the big, strong men who save the day.  Caught in the middle of the generation gap lovely, tormented Claudia Cardinale is, as the tagline indcates loved, protected, and threatened by each.   <br />Fonda is pure evil, Robards is wrongly accused, Bronson is mysteriously quiet, Cardinale is hiding from her past, and none of them are terribly heroic.  It makes for a heartbreaking example of struggle to accomidate the imes. <br />
B000005HLV|5.0|Mayhem's \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\" is the most creepy, errie, and confusing album that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. For all those that have heard the stories of Murder, Suicide, and Church Burnings surrounding the band, yes its true. If you look past all the BS you will hear and extremly wonderful piece of art. The songs lyrics are almost poetic, and the music, as complicated as it may be (there are no  refrains or breaks, the songs just continue to spit out chunks of lava)is a pleaure to listen to. Even though I am not the biggest Black Metal fan, Mayhem are the gods, as far as I am concerned, even better then Darkthrone, who I thought was top notch, and then to listen to this album, man!!! I cant suggest this album enough to fans of black metal, but if you are new to black metal, this is a great place to start.
B00005JOYM|5.0|World Trade Center is an excellent movie, showing how Americans came together that fateful September 11.

0375831002|2.0|I found this book to be incredibly boring, one of the few books that I've stopped reading before the end. The narrative doesn't flow. The prose would appeal to young children perhaps, but the story is meant to be for adults.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Mike Patton (i.e. the greatest musical genious of our generation) absolutley astounds us with this beautiful compilation of awesome sounds, original melodies and incredible (and distinctly crazy) vocals- not to mention his lyrics. It surprises me that he has come out with something so distinct and original, even parting off from the majority of his other works. In one word- ART.
B00000811N|4.0|Not for the faint-hearted listener, this 1970 soundtrack album to a medical documentary entitled \\"The Body\\" was created by avant-garde composer Ron Geesin & Pink Floyd bassist/singer/composer Roger Waters (Geesin & Waters would work together again on Pink Floyd's \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\" but \\"Music From The Body\\" was their first joint project). The album is pretty wild stuff to say the least, with lots of experimental sounds, instrumentation, vocals and effects. The wonderfully goofy opening cut, \\"Our Song,\\" with it's rhythmic sound collage of clapping, belching, farting and baby noises (accompanied by ragtime piano, no less!), pretty much prepares you for what will follow. But in between Geesin's far-out pieces (other highlights include the vocal experiments of \\"More Than Seven Dwarfs...\\", the spooky \\"Body Transport,\\" and the fun \\"Mrs. Throat Goes Walking\\"), Roger Waters drops in to play some very nice, simple acoustic numbers, like \\"Sea Shell And Stone,\\" \\"Chain Of Life,\\" and \\"Breathe\\" (a very different song from the \\"Breathe\\" that appeared later on Floyd's classic \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" although it shares the same opening lyric: \\"Breathe in the air\\"). Finally, the rest of Pink Floyd themselves---David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright---join Waters at the album's end for the uplifting finale, \\"Give Birth To A Smile.\\" \\"Music From The Body\\" is definitely not an album to play at a party, but if you're a diehard fan of early Pink Floyd, then I think you'll enjoy this weird, wonderful record from Ron Geesin & Roger Waters.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|first off, i'm a fan.  admittedly not as big a fan as i once was - it's a far cry from the halcyon days of music for the masses/ violator - but a fan nonetheless.  all of which makes this painful to write.<br /><br />a lot of people have dubbed this a return to form, a comment which does an extreme disservice to 'exciter'.  despite featuring one of the most toe-curlingly embarrassing moments of dm's history ('dead of night' - shudder - a song so bad it wouldn't have even got onto 'ultra') for all it's flaws it managed to hold the attention.<br /><br />this album tries to maintain a similar laidback, low key vibe to the likes of the excellent 'comatose', 'i feel loved'.  the problem with 'playing the angel' is that the tunes are somewhat...tepid.  there's very little in the way of instant tunes, and crucially it seems to be lacking in growers too.  where dm try to write a song that harks back to the glory days, they're let down by a lack of, for want of a better word, a hook.  best example of this is 'the sinner in me' which, after initial promise, limps to a chorus that falls flat in spectacular (or unspectacular, to be precise) fashion.  'precious' comes off as a poor man's 'enjoy the silence' and 'microcosm' and 'damaged people' are just, well, awful.  the rest just feel somehow half-hearted.<br /><br />it's not all bad.  'i want it all' and 'nothing's impossible' WORK, and 'the darkest star' gets points for trying.  despite this i can't help but feel there's an alan wilder shaped hole in the procedings
B000FS9FCG|5.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is one of a few films in recent memory that transcends its current socio-political environs and reaches across the vast expanse of historical precedent, social experience and collective conscience. Precious few works of art in our post-modern era of self-aggrandizement have accomplished such feats with such ease. We are presented with warnings of ghosts past, portends of an ominous future and lessons to be learned once again by our increasingly complacent populace. <br /> <br />To look at this film and its cogent sense of perspective, one must verily understand its reference to historical periods, though often lauded, present us with a multitude of lessons to remember. The fall of the Roman republic, the Inquisitions, religious zealotry and its brethren political arms, McCarthyism, the reactionary fascism of the 20th century culminating with the death of millions, leading to a climax of our current climate of religious fundamentalism, the subversion of individual rights, freedoms and free will to the grander view of the state. <br /> <br />Individually, the film has deftly used symbols, referenced symbols and discussed symbolism to achieve its aim. Symbols are both powerful subservise agents as well as liberating ones. Subtle and not so subtle references to the idolatry of the Third Reich, the mind numbing rallies and heils of the rallies at Nuremberg, the talking heads of our current media machine, the garb of Abu Ghraib inmates, and the inimicable face of hero/revolutionary/terrorist Guy Fawkes all serve as poignant reminders of what we are to be seeing in this film. <br /> <br />The selection of Hugo Weaving, in and of itself is a triumph; his voice, his mannerisms, all lend themselves to the somber , sobering, pensive yet expressive timbre of the revolutionary that we long to hear in times of need. Witty use of alliteration, references to the morbid Macbeth and the flighty Twelfth Night only add to the illusory world that our hero both leads usinto and out of. Fawkes' coutenance only lends itself further to the idea that our real world and our real personas lie beneath the surface.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most relevant and wonderful reference is to that of Edmond Dantes. V's struggle parallels Edmond's to the T. Imprisoned in a tower, receiving notes from a stranger, escaping, living a life of luxury free want want, surrounded by great works of art, yet still hidden from his true self, tormented by demons long thought exorcised.  Vengeance, remembrance, forgiveness, redemption and love.. all motifs that run deep through the undercurrent of this film, and throughout its historical and literary reference. All of which add to the  power of its message.  <br /> <br />Are we to be supplicants to the state; at what point do we fear the direction that the collective has taken on behalf of the individual. Orwellian references aside, more powerful and sinister forces are at work around us.. and what we are presented here with is a well crafted, cogent message to be heeded. Not mired in the muck of the usual superficial  Hollywood 2 hour long drones, V for Vendetta is a feast for the senses and a veritable smorgasbord for the mind.
B00005JP7M|5.0|Not as great as \\"Match Point\\" or other Allen classics.  But \\"Scoop\\" is the funniest movie I have seen by Allen in a really long time.  I LOL when Johansson explained to Jackman why she wears glasses: \\"I don't like to put my finger on my eyeballs.\\"  Well, I guess you had to see it.  Highly recommend if you have a sense of sardonic humor.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|\\"Unforgiven\\" has to be rated as the top Western's of the 20th Century. It is well made and has great actors. Hackman's role in \\"Unforgiven\\" is so well played he deserved all the awards of that year. Eastwood and Freeman are well suited to make more movies in the near future. All in all \\"Unforgiven\\" has to be in your collection of movies even though you may not like Western's. Highly recommended, Buy-It Now!!! Ed
B0000C8AW2|4.0|Help!  I can't get the music to Changing of the Guards, out of my head.  It is obviously my favorite cut on the CD.  If I had to pick, I'm generally into CD's more for the melody than the lyrical content.  Senor (Tales of Yankee Power), and True Love Tends to Forget, are very strong musically as well.  As another reviewer mentions, this is probably an underrated album.  I give it a solid B.  I find most of the other songs, good but not great.  As always, I find the lyrics challenging but thought provoking and interesting.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I really don't know what made me buy this album. I ignored it for so long. Almost a year. <br />This album is really different, genre-wise. <br /> <br />I was a fan of his music before. But now, I'm not just a fan of his music... but of his talent. <br />I actually liked all songs, however, I liked vultures and gravity the most. <br />I'm not so sure if everyone will love this album, however, no one can deny the man's talents. <br /> <br />He is a talented songwriter. <br /> <br />\\"Instead of studying music, I want to create it.\\" And create he did. <br />Props also the drummer -steve jordan and the bassist- pino palladino. <br /> <br />I really feel that this is an experiment that yielded great results.
B00005JP5J|5.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a delightful, quirky summer comedy starring Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear. Toni and Greg plays the married couple Sheryl and Richard. They are raising two children together Olive (Abigail Breslin) and Dwayne (Paul Dano). It is implied in the film but never really said for sure that Richard isn't the children's father. The film does make a brief mention that Sheryl is divorced. Alan Arkin is the irreprehensible but loveable foul-mouthed, heroin snorting grandfather who lives with the brood because he was kicked out of his retirement home. Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrell) comes to live with the family after he is discharged from the mental institution after he had attempted suicide. This family puts the fun in dysfunctional with all their insecurities and other emotional issues that plagues them.<br /><br />The premise of the film has the entire family go on a road trip to California where Olive had been declared winner of a local beauty pagent by default and is one of the contestants for the final competition in Redondo, California. Most of the film revolves around the car trip. All of the family's neuroses comes to head. Everything that could go possibly go wrong on a car trip did go wrong for Sheryl and Richard.<br /><br />This was a terribly funny film and a lot of the credit goes to Alan Arkin as the heroin snorting grandpa who steals every scene he is in. Normally teenage angst in most films are over the top and so stereotypical but Paul Dano's performance as the Nietzsche-loving Dwayne was spot on. For most of the film, Dwayne was silent because he took a vow of silence until he achieved his goal. Despite his pessimistic view of his family, he still loved them. Steve Carrell was hilarious as Frank. I loved the scene where he matches wit with Richard in the VW van. Toni Collette was wonderful as Sheryl. She has quickly become of my favorite actresses. The films she choses to work in are impeccable and as Sheryl her performance certainly deserves to be recognized by the Golden Globes and/or the Oscars. Finally there is the irresistable Olive who is nothing more than a bundle of energy and is a real treat to watch in every scene. Her scenes in the last ten minutes of the film were hilarious.<br /><br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is proof that summer films don't need special effects or big name actors. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" proves that all you really need is a really good script and actors who are able to stay true to form as the characters they embody.ce certainly deserves to be recognized by the Golden Globes and/or the Oscars.

B0007PAMR4|4.0|Given the amount of criticism this film had received, I sat down to watch this DVD expecting to be confused and, worse still, bored to tears. Having now seen it, I still find the former to be true, but certainly not the latter: for all its baffling technical jargon and incoherent character relationships, Dune is a gripping film, moving quickly (almost too quickly) to nestle into the two hours it fills.  <br />I came to this film as a Lynch fan, not (by any stretch of the imagination) as a science fiction fan. Though it sticks out in the director's canon as somewhat of an oddity, it frequently shows it to be a Lynch film: the symbolic montages, the use of dreams and reliance on strong visuals. (What's more, there's at least three Twin Peaks cast members in here, most obviously Kyle MacLachlan).  <br />While I found it hard, from the outset, to follow exactly what was going on (the first half of the film introduces characters, and I found it hard to see where all of them `fitted in' to things), the basic narrative is a simple, strong one. Whatever the film is visually beautiful, even if some of the special effects (computerised fight scenes, glowing aliens) look a little dated now. Still, the ambition and imagination of Dune makes up for this, and its other flaws, making it a memorable experience: one to add for David Lynch fans.
0743454537|5.0|This was such an enjoyable read!!!<br /><br />It took a little getting used to at first because each chapter was written from the viewpoint of a different character.<br /><br />I knew exactly how I felt and what I would do about this type of situation before I even picked up the book...so I thought.  The author did such a wonderful job expressing the emotions of the characters that I found myself able to understand each and every one of them.<br /><br />The ending is so amazing it will blow you away!
B000002LAB|3.0|It took me a while to come round to late-era Miles Davis, but after buying the excellent Live Around The World, I felt `ready' for Tutu. People here seem to be making the mistake of trying to find what they like of the Kind of Blue-Miles in these later works, when they are best approached with a more open mind.  <br />While, for me, the On The Corner / Live Evil Miles is the period I most enjoy, I still found Tutu a satisfying experience. Though the backing is very much 'of the period', Miles's trumpet playing has much more in common with his playing in the late 1950s than of the work he'd done in the 1970s. His playing often sounds tired on the album, yet this balances well against the heavily synthesized backing tracks, adding a much-needed organic counter-balance.  <br />The mistake is to see this as any sort of jazz album: it's not. This is essentially a pop album, with the trumpet filling the role of a vocalist. The inclusion of Scritti Poltti's Perfect Way makes this very obvious.
B000000WA4|5.0|I don't know, why it has taken me this long to write a review for this album.  I purschased this album in 1995 when it first came out.  After my first listen, I was impressed, but I did not truly apriciate this album, until I listented to it several times all the way through.  This is truly a masterpeice of an album.  It has every emotion on this album.  Yes I love Siamese Dream and Gish, but this album is the best and I understand why Billy went a differnt direction after this album, because how do you top a masterpiece. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are thru the eyes of ruby, \\"XYU\\" and Stumbleine.  I also loved the \\"areoplane flyes high boxset, which is all the left over songs that were recorded during the session.  If you don't have this album get it and give it the time it deserves.  Trust me!       <br />
B000FGGE68|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  I didn't care anything about any of the characters, and the special effects were laughably bad.  Even Milla didn't look that hot in this movie as her previous ones, but she was still the only reason to see this waste of time. \\"What are you mental?\\" Blah!

B00080ZG10|5.0|Saw this while Puppy sitting. <br /> <br />DiCaprio isn't one of my favorite actors but he  did a superb job portraying Howard Hughs. One of aviation's unsung heroes, most people think Howard Hughs as the long haired semi-mad recluse paranoid about disease that Johny Carson so often mocked. Yet Hughs is one of the top aviation pioneers of the beginning time. Indeed if Hollywood had tried to make up a character like him for the films, nobody would believe he was real. Yet Howard Hughs the man was very very real and very very human. <br /> <br />This film avidly portrays him. Portrays him well.  His antics in Hollywood. His pioneering flights. His record setting flights. His committment to aviation as the future. His slow decline into madness.    <br /> <br />Scenes great. Costuming wonderful. Character acting supurb. Special effects well down and not over done.  <br /> <br />A good film.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I had no idea how much my 2 1/2 year old daughter would love this movie until we saw it.  She's seen it 5, yes 5, times now, and she gets more excited each time she sees it.  It's such a nice change of pace to watch an exciting well-made kid's movie.  The cg-graphics are spellbindingly awesome, and the cast of characters is unforgettable.  My girl \\"acts out\\" scenes from the movie with her die-cast cars every day.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Many of us have waited for some time for Grand Prix to be issued on DVD, and the new release seems to live up to expectations.  Picture quality is excellent, apparently digitally remastered, and it comes with several bonus features.  The only drawback is that the movie spans two DVDs, requiring a disk change during the movie's process.  But, despite the shallow and sometimes overdramatic plot line showcasing the key characters' tortured love lives and obsession with death, Grand Prix is still the best movie made to date about auto racing because of the innovative technical work and its outstanding depiction of Formula One's classic era.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I just picked up this DVD and must say first and foremost, I was totally blown away with the sound quality. When I read some of the mixed reviews about the sound quality of this DVD, I don't get how anyone could be complaining unless their Surround Sound system (or if they even have one) is one of those Wal-Mart specials that all the pieces come in one box. My system is a very powerful 6.1 THX HTS that also is equally powerful as a 2 channel stereo system. The problem with those low-end Surround Sound package deal systems is that for most practical purposes, will suffice the average person watching a movie in surround sound (but most likely, lacking seriously in deep realistic bass area, AKA, the sub-woofer). But switch those cheap-o systems over to audio only, and alas, that's when you get smacked right in the face (or ears) and realize just how much sound quality you're losing and why the whole package was a bargain at under $500. All being said, the Pulse DVD is basically an audio DVD with video. Don't get me wrong, I dare not try and comment or criticize Pink Floyd's visuals which should ever go un-credited, but for anyone to say the audio portion of this DVD is weak or poor quality, must not have a very good system. My point is that Pulse blew me away, first, with the audio portion of it. I've been a Pink Floyd fan since the release of Ummagumma, not new fare weather fan that asks, \\"which guy is Pink Floyd\\". Somehow, I never got to see them live and this DVD was the fill-in I needed. There a part when the lighting is so strong you can't see what's going on but usually those are short-lived moments. At other times, the video is awesome (not really the quality but the band and light show). My biggest complaint is there are not enough times when the cameras are on the band members during those crucial sound sections. Like during one a guitar lead or riff that make the sound and you want to see Gilmore playing up close. Of course there are times when the cameras are right on but more so they visual is taken back so the viewer can see the whole stage. David Gilmore has never been one of those guitarists that I rank my \\"the best\\" category but seeing him on this DVD has awakened me to his playing level. I usually listen to bands that have great jams, with guitars riffs that we all remember and love playing air guitar to like Jack Bruces' bass on I'm So Glad, Steve Howe's ending performance in Starship Trooper, Page in Stairway....., Clapton in Badge, Mark Farner in Inside Looking Out, etc etc, to say just a few). It's a bit sad for me to say it, but I had to see Pink Floyd live, before being able to rank Gilmore up there with the best. Bottom line boys and girls, if you like kicking back and cranking up the jams and you are a Pink Floyd fan, get this DVD. It's that simple! You won't be disappointed. I promise!e right on but more so they visual is taken back so the viewer can see the whole stage.

0312330537|5.0|This rates up there with Foucault's Pendulum and Cryptonomicon.  Of the thousands of books I've read, one of the very best.
0060934719|4.0|This is a lovely mix of fantasy and faery. Gaiman's characters and plot lines stack up with the brothers Grimm, but he adds some flesh and personality. But not too much personality - we don't get bogged down in introspective angst or belabouring the human condition. He's kept it simple, but managed charm over banality. We're carried along by the events, sure, but none of the characters are throwaways: my favourite was the unnamed `little hairy person' - the scene where Tristan meets him is a cracker. The magic feels magical, the innocents are good, the witches are bad, and the conventions work for Gaiman, not against him. Moreover the mix of plots and subplots is pretty much seamless - it's unusual to not notice a few bumpy links here and there, but I just realised I didn't notice a thing (well, maybe the topaz...).<br /><br />It's refreshing that our hero's good nature and upbringing primarily help to get him through - that fairy tale morality that often sees a kind deed pay off (as opposed to a mystical orb of chaos or preternatural martial skills). There's even something of the feel of George MacDonald's excellent [[ASIN:1461033284 The Princess and Curdie]] (and without a single early sexual episode you could probably recommend it to kids as well as grown ups) - the strength, and maturity, of innocence: well, in his acknowledgements Gaiman does doff his cap to McDonald's greatest fan, the unfashionable C.S. Lewis.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Although the filmmakers took a few liberties with Jane Austen's classic novel, Joe Wright's version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is absolutely exquisite. I am a huge fan of the novel and I usually tend to get very uppity when anything about a book is altered for the big screen, but I ADORED this movie! It is absolute perfection. Keira Knightley is expertly cast as the fiery, headstrong Elizabeth Bennett, and I was blown away by Matthew Macfadyen's portrayal of Mr. Darcy. However, the entire cast is incredible. The film is also beautifully scored and the scenery is spectacular. \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is a powerful and amazing love story, and I was in tears at the very end of the film because it is so incredibly emotional. BRAVO!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I AM SOOOOO EXCITED THAT THIS SHOW IF FINALLY GONNA BE AVAILABLE ON DVD! I grew up with this show and have watched the reruns here and there but it's no the same! I can not wait for November! I look forward to collecting all 10 seasons!
B000063UR2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie - both versions.  The score is really beautiful. It gives you feelings of sadness, fear, happiness - yes all of these in great DTS sound. A younger Tom Cruise in the days when he wasn't so well-known, portrays the fictional character and hero who overtakes evil and restores goodness and light to the world. Great makeup jobs on the Lord of Darkness and the goblins for a 1986 film. Great bonus features and good commentary. What a story!  What a fairy-tale!
B00004YYDI|5.0|This recommendation is for the uncut version of Leon - The Professional.  A well crafted, tightly edited, excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll.  An action film that can be appreciated by those who generally don't care for the genre, the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it.  If you're looking for something worthwhile to watch, check this one out.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|There's something about a British cast and crew that just seem to add a richness and lend instant prestige to a movie project. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but Nanny McPhee, with its blend of wide-eyed wonder and British sensibilities, resonates within me, much as Mary Poppins did years and years ago. Then there's also the quality name of Emma Thompson, who is one of our finest actors.<br /><br />Widower Cedric Brown (Colin Firth), who stodgily works at a funeral home, is clueless when it comes to raising his seven  children. This unruly brat pack, ringleadered by Simon (Thomas Sangster, of Love Actually) is clever and very (to the umpteenth power) naughty. They've already notched 17 harried nannies on their belts, the most recent of whom now believes that the bothersome Brown kids are cannibals. What is a despairing father to do? The nanny agency refuses to send him any more help, and now a mysterious, ethereal voice is advicing him that \\"what you need is Nanny McPhee,\\" whoever she is.<br /><br />One stormy, misbehaved evening, as the kids rampage in the kitchen (with the helpless cook trussed up and despite her written contract that the tykes not be allowed in her workplace), a resounding knock is heard and an ominous silhouette is glimpsed thru the door. Nanny McPhee (an uglified Emma Thompson), when she is admitted to the household, is revealed to be an unwholesome looking nanny, indeed. She is afflicted with gruesome warts, a reddened, tumescent nose, and a snaggletooth that resembles a tombstone. She gravely informs Mr. Brown that she is a government nanny and that her terms consist of imparting 5 lessons and that she requires her Sundays off. A bewildered but relieved Mr Brown is all too happy to let her toil away.<br /><br />The seven baffled but rebellious children are combative at first, but they very quickly learn not to trifle with Nanny McPhee, who goes around with a dauntingly crooked walking stick and seems to be able to work magical wonders. Soon, the kids are behaving up to the Victorian England standards of civility and decorum. And, with every lesson taught, another gross feature on Nanny McPhee's face vanishes, which can't possibly be some kind of metaphor at all, could it?<br /><br />With the domestic issues seemingly resolved, outside forces now threaten the Brown clan. It turns out Mr. Brown has been having trouble making ends meet and has been providing for his household largely via the allowance meted out by Lady Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury). But now the stuffy and proper Aunt Adelaide has demanded that one of the girls be given over to her care and that Mr. Brown be wed within the month, lest his allowance be withheld permanently. A frantic Mr. Brown begins to go over his list of eligible female acquaintances and comes upon a very bad choice: the intolerably mean, despicable, and probably color blind Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie). The children are appalled, Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) - the yearning and lovely scullery maid - is appalled, even Mr. Brown hinmself is appalled. But, no worries; with some ambiguous advice from Nanny McPhee and some ingeniuty by the Brown kids, it'll probably work out all right.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee is an enchanting family film, as could only be realized by a stable of British actors and film crew. The vibrant, eye-popping, color-splashed set designs and costumes are very nicely used to help bring this child's fable to the big screen. Comparisons with Mary Poppins are inevitable, as her persona is similarly aloof, notwithstanding her magical tendencies. Like Mary Poppins, Nanny McPhee is based on a book - in this case, based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books. Emma Thompson herself adapted these books into the working screenplay.<br /><br />Emma Thompson, as the calm pulse of the show, anchors the movie with her reserved yet compassionate portrayal of Nanny McPhee. Her character's occasional grunts often is a nonverbal commentary on someone's foolhardy behavior. The kids, especially, act out their roles with zest and some skill (Thomas Sangster, I do believe, is going places), while Angela Lansbury hams it up as the prickly aunt. And what can I say about Colin Firth, other than I'm a fan of his? He's quite good as the befuddled and beleaguered Cedric Brown. Director Kirk Jones helms the picture with an energetic, nicely-paced, kid-friendly hand.<br /><br />The stuffed special features include:  2 film commentaries, one with Director Kirk Jones and the cast of kids, the other with Producer Lindsey Doran & Emma Thompson; a \\"Casting the Children\\" featurette; \\"Village Life,\\" a featurette about the set designs; a Nanny McPhee Makeover, where you see Emma Thompson transform into the bewarted nanny; seven deleted scenes, including an alternate opening; an unfunny gag reel; and \\"How Nanny McPhee Came to Be,\\" a featurette about Christianna Brand and Edward Ardizzone, the writer and illustrator of the Nursa Matilda books.<br /><br />What else is there to say? Nanny McPhee follows in the tradition of The Wizard of Oz, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Mary Poppins. I'm pretty sure that's what the powers that be were aiming for, in crafting this film (and also to make some cash). Years from now, kids will be watching this magical film with delight. Not a bad legacy, that.vior. The kids, especially, act out their roles with zest and some skill (Thomas Sangster, I do believe, is going places), while Angela Lansbury hams it up as the prickly aunt. And what can I say about Colin Firth, other than I'm a fan of his? He's quite good as the befuddled and beleaguered Cedric Brown. Director Kirk Jones helms the picture with an energetic, nicely-paced, kid-friendly hand.<br /><br />The stuffed special features include:  2 film commentaries, one with Director Kirk Jones and the cast of kids, the other with Producer Lindsey Doran & Emma Thompson; a \\"Casting the Children\\" featurette; \\"Village Life,\\" a featurette about the set designs; a Nanny McPhee Makeover, where you see Emma Thompson transform into the bewarted nanny; seven deleted scenes, including an alternate opening; an unfunny gag reel; and \\"How Nanny McPhee Came to Be,\\" a featurette about Christianna Brand and Edward Ardizzone, the writer and illustrator of the Nursa Matilda books.<br /><br />What else is there to say? Nanny McPhee follows in the tradition of The Wizard of Oz, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Mary Poppins. I'm pretty sure that's what the powers that be were aiming for, in crafting this film (and also to make some cash). Years from now, kids will be watching this magical film with delight. Not a bad legacy, that.

B000002UAR|5.0|I have been listening to Revolver since 1972 and I regard it as more of their turning point than Sgt. Pepper.  Pepper has some of my favorite Beatle songs and some of my least favorite.  The 60's seemed a long time ago in 1972 and it's funny to think of it in those terms looking back that far.   When I bought it,  I only regarded it as another Beatle album and like the White album and Abbey Road, it is now one of my favorite Beatle albums and probably my favorite from their mid period.   Having no expectations about a creative work is possibly the best way to experience that work for the first time and getting familiar with Revolver was a wonderful experience.   (I think that when I got into the Beatles, the world was waiting for the next big thing to top them and nothing evenly remotely close happened)   I particularly like the British version of Revolver because several of the songs that were taken off the Capital version were John songs that I especially liked.  \\"I'm only Sleeping\\", \\"And your bird can sing\\" and \\"Doctor Robert\\" were not singles but are some of my favorite Beatle songs ever and without them on Revolver, the album is too much Paul and the album doesn't have as hard an edge.   Don't get me wrong, McCartney is my favorite Beatle and he really shines on Revolver, but John's songs typically don't wear out their welcome as much as a McCartney tune.  The two writers balanced each other perfectly but Revolver probably marked the end of John being the leader of the Beatles to being an \\"artist\\".   If you look at the Beatles output in terms of singles, John wrote and sang the vast majority of the A-sides through Rubber Soul.  After Rubber Soul, the only A-side single release he wrote and sang was \\"All you need is Love\\".   Of course, he was always contributing songs that were masterpieces.  \\"Lucy in the Sky\\"  and \\"Come Together\\" being my favorite examples.
B00081U7HC|4.0|It's been quite a few years since I've watched this \\"classic\\" pairing of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. The movie is full of great dialogue and situational humor and a realistic development between both characters. There were a few instances where the leads weren't in their best form when it came to acting ability, but I imagine we'll see a 25th-Anniversary version on the shelves. I think people will want to see this movie for awhile.
0440295734|5.0|I love this book, and have dubbed it \\"my favorite\\"- however, I do have a lot more Grisham to read.  But, it still is an amazing book.  I really got to know and develope a love/hate relationship with the characters.  The tempo of this book is steady and even, and is definately a page turner- I could not put it down.  I highly recommend it to people who are new to Grisham, it's an excellent example of the tone and pace that is prevelant in many of his novels.
0743454537|5.0|I usually go for mysteries but when I saw this book on the shelf I just had to read it. I was drawn into the story immediately and could not put the book down. I like the way the main character shifts from chapter to chapter so that we can see things from the perspective of other characters. The main character was so strong and so brave to go up against her parents. Picoult let me down with her ending. In her reader's note at the end of the book she said that she couldn't end it any other way.........yeah right!! It was an unessary plot twist. Overall the book is really good and even though the ending could have been different I would reccommend it.
0440241588|4.0|I'd have to say this is another home run for Grisham.  I just love his writing style.  With this book, as with many others- you just love to hate the main character (and vice versa) in this case, Joel Backman.  I was really hooked into this one, Grisham did an excellent job painting scenery and emotion in this book.  I found myself looking over my shoulder and feeling like I was being followed after I read this.  Excellent!
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Mark and Emmylou blend well together, and neither takes the spotlight. Don't expect Dire Strait's sound, as on other Mark Knopfler albums
B00005JNQS|4.0|Loved this movie so much!  Outstandingly done and hilarious.  A must buy!
B00005JMEW|5.0|`Kill Bill' has received a lot of praise and love from fans and critics alike, but up until this week I had yet to watch it.  Now, after watching both volumes I can attest to the fact that these films really are that good.  It's refreshing to see something we've never seen before be done so well, so expertly crafted so it feels like the film you've been waiting for.  It's a perfect example of a revenge story gone terribly...right.  Tarantino wrote and of course directed a masterpiece here, mixing all the great aspects of kung-fu films and westerns as well as anima and comic books giving us a brilliant script coupled with acting worthy of Oscarbait wrapped in a beautiful package and delivered to you DVD player. <br /> <br />This tale tells the story of The Bride (Thurman), a former assassin who was brutally attacked during her wedding rehearsal by her former colleges.  The attack resulted in the murder of her closest friends and her husband to be, as well as her unborn child.  What it failed to do was take the life of the main target, and upon awakening from her four year coma she's out for revenge. <br /> <br />Thurman does a brilliant job taking what could have been pure camp and creating a memorable character in the history of movie cinema.  As The Bride tracks down her former friends and picks them off one by one we see her grow stronger with anger and determination as she works towards her goal to `Kill Bill'.  Sporting great supporting roles by Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu as two former assassin's that meet their end at the hands of a woman scorned.  The film itself is filmed brilliantly with over the top action (the violence being so unrealistic it's almost funny...and that my friends is half the fun) that makes for an exciting ride that all will enjoy. <br /> <br />Quentin has cemented himself as one of the most genius directors we have today, not afraid to make a statement, to bend the rules and test our tolerance.  He is a moviemaker above all others who always serves up the best plate on the table.
B000000OA6|5.0|First of all anything with Freddie Mercury singing is going to be five stars because he is the greatest male vocalist in the history of popular music and he will prove this on every single track on the album. The reason I can say this with such confidence is because Freddie was dealing with vocal nodules, four extra teeth, and last but not least AIDS, and he will still sing better than 99 percent of all singers at the time so it's truely amazing what he does on \\"Don't Try So Hard\\". Brian May will give his very best to you on his guitar to the point where you might possibly cry (especially Bijou). Roger Taylor writes some of the best songs on here and Deacon is more unsung on this album. Every song on here has greatness to it, not to say they are all great but even songs like \\"All God's People\\" and \\" Delilah\\" have something really likeable about them. Every other song on here is stellar or amazing. Listen to this 10 times and you can only give five stars.
B000F48CD8|4.0|I keep rediscovering this CD on every listen through.  I imagine it will be one I will listen to regularly for years to come.
B00005JO1R|5.0|I was very impressed with the movie itself, let alone the fantastic extras in the Collector's Edition. Still what resonates is the film itself and the sheer talent of its cast, the story it tells and the attention to every last detail. Not only is it an interesting biopic, but also a musical marvel and an epic love story. I highly recommend this DVD.
0743201140|5.0|We have used \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" by Marcus Buckingham in several training situations; with our board of directors, with our leadership cabinet, and with our staff.  In each case, the participants have been enthusiastic about the results and  knowing how their strengths can help them to grow both personally and professionally.  Our successful use of this book has been dependent on the services of a professional training group that led each group through an in depth understanding of what the strengths are and how they can be used to enhance teamwork.
0451167716|5.0|As a fan of the movies , Godfather I and II, I cannot help but visualize the characters as the actors who portrayed them while reading this. I recently re-read the book after many years of watching the films over and over. Based on that I can conclude that the casting for the movies was absolute genius because every single person that Puzo created in the novel is perfectly captured in the films.<br /><br />The screenplay must have written itself because the dialogue in the novel is so well realized. There are some subtle plot variations that were either deleted in the film version or slightly altered to make it more dramatic on screen.<br /><br />All of that said , this book is a serious page turner and highly enjoyable read. The examination of the origins and subculture of the mafia has essentially become part of American folk legend as a result of this book. Puzo forever altered our way of thinking about these people by giving us a Godfather with numerous aspects that have become popular cliches regarding organized crime.
0393035158|5.0|First, let me advise you that the review offered by George R Dekle \\"Bob Dekle\\" (Lake City, FL) entitled \\"The End of Tolerance: Irreligion, Terror, and the Future of Unreason\\" presents misinformation.  Nowhere in \\"The End of Faith\\" does Sam Harris offer a \\"...bald assertion that people should be killed if they subscribe to the wrong beliefs\\".  He does not, as Mr. Dekle states, espouse \\"...killing people because they happen to have the wrong belief system\\". <br /> <br />Sam Harris does an outstanding job articulating the unreasonableness of religion - and the dangers of it.  This is a great book for anyone with an open mind.
0743490304|4.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's book, and this is up there. It's very \\"Dan Brown\\" as his stories go with great research (though people will claim differently) and description and he always seems to touch on very important subjects. In this case it's about Nasa and Space research.<br /><br />It also is very good with the supsense and thrills, and it seemed to be to a lot more action oriented which was really entertaining.<br /><br />The only thing i have to say about this, is that there really is no SUPER great twist at the end like i've come to see from hsi other books. You kind of already know what's going to happen by the middle of the book, and there is one tiwst that's not all that big, and a pertty funny one at the end, but that's about it.<br /><br />Still enjoyed it alot though.
0375758992|1.0|Alright, so her childhood was a bit different than your average white middle-income childhood.  <br /> <br />Should this motivate anybody to write a completely non-imaginative, devoid of any insights book?  <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the exotic side of it. A poor writer can ruin a story, regardless of the exotic locale.  <br /> <br />If you were expecting to find an \\"international\\" jewel like Jhumpa Lahiri's \\"The Namesake\\" or Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\", you will be greatly disappointed.  <br /> <br />If you are into Africa, read something that has more than the exotic place to say for itself. Ben Okri's \\"The Famished Road\\"  (booker prize winner) or The Palm-Wine Drinkard and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (Paperback)  <br />by Amos Tutuola  will be much better choices.
B000002LGW|5.0|I can still remember when I first heard this album. I had it on cassette tape. I had an immediate positive reaction to the music. I was very glad when the cd version was released. this is a wonderfully documented account of a truly original band.As I listen to it, this many years later, the magic still remains. Some live albums fail in the attempt to keep the music fresh. This album succeeds in not only keeping the material fresh it also keeps it exciting!
074327931X|4.0|I think this book gives a good overview of the main concepts.  This book needs to be completed after you have other GMAT materials, e.g. Kaplat GMAT guide, the Official GMAT Review.  The quantitative section covers many of the questions that are very similar to the ones you see in the actual GMAT.  These tough questions in quant really helps.  The quant questions in the actual GMAT are much harder than the practice questions in official review.  However this book covers many of the tougher questions.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Much better than I imagined, Beautiful picture and audio, Last time I saw it was on VHS so wow! what an improvement. Just 1 problem need a bigger tv.
B000G759LW|5.0|Ever since I heard her song \\"Beautiful\\", I have become a very big fan of Christina Aguilera.  I had been waiting a long time for this album to come out and I haven't been disappointed.  I particularly like the last four tracks on disc two, especially \\"Mercy On Me\\".  Contrary to what other people have to say, I don't think that she has strained her voice. She sounds as amazing as ever.  I have always thought that she has one of the most amazing voices in music ever, not just in her generation.  Continuing to compare her to other singers from the last decade(ie. Britney Spears and company) is pointless as she has moved so far ahead of them, she is in a completely different league.  I have read other people's comments about how she has too many fillers in her album and how it is a waste of time and money.  How do they expect someone to have twenty-something songs be all amazing to them?  This album is for everyone, so some songs will be liked by certain people and some songs by others.  She has gotten about 4-5 hits per album on her other albums, and I believe she will do the same with this album.  How many artist can claim that kind of success?
B00005NG9Z|4.0|Every video AIC did is on this video in great quality of course.  It didnt have as much band footage as the advertisements seemed to insist, but nonetheless a cool video to add to the collection.
B000G759LW|5.0|Since her last album, \\"Stripped\\" four years ago, Christina comes back with a refreshing cd.  She did a wonderful job mixing the old sounds with the new.  The first disc has the sounds of today; pop mixed in with R&B.  The second disc offers rhythms and beats from the 1940's with today's edge.  Every song is fulfilling and great.  Highlights include \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\", \\"Back In The Day\\", \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", \\"Understand\\", \\"On Our Way\\", \\"Still Dirrty\\", \\"Candyman\\", \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\", and \\"I Got Trouble\\".  Every song showcases Christina's superb vocal ability.  I didn't think that I would like this album because of the old vibe to it but Christina puts a unique twist to every song, which makes listening to very enjoyable.  This cd is great from start to finish and it is worth every penny.  Buy this cd; you won't be sorry.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I'm not going to comment on the quality or features of the DVD - they mean little to me. However, I was surprised and delighted to discover the additional scenes that were added - they did a great job of filling in the Kryptonian background.  Fleshed out a movie that had already done a great job of fleshing out a comic book character.
1569382603|5.0|I understand the feeling in all reviews. I also watched them on television, about five years ago and got completely astonished! It suddenly brought to my mind a comprehension of many missing points in ancient history. Human history suddenly made sense. Nothing over, no ETs, just fitting clues. I also thought about how a new past can help us to build a new future. The one towards we're going, certainly won't last long.<br /><br />I think it's about time to sell these videos in DVD!
B000A6T262|4.0|Being able to watch all of the Star Trek movies has been wonderful. The DVDs play well, no rewinding, I can rewatch my favorite scenes, catch commentary, and enjoy my trip to the future.
0743455967|2.0|I plowed through this book in a few hours yesterday morning.  Not that it was spellbinding like most of King's books, but because I just wanted to get it over with.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there were some cool scenes mostly revolving around his actual books.  I liked learning how he slowly broke into the biz.  His writer's block on the Stand.  Being coked up writing the Tommyknockers.  How he came up with some of his ideas.  Getting that phone call that told him he was getting 400K for the Carrie paperback.<br /><br />Other than that, there wasn't much I cared for.  As with 99.9% of the autobiographies I have read, his childhood and things of that nature were boring.  As was most of his advice regarding the actual writing aspect of the book.<br /><br />I'm sure there are aspiring writers who would eat up every word of this, but not me.  While not an aspiring writer, I have written a handful of short stories and even got 100 pages through a novel(before my comp erased it!!).  I didn't need On Writing to tell me dialogue is tough.  I know because I have a good time writing a story, but when it comes to the necessary speaking parts I cringe.  Not just coming up with believable conversation, but the grammar side of it.  All the spacing and paragraphs and quotations!!!!<br /><br />Either way, I would only recommend this book to someone looking to learn about the actual writing side of King's world.  If you're interested in the who, what, and where of things while he actually wrote(like I am), this is not the book for you.<br /><br />Stephen King if you read this.... the most interesting piece of non-fiction you can write for me is a book on your novels.  Maybe a chapter for each of your books.  Where you were in your life when you wrote them.  Ideas for the books.  The writing process behind each book.  etc.  Thats the kind of stuff I would pay to read about.
B00008WT5C|5.0|THIS IS A KILLER CD.  ONE GREAT ROCKER AFTER ANOTHER!
B000FGGE68|4.0|This is a sad case of I don't know what. The movie as a whole is nothing to rave about. It feels like you're watching your little cousin play a video game. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />BUT... I can't lie. I REALLY dig the action sequences in this film!!! These scenes are awesome! This chick downloads weapons into her freakin bloodstream or something and her entire arsenal comes out of her wrist.  <br /> <br />The fight/action sequences are good enough for me to add this film to my collection. I'll just skip the story attempt everytime and just watch the fight scenes and the shootouts.  <br /> <br />Yup, you saw that right. The action sequences in this film are worth the 4 stars to me.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is not a folk album; it's a blues album. And it's one of the best blues albums anybody ever recorded. I have a lot of Muddy Waters' CDs, and this one makes me stop and listen to how great his voice was, how well he could tell a story, how deeply he could hook you. You get that \\"back porch blues\\" feeling, like he's there with you on a hot summer night strummin' and singin' with a couple of friends he brought along. <br /> <br />This album is a must for any Muddy Waters--or blues--lover. <br /> <br />The remastered recording is quite clear and fresh, a great sounding album
038572179X|4.0|In my opinion, it's best to know as little as possible about this book before reading it, so I won't summarize here. Instead, I'll just say that while the characters are fairly well-developed from the outset, the reader is not fully privy to what's actually going until the last two pages; so once I finished reading, I looked back at the book in general (and certain scenes in particular) with a new appreciation for what I'd just read.  For instance, at first the final confrontation between some of the central characters seemed slightly overwrought to me, but looking back it now makes sense why the scene played out as it did.  Once I saw what was really going on it hit me that the book was far more beautiful and finely crafted than I first supposed, and a character who was not necessarily all that likable at the beginning became lovable, and, to me at least, incredibly sympathetic at the end. Recommended.
B000FSME1A|2.0|I am absolutely baffled at how one of the most incredible movies ever made can continue to get such bizarre treatment.  I was around 16 when this movie came out.  I saw it in the movie theater.  I knew little of Coppola and I knew absolutely nothing about the making of this movie.  The movie simply blew me away.  To this day it remains the most powerful movie experience I ever had.  There was simply nothing ever like it before, and there really has been nothing like it since. <br /> <br />Imagine the dissapointment to see this movie whittled away over the years with the documentary going into all the behind the scenes stuff that went into the making of it, and then the horror of Apoc Redux.   <br /> <br />While all that stuff is interesting in and of itself, here it just serves to degrade the masterpiece that came out in 1979.  I think if there was ever an argument against showing \\"behind the scenes\\" and \\"outtakes\\" it is this movie.   Way, WAY too many people go on and on about the making of the movie, and how Brando was fat, etc.  All that is besides the point.  WHO CARES?  It was all part of the creative process - and sometimes the creative process is a mess.  Sometimes a masterpiece is born out of a mess.  Should you stand around and go on and on about its birth, or should you just let it stand on it's own merit?  I'll answer, in the case of AN, just watch the movie and forget about the rest of the stuff, because the rest of the stuff is just the blood, tissue, and screams that went into the birth.  Get past that.  Just watch the life - and in this case the \\"life\\" of this masterpiece is the movie that came out in 1979.  The version I saw ended with the boat going down the river and the words \\"The Horror. The Horror.\\"  That's it.  Leave the canvas alone!  Stop touching it.  Stop messing with it!  Stop prying into its birthing process!  Just watch the freakin movie!   <br /> <br />And to that end they should just come out with the 1979 version again and release itwith some commentary.  That's it (It never ends with AN.  People went on and on about the French plantation scene for years and how it was so great.  Then Redux comes out the you see why the scene was left out: Because it's a total BORE.  Now they go on and on about the \\"5 hour cut.\\"  My god, the \\"5 hour cut\\" is an even great bore.  It's not even a movie.  It would be like reading Shakespeare's 27 drafts of Hamlet all at once.  Why would you ever want to do that!  Just read the final version!  If you love this movie, never try and see this.  It's awful.  Jeez, all this stuff got left out because it should have been left out.  The only thing watching all this 'extra\\" stuff has done is highlight how much of a miracle it was that they came out with such a brilliant movie when they had so much film to get lost in!).   <br /> <br />The other problem with the whole AN thing is Coppola himself.  This movie did something to him.  He never made another \\"great\\" movie after AN.  In fact, he was never quite \\"right\\" after AN.  His meter was off or something.  I have read most of what has been published about his take on AN and it's oddly lacking.  It's as though he doesn't quite get his own masterpiece.   <br /> <br />I think, at the end of the day, it was just one of those miracles of creation that come from an artist.  It just came out and was its brilliant self.  Coppola made it but somewhere along the line he lost control of it and himself.  Usually that spells creative disaster.  Here, somehow, it worked.  It worked brilliantly on an epic scale.   <br /> <br />So, what else is there to say?  Don't bother with this DVD.  Whatever you do, don't bother with Redux.  <br /> <br />I would also advise you to watch the Hearts documentary only for the true hardcore fans.  But in the end, just watch the movie and forget about all the rest of the crap.  It only diminishes the experience of watching this masterpiece.
0142000671|5.0|What never ceases to amaze me about this book is how much emotion Steinbeck packs into just over 100 pages.  Basically, this is one of the most moving, inspiring, and depressing books I've ever read - and also one of the best.  The characters, the dialogue, and the feel of the time and place are so real to me that I almost consider it a work of non-fiction; I just can't seem to read it without feeling sad for these poverty-stricken, down-and-out people trying to make their way through an unneccessarily cruel landscape without anyone who really cares about them.  It can be read in a day and the story is fairly straight forward, but I wouldn't call it an easy read - it's just too emotional to fit that description.  Great book.
B0009NZ3BO|5.0|Ah, the suffering I endured just to get a decent version of this recording.  Like a lot of other Gentle Giant fans, I rushed right out and bought what turned out to be a mono version of the album.  I eventually sent the mono version off to DRT in New York City and was issued this splendid stereo version.  Was it worth the effort? Yup.<br /><br />Before I forget, one way to tell if you have the stereo version is to examine the DRT catalog number on the spine.  The catalog number for the stereo version is RTE 00357.<br /><br />The lineup on this 1976 release is classic Gentle Giant:  John Weathers (drums); Derek Shulman (Lead vocals, saxophones); Ray Shulman (bass, violin); Gary Green (acoustic and electric guitars);and Kerry Minnear (Hammond organ, acoustic piano, electric piano, synthesizers - mostly ARP string ensemble I think).  The performances are incredible of course and both the ensemble work and counterpoint is staggeringly complex.  Although, I guess it's worth noting that the guys seem to be mellowing a little bit in their approach.<br /><br />The seven tracks on the album range in length from 3'30\\" to 6'59\\" and are all more or less characteristic of Gentle Giant's complex and unique blend of rock, European classical, medieval English music, and folk.  There are however other influences as well: Give it Back has a slightly reggae feel to it and Ray does a great job with the \\"off beats\\" on the bass guitar that give reggae its distinct sound.  Then again, this is Gentle Giant, so it really does not sound that much like reggae - more a subtle reggae flavoring if anything.  Design opens with the excellent vocal harmonies that they are known for and then segues into a very interesting percussion section that co-mingles with the vocals parts.  The soft-spoken acoustic textures and string synth on Empty City are just wonderful and this is easily my favorite track on the album.  Although I would love to go into a track by track analysis, suffice it to say that this is a great Gentle Giant album and most of the tracks sound somewhat similar to the material on Free Hand.<br /><br />With respect to the remastering it is extremely low-budget - the insert only contains the lyrics.  I think it is unfortunate that Rhino was not responsible for the remastering - they would have done an infinitely better job and given these albums the full treatment they deserve.  The sound quality of the live bonus track is positively horrendous.  Then again, this is Gentle Giant so I really don't care too much.<br /><br />All in all this is the last album of full-blown prog by the band and is very highly recommended along with Acquiring the Taste (1971), Three Friends (1972); Octopus (1973); In a Glass House (1973); The Power and the Glory (1974); and Free Hand (1975).ant album and most of the tracks sound somewhat similar to the material on Free Hand.

B00004WG2F|5.0|Legends of the Fall is a breathtaking epic that tells the story of the Ludlow family through the eyes of their elder indian friend \\"Stab\\" (Gordon Tootoosis). It takes place in the Montana Rockies beginning in World War I and stretching about two decades afterwards. <br />At the center of this epic is the three Ludlow brothers: Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Tristan (Brad Pitt), and Samuel (Henry Thomas), whose lives unwind telling tales of love, betrayal, guilt, and redemption. Their father (Anthony Hopkins) is a character whose performace warrants an academy award. <br />One of my favorite movies of all times. A movie featuring Pitt and Hopkins is always a winner.
B00005MP58|3.0|I luv-luv-luv Pride and Prejudice, I've read the book countless amounts of times. Initially I wasn't moved by this movie and almost decided I didn't like it, but the more I watch it the more I like it. I like how it stayed true to the book more so then any other screen adaptation I've seen. I love Colin Firth in this movie he is the absolute perfect Mr. Darcy. Overall it's a good movie that for me gets better everytime I watch it...

As a mother, a sister, a lawyer and a person, I could relate to the issues raised in this book on multiple levels and wondered how I would react.  I also loved the way the author brought in mutiple points of view.  I will be recommending this book to others.
1400079179|2.0|I finally caved in to the hype and read this book.  I wasn't expecting richly developed characters or elegant writing or intricately woven themes.  But I did think there would at least be an intriguing plot and some suspense.  Instead, what I found was a ridiculous plot, paper thin characters, bland writing, and not much suspense.  And, suspense was supposed to be the strong point.  Honestly, I thought the ending to this book was foreshadowed pretty heavily.<br /><br />As far as the controversy goes, this is fiction.  The piece of nonfiction that provided most of the background is widely regarded as hogwash by scholars.  So, I think those who are offended are making a mountain out of a mole hill.<br /><br />I know a lot of people just want a mindless read and don't want a book that will make them think.  If that is the case, you may enjoy the book.  However, I still think there are better works of suspense out there if you look for them.
B0000640SB|5.0|I remember I must've watched Men in Black at least 4 times during its theatrical run. I just really really liked it, then of course there's the VHS release now the DVD release. I don't know what it was that drew me in so quickly. I think it's a rare movie that manages to be on both spectrums, that of being silly and outrageous while being serious and straight-faced. And unlike Independence Day, this one's actually funny, better paced and just all around better.<br /><br />Aliens exist in the world with most of them looking very much like regular people. However, like people, some of them stray and try to stir some stuff up so in come the Men in Black, a secret organization that keeps aliens secret from everyone else. When one alien decides to cause some stuff that could spell doom for everyone on Earth(of course), it's up to Kay and new partner Jay to save the world.<br /><br />When the disappointing sequel came out a couple of years ago, Sony decided to re-release the film in a \\"Deluxe Edition\\". The extras are pretty much the same except for some previews for MiB II. So it's pretty much just buy this if you haven't got the old one but if you haven't, might as well get this one. The featurettes are ok but the commentary was slightly annoying. Presented in a quasi-MST3000/football match style, on occasion the director and Tommy Lee Jones almost act like guys who haven't seen movies ever with stuff like \\"and there's you saying that line\\" and whatnot.<br /><br />What ultimately makes the film succeed is a couple character moments throughout. Kay's backstory is explained involving a woman that helps the film become more than just a simple flashy blockbuster. Not to mention the film can still entertain with funny lines or just physical comedy. There's no weak link in the cast and the effects still hold up after all these years.<br /><br />Should you buy it? Definately. It's funny, exciting and it's perfectly paced. Just don't watch the sequel...eek.

B0006J28BO|5.0|Studio Ghibli, in a rough comparison, is similar to Pixar. They make wholesome family films that kids as well adults can enjoy. There's another similarity they have: all their films have been directed by in-house directors with very few outsiders coming in. Well like the Incredibles done by Brad Bird, The Cat Returns was done by someone other Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata, The Cat Returns done by Hiroyuki Morita and it's a charming movie that unfortunately runs a little too short. <br /> <br />Haru is a typical young girl: her ambitions for life are outmatched by her clumsiness and sleepiness. She's late for school, gets laughed at and often falls over and trips. One day walking home, she saves a cat from being hit by a truck but to her amazement the cat dusts himself off, says a few words and takes off. Word gets out and the Cat King from Cat Kingdom offers gifts for saving his son and decides to wed his son to Haru. Naturally the Prince is a cat and Haru doesn't want to get married but the Cat King's guys are coming regardless. With help from the Baron, a bird and a big cat, Haru has to escape the Cat Kingdom which is slowly turning her into a cat herself. <br /> <br />Similar to Spirited Away, Haru lives in a normal world and becomes part of a world bigger than herself. It's a quite charming little world too since they look so cute! but the film ultimately has a charm about it that you almost feel like you just wanna keep watching the characters just for the sake of it. While animation-wise it isn't as splendid as Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, it's a very attractive looking film. <br /> <br />Oddly the fault of the film is its length: it's too short. At a hair over an hour 10, it just feels like a world you keep wanting to experience and the film's short length just seems to come too soon. And also it feels like some elements were taken out such as how the Baron enters Cat Kingdom. But other than its length, I didn't really find any faults. <br /> <br/>Like other Ghibli films, they took utmost care for the English dub but rather than cast unknowns, they casted some bigger name stars. Anne Hathaway plays Haru, Cary Elwes is the Baron while Tim Curry is arguably the better one as the Cat King. While I can't really fault the actors, the film kind of lost its charm in a small way since the lines become a bit too simple and cheesy without the charm the Japanese had. Take for example the verbal fight between Muta the fat cat and Toto the bird. The lines about bird brain and chickens seemed more funnier in the original. <br /> <br />I'm too much of a collection junkie so of course I'll pick this up but luckily the film's great so it works out.
B000FIMG68|5.0|As a die hard Lost fan from the Season 1 debut, I have been a bit shocked to hear so many negative things about Season 2. The mystery of the island went much deeper and the season actually answered more questions than the first, while still whetting our appetite for more. I would love to see some loose ends tied up, but that is what makes people keep watching. Those who abandoned the show because of too many questions obviously don't have the patience required for a show such as this. In our \\"quick fix, gotta have it\\" society, it is refreshing to know that there is actually a show that will not simply give us questions and answers but an acutal story with strong characters and an intriguing plot. I cannot wait for Season 3 to premiere.
B00062ZE3U|4.0|I am new to Within Temptation, I'll admit it -- I only discovered them within this year.  Before then, I was a lunatic Nightwish fan, not dabbling in much else because I didn't think there was anything else.  Funny, how I will make the same mistake various times.  This album may not be the epitome of legendary beauty, but it IS good, and that is what counts.<br /><br />Sharon den Adel is an excellent singer.  She has a gorgeous voice that can hit the high notes and has a \\"heavenly\\" quality to it.  The band itself is also talented, with a nice balance of guitars and other instruments; they never drown each other out or overexert themselves, which is always nice.  The choir is simply spectacular.  Finally, there are some truly amazing songs here -- Angels, Jillian (I'd Give my Heart), and See Who I Am are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Moving on, the lyrics on this album aren't the most creative or poetic on the planet.  No analyzing or English major is required to figure out what is being sung.  For me, this is disappointing, as I don't like lyrics that are straightforward, and prefer something poetic and beautiful.  Even so, the lyrics of some of the songs, such as Angels, do have some charm to them, and none of them are downright annoying.<br /><br />Second, the songs on this album are somewhat lacking in variety and do start to sound the same if you listen to them many times.  Of course, this is not helped by the fact that the singer is the same every time, but I wasn't bothered by that -- It was the same sequence that was a little frustrating.  There's singing, then a chorus, then more singing, and a choir pops in at times.  The instruments used do not vary much, but for the most part they each get a chance in the spotlight at the beginning of a song.  Thus, I was not overly bothered by it.<br /><br />The only songs that are truly different are Pale, Somewhere, and The Swan Song, only because those three songs are softer, and I read somewhere that they use no guitars.  However, even though they stand out in the album, they don't stand apart from each other -- Even the lyrics are similar.  Beyond them, however, the songs do vary lyrically -- Angels is about being betrayed while Aquarius is about a sea god, for example.  It could be better, but it could also be drastically worse.<br /><br />Despite the similarities in the songs, Within Temptation does pull them off quite well; the only song I really am dissatisfied with is Aquarius, and that's only personal preference.  Den Adel sounds great no matter what type of song she is put in; she can pull off a variety of different emotions.  The band is also able to successfully show the mood of a song.  Overall, if it weren't for the talent of the band, I probably wouldn't like them half as much.<br /><br />Now that I am done being linear, here is one more thing.  The album does have a \\"gothic\\" feel to it.  Considering how overused this is in metal and other music genres, Within Temptation earns some credit for pulling it off with talent, and enough of it to make me ignore the slight creative setbacks and just enjoy it (that doesn't happen often).  In fact, despite all the flaws I mentioned, I still enjoy the album, and it helped me decide that I like Within Temptation more than Nightwish.<br /><br />Basically?  The album is good for what it is.  It isn't perfect and it isn't a masterpiece, but very few things are these days.  If you are a fan of symphonic metal and are looking for something new, I suggest you give this a try.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this, and happy listening!use no guitars.

0393327655|5.0|Finally, a book that does not insult your intelligence. Thank you Sam Harris, for citing your sources so thoroughly in this book.
0446677450|1.0|This book, I'm sorry to say, stopped me from further buying new English-language titles at my local Japanese book store. I guess I'm sick of being disappointed. In a temporary moment of insanity, I purchased this book expecting a great how-to that would show me the way to wealth. Instead, after reading the first 60 pages containing pure sentiment with no instruction, I found it to be just a small collection of cliches, sappy childhood stories (some of them I'm not so sure really happened the way Kiyosaki told them, I mean, how many strangers would talk like a commercial for his board game?), and suggestions of ideas with no concrete details.  <br /> <br />I was, however, reminded of 3 points my own father taught me (though our family was technically \\"right above the poverty line\\" until he died). Here they are in a nutshell: 1) a college degree isn't a guaranteed ticket to wealth (but it doesn't HURT!) and 2) spend your money on stocks, investments and real estate (though my father never did this himself. He lived his life on credit) and 3) Buy things for their function and usefulness, not for sentimental or emotional reasons. Good advice, especially if you live in the States or Japan, where shopping and eating are the only true ways to happiness. <br /> <br />So apparently, most of those key ideas in the book weren't original. If my father never read Kiyosaki's book, and Pappy told those ideas to me when I was a child, I guess the poor, middle class and rich are all teaching their kids the same thing.  <br /> <br />Funny. Maybe I should write a book, too. <br /> <br />
B00005RDRO|4.0|\\"Murder by Death\\" is a delightful and loving tribute/criticism about murder mysteries in the mid-20th century. Bringing together the characters from many famous series--Sam Spade, the Charleses, Miss Marple, Charlie Chan, etc.--and having them played by some of the great actors of the period--Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, David Niven, Elsa Lancaster, etc.--produced an enjoyable story. The twist after twist after twist amuses right to the end. My only concern is that, once one realizes that nothing is as it seems, a bit of the \\"suspense\\" is lost and replaced by waiting for the next layer to be peeled off.

I've even told rank strangers about this book!

0399230033|5.0|When my son was born, two of our friends independently decided that the best way to buy him a baby gift was to take their young daughters to a book store and let them choose books they thought he would like.  This was the only one they both selected.  Our son is still in the \\"I licked the corner and it was good\\" stage of book appreciation, but I've enjoyed reading it to him.  The pictures are colorful and interesting, with lots to point out to a small child.  And the storyline is surprisingly gentle, with the gorilla leading a parade of zoo animals to the zookeeper's home where they all curl up around his bedroom for sleep.  It's easy to see how this one made it onto the favorites list.

0385504209|5.0|This book was probably one of the best books I have read in a long time. When I opened the first page and got a taste of Dan Brown's descriptive text I thought that I would lose interest and put the book down after a few pages. This was most certainly not the case! Dan Brown starts off this fast paced thriller with a bang! From the first page of the prologue to the last page of the epilogue, I found myself saying \\"just one more page\\". I had about 1/4 of the book left when I started reading on night and I ended up so wrapped up with it that I stayed up until 1am so I could finish it! Throughout the entire novel the reader is left wanting to know what is going to happen next.<br /><br />The whole time I was reading this book, I was thinking to myself \\"wow! I can't believe that. Maybe I should think about that for a minute.\\". Then I would have to stop and remind myself that this is only a novel. A work of ficiton. The sign of a truly great novelist is one who can lose you in the novel and make you start to think that what they are writing about is true. When I get to the point in a book where I have to remind myself that what I am reading is not really true, I know that I have found a masterpiece! Dan Brown does an amazing job of incorporating fact into his fiction. His research is astounding and when I was reading the descriptive text of The Louvre, The Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, The Madonna of the Rocks, etc., it really made me believe that what was going on in the novel was what was going on in the real world. Of course, we are all smart people and can easily see the line between a novel and reality, but when reading this book, when one becomes so engrossed in it, that line starts to blur and you have to pull yourself back over to the other side every once in a while.<br /><br />This book was not only enjoyable but intellectually stimulating!<br /><br />-recommended
0553801503|3.0|After waiting for delays upon delays, I was really excited when this book was finally released and was able to finally purchase this book.  The first few chapters were pretty good, but you'll notice pretty quickly that most of the chapters are about the same characters.  That of Cercei, Jamie, Brienn, and the Ironmen.  There were a handful of chapters about Sansa and Arya also, but not enough of Arya.  All of the characters I found interesting were omitted.  Like other reviewers, I also found it a chore to finish this book.  I absolutely loved the previous three.  I hadn't known that this was only going to be half of a book, but upon further reflection I've realized that this really is only a \\"half\\" book.  It's only half interesting and about half filler.  Don't feel guilty about skimming the pages.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I am so pleased that the new series came out on DVD in America.  The quality of the shows is excellent.  If you are unfamiliar with the new series, but loved the old one, you should know that this series was lovingly created by people who were bviously Dr. Who fans.  The essential elements remain, with some interesting modifications to the mythos.  The quality of writing, acting, and effects is what would be expected of an outstanding 21st century science fiction show. <br /> <br />The discs have several hours of extras, including some very interesting behind-the-scenes items.  It would have been nice to have even more Dr. Who Confidential - it appears that the included versions were miniature versions.  The overarching theme of the season - basically life and death and the cost of each - makes repeat viewing essential.  You'll want to return and catch the clues for the final episode after you watch it (unless you cheated and read it on the web).  Overall, a fabulous, well-recommended series - you should buy it.

B00000269G|5.0|This best selling album from 1955 recorded live at Carmel, CA in a field recording style, does represent Erroll's talent very well and the strength of his piano playing overcomes the fact that it was hard for Columbia to record the drums and bass.  The CD though was remastered from THE original master tape using Sonic Solutions NoNoise system due to the fact that at the time of recording, the tape was exposed to salty air and is in poor shape.  The way the original Columbia 6-eye vinyl sounds is exactly the way the master tape sounds.  Sony was going to reissue a new remaster of this recording but found out that it just couldn't be done so we are lucky to have this available on CD from the master tape on a CD mastered in the 1980s.
B000002TQV|5.0|THE OVERALL: <br />this is my favorite album from one of my favorite bands.  Anybody who liked either OK Computer OR Pablo Honey can enjoy this to @least some degree <br /> <br />THE REASON: <br />One reviewer called this radiohead's \\"gateway album.\\"  This makes perfect sense to me.  Pablo Honey, a typical rock album, was radiohead before they found an origional sound.  With OK Computer, the 1997 multi-platinum release, is where radiohead would find themselves british legends.  This sofmore effort, however, has echos of both sides of the river.  Once radiohead had crossed the waters at to the banks of what we call OK Computer and into the wild woods in the forms of KID A and Hail 2 The Theif show raadiohead in a completely unrecognizable form from Pablo Honey.  Bends, to me, is in a way proof that this is the same band.  The Bends echos sounds of both Pablo Honey and OK Computer.  Take for example, songs like \\"Iron Lung,\\" \\"Bulletproof,\\" and \\"Street Spirit,\\" lean more towards OK Computer and later works, while \\"Black Star,\\" \\"Bones,\\" and the title track are more Pablo Honey-esque.  Other tunes, such as \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" could fit on either albums either way.  For that reason, it's hard for this cd to get old. <br /> <br />THE BREAKDOWN: <br />1. Planet Telex-this was origionally named planet Xerox, but the name is copyrighted and couldn't be used.  This is probably the album's weakest track. <br />2.Title Track-but that's okay, because this song ROCKS, harder and more of radiohead's roots. <br />3.High and Dry-Classic accoustic hit, one of my favorites ever. <br />4. Fake Plastic Trees-another classic accoustic hit, maybe the best political song ever written. <br />5. Bones-apparently about fatigue and the comming of old age, this harder-rocking tune is deep.  Listen and enjoy. <br />6. nice dream-more like an OK Computer tune, sounds dreamy, loveit. <br />7. Just-Not one of the stronger ones.  It's okay <br />8. My Iron Lung-quiet possibly, themost creative song in the Bends sessions. <br />9. Bulletproof-i heard some negative things about this one, that it was too long and hard to get into.  I don't understand, I don't think it clocks over 4 minutes. <br />10.Black Star-my fav! <br />11. Sulk-one of those neutral track. <br />12. Street Spirit-This sums up the cd in a way that can't be told in words.  This songs speaks to me as a profesy that the savoir, ok computer, is on it's way. <br /> <br />THE ANALYSIS: <br />buy this album if you are a radiohead fan or a fan of the 90's in general.  Don't think twice.

B00006AW2S|5.0|What younger listeners don't seem to get is that The Rolling Stones re-discovered Chicago Blues at a time when Muddy Waters was painting ceilings for a living. The first five Rolling Stones recording, ending with December's Children, are among the best white blues records of all time. For five kid from England, these guys really understood the sound and feel of electric blues from the era before Rock & Roll. Their taste was uncompromising. The addition of slide guitar (Brian Jones was the first slide player in England), cross-harp harmonica style, and raspy vocals were completely new to teenagers when they showed up in 1964. Frankly, if the Stones today could re-create the energy and intelligence of these early performances I suspect they'd have a real hit again. With no slight to the genius of Mick Taylor, the loss of Brian Jones in 1969 deminished greatly the stated Blues-based purpose of the band. I'm amazed as an adult revisiting these old recording at how well performed these tracks are. On Out of Our Heads the Stones explore soul recordings, vocally more complicated than their work on their first album,12X5 and Now. These tracks include songs by Smokey Robinson, Sam Cooke, and Otis Redding and Jagger does a credible job on them. It was hearing Jagger's arrangements of these songs that encouraged me to listen to the originals and ultimately changed my consciousness about what great singing really is.

B00005NKKZ|5.0|Not being a child of the Simon & Garfunkel, Beatles, The Who, and the sixties generation, many believe those my age (ah, the children of the ninties...) cannot truly have an appreciation for the beautiful lyrics and ideas of a duo such as Simon and Garfunkel. Well, first of all, the music is so incredibly dynamic and unforgettable by itself. Second, the poetry found in it is applicable and warmly welcome in these turbulent times today. A song like \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is just the saving grace that our generation, and all generations after us need.<br /><br />Every time I play this album, this unexplainable happiness and relaxation comes. I find myself dancing in my car to \\"Cecilia\\" and \\"Baby Driver\\" and unable to frown during \\"The Boxer,\\" \\"So Long Frank Lloyd Wright\\" (which, is, by the way, the most beautiful tribute I have heard) and \\"Only Living Boy in New York.\\" I guarantee that any true appreciator of music will feel the same way and I strongly suggest that you play this album for your kids forever... This classic must survive the generations!!!
B0000025DV|5.0|The year was 1977 and I was making minimum wage working at a large discount store chain.  I had discovered E.L.O just recently and had purchased all their albums to date, and then this massive colorful sci-fi looking double cocept album hits the shelves!!  Wow.  It came with a poster and a cardboard cut-out spaceship model too!<br /><br />And, it turned out to be a magnificent concept album!  Who cares if Jeff Lynne \\"wrote the songs that the Beatles didn't get around to writing\\"?  Someone had to do it, right?  The Beatles didn't do it so Jeff Lynn did.  And it's a good thing too!<br /><br />Oh yeah, doesn't \\"Across the Border\\" remind you of Brian Wilson's \\"Heros and Villians\\"?  Can't you hear the riff from George Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" in \\"Birmingham Blues\\"?  Does it really matter?  Could it have been Jeff Lynne's way of paying some tribute to other great musicians?  I don't know and I haven't done the research, but it occured to me.<br /><br />Oh yeah I almost forgot.  \\"Power cello riffs can only take you so far\\".  Yup.  That's what I think when I listen to Beethoven or Dvorak.  Just about says it all!<br /><br />This album plays like a pop rock symphony.  I didn't buy it because of their arena show.  I bought it because I already owned all the ELO to date and I figued this one was going to be great too.  The sad part is that ELO seemed to fall apart after this album; it just wasn't the same after this.  All they had worked for throughout the 70's led up to this great work.<br /><br />Finally, isn't it time for a 30th anniversary edition?  Remastered with some extra stuff maybe?  How about a little tiny cardboard cut-out spaceship?
1592401791|5.0|I always wondered what it was like in the recording studio when the Beatles created all those pop masterpieces. Well, now I know. Told from an engineer's perspective, we learn countless fascinating facts about the sessions that changed pop music forever. Paul staying long after everyone else left, sitting alone in the studio until his bass parts on Seargant Pepper were absolutely perfect (I always loved the bass work on Pepper, and now I know why it was so good). John tripping his brains out in the studio and accomplishing absolutely nothing that night, thus exploding the dearly-held 60's myth that acid helps the creative process. I could go on and on... this book is great.
B00005JP5J|5.0|A \\"dysfunctional\\" family goes on a road trip from New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California, so that the daughter, about eleven, can enter Little Miss Sunshine. The family members include the sweet, innocent daughter who adores her grandfather; the grandfather, a sometimes bitter World War II vet with a penchant for lasciviousness but who has a tender heart benath his prickly, surly manner; a disaffected teenage son who reads Nietzsche and refuses to speak because he hates his family; the rattled mother who spends all her time trying to keep the family chaos under control; a down-on-his-luck father, who battling with finances, tries to lift himself and his family with a self-help book and cheery bromides that feebly cushion his fall to despair; an uncle who, scorned by his lover and losing his professorial job, fails in his bid to commit suicide. As this ragtag team of misfits travels to California, they deal with their personality clashes and fall into one comic mishap after another.<br /><br />The theme of this film is that American's have a very adolescent, immature notion of success, which is all or nothing. We must, the film shows us, reject society's superficial notions of being a \\"winner\\" and carve out our own niche by finding out what we really love as we remain indifferent to society's meretricious definitions of glamour and success. This screwball comedy is not your cynical life is hell with no redemption variety. Rather, Little Miss Sunshine has a moral--that there is redemption if we see how ridiculous and immature our definitions of success are. The film does a great job of skewering society's loathsome notions of being a \\"winner,\\" be it a beauty contest winner or any other lame cultural icon.
0385509456|5.0|I'm rather shocked by some of the negative reviews of this book--- I won't go into the plot, as it were, as it's detailed elsewhere--- but it strikes me that those who find the book fascinating are people who can appreciate a narrative for its language, perspective, and ability to open one's mind.  I fear that, just because it's a short book, some readers thought it would be an easy read.  It's not a classic mystery, it doesn't have a classic plot--- but it's a remarkable feat of writing in that the author could so totally convey the thoughts and viewpoints of an autistic adolescent.  As for its use of profanity--- honestly, I can't even recall it; it's simply part of the environment.  Christopher reports exactly what he hears--- that's the point--- he's unable to edit, screen or interpret symbols around him, whether they are facial expressions or colloquial expressions.  I consider this an extraordinary piece of writing, and can't recommend it highly enough for readers who will appreciate what it offers.  Nancy Drew it ain't.
B000002H33|5.0|\\"Master of Puppets\\" in undoubtedly one of the greatest recordings of all time.  In my opinion, \\"Master\\" has one of the greatest sounding guitar tones that I have ever heard and if you want to talk about tight and precise playing then this is the album to talk about!  \\"Master\\" is one of the best metal albums ever and is in my top ten of most awesome releases ever.  Sadly, it was Cliff Burton's last album with Metallica.  He was  killed in a tour bus accident while in Europe in 1986 and never lived to see the success that Metallica had attained later in thier career.  Who knows what they would have sounded like had Cliff lived.  All I can say is that it totally screwed up the band and they took it real hard when he died.  Metallica moved on though.  These days though, I think Metallica is a lost soul of a band and they will never be able to top \\"Master of Puppets\\" both in songwriting and shear brutality.  Cliff wrote some of the stuff on \\"Master\\" such as the beginning of \\"Damage Inc.\\" and parts of the instrumental of \\"Orion\\".  If you buy any album from the 80's, as far as metal goes, \\"Master of Puppets\\" fits nicely with Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" and Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells But Who's Buying?\\".  Metallica's third cd is a must have.  Buy it if you don't have it by now.  It is essential.
B000A59PMO|5.0|If you've seen this show, then you know you have to buy the DVDs, there is no other sensible solution.  If you haven't seen the show, then if you like smart snarky banter with a touch of dark and completely engrossing mysteries mixed with humor and hot cast, then you must buy these DVDs.   <br /> <br />I know, I know, you want to know how the extras are before you make this purchase.  Okay I'm going to be honest, they totally suck.  There are 20 minutes of deleted scenes including extra a more extended version with explanation of the mystery involving the Russian woman searching for her true love.  But all in all you'll be left wanting more.  <br /> <br />Good thing the show is so addicting and fabulous that you'll love watching the episodes over and over again.

0446677450|5.0|This is a great book for those dissatisfied with their current financial situation.  It is a book on ideas to give a different perspective.  I am looking forward to reading more of his books and praying for specifics for my life.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|The quality is perfect, I couldn't be happier. The extras are nice, and quite long so it's not a waste of money in any regard. I haven't watched the movie yet, but I know it's high quality from what I have seen. This is a must have for any anime fan, as well as any Final Fantasy fan.
0763621803|5.0|I just love Charlie & Lola!  This is a great book!  Charlie is such a lovely big brother and reminds me so much of several of the children I cared for when I lived in England.  Lola is also delightful, and 'full of beans' as they say on that side of the pond.  There's no need for Supernanny with these two, they are sweet, respectful, charming, imaginative and delightful.<br /><br />My 19 month old daughter doesn't watch the television version, but is always asking me to read this book and several of the other C&L books to her.  The other day she met a little boy at the playground with this book, it was the Korean version, but boy did she recognize it!  I am looking foward to buying the DVD's for my little girl for Christmas.<br /><br />I will be first in line for any more of these wonderful stories.
B000G75AE8|3.0|Slayer's newest offering is somewhat of a mediocre effort after one of thier best albums \\"GOD HATES US ALL\\".  I'm not saying that it is bad but, it's not as good as GHUA.  I knew that Slayer was going to have a hard time topping the last release.  However, the songs offer a bit of different formula.  Don't be worried though.  Slayer still has all the crazy lead guitars and mayhemic riffs from King and Hanneman that we all love and having Dave Lombardo back is a definte treat.  Double bass all the way!!!  Tom Aryra I think is starting to show his age just a little bit.  I can tell from his voice.  Oh, it still sounds like good 'ol Tom but, you can tell he is getting older.  If I am not mistaken, I believe he is in his forties now as well as the rest of the boys.  As far as the songs go, they are tight and solid but, so far I have only latched onto a couple of the tunes at this time.  Whereas with GHUA, I instantly liked the whole album.  \\"Christ Illusion\\" also brings the return of something that Slayer was always known for...satanic lyrics.  During the last couple of albums Slayer dealt more with real-life and not so much heaven and hell type stuff.  Lyrically, they touch on the reality of life and the horrors of hell on this new album.  If your'e in a band like Slayer, you can't be singing about love and flowers, right?  All in all \\"Christ Illusion\\" is a good, tight release and I recommend it to anyone who is into real heavy metal.
B000EULJLU|3.0|It's all been said in these reviews, so I'll keep this brief. <br /> <br />Whereas in previous releases, Tool always seeemed to explore new territory and experiment a bit more, 10,000 Days sounds much like their past work. This is not a bad thing, and I'm not disappointed about it, as I love all of their work, but I was a bit surprised. Some of it sounded so familiar that I found myself anticipating lyrics or riffs from their other songs. <br /> <br />The album as a whole is fantastic, and like most of their later work, it's meant to be listened to in its entirety. This is not a quick-drive-across-town-listening CD. <br /> <br />Also like most of their previous albums, the packaging and artwork alone are worth the price of the album.  <br /> <br />It's a Sony disc, so of course, typical fair use types of things like ripping the songs to listen to while at your PC are out. Tsk tsk. Can someone deliver a clue to Sony and the recording industry?
B000002UE9|3.0|Back in the '80s, Thrashers had mortal enemies in the form of Glam Rockers, and one of the biggest and easiest targets was Poison. Hairspray, make up, spandex and a penchant for happy Pop songs mislabeled Metal by a clueless press made Poison cannon fodder for the bullet belt, mullet and obscenely tight jeans brigade. Poison didn't really give a damn, just carrying on their merry way, and selling millions of records. <br /> <br />`Open Up And Say...Ahh!' is a good exercise in the art of filler songs. Filler songs are like those gap filler products you can buy for fixing cracks in your walls - they match the wallpaper and you don't really notice them. There were four singles released from this album, a 40 percent strike rate for a ten song album and while they were all reasonably successful, the rest was filler, and pretty bloody bland and formless filler at that. <br /> <br />First though, the good bits. \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" is the power ballad which all other power ballads aspire to be. It is weepy, cheesy and catchy, and surprisingly wasn't written by Willie Nelson. It has a solo to die for, and to cry to, making a nonsense of all the criticism levelled at guitarist CC DeVille's playing ability. This is a white trash anthem to broken hearts and lost loves, perfect for singing with newly found beer buddies. <br /> <br />\\"Your Mamma Don't Dance\\" is an ancient Kenny Loggins song given the Glam treatment. It's harmless Poppy nonsense, about teen antics and a girlfriend's uncool parents. \\"Nothin' But A Good Time\\" is an '80s version of the same song, but the teens have grown up, and want a weekend escape from the daily grind of life. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is a too cheerful treatment of the pitfalls of a small town girl trying to make it in the big city. These four songs have more hooks than a fishing tackle shop and more Pop melodies than the Spice Girls mustered in an entire career. Poison always knew their musical limitations, and pushed their abilities right to the limit. Bret Michaels might not have had the strongest voice in the Glam scene, but he knew it, and made the most of what talent he did have. <br /> <br />And then, the filler. Oh dear...but you can hardly blame the poor wee Poison boys, because all their heroes had made careers of padding out a couple of songs and calling it an album. Just check out pretty much any studio album by Kiss or Van Halen or even Mötley Crüe, and you'll find half-hearted, underdone tracks aplenty. The song titles give it away- \\"Back To The Rocking Horse\\", \\"Look But You Can't Touch\\", and \\"Love On The Rocks\\" don't promise much, and deliver exactly that. There's the odd decent moment, like a fun melody in the chorus of \\"Look But You Can't Touch\\", but moments don't make songs. Poison manage to hit every cliché listed in the 1980s Glam Rock handbook, and add a few of their own. None of it is terribly cerebral, but then it's not supposed to be. <br /> <br />The vinyl album version of `Open Up And Say...Ahh!' had a brilliant gimmick on the cover, in the form of a three dimensional tongue stuck to the painted up cat woman on the album cover. Looking back now, the cover is somewhat ridiculous and over the top, but that matched Poison's music, and the lifestyle provided by a mega-million selling album. CC DeVille's heroin addiction and Bret Michael's appetite for shagging models and groupies are both well documented, and perhaps those excesses stopped the band ever reaching the same heights again. `Open Up And Say...Ahh!' remains a dirty little secret, kept in the closet by many a Rocker who steadfastly denies ever owning it.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Watched this many times on cable before buying the DVD from Amazon.  My husband and I really like this movie.
0440180295|5.0|What the hell is this book?!?!  What the hell does it mean?!?!  Okay, I think I know.  No, I don't!  Maybe I'll just read the back cover again.  NO..........I can't give in!  What does it mean to me?  Highly unconventional.  Three sub-plots rolled into one?  Time travel?  Non-formulaic structure?  I can't think straight.  I've never read a book twice before, but I have to read this one again.  Oh God, I'm freakin' out! (Deep breath)........Okay, so anyway.  If you like conventional stories, where you're just being dictated to throughout the entire book, this novel is not for you.  Actually, it is for you!  It will melt your brain and throw you into such a paradigm shift you'll get whiplash.  Everyone should read this book.  It should be required reading in high-school, hell, pre-school!  It will make you think, so BEWARE!
B000FVQM2Y|3.0|This movie has a dark tone to it. It is initially very difficult to make sense of what is happening, but it all comes together very deliberately and very slowly. The characters, especially the main character, Brendan, and his friend and confidant, Brain, use a very strange slang to communicate. It's difficult to follow, but interesting. The whole time I was watching, I was trying to find out what was going on with this subculture that seemed to exist beneath the veneer of a high school. There grows a feeling of urgency in Brendan's situation, although we're not exactly sure what that is just yet... He's trying to do something - and given his actions - it must be something important. It was somewhat suspenseful and interesting enough to keep me watching. The characters are also fairly interesting, even if only in their mysteriousness. Tug, who is muscle for \\"The Pin\\", is a crazy MF'er and helps to make the story more edgy with his outbursts of violence and his lack of attempt to control them.  <br /> <br />This is a pretty good flick. I enjoyed the plot and how it all played out. It was better than expected. <br />
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I don't normally like \\"score\\" albums, but the music on this CD is so good that even my hip 8 year old likes it.  I have listened to it no less than 20 times and I find it gets better each and every time.   <br /> <br />Way better than the first album!
0060825219|1.0|Depiste my previous readings of his novels - alchemist and pilgrimage, this one - zaihr - seems like a manual for yoga or soap opera that never finishes, but dragging the story...  I am disappointed this novel.  In addition, his view contrary to his earlier novel seemed have changed quite a bit.  One summary, I have wasted my money in purchasing this book.
038533348X|4.0|Okay, I would like to give it 5-stars!  What was I thinking, I can't change it now?!?!  A truly entertaining, and somewhat frightening book.  I don't like to write long reviews, so I'll get right to it.  If you enjoyed Slaughterhouse-Five, you'll most certainly enjoy this novel.  Cat's Cradle is more accessible, and not as outrageous as Slaughterhouse (which I enjoyed a little more).  What can be said about Vonnegut that hasn't already been said.  He was ahead of his time in thumbing his nose at the \\"powers-that-be\\".  Do yourself a favor and read this book........NOW!
B000F7CMRM|5.0|The movie ilustrates the reality of what goes behind the scene in today's complex world of politics and nation building. A must see movie for anyone who wants to understand the reality of what goes in the Middle East.
B000G759LW|4.0|For someone that never buys pop, I have always respected the fact that Christina can REALLY sing and that along with Mariah Carey makes me veer into the pop world every now and then. I appreciate someone that really knows how to belt out a tune in a sea of wanna be singers. Christina has a lot of soul and for people that think she's like other blonde pop stars they will be pleasantly suprised by the old school soul and r&b sound she has. Her first one was the same way, you thought to yourself... hmmm I didn't expect that. She delivers a smooth album with heck a voice. Not too many others can match her all around talent.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|I enjoyed Dark Water.  It's far from the typical slasher and pop-up horror movie.  I also enjoyed the departure from the typical dark mansion horror genre.  The setting is Roosevelt Island in NYC, and many of the creepy scenes are played out in the daytime.  Connelly is very effective as the paranoid mother dealing with a leaky apartment, a psychologically abusive ex-husband, a troubled daughter, and her own dysfunctional family history.  John C. Reilly plays against type as a slightly effeminate and hostile real estate agent.  Tim Roth is something of a hero as Connelly's lawyer, but even he can't be fully trusted.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|I've loved this movie since I saw it in the theaters as a young adult. It truely captured, for me, the action of Formula 1 (F1) racing. In the U.S. we got one maybe two F1 races on TV a year on Wide World of Sports with Jackie Stewart's brogue putting you in the racecar with the driver. This movie does the same. It has action shots so well spliced together as to make you lean with the actors as they pilot the cars around the most famous tracks in F1 history.  <br />Its great to see two of my favorite actors, James Garner and Yves Montand, doing their own driving. <br />
B000FFJYCU|5.0|ALTHOUGH THE DIALOG SEES SOMEWHAT DATED BY TODAYS MOVIE STANDARDS,THE RACING SEQUENCES ARE STILL THE BEST. IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THIS MOVIE COULD EVEN BE MADE TODAY. HAVING GROWN UP IN THE 60'S FOLLOWING F-1 RACING, GRAND PRIX REALLY GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT RACING USED TO BE ABOUT. RACING! NOT JUST SPONCERS.THE MOVIE SOUND TRACK , ALONG WITH THE SPLIT SCREENS STILL WORKS FOR ME. HEY, BACK THEN YOU COULD MAKE A MOVE WITHOUT FOUR LETTER WORDS.GREAT STORY AND GREAT CAST
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Any time a movie is made based on a television series, the production faces an additional dilemma: how to bring new viewers up to speed without boring series fans to tears. \\"Serenity\\" manages to do a fine job, those new to the Firefly saga quickly learn the essential backstory while hardcore fans are still entertained during the formative part of the film. This is no mean feat, given the size of the ensemble cast. <br /> <br />The element that sets this movie apart from all the other tales of space and sci-fi on film is the acting. Taking the well-formed and interesting characters created by Whedon, the cast really makes them appealing and identifiable. You feel like you actually known these people and you understand their actions and emotions. Hopefully the surviving cast will have the opportunity to reprise their roles in a sequel or two or three. Much like a couple of other space flick franchises, only better. Much, much better.
B000B5UL7G|4.0|Even among those that don't consider themselves fans, you can usually still find a grudging acceptance of the fact that Robbie Williams is a remarkably gifted entertainer. Press these same folks further, however, and you'd probably find very few that would consider his songwriting output to be of any great worth. True, he does have the proven ability to pump out huge, lighter-waving hits like `Angels' or `Better Man', but generally, his music is perceived as being a bit half-hearted, a bit phoned-in, a bit meat and potatoes.  For the last 10 years this has been my line of thinking too. OK, admittedly I'm quite partial to `Lazy Days' and `No Regrets' - but other than that - the music of Robbie Williams occupies very little of my headspace. So honestly, I'm as surprised as anyone to have discovered that the latest Robbie Williams album is actually really, really, tremendously good.<br /><br />Traditionally, Williams isn't really seen as an `album artist' but he's gone a long way to disproving that theory here. On Intensive Care he sounds invigorated and purposeful - a man with something to say and plenty to prove.  There's a sense of urgency to this new material that wasn't really present in earlier albums. Choruses soar, hooks surprise, and melodies beguile, and paired together with Williams' witty, knowing lyrics, we have the genuine recipe for a very good pop album indeed. First play through, Intensive Care sounded promising, second play through I was really beginning to feel it, third play through - I was totally sold.<br /><br />To be sure, the best thrills reside in the first half of Intensive Care, with one good song after another, culminating in the absolutely glorious ballad `Advertising Space'. Tracks 1 through 6, it must be said, are the very definition of perfect-pop. But there is still plenty of quality left over for the second half.  Most notably on `The Trouble With Me' and the lovely, understated album closer `King Of Bloke And Bird'. Occasionally in the latter half Williams does revert back to more piffling fare like `Your Gay Friend' or `A Place To Crash', but even these songs aren't entirely without their charms - with the former even displaying some nice Johnny Marr-style guitar licks.<br /><br />Poor Robbie has suffered a fair amount of backlash over the years. Certainly, he hasn't always helped his own cause at times.  But to his credit, Williams has soldiered on, and with the help of new songwriting partner Stephen Duffy, he's turned in an album full of beauty, conviction and hard-won experience.Williams does revert back to more piffling fare like `Your Gay Friend' or `A Place To Crash', but even these songs aren't entirely without their charms - with the former even displaying some nice Johnny Marr-style guitar licks.

B00001QEE9|5.0|Made back when Disney made truely great animated films. I love the old Disney stuff and Pinocchio is one of the best. Disney was and is the king of this film genre, especially back when this one was made. NO animation done today rivals the Disney cartoons of the era this film was made. Warner Brothers, Dreamworks, Pixar and any of the other animation studios of today will never touch the quality and imagination of early Disney films. I don't like computer animation, so maybe I'm biased in that respect. This film is pure art.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Just watched this on a friend's 60 inch HD TV. Great remastering job, very good sound. Much better picture than the VHS version, although that was nicely done as well. Perhaps the most spectacular movie footage of racing ever shot, using period Formula 2 cars driven by period Formula 1 drivers. James Garner drove his own car; reports are that he was competitive with the professional drivers. Movie is a bit slow in spots covering budding love, but Garner puts in a solid performance- I'm not convinced McQueen would have made the picture better, as some allege.
0385336691|5.0|In my opinion \\"The Hard Way\\" is the best Lee Child book yet.  I highly recomend it.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Lord knows what bug Alan Moore has up his bum, but having read the COMIC BOOK and seen the film, I don't get what the brouhaha is all about. He and David Llyod collaborated on a COMIC BOOK, not Moby Dick. If there were concerns on an artistic front, Lloyd would be the one, but this is essentially a COMIC BOOK story fleshed out with live actors and special effects and it's all extremely well done and true to the source, i.e. a COMIC BOOK.  <br />As a movie, it's a lot of fun to watch, and makes a lot more sense than the soft-headed geeky-theory of The Matrix trilogy. It's all derived from Orwell, of course, but the effects are good, the acting is over-the-top without resorting to Star Wars platitudes or Johnny Depp ham-fisting, and there is a point to the story, and given the political climate in the world today, it is hardly far-fetched. There is a fair amount of ironic US-bashing, well deserved and on target, and the England on offer here is Margaret Thatcher's wet dream. That may tell you a little bit about the times in which the story was conceived, but to everyone's credit, it is told crisply as though it were a straight narravtive. That helps enormously in a film. The director got the point of letting the graphics help tell the story and set the tone. Nothing is gratuitous, and that's notable all in its own right. <br />My quibbles with the film are slight: sound balance is way off: Hugo Weaving's dialogue is in such hushed tones that I was constantly adjusting the volume to hear him recite Shakespeare, then backing it down for the explosions. For that matter, it may not even be Weaving behind the mask. His voice over might well have been phoned in. V nods toward Eavey or one of the other characters, and there are action sequences, but nothing to suggest that Weaving is actually there. Still, it's a good film. <br />The extras are for the geeks. <br />I go back to the Moore dust-up. My guess is he's a stereo-typical art student who wants to be contrary for thesake of being contrary. I suspect it's all contrived anyway. As David Lloyd opined: if he is that upset, give back the check. <br />For everyone else, enjoy the film, it's a good story that ought to be told in these times. <br />
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Some say great dialog, others say crappy dialog disguised as great dialog...  I say that although the words occasionally felt transparent or forced, overall it worked.  The dialog made sense within the world of the film because that world is, as everyone has said, high school layered with Casablanca.  This movie is an excellent effort in an unusual direction.  The acting is surprisingly good, the characters are intelligent, and for the most part they're unusually mature for teenage characters in an American movie. The plot is dense and twisted enough to hold my interest.  Not a perfect movie, but a great one.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Described as \\"The X Files Meets Route 66\\", Supernatural came along last fall on the WB and quickly became the one bright spot for new programming. Feeling the withdrawl of no more \\"Buffy\\" or \\"Angel\\", this new show helps fill in that void, if not totally making up for it. Better than expected for this type of show on a network like WB, Supernatural is a tight and well shot show that is a little \\"mini horror movie\\" every week, but having it's own mythology and season story arc. The show's weekly stories delve into folklore and famous urban legends. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki play Dean and Sam Winchester, brothers who drive across the country tracking down supernatural happening and beings and helping people. They have their own personal motives that drive them that include horrible tragedies that have happened to them both and their family. Like Mulder who is searching for his sister, the boys are searching for their father. \\"Pilot\\" is an exceptionally well done first episode that sets everything up very nicely. Other top highlights featured in the debut season include \\"Bloody Mary\\", where the brothers confront that famous legend about a ghostly apparition in mirrors. \\"Hook Man\\" puts a new and modern spin on the 'ol crazy killer with a hook hand at lovers lane tale and pulls it off. Ackles gets to show off his acting chops in the shape shifting episode \\"Skin\\". The boys' tragic past comes back to haunt them in the exceptional \\"Home\\", one of the first season's best episodes. \\"Asylum\\" is one of the top best as the brothers try to explore strange things going on in an abandoned asylum. \\"Scarecrow\\" is a wonderful little thrill ride about strange cititzens and their ties to a murderous scarecrow. Buffy's Julie Benz(Darla)appears in \\"Faith\\". Another alum of the Joss Whedon universe, Angel's Amy Acker, appears in \\"Dead In The Water\\". \\"Hell House\\" is a lot of fun and has a funny reference to Buffy, and vampires themselves pop up in \\"Dead Man's Blood\\". The two brothers are the only regulars on the show, and they carry the series very nicely. Ackles is the real star of the show. His Dean character is complex with a great sense of humor and cockiness. Padalecki's Sam is a little more dour who barely cracks a smile. The show's look is sometimes light, but a lot of the time dark and gritty. It's tone is just right, and it's production values are top notch. One of the best aspects of the show is it's kickin' classic rock soundtrack. What's not to love?. Well, \\"Bugs\\" for one, but that's about it. Supernatural is a richly layered and conceived series that could have a long and successful run. The writing is wonderful, the ideas are fresh and inventive, and the two leads can carry the show without any other regulars. The brother relationship is strong at times and fragile the next. It's just as much about sibling rivalry as it is about things that go bump in the night. It has all the right makings for a cult hit. Let's hope The CW knows they have a good thing and treat it right. Supernatural is nothing but fun entertainment from start to finish.
B000GRUMQ4|5.0|I had been a little skeptical at first the night I decided to go ahead and watch \\"Poseidon\\"...man am I glad I did.<br /><br />Although many claimed it \\"sunk\\" at the box-office, no pun intended (well...okay, maybe it's a little intended), I thought this film was truly amazing. To be honest, I'm a little shocked it was only rated PG13. According to amazon, it received this rating due to prolonged sequences of disaster and peril. They were not wrong. I'll say this much...get used to seeing *a lot* of dead bodies. Dead bodies everywhere. Floating, impaled, burned, charred, crushed...you name it. I wonder how many extras it took to get that many dead bodies, or do you think they just cycled through the same people?<br /><br />Anyway, a QUICK SYNOPSIS: As hundreds of people gather aboard an enormous luxury cruise liner in celebration of New Years, a HUGE wave (can't stress that enough) catches the revelers off guard and completely capsizes the gigantic vessel, killing a good 3/4 of the people aboard in a matter of minutes. Though the ship is, technically, upside-down, it is still generally floating on the ocean surface...but sinking slowly. There is one large ballroom full of people who mostly survive (for the time being), in addition to a few stragglers from another part of the ship. After assessing the situation, a very sexy man named Dylan (Josh Lucas) decides to take matters into his own hands and find a way off the ship instead of waiting helplessly for rescue. He takes a few people with him, and together they fight their way through the dangers and perils of the capsized ship in a desperate attempt to reach the top...and escape.<br /><br />This film is exciting, suspenseful, and ACTION PACKED. It also doesn't hurt to have Josh Lucas there...who is wet most of the time (woo-hoo for the ladies out there).<br /><br />One good thing is that they don't make you wait too long for the awesome action (and the incredible wave sequence). The film does a good job of introducing you to the main characters, giving you a feel for who they are, what kind of people they are, and the type of relationship they have with one another, in a quick, thorough, and timely manner. They don't mess around with tedious, boring exposition. They work the exposition in when you need it, and let the action flow when you don't.<br /><br />The one critique that I might have to give this film is the lack of proper closure at the end. I don't want to give too much away, but lets just say you are left wanting a *little* more. But thats okay. It's still one hell of a ride!iving you a feel for who they are, what kind of people they are, and the type of relationship they have with one another, in a quick, thorough, and timely manner.

B000FGGE68|3.0|You know, had this film had a better scriptwriter, who didn't simply repeat bad comic or game lines for the characters but created taut, snappy dialogue and more complex interplay, this could have been a superb film.<br /><br />The look of it is extremely interesting. The use of Shanghai for the city of the future was marvellous, and I enjoyed the comic-ised  palette and the use of CGI to recreate the graphic novel/game appearance. The martial arts style was fascinating, and Milla Jovovich is certainly stunning.<br /><br />But character depth, interplay and plot have been discarded as unimportant in this movie. None of the characters has anything interesting to say - it's all very much \\"this is a computer game and no one expects Shakespeare\\"-style dialogue. The motivations of the characters are often inexplicable. The actual danger of this disease of the haemophages is never explained. How the boy (named Six - a clone of a cartoon-style villain) is supposed to be activated to act as a weapon is never explained. The motivation for the villain is frankly ludicrous. And the endless and inevitable and unstoppable killing routine of Violet herself is fun, but let's face it - ridiculous.<br /><br />One has to suspend disbelief to enjoy the film. I did so willingly - but even so, the plot problems were gaping. I think it's time that directors of this style of movie stopped thinking viewers will not notice the plot problems and lack of depth in the characters. Yes, no doubt it's fun for a director to bring a comic book to life, but really, really, REALLY... directors and scriptwriters have got to get beyond the \\"oh, isn't it fun - we're creating dialogue just like a comic book!\\" stage. It isn't fun for the audience. There is a difference between comic books and films, and part of the difference is in the expectation of the dialogue and the richness of characters.<br /><br />By all means, let the look of this style of film continue to utilise the stark and bright colours of the graphic novel/game. But the stereotypical characters are far too obvious when transported from comic book to screen. FAR too obvious. Detailed work needs to be done by a real scriptwriter who doesn't mind creating more realistic characters with deeper functionality than a mere imitation of their comic book counterpart.<br /><br />The crew obviously enjoyed working on this film, particularly with all the special effects. They clearly did not think in terms of a great plot, but in terms of \\"wow, we have a fantastic motorcycle sequence going along the SIDE of buildings!\\" or \\"wow, we have Violet fighting twenty armoured men!\\" or \\"wow, doesn't Milla look beautiful in these shots?\\" and so on. Mm-hmm. Ho hum, I'm afraid. These sequences are simply UNIMPORTANT to making the film itself great. They don't do it. They cannot and never will take the place of a truly good plot.<br /><br />So many things didn't make sense. Why was Six thought to be dead if he wasn't? Why did Violet's teardrop make him not dead? Why did she know this? Why did she risk her life for him when, for all she knew, merely touching the boy would result in instant annihilation of all her people? Why did she keep keep spouting appallingly bad lines about how dangerous and deadly a killer she is? (This struck such a jarring note...) Why was she able to fool all the tests when she was pretending to a courier? How did she slaughter all of the guards she confronted, even when overcome by completely overwhelming odds? (In true comic-book style, she was supposed to be invincible, but the scriptwriter and director were clearly trying to make Violet \\"real\\"... They've forgotten \\"real\\" only works when overwhelming odds aren't included all the time in a completely unrealistic way.)<br /><br />I do think the casting of Milla Jovovich was right for the role, and she's a good actress. She did the best she could with this role. The fault was in the writing.<br /><br />In these terms, \\"Ultraviolet\\" was a disappointment. \\"Equilibrium\\", also a fantasy film with a super-hero type of character, was amazingly good, and featured not only a powerhouse performance from Christian Bale, but had a story that made sense. It had character dynamics that were superb. It also had an incredibly moving moment - that instant when Bale's character hears the music of Beethoven for the first time while no longer on his emotion-suppressing medication, and tears of astonishment and wonder at the beauty of it trickle from his eyes. Now THAT worked...<br /><br />I hope the director of this film will tackle that sort of film again, and will choose a scriptwriter who can create emotionally powerful moments like that, as well as create characters that have real depth, not pseudo-depth as I'm afraid the character of Ultraviolet had.<br /><br />Recommended with caveats, mainly for the look of it, and for those who enjoy the sight of an unstoppable but unrealistic woman defeating anyone who comes against her or stands in her way. Do not watch if you want a genuinely gripping plot or believable characters.a disappointment. \\"Equilibrium\\", also a fantasy film with a super-hero type of character, was amazingly good, and featured not only a powerhouse performance from Christian Bale, but had a story that made sense.

6304698798|4.0|I hate to see \\"wanton killing\\" in movies.  There's too much killing in this film as there is too much killing for real in the world. Other than the excessive killing, this is an excellent motion picture.<br /><br />Among my favorite scenes is the \\"Civil War\\" sequence in which the Union captain tells \\"the good guy\\" and \\"the ugly guy\\" that his troops are confronting the Southern Troops at this place in the river because there is a bridge there.  If the bridge weren't there the two sides would disperse thus saving useless carnage on both sides.  So, of course you guessed it, the \\"good guy\\" and the \\"ugly guy\\" decide to blow up the bridge so the two armies can leave the area thus leaving the \\"the good guy\\" and \\"the ugly guy\\" free reign to look for the gold.  The bridge is blown up and the two armies leave...thus saving the lives of many men.  It's a beautiful sequence.<br /><br />Yes, be prepared for alot of \\"shooting\\" and \\"killing\\" during most of the film but see this masterpiece just the same!  Recommended<br /><br />Afterthought:  If I had been the director of this film, or of other films in which people are shot and killed, I think I'd consider using a technique that was twice actually used in this film:  At a certain point twice in the movie,  Clint Eastwood shoots at \\"townspeople\\"----What was depicted was Eastwood \\"shooting off their hats\\" (bang! bang! bang!)instead of killing them.  Perhaps this same \\"technique\\" of \\"shooting off hats\\" in place of plugging the people full of lead and watching them die in agony could have diminished the \\"killing sprees\\" in the film for the sake of \\"sensitive folk\\" possibly like you and me who dislike seeing people getting drilled with bullets and dying in agony with their blood all over the place!  Good idea?  :o) Email  boland7214@aol.co
B00005JP5J|5.0|Prepare to laugh, and prepare yourself to laugh at things that make you squirm.  The cast is excellent.  I came away from the movie thinking that the love of a family who accepts you for exactly who you are will get you through the worst of times, and that little girl beauty pageants are CREEPY.  That broken horn on the VW Bus is still making me laugh today.  Best comedy I've seen in a long while.
0802130208|3.0|The best thing about Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, is its protagonist and the worse thing about the book is every scene he is not in.  Ignatius Reilly is an ingenuous literary creation who is extremely entertaining in his day-to-day bumbling adventures.  Part sloth, part eccentric prude, he is all laughs as a 30 year old purveyor of haughty perceptions that form from his particularly close minded \\"worldview\\".  The way he interacts with the local denizens is consistently funny and the characters of New Orleans's French Quarter provide a contrasting opinion to Ignatius' perceived reality.  We observe Ignatius as he works (and gets fired) from a pants factory, to working as a hot dog vendor (eating more than he sells) meanwhile having to deal with his fed up mother (with whom he still lives) and corresponding with the polar opposite and sexually adventurous Myrna Minkoff (some of the funniest sections in the book.) <br /> <br />Unfortunately the rest of the book didn't do it for me.  There are various other plot lines and characters that hardly involve Ignatius and they just weren't interesting to me at all.  Ignatius steals the book completely and although they might have been necessary for plot reasons, I had to force myself through them, often looking ahead to see how much longer they were.  Toole really hit gold with Ignatius and everyone else seemed boring in comparison and it really hurt my overall impression of the book. <br /> <br />It's also worth taking a look at the forward and learning a bit about the author and the story of the manuscript.  Apparently Toole's mother brought in novel to a publisher after her son's suicide in his early 30's.  Also Toole had the same occupations as Ignatius so I wonder how autobiographical his protagonist was. <br /> <br />This book has earned a cult following since its publication and rave reviews by many.  This book earned Toole posthumous win of the Pulitzer for fiction in 1981.  This book is appropriate for older highschool kids and up as it does contain explicit sexual innuendoes and some racial themes. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  An entertaining book that is plagued by catastrophic unevenness.  I actually recommend trying it out to page 100 (1/4 of the book) and going from there.
0743455967|5.0|This book is tricky. Stephen says: \\"There are no through lines in this book, so don't look for one\\" but that's not necessarily true. There is. Stephen tells the reader/ listener about his childhood \\"events\\" (these \\"events\\" become the sources for his various works of fiction), then after he tells us of his childhood, Stephen goes into a section called, \\"Tool Box.\\" This section gives the reader/ listener the rudiments needed if one should choose to become a writer. Basically, the very least one should know. There's not much more than what I have mentioned, because Stephen believes (as do I) that reading and writing are the only avenues to take if you want to improve your writing chops. And as a side note, I bought both the book and CD set. The CD set is awesome. There's nothing better than hearing Stephen talk about writing. Could you imagine what a course like this would cost if Stephen ever chose to teach one?
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Ang Lee's film is groundbreaking in that it is a mainstream movie that portrays passion between two men.  The story begins when two farm boys, Ennis and Jack, meet while herding sheep on isolated Brokeback Mountain.  The job is for the summer and they must camp out with the sheep.  They share the stories of their love deprived  childhoods and on a cold night they end up sharing a tent.  They make love and develop a passionate bond.  Taciturn Ennis is nearly incapable of revealing, let alone talking, about his feelings to the more demonstrative Jack.<br /><br />Over the next twenty years or so, Jack and Ennis meet for fishing trips and to renew their passion.  Both are married with children in their attempts to fit in to the demands of culture. Jack is able to express his dissatisfaction with being apart from his true love and repeatedly suggests that he and Ennis get a ranch together.  Ennis is barely able to talk about this, let alone allow himself to be with Jack.<br /><br />This film creates an atmosphere of love and longing, while unflinchingly showing the lack of acceptance by mainstream culture of alternate lifestyles.  The scenic splendour of nature is filmed with haunting clarity.  This provides an element of nature, almost as another character in the film, acting as a neutral witness to human passion.  Gyllenhaal and Ledger are touching and beautiful in their roles.  The supporting actresses playing their wives, Michelle Williams and Ann Hathaway, provide accurate and devastating performances.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is one of the few films that all people find a masterpiece no matter their race, age, or sex. It seems to be able to touch the hearts and minds of all those that view it. It has the touch of a true cinematic artist, Akira Kurosawa. Any part of it would be impressive, but the combination of great story, amazing cinematography, superb acting, and masterful direction make it one of the finest movies you will ever see. For years it was hard to get on video and those that had been lucky enough to catch on television became immediate fans. I am happy to say this DVD is excellent and the quality of the picture and sound make it a must have. The price may seem a little high but for one of the finest works of the last century, you will not regret the cost.<br /><br />Most people have seen \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" which was based on \\"Seven Samurai\\". This should give you an idea of what to expect as far as the overall story. The difference is it takes place in feudal Japan and instead of gunfighters they are Samurai. A poor farming village is invaded by bandits that are mostly made up of out of work soldiers looking for food. The Samurai on the other hand are elite soldiers that were bodyguards to warlords previously and they too are now unemployed since the war is over. Their honor is one of their highest attributes. A group of farmers from the village try to hire four Samurai based on instructions from the village patriarch to help them fight the bandits. What transpires is amazing. I have been a long time fan of this movie. Considering when it was made I think if you have any appreciation of the industry you have to realize this was a true pioneer of the genre. I highly recommend this movie.

1567184855|5.0|My husband recently passed away and this book provided insight and comfort into what he must be experiencing.  It is one thing to say \\"He's in a better place\\", but quite another to have information on what is actually happening to him in that better place.   Dr. Newton also confirms my beliefs that we plan our lives before we get here down to minute details on who we will meet when.
B000G759LW|1.0|Like most of my reviews, I do not feel the need to review each and every song in depth. All I need to do is tell you what I think, then let you decide whether or not I'm right. Recently, I have been bombarded with \\"praise\\" for Christina's return to music. Critics claiming her to be the best vocalist in America, and the majority of people considering this legitimate, worthwhile music.  <br /> <br />First of all, as for Christina being the best vocalist in America, I disagree. Not one of the tracks on this CD has a single moment in which Christina actually has control over her voice. Even the shortest phrases are filled with a more than plentiful amount of vibrato. No note is left unsuspended, and if you're looking for any attempt at sounding soulful, sighful, or inspired, then you won't find it; unless your definition of any of the above words happens to be a WHITE woman belting out minute long vocal solos as if she were Aretha Franklin or Gladys Knight.  <br /> <br />And trust me, while I am not a real fan of singers such as Knight or Franklin, there is a degree of professionalism and more than anything, vocal ability that sets them apart from any other in their class. Singers such as Aretha find their power in being able to control their voice, you never feel as if they are using every last breath, or as if they're trying to show you how wide their vocal range is. Perhaps another good example of this would be Frank Sinatra, he is not the most impressive singer in technical terms, but the way he knows his voice, the way he can work around his limited range and still sing any song perfectly, and the sheer power that comes from the control he has over his voice made him who he is. The fact is, opera singers [professional ones, at least] can control their voice to a 1/32 difference in notes, allowing for the inflections and rich tapestry that is opera. They aren't belting, they're not pushing their voice to their limit, they're simply reading a sheet of music and reproducing it accordingly.  <br /> <br />Likewise, I will say Christina Aguilera's voice will not send shivers down your spine unless you simply don't know anything about music. This album is quite the extreme opposite of Norah Jones, while Norah seems to sing every single song as if she is half asleep and dead bored, Christina seems to turn even a sweet love ballad into a loud, angry, \\"Look, I can sing three octaves above middle C\\" scream fest, to the point that Aguilera should give up pop and become the lead vocalist of a heavy metal/screamo band.  <br /> <br />If you are truly interested in young performers, I suggest you listen to Mandy Moore's self titled third album. As far as modern 20th/21st century vocalists, she is a much better example of what a voice should be like. Mandy Moore has incredible control over her voice, and her range, while not able to go as high as say, Mariah Carey's [not that I think she is a good vocalist either] is a lot more varied and definitely capable of more inflections and feeling coming out through pop songs and light ballads.  <br /> <br />More than anything, don't let the hype get to you. Visit your local community college, even an average vocalist can belt for 2 minutes like Christina can. \\"Stripped\\" wasn't \\"genius\\" or \\"sheer perfection\\" like some people here would want you to believe. The same applies to \\"BACK TO BASICS\\", there will always be a music snob telling you how great Christina Aguilera is, and trust me, they're not right. <br /> <br />And for the people who actually want jazz or blues, I HIGHLY suggest you listen to the backcatalogs of Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald, in fact, I'd even suggest you listen to Mahalia Jackson, and even Yolanda Adams. If you truly want gospel, R&B, and blues, don't turn to an ex \\"Mickey Mouse Club\\" member, turn to someone who actually understands what it means to sing the blues, to someone who can actually sing \\"His Eye Is On The Sparrow\\" and make grown men cry, not to someone whose previous opus was a rather uninspired raunch fest whose main gimmick was \\"SHE'S NAKED ON THE COVER!!!!!\\"

The CD is a fine collection of smooth jazz music. Play this CD, sit back & relax! Enjoy!

Not to mention the craziest end of the season ever.  The show is even better on DVD where it can run uninterrupted.  Seriously - the end of the season will blow your mind.
B000G75AE8|3.0|The music is great.  It's fast, it's aggressive, it's noisy and it kicks my teeth in. <br /> <br />But the lyrics are DREADFUL.  Sorry, but by-the-numbers, first-grade pro-Satan lyrics are played out.  If this was the first Slayer CD, I'd give them a pass. <br /> <br />But you expect more from a veteran band. <br /> <br />Oh pus!
B000002HH9|4.0|An album that is generally dispised by fans of the Cure, \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" is as different from everything else in the band's catalog as can be, and a the time of release it was a bit jarring.  It's an album of acoustic guitars and bright production and of open space, and while it was significantly different from anything the band has done, a decade after its release, it's pretty clear that the album, taken out of the shock of its appearance, is a decent record in its own right. <br /> <br />Of course, from the opener, you wouldn't know it'd be full of bright songs-- \\"Want\\" is classic dark Cure stuff-- ringing bass, clean tone melodic electric guitars, and noisy leads supporting a vocal that turns as fierce and jarring as anything Smith has done.  But there is a sense of space that's obvious in it that permeates the album, and the record's brightness is obvious throughout, whether in the form of explosive pop songs (\\"Mint Car\\", a positively ecstatic explosition of new love), bizarre blues/funk tinged horn driven pieces ('Gone!\\"), moody, acoustic Bowie-styled reflections (\\"jupiter Crash\\") or just downright bizarre (more of the record than you'd guess-- Latin-tinged \\"The 13th\\" defies explanatio and the lower register vocal of \\"Club America\\" is in direct opposition to the usual Cure).  Admittedly, amidst all of this there's a couple bunts (propolsive rocker \\"Trap\\", somewhat dull pop song \\"Strange Attraction\\") and yeah, the bright production can get irritating in its lack of subtlety (\\"Round & Round & Round\\"), but there's a lot to be heard here, just put aside your preconceived notions of what the band should be at the door. <br /> <br />\\"Wild Mood Swings\\" found the Cure crippled-- longtime guitarist Porl Thompson and drummer Boris Williams, who had both been with the band for a decade, left, and leader Robert Smith seemed to have felt painted in a corner stylistically.  This one is definitely quite a detour, and if you're not one to like your band's drifting from their core sound, this isn't one for you.  For the rest of us, \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" is one of the more intriguing things the band has done.

B000002HAJ|4.0|The album that thundered the Cure into the collective consciousness courtesy of pop charting single \\"Friday I'm in Love\\", \\"Wish\\" puts aside the brooding soundscapes of \\"Disintegration\\" to make a more logical successor to the diversity of \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\".   <br /> <br />While \\"Wish\\" isn't as consistently satisfying as 'Kiss Me', it still proves to be a fine and startling diverse album, touching on frantic hard rock (the utterly superb \\"Cut\\", opener \\"Open\\"), early '70s Bowie (\\"A Letter to Elise\\"), atmospheric energy pieces (the frantic \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\", capped off with a fantastic guitar solo), patient meditations (\\"To Wish Impossible Things\\") and of course, the magnificent pop pieces, personified by jangly \\"Friday I'm in Love\\".  In fact, there's precious little here NOT to like, the only real exception being the somewhat dull \\"Apart\\", but even that is quite listenable. <br /> <br />I'm of the opinion that the Cure have done better, but \\"Wish\\" is in its own right a powerful album, and is somewhat more accessible than a lot of the band's other catalog (having a well endeared pop song does that for you).  Recommended.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|I bought this DVD for the song SOS.. and it is great.  I was hoping for more fast beat songs like that, but instead there are a lot of songs with a reggae beat.  I do like Reggae too.. so that's not a bad thing.. it's just not what I was expecting.  There are a couple of slow songs on there too.  Overall.. a decent purchase.
B000002H70|3.0|Perhaps the moodiest and most claustrophobic album in history (although the latter may be fixed by the eventual remastering-- it's tough to say whether it's poor fidelity or design that made it this way), \\"Disintegration\\" is also the album on which the Cure's reputation for depressing music is built and an album upon which endless hyperbole is lauded-- this was the soundtrack for high school outcasts in the early '90s and is looked on fondly in retrospect for its place in their lives. <br /> <br />For me, regardless of how my tastes in music have spread in the decade plus since I've finished high school, invariably I'm a child of alternative music, and I'll reach for Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" or Alice in Chains' \\"Dirt\\" for that bizarre comfort in not feeling alone in being alone-- my discovery of the Cure came in college and \\"Disintegration\\" lacks that odd association for me.  Given that, it's still a fine record, but it's so bleak, and quite frankly, so long (clocking in at 72 minutes) that without a history for me and the album, it doesn't quite work as well for me as it does for others. <br /> <br />It's safe to say that about an hour of those 72 minutes is built of mid-tempo, synth string-laden, crackling-yet-rumbling bass-driven, riff-based moody ruminations, sometimes utterly fantastic in its bleakness (somewhat placid \\"Plainsong\\", bizarrely lilting \\"Disintegration\\"), sometimes after 30 seconds, you sort of wish the piece would end (9 minutes plus of \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\" will get you every time), and certainly there's at least one masterpiece in this (probably the extended \\"Pictures of You\\", with it's irresistible hook and singer/guitarist/leader Robert Smith's downright desperate vocal, but moody, piano-driven \\"Homesick\\" could give just about anything a run for it's money).  But with only one deviation from this formula (the altogether brief and still-moody-but-uptempo \\"Love Song\\"), it's hard to sustain interest in the record. <br /> <br />Admittedly, I am abit critical of this one and there's a lot to enjoy here, that shouldn't be understated, but I think if I discovered this a few years earlier, I'd be on board the \\"Disintegration is the best album ever\\" camp.  If you're a bit out of place and you're of the right age, this one is probably the soundtrack you've been looking for.
B00004ZELJ|5.0|Very well done, this collection of songs again has the boys moments to shine.

0783232039|4.0|I never really cared for this series until Jen came to it's rescue.  It's almost logical that the series goes to comedy.  I think the killer doll theme was done to death (no pun intended) So to keep this storyline alive the producers decided to go the dark comedy route.  Makes sense.  Jennifer really adds her own brand of dark comedy and that makes it work.  Enjoy!
B00005JP87|5.0|The Illusionist is the story of a young magician in 1900 Vienna.  Eisenheim (Edward Norton) bursts onto the scene and immediately captivates the entire city, gaining a sizable following, which includes the city's Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) and even the Crown Prince himself (played by Rufus Sewell).  However, Uhl eventually finds that he must arrest the magician for crimes against the empire.  Most of the movie is told by Uhl to Prince Leopold concerning his investigation into Eisenheim's life.<br /><br />Uhl's tale of Eisenheim's introduction to magic is an unbelievable tale of a creepy old wizard who imparts his powers onto the young boy, who is the son of a cabinet maker.  Eisenheim's father builds the furniture for the family of a dutchess.  As with many stories, the high class Dutchess Sophie (played as an adult by Jessica Biel) and the peasant Eisenheim fall for each other.  Eisenheim astounds Sophie with his magical skills, but of course, things end in tragedy.  Eisenheim disappears for years, only to return to Vienna as an adult.  Unbeknownst to him, Sophie is set to wed Prince Leopold.  The pair attend one of Eisenheim's shows after reading rave reviews about his act.  Eisenheim wows the audience by spouting philosophy that ties into his illusions.  While contemplating time, he makes a small orange tree grow within the space of 30 seconds and has butterflies carry a handkerchief across the stage.  When he asks for a volunteer who \\"does not fear death\\", Leopold volunteers Sophie.  While Eisenheim immediately recognizes Sophie, she does not remember him at first.  However, the pair rekindle their love affair under the nose of the Prince.<br /><br />Meanwhile, both Uhl and Leopold try to figure out the secrets to the illusions.  While Uhl sees it more as a good challenge, Leopold feels insulted that a man of lesser standing can outwit him.  After Eisenheim humiliates Leopold at a private party, the Prince orders Uhl to shut down the magician.<br /><br />What follows are two series of events by both Eisenheim and Uhl to outwit the other.  Eisenheim wants to escape Vienna with Sophie while Uhl needs to find out how his tricks work in order to arrest him for fraud.  Their paths seem to be parallel, but there may actually be a convergence point for the two rivals.<br /><br />The good story is augmented by strong performances from all the actors, especially Norton and Giamatti.  Norton's soft-spoken approach to the brilliant and patient illusionist perfectly compliments the angry and erratic Leopold, who serves as his rival in the love triangle with Sophie in the middle.  Giamatti's take on the police inspector who is divided between his loyalty to the Prince and his quest to pursue justice is very well done.  Biel is good, but is definitely overshadowed by the two male leads.<br /><br />This is film is seeing a limited release, but it is definitely worth seeing.

0790729652|5.0|(4.5/5 stars)  Exceptional envisioning of the Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in \\"Batman Begins;\\" both are equally effective, though one style over the other will likely appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's \\"Spider-Man\\") and molded black rubber suits, though this film also owes much to 1978's \\"Superman\\" with its realistic approach and A-list villains. Great stuff.
1582403589|5.0|Robert Kirkman is quickly moving up my list of favorite comics authors.  While Brian K. Vaughan and Joss Whedon still occupy the top spots, Kirkman is definitely getting close to them with his amazing books, including Invincible and The Walking Dead.  Unlike Vaughan, who is known for his high-concept books, Kirkman excels at taking the mundane and making it fascinating.  Case in point: The Walking Dead is a zombie story that focuses on character development. <br />After getting shot, Kentucky police officer Rick Grimes fell into a coma.  Upon waking up, he found himself in a world filled with zombies.  Unsure of what happened, he tries to find his wife and son, only to realize that it isn't just the hospital with an undead problem.  Thinking that they might have gone to Atlanta, he takes a squad car and some rifles and begins to make his way south.  When he gets there, he is horrified to find that the city is infested even worse.  He is saved by Glenn, a young kid who had come for supplies.  Glenn tells him about a camp of humans outside of Atlanta who are trying hard to survive the situation.  Rick is relieved to not only find his wife Lori and son Carl, but also his partner Shane.  Also present are Dale, who has contributed a camper, Donna, a conservative housewife, and Jim, a man who was forced to watch while zombies devoured his entire family.  Once Rick arrives at the camp, he begins to see how people have been living since the attack.  Food is scarce, and his guns are a welcome addition as they allow him and Shane to hunt for food.  The only available shower is in Dale's camper, and they must use pond water.  With the exception of Dale and two teenage girls, everyone sleeps in tents. <br />Often, zombie stories show how disaster can bring people together.  Kirkman uses a zombie apocalypse to show how human nature can and will always exist, and that even during a crisis, humans are equally capable of noble and dishonorable deeds.  Despite the fact that the elderly Dale has aided the group in numerous ways, Donna still looks down on him and insults him for seemingly sleeping with two young girls who aren't his wife.  Shane and Rick often argue about whether or not to move the camp, and the issue of who should have a gun threatens to drive a wedge between Rick and Lori.  While the people do work together to get a lot of things done in the face of adversity, it is a sad testament to humanity that they can still find things to argue about. <br />The biggest problem I have with this collection has nothing to do with the story itself.  Unlike most trade paperbacks, the covers aren't included.  Many of the covers are brilliant and effectively convey the emotions of the series.  Had I known that the covers weren't present (and that I would like the series so much), I would have just bought the oversized hardcover.  Still, the story is most important, and Kirkman never disappoints us.
0790730960|5.0|(4.5/5 stars)  In some ways this movie is more entertaining than the first \\"Batman\\" from 1989, though the extent of your admiration might depend on how well Tim Burton's style suits you. For me, this one is the best of the 80's-90's Batman movies. This time, the Caped Crusader is up against evil magnate Max Shreck (the always peculiar Christopher Walken), the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Michael Keaton reprises the role of Bruce Wayne / Batman, looking a little less fit than the first time around. Even though I am not a fan of Michelle Pfeiffer, I must admit she turns in a very good performance as Selina Kyle / Catwoman. It helps that time is spent developing her character, though she is believable as the meek, passive secretary turned confident, vengeful vigilante. The Christmas setting adds a nice touch to the film's atmosphere, with the snow providing a false veneer of tranquility and peace. There are many memorable scenes in the film, though my favorite is the scene with Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle dancing, not aware at first of each other's identity. That scene is very well done and confirmed for me that Pfeiffer was the correct choice for that role. Gone from the first movie are the poorly chosen Prince songs and the annoyingly comical Robert Wuhl, though remaining are the impressive visuals, exciting action, cool gadgets and decent score. The only questionable element for me was the climax at the ending, which features penguins with missiles strapped to their backs. The scene takes too long to develop and doesn't pay off, even though I appreciate the truly bizarre nature of the concept. The final scene with Bruce Wayne in his car is a close second place for best scene in the movie. Great stuff.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I just trashed a bunch of other bands, so I figured I ought to say something nice. This is a great album. It has an intensity that seems impossible, given the amount of chaos going on in within it. The singing is a bit weak, but the band's enthusiasm makes up for it.<br /><br />They are FANTASTIC live. Their ACL show in 2005 was the highlight of the festival.
0790731002|4.0|(3.5/5 stars)  Val Kilmer gives it a go as the Dark Knight, this time with Joel Schumacher at the helm. Both of those decisions turn out to be poor, with Kilmer seriously miscast and Schumacher bringing corny humor and neon lights to the party. \\"It's the car, right? Chicks dig the car.\\" Come on, neither Bruce Wayne nor Batman would utter these inane lines! And what is the deal with Schumacher's obsession with Batman's body parts (nipples, butt, etc.)?! No! No! No! There are some good aspects of the movie, however, especially the roots of Robin's origin and Jim Carrey's energetic performance as the Riddler. Neon aside, the film features some decent visuals and action. Nicole Kidman and Drew Barrymore are always pleasant to watch, though this is worth watching for Jom Carrey's performance alone.

B000EOTAM6|2.0|Charlize Theron stars in the live action adaption of the Aeon Flux animated series, which originally was on MTV. Here on Australia, the animated series was on really late on a station called SBS, so I've only caught a couple of episodes. It looked interesting, and I thought the adaption might be worth a look. Wasn't as good as I'd expected though. <br /> <br />Set a few centuries forward into the future, most of mankind has been wiped out by viruses, and wild jungle has reclaimed the planet. The remainder of humanity resides in a city, heavily controlled and plagued, not by viruses, but by mysterious disappearances and memories that haunt the minds of its citizens in dreams. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is part of a resistance group, determined to have more freedom than they have. Aeon's own resistance becomes all the stronger when her sister is killed by the government. She sets out into the heart of the city, and stumbles on much more than she bargained for, including a lover she never knew she had. <br /> <br />I must say I liked the look of the film, and the sets and such were probably what I liked best about the whole thing, a good combination of slick civilization and the lush green of the surrounding jungles and gardens. But looks aren't everything. Even though the film was a modest hour and a half, due to the straight faced dialogue and heavy seriousness over everything, it felt like much, much longer. Seemed to drag, despite the action there didn't seem to be a lot that actually happened. I can understand why the dialogue was the way it was, it adds to the unnatural atmosphere of the city, and it's similar to the way the dialogue is done in the animation, but a bit of humour and warm emotion would have been nice. <br /> <br />Special features include two audio commentaries and five behind the scenes featurettes which include footage from the original MTV series. It was good to see the comparison between the film and the cartoon. In making the film, you can see that they have tried to recreate the feel of the film. On the other hand, it doesn't quite capture the more bizarre elements of the animation, which is what made the original series so unique, I reckon. <br /> <br />As much as I like science-fiction, and as much as I liked the look of the film, I can't say I liked or recommend this film. Have a look at something else, the original Aeon Flux animated series, even.
192076920X|5.0|It doesn't get much better that Shantaram. After being intigued by the author's life story on the flap of the book, I decided it was worth a try. Gregory exceeded every expectation I had and amazed me with his gift for storytelling, attention to detail, and ability to make the reader think. Every chapter entertained as well as educated. His ability to recognize and describe peoples' character in a way the reader can readily identify with and decide to love or hate is extraordinary.<br /><br />Not only does he give an entertaining and insightful view of the Indian people, culture, and the situation in Mumbai during the 80's, he also weaves in his and others' philosophies about anything and everything. Whether you agree or not with him or his charaters, you are moved to at least consider and reflect on what you believe and accept.<br /><br />Give Shantaram a chance and you will be so enthralled for 900+ pages that you won't want it to end!
B0001CCXZW|4.0|I wouldn't exactly call myself a fan of the Gilmore Girls, I wouldn't have thought I was the kind of guy who'd be drawn to this kind of show. Still, my girlfriend got the first series on DVD and we'd been watching it in mini-mararathons now and then, and it's a pretty decent show. <br /> <br />The series is all about Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a mother and daughter who live in a small, sleepy American town, where everyone knows everyone, as well as everyone's business. Rory was the result of a fling Lorelai had with a boy when she was 16, a fling that has alienated her from her well-to-do parents, who live half an hour away. Rory thinks they're nice enough, but Lorelai tries to keep out of their way. This year, however, she won't be able to do that. You see, this year, young Rory is off to a very exclusive school, to make the most of her academic talents. This all costs money, and Lorelai is forced to ask her distanced parents for a loan. Her parents agree, on the condition that Lorelai and Rory come to see them once a week for dinner. Being the first series, there are many others firsts. First kisses, first loves, etc. I'm sure all these firsts will leave others out there wanting seconds!  <br /> <br />It's strange, but it doesn't feel like a TV series, I don't think. Like I've mentioned, I watched these episodes in bursts, and it all flowed like a really long movie (in a good way). Characters interacted, grew and developed, the people's feelings turned into ideas, and those ideas into actions across the episodes. It was quite interesting, very, very well planned and put together. The characters aren't perfect (I find Lorelai to be a bit of a control freak, for instance), but I think the writers know that, and these faults are explored nicely. <br /> <br />There's quite a lot of cultural references in the show. Rory being as intellegent as she is, she reads a lot of classic literature, and her friend Lane Kim seems to have an encyclopedia-like knowledge of popular music. It was nice to hear these references, and I knew what most of them were, but at the age these teens are supposed to be, I found a little unbelievable. It was a bit of a stretch that they knew so much, but ah well. <br /> <br />Worth a look for fans of drama-comedies. Good value set, I reckon.
0393327655|1.0|\\"First thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.\\" As a lawyer, I'm well familiar with the foregoing quote from the Bard.  Replace the term \\"lawyers\\" with the term \\"clergy,\\" and you have the thesis of Harris' book.<br /><br />Harris  began by presenting a well-argued indictment of religion as being the inspiration for much evil in this world, but when I got to Chapter Two and read his bald assertion that people should be killed if they subscribe to the wrong beliefs, I almost dropped the book.  Shades of George Orwell, \\"1984,\\" and the thought police!  Urging such a course of action places Harris in the same tradition as all the religious fanatics throughout history whom he justly condemns for killing people because they subscribed to the wrong belief system.<br /><br />I find myself hard pressed to heed the guidance of anyone who espouses killing people because they happen to have the wrong belief system, no matter how offensive that belief system may be.  The law requires both an actus reus (evil act) and a mens rea (evil mind) for criminal punishment.  Mens rea without actus reus may be deplorable, but it isn't punishable in any civilized legal system.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Seasoned British comedy writer Richard Curtis pens \\"Love Actually\\", a uniquely sequenced romantic comedy of sorts centred around the weeks leading up to Christmas. A lot of well known actors are in it too - Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and Keira Knightley, for instance. <br /> <br />The film is made up of many strands and stories, many people's lives, loosely linked, whose plot revolves around the theme of love. One of the strands include a love triangle between the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant), the US President and 10 Downing St's tea lady, which results in a diplomatic scuffle between the two countries (my favorite part of the film). There's also a cheesy comeback from a jaded old rock star, a cover of \\"Love is All Around Me\\" that replaces the word \\"love\\" with \\"Christmas\\", two nude centrefold models who fall in love while posing together, an 11 year old boy with a crush on an American girl in his class, and an English man on a trip to America to find a foreign love interest of his own. With all the plots, it does keep things intriguing, especially when the stories interact and cross each other. <br /> <br />The way the film is constructed is interesting, but the content isn't quite as much I don't think. I didn't feel the emotion really, and in a film that's kind of significant. The emotions are handled in a very English way, which seems a fairly genuine representation but, just like when Australian films deal with love, doesn't really pull at the heartstrings terribly much. With all the little interwoven stories, it's a little hard to get involved in any one character's life too deeply. Maybe it takes more viewings. My girlfriend has seen it a couple of times, and she tends to think it's that way with this film. <br />  <br />Special features include a selection of music videos (including the full version of the \\"Christmas is All Around Me\\" video used in the film), deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer and an audio commentary with writer Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangster. <br /> <br />Not the best British film around, not the best film about love around, but it's okay, actually.

It was easy to feel sympathy for her, and now I have more sympathy in general for those in her situation.<br /><br />Toby's high expectations and boasting about his father must have killed Bree each time she heard him talk about it. Also ironic how Toby seemed homophobic at first, describing LOTR as \\"gay\\" but then we see the lifestyle he has/wants.

B000BCE918|5.0|You get all three Jurassic Park movies in a neatly packaged box set for $19.99. What an awesome deal! You pay $10 a piece at WalMart to buy all three movies separately.    Plus, this set has plenty of dvd extras, including three separate documentaries about the making of each film.    Now, on to the movies themselves. My feeling is that the first Jurassic Park movie is the best. It had a very clear and powerful message: Don't mess with mother nature. Leave well enough alone.    The second movie was kind of like King Kong, involving the bringing of a T-Rex to California on display. This was the weakest movie of the lot.    The third one had the best special effects, and watching it was like watching a video game where the characters jump from level to level, experiencing one dangerous situation after another. It too, was another totally unnecessary movie except for strictly mercenary purposes, and perhaps to show how special effects have evolved considerably even since the first Jurassic Park movie.    But if you like watching dinosaurs tearing after people, these movies rock. You will also want to get the latest King Kong movie, which in my opinion outstrips the Jurassic Park series in technological glory.  Rev. Marc Axelrod

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This truly is the definitive set for alien fans.  It has two discs for each movie; containing the theatrical and special editions for each film, along with a ridiculous amount of special features for each film.  Along with all that is a ninth disc with miscellaneous material.  For those of you who buy things without seeing them first, let me outline the basic plots of the movies.  To see my full reviews on \\"Alien\\", and \\"Aliens\\", visit my profile.  In \\"Alien\\" the seven members that comprise the crew of the Nostromo, a commercial mining ship heading back to earth from a mining mission, are woken from their hybernation by \\"mother,\\" the ship's computer, in order to investigate a distress call coming from a nearby planet.  The crew are obliged to do this due to the \\"Company's\\" laws.  They descend to the planet, and three members of the crew go out to investigate.  While the crew members are out, Ripley, the crew's pilot, decides to decode the distress call, and soon dicovers halfway through translating that it isn't a distress call, but a warning.  Soon after, the team comes back, and attached to one of their faces is, is...what is it?  The rest is history.  \\"Aliens\\" continues the saga loyally.  After the ending of the previous movie, Ripley is sent back to the planet to help investigate the loss of contact with a colony on \\"LV-426\\", as the planet is now called.  this movie is almost as good as the original, and most people certainly thought so, because Sigourney Weaver got an academy award nomination for best actress.  \\"Alien 3\\" is an oft misunderstood movie, many people critizing it for the death of the remaining characters in \\"Aliens\\" except Ripley.  This time an egg was layed on the military ship headed for earth and it causes the ship to crash on an old prison world.  Soon an Alien is hatched and Ripley is once again fighting the nasty foe, but with a different twist...  \\"Alien Resurrection\\" isn't that good compared to the rest of the series, but it has a couple ofinteresting scenes, so it's worth a watch or two.  Overall the saga is wonderful, with it's amazing first installment, to its ok finale.  Definitely worth owning in my opinion.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Having never read the graphic novel, and by seeing this movie on a sheer whim I have to say that V is one of the best contemporary action films to come out in the last decade. I've never seen a movie that combines such fresh action sequences with such intellectual dialogue and comtemporary social and political issues. V is like no other movie I've ever seen. The cinematography is just incredible. There is really never a dull moment. BTW for fans of the movie be sure to check out the site THEFUTUREISOURS.com they're giving out the V costume (which is rumored to be worth several thousand dollars)

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|If you're reading up on V for Vendetta, you likely already know that it is based on the comic book series/graphic novel of the same name, written and illustrated by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, respectively. Alan Moore has detached himself from the film completely, likely because it does not follow his work completely. This is understandable. Being a writer myself, I imagine if I saw my work brought to the big screen with so many changes, I would have a fit, too. But looking in from an unbiased perspective, having not written the novel and only being a fan, I disagree with this notion entirely. The movie, while it makes several sacrifices in terms of extraneous characters and such, also streamlines the story yet still makes it an incredibly unebelievable movie. <br /> <br />The plot takes place in near-future London, England, where a totalitatian regime called Norsefire, led by High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has taken hold. 'Fingerman', or secret police, roam the streets, arresting at will. Audio surveillence and wire taps are the norm. Difference is bad; homosexuals, Muslims, and the like are persecuted. The setting is very convincing. If you were to walk into London today, I can't say it would look much different from how the movie depicts. This strengthens the films impact.  <br /> <br />Enter V, a freedom fighter (or terrorist?) who plans to bring down the oppressive regime. Spectacularly voices and acted by Hugo Weaving, V is an extremely intelligent man who, strangely, remains hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask. It just so happens that he runs into Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a timid young woman being assaulted by several Fingermen. To say any more about this first encounter, or these characters' backgrounds and histories, would be to spoil a well-thought out plot that will have you recoiling in disgust, cheering, and questioning actions of the many characters, particularly V. <br /> <br />Due to the film's material content, it is unfortunately subject to much criticism. Many individuals proclaim it as a bash against the Bush administration, others say it glorifies terrorism and that the film is \\"evil\\". This is cheapening what V for Vendetta really is. If you really think V is a terrorist, that is excellent. Why? Because that is the point of the movie. It is to get people to talk. Is V a terrorist, or is he a freedom fighter? Saying the movie glorifies him is incorrect as well. The movie tells you to voice an opinion, not what opinion to voice. And that is a beautiful thing. <br /> <br />I don't want to appear biased; I am not a supporter of the current administration, but I am also not outspoke at all against it. Perhaps you could say I stand in the middle ground. If you are interested in this film, SEE IT FOR YOURSELF. Do not let hot headed right-winged conservatives convince you that this movie is propaganda. If parallels are seen between this film and the current U.S. government, then perhaps there is indeed something wrong with our great nation's regime.  <br /> <br />Everybody should see this film. It is deep. It is moving. It is thoughtful, delivers many themes and messages, and is chock full of symbolism and dialogue that will have you deciphering during your many viewings. The film is about people. Sure, it is political commentary. But it isn't saying, \\"Oh, Bush is evil,\\" or \\"Bush=American terrorist!\\". Again, that is cheapening the many elements of V for Vendetta. If anything, this film is anti-Nazi. It speaks against the complacency of people under oppressive regimes, it urges the people of all nations of the world to be mindful of their government, and to not let themselves be lulled into a state of fear, such a state in which they would be happy to give up their freedoms for \\"security\\". That is what this film speaks out about, and against.  <br /> <br />The DVD itself includes very few special features. A few documentaries, one or two are interesting, the rest not too noteworthy. There is on that explains who Guy Fawkes was and what he intended to do, so I do suggest watching that at least. <br /> <br />But the content of the DVD is the film itself. Words do not describe this film; it has to be seen, and understood. Honestly, you either love it or you don't. I will not sugarcoat it: many who don't like it, just plain don't understand it. But whatever the case, everybody should watch this and decide for themselves.

After the introductions have been made and we see the three main characters the \\"drilling begins.\\"  Body parts are cut off, eyes gouged out and there is no shortage of maniacs on the streets.  The alluring women provide for the seduction aspect and I'm sure most men would envy the backpackers who have fun fun fun with these babes.  There is a side bar of sorts as one of the protagonists, \\"Josh\\" may be questioning his sexuality but the sex featured is pretty much for the all American red blooded straight male.  I personally was hoping for a little gay diversion but you can't have it all.<br /><br />The torture scenes are grotesque to say the least and one can't help but flinch away at times.  Although the two Americans aren't that likeable in the beginning they sure don't deserve their fate.  The guy from Iceland was funny although I felt a bit shortchanged when we didn't get to witness his torture session before the facts.  The film does pull you in if gruesome horror is your thing and it does make you feel for the victims; a feat few horror films manage to accomplish.  Eli Roth is one lucky dude to have such success with only two films and it remains to be seen what he comes up with next.<br /><br />The extras are another story.  Glimpsing behind the scenes ones sees a bunch of weirdoes engaged in more or less juvenile behavior.  They all seem to be laughing at something like they just pulled off the biggest prank in history and got away with it.  The childish antics take away from any serious expose about the film and I personally ended up disliking everyone involved with this project.  The language used in the footage was just crass and none of the actors or crew seemed to have any redeeming qualities about them.  I was more then glad when the feature was over and even skipped some of the parts.  I haven't delved into the audio commentaries yet due to the fact the featurette was so annoying so I can't comment on that.  Overall it was entertaining and accomplished what it set out to do but in my opinion Eli Roth's success has gone to his head.<br /><br />B+ for the film E for the feature\\" \\"Dissecting Hostel.\\"featurette was so annoying so I can't comment on that.

B000654Z2I|5.0|First off, I love this band and this album is a top of the stack essential... the positive reviews here are a simple hint. With that being said, the last three songs here are not my personal favorites in the Can universe. They explore dissonant realms that I feel conjure paranoid elements, anxiety and unease. However I admire the band for accomplishing this. I do not rule these later tracks in a negative light just because I find them unfriendly. This is art that can cause un-ease as well as astonishment... not an easy feat! <br /> <br />Tago Mago is a collective showcase of razor sharp musical chops and fearless, brazen creativity. It feels like the stream of conscious work of musical virtuossos unafraid to fail. The music is encouraging, spontaneous and inspirational. \\"Halleluhwah\\" is almost 15 minutes long and never loses it's captivating lock on the listener. It boasts an infectiously simple \\"building block\\" bass line that would kill a dime-a-dozen reggae song in the wrong hands... instead it soars. I can't tell you how many times I've repeated this track. The whole album is extremely artistic, including the mesmerizing cover art.  Rhythm here is heard like no other. The drumming is brilliant. The vocals are cosmic and funky and alive, among the many adjectives that spring to mind. <br /> <br />...just a great album. Yes, you've stumbled upon something amazing. Buy it already!
B0007XT87G|5.0|This band has actually been around since '94 as a side project of Steve Wilson, but back then, the band went through more line-up changes than the 2005 New York Knicks' starting five. So, we'll fast-forward to 2002's release, \\"In Absentia\\". With it, Porcupine Tree had begun to gradually become more popular, flaunting their signature sound. Wilson and company then hit the studio once again and filled in all the holes ( though there were very few ) with 2005's release, \\"Deadwing,\\" which is, in my opinion, a tad better than \\"In Absentia\\". As most of you already know, Steve Wilson is the current producer for my Opeth, my favorite band. It is obvious that Wilson has taken the influence he had from working with these legends and worked it into his own sound. Don't believe me? Listen to \\"Arriving Somewhere ... But Not Here\\". Hear that blues-y solo? That's Mikael Akerfeldt, Opeth's frontman. To tell you the truth, the only reason I know about these guys is because of Opeth. Nevertheless, Wilson will never lay forth a death metal growl, only dreamy, cleanly-sung vocals here. That's good though, because it means that these guys are totally different. My favorites are below ( I hate this, because I'd like to put the whole freaking CD here ) : <br /> <br />1. Deadwing - The title track has an odd vibe to it, but it's very catchy. The spoken back-up vocals are a neat idea. Once again a taste of Opeth : tempo changes, many different sections, great riffs. <br />2. Shallow - So, so catchy, the catchiest on the CD. It just might be my favorite track on the album, too. I could not tell you one bad thing about this song, right here. \\"This city drains me, or maybe it's the smell of gasoline.\\" <br />4. Halo - Are these guys Christian? By the lyrics, it sure seems like it. More eerie feelings are given on this track. The chorus is pretty much irresistable, here. <br />5. Arriving Somewhere ... But Not Here - As aforementioned, we are delighted with a guest appearance of Mikael Akerfeldton this track. Yet again, there are many sections of the song, and they all flow together subperbly.  <br /> <br />There is one thing I'd like to know though, where is the bonus track, \\"She's Moved On,\\" on Amazon? It's a great song, and I feel people will be missing out by not hearing it. <br /> <br />For some reason, I feel that many bands will be sprouting up in the next year, in search of having a sound similar to Porcupine Tree's. Progressive metal is becoming quite popular these days, but we will always be thankful to bands like Porcupine Tree that help to shape it and make it as it is. Oh yea, I almost forgot, check it out if prog metal is your scene, man. Thank you for your time. <br />
B00013F38K|5.0|I watched \\"Kung Fu\\" when it debuted and I was age ten. I must admit I watched the show for the fight scenes. Now at age 44 I'm watching it again. It's a good show, less is more, I'm glad I bought the DVD.
B000301YY8|4.0|I really like some songs on here. So Long Jimmy, Tears and Rain, Goodbye My Lover, and You're Beautiful are all very nice listens and I love the song High. I think they're well written and incoportate guitar nicely but this CD defintely has some problems.    The main thing about the CD is that about the songs on here sound very similar. Cry and No Bravery are emotional but they are pretty dificult to enjoy if you're not in a down mood. In fact, all these songs are pretty depressing. Billy and So Long Jimmy have similar sounds also. The chrous to High and Out of My Mind seem to haave similar guitar sounds.A second problem is James himself.Granted, I like his voice. I think it's different and pretty but after you listen to about 4 songs, it sounds like he's whining or a girl (or both.)     Overall this CD was worth the purchase but I don't listen to it a ton. More of an occasional thing when I'm feeling sorta down.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|funk rock or funk metal ? I don't care. What I only care is the good music they've been doing these last years. Even if I could never listened very good the \\"Californication\\" album, I'd say that this is one of their (lately) great albums. When I knew that this album was a doble cd, I right away thought about the Guns' \\"Use Your Illusion\\" doble cds. But (everyone) had the luck the result was even better that of the guns' cds. This \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" could be marked as \\"money maker\\", and maybe it is, but it is also a very good funk album. To me , it reminds me a little bit some sound of \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and something also from \\"Californication\\", making it a very good example of good music. About this album , I would also say that , to explain these songs, thay are way different from one to another , and this is the greatness of this album. One song recalled \\"Blood Sugar...\\", the other \\"Californication\\", and there is another one that recalls the '70s, when the funk began. I really thank this band, because every song is different, and making 28 different songs in one/or 2 cds, is quite hard. To me, they are not kunf metal, they play what they are, they play what they like, and with luck, they play what we like. I really enjoyed all the songs, maybe someone has been made for the radio stations, but they've been made very good, too, at the same time. I was really impressed by the change (and what a change!) of this band, because they could have followed the \\"blood sugar...\\" success, but they did not. An example is the title track, when it starts, it looks \\"californication\\", but it is even better. Then, \\"Humb...\\" looks another kind of song, but later it is a RHCP song, even is a bit different from the rest of (this very same song changes its rythm 3 times, cool!!!!). and \\"she's only 18\\" looks like one lost track from \\"Blood Sugar....\\", and the chorus is amazing!!! Thanks, guys, keep on!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This CD by Boston is by far the best they have done in their career. Songs like More Than A Feeling, Peace Of Mind, Foreplay/Long Time, Rock & Roll Band and Smokin' are still played very heavy on the radio. 2 of my favorite songs on this CD are, More Than A Feeling and Something About You. Both are masterpieces of work. Guitar playing at its best is done on this CD. I love the way More Than A Feeling starts out like a crescendo and works its way into some of the best guitar playing ever done by any band and it also has good harmony vocals. The whole CD has good harmony vocals. Foreplay/Long Time starts out like a synthesizer/organ music and works its way into guitar riffs and playing. Rock & Roll Band is like an autobiography of the band put into music. The first line tells you that. \\"We were just another band out of Boston on the road tryin' to make ends meet.\\" All in all this is an excellent CD and would be an asset in anybody's collection.

0679731725|5.0|Sometimes books are too long. Occasionally, they are too short. And, all too rarely, they are perfect in length. This is one book whose length is perfect.<br /><br />Listening to a well mannered man servant, or butler, about his professional ideals of the service to the lord can be too much for the American reading public.  But, Ishoguro does it masterfully with this insightful piece about a butler who worked for a lord basically overlapping and  between the two great wars.<br /><br />Pride in his work is what he describes as the professional demeanor of the butler. There are references to an equivalent to a Butler's Hall of Fame, and how our butler's father may have been one to be included - as well as himself.  But, ironically, as we learn more about the revered lord to whom our butler serves, the more we learn that the butler's character exceeds the lord - who we discover is a lame \\"good old boy\\" from another generation whose best intentions become his worst nightmares.<br /><br />The love for a woman is distant - they actually feel deeply for one another but never even embraced or discussed their respective emotions. The concept of human emotion is stilted in a manner which makes it difficult for American readers to understand, but the author does a great job of leading our Yank noses through such an education.<br /><br />Most of the thoughts or memories occur while riding 4 days to see the butler's \\"almost\\" old flame. And, it was a great ride. Thank God, this author had the knowledge and savvy to assure us not to plod through another 4 days.  I say this because during the 4 day journey, we learned, we lived, and we saw enough of the unfortunate soul from whom this book is written in the first person. We understood, and understood well, just how proud and sad the butler was, is and will be.

B00005JP87|4.0|Not having much information other than what was contained in the previews, I wasn't sure if \\"The Illusionist\\" was going to be the tale of a magician with supernatural powers, a story of political intrigue, a `bodice ripper,' or some combination of the three.  Although the film has story elements from each of these, it is primarily a love story and a rather coolly cerebral exploration on the nature of 'what is real.'<br /><br />The film begins with the young Eisenheim, who is son of a furniture maker, meeting a magician along a deserted country road and becoming fascinated by the illusions he creates.  Soon Eisenheim is practicing his hand at the conjurer's craft in his every spare moment.  When he meets Sophie, who is a member of the Royal Court, they find in each other their mirror twin.  Both are trapped by their narrowly defined roles in life--with little hope of escaping.  The young Eisenheim (Aaron Johnson) and the young Sophie (Eleanor Tomlinson) are both excellent in their abbreviated roles at the beginning of the film.  They convey all the innocent passion of star-crossed childhood sweethearts who are separated by status and social standing.  When they are finally found out and pulled apart, Eisenheim packs his meager possessions and leaves to travel the world in the pursuit of other forms of magic.  (The adult portrayals of Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and Sophie (Jessica Biel) seemed to lack the passionate emotional spark of the two teenage actors playing their younger counterparts.)<br /><br />Years later, when Eisenheim returns to Vienna, he has become a master illusionist, far transcending the usual fare seen in music hall venues.  When Sophie comes on stage to assist him in one of the illusions, the lovers are secretly reunited and try once again to escape.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell plays Crown Prince Leopold with brutish and sinister menace.  Leopold is planning to usurp the crown from his uncle and marry Sophie (who is a member of the Royal Hungarian family) to facilitate this end.  Paul Giamatti plays the compromised, ambitious and somewhat morally ambiguous Police Chief Inspector Uhl whose job it is to spy upon Sophie and report back to Leopold.<br /><br />I would recommend this film with some reservations.  The muted color palette of early 20th Century Vienna and the drabbed down sepia tones of the theaters where Eisenheim performs are skillfully rendered.  His illusions are quite beautiful and--even with advantage of CGI--looked extraordinary.  Despite the somewhat self-conscious accents and the not always period-authentic dialogue, the actors all turned in rich and layered performances.<br /><br />Eisenheim's enigmatic nature may be the biggest impediment to the audience's connection to the love story.  He is reserved, mysterious and--like all good magicians--impossible to read.  This can work at cross-purposes with the romance.  Since Eisenheim's and Sophie's love for each other is the fulcrum upon which all the other events turn--it is important to get this exactly right--the rest is just smoke and mirrors.  A good film that just misses being a great one.nd.

B000003T9B|5.0|\\"Feel the Fire\\" is Overkill's debut album, and even though it was released on an independent label, it still remains one of their heaviest albums of all time. Even though much different then Horrorscope and The Years of Decay, which are much more polished, this is a raw and in your face debut from the band. The songs are pure thrash, and extremley well done. If you are a fan of the band, even their newer material, which is still solid, this is a must for your overkill collection. Sometimes debut albums can be weak or sloppy, and production usually sucks, espically in the extreme music genere, but this one is a treat. Even though there isnt much polish on this, and more crunching guitars and blast beats, the rawness is what makes this album. Bobbys vocals are so high pitched, that his range then was amazing. Even though more screaming then actually singing, like Bobby does now, its still great, and did I mention that its so damn heavy. Pick it up, you will be happy that you did
0529064847|2.0|The New American Bible translation has some positive features, but is definitely not a Bible I would recommend for anyone seeking spiritual edification. Particularly in its footnotes, it is obvious that it is an edition made by secular-minded scholars for secular-minded scholars, and actively undermines both Roman Catholic doctrine and basic supernatural belief.<br /><br />First, the positives: I think it is a good translation. I certainly do not have any knowledge of the original languages, but I find the English rendering clear, serious, readable and free from any jarring modernisms such as inclusive language or slangish concessions to a post-literate American audience. I find the cross-references very comprehensive and most of the footnotes, particularly in the New Testament, to be very informative. The Introduction includes a good, (but necessarily cursory) treatise on the history of the Bible, and at the back of the book is an educational encyclopedia of religious terms, although some of the entries or omissions are rather curious. (Definitions for \\"Acacia Wood\\", \\"Acco\\" and \\"Achaia\\" but hardly anything for \\"Pope\\" or \\"Salvation\\" and nothing regarding Intercession of the Saints or the theology of the Virgin Mary.) Also, to me the font is easy on the eyes and I like that they've printed all of Jesus' words in red.<br /><br />The problem is in the footnotes and introductions to the various books. In many cases, they are blatantly heretical and naturalistic (ascribing natural explanations to events the Bible describes as supernatural). I've never drawn up a list of all such instances but a couple that spring to mind are the introduction the Book of Daniel which says that the book was written after its prophecies had already been fulfilled, and the footnote to MT 21:7 which says that Matthew misunderstood the Old Testament prophecies. There are many other such examples. In all, they do not constitute a huge part of the total footnotes, but aren't a mere handful enough to undermine one's confidence in the Bible and the Church? I really don't understand how this book received the imprimatur of the bishops. Also, a smaller criticism is that there aren't enough footnotes. Whole sections of the Old Testament, and a few theologically significant verses of the New Testament go unremarked upon, but the editors often see the need to insert a footnote to explain the etymology of some trifling Hebrew name. Considering the theological deficiencies of many of this Bible's footnotes, perhaps it's good they didn't include more. But it still seems like there was a lot left unsaid for what is supposed to be a_study_Bible.<br /><br />This Bible should be retired. It's an offense to Catholics and a danger to one's soul. Unfortunately I don't yet know what else to recommend, although previous reviewers have left their opinions, which I shall surely look into. Anything has to be better than this abominable relic of the Age of Aquarius.e one's confidence in the Bible and the Church?

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Rian Johnson's debut film Brick caused something of a minor sensation among critics and discerning cineastes earlier this year when it won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award, the John Cassavetes Award for the best film production with a budget under $500,000. Brick re-imagines high school life through a 1940s film noir lens as Johnson populates his film with terse, fast-talking characters and all kinds of plot twists reminiscent of a Dashiell Hammett novel.<br /><br />Johnson focuses on tiny details captured in close-up shots, like a burning cigarette or lingering shots of people's shoes or, most memorably, Emily's dead hand resting in shallow water. Many of these visual cues are nods to the cinema of David Lynch, complete with a shot of a ceiling fan that evokes the surreal filmmaker's short-lived T.V. show Twin Peaks. While characters tend to speak in the same cryptic fashion of a Lynch film, the snappy dialogue that flies fast and furious between characters is more akin to the way people speak in Howard Hawks films.<br /><br />Much like the Coen brothers film Miller's Crossing, Brick adopts stylized noir slang but in this case, contrasts it with a contemporary look that works surprisingly well. Like Gabriel Byrne's character in Miller's Crossing, Brendan is a smart guy who is often shown thinking as he tries to stay two steps ahead of everyone else. He is someone who is able to figure out all the angles and play them to his advantage but in the process gets repeatedly beaten up (much like Byrne's character).<br /><br />Even though Brick references Lynch and the Coens, it still feels like an original work made by someone with a distinct vision. The cast is uniformly excellent and handles Johnson's stylized prose perfectly. It's a dense text that has to be delivered in a specific way for the movie to work the way it does. To his credit, Johnson makes some fascinating choices in how he frames scenes and uses unusual close-ups with a minimalist score that is atmospheric but not obvious about it. It's a movie that constantly keeps us guessing, not knowing what to expect next but he displays enough confidence in his direction that we trust him to take us wherever he wants. Brick is an amazing debut film with an ingenuous premise and such a novel way of executing it that you find yourself immediately drawn into this world that Johnson has created.<br /><br />There are eight deleted and extended scenes each introduced by Johnson. There is more footage of Laura's party with the entire performance of \\"The Sun Whose Rays are all Ablaze\\" that she sings.<br /><br />\\"The Inside Track: Casting the Roles of Laura and Dode\\" features audition footage of Nora Zehetner and Noah Segan reading for their roles. They are both excellent and it is obvious why they got the roles.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by writer/director Rian Johnson, actors Noah Segan and Nora Zehetner, producer Ram Bergman, production designer Jodie Tillen and costume designer Michele Posch. Johnson talks about how he started off with no connections in the film industry and that it took six to seven years of shopping around his \\"weird, little script\\" to various production companies before he finally got the chance to make his movie. Instead of having everyone talk over each other, Johnson interviews each person about their experiences making the movie.

B000301YY8|2.0|Some men sound good singing in falsetto.  Some men don't.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  Almond Joy's got nuts  Mounds...    Ooops, I got off track there.    Let me give some background information.    On a few occasions, my attention was called to the tv set as I noticed a beautiful sounding song playing during a commercial about kids or something. I found out later the singer was James Blunt and the song was \\"Beautiful.\\" I heard it a couple more places, but I never heard the song in its entirety.    I heard good things about the album and the singer. He was even one of Vh-1's \\"You Oughta Know\\" artists. I figured he must be good. Even after reading negative reviews here, I wasn't daunted. I just figured they were sour grapes who have a problem with \\"emo\\" music in general.    Well, I tell you, I regret sincerely spending my money on this cd. In a nutshell, it's cloying, sappy, and James Blunt has one of the most unattractive voices I've ever heard. I'd rather hear William Hung sing \\"She Bangs\\" than listen to Blunt sing Goodbye My Lover. And what I find to be the most cruel part of my experience is the song I bought the entire album for is not even that good. When you listen to the song in its entirety, you realize how thin and simplistic it is. And why does he have not one, but two songs about men?    Bottom Line: A diabetes causing album that crosses the line between \\"emotive\\" and \\"sappy.\\" It sounds manufactured and Blunt isn't nearly as talented as he's been credited to being. There are some nice songs like Three Wise Men and No Bravery. But save your money and buy a Maxwell cd instead.
B000AA4M9U|3.0|B.B King may be one of the best bluesmen alive but a collaboration album like this is not his forte'. This formula was put to much better use some years ago by John Lee Hooker with two very good albums (\\"The Healer\\" & \\"Mr. Lucky\\")with a MUCH better selection of guests.   Other reviewers seem very divided about what's good & what isn't on this album but I agree that Van Morrison is by far the best (how could anyone expect less?) and Billy Gibbons & Bobby Bland are, of course, great also. Sheryl Crow is totally out of her element on a very lame version of the great song \\"Need Your Love So Bad\\" (Peter Green's version, his best by far is live on \\"Shrine 69\\"- probably spoiled me for anyone else's). The biggest surprise for me was Gloria Estefan's heartfelt performance on \\"--Better World-\\" probably the bluesiest cut on the album-didn't know she had it in her. The rest is pretty mediocre; even Eric Capton couldn't breathe new life into \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\"; it's just too shopworn. However, even at 80 B.B. King can save just about anything; he's still one of the greatest.

0895260131|4.0|Robert Spencer's The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam is a welcome respite from the sugary nonsense about Islam that has dominated the western media for decades.  Be warned:  This carefully researched critique presents some very disturbing material, that many readers might prefer not to know.  While most of the glowing descriptions of Islam now prevalent in the West were penned by political liberals, or dedicated Muslim apologists, Spencer is very much in the opposite camp.  At times his tone is strident and his revulsion against this religion all too plain.  Even so, this is a very readable book, and a nice counterpoint to the \\"religion of peace\\" propaganda that we've all heard ad nauseum.  A must for anyone who would like to know more about ALL the facets of Islam.  Some blunt and honest criticism of this faith is long overdue. Also, it's time the world became familiar with the historical developments leading up to the Crusades, instead of simply dismissing those campaigns as morally bankrupt attempts at imperialism.  If what Spencer says is true, Islam is the real imperialistic aggressor; much of what we now consider \\"Muslim\\" land was taken over by force from the original Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, Hindu, or Buddhist indigenous populations centuries ago, with horrendous destruction of life and property.  So much for the \\"religion of peace\\".

B000FIMG68|2.0|The first season was amazing.  It had twists and turns that were always great.  In this season the twists and turns don't answer anything important.  It gets dull toward the middle of the season.  I love how the inhabitants on the island don't ever question why there are polar bears on the island(what ever happened to them anyway?) oh yeah and that smoke monster that tries to kill the survivors on a couple of occasions.  Common the writers are running out of story and they can't keep up with answering all of the mysteries they reveal.  I WOULD ANSWER ABOUT 6 OR 7 MYSTERIES BEFORE I START NINE OTHERS!!
B000F6IOC0|5.0|The movie starts off from where the first movie left off. You get more of an idea that there is more to why Selene's family was killed. There are a few surprises as well but by the time the movie ends, it at least gives you something to at least yearn for a little more.  <br /> <br />The special features just tell you about what went behind the making of the film which was really helpful if you like to watch the kind of training all hte actors went through.  <br /> <br />However, don't take my word for wanting to watch this movie - if you want to see it, then buy it or rent it.
6305212112|1.0|I searched for reviews of this movie before I saw it, and didn't find any. People I talked to had not seen it, but had heard it was good. So I finally sat down and watched it. The acting was top notch. It was a tightly scripted chick flick about two friendships. One in a nursing home, and one in the friendship retold by Cleo Threadgoode during those visits.  On the down side it was very feministic, to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres. Women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women. Kathy Bates' character went from being a trampled by everyone woman to a \\"don't push me\\" type. While much of this was funny, this was one extreme to the other rather than a middle ground. In spite of this I enjoyed the first part of the movie. That is until the surprise ending. While this gives away a bit of a plot spoiler, the ending involved unwitting cannibalism. This made me sick, and I felt sick a long time after watching it. Had I known how sour the ending would be, I never would have watched this movie.
B000H7JCG4|4.0|OMG. I can't believe it's nearly here. In Australia we missed some of the later season so I can't wait to catch up on them. Hopefully it won't take too long for season 2 to come out.
B000G759LW|5.0|I like Mercy On Me and Understand. All the songs aren't like those typical pop songs - starts with couple low uncleared phases, then suddently high screaming notes. These are real songs with real Christina's voices. From track 1 till the end, it is a total pleasent journey.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This lovely album kept me company for hours of sketching and painting.  Great, intelligent lyrics, and mellow but upbeat music make this the ideal artists companion.  I'll definitely check out more of Sufjan Stevens work.
B000001GXF|4.0|DG has brought together, now on their \\"The Originals\\" collection, two recordings dating from different periods of the Amadeus quartet's recording career: in 1958, then the very early days of stereo, they rerecorded Schubert's \\"Death and the Maiden\\" which they had already committed to mono LP in 1953 (now in an invaluable \\"Original Masters\\" DG box, [[ASIN:B0000U1NGK Amadeus Quartet: Haydn, Schubert, Brahms 1951-1957]]). The \\"Trout\\" Quintet, recorded in 1975 with Emil Gilels (with bassist Rainer Zepperitz), dates from their later years and is their second go at the piece (the first was with Hebzibah Menuhin on EMI in 1958, reissued on CD by EMI, [[ASIN:B00000DO2F Trout Quintet/Trios]], and Testament, [[ASIN:B0000AH3DB Schubert: Trout Quintet; Mozart: String Quartet, K. 387]]). The Gilels and Amadeus quartet encounter was a purely studio affair which before this recording had resulted in the Brahms 1st piano quartet, [[ASIN:B000001GQ4 Brahms: Piano Quartet op.25 / Ballades op.10]].<br /><br />The great thing about the opening \\"allegro vivace\\" (taken with its repeat) in particular and the \\"Trout\\" quintet in general is that Gilels and his partners do not let their interpretation be colored by any pre-conception of a \\"gemütlich\\", e.g. easy-going and genial Schubert. On the contrary, they give full weight and impact to the accents and piquant perkiness to the staccato markings, resulting in a reading of great vigor and zest. Gilels proves a fine chamber player, with crisp playing and a fine sense of balance with his partners.<br /><br />Not so great, on the other hand, is the well-known and distinctive feature of the Amadeus quartet: namely, Norbert Brainin's thin violin tone and sometimes pitch uncertainty, Martin Lovett's dry cello emission and Peter Schidlof's nasal viola. This is especially penalizing in the 2nd movement's deeply moving viola & cello cantilena (1:30), which doesn't approach the gripping lyricism which others impart to it. The 3rd movement's Presto isbrisk (though not as brisk as Curzon-Vienna Octet members, [[ASIN:B00002MXN2 Schubert: Trout/Death & the Maiden Curzon & Vienna Octet]]) but string tone is somewhat shrill; fortunately (and unlike the afore-mentioned Curzon-Vienna Octet) the pace is maintained in the central trio, consequently avoiding the usual mawkishness. In the 4th movement's \\"Trout\\" theme, the tempo is somewhere in between Curzon's lively briskness and Serkin's more sedate deliberation with Marlboro friends in 1967 ([[ASIN:B00000275O Schubert: Piano Quintet- Trout, d. 667 / Mozart: Clarinet Quintet, K. 581]]), and the ensuing variations maintain a reasonably acceptable unity of tempo, with a lively and carefree coda; but violin tone retains a not entirely pleasant edge of shrillness. The Finale is nicely brisk, forward-moving and carefree, reminiscent of Serkin. All things considered, despite the slight discomfort of the Amadeus' tone production, this is a fine version of Schubert's piano quintet. Now, for more choices of \\"Trouts\\" recorded since 1975, see my reviews of the Beaux Arts Trio (Philips), Brendel-Cleveland (Philips), Richter-Borodine (EMI), Ax-Ma and partners (Sony), Badura-Skoda (Amiata),  Adès-Belcea (EMI) among others (links in the comments section).<br /><br />The \\"Death and the Maiden\\" is early stereo and the sound is somewhat dry, not as full as that afforded by Boston Skyline's transfer to the Fine Arts quartet from 1962 (with the same coupling - see my review, [[ASIN:B000001UOO Schubert: Trout Quintet/Death and the Maiden Quartet]]), but it is still quite acceptable and with no audible tape-hiss. Interpretively, the opening \\"Allegro\\" a little more spacious and slightly less biting than the Amadeus' earlier mono attempt, with a tendency to be a little finicky on small details - and of course in much better sound. As before, the opening D triplets are taken legato rather than the written staccato and rushed headlong into; then ensues a reading that is vigorous and dogged rather than fast and furious; it commendably avoids any mawkish prettifying of the second, lyrical theme, which is given instead a fine rhythmic snap on its further developments, though not as biting as in the earlier version. As in 1953, the famous \\"Death and the Maiden\\" theme (2nd movement) is taken at a forward-moving pace, true to Schubert's \\"andante con moto\\" indication, and tempo relationships in the ensuing variations are more coherent than before, with less \\"gas and breaks\\"; Martin Lovett's cello voices a profound and moving chant in the 2nd variation, and the 3rd variation sounds like the heavy and powerful canter of warhorses rather than like Death furiously whipping its steed. Where this 1958 remake varies most from its 1953 predecessor is in the Scherzo and Finale, where the Amadeuses now go for power and weight more than rage and fury, but the Scherzo's middle trio maintains a laudable unity of tempo and displays charm without mawkishness. Likewise the \\"Presto\\" Finale is more deliberate than five years before and elicits less of the sense of a race to the abyss - more of an unhurried - but inexorable? - canter.<br /><br />One can think of more gripping \\"Death and the Maiden\\" quartets (see my reviews of the Hollywood Quartet-Testament, Juilliard-Testament, Alban Berg Quartet-EMI, Brodsky-Teldec, Petersen-Capriccio among others)  but this one has nonetheless something of a classic poise.
B000GYI32M|5.0|Season 3 was a definte improvement from Season 2. Season 2 was alright... but didn't live up to the original. I thought that the stories invoked in this season were a lot more better, especially Juile moving into a tailer, Ryan's Harbor fueds, and their senior year. As most people know, the season ends tragically. Which isn't such a bad idea. They lose someone who wouldn't make much of a story in season 4 if (he/she) kept living. I thought it was tragic that they left, but it's time for the show to move on. Also the creators of Season 3 got a new Katlin. That's a dissapoitment, just like they got a new Trey in season 2. The actors that replaced them are good, just it's silly they are replaced in the first place. They need to hire someone for the part and stick to them. It was also a good season ending, when Ryan managed to tye most loose ends with one family member. I think season 4 will be good and will take the show onto a whole new direction.
1577314808|5.0|I have to say I'm really liking this book. Yes it repeats itself but for me, this is a good thing. The book has one and only one message \\"Don't think, just observe\\". He says this same message in hundreds of ways but given how vital this message is, I welcome the repetition.   Most other books that I have read on the subject, from the Bible to the \\"Questions to a Zen Master\\" seem to have this same vital message but it's not IN YOUR FACE as it is in this book. For example, I found this message clearly but only in the last chapter of Deepak Chopra's \\"The Way of the Wizard\\"; it affected me powerfully... for 2 days and then it started to diminish. For me, it helps to see this message again and again to remind and motivate me to continue striving for it until it becomes second nature.  If you're simply looking for a good read, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a new perspective on life, read this one with an open mind.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|i purchased the gilmore girls season 3 dvd set about a month ago and i love it.Its Hiliariously funny and romantic on all levels.this season also includes unknown then,Adam Brody from the O.C which is nerdy and funny. <br />you also get a book of phrases that the cast has said in the eposodes.and also a booklet of what eposode is about,which is really good <br />

0393061310|4.0|Why have some cultures developed nuclear power plants and space rockets and other cultures have stayed in the stone age? <br /> <br />It's a big topic and Diamond makes a credible stab at it. <br /> <br />Is the book too dense?  Yes. <br />Is the book repetitive?  Yes. <br />Would the book benefit from some editing? Yes. <br /> <br />Is the book worth reading?  Absolutely. <br /> <br />Diamond is a geographic determinist.  Successful advancement, (meaning jumbo jets versus stone axes) is controlled by the culture's environment.  For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has a diverse population of large mammals, all unsuitable for domestication, such as the lion or the hippopotamus.  Asia had access to many superstars of domestication, like the horse or the cow.  Euro-Asia gets a developmental lead by being able to access these animals at a much earlier time than other cultures. <br /> <br />Yes Diamond suffers from a problem of many academics; the one theory that controls the universe.  Picture the history professor that bases his lecture that most of World War Two was a struggle over zinc deposits, etc.  But in defense of Diamond, a lot of his theory does hold water.  Anthropologists will fight over this book for years to come and just like the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Gibbon; this book may be discredited by future generations, but this is truly a thought provoking book.   Read the book and join in the debate.  You'll learn a lot.  I certainly did.
6305428050|4.0|This movie is old, but its funny. Totally cheesy like most old movies, but still has its funny moments. Makes u think twice about babysitting....hehe.
0451527712|5.0|Reading Frankenstein and thinking it would be like the movies in Hollywood is totally wrong. When reading Frankenstein in the beginning it is somewhat slow but turns gruesome. People get killed even in their innocents. The monster is truly evil, not nice. Middle of the book becomes interesting but you feel sorrow and some sympathy for the monster. In the end the monster himself reveals the complete truth of what he is. This may sound like a book report but feelings cannot capture the feeling that erupts inside during the novel.<br /><br />If you look at the novel from a critique point of view it is a horror but still spellbinding. The story is not just simple and scary but helps you understand the nature of emotions and the beast inside our hearts. Love and wanting of acceptance is an emotion that is not understood easily but this book uncovers the secrecy on how one is wanting to be accepted in society.<br /><br />For the people who like books of horror but no meaning this book is okay. People who want a true classic but be mystified by a monster that is untaimable this is an excellent book. If you are looking for a sweet feminine or just a normal novel this might not fit you. This novel in my opinion is a true classic and you can tie it to todays world easily even though this was written over 100 years ago.
1401301363|5.0|In her fifth cookery book, \\"Feast\\", Nigella Lawson offers a collection of recipes and occasions to mark our lives. It is her experience that \\"food is the vital way we celebrate anything that matters\\" (vii). Before us, then, is a book replete with recipes new and familiar to mark occasions traditional (Christmas, New Year, Easter), foreign (at least from my ethnocentric perspective: Venetian, Eid, and Rosh Hashanah), and fun (Valentine's Day, Breakfast, and Midnight). A feast is not just a meal; it is a condition of an innate human need to mark an event or occasion with those to whom we have a close bond by augmenting it with food.   <br /> <br />The inviting tone with which Nigella writes has remained in tact, in spite of the size of the tome and despite this being her fifth book. So, as always, one feels encouraged to make anything at any time due to the bolstering of confidence that Nigella inspires. The layout of \\"Feast\\" is very clear. Each section has its own title page and all recipes are preceded with a personal experience and/or a history/genesis/evolution. The numerous photographs are well composed and induce hunger.  <br /> <br />Approximately ten previously published recipes are reproduced here, and another five are sufficiently reworked so as to be practically new recipes. This is nothing in a book that has over four hundred pages of recipes. In reference to Jewish cooking, Nigella quite clearly states that Jews are too dispersed to have developed one cooking style (176). Similarly, Jewish cultures are quite distinct even beyond the broad groupings of Ashkenazi and Sephardi. Nigella clearly recognizes this and thus offers a disclaimer so as not to offend anyone, even while demonstrating examples of both Middle Eastern and Eastern European Jewish cooking; furthermore, she is of Jewish descent herself. <br /> <br />Nigella implores the reader to pick and choose from, and/or combine the feasts for his/her own celebration of life. And there is indeed a bountiful amount from which to select, ranging from soul-warming to refreshing, light to decadent. This book is a great \\"quick reference\\" for themed ideas, if one is after something kitsch, to improve upon one's own traditions, or for inspiration. I love this book.
B0002B55WA|5.0|I give it 5 because it is the only known video of I Am The Walrus!! One of my favorite Beatles tunes. The movie itself was a flop, not going over well with the critics. I like it, and have been looking for it, and found it here!!!
B000AWYOGE|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this film. Although it was suspenseful and the screen shots were really good, I felt that the plot is very predictable.  Just like \\"The Ring\\", the malevolent force is a little girl that was abandoned by her parents. It has a lot of drama between Dahlia (Connelly) and her ex-husband concerning the custody of their daughter and I suppose that it the human-interest part of the story. I cared about the characters, especially Dahlia's little girl, Cecilia. Ariel Gade's acting was heartbreaking. If you're looking to be scared, this is not a film for you.  It's more of a psycho-drama.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Well finally George Lucas is releasing the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL Star Wars trilogy on DVD!!! These movies are not high definitions and do not have 5.1 surround sound, but that IS how they were released in the 1970's and early 1980's in theatres! Technology was a lot simpler then! Ideally it would be great if they were in surround sound and in high definition, but this is a much more AUTHENTIC version.  <br /> <br />I HATE the awful additions that George Lucas made to these movies in the 1990's. GREEDO SHOOTS FIRST! Why does Han Solo say to Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars IV A New Hope  \\"Jabba you are a wonderful HUMAN BEING?!!!!\\" (when Han and Jabba meet by his Millenium Falcon)  This 1990's addition doesn't even make sense as he is NOT human??!!! Not to mention the terrible effect of Han Solo walking around Jabba and standing on his tail, which looks very fake and is badly rendered and edited. A real hatchet job! <br /> <br />FINALLY THE ORIGINAL MOVIES AS I REMEMBER SEEING THEM AT THE THEATRES, THANK YOU!!!  GET OVER IT NERDS!  <br /> <br />The original movies were great! Han Solo was a great character. Darth Vader and The Emperor were evil. They had ground breaking special effects, fun, adventure, great characters, great actors and chemistry between them, great stories, good humour, and interesting themes (spritual- The Force,  empowering- rebels taking on an evil empire, and self belief, but to name a few), and a speedy pace, unlike the newer trilogy (1-3) which were incredibly slow, badly acted, were boring political stories, badly directed, contained unbelievably cringeworthy terrible dialogue, had boring characters - Qui-Gon Jinn etc,  awful characters- Ja Ja Binks, were oversaturated with meaningless special effects, and completely uninspiring.
0312323867|5.0|This and Something Borrowed are both addicting books!  I think I finished each in a week.  I wished the author continued the series.  I absolutely loved them and haven't read books these good in a long time!
0780626494|4.0|This movie is a \\"fun\\" flick. It makes you feel good about yourself, even when you stick out like a sore thumb.

0060751967|4.0|Great Quick Read!!!! <br /> <br />I read the Second book first Vamps in the City.  So I just had to find this one. <br />Characters like Shanna and Roman are wonderful and you just hope that things work out.  The supporting cast of characters are as colorful and enteraining as you would find in any book.  <br />The Bad guys make you want them to get what is coming to them. <br />  <br />If you are looking for something that is enjoyable to read this book is a good grab.  Having read this one and the next I think that this will be a series of books that will get lots of attention.
0312965788|5.0|This was a great book. I decided to read it because I like animals, and I'm so glad I did. I loved this book; it was really funny and exciting. I am definitaly going to read more of his books and watch the tv show if it's ever on anymore. I think triston is hilarious. I would reccomend reading this; it was great.
0743454537|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me, and I just couldn't say enough good things about it. I cried at least 4 times throughout reading.  It gives you such insight on each characther because each chapter is told by a different person and from their point of view.  Anyone who has sisters or even a heart will love this book!! The ending is what made me cry harder than any movie I have ever watched....it is a moving story...I loved it!!!
B00006IUL2|4.0|Let me correct \\"cherubino\\", the previous reviewer of this DVD. Although the voices are dubbed over the actors, the voice of Medea IS that of Callas herself! I suspect that the dubbing was done due to the external noise that might have got into the recording when filming was taking place. But it is the voice of Callas that we hear on this film. Just a pity that the dubbing was not done very well, as we do see discrepancies between the mouth movements and the sound that is coming out.

The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that \\"climatic ending\\" where the apples all topple - Not there!

B00005JO20|2.0|I was really excited when I first saw the preview for this movie.  I love King Kong and adore Peter Jackson.  From the previews I knew that the effects would be fabulous.  When I saw the movie I couldn't believe how disappointing it was.  This movie is the perfect example of how great effects do not make great movies.  EVERYTHING was overdone.  Jack Black isn't my favorite actor, but he was really over the top in this film.  Talk about overacting!  Geesh!  That sort of melodramatic, pompous acting may work in movies like The School of Rock, but it just made him look like a bad actor in this movie.  Secondly, nearly every scene was too long.  It took a full hour just for the cast to get to Skull Island.  Come on!  An hour!  Most of the movie, we are focused on Jack Black's character and not on Kong or the girl.  There was also a throw-in, unrelated relationship between two characters on the boat crew that served absolutely no purpose in the movie, other than to add filler and time.  There were too many excessively long shots with huge insects, dinosaurs and the like that didn't move the story forward in any way.  Don't get me wrong, it was exciting, but only for the first few minutes of the scene.  But the scenes just dragged on and on.  Just when you thought they must be done, here comes another scene with monstrous bugs or dinosaurs.  The sequence where Kong protects Ann from the T-rex was beefed up to include 3 T-rexes and lasted over 20 minutes.  Even the island natives were so feral and overdone that they were entirely unbelievable (and an insult to genuine indigenous peoples all over the globe).  It was completely over the top.  I did enjoy the sequences with Kong and Ann (minus most of the T-rex attack), and New York at the end was OK.  But overall I felt that I lost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.  I'm really glad that I borrowed this one from the library and didn't have to spend any money to see it.  I wouldn't bother to see it again and willnever recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I even gave it 2 stars was because the effects and sound were stellar.  Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody were also wonderful.  Too bad they weren't in more of the movie.  Don't waste your money.
B000G75AE8|1.0|Christ Illusion's artwork is one of Slayer's best. However, besides the artwork,the 10 songs offered here sound pretty much like the 13 songs featured in the predecessor God Hates Us All. Christ Illusion, it seems, was put together by taking the God Hates Us All's left over songs, and pasting a few senseless lyrics--Slayer's worst lyrics yet.    When I read other reviews regarding Christ Illusion People say \\"Wow the production, wow Dave Lombardo is back, wow Christ Illusion's fast, and wow Christ Illusion has great lyrics\\" But I say, \\"What are you blowing out of your oral cavities\\"?  First of all, the production is good--not exceptional but good--because, as you may have noticed, Slayer are rich, and they have a contract with American Recordings which is a major! Wake up kids!!! Second, Lombardo has gained this god-like status because in the 80's he pushed the envelopes of metal drumming when performing Reign In Blood; however, it occurs to me that today is the year 2006--20 years later Reign In Blood--and drumming techniques have dramatically developed. In other words, there are several thousands of drummers out there who largely surpass Lombardo on speed, power, and perfection. If you want real drummer, listen to Richard Christy, Tony Laureano, Derek Roddy, George Kollias, Paul Bostaph, Matt Rizzo, and... well the list will never end. Third, as far as \\"fast\\" goes it is not as they are playing fast for the first time right? And fourth, read God Hates Us All's lyrics, and then tell me if Christ Illusion's lyrics are any different.    Major companies such as Roadrunner Records, American Recordings, Warner Brothers, and others own bands. They exploit the concept of \\"underground music\\" making you believe that metal music is still pure and free from any kind of bonds.  Also, major labels dictate to their bands how to dress, behave, and what to say when interviewed. Don't you understand that tricks such as Tom Araya declaring to be a Christian, and not being bothered bythe blasphemous lyrics he sings are just slimy marketing strategies intended to make your hormones go wild and ask your mommy 20 bucks to go to Virgin Mega store and buy Christ Illusion? Please open your eyes and understand that Slayer wants your money. Understand that Slayer has nothing more to offer to the metal scene--they are finished. Tired. Bored. I love metal music and I loved Slayer. I loved Show No Mercy, I loved Hell Awaits, and I loved Reign in Blood. I am not saying that the other Slayer's albums ought to be banned from music, but don't tell me they are \\"underground metal masterpieces\\" that they \\"own\\" or other slangy amenities that you kids come up with nowadays.     When I go to the record store to buy a CD, I am aware--unlike you kids-- of the fact that my money is alimenting the fat marketing machine, and that I am making rich people even richer. However, I have no bosses, certainly no gods, and no idols. When a band I love starts making poop, I cut the umbilical cord without any hesitations; on the other hand, you kids do not know when to stop. You become sentimentally attached to that band and buy every album they put out--even if they will record nothing but farts.
0780619951|4.0|It is sad and fascinating that so many reviewers could not only not enjoy this interesting adaptation of the Wells novel but were upset!! It probably depends on what one got out of the original novel. Wells wrote a tragedy and this film underscores that folly is at the root of both tragedy and comedy.  <br /> <br />Moreau plays God in his dream of engineering a super race. But he is imperfect and his creatures are only thinking beasts. Thus he must theatrically play God to them in order to control his failures. This is a metaphor for the human condition and it is a disturbing fact to face that whether or not there is a God, religion has always been used by elites to control people. <br /> <br />Moreau has trapped himself in a tragedy which is an absurdity. It is a kind of maddness that might be portrayed as horror, or tragedy, or comedy. This film tries to put them all together, which is very interesting, but will not work for everyone and might just seem confusing, and then all the technical flaws pop out -- but I only take off one star for them.  <br /> <br />I give it four stars for being interesting and for some memorable performances. Trapped in this mad mess and in isolation Brando and Kilmer that they were led to by their idealism they have gone off the deep end and have become transformed from men of science into characters totally involved in their dream gone mad. Right, you can't tell that Kilmer was ever a brilliant neurologist -- that is the point. That is the horror, he has become a comical character. <br /> <br />There is a bit of this is Bridge on the River Kwai. Guinness is so swept up in his dream of showing British \\"can do\\" that he forgets he is helping the enemy. He is a tragic figure, but one can almost laugh and say \\"what is that clown doing\\" as he inspires his men to build the bridge. Harrison Ford in Mosquito Coast similarly is a tragic/comic person in pursuing his dreams. <br /> <br />If you follow the concept of the film closely, Brando andKilmer and this film do a better job at mixing the tragic and the comic.  And the film is an opportunity to think about broader social and historical issues if one is so inclined, though not so much about human nature per se as the above. Of course not everyone is!! If the world we live in sometimes seem mad, to what extent is this because it is so much the product of grand dreams gone sour? A lot, if you think about it. <br /> <br />It is often said that Wells wrote science fiction, serious literature that is, not escapist science fantasy. Moreau is sort of the Frankenstein theme, which is a serious one, but with religion thrown in, which added newer layers.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|Fabulous Album.  Unique and interesting work.  Josh Rouse is honest, uncomplicated, and unpretentious in 1972.
B0002W18MU|4.0|American V: A Hundred Highways is the final installment of the late Johnny Cash's five-volume collaboration with Rick Rubin, the producer of Cash's American series.  Rubin actually completed work on this CD after Cash's death, and Cash did not have the opportunity to edit or re-record anything that he may not have liked on this CD.  Possibly as a result, this CD is not quite as good as American IV: The Man Comes Around, though it is still worth purchasing.<br /><br />Like the previous installments, A Hundred Highways is primarily acoustic music and only the barest of remixing of Cash's voice, so it will be a shock if your main exposure to Cash has been his work in the 1950s and 1960s.  This also continues a trend of Cash's musical selections becoming more introspective and somber as his days on Earth dwindled.  This is not Johnny Cash as rebel, despite Rubin's purchase of an advertisement shortly Cash's posthumous awards at the Country Music Association showing an old photograph of Cash flipping the bird to an audience.  Instead, this is Cash as a religious man who has recently lost his wife and is preparing to meet his maker.<br /><br />Slate.com has a piece calling this CD campy because it of the focus on Cash's then-impending death.  I have listened to this CD several times, and while I don't like it as much as American IV: The Man Comes Around, I cannot understand how someone could call it camp.  Cash's voice is authentic and at times emotional, and there's no sign of a dramatic and artificial demeanor that would make this camp.<br /><br />The CD is generally slow and introspective, with Cash only recording two pieces that he had written himself.  The first, 'Like the 309,' is in my mind the best, and Cash singing about his casket being laid into the 309 train is moving.  The second, `I Came to Believe,' is more of a shadow from `The Man Comes Around' from the previous album.  As on American IV, the strongest pieces are written by someone else, and Cash shows no timidity in working with pieces originally recorded in other genres.  That said, the best song on this CD, 'God's Gonna Cut You Down,' goes back to Cash's roots singing traditional Gospel songs.  This song also highlights a more recent trend in Cash's religious music in that it portrays a vengeful Old Testament God instead of the more optimistic and forgiving New Testament version.  At the same time, like the rest of the CD, `God's Gonna Cut You Down' stays faithful to a deeper theme in much of Cash's early and late music in that it is a work based on the darker and seamier aspects of human nature.<br /><br />A second excellent song on this is Hank Williams' 'On the Evening Train,' which features a man singing about the death of his wife, a particularly poignant theme considering that June Carter Cash had died immediately before the recording of this album.  `On the Evening Train' is the most obvious in a series of lyrics on this CD that gain added meaning when you consider the man singing them, which adds to the power of this work.<br /><br />Other pieces on the album, such as Bruce Springsteen's 'Further On Up the Road' and the final piece, 'I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now,' are good, although I doubt that they will emerge as break-away hits from this CD.  Overall, this is a strong album, though hardly Cash's finest.  The CD as a whole has a feeling of Cash closing the book on his life, and it stands as a fitting final chapter for the Man in Black.h pieces originally recorded in other genres.

B00012QM8G|5.0|English is not my first language but oh well , I wanna write this review anyway!  <br />I read many reviewers say about the inacuracy of Schidler's story. Personally I think \\"Who gives a sh...t about that\\"?  <br />The messege of the movie is \\"Schindler saved lots of jews\\" ...This is all We wanted to learn. <br /> <br />Some reviewers were saying that...Schindler saved jews for his own benefit (I think that is not true anyway). Even if that is true .....again ... \\"Who gives a shi....t if he saved jews for his own benefit . All we know is at least about 1000 jews didn't die because of Schindler? We should Thank to Schindler anyway!  <br /> <br />Some reviewers were saying about the MORALITY. Then why do you people ask Spilburg about the morality? Why don't you people ask this question to the Nazis? They are the one who killed miilions jewish!  <br /> <br /> <br />This movie teaches me so many things. Teach me to give and not to be \\"too\\" greedy and also care for another people. Unlike another movie that you just watch and laugh and that's it ....doesn't give you much back. If it is not because of this movie ....Maybe in this life I would never know a man named \\"SCHINDLER\\" <br /> <br />Anyway, enough with my horible English. Last thing I wanna say is ...THIS MOVIE IS GREAT! WATCH IT !!!! YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH FROM THE MOVIE! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JO9J|5.0|I watched the first episode and was hooked.. cannot stop watching it on TV every week.  I am buying the second season also and will recomend it to everybody.  It is real life, real stories, real drama, etc...  This is the only show I can say that I would watch over and over again.  All characters are good.  They are funny, interesting and never boring.  It keeps me entertained and cannot wait for the next episode to come on the air.  Buy it now and you won't regret it
B0000029GA|5.0|I like the rap from the westcoast and the eastcoast. The whole eastcoast-westcoast thing doesn't bother me. I just love the rap from both. Nas's debut album Illmatic is a true eastcoast classic and quite possibly the best of the eastcoast. Nas's lyrical skills are amazing and the production of this is superb. Don't be put off buying this because there's only 10 tracks. Well you see, that's a good thing. If a rap CD has lots of tracks then the chances are its gonna have filler, when an album has around 10-12 tracks the chances are you can jam it in your CD player and not hit the skip button once. Its about quality not quantity. All the tracks on this are classics, in my opinion there is no best track, they are all so good that you just couldn't chose. Though probably my most played tracks would be NY State Of Mind, Life's A B**** and It Ain't Hard 2 Tell.  <br />There are only a few five star rap albums out there and this is certainly one of them. Do not allow yourself to miss hearing it for any longer
0790732203|4.0|This is again one of those movies that has been hyped up for years as a classic, often played in edited form on Cable movie channels, and is recognized as the birth of the monster that is know as Cruise.  The story of a high school kid from a well off family said \\"what the heck\\"...well, different 4 letter word. But, every kids dream was having the house alone.  Party time.  Good kids would stay at home board and dreaming, bad kids would throw the party.  Well, this movie was the changing of that good kid to the risk taking bad kid. Playing on the fantasy life of many young men, Joel is a Senior in high school trying to get to college and \\"walking the line\\" at home to not dissapoint his patents.  Well, when their away, peer pressure gets the best of him and he make a call out of the personals for a \\"date\\"...and the rest is history.  From thier his life take a nose dive. Can he save it?   Well, the fantasy plays out and walla, he get into princton. Its how he gets their is fun. Probably the best acting from Tom Cruise in his life, Just honestly looking back went down from here.  And the rest of the cast was good as well.  A dark comedy, but funny at times. Worth a watching.
0805066691|5.0|While there was apparently never any American \\"Wannsee Conference\\" to determine the fate of the Native Americans as there was for the Jews of Europe, to call the destruction of the American Indian a \\"Holocaust\\" is right on the mark: \\"The only good Injun is a dead Injun.\\" Dee Brown's 1970 book exploded the commonly-held myths of America's native peoples as bloodthirsty savages with a force that is still felt today. (This reviewer will generally use the non-PC term \\"Indian\\" because Brown does, and because hyphenated PC terminology is more irritating than enlightening.)<br /><br />Brown briefly recounts the earliest Columbian contacts between the Tainos and the Spanish (including enslavement) and gives us a very short synopsis of the fate of the Indians living east of the Mississippi (plague and butchery). The main bent of BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE however, concerns the destruction of the western tribes, particularly the Plains Indians, between 1860 and 1890. In one generation, White Americans managed to decimate what had been a proud and unique culture, leaving the few survivors just fragments of their past.<br /><br />The intensity of BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE is such that by only page 70, a recitation of the Sand Creek Massacre, this reader was already in tears. America's sad record with the Indian consists of broken promise after broken promise, one shattered treaty after another, and a view of the Indian as vermin fit only for extinction.<br /><br />To be fair, not all Whites were so inclined. Frontier soldiers frequently refused to fire on unarmed women and children, faced courts-martial, and reported abuses to the War Department at the cost of their reputations. Some Indian Agents fought tenaciously to hold the authorities to their treaty promises. But even the friends of the Indians were often forced at bayonet point and with the threat of the noose to work on behalf of anti-Indian forces. That most military commanders and civil authorities of the era were predisposed by nurture to despise the Indians is less surprising than the intensity of their hatred, which is often astonishing. Tale after tale of deception, theft, starvation, rape, child-slaughter, atrocity against the living and the dead, and mass punishment for minor crimes fill these pages. In one representative incident against the Santee Sioux, President Abraham Lincoln himself pardoned most of more than 300 Indians destined for hanging. Those who were hanged included (\\"regretfully\\" as the local military commander noted) several Indians who had been pardoned and others who were not charged with any crime and had actually saved Whites from death.<br /><br />Though there was no law or Presidential proclamation that enshrined the destruction of the Indian as an American goal, the elimination of the Indian Nations was a corollary to westward expansion. In effect, the Indian was treated by the Great Father and his Council in Washington with malignant neglect. Most White abuses went unpunished. The frenzied slaughter of the bison (4 million in two years) cleared the range for cattle and sheep and destroyed the buffalo-based culture of the Sioux, the Cheyenne, and other tribes. Brown documents how even the Modoc tribe of California, a threat to White hegemony at 300 strong, was decimated by the U.S. Army when the Modocs refused to go to the reservation chosen for them by these same Whites.<br /><br />That the Indians struck back is not surprising at all. Fortunately, Brown avoids creating a polemic by refusing to cast the Indians as noble savages. Instead, BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE honestly portrays them as flawed human beings who miscalculated, often being too trusting of White promises, but sometimes being too rash in reprising against White settlements that were uninvolved in military adventures against them. It was often the case that Indian warriors would attack a White settlement and kill some inhabitants, only to return to trade peaceably not long after, an ambivalence which marked their interactions with (and was accepted by) other Indians. Some were turncoats and betrayed their fellows. There were inter-tribal rivalries and traditional enmities that pitted the Indians against each other and in alliance with Whites (Brown mischaracterizes all White-allied Indians as \\"mercenaries\\" without documenting this supposed fact). Intra-tribal power struggles existed which often forced men to actions which they themselves thought ill-considered. More frequently than not the Indians were prone to failure because they never could grasp the force and nature of the tide against them. Local reprisals simply brought more \\"Bluecoats.\\" Peace entreaties to the United States forces were scorned as temporary expedients by those who believed in Manifest Destiny, much as negotiations with today's terrorists are exercises in pointlessness.<br /><br />It appears, time and time again, that the worldviews of White and Indian were so far apart that neither could understand the other's motivations. Whites wanted to rule the continent and order it, linearly, to their fashion. The Indians understood that the natural world was not to be so ordered, and chose to maintain their non-linear lifestyle and customs. Both sides appeared duplicitous to the other. The Whites broke their word with stunning regularity, a practice that engendered the same reaction from the Indian tribes. Had the two sides been more evenly matched American history might have been much different, but the overwhelming force and numbers of the Whites could not be withstood (it is said that as much as 90% of the Native American population died of European-borne pandemics between 1492 and 1550). In 1890 there were 62 million European-Americans. The 'feared' Indian tribes never numbered more than several tens of thousands in the western U.S., and these were subdivided into numerous local bands and clans. By the time they forged workable alliances, their time was effectively over. However, in those tumultuous final years not only did the Indians raise up some great war leaders, they also produced a bumper crop of reasoned statesmen whose words move the modern reader profoundly.<br /><br />Today, memorials to the Indians consist mostly of place-names on the map. It is far too little. What was lost to America when the Indian was all but exterminated is beyond evaluation. At the time of its publication the well-researched BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE was a first step toward redressing the balance, and it is a step that every American of whatever stock, must take.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Last saw this movie 10 years ago and it still rocks.Plus my teenage kids loved it
B00005NC66|4.0|What interests me is Truffaut's and Godard's very simple story is its ability to convey the nihilism of the main characters.  I believe it deserves at least as much attention as any of the evolutionary film making leaps that went into the film making.    The story is simple enough: Michel Poiccard (Jean Paul Belmondo) is a petty thief whom within the first five minutes of his appearance on screen has the cops on his tail because he has stolen a car.  Not being particularly bright, he shots the patrolman who pulls him over and leaves the scene of the crime rife with incriminating evidence.  The rest of the film, some eighty odd minutes consists of Michel chasing down money owed to him from earlier petty crimes; trying to keep one step ahead of the police and know what they know of his whereabouts; hanging out with and trying to sleep with Patricia Francini (Jean Seaberg), an American student at the Sorbonne and sometime writer for the Herald-Tribune--one gets the impression that the reason she is with him is that it is artistically inspired slumming for a novel she is working on.  It is Patricia who will ultimately betray Michel when her future in Paris is threatened by possibility of the loss of her visa and passport she willingly leads the police to him.  While they are still partners we are given an interesting look at the Paris underworld.    The world of petty thievery and the criminals on the margins of society who are the primary subject of Breathless were a group that Godard was in a good position to expostulate upon.   Having become totally obsessed with cinema while he was student at the Sorbonne, ostensibly studying ethnology, he was cut of from his families finances when they found out that ostensibly meant not at all and he had to subsist through petty theft.  The film--working often as a biography of Michel--shows a world of inactivity.  We see him sleeping, trying to put together the money that is owed him, comparing clothes with other petty thieves and trying keep Patricia amused and hopefully in bed.  He has absolutely no short term goals and his one ambition, going to Italy is little more than a pipe dream and is totally unrealistic.  Michel lives in a world that is totally sensory and sensual.  There is nothing about his character that suggests he could go beyond this, or that he wishes to.  Even worse than his sloth, is the fact that he is a total moral bankrupt: his code of conduct is so totally self-interested and egocentric as to be frightening.  In a word, it is degenerate.    Patricia is Michel's counterpoint in the film and though she comes from a different class background and has long term goals that presumably are not parasitic--being a journalist and novelist--she is just as morally repugnant as he is.  Although bright, intelligent and well educated she is totally self-absorbed.  As Dwight Macdonald  points out about the bedroom scene between Patricia and Michel \\"...it becomes evident, through many small touches of dialogue and expression, that each lover is so bound by childish ego as to be unable to make contact with the other, that they are emotionally impotent.\\"  Patricia's self-centeredness can be seen in her reading of Faulkner to Michel and insisting on its beauty (he does not speak English) her constant changing of facial expressions in the mirror and her insistence that Michel acknowledge the beauty of a Renoir reproduction that hangs on her wall.  Neither are trying to connect with the other on any but the most superficial level.  They are simply using each other.  It may not be evil, but it certainly is amoral.    Two amoral characters would not be all that threatening, but as Pauline Kael points out, what makes the film so disturbing is just how little the characters give a damn about anything.  \\"This new race lives for the moment because that is all that they care about.\\"  The group of people Michel is representative of are marginal and have no stake in society, do not accept the tenets of loyalty or even a code of conduct going beyond meeting and satiating immediate wants.  Patricia is just as dangerous for different reasons though.  Although she has of vision of the future for herself \\"she is so free that she has no sense of responsibility of guilt....  The codes of love and loyalty...depend on stronger emotions than her idle attachment to this lover....\\"  People like this represent a danger to society that goes beyond their numbers because the damage they can do is totally out of proportion with their numbers.    What finally makes Breathless so unique amongst underworld films is its differences from the gangster films that preceded it.  Michel is almost a polar opposite Rico Bandello.  Where Rico is chaste, Michel is a fornicator.  Where Rico is obsessed with power and making it, Michel could care less as long as there are cars to steal and fun to be had.  They both ultimately are brought down by their big egos and stupidity though.
B000G759LW|5.0|This CD is great! Disk 1 includes some Hip/hop R&B flavors  while disk 2 is about experamenting and having fun with some old styles which worked well for Christina since her voice is so amazing. Most of the cd is good. There might be 2 or 3 songs I skip over which is good considering there are more then 20 tracks on the album. This is worth every penny! I'm sure anyone who wasn't a fan of Christina before might change their minds after listening to this CD! A+
B00005JGAF|5.0|OK, I know I'm slow.  Still updating my 'vinyl'.  This CD is EXCELLENT; even better with the xtra tracks. <br />All Ramones are kickass; and yes, I think the Spector album is great too.
0671027387|4.0|A male scholar and a beautiful, brilliant woman. Very familiar set-up. In spite of Dan Brown's similar construction of character interaction and dynamics in his books, I'm still very entertained by his stories and can't put his books down. This book would make a great movie, as long as Tom Hanks isn't cast as the head of the NSA! The political sideshow adds fervor to the NASA/NSA conspiracy.
0140143505|4.0|What I loved most about this story was how diametrically opposite Hanff and Doel are. Hanff is your stereotypical brash New Yorker, while Doel is a staid Englishman straight out of an 1800's novel. Despite this valley of differences, they are able to forge a friendship based on their love of books. The story as one can gather from the other reviews, is told through the letters exchanged between Hanff and Doel. <br /> <br />Throughout the story, we also get a picture of postwar Britain and New York. We learn about the struggles and triumphs of Hanff and all the staff at Marks and Co. We see the main characters face the inevitabilities of growing older and taking on more responsibility, whether it be kids or a new home.  <br /> <br />The fact that Hanff is able to tell such a full and rich story through only correspondence is a feat indeed. I would encourage all to go and read this one.
0393317552|5.0|Well-researched and very well-presented. A must read for the innately inquisitive. This book really drives the determinism vs. free will debate. Outside factors were probably very much responsible for the development of human culture and techonology in some parts of the world and NOT in others.     Diamond explains how the presence of native plant and animal species and their domestication led to the rise of various societies throughout the globe. The presence of such resources gave way to advancement in civilization unparalleled in areas of the globe lacking in plant and animal species that lacked potential for domestication. Domestication led to the production of food by specialists (i.e. all members of a society not producing their own food as in hunter-gatherer societies). This freed other members in the society to specialize in other endeavors: skilled labor, warfare, politics, writing etc. Metallurgy was born and man harnessed the metals in the earth to create new superior metal tools and weapons. The result was a rise in power in some areas of the world with others lagging behind still hunting and gathering as nomads. Domestication led to permanent settlements, population growth and technology explosions. Permanent settlements harboring people and animals in close quarters led to the proliferation of infectious disease. These new higher societies waged warfare on lower societies bringing their metal weapons and germs to the battlefield. The germs, coupled with superior warfare technology secondary to the ability of certain members of society to specialize as full-time soldiers meant the undoing of primitive hunter-gatherer societies and the rise of empires. Eventually, the empires wiped out or pushed lower societies into the remote corners of the globe.    A tortuous chain of events leading to the rise of specific civilations is unraveled before your eyes by Jared Diamond, who has spent years traveling and researching his topic. He includes facts from multiple disciplines as well as hypothetical syntheses of the facts. However, he is careful to differntiate between scientific data and logical speculation, cautiously synthesizing his theories without hesitating to point out the gaps in data. In other words, he's a careful thinker who does not attempt to persuade the reader to buy into conclusions based on moot conjecture alone.    This is a truly fascinating book. It appeals to many disciplines. I found it to be a blazing page turner.
B000FGGE68|1.0|I was looking forward watching this movie. I truly was... <br />I'm totally into movies like Aeon Flux, Matrix and Equilibrium but this one sucks...sorry guys but I was really disappointed. <br />It's a waste of time...and money. Especially the SFX scenes are poor...dialogues are confusing and it's a waste of such good actors like Milla Jovovich. <br />Watching on your own risk. <br />Tom
0312995423|4.0|Very good book. Another Dan Brown page turner. I didn't find it as intriguing as DVC and A&D; however, we all assume that there are technological secrets being covered up by our government. The possibility of secrets being covered up by the Vatican that, if released, would unravel Christianity seems more earth shattering to me. Nonetheless, this book was very entertaining. I'm not an encryption wizard, so I guess my relative ignorance in the field allowed me to be entertained!
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Even though the movie is billed as a cult flic supposedly full of horror and violence, it is in fact a very sweet tale of coming to age with a obligatory happy ending. Since it is a Japanese movie, it is full of turning people into sushi scenes obviously, but this is as expected.<br /><br />I would suggest to not to watch it with kids as some scenes could be misinterpreted; for example it is hard to explain that hacking someone with a icepick could be a positive experience for all parties involved.<br /><br />As expected, icing on a cake is Chiaki Kuriyama, the scene where she finishes a boy in a very deserving way after he makes a couple of lewd comments will bring much joy to hearts of feminists worlwide.<br /><br />Rated 5 out of 5, must have for all Japanese cinema aficionados.
0385504209|5.0|I grew up in a legalistic Christian household (most members have renounced such madness, thank goodness). I wonder why my Sunday school teacher never suggested that Mary Magdalen (the purported harlot) was perhaps the wife of Jesus?? Amazingly enlightening!! One certainly cannot accept all that Brown asserts as fact. To do so would not be very scientific; however, the alternative explanations he alludes to are definitely more plausible than those offered by contemporary religious institution. This book was a blazing page turner and very thought provoking. I'm now getting \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", \\"The Templar Revelation\\" and others. Thanks Dan for sparking my interest!!
B000B0QOJA|5.0|If you like the later, freer, more open works of John Coltrane then you will absolutely love this album. It is hard work though, and not for the uninitiated. It requires a decision to engage oneself with this incredible musician, to open your spirit and allow his music to effect, move and change you. If you are jumping in to John Coltrane for the first time, I do not suggest that you start here. May I suggest earlier works like 'Soultane' or 'Bluetrane' as jumping in points.
B000G759LW|4.0|I've always respected Christinas voice, but this cd takes it to an entire new level. <br />She is incredible.
B000G759LW|5.0|I've admired Christina's voice for a very long time, but don't care much for hip-hop so never considered buying her CDs before. I can't even remember what it was about this one that caught my attention, but I went out on a limb and bought it. Great choice! Both CDs are a great mix of R & B, soul and pop and all tracks gave her a track to really show off her voice while paying tribute to the genres that contributed to her success. Listen to the samples and decide for yourself, but I highly recommend Back to Basics to anyone who admires a flawless voice, some interesting lyrics and some great music.
1932100385|5.0|On January 21, 2006, the day I started eating according to guidelines given in The China Study, I was 63 years old, 5 feet 10 1/2 inches tall, weighed 213 pounds and with a BMI of 130 was on the first rung of being obese, even though I did not look it.  The first week I lost 5 pounds, the 2nd 5 pounds, the 3rd five pounds, the 4th 4 pounds, then 3, 2, 1, until I lost 35 pounds in about 3 months and then stabilized at about 178 pounds.  My blood pressure went from an average of 141 over 91 to an average of 120 over 81.  My total cholesterol went from over 200 to 127.   I no longer feel that I am on a slow decline from 50 years onward, but feel happy and alive now.  Much like when I was a kid.  Today is August 22, 2006 and I know that this will be the way I eat and live for the duration.  For me it's a matter of survival, physically and spiritually.  I have given over 20 copies of the book to people I care about, including a waitress at an Outback Steakhouse in Virginia.  It was May; she was worrying about her dad and wanted to get him something for Father's Day.  By the way steakhouses are a great place to get real yummy vegetables.  This is my true story.  By the way, thank you Dr. Campbell and Thomas Campbell.
0887307280|5.0|This is an awesome book.  It had been recommended over and over to me, but it took me about 5 years to get around to reading it.  I would have a lot more money in the bank if I had read it after the first recommendation!  Anyone who says negative things about this book is probably not a business owner.  This is the most useful book on business that I have ever read.
1591396190|5.0|Kim and Mauborgne have put into writing that which every CEO aspires to achieve, the concept seems surprisingly simple and is within everyones grasp, although putting the Blue Ocean Strategy into action would need a really good understanding of the material covered and several readings!!! Thanks to the authors vision they have shown us that business need not be a military campaign.
0812975219|5.0|I loved this book. Taleb shows how we are blind to the ways randomness affects our lives -- which matters a great deal in terms of how we should behave in the future. For example, should we try to get rich by emulating other people? If we know people who got rich from winning the lottery, it's obvious that we shouldn't try to emulate them -- their method of getting rich will not work for us (probably!). But what about \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" and such books, that explain how other rich people got rich? Taleb explains how various fallacies, such as survivorship bias, cloud our perceptions. Survivorship bias is, for example, you might see that lots of people got rich by taking risks average people aren't willing to take. But if you only see the \\"survivors\\", what you don't see are all the people who took risks and didn't get rich. Taleb talks about many other biases as well, such as the \\"Black Swan\\" -- the rare, totally unexpected event -- named for our subconscious belief that because something never happened, that it never *can* happen -- because every swan we've ever seen was white, we believe every swan we will ever see will be white... until we encounter a black one. He also talks about how we accord high status to people who succeed by randomness, and look down on those who fail by randomness -- as if they \\"deserve\\" it -- our brains are simply not designed to handle randomness. The book is full of lively stories of Taleb's trader friends, such as Nero, who makes $1 million a year, and John, the lucky fool who makes $10 million, but is unaware he is a lucky fool -- he doesn't know what risks he's taking, and thinks (like everyone successful) he is succeeding in the markets due to his own knowledge and skill. But he still looks down on Nero, who feels like a beta male. Until John blows up.  <br /> <br />For me, the biggest effect of this book is that I now think about all the histories that didn't happen -- both in my life and in the world -- and not just the one history that actually did. It is a weird way of thinking, but important, because it gets you thinking about, how could you have predicted what actually happened using only the knowledge you had at the time? Because you need to prepare for what is going to happen using only what you know now. And if that statement doesn't make any sense to you, it will after you read this book.

B000E33VWW|4.0|There's a scene in this movie where the Harper Lee character comes over to the Capote character and listens to him while he bangs on and on, drink in hand, about the trouble he's having with his book. This is after the premiere of the movie \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". With incredible patience, she asks him what he thought of the movie and even more incredibly, he doesn't seem to have even watched it. As she walks off, obviously upset, he murmurs to himself that he doesn't see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />A part of me felt that way about this movie. As talented a writer as Truman Capote may have been, if this portrayal is true to what he was like (and apparently it is), then I wonder how anyone could've stood to be in the same room as him for more than a minute at a time. The early days of celebrity worship maybe? I found him totally creepy and narcissistic on a level I have never seen before in real life or in fiction. It was all about him and even the man he lived with an assumedly was having a relationship with, seemed to mean little more to him than a piece of furniture. He's the sun and everyone else is just a mere planet revolving around him.<br /><br />But anyway. The movie is about how Capote, in researching his 'non-ficiton novel' \\"In Cold Blood\\", developed a relationship with one of the two convicted killers he is writing about. It's really difficult to determine whether he develops a genuine affection for one of the killers, called Perry Smith, or whether he's simply using him to get the information he needs for his work. I don't want to give away any plot details but even at the very end it doesn't seem any clearer and that just adds to the overall creepiness of the Capote character. That said, like a car crash, it was impossible to look the other way. It was creepily entertaining.<br /><br />Or should I say entertainingly creepy?<br /><br />And maybe THAT's what the fuss is all about. It would seem that Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabited the character of Truman Capote and even though he looks and sounds nothing like him in real life, he does both in this movie in a way that is almost scary and thus the Oscar he won is well deserved. I wouldn't want to watch this movie again (and so am glad I rented rather than bought it) but for Hoffman's performance if nothing else, I recommend everybody see it one at least once. This is what acting is all about - or at least should be.ough he looks and sounds nothing like him in real life, he does both in this movie in a way that is almost scary and thus the Oscar he won is well deserved.

B000FP2Z0S|4.0|I've listened to Rise Against for quite some time and they have never dissapointed me. When giving this album a first listen, it comes at you as almost a popular rock band that is like everyone else. A few more listens and you begin to get the idea of it. With the single off the album \\"Ready To Fall\\", it's a very catchy and powerful song. Which goes for most of the songs on the album. The acoustic, or semi acoustic song on the album, I was almost taken back if it was the actual lead singer. His voice almost sounds like the lead singer of STAIND. Now don't get me wrong, there are some musical influences, or so it sounds like within certain songs, like Pennywise. The album has its ups and downs but in the long run it is a great album. But mark my words, this is the album that will make them like every other mtv and over played radio band out there.
B000G759LW|5.0|While there are arguably a number of stunning pop chanteuse's on the market, in modern times there is one queen and that is nobody but \\"X-Tina\\". Through the thick and thin, Christina's rich, full vocals have always trumped Britney's sexualized vocals, Jessica Simpson's thin vocals leaving only P!nk as the major competition (who opts for a more balanced mix of rock and pop).  That, hence leaves Christina to reign supreme in modern times. Christina has left us, the music listening audience with so many treasures such as what will in the future be held classics such as \\"Genie In a Bottle\\", \\"What A Girl Wants\\", her stunning rendition of \\"Reflections\\" from Disney's Mulan, and the Grammy winning \\"Beautiful\\", perhaps her most poignant vocal performance ever.  BACK TO BASICS may not hearken back to Aguilera's hey day as yet the third of the Mickey Mouse Alumni to record a pop album during the pop explosion, but it presents the most soulful, polished Aguilera.  It makes you want to just totally remove any memories of her rebellious \\"Dirrty\\".  BACK TO BASICS presents Aguilera in the place where many say she should've been in the first place... the R&B/Urban side of Pop.  But none can deny that even on her heavily criticized, scrutinized STRIPPED album that Christina always gave it all that she had.  That is only elevated more so on BACK TO BASICS.<br /><br />Appropriately titled, BACK TO BASICS doesn't so much go back to Jazz or classic soul music as it does borrow from that music.  Sure, there are some vintage sounds, especially with the horns, but there is also plenty of fresh, 21st century sounds as well.  However, whether BACK TO BASICS was supposed to be anachronistic retro-soul/retro-jazz or just R&B maintaining that vintage sound and vintage soulfulness,  BACK TO BASICS is very effective in conveying that overall feel.  Furthermore, that retro feel occasionally is blatantly obvious on a track such as the fun \\"Candyman\\" which may be a bit corny by 21st century standards, but it is definitely no more cornier and just as fun as say \\"Goodies\\" (Ciara), \\"My Humps\\" (Black-Eyed Peas), or more modern \\"Do It To It\\" (Cherish).<br /><br />After the introduction, the album opens brilliantly with the gospel-tinged \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" which is what it is--- a mix between a gospel sound and the pure embodiment of 1950s and 1960s soul.  Aguilera's vocals are brilliant to say the least and she may not be Aretha, Billie, Sarah Vaughn, or Ella, but she certainly does a yeoman's job with her vocal performance.  The hits keep coming as Christina follows with the exceptional \\"Back In the Day\\" and the ubiquitous radio single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", which rivals Christina's best singles ever.  Maybe it won't stick like \\"What A Girl Wants\\", but it does trump the mildly received \\"Dirrty\\".  \\"Understand\\" is another stand out performance with a brilliant sample being employed with a very nice nuanced performance by Aguilera to match.  Futhermore, \\"Slow Down Baby\\" and \\"On Our Way\\" also set the mark for some of the best performances of the CD.  Disc 2 brings us the corny, but cool \\"Candyman\\" along with other notable standouts \\"Mercy On Me\\" and \\"The Right Man\\".<br /><br />The biggest drawback of this sure to be Grammy winning CD maybe that the two discs aren't necessary.  Why not just put it together as one? Is it a big deal, no, but one does wonder.  Overall the production is flawless as is the album for the most part with only the occasional stumble.  What is surely flawless is Aguilera's sultry, sprit-filled pipes which make BACK TO BASIC quite possibly her best album ever.  With that said, this is one of the few 4.5 star albums of 2006.ds, but it is definitely no more cornier and just as fun as say \\"Goodies\\" (Ciara), \\"My Humps\\" (Black-Eyed Peas), or more modern \\"Do It To It\\" (Cherish).   <br /> <br />After the introduction, the album opens brilliantly with the gospel-tinged \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" which is what it is--- a mix between a gospel sound and the pure embodiment of 1950s and 1960s soul.

B00003CXIP|4.0|When listening to Rob Reiner's commentary on the tragic story of what happened to River Phoenix, one can't help but be moved by the final scenes of this seminal 80's movie. I was a late teenager when I saw this and it clicked perfectly with memories of when I was a kid and had a bunch of buddies that did the normal kid stuff--going camping, riding bikes, getting terrorized by older kids!!!!  Anyway, I know I wasn't around during the time period this is set, but the basic themes are universal. Now I'm not going to bore you with a recap of the story--you can read that in another review. Let me just say that the four leads are incredibly natural and give fine performances, even Jerry O'Connell whose first film this is. And of course Kiefer Sutherland is wonderfully menacing !! (No  wonder he was a vampire in Lost Boys the next year!) I'm not sure the steady stream of profanity was necessary but then again, I wasn't around during the 50's so maybe that was par for the course. As someone elswhere mentioned, this is an adults kid movie. The dvd extras are fine--it's great to see the cast and director and Stephen King remark on the making of the film. Knowing this was King's favorite adaptation of his work really makes this more affecting. So relive those fun times as a kid if you have seen this before and watch it again. Especially if your an old timer like me--you know, all of 40 years old. And if you haven't seen it before--well, let me just say not to eat any pie before watching it!!!  See ya!!
B000AP04OM|5.0|No matter how sad I feel, I can watch this movie and remember that God is still around, as evidenced by the naturally beautiful scenery in this movie.  The hills are alive...so is my heart when I watch this magnificent scenery unfold before me. <br /> <br />Sister Maria is funny.  She makes me laugh whenever she answers so childishly casually but so brutally frankly.  She is so kind who could dislike her? <br /> <br />I first saw this movie in 1966 when I was ten years old.  I was very impressed by everything in the movie then, and  I am as impressed now at the age of 50.  I guarantee that this movie is still a winner after 40 years!  That is a fact that will never change.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|I rented this and my dad, my aunt and I watched it together and I must say my aunt was on pins and needles, she was incredibly into it. Yet there's reviews(like critic reviews) that suggests the film was tepid, overproduced and a summer blockbuster masquerading as an important tragic story of survival. It's really one of those kind of films that wants to be more than it is, even though it's got the visuals to convince you so.    Passengers on the cruise ship Poseidon are enjoying New Years' until a rogue wave smacks the ship and tips it over, making it float upside down, slowly flooding. The only way to get out is go up, which is in reality down towards the bottom of the ship. In their way stands a ton of water, small spaces and big stunts.    One thing that's starting to become better with Hollywood in regards to its effects is the lack of novelty to it. No longer are we going \\"holy [...], how'd they do that?!\\" like Jurassic Park or Terminator 2. Since we've seen it so many times, as well as the documentaries on it, we know how it's done so it no longer knocks us down but we can follow the story better. The wave scene definately impresses at its coolest but it's not as \\"whoa!\\" like it would be in the early 90's. Much of the film was done by real sets and stunts by the real actors so it's more impressive.     Where the film falls apart is its characterization. One character becomes rogue and wants to be alone until all of a sudden he gets into action hero mode while the mom is so inept at a mom that it's like \\"you mean she's still around?\\". Then there's one character that's super cute and I'm being biased but once she's gone, the film just kind of felt \\"meh\\". You can tell the filmmakers wants you to feel bad when someone dies but there's not much buildup to it(except for the cutie).    What is also disappointing is the extras for the 2-disc. I've seen single discs with more special features than this. Wolfgang Petersen's quite the info heavy when it comes to commentaries...there isn't one. The film apparently went through a severe edit to make the film seem quicker yet there's no deleted scenes. Expect a triple-dip sometime in the future.    If you are a fan of the film, I suggest waiting. You should rent it first just to...excuse the pun but \\"test the waters\\".
B000AQBA1W|5.0|I do not normally write reviews, unless I am overwhelmed to do so. The Corrs ~ Home has become my favorite CD in my collection of The Corrs (Corrs - Unplugged 2nd favorite) and I listen to it almost everyday. Every track on the CD is beautiful in vocals and arrangement....there is such a nice flow to the music that all the songs seem to fit together with emotional depth. I have been a fan of The Corrs for couple years now. I wish I would have known about them sooner, but unfortunately they did not get the radio airplay in the U.S.( not as much in the U.S. as Europe) that they so well deserved and their Concert DVDs (I own every one of them now) took awhile to get to the U.S., but definitely worth the wait.    Since owning this Cd I have purchased it for all the ladies in my family, my mom, aunts, memè... so that is three generations, and we all enjoy the music considerably. That alone speaks for itself!! I have to include my dad (100% proud Irish-man) he also enjoys the CD and we normally never agree on music (haha).     Sharon Corrs singing of \\"Dimming of The Day\\" is so well done, very touching and beautiful. I would love to hear more of Sharon's vocals on lead, she has such a beautiful voice. Where Andrea's vocals are sweet and clear, Sharon's vocals are emotional and beautiful.     I have to say this CD is a courageous move. The music on this album has opened my ears to a style of music that I would normally never seek out or probably would never have known of. I am used to the very commercialized pop sounds on U.S. radio and I am so glad that this CD moves away from that. It has broadened my range of musical tastes and I am so very thankful. The Corrs have proved themselves to be hard working, dedicated, crafted musicians and this album highlights their talents and Irish/Celtic roots, also a very brave move for them to move away from the mainstream. Thank you - to The Corrs for going outside of the norm and bringing us this Gem!! I LOVE IT!!
B000002UY5|5.0|This is an awesome debut album. It had been a few since I had put this one on, and it all came pouring back, just beautiful. Blnd Melon in my opinion has always been overlooked as just some obscure jam band,or a one hitter. But this band is so much more,and this debut release shows what a group of talented musicians these guys were.                                                              This band had such unique sound for it's time. Sure you could drag out all the infuence's here and there, but you would lose what is truly there. Songs like \\"Tones Of Home\\",\\"Change\\", and \\"No Rain\\" are inviting. While \\"I Wonder\\",and \\"Holyman\\" ring out like a folksy lullaby. This soundscape of blues/folk/rock is truly inspirational,and when it sink's in leaves an impression. Check out School House Rock, Woodstock 94',Live Like A Porcupine, and Enconium if you can't find enough B.M. Blind Melon fans will always be Blind Melon fans.
B00005JP4U|5.0|It's difficult to review this documentary. I want to tell you, share with you, everything that I learned and felt in this film, all of the humiliation, all of the senseless destruction of our environment over the last several decades, and the plummet that we have seen in the last eight years - currently caused by our administration, an administration that believes that global warming is that greatest hoax perpetrated on the American public in the history of our nation. Can I say DUH? Are there kindergartners making decisions at the White House? Oh. Pardon me. There are.    Please. They are idiots. And I am being kind. Our language, American English, doesn't posses words to describe their perfidy.     Gore wants us to see the horrors that we are shoving into our environment, and he shows a few clips of conservatives calling his environmentalism dumb.  Regan did it, Bush did it. When you look at their arguments, you have to realize that they are absolutely insane. Owls?  The elder Bush called Gore crazy, and said we would be neck full of owls and short on jobs. Wow. What a visionary. Thinking about it, he wasn't much brighter than his son.    Besides that...    Let's say that Gore's predictions are off by 100 years. The fact is that the planet will still suffer, and our progeny will bear the consequences. Is that what we want? Do we really want them to bear the fruits of our \\"labor\\"?    Of course not.    Unless you're a sociopath, that is.
B000GUJHIA|2.0|Much as I admire Judt's writing and breadth of knowledge, I'm appalled that he allowed this book to appear without source notes and bibliography, which are relegated to a website. I imagine this was a compromise he reached with the publisher to enable the publication of an overly long manuscript, but it renders the work largely useless to serious readers.

B000G759LW|4.0|Whether or not speakeasies are coming back, Christina Aguilera is just one of the many artists today bringing back a sound deeply rooted in the early 1900's. Back to Basics, Aguilera's third studio attempt from RCA Records, sheds all the immaturity and overt sexual nature of her second record Stripped and walks another level. The cues here are subtle and when the album wants to be sexy, it does not miss any targets.<br /><br /> If her late single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" is any hint that Aguilera is touching past influences and drawing forward, then songs \\"Oh Mother\\", \\"Without You\\", and the gospel-like \\"Mercy on Me\\" will fare no different. Back to Basics is unique, working with the likes of DJ Premier couldn't help; however, this album feels more for Aguilera than for her millions of fans.<br /><br /> On \\"Mercy on Me\\", Aguilera confesses \\"I can tell you what I've done/ or should I tell you where I went wrong?\\" followed by a wall kicking chorus beginning with \\"Oh Lord have mercy on my soul...\\"<br /><br /> Images of contempt for past histories don't let up, especially at first glance of the song's titles: \\"Save Me from Myself\\", \\"Hurt\\", \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\", and the even less ambiguous, \\"I Got Trouble.\\"<br /><br /> That's not to say the album is not fun. Au contraire!<br /><br /> Once Aguilera puts her own spin on things, albeit sounding like an early day Mariah Carey on a few tracks, Back to Basics jump starts into a small little get down. Aguilera wants to be intimate with her listener, letting them in on her blues or downward spirals yet fortunately for many, also her fun and more risqu&eacute; side.<br /><br /> Who's going to complain?<br /><br /> If the lyrics in her new single \\"Candyman\\" aren't considered sexy by everyone with reading comprehension skills, then the world has lost any meaning of immorality. When Aguilera jumps into the swing dancing chorus with lyrics \\"He's a one stop shop/ makes my cherry pop/ He's a sweet talkin' sugar-coated candyman\\", any rational male will be glad to quit their day jobs and help those with a sweet tooth.<br /><br /> Watch your men, ladies...<br /><br /> While the beats are DJ Premier's, the driving force is Christina Aguilera, who proves with Back to Basics that she is the top of her class in pop stardom. Instead of drawing on the ill fated pop-rock like today's Kelly Clarkson or becoming the next Avril Lavigne and trying out pop-punk, Aguilera pops in neutral and let's her guard down--without having one or two children in the process.<br /><br /> Critics may say this would have been better as a single disc, and they might be right; however, in a day and age where listeners tire easily over ten tracks, double albums might be the only way to go.<br /><br /> Although a bit too overzealous, Aguilera's Back to Basics is a smooth ride that should appease anyone and everyone who ever smiled at singing in church, or for that matter, singing in general.<br /><br /> Go, play!\\", any rational male will be glad to quit their day jobs and help those with a sweet tooth.  <br /> <br /> Watch your men, ladies... <br /> <br /> While the beats are DJ Premier's, the driving force is Christina Aguilera, who proves with Back to Basics that she is the top of her class in pop stardom.

0385338694|3.0|I was expecting something funny from the author but it never really quite made it. It was sort of boring in the beginning, I thought 'hey where getting somewhere' in the middle, and just made me feel bad for reading the whole book. I mean, how messy things got as it draws to an end. The character, Samantha, should have been more honest rather than running away from reality. I mean, the author should have made a dramatic end rather than a confusing one. Don't get me wrong, I love Sophie Kinsella as a writer and her other books.
B000001FRY|5.0|I should first dispense my bias-I practically grew up with u2.  The first rock cd (tape at the time, actually) was \\"The Unforgettable Fire.\\"  the second one, streamlining, was the multi-platinum follow up, \\"Joshua Tree.\\"  Many early tapes I had I have grown out of, but a handfull of them have too many childhood memories tagged onto them.  These two albums would fit the catagory.  Now I have them on cd.    Lately, though, I had become curious.  If Unforgettable Fire was such an amazing album, what would happen if I went backwards in time with the band (forwards I know is a slightly rocky road).  I purchased this album online along with War.  Both  of these cds have a similar sound.  Neither of them are particulary memorable, but have a sound you remember is just, well, good.  And, while I don't think the two later U2 albums could be topped in my book, these are must haves for anyone who likes U2 of any kind.  Is this anything like \\"The Unforgettable Fire?\\"  In someways, yes, in some ways, no.  To me, The Unforgettable Fire was to U2 as The Bends is to Radiohead-a gateway.  By the end of the 80's, U2 had morphed into a completely different sounding band than their nemisis of the early 80's.  Even \\"Joshua Tree\\" has a very different, in some ways, more mature sound than \\"Boy.\\"  \\"the Unforgettable fire\\" was a very trippy and historicly aware album, very different from anything they have done, but it is the most similar to the first three albums they have (I haven't heard October, but I assume the sound is somewhat the same as Boy and War since it comes between). What really sets Boy apart, though, is it's darker and sometimes sinister.  Just listen to #3 (can't remember how it's spelled) or \\"Into the Heart.\\"  Not to mention, \\"I will follow\\" has a far-away nostalgic auro to it that can't be put into words.  When the first chord of the song hit, I would describe the image at best that I get as a far away country eminating a signal.  I would recommend this to any u2 fan, especially those disappointed with newer releases, as well as any fan of 80's alternative.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|At the end of the 1960s, having had major success with his \\"Man With No Name\\" trilogy (starring Clint Eastwood), writer/director Sergio Leone was ready to give up westerns and try his hand at making some American productions.  His first project was to be ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA - which would finally be made and released in 1984 - but American studios wanted another western first.  Eventually, Leone was convinced to make another western, and another trilogy as well, set through different periods in American history.  Part two was to be GIU LA TESTA (a.k.a. A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE or DUCK, YOU SUCKER, released in 1971), and part three was to be ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA.  Part one was C'ERA UNA VOLTA IL WEST - ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, released in 1968. <br /> <br />ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is possibly the most epic western ever filmed, equalled in scale only by Leone's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.  The story, in simple terms, revolves around a beautiful widow (Claudia Cardinale), a mysterious man with a harmonica (Charles Bronson), a notorious desperado (Jason Robards), and a merciless assassin named Frank (Henry Fonda).  The man with the harmonica teams up with the desperado to protect the widow when the assassin Frank sets his sights on her.   <br /> <br />Though THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is Sergio Leone's masterpiece, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST ranks right behind it.  It sports, among many other things, some of the greatest camerawork in cinema history, ranging from intense close-ups to beautiful panoramas.  Of course, no Leone western - or film, for that matter - is complete without an Ennio Morricone score, and Morricone's music for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is quite possibly the greatest of the master composer's entire career.  Fittingly, it's also Morricone's most grand score, filled with a haunting female vocal and a razor-sharp guitar part for the man with the harmonica's theme. <br /> <br />It's quite fortunate that Leone chose a cast of great actors to play a group of very interesting characters; not that Leone ever had a hard time choosing perfect casts.  Henry Fonda makes Frank's ruthlessness completely plausible; he seems like an inhumane character and he is.  Claudia Cardinale, whom I was previously familiar with only from her role in Blake Edwards' THE PINK PANTHER, is absolutely gorgeous in this film.  She also made me a feel a little uncertain as to what the widow McBain would do next.  Jason Robards is the Eli Wallach of this film, making the criminal Cheyenne quite a likable character.  Most intriguing, of course, is Charles Bronson as the mysterious harmonica-playing wanderer.   <br /> <br />At 165 minutes, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST doesn't seem long.  Perhaps that's due to the wonderful visuals - Leone was always an immensely visual storyteller; or perhaps it's due to the mystery exuding from each member of the cast.  What we know for certain is that ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is one of the finest films ever made, not to mention one of the two greatest westerns of all time.  Though it wasn't his last great film, it was Sergio Leone's penultimate masterpiece before his directorial career ended, quite fittingly, with 1984's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA.
B000F4PD7G|5.0|What actually happen centuries ago in the cold North of Europe? Before the tale was told around a campfire about a hero named Beowulf and the monsters he defeated, there was a man, a warrior who lived and died. How did his story, handed down for generations in an oral tradition actually happen? The writer, director, cast and crew try to bring the man before there was a legend to life. They succeed largely as a result of the acting skills of Butler, Skarsgård, and Sigurðsson. Butler is a thinking-man's warrior who gets caught in a web of promises and deceit. As comprehension dawns, it is too late for Beowulf to save anyone -- the story must play out to an ending filled with revenge and death. The scenery is great; Iceland is breathtaking, the vistas even threaten to overwhelm the players and act as a dominant character in this beautifully shot movie. <br />Live actors, a great and timeless story, and plenty of food for though after the movie is over. Now that's entertainment!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie filled my heart with the amazing performance and chemistry of Keanu and Sandra.  Its for romantic people who wants to be inspired. I loved Jack also, I remembered my lovely gone pet. The house was beautiful, the photography was amazing.<br />I can't stop thinking about it, I recomend it all of you who are in love.  I'm waiting for the DVD !!
B0002S94OS|5.0|American metal is alive and well...and Lamb of God is living proof of that. Can one band singlehandedly save metal from the korn's and limp bizkit's of the world? The answer is a resounding YES! Ashes of the Wake is an absolutely flawless album. From the opening notes of Laid to Rest to the end of Remorse is for the Dead, the listener finds no pause or hesitation in this record. Chris Adler is the unquestioned star of Lamb of God. His drumming is brutal and relentless. Adler uses his foot pedals to alter the tempo of each and every song on multiple occasions. This album has inspired me to get back on my kit, the only other record that has moved me so much with it's drumming was Fear Factory's Demanufacture. Anyway, this album is an absolute must own for any fan of the metal genre. Standout tracks include Hourglass, Break You and Ashes of the Wake (a sick instrumental). This album is worth every penny. Lamb of God has picked up where Metallica left off 18 years ago with ...And Justice For All to save American metal.<br /><br />Tracks rated from 1-10:<br /><br />1. Laid to Rest (10/10)<br /><br />2. Hourglass (10/10)<br /><br />3. Now You've Got Something to Die For (9/10)<br /><br />4. The Faded Line (10/10)<br /><br />5. Omerta (9/10)<br /><br />6. Blood of the Scribe (9.5/10)<br /><br />7. One Gun (9/10)<br /><br />8. Break You (10/10)<br /><br />9. What I've Become (9/10)<br /><br />10. Ashes of the Wake (11/10)<br /><br />11. Remorse is for the Dead (10/10)
B0002BK9J4|4.0|Three albums had passed since the last great Ramones album, and even the faithful were getting worried. The Ramones' long time relationship with Sire had ended and they entered the studio with a new label and a strong sense of purpose. The result was a return to form, and set the band back on course for a resurgence. Starting with the anti-PMRC (remember them?) rant \\"Censors#!t\\", they crash through 13 very Ramonesy songs in a style that would almost be retro if they hadn't had invented it in the first place.<br /><br />Also worth a chuckle is the disc's closer, \\"Touring.\\" Ripping off their own \\"Rock And Roll High School,\\" Joey sends up the whole road show of rock with a wink and a power chord. It ends the disc on a note as giddy as the opener was politically snarling. \\"Mondo Bizaro\\" was The Ramones we had grown up loving, comfortable with their legacy and ready to take control of it once again.
B000002KY8|5.0|\\"1999\\" is often called Prince's \\"breakthrou\\" album but those of us in the r&b community had known about this prodigy since his 1st album, \\"FOR YOU\\" releashed in 1978.Heck, true Prince fans still remembered the time he was booed off stage, while opening for the \\"Rolling Stones\\". I guess America was'nt ready for something fresh and exciting at the time. But in 1983 apparrently it was.The first 3 songs \\"1999\\",\\"Lil Red Corvette\\", and \\"Delirious\\" get this album off to a roaring start and the party never stops!
B000002LND|4.0|As of late, but I do love her early stuff. CD is wonderful! When you think of early Madonna, you can play any of the songs on this CD and it will come up. <br />My only regret is losing this CD.
B000002KMV|4.0|I was a senior in high school when this album came out and I remember it like yesterday. This was before Prince really blew up and began to move away from his r&b roots in order to gain a bigger audience. Songs such as the orgasmic \\"Do Me Baby\\"(who can forget the obvious satisfied sounds of a young lady in the middle of this song),the upbeat \\"Private Joy\\", and the funky beat of \\"Lets Work\\" show a genius on the verge of superstardom.
B00005JP4U|5.0|This is truly a must-see movie!  Excellent!  I urge teachers to show it in the classroom as soon as copies are made available for purchase.  We must educate the next generation about the dangers of polluting the planet and exhausting our natural resources.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This is John Wayne in a more tender moment.  Tough guy is there but yous see a more tender Wayne as he falls in love....
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I found this version of my favorite novel to be very touching and romantic, though lacking much of the gently ironic tone that makes Jane Austen unique.  Mrs. Bennet, for example, was beautifully played by Brenda Blethyn, but she was rather more sweetly dithering than the constantly plotting, embarassingly outspoken character in the book. I did like the Bennet sisters' portrayals, though, and I found Darcy quite believable in his reserve and his almost painful discomfort in the rambunctious social milieu of Meryton.  The cinematography is superb, however, and the sets and costumes are flawless.  All told, the film fulfills the director's vision and gives the viewer a wonderfully intimate look at life in early nineteenth-century England.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|After \\"Clockers\\" I gave up on Spike Lee.  Even though he is a talented moralist, boring and rote is still boring and rote.  So it was with some trepidation that I picked up \\"Inside Man.\\"  Could he keep his predilections under wraps for once, the way Lynch did with \\"Straight Story\\"?  The answer is mostly yes.*  It's a great detective-drama-action movie, a whodunit with good characters and articulate plot twists.  Even people like me who have grown skeptical of Spike Lee's abilities would be pleased with the movie.<br /><br />*  He still couldn't resist totally gratuitous references to violent video games, white cop bigotry and proper gun safety.
B000EXZI1O|5.0|Note:  This is a re-issue until Rhino Records releases the Remastered Expanded version.<br /><br />In the difficult position of having to top \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", the Gibb brothers surpassed themselves and created their biggest hit studio album of their careers, including three more #1 hits, making six #1 hit songs in a row! \\"Tragedy\\", \\"Too Much Heaven\\" and \\"Love You Inside Out\\" were all top hit singles. \\"Spirits (Having Flown)\\" was a large hit single overseas. All songs are Barry dominated vocals and he is at his falsetto best. However, \\"Stop (Think Again)\\" is a tad long and a little bit tedious, but the following tracks go right back to their upbeat best! Succeeding in avoiding any dance songs (disco), the Bee Gees out-do themselves. These songs are truly funky \\"R & B\\" numbers, a solid match for any rythym and blues band. \\"Until\\", the closing solo track may not be equal to their earlier hit \\"Words\\", but Barry's voice accompanied by the electronic harpsichord makes for a delicious ending.
B000EPFVCS|4.0|Century Rain is a great hybrid of film-noir/detective/SF themes that marks a return to form. After greatly enjoying the authors earlier Revelation novels, I was slightly disappointed with Chasm City, which suffered from an uneven pace and other distractions.     In contrast, Detective Floyd and archaeologist Auger make for very compelling and believable protagonists in a suspense-filled storyline. The detailed setting of 1920's Paris was a welcome change from endless spaceships and alien planets so common to the SF genre. Overall Century Rain was an engaging and enjoyable read. I am very intrigued to see what Mr Reynolds writes next.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This musical is great!  My kids and I love this music and sing along with every song.  Highly recommended.
1401302378|5.0|Anderson's book is an excellent work of cultural and economic analysis.  He thorougly constructs his case that the market is trending toward niches, and explicates a fine model to examine these trends.  He also offeres wonderful practical advice to those who desire to take advantage of the \\"long tail\\" economy.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who is involved in the Internet as a part of their business, has a general interest in economics, or enjoys reading books about cultural trends.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|While the theatrical cut is still a very good movie, this director's cut is a superior movie. Free to include all the elements originally intended for the film, Ridley Scott has given us the movie that should have been released to theaters in the first place. <br /> <br />For those uninitiated on the story, Balian (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith in France, has just lost his child to stillbirth and his wife to suicide. Godfrey, Baron of Ibelin near Jeruselem, arrives to tell Balian that he is his father and would like for him to come to Jeruselem with him. This is where Balian's life takes a dramatic turn, and he is drawn into political and personal machinations the likes of which he has never seen before. <br /> <br />In the director's cut, the characters all have more depth, especially Sybilla (sister to King Baldwin in Jeruselem) whom we now see with all her political and personal aspirations. What drives all the characters really falls into place, and the impact is profound for all of them. <br /> <br />Visually, the movie is stunning and vivid, and the soundtrack is perfect for it. There are a couple key places in which the direction is a bit puzzling, though. For instance, in a couple of Balian's key speeches, the reaction shots of other characters leave you with the impression something more is coming, and it isn't. It makes those key moments a bit anticlimactic. But that's a small quibble, and it doesn't make the movie any less meaningful. <br /> <br />The acting is superb, and quite honestly, Orlando Bloom has been short-changed by a lot of critics, both professional and amateur. His character, Balian is not the Gladiator, and those expecting him to be are missing a vital point of the film. He is the character through whom we see the repercussions of following your conscience-- or not. You don't need to be a towering hulk of muscle or have an abundance of political charisma in order to make an impact, for the better, on the world. One ordinary person who stubbornly refuses to take moral shortcuts can change things. It's a heady theme. <br /> <br />With the fantastic acting across the board, and the story told as it was meant to be, this is a movie worth watching again and again. <br /> <br />The extras are fascinating, but don't expect too much more in the way of historical exploration; those were covered extensively on the theatrical release's DVD. This director's cut DVD does have a bit of historical discussion, but it's mostly the journey of making the movie, everything from costumes, to the sets, the weapons, and the casting. Speaking of casting, the bits on the extras where we get to see some early rehearsals are fascinating. The commentaries are a bit dry, but if you're a fan of them, there's some interesting information to be had here and there. The screenwriter, Monahan, comes off rather arrogant in places, but he did put together an overall amazing script, so it's forgiveable. <br /> <br />I really wish this cut of the movie had been on the big screen. It absolutely deserved to be.
B00005RHGK|2.0|I've seen a lot of horror movies in my life, both good and bad, but this takes the cake. I had hope for this movie because it was a rated R horror movie, but I was disappointed. Instead of chills, I had the giggles. This movie was so stupid that I could not stop laughing. Come on, a monster that no one can kill, has 23 days to eat whatever organs or body parts that you have that it wants? There was next to no plot to it, but it's like a train wreck..... you just have to look! Now if I ever want a good laugh I will buy this movie and the second one, but not as a horror movie. <br /> <br />I have to admit that the scene down that pipe was pretty cool. It had a lot of potential, and it reminded me of the catacombs and that one church that was on the history channel that was lined with skulls and bones. Other than that, I would put this movie in the comedy section, put then again I have a twisted sense of humor and find a lot of horror movies funny. I give it two stars for making me laugh my but off.
B000EXZI0K|5.0|Note:  This is a re-issue until Rhino Records releases the Remastered Expanded version.<br /><br />After the enormous come-back sucess of \\"Main Course\\", the Gibbs' followed with this album and the #1 'across the charts' hit \\"You Should Be Dancing\\". Arif Mardin could not produce for them again, due to record contractual conflicts. But, at the same time, Billboard magazine had just started a \\"dance\\" chart and this single topped it the summer of 1976. Followed closely to #3 was \\"Love So Right\\", a severe 'Stylistics' sound copy. \\"Boogie Child\\" surprised everyone with it's complex instrumental backing and the funkadelic vocals.<br />It was another step up for the Bee Gees. Again, with too many hits to release in a year, other artists like Melba Moore \\"You Stepped Into My Life\\" and an old Gibb friend Yvonne Elliman, \\"Love Me\\", snatched these songs up and made them their own giant hits. Radio Host Casey Kasem remarked during the showcasing of \\"Love So Right\\", that the Bee Gees have had more songs copied by any other artists, other than the Beatles! This was in 1976 before \\"Saturday Night Fever\\".!<br /><br />The title track made a big hit in Europe and several other tracks became concert staples. Who knew that the next studio album would be the biggest selling soundtrack of all time?<br /><br />\\"Children Of The World\\" is another amazing groundbreaker. History will probably never repeat itself like this again.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|This is the way more movies should be made! It shows excellent talent, has a lot of humor and is super intertaining. And under it all are some great lessons in curtesy, honesty and ethics! I feel good after viewing it.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|I'll let you know off the bat, I'm one of the fools who bought the re-cut trilogy on DVD from two years ago. I decided the changes didn't bother me too much, as long as Lucasfilm eventually released the originals on DVD as well. Well, now they are, except they're releasing them with the 2004 re-cuts that I, along with many others, already have. This is just a poor business decision. Remember back in 1997 when they rereleased these movies in theatres as \\"Special Editions\\" with new scenes, sound, and FX? Technically, there are three versions of each film: The original, 1997, and 2004. All they had to do was couple the originals with the 1997 special editions, then we would have all three versions to compare and contrast. That's it. No money wasted, all products exploited, and everyone's a happy customer. It's not brain surgery guys.
B000ETQR3Q|2.0|Compared to other Nerf 'blasters' this gun falls short.  The clip system is good enough in that you won't have to load the next six shots manually.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately this gun (mine - it's possible it's a fluke) is less accurate and less powerful than any other nerf guns I own (scout, maverick, nightfinder, rapidfire-20).  Also, this gun (either part) can't shoot any other type of ammo beside `streamline' darts (which can be used in other guns).  The scope is useless, as the darts don't even hit within it's view.  The detached single-shot blaster has more accuracy than the larger blaster, but is single fire and won't use other ammo, so it doesn't add much versatility unless someone is shooting your darts back at you. <br /> <br />If you want a toy sniper rifle, I would recommend an off-brand that uses spinning aerodynamic rubber rings.  Although these are also incompatible, and must be reloaded every time you fire, the one I bought (called a Tornado I think) was very accurate for and had a long range without wind. <br /> <br />For number of shots the Longshot offers, you'd be better off with a Maverick - which easier to reload than putting darts in a clip. <br /> <br />Maybe someday Nerf will make a sniper rifle that actually provides the user with range and accuracy.  Regardless, this gun looks awesome, and I'll probably use the base rifle for the convenience of the second clip, before I switch to a Maverick or a Scout as a backup.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|What an great movie and soundtrack!
B0006GAXKK|5.0|Note:  This is a re-issue until Rhino Records releases the Remastered Expanded version.<br /><br />In the spring of 1975, a producer named Robert Stigwood sent thousands of copies of a single with no artist's name on them, with a title called \\"Jive Talkin'\\". It was an immediate hit and people wanted more. Remember, that in 1967, Mr. Stigwood pulled this same stunt with \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\", teasing the public into thinking it was the Beatles trying to see if they could make it under a different band title. The resulting surprise was that it was the Bee Gees; that tear-jerking, ballad writing trio that had faded into an old record collection that millions of record buyers owned. \\"Jive Talkin'\\" went to #1. \\"Night On Broadway\\" followed with two versions - one with the slow bridge and one without. \\"Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)\\" was the third hit off the album. This latter one being a studio gem, but virtually UN-singable in public due to the intense over layered vocal work. Being a 'single' oriented group in the past, the Bee Gees had finally crafted an album worthy of all ten songs being memorable. \\"Wind Of Change\\" was actually the first demo sent to Stigwood, but became a concert staple instead with it's strong beat and funky rhythm. If you still longed for the old Bee Gees sound, \\"Songbird\\" fits the bill (no pun intended). It's as strong a love ballad as any they have had in the past. \\"Country Lanes\\" is nearly an anthem in it's perseverance of commitment to a lover. \\"Edge Of The Universe\\" and \\"All This Making Love\\" are, admittedly, novelty songs, but \\"Baby, As You Turn Away\\" is a grand finale. What better way to also compliment your latest album production than to have another artist (Olivia Newton-John) make a hit out of \\"Come On Over\\"? Given the times, the music and the variety, Main Course is no doubt one of the most important albums the Bee Gees have had in their roller coaster career.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|Really great copy to DVD, Loved it as a kid, and still love it....
0689815816|5.0|My son loves this book.  He always chooses this book for me to read to him.  The book repeats \\"Were going on a bear hunt, were going to catch a big one, it's a beautiful day, were not scared\\" several times throughout the book.  He likes the illlustrations.  He points to the dog and the kids throughout the book.  I like the book too.  You won't go wrong buying this book for your child.
1400079179|5.0|Dan Brown's book, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" can be viewed as a test to determine how receptive the readers mind is to new ideas. Be warned, some of the ideas presented in this story can be very uncomfortable for some people, depending on their religious convictions and on their receptivity. However, the material contained in his book is relevant on several levels.<br /><br /> First, the plot deals with a theme which is near the hearts of hundreds of millions of potential readers, namely the history of the Christian Church. The story challenges readers with new information which may not agree with what they think they already know.<br /><br /> Second, the book is exquisitely well researched, drawing from documents as old as the 1st century, through medievel Holy Grail legends, through Renaissance paintings, and ties them together into what the British used to call \\"a ripping yarn\\".<br /><br /> Third, although most of the characters in the book are fictional, many of the concepts presented in the story are historically true. It is perhaps this last point which has created the greatest amount of controversy.<br /><br /> The book develops the idea that before Christianity, many religions embraced a balanced worldview in which the sacred feminine principle and the sacred masculine principle joined to maintain harmony. That this was once the case is evident from the mythology of many cultures, with their pantheons of gods and goddesses. However, Brown writes that Jesus embraced these ideas as well, a notion which would have been radical to patriarchal Jews of that time, and would certainly have stepped on the toes of the Jewish clergy.<br /><br /> Brown does a good job of supporting this idea, and echoes what is documented in many other historical non-fiction works, such as \\"The Chalice And The Blade\\" by Riane Eisler.<br /><br /> Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the story for some readers to accept is that in addition to his revolutionary teachings, Jesus lived as did other Jewish men in his culture, and took a wife, Mary Magdelene, and had children with her, descendants of whom survive in the present day. Documents written in the first century comment on Jesus relationship with Mary, however these were eventually suppressed several hundred years later following the Nicean council. Interestingly, the four canonical gospels do not specifically deny that Jesus married, and are completely silent regarding his life between age 12 and age 30. Any given reader will accept or reject this premise of a married Jesus depending primarily on what they choose to accept as evidence.<br /><br /> Whether a reader believes that Jesus married or not, the premise does make a great \\"what if\\" foundation on which to construct a thrilling story, in a manner similar to \\"what if\\" the Ark of the Covenant were still in existence, and an archeologist found it? (i.e. Raiders of the Lost Ark). One does not need to actually believe that the Ark still exists, or even that it ever existed, in order to be entertained. Such is the case with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".<br /><br /> As was the case with films such as \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\", many (although certainly not all) Christians do not like to hear that what they already believe may not be completely accurate.<br />For some people, anything which might require a readjustment in thinking is automatically branded a falsehood. These are the people who picket movie theatres protesting films which they have never seen, or who write reviews slamming books which they have never read.<br /> In an ironic manner, these people become part of a  policy of suppression which attempts to block access to alternative information which presents a different view. As one who prefers to weigh both sides of issues and decide for myself what makes more sense, all the protests and denials made me want to read the book, and see to the film, even more.<br /><br /> Although difficult for some to admit, the reality is that sometimes new information becomes available which renders previous understandings obsolete. For example, we now know that diseases are caused by germs and virus, and not by an imbalance in \\"four humours\\", as was once believed. We now know that Earth is spherical, and orbits the Sun, instead of being flat and located at the center of the Universe, as widely believed by Christians for over 1000 years (the ancient pagans knew better, as proven by their surviving writings). Some of the information in this book will be \\"new information\\" to some people, others already were aware of the historical elements which form the basis for this story.<br /><br /> (spoiler alert!)\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" does not slander either the Catholic Church or Opus Dei, rather (spoiler alert!) the villian turns out to be one corrupt individual who arranges events to cause these two organizations to appear implicated in some of the goings-on.<br /><br /> I found the book to be sufficiently well written and interesting that I read it through in parts of three days. Nothing I read offended me, I read with an open mind and tended to think \\"Well, it COULD have happened that way\\". I've not yet seen the movie, but was aware that Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Ian McKellan were cast in leading roles, so I tended to see them in their roles as I read.<br /><br /> I enjoyed this book very much, and look forward to the movies release on DVD.obsolete.

B0006GAXI2|5.0|Note:  This is a re-issue until Rhino Records releases the Remastered Expanded version.<br /><br />This being the Bee Gees 2nd album, they distanced themselves a bit from the previous heavy orchestration and established themselves more of a rock/pop band. Featuring the #1 UK hit \\"Massachusetts\\" and the loud, rocking \\"World\\" (UK only), this set contains everything from plaintive sad ballads to rock and roll standards. Robin's \\"And The Sun Will Shine\\" is a classic tear-jerker and reputably, recorded on the first take. \\"Lemons Never Forget\\", \\"The Earnest Of Being George\\" and \\"The Change Is Made\\" are fine examples of late sixties rock and roll. The Beatles influenced is heard on \\"Birdie Told Me\\", a bouncy McCartney-esque tune and \\"Day Time Girl\\" also falls into this category. \\"Really And Sincerely\\" is a tad too melancholy and \\"Harry Braff\\" is simply annoying. However, the album succeeds in the end and finishes with \\"Horizontal\\", a brilliantly simple song with the piano chords reading - literally - horizontally.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|That's exactly what I was thinking while watching V for Vendetta.  The hero is, yes, a terrorist - a well read, articulate terrorist who loves music and old movies and has plans to change London by blowing a good deal of it to smithereens, unseating a fuhrer-esque dictator of a totalitarian regime full of shadowy underlings from power and, in turn, give the city back to its people, for, as V himself says, \\"People should not fear their governments, governments should fear the people,\\" or something to that effect.  V spends a good portion of the film donning his mask and debonair get-up as he dispatches one by one a group of people with dark ties to the masked avenger himself - think secret government-funded experiments, concentration camps, etc.  He reaches out to the people of London by highjacking the television airwaves to deliver his message of revolt.  He rescues and befriends a cute-as-a-button Natalie Portman.  He blows some stuff up.  And, one year later, he plans on destroying Parliament.  Talk about a revolution indeed.    As action films go this one certainly has a bit of brains and is, by far, better than most.  Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore who has universally hated all of the big screen adaptions of his work and subsequently had his name removed from this film, but nevertheless accepted the check, I'm sure, and cashed it hastily.  The Maxtrix team wrote it - the  Wachowski Brothers - and it is directed with style and flare by James McTeigue.  Good show!  Did I mention how cute Natalie Portman is?    This movie might not have been made a few years ago.  That was another thing that kept crossing my mind while watching V for Vendetta.  I'm not quite sure what the message of the film is, if any.  Can terrorism be justified?  Interesting.  Check out the movie - it's pretty good by the way - and chew on that one for a while.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Well I didn't go watch this movie on the big screen since I had heard the rumors on how big of a POS it was...and for once the rumors were 100% right. This movies is nothing but an anti-U.S., pro-terrorist, pro-anarchy, pro-gay mound of junk. I wouldn't have been surprised in the slightest if Bill Clinton was credited as an executive producer and Michael Moore as director at the end. Kudos to the aurthor of the graphic novel for dismissing this movie and publicly saying it in no way repersented his book. If you hate the U.S., love terrorism, see a consipiracy around every corner, and are a general left-wing nut...then this is your movie hands down. However if you're even 1/100th of a decent human being, save your money and buy a movie that is worth watching. If you're looking for a good movie based on a graphic novel without all the preachy politcal propaganda check out Sin City.
B000005RU2|5.0|Why, you might ask, is a lover of Jamaican reggae and ska, and of 70s Black American music, writing a review of a heavy metal band?     Well firstly because I love music of all types, and secondly, quite simply because this is the best live recording of any genre that money can buy!     It is THE definitive live album bar none, and one that every serious lover of music must have in their collection. It documents one of those once-in-a-lifetime occasions when a group of people come together (and here I must include the recording engineer and the audience) and produce something really special. This is metal's finest moment and one Deep Purple or indeed any other hard rock/metal band have never managed to equal, let alone surpass.    Here is an album that somehow manages to capture what most live recordings don't. It hasn't been fiddled with later in the studio so play it loud through a set of headphones and you are there. Sure, everything may be louder than everthing else but that does not mean that any one instrument drowns out any other. The recording engineer did a fantastic job in this respect - truly amazing given its thirty-four year vintage.     As for the content, yeah, some of the solos went on a bit by today's standards, but then the likes of Blackmore and Paice (who incidentally as a drummer I rate just marginally behind the truly great and highly creative Ginger Baker) were so damn good as musicians that they had every right to be a bit self-indulgent. That said, I think Ian Paice could have demonstrated his prowess on the drums in two minutes rather than six or seven. Space Truckin' also goes on way too long and the quality of recording is not as good as the other tracks. But I quibble.    These were real musicians playing real musical instruments before a live audience, nothing else, - surely what rock music was supposed to be all about! Gillan gets the vocal balance just right, Lord is the only person in the history of rock music that can get one of those god-awful '70s organs to sound anywhere decent, while Glover drives the whole thing along with a good thumping bass. These guys played so well that you have to keep reminding yourself that this is a live album. That's the difference between truly professional musicians and all the other the second-raters. Listen to Blackmore about five and a half minutes into \\"Child in Time\\" and you'll see what I mean. I don't care what genre it is, to hear someone play any instrument as well as this before a live audience is quite simply awe-inspiring!    The second CD in the remastered set is a bit of a waste of space however. The tracks are fine as pieces of musicianship go, but the sound quality is very poor and no amount of remastering can make them better. Still, as it's a bonus it shouldn't detract from the overall rating. They must have been the tracks rejected the first time around.    So there you have it. If you are a next generation metalhead and haven't heard this, I suggest that you fork over the few bucks and invest in a bit of metal history. Bands like this are where it all started. Play it a few times, compare it to today, and then like me you'll probably wonder where it all went wrong!
1592401791|5.0|Geoff Emerick's personal memories of the Beatles recording sessions, stands as one of the truest precious insights in the private world of the world's most written about  band. This is the real thing...presented by this most down-to-earth. unaffected individual. Real first hand accounts, (the rarest commodity because most Beatles books are written by people who really weren't personally involved). Read this book and you'll begin to relearn things about their everyday activities, and lots more. For example, you'll find out a lot more about the realities of recording Sgt. Peppers, The Double White, Abbey Road...Far more than even John Lewisham's accounts and diaries. You'll read about the real George Martin. and his school master manner. Plus you'll really feel it when Geoff Emerick discribes the bands' demise. As if you were there with them... <br />Fantastic reading, plus great value!
B000002ILG|5.0|I love this cd! It really has everything included of what makes up a great cd, catchy chorus, great riffs, awesome vocals. I greatly recommend all rockers out there getting this it is definetly worth it, my favorite song on this disc is 'Lady Of The Valley'. I like just about every song on here, I think there are 2 songs on the whole thing that I dont care for. But the buttom line is that this really is a great cd.
B000002UZ6|5.0|Actually I bought this for two songs, but the whole cd rocks.  It is a must have for any collection!
1594200823|5.0|This is an extraordinary book. Michael Pollan comprehensively goes back to the farm roots of various meals - starting from McDonalds to a personal hunting and foraging trip. The most interesting items are the discussion of large agribusiness - both the non organic and the organic versions. There are a lot of surprises in your food out there.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Like other reviewers, I bought this mainly for \\"Crazy\\".  I also agree that this album is not for everyone.  Don't expect every song to be fun and bouncy - \\"Just a Thought\\" is about suicide, and \\"Necromancing\\" is about necrophilia.  I think that these songs don't really fit in with the rest of the album, and that's why I give St. Elsewhere four stars.  Yes, the album is short, but I would rather have it be short than have a longer album where I don't like half of the songs.  I like 12 of the 14 songs on this album, and I consider that to be better than most albums out there.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|After thoroughly enjoying the DVD/CD release, \\"Caught in the Act,\\" I also gave this CD a listen to by Buble, the second album of his that I have listened to. I have to give it 5 stars because I am very much impressed with and enamoured by Buble's emergence on the scene. He is a very capable vocalist and has given me a new perspective on what a jazz vocalist should sound like.     In comparing this album to \\"Caught in the Act,\\" I would say that \\"Caught in the Act\\" is a better purchase. A lot of the songs on here are the same arrangements used on \\"Caught in the Act,\\" except these are the studio takes. I still think this is a great album, but being able to see Buble on the DVD was what made me get into his music. This album is a nice follow-up to \\"Caught in the Act,\\" and proves once again, that Buble is a great vocalist.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|Good Recording (both picture and sound) <br />It's the last best performance of Bee Gees. <br />Strong recommend for anyone who loves Bee Gees.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|Having heard the real Travis talk about his abduction I was anxious to see the video interpretation of the experience. Expecting a low-budget \\"B\\" movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie took the premise seriously, focusing on the reactions of Travis' friends instead of lingering on outrageous special effects. I highly reccommend this film.
B000063JZQ|2.0|I had to force myself to give this two stars instead of one because, to be fair, there IS a great cast, meaningful scenes, and gorgeous cinematography. However, there were many unnecessary things that turned me off this movie.<br /><br />Let me confirm that I am an avid fan of Shakespeare and love many of his plays as well as many of the movies that are based on them. In this one, however, I rather felt that Polanski took the play and ran wild with it. Yes, Macbeth is disturbing and depressing, so the fact that these elements turned my stomach may be considered by some as a success on the movie's part, but there are plenty of other things the play didn't include that the movie had unnecessarily. For example, the nudity. I'm no prude, but there was plenty of unnecessary and uncomfortable nakedness in this film and the majority of it seemed to add to the idea of the characters taking advantage of each other (maybe this was the intention, but I doubt it). The scene with Lady Macbeth wandering naked and mad around her room wouldn't have bothered me if a male \\"doctor\\" hadn't been standing there oogling at her. I wanted to smack him, as well as Lady Macbeth's maidservant, who stood there letting her mistress walk around naked in front of a man; how many of the notoriously prudish and protective lady's maids back then would have allowed such a thing? The inaccuracy of this scene made me think it was really just an attempt to prove that Lady Macbeth was just as attractive without her clothes on. What really disgusted me, though, was the scene showing a woman bathing her eleven-year-old son. He wasn't sitting in a tub, either, but standing and baring all from all angles in front of the camera. Gee thanks; a mother's intrusive treatment of her kid wasn't supposed to be the topic of the film, but who remembers these things? The kid's nudity perse didn't bother me, but considering his age, there was no need for a woman to be washing him like an infant and the scene had a very invasive feel to me. For the record, I don't have any problem with the naked witches. Unlike the people in the aforementioned nude scenes, the witches were fully grown, mentally sound and willing to be sky-clad, so I didn't feel like they were being disrespected or taken advantage of in any way.<br /><br />On another note, some of the violence was a little too much, too; I did not need to see the perspective from the eyes of a decapitated head or a man getting a sword in the groin. The movie altogether gave me a feeling of dirty depression. Shakespeare may have been partly to blame for this, but it was definitely Polanski's additions to the story that decided me against a second viewing. This would have succeeded as a moving film without a great deal of the additional nastiness that it contained; substituting gratitious shock-value junk for quality always fails. Next time, try relying a little more on the pathos of the story. And please, let's keep parents out of the room when their big kids are taking baths, shall we?feel to me.

B000A2H812|5.0|I bought this album based on their appearance of visual frenzy when they played a late show a while ago.  I couldn't hear the sound because I was at a bar--but their music will kick you in the nuts and make you like it. <br /> <br />
B000GIXEIG|5.0|This was a very good movie. Beautifully shot, beautifully scripted, and beautifully performed, but does not follow the true story of Beowulf and Grendel. <br />Having read the actual Beowulf in high school I was pretty psyched to see this new adaption of the classic story, but did get a disapointment when it did not follow the story. BUT I did still get a huge enjoyment out of this movie. It had many, many similarities to the original story and had pretty much the same storyline, it just had  some additional characters and the death of Grendel was different in the film. I do think a little more could have been explained in the movie, like the Sea Hag (Grendel's mother). If I had not read the original Beowulf, I would have had no idea who she was or why she was so upset over Grendel's death. I also didn't see the point in adding the character of Selma to the film. Her only purpose was to have a sex scene in the film. But I did think it was cool how they made Grendel have a son and have the same situation occur with Beowulf and Grendel's son as it happened with Hrothgar and Grendel. A very interesting, entertaining, and funny new outlook to this classic story. Excellent performances by Gerard Butler (as Beowulf), Stellan Skarsgsrd (as King Hrothger), and Invar Eggert Sigurosson (as Grendel). Also, some extremely beautiful shots of Iceland. Highly Recommended!
068987474X|5.0|This book is totally worth reading.  I read it as I was entering into a new relationship.  To see the warning signs.  I HAD to get it after seeing Greg on Oprah.  Anyway, I saw so many examples of things my exes had done to me.  Not only does he talk about bad things, he also explains how in certain situations a NICE guy would act.  Lucky me, the only examples I could find of my current man were in the nice guy section.  Now we are married with a baby girl!
B00003CXPD|5.0|It's been a long time since I've seen a movie as complex and subtle as this one.  The actors are very good at portraying emotions through body language as opposed to vocalizing them.  The characters are three dimensional, and it's interesting that the viewer misjudges them the same way that they misjugde Billy.  I loved this movie.
B000007OTH|3.0|Max Bruch's symphonies are not well known, but will be of interest to those who love his music. They are workmanlike, beautiful essays, without quite reaching heights of greatness (although with Kurt Masur's superb conducting, one is inclined to have second thoughts at times). When the symphonies in this collection give way to works for violin and orchestra, it is easy to understand why Max Bruch is best remembered for this form. This album includes the heart-rending \\"In Memoriam\\" for violin and orchestra - one of Bruch's very finest achievements, even though it remains obscure.

0307263118|5.0|I lived by the sea most of my life. For that reason I could never quite truly relate myself to those longings that you hear about from friends or relatives that have travelled somewhere on the coast and were now full of impressions and marveled at the beauties of coastline. There are, in my town as well, people who live from the sea and will eventually die of it, sunken in some kind of freak accident or simply be too old to put up any kind of challenge to the water element. Yet, even being as it is, I always could relate to those stories of rememberance lost in some small hotel, where staff didn't exist and you could find only one sad and lonely lady and one or two «regular customers» who were as lonely as she was. It is the story of hotels that have seen better days, basically it is the story of better days. Days when we were younger and more agile, when thing didn't frighten us as much as they do today. It is the story of a life that we once led and that life has now departed.<br /><br /> I read much. Much more than it's good for my health, or my sanity. But every so often (not so often that it would spoil the whole thing) I stumble upon book that is pure enjoyment. You know those kind of books for which you are glad that exist, that in some way are the reason that we ventured upon this solitary road of readin, refusing to be a part of modern civilisation with its tons of informations that are quickly forgotten.<br /><br /> If we are to find enjoyment in everything that we do, be it of aesthetic kind or purely sensual one, we must long to know, to find ourselves within boundaries of imaginary world. Language here being the only border that we must cross. Longing of that kind should be that stuff that dreams are made of, that thing that drives the world forward and keeping it from falling apart.<br /><br /> Forgive me here  for not stating the plot, or what happens in the book, or anything abaout the characters in it. I think of the impression as the much more important thing. After all, you can find those kind of information everywhere, but this kind of authentic rambling is just that, authentic <br /><br /> So, in light of what has been said, I could not but recommend the book that brought traces of joy together with sadness, hints of past and hints of future.

B000E97HIA|5.0|I have been a fan since the first solo album \\"For You\\" (1979 or 1980) and the single \\"Soft and Wet\\".  His music is the soundtrack of my life!  As for 3121, the title track is a headbanger.  He is a funkmaster (and I am a funk listener). His bass line drives your very soul and makes you thump for moments after the track is over.  He is a gifted lead guitarist. \\"Nothing can compare to him\\"... This album should be played at BBQ's, funky sweaty parties, make-out sessions, chillin' with friends and when you need to get some \\"serious\\" work done. <br /> <br />Highly recommended listening
0895260131|5.0|I bought this book because of the negative reviews. Yes the glowing positive references are fine, but it was the negative reviews that clinched it for me. Why do some people have such negative responses to this book that they want to rate it ZERO ? <br /> <br />Maybe because there is a discussion they want to suppress ? <br /> <br />The more you read around this subject the more you think of L. Ron Hubbard and his creation of a cult to serve his own personal objectives, and, well the thought crosses my mind when I think of a businessman out in The Hejaz picking up stories from passing caravans of Biblical and Zoroastrian religions and thinks it a good idea to make his own with himself at its centre. <br /> <br />There is also a very interesting book by Rev Menenzes dated 1912 - Life of Mohammed - I think which is more historical whereas this book links to the contemporary. <br /> <br />Now to those reviews. If they cannot debate or discuss we are dealing with the blind obedience of The Cult and from what I see there is so much divinity attributed to Mohammed by Muslims that one would think they have tried to manufacture their own \\"Christ\\". There are some very peculiar theological underpinnings to Islam which do not withstand close inspection which is probably why the negative reviewers favour blind acceptance over inquiring minds.  Not a bad book at all............but let the negative reviews persuade you - it is well-worth reading !
B00000260F|1.0|I'm a big JB fan and this is terrible. It isn't even a good album without mentioning JB. Directionless over-produced and horrible even though my all time favourite producer Nile Rodgers produced it. <br /> <br />The problem is that the material is rubbish, JB has never been recognised as a great writer, he's a guitar man.  Next time Jeff hire some good writers.
B0000640SA|5.0|Directed by Christopher Nolan, \\"Memento\\" is a Masterpiece of suspense. I highly recommend this film to all viewers. As the films narrative begins, we find the films main protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) as a man who suffers from a rare brain disorder caused by trauma. Leonard is unable to remember recent events that occur, and as a result, he must write down everything. Even going so far as to have tattoos on his body to remember the most important evidence which will help him find the man who killed his wife. Furthermore, he even takes photos of people to help him remember who they are. However, there is more to Leonard than we are led to believe, and I do not wish to divulge this information. Leonard has begun his search of the killer by relying on the tattoos on his body, and photographs that he keeps in his pocket--for if he does not, then 10 minutes later he will forget everything.<br /><br />Furthermore, even though Leonard is suffering from a loss of memory, and unable to remember events that occur, he is tormented by the death of his wife--and is relentless in his pursuit of the killer. He was a former insurance agent who one night was attacked in his home. With his wife murdered, while he was left for dead, the injuries caused are rare brain disorder which has left him frustrated in trying to uncover the truth. Moving along with the narrative, we see Leonard as an insurance investigator prior to his attack. He was responsible for uncovering fraudulent claims. And interspersed within the films narrative of Leonard's memory loss, we see him as a man who has denied the same claim by a man named Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky). He denied the claim on the justification that the man was faking his illness in order to collect money. And Sammy's story is important to the film.<br /><br />Leonard's attempts in trying to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife is difficult. The problem is not only that Leonard has short-term memory loss due to a blow to his head when his wife was attacked, but moreover, who can he trust? Enter another protagonist in this film, Teddy Gammell (Joe Pantoliano). Can Leonard trust him? And what does Teddy know about Leonard that he is not telling him? The interesting part of this film is that it begins at the end and then proceeds backwards in reverse chronological order. Teddy's character is very important in the film, and where Teddy's loyalties are, leave the viewer in suspense. The entire film is a Masterpiece in script-writing, and it is thoroughly worth the watch. I highly recommend this film to all viewers.

B000FVQYZY|5.0|My two favs are \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" and \\"Knights of Cydonia\\".  However, the entire CD is GREAT!  \\"Take A Bow\\" is another fav, with timely lyrics, amazing vocals and  instrumentation.  I enjoyed the intimacy of  \\"Soldier's Poem\\" which is riveting with its softly poignant message (although it sounds like a home produced demo using an RX-11 drum machine).  I own every Muse CD and although I noticed some departure from their usual fare on a few of the treatments on this CD, the overall production is totally MUSE!  The strong lyrical content, consistently effective vocals, the amazing keyboards and technically superb guitar and bass lines are the reasons I pop in the CD and listen, from \\"Take A Bow\\" to \\"Knights,\\" without interruption!

B000003TAR|5.0|Actually, the title of my review doesn't truly represent my opinion of this album. For me, this is the holy grail of all albums. Am I surprised that Nirvana would end up writing my all-time favourite album ever? Not at all. After hearing \\"Nevermind\\", it was clear that Cobain and the rest of the group had a true talent for writing music. However, the one thing that did surprise me was that the album that would leave such an impression on me would sound like this.  <br /> <br />For those who have heard Nevermind (who hasn't?), one could define it basically as poppy grunge. Sure, the songs were pretty rockin' (most of them), but they all had some sort of catchy hook or some lines that you just couldn't resist singing along too. As it turned out, the person who seemed to realise this more than anyone was Kurt Cobain himself, and so for the album that would become In Utero, he intentionally wrote anti-mainstream songs. What amazes me is that an album that was intended to be, in some way or another, \\"bad\\" (at least in radio terms) could end up being so good. What Cobain did, at least from what I can hear, is write songs that were good in a different way. As it turned out, this way was the best kind of way.  <br /> <br />There are several albums I own where every song is good. However, of those songs, there are usually only a select few that are fantastic the first time I hear it, and remain fantastic each time I hear it afterwards. In the case of \\"In Utero\\", each and every song on here is amazing. If one were to ask me my favourite, I wouldn't be able to answer right away, as I would have to consider every single track before I could really say (To this day, 12 years after I bought it, I still don't truly have a favourite song of this album).  <br /> <br />There is no denying that these songs are fueled by Cobain's deep, and powerful lyrics. Although these songs can be impressive musically (the simple yet effective guitar riffs, Grohl's always fabulous drumming, the celloon a couple of the songs, etc.), the lyrics always end up stealing the spotlight. When I hear Cobain sing \\"Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back\\" on Heart Shaped Box, or when he screams \\"Your scent is still here in my place of recovery\\" on Milk It, or his legendary chant of \\"All in all is all we are\\" on All Apologies, I to this day get chills.  <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, like I said, they are all worthy of recognition. Heart Shaped Box, if I had to choose, would probably be my favourite on here. With it's unbelievable lyrics and distorted masterpiece of a guitar solo, this remains to this day the best song I've ever heard. The non-sensical and barely understandable shrieks throughout the ingenious \\"Tourette's\\" make this one of coolest punk rock songs ever. Pennyroyal Tea, Rape Me, Dumb, Very Ape, Milk It, and All Apologies are more of the absoloutely brilliant songs you'll hear on this CD.  <br /> <br />Really, In Utero is more like an experience rather than an album. It is something that absoloutely MUST be listened to from front to back, as it would be a crime to skip ANY of these songs. However, with all the praise I've given this album, I must also remind the reader that this was an album that Cobain intentionally made sound harsher. There are NO songs on here that posess the catchy hooks along the lines of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" or \\"Lithium\\". There is alot more screaming on this album as well, so if you were only in to Nirvana's radio hits from Nevermind, I would strongly recommend against buying this. However, if your looking for something heavier, or if you simply like rock music, it is just WRONG for In Utero to not be in your collection. Before I end this, I must express my grief over the death of Kurt Cobain. After hearing this album, one truly understands why he is considered to be one of the greatest songwriters in recent times (the last great one, so far). It is painful to consider what could have been. However, under the circumstances, I really could not think of a better way to end the legend that was Nirvana. Go buy this album immediately, you won't regret it.

0452270073|4.0|I found \\"Regeneration\\" by Pat Barker to be a gruesomely truthful book as it describes the traumatic events soldiers endured during the First World War. It provides horrific details of men wounded and the affects of war on their mental state of mind as well as their physical states. Barker goes into detail describing the ways in which the doctors at Craiglockhart, a mental institution in Scotland where those suffering from shell shock and other post-war illnesses are sent to recuperate and prepare themselves to possibly re-enter war, must find any way possible to cure and convince patients that fighting in the war is proving how faithful one is to their country. Siegfried Sasson, a patient at Craiglockhart who previously was a soldier who composed poems based upon what he has witnessed throughout the war, is one of Barker's main characters. He has realized that the war has moved from being based upon freedom to proving which country is the most powerful and most dominating. Dr. Rivers, the protagonist, must evaluate and diagnose patients then find cures for whatever problems war has caused for them such as shell shock. He uses different types of therapy based on the state of the patient. Sasson and Rivers develop a close relationship and eventually when Sasson returns to fighting, Rivers realizes that Sasson has greatly affected his life and his view on issues such as war. \\"Regeneration\\" focuses mostly on the consequences of war rather than the actual war itself. Those who resulted in having shell shock were especially unfortunate and \\"Regeneration\\" describes the evaluation, cures, and aftermath of it.

B00002ND77|5.0|Director Spike Lee presents a courtroom epic,very much like Oliver Stone's JFK,about the assassination of Malcolm Little,a civil rights leader,commonly known as Malcolm X. Malcolm X of course,followed in the footsteps of another now-deceased civil rights leader,Dr. Martin Luther King. This film,like JFK,was distributed by Warner Bros. This film grossed about eight million dollars on December 18,1992,the day it was theatrically released. Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X. I'm sure Lee thought Washington was born to play the role. There's also Angela Bassett(WAITING TO EXHALE,WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?,WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE?) supporting Washington. Hey,The Cosby Show actor Malcolm Jamal Warner was named after Malcolm X also jazz pianist Ahmed Jamal. There should be epics about King and the late Anwar Sadat,who was once Egypt President(he was assassinated in 1981). But then again,there might already be an epic on the life and death of King.
0307276902|3.0|A Million Little Pieces is a MUST READ for folks such as Oprah enthusiasts who live for gushy sob stories, rivers of gushing tears and endless gushy hugs. And it's a pretty good read even if it's more of a novel that memoir. Besides after a few chapters it's pretty obvious that it's liberally seasoned with baloney. I don't mind, most of the bible is fantasy too yet some folks think it has value. James Frey deserves some credit for spinning a pretty good yarn, more credit for managing to sell it but mostly he deserves a gushy group hug for fooling Oprah.
0790729733|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen,citizens,it is with humble respect that director Oliver Stone presents the investigation of the death of a great American,John Fitzgerald Kennedy,the 35th President of the United States. It was Stone's hope and intention,that this courtroom epic,which runs for approximately three and a half hours,will become a living memory and an inspiration to both current and future generations. Kevin Costner is Jim Garrison,a district attorney who represents Lee Harvey Oswald who was accused of Kennedy's November 22,1963 assassination in Dallas. Sissy Spacek is Jim's wife. This film also features special appearances by Kevin Bacon and the late John Candy. Unlike Kennedy,then-Texas governor(now deceased) John B. Connolly survived the shooting although he was wounded. I dedicate this film to the memory of Kennedy and the surviving members of his family. Stone should make epics about the lives and post-presidency deaths of Lyndon B. Johnson,Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. I'm sure Nixon and Reagan saw this film(they were both alive in 1991 when this film was theatrically released). I'm also sure that Gerald Ford,Jimmy Carter,Bill Clinton,George W. Bush and Bush's father saw this film also.
B00005NB8K|1.0|...and much more Oliver Stone's vision of what the Doors' music and Jim's life was, truth be damned.  Supposedly, Stone was inspired by the book No One Here Gets Out Alive (written by Jerry Hopkins in 1973-74, but not published until 1980 when Danny Sugerman, Jim's one-time teenage factotum, did some judicious rewriting), but very little of the book, even, is present in this film.  I had to see it three times just to believe what I was seeing--in short, an absolute hatchet job on Jim Morrison, and nothing like the real Jim at all.<br /><br />I honestly have no idea where the scene with Jim locking Pam in a burning closet came from; nowhere in the Doors' history does this incident appear.  Jim did not meet Patricia Kennealy in 1967 (Kennealy herself has verified this in her book, Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison) at a press conference; their first meeting was a private interview in New York City in January 1969.  And she was not the girl who was with him backstage in New Haven when he was famously maced by a cop, then told that story onstage and was promptly arrested for doing so.  Jim was not the sadistic, unfeeling creature portrayed in the film--you honestly don't feel sorry for him when he dies at the end--and even the infamous \\"Miami Incident\\" is misportrayed.  He did not offer to show off his penis to the audience, and although he did attempt to do so, he was forcibly restrained from it by one of the band's roadies.  And Pam was not with him during the trial, which stretched out over many months between 1969 and 1970; Jim never said of his handfasting to Kennealy that \\"I was stoned, it seemed like a fun thing to do at the time.\\"  He was very serious about his vows to her (and no, she is not paying me to say any of this.  I've read her book and I've read some of the other books, and I think I'm able to judge what's truth and what's clearly fabrication).<br /><br />Also, we'd do well to remember that Stone was off in Vietnam while much of this was going on--his own idea, and given a fictitious-yet-autobiographical treatment in Platoon--and just apart from that, he tends toward sweeping overstatement.  This film is just a mess; don't waste your time or money.his was going on--his own idea, and given a fictitious-yet-autobiographical treatment in Platoon--and just apart from that, he tends toward sweeping overstatement.

0790729644|5.0|A great movie does not follow a formula but crafts a story that tells you something.  Eastwood has done something magnificent here and in the process he's explained what's going on in many inferior Westerns.  There are violent people in the world that handle situations differently than most, but this film is more about clarity of conviction than violence... if you are going to do something, you might as well commit yourself to it.   <br /> <br />Unforgiven is a great movie and a compelling story.  Peckinpah was one of the first to successfully film violent men.  Cormac McCarthy and Hemingway successfully wrote about them. Pick up McCarthy's \\"No Country For Old Men\\" to see his take.
0451191153|5.0|I wonder how Roark would review \\"The Fountainhead\\". Hmm... <br /> <br />Let me start by saying you've made a mistake already, Peter, by asking what I think of this book. You can read. You can think. You're still human and you're still capable of reason. You know enough to make a judgement. <br /> <br />The setting is the world of architecture. The theme is the importance of integrity. If the title, setting, or theme intrigue you read the novel. <br /> <br />What I think of the Fountainhead matters to only one person: myself. I will not provide you with a pre-digested approval or disapproval of this book. I will, however, offer you advice on how to understand it. Advice that applies to any other book you might read in the future as well. <br /> <br />When an author publishes a novel, they publish only a slim fraction of the thought that went into that product. Art is a process of selectivity; for every word in a novel, there are a thousand words written and struck out again.  <br /> <br />When an Ayn Rand offers you \\"The Fountainhead\\", she is laying before you, for a price of a few dollars, years of her life and enormous mental effort. Understanding the novel to the root requires that you put in the mental effort to follow- a tiny fraction when compared the mental effort that went into the creation. Your mental effort is multiplied by the originator-but the degree of your understanding is your OWN achievement, and your final assessment is your own \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" in answer to the author's song. <br /> <br />An Einstein may give you E=MC2. That will be of no benefit if you accept it passively. But if you seek to understand, the road from ignorance to knowledge is a glorious road- even if the knowledge is ultimately rejected in favor of something else that you find more convincing. <br /> <br />Ayn Rand has placed in your path either a rock or a gem. Pick it up and value it according to that which you determine it to be. Don't judge it based on what others say. Hold it in your hand and really look. <br /> <br />A novel I read is something I judge against my own lifetime of knowledge. The connections I make between it and my own observations are unique and unrepeatable. <br /> <br />A novel is just like a love affair, a college course, a career, or a cause- you get out of it what you put in.  <br /> <br />So don't look to me to review it. That defeats the very purpose of Art. If you love it, you will have gained a value in this life. We may find we have a value in common. If you hate the novel, it will not affect my opinion in the slightest. <br /> <br />Nor will it affect Ayn Rand or the value of her acheivement. <br /> <br />Oh-- <br />And please take my blueprints out of your pants before you go...

0141439831|3.0|VANITY FAIR is a sprawling epic novel that tells of the struggle of nearly everyone in it either to gain money or to bemoan the not having of it.  This relentless groping toward money is not a trait normally associated with heroism, yet the subtitle suggests Thackeray's connection between the two: A Novel Without a Hero.  This does not imply that the novel ambles along interminably with the central figure or figures merely deficient in the manly arts of dash and verve.  Rather, for the protagonist to be heroic, such a person must exhibit the willingness to be so.  In VANITY FAIR, Thackeray maintains a circumspect distance between character and reader by imposing an obstacle, namely himself, as that obstacle.   <br /> <br />Thackeray sets up the reader to view his creations as un-heroic in two ways. First, he paints them as essentially flat.  Amelia, in her passive attitude toward life is the polar opposite of Becky Sharp, who is bursting with energy and passion. Together, they alternate respectively from purposeful villainy to willing victim, from street smarts to pathetic naivety, and from patent guile to equally patent guilelessness. As one acts on her respective traits, she rises in the world in a financial sense while as the other acts on her traits, she falls. Later, they alternate roles, and the novel turns into a push-pull context with their changes in position occurring solely as a function of their acting on those impulses. In Amelia's case, these impulses are passive-aggressive.  In Becky's, they are purely aggressive. But in neither case, is either heroic. <br /> <br />Thackeray regularly intrudes in the narrative so that he directs the responses and attitudes of the readers. The more he plays the omniscient narrator, the less convincing is the fleshing out of any character.  It then becomes quite difficult for the reader to look past the puppeteer's strings to see that character in any terms except the flatness that Thackeray wishes.  The best that one can say about Amelia is that she creates dramatic conditions that call for the real dramatic center: Becky Sharp.  This is not to say that Becky is the hero in the morally positive sense. But she is the focal point of bursting enthusiasm. As she throws a dictionary out the window in a fit of petulant rage, Becky impacts on the reader in a way that no one else can.  Becky spends the rest of the novel throwing metaphorical books out countless windows as she schemes, flirts, and uses men shamelessly, all the while escaping criticism from a morally neutral author.  One does not admire Amelia for her passivity nor Becky for her aggressiveness. One tends to ignore the former and notice the latter.  Long before the reader comes to the morally ambiguous ending when Thackeray bemoans: \\"Ah! Vanitas Vanitatum! Which of us is happy in this world?\\" the reader has learned that the totality of VANITY FAIR's strong points--and there are many--do not compensate for the moral vacuum that the author leaves at the center where there ought to be someone or something more interesting
B0002TX4QQ|5.0|This was one of the most unique books I have ever read. It is the story of a young teenage boy named Kevin who has killed several of his classmates in a horrific manner. The book is written as a series of letters from his mother to his father. It recounts the early relationship of his parents, through pregnancy and birth. It tells of his infancy and childhood. Throughout you see glimpses of the horror to come. You find yourself asking, \\"How did this happen?\\" You question if Kevin (and likewise any violent person) was born this way or was he a product of the various environmental factors in his life?<br /><br />I also found myself wondering as I read the book about the father to whom the letters are addressed. Where is he? Why is he apparently not involved in his son's life? What happened to the family unit (which appears intact early on)? And since you do not discover exactly what Kevin has done until the very end, you find yourself becoming more and more curious about what really happened. All in all, I found myself reading this book faster and faster as I went along because I was formulating so many questions in my mind that I wanted the answers to. Let me assure you (without giving away the ending) that all of my questions were answered...<br /><br />This book is not an easy read. The language the author uses is different from the average novel we are used to reading, but I found it intriguing. Also the subject matter is not a pleasant one. Violence, much less violent children, is a hard subject to dwell on. However, I found this book riveting. And it is a wonderful discussion starter.<br /><br />Anyone who works with children should absolutely read this book. And if you work with children who are emotionally disturbed, this is a MUST READ. Also, anyone who is looking for a thought-provoking, discussion-stimulating, eye-opening read should take the time to read this one.
B000002MZ6|4.0|Mike Oldfield as an artist is one of the few who can give what we probably can call a somekind of an \\"out of body experience\\" im music. This Cd is a good example of it. The only minus experience,as sometimes with Mike Oldfield is that there are to little creativity and variations as he sometimes spins around the same theme over and over again. Anyway he kicks your soul in gear with Track 1 In the beginning, which opens with some kind of \\"new age\\" atmosphere, and gives you on the rest some quivering soul pleasures that word hardly can describe.Track 2 Let there be light follows in much of the same direction, but here Oldfields guitar realy sets the standard as we knows it with a \\"sc-fi outer space sound\\" which makes the Oldfield soundpicture kind of  unique. Track 3 Supernova, sounds hot and the sound melts into youre ear with a vibrating feel. Track 4 Magellan is one of the weak \\"spot\\"s on the album. Too much too soon in the beginning, kills much of the listening experience. Not the place for bagpipes sound. Track 5 First landing is a short one, with some lively playing on the synth, but thats it.<br /><br />Track 6 Oceania makes you feel that  your`e soul is kicked out in the oceania, and you are far far away from land, but it doesn`t matter. The soul pleasure is realy there. Track 7 Only time will tell is more rythmic in it`s atmosphere, and have much of the same atmosphere as the previous one, nothing more to add realy.<br /><br />Track 8 Prayer for the earth has an etnic lapp song in the background, (a monotone chant in the background with strong rythm,) Weird and wonderful is probably the right phrase. Track 9 Lament for Atlantis has a certain\\"quiet is the new loud atmosphere\\" all trough. Track 10 The Chamber has a mumbling fuzzy singing which i don`t get, but the overall atmosphere is quite ok.  Track 11 Hibernaculum has much of the same atmosphere, but the vocal is clean and gives you more pleasure deep down. Track 12 Tubular World, is the one that shorts you right up info the space with a slight \\"ecco\\" an inspiration from the Tubular bells classic, but not so creepy. Track 13 The shining ones is a weird synth \\"dippie dutt\\" which fall flat after a time. You get eartired in away listen to it . Track 14 Crystal clear is a simpel ok tune. It has a certain clearness, but i dont like thai fuzzy guitar, but when the vocal says : crystal clear it helps. Track 15 The sunken Forest, brings you down \\"under the water\\", and you can feel it allover the body. Track 16 Ascension is typical Oldfield, With a clear guitar without any fuzz. Great.

B000002UVX|5.0|That - the title of this review - is what it said on the spine and green Capitol label of the very first copy (and first Henrix album) I ever bought, which was originally released in April 1970 - eighteen long months after the Jimi Hendrix Experience's third and final studio album, \\"Electric Ladyland.\\" The group was already fracturing by then, though the soldiered on in the studio and on tour through a final US date June 30, 1969, after which a frustrated Noel Redding split for England and Fat Mattress (Reprise collected eight of the group's best known tracks, added four unreleased in the US, and a \\"giant poster\\" for \\"Smash Hits\\" that July). Many factors and motivations - financial, political, cultural, personal, musical - likely led to the short lived Band Of Gypsys. Jimi had already produced a Buddy Miles solo album and worked with the drummer (noteably on part of \\"Ladyland\\"). Billy Cox was an old Army buddy, fine bassist, with no ambitions to write songs - he patiently worked with Hendrix for over a year during 1969 - 70 as the guitarist developed new songs and opened his dream studio, almost until the end (Cox split after being dosed with PCP at one of Hendrix's final Euro dates). And, perhaps symbolically if not intentionally, BOG was an all black band.  1970 was a year in which live albums were in vogue, and recording technology had progressed sufficiently since the mid-60s (recall the Brit Invasion hysteria that dominates \\"Live Kinks\\" or the Stones' \\"Got Live\\") to make a good live album a desired addition to any important artist's body of work. Reprise issued another live Hendrix set (the Montery Pop album, with one side devoted to Otis Redding) four months after BOG, as Jimi was still finishing up his next - posthumous  - studio album, and it had become evident that the studio project was unlikely to be issued before 1971 (even had Hendrix lived). And in 1970 classic live sets came out by the Stones, Who, Cream, Doors, Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, and others.What was different about \\"Band Of Gypsys\\" was that it contained all new material. Buddy Miles possessed none of Mitch Mitchell's inventive, jazz-influenced chops that interacted so perfectly with Hendrix, but he was a solid, funky, visually arresting timekeeper who during the period was pretty famous himself thanks to his tenure with the Electric Flag, and would record fine albums with John McLaughlin and Santana as well as several successful solo sets. BOG was thus also, almost, a supergroup, to use the jargon of the times. If not as essential as the three studio Experience albums, or \\"Cry Of Love\\"/\\"First Rays\\", Hendrix was hardly marking time here, expanding his songwriting style as well as his sonic arsenal on the classics \\"Machine Gun\\" and \\"Who Knows.\\"  The original album sounded a bit drab, and if the Capitol (1995) cd was an improvement in clarity - not warmth or presence - the more recent Experience Hendrix version is the best we're likely to get on compact disc. But I'm reviewing this to recommend spending a few extra bucks on the numbered limited edition issued by Classic Records after the most recent CD. This gorgeous piece is well worth tracking down. Mastered using all analog transfer equipment from the actual masters by Eddie Kramer and George Marino (their initials etched in the black inner groove of the disc). For Hendrix fans, I promise - it blows the cd and the original vinyl out of the water. Sonically a rather grey recording is now an exciting listening experience: warm, detailed, alive, with an increase in image depth and definition, it actually lives up to the cliche \\"like hearing it for the first time.\\" And the physical thing itself is a beauty - the heavy cardboard stock used on the cover is thicker and like the disc heavier than the first edition original - to which it is faithful but much superior. (By the way, Classic also issued \\"Axis\\" in its rare mono mix, which is not better than the stereo version but an interesting contrast for fanatics).  Lots more funk-influenced, and to over simplify 'social conciousness' lyrics generally supplant both the \\"Foxy Lady\\" come ons and the spiritual and cosmic preoccupations of \\"Ladyland,\\" it's fascinating to hear Hendrix emphasisizing wah-wah funk and singing to women about asserting themselves indepenent of any man. Only on the finale, \\"We Got To Live Together\\" is this set anything less than terrific, and side one of course is even better than that.   By the time this album was originally issued, the Band Of Gypsys had dissolved. Hendrix brought Mitch Mitchell back, and kept Cox on, for the next round of tours and recording sessions.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote<br /><br />(Sony Classics)<br /><br />Directed by: Bennett Miller<br /><br />Cast: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins, Chris Cooper<br /><br />In 1959, Dwight Eisenhower was President of the United States, Fidel Castro methodically seized power in Cuba, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper died in a small plane crash and Alaska and Hawaii became the 49th and 50th states. On a dreary November day of that same year, two petty crooks drove to an obscure Midwestern town named Holcomb Kansas, where one of them brutally murdered a family of four, sending shockwaves reverberating throughout America. Truman Capote was a successful writer living in New York, who at age 23 had achieved notoriety with his first book, called Other Voices, Other Rooms and was enjoying greater critical acclaim for a breezy romantic novella he had recently completed titled Breakfast at Tiffany's. With a yearning to satiate his creative hunger, Capote was looking for a sensational media event to chronicle in a non fiction story; one that would be unlike anything ever written. In mid November of 1959, while reading the New York Times, the 35 year old writer found what he was looking for.<br /><br />Capote brilliantly tells the tale of how a gifted artist followed his instincts, hopped on a train to travel to America's heartland and painstakingly assembled the narrative details of this infamous evening, by psychologically dissecting the mind of a killer. The film is a straightforward account of how this seemingly demure man used his disarming wit and superior skills of manipulation to collect the information required to fashion his masterpiece In Cold Blood. And though there is much debate over how he didn't use notes while compiling his research (a detail the movie explains by demonstrating Capote's astonishingly accurate sense of recall), it is certain he created a chilling depiction of the Clutter family massacre.<br /><br />When Truman Capote (Hoffman), arrives in Kansas with his traveling companion Harper Lee (Keener), who later wrote To Kill a Mockingbird, they are treated with indifference by authorities investigating the murder. After Truman and Harper meet and ingratiate themselves with lead investigator Alvin Dewey's (Cooper) wife Marie, the pair is introduced into the inner circle of the people examining the sordid details of the crime. When the suspects are finally apprehended, in an amusing sequence, Capote brings the Sheriff's wife breakfast to bribe his way into meet accused killer Perry Smith (Collins Jr.)<br /><br />Spending hours commiserating with him in his cramped jail cell, Capote befriends Smith when both men discover their common experience of suffering childhood abuses. After they are convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging, Truman lends his assistance in securing more competent legal counsel for Smith and his partner in crime Richard Hitchcock (Mark Pellegrino). This positions him as less of a journalist and more as an active participant in case; as the killers, particularly Smith, form an attachment to him. When Dewey reads the newspaper about the writer's involvement on behalf of the condemned men, he warns Truman if they escape justice, he will come to New York, track him down and kill him.<br /><br />With the original intent of writing a human interest article for New Yorker Magazine, it becomes clear to Truman that the Clutter family story would provide him with a sensational novel. With half of his manuscript completed, he sends it to William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his New York publisher. Astonished at the quality of the work, he informs Truman he will have a profound influence on the landscape of the literary world. Subsequently, Shawn has Capote perform a reading of excerpts from his unfinished novel, where he receives a standing ovation. After the enormous buzz created by this promotional event, the die is cast and Truman must follow the story to the increasingly bitter endto faithfully record the fate of Smith and Hickcock.<br /><br />In his quest to complete In Cold Blood, Truman Capote was compelled to invest five emotionally draining years of his life. He became not only a witness but was actively drawn into the aftermath of a violent nightmare, to become the primary confidant of a consummately evil criminal. Yet Capote saw him as a sensitive, scared little boy underneath the nefarious veneer. This took a toll on his mental health and nearly caused him to miss the finale of the story. In a deeply revealing scene, publisher Shawn telephones Harper Lee to prevail upon her friend to visit the murderous duo on their last night on earth. It takes every measure of Truman's moral courage to meet with Hickcock and Smith; and upon their final request, watch their executions.<br /><br />For his work on Capote, director Bennett Miller has fully realized the classic story of how in his quest to gain the world, a man loses his soul. After writing In Cold Blood, Truman became the most celebrated author in America but never wrote another book. The film gives you an intimate look at how such a gifted novelist invested so much in one project, to the point where he never had the desire to complete another one. Additionally, Miller uses the bleak gray Kansas atmosphere to reinforce the ominous fate that lies ahead for the killers and the endless waiting game Capote faces as he awaits their execution.<br /><br />Though released in late September, Capote is once again making the rounds at your local movie theatre, as it will certainly garner an Oscar nomination for Philip Seymour Hoffman. Though all the acting is uniformly excellent, Hoffman's performance as the flamboyant Capote is masterwork of a journeyman performer. He is in nearly every single frame of the film and never loses character for a nanosecond. He is your guide in telling the story within the story. In a somewhat spotty year for meaty plot lines, this is a motion picture that offers a glimpse at one of the most interesting dramas ever told. In Cold Blood became an American version of a Greek Tragedy; one where even the storyteller was unable to remain unscathed.<br /><br />Reviewed by<br /><br />Phillip E.

Disc #2 is especially awesome, even though she's doing what Madonna did 15 years ago with \\"I'm Breathless.\\" And Christina actually crosses more genres than Madge did, from the '20s to the '60s. <br /> <br />Anyone who has a problem with this album needs to check their musical taste meter. This proves that the trashy girl has an amazing command of her voice and every song she belts out. Go back and listen to the greats like Etta James and Billie Holliday and see if this doesn't rank up there with them.

It's so true that the fine line between reason and religion is ever so fragile, and that, despite our best efforts, there will always be terrorism in the world.  As I came to the part in the book where the author claimed that Israel would incite a massive war between the mideast and the west, war had just broken out between Israel and Hezbollah, with the conflict in Iraq still raging, and tensions between Iran and the rest of the West further increasing.  It startled me into believing that the conflict between people in this world over whose god is god will someday incite a global catastrophe.
0312263511|2.0|Gene Cernan is one of America's most experienced and successful astronauts. His three missions were among the most ambitious, successful and exciting of all time. He spent more time, along with partner Harrison Schmitt, than any other man walking on the moon. It was, therefore, with great disappointment that I read this book. What I expect from a book by an astronaut is to really feel and understand what the unique experiences they went through were like and what challenges-physical, mental and technical they overcame. With the notable exception of Mike Collins' autobiography almost none of the astronauts books really provide this. Only 12 men have ever stood on the moon and yet they have not really conveyed what this and other aspects of spaceflight were like in their autobiographies. He dismisses his epic Apollo 17 flight in a few pages and spends more time talking about the politics of crew selection, giving crude descriptions of his wife's figure and other trivia. Also there is a lack of illustrations showing the alien environment he explored so well. Most of the astronauts who wrote autobiographies felt they had to talk down to their audience to make the book attractive to the average reader, thus leaving out much technical information that is actually quite interesting, even for the non-technically-minded layman.  The popularity of the film \\"Apollo 13\\" and the television series \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" in which technical matters were not shied away from proves this is not true.  The fact is the true intelligence and abilities of these men is measured in what they did on their space missions, not as golfers or in planning practical jokes or in celebrity namedropping.  In a more positive light, he reveals for the first time the real dangers the Gemini spacewalks entailed and gives a good description of the problems Ed White encountered in Gemini 4 and his own nightmarish experience in Gemini 9. <br /> <br />
B000000W5L|5.0|'Ya know, this one might just be \\"it\\".  It being one of the best albums ever.  It has rock, country, soul, R&B, punk and whatever else you might expect from a Stones album.  These boys were at the top of their game in 1972 and the result shows clearly in this two LP/one CD tome.  It's as eclectic as they come... all types being equal.  Give it a try, boys and girls... you're not likely to be disappointed.
0778321606|5.0|I have never knitted a stitch in my life, and after reading this wonderful heartwarming book, I signed up for lessons! The first of two novels (and I hope the books go on and on and on), this is the story of a two-time cancer survivor in her early 30s, Lydia, who takes a stab at life by opening her own knitting store with a small inheritance. Lydia's sister Margaret, who had deeply resented their parents' wholehearted attention to Lydia during her teenaged cancer years, predicts that the shop will fail; the reader isn't so optimistic either.<br /><br />But the first thing Lydia does is start a knitting class, and the three women who join are as disparate as can possibly be. Jacqueline is a very rich, but very bitter woman who loathes the woman who has married her only and pampered son. Carole is in the throes of tragic fertility problems; she has one more attempt at in-vitro to go, and then must give up the hope of a child, or wait many years for a suitable adoption. Alix, she of the purple spiked hair and goth clothing, is a twenty-something who is working off a community-service sentence for drugs found in her apartment--that belong to her roommate.<br /><br />As we get to know each woman, we watch their lives meld like their stitches as they learn their craft...not perfect, not effortless, but so rewarding. And the beginning of each chapter has a mesmerizing quote, taken from many knitting sources, about the joys of knitting.<br /><br />I was and am hooked. I can't wait to continue to the next book, and I highly recommend this series whether you are a knitter or not!
B000FVRACK|5.0|I watched this 1975 film presentation of Artur Rubinstein playing the Grieg A minor, Chopin F minor (No. 2) and Saint Saens G minor (No. 2) Piano concertos with Andre Previn and the London Symphony on PBS television in 1978.  DG's release of this on DVD is cause for rejoicing, as the picture and sound are both restored using the near miracles 2006 technology can perform on 30+ year old film and audio soundtracks.<br /><br />The sound is rich and full, and beautifully balanced between pianist Rubinstein and the great London orchestra.  This was recorded without audience present in Croydon, England, and the effect is rather intimate, despite the large orchestral forces required for these three concertos.<br /><br />Camera work is likewise excellent and serves the music: when a passage is played by a solo flute, oboe, french horn, etc. the camera shows the given soloist within the orchestra, or Mr. Rubinstein himself.  There are enough shots of Andre Previn conducting, who is in sync with Rubinstein at every turn.  Previn's conducting style is graceful, but never demonstrative, and he does not call attention to himself.  The camera work is never a distraction from the performance.<br /><br />If you are an Artur Rubinstein fan, get this.  These recordings were made in 1975, when Mr. Rubinstein was 88 years old.  His technique and musicianship remained rock solid, even 2 years short of age 90.<br /><br />There is a valuable 30 minute interview with Robert MacNeil, filmed at Rubinstein's Paris home in 1975.  Rubinstein candidly answers questions about his life and career; the Grieg, Chopin and Saint-Saens Concertos; talks about Ravel, and what nonsense it is to call him or anyone else \\"the greatest pianist of the 20th century\\", as well as death, eternal life, and the visual arts.  \\"My God is not an old man with a beard\\" says Rubinstein: food for thought!  This interview is very fascinating, and I've watched it several times in the past two weeks.  Each time I hear Mr. Rubinstein speak, I get a different perspective, and hear something new!<br /><br />Enthusiastically recommended!instein speak, I get a different perspective, and hear something new!<br /><br />Enthusiastically recommended!
0967851408|5.0|I know this book since I was a primary school learner. My father had a signed copy. I suppose that I started to delve into this rather formidable book - for a youngster - during my high school days. I struggled, but instinctively knew that it was a great book - so I persevered. I can truly say that I have used this volume throughout my live since then, and have inherited my father's copy! As the title states, this is not a book, it is really a system. It is a system that will change your view on life and then will consequently change your life too. Although a spiritual book, I have found it to be the most practical spiritual book I have ever read!<br /><br />The Master Key System is simply one of the finest studies in personal power, metaphysics, and prosperity consciousness ever written. Covering everything from how to create abundance and wealth to how to get healthy, Charles F Haanel leaves no stone unturned. With precision, he elucidates on each topic with logic and rigor that not only leaves you feeling good, but also thinking good. The book was banned by the Catholic Church in 1933 and has been hidden away for decades.
015626224X|5.0|Orwell's DOWN & OUT is an amazing book--witty, finely observed, unsentimental, and utterly absorbing. Reminds me of Jack London's PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS, which was a journalistic foray into London's slums circa 1903--about 20 or 25 years before Orwell gave his account of what it was like to be destitute, despised, dirty, and lowdown in Paris and London in the years after WWI. A brilliant, haunting book...
B000002O1Q|5.0|Jim Steinman & Ry Cooder knocked this out of the park with their songs...it captures a time that exists between the cracks of the decades.\\"Tonight is what it Means to Be Young\\" is perhaps the strongest tune on the album and is a standout in the film, however every song is a gem.The entire CD is a great listen for a long summer day......in someways the film is the Rock & Roll \\"Bladerunner\\".

B000HC2LIK|5.0|Well... here's the deal...<br /><br />Blade Runner stands as one of those films whose editting and final cut were always a subject for debate. As you may know there are two known cuts of this film: the original theatrical version (shunned by many who claimed it was a producer's cut who did not believe in Scott's true vision) and the director's cut (which is not really the director's cut... it is more a screenplay's cut... with some changes who merely unmade some of the things the producers did on the previous cut).<br /><br />It is this second version that you will find here (while the first version is no longer available) with a face lift... a new transfer... better sound... and that's it.<br /><br />In one way, this version is badly needed because all the previous Blade Runner DVD incarnations come from the first years of DVD - when you didn't even have a decent menu. And since the DVD technology has evolved a lot since then... why not a new version of Blade Runner, right?<br /><br />But.......<br /><br />The mystique surrounding Blade Runner says that director Ridley Scott never REALLY got HIS REAL version of this film. And more... A such an important and much loved film like this should have lots of extras to bring a new light to a film that is so fundamental and trendsetting.<br /><br />And it seems that after 25 years, all the legal problems preventing all this from happenning were really sorted out between the film's former producers who battled for years for the film's rights.<br /><br />And now, with all problems solved, we know that in 2007, we'll have that multi-disc version all the fans always dreamt of.<br /><br />SO, THE DEAL IS... IF YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT THIS VERSION, BUY THIS EDITION. The good thing is you won't even go through those stupid snap cases anymore. Even if you already have it, the better image and sound on this release will certainly make up for it.<br /><br />BUT IF YOU CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING LESS THAT THE WHOLE MULTI-DISC EDITION COMPRISING ALL THE VERSIONS AND TONS OF EXTRAS... forget about this version and wait a few months for the longer, bigger, more complete, celebratory, multi versioned, multi disc set that will give you the FULL BLADE RUNNER deal.<br /><br />It will cost more, naturally, but we've been saving money for it since our childhood, right? ;-)<br /><br />I'm a big fan. So I'll wait. This version is a quick, just and much needed repairment: a great new transfer (with no extras) for those who just want the film. An entry level I'd say. And I think it is good that Warner Home Video has this version for those who just want the film - at bargain price.<br /><br />But more is coming in 2007. In full!!<br />So, I'll wait impatiently!!!!!version and wait a few months for the longer, bigger, more complete, celebratory, multi versioned, multi disc set that will give you the FULL BLADE RUNNER deal.

B000002KHH|3.0|I am a 43 year old rocker. The legend of Black Sabbath is larger then the reality. Nobody really liked them in the 70s. I saw them open up for Blondie!<br /><br />I have been a critic on Black Sabbath for a long time. I would go out of my way to rip them.<br /><br />Lately, I heard War Pigs on the radio. It sounded pretty damn good. Then at a Flaming Lips concert, they did a cover of War Pigs and it was awesome. Maybe I was wrong?!<br /><br />I now apologize for being too judgemental. In the right place and time, music off of this album can rock the house down
B00002EPMF|5.0|This is a bit of a departure from Chuck's Death days with the tempo changes and all out thrash. The tempo changes are there of course, but the balls to wall Death is missing. This can be seen as a good thing. Fans of Death will find much to appreciate on this album (just look at who is on this 'Supergroup' album ! Digiorgio and Christy. Absolute monsters! <br /> This album is much more in the vein of power or prog metal than death metal and the tempos can be slightly slower than before, but some of Chuck's best compositions are found here. 'Expect The Unexpected' is a definite masterpiece worthy of Chuck. Tim Aymar's voice is a nice change, sounding at times like Bruce Dickinson, though he cannot hit nearly the same high notes. This album will be an improvement for Death fans who detest Chuck's voice (though I think it's not half-bad...would you rather have Chris Barnes? or the guy from Obituary? I think not!) In summation, pick this album up is you are a Death fan, techinical metal fan, or have ever heard DiGiorgio. He really shines on this album. Hopefully Chuck's mom's lawsuit will free up the release of the second album, which the other members support. Enjoy!
B000E41MS6|5.0|For fans of the original Doctor Who, rest assured - this is still the Doctor we know and love. Here are but a few things you will recognize:<br /><br />1. The Doctor can't seem to control the TARDIS.<br /><br />2. The Doctor takes offense at the suggestion that he can't control the TARDIS.<br /><br />3. The people from UNIT are useless.<br /><br />4. An enemy uses the Doctor's emotions against him.<br /><br />5. The Doctor thinks a companion is dead, and it's his fault.<br /><br />6. A companion thinks the Doctor is dead, and it's her fault.<br /><br />7. The Doctor is strapped to a table and tortured.<br /><br />8. Something pulls the TARDIS off course - not that it was going where it was supposed to, anyway.<br /><br />9. The Doctor makes vague passing references to famous events of the past, as if he's been there.<br /><br />10. The Doctor refuses to use violence.<br /><br />11. The Doctor becomes violent.<br /><br />12. The Doctor seems amused by things that aren't particularly amusing.<br /><br />13. The Doctor boasts of being able to go anywhere in space and time, but somehow always ends up on or around the earth.<br /><br />14. The Doctor is always the only person who can come up with a solution to save the day.<br /><br />15. The Doctor never changes clothes, never showers, and never needs a shave.<br /><br />16. The sonic screwdriver.<br /><br />17. Autons.<br /><br />Of course, there are some things that will appear new and baffling to fans of the original series. For example:<br /><br />1. The TARDIS lands on earth, but not in England. (Well, okay, this did happen once or twice in the original, but only the staunchest fans will remember it.)<br /><br />2. A Dalek that's actually scary. For a few moments, it's terrifying.<br /><br />3. Innuendo. Boy, was that a no-no way back when.<br /><br />4. A companion who actually has a home to go to.<br /><br />5. CGI.<br /><br />6. Slitheen. (Personally, I could pass. Give me big lumbering Ice Warriors or fuzzy Yeti any day. Or better yet, giant bugs made of bubble wrap.)<br /><br />So who's the real Who?<br /><br />Only you can decide.<br /><br />For my money, I love them both!br />Only you can decide. <br /> <br />For my money, I love them both!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|9 months after relaease, I still keep listening to it as if it was new. It doesnt wear you out, it relaxes you and at the same time makes you want to move your feet: do not mind the lyrics, mind the sound of music, let it enter your mind and you will pass 1 hour of your life without complaining....
B000G75AE8|5.0|The best album in years!  A great mix of the old and new styles.  Fast, aggressive, loud, very catchy.  These riffs and lyrics stick in my head for hours after I listen.  Good diversity in lyrical content, but still has some of the Jesus, religion, God sucks stuff.  Any Slayer fan of any era will definitely find something appealing on this album.  Highly recommnended!
B000C20VPA|5.0|Casino is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. There are plenty of other reviews that go into details on this, so I will simply say that it is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />This DVD edition is the best version out there, and surprisingly, it's cheaper than the Anniversary Edition (which is a \\"flipper\\", and has had some playback problems). This version plays and looks great. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br />Movie- 5/5 <br /> <br />DVD- 4.5/5 (I only wish there were a few more extras.)
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|It took a while for this classic concert to be released on DVD but it was well worth it!!! Rhino gives this concert the royal treatment on 2 DVD's!!! Disc 1 has the classic \\"The Concert For Bangladesh\\" and Disc 2 has the extras!!! Great sound too!!! Also includes a nice booklet!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B0009A21R6|5.0|I have a middle of the road high end 5.1 audio system and it came to life with this SACD. The sound quality is magic. I can only hope that I can locate other SACD's out there than can compare in quality of music and recording excellence.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|It's been a long time since I last saw this, and that was on VHS tape.  <br /> <br />This DVD does not fail in bringing it all home. Loaded with extras and lots of missing songs that the VHS version couldn't slip in. With the glorious remastering of the sound for 5.1 you will indeed appreciate it if you have a surround sound system. <br /> <br />Definately the best live music DVD in existance. If only the Floyd would stop the bickering and reunite.
B000GGSM7G|4.0|I've read other customers' comments about \\"Shake Dog Shake's\\" drum roll being edited.  I've been listening to this album for sixteen years now and have NO idea what they're talking about.  It sounds perfect!<br /><br />\\"Bananfishbones\\" is indeed sped up, but another customer states that this is a correction of faulty original mastering.  I think it sounds much livelier now and can't believe what I've been missing all this time!<br /><br />At any rate, this deluxe version is INCREDIBLE.  The sound quality is nothing short of superb.  If you liked 'The Top' the first time around, don't hesitate to purchase this one.  You're in for a completely new, amazing listening experience!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Having seen this Dvd before and greatly enjoyed it, I was keen to get myself a copy. For any fan of Eric Clapton, it's a must-buy. All the other 'greats' who perform on this show simply add value to it! The recording quality is as good as to be expected. I only wish some more of the original concert could have been added.
B0002DRDBE|4.0|I must say that I really did enjoy Clerks yet, to my surprise, it was not the laugh out loud movie I thought it would be. It certainly had the charactics of a film students class project. It allowed you to capture the sense of monotany that everyday retail clerks can relate to, while at the sametime showing the real fun of working in a retail situation. I don't mean to sound like I was disapointed, I certainly was not, I just was expecting something different considering all of the hype I had heard. Jay and Silent Bob are certainly a funny pair, just not bust out loud in this perticular appearance. (see this BEFORE you see the sequal)
B000BTC5LW|4.0|This is a concert which I had on Vcd several years ago and was  excited to know was now available on Dvd for the first time, so I ordered it rightaway. Having seen it, I have to say I was somewhat disappointed at the quality of transcription,surely the original tapes could have been improved upon. However,it's still worth having for any fan of the band or rock enthusiast.
0679722610|2.0|Dashiel Hammett, author of such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON and THE THIN MAN, certainly deserves credit as one of the originators of the noir genre. Unfortunately RED HARVEST doesn't live up to this reputation.<br /><br /> RED HARVEST starts with the Continental Op arriving in the mining town of Personville (sometimes called Poisonville). He has been hired by the editor of the local paper, who turns up dead. This editor is also the son of mining magnate Elihu Willsson, who had called in a collection of hooligans to break a strike. What he had not foreseen was the inevitability the criminals would take over the town.<br /><br /> Originally I had the idea the \\"red\\" in the title had something to do with the socialist workers movement or the Wobblies, a logical assumption since Hammett was a communist, but Hammett settles for the obvious, the red meaning murder after murder as  the Continental Op turns the criminals against each other.<br /><br /> A blurb on the back of the book lauds Hammett for \\"sharply and economically defined\\" characters. They're sharply defined all right, so sharply defined that they all run together. Pete the Finn, Lew Yard, Max Thaler and Noonan, the chief of police, could be the same character. At the beginning of the novel, the Continental Op learns the history of conflict from Bill Quint, an I.W.W. organizer from Chicago, but that's pretty much the last we hear from him.<br /><br /> About the only interesting character in the whole book is the femme fatale, Dinah Brand, but her sole motivation seems to be money.<br /><br /> Hammett also has problems with resolution of conflict. When painted into a corner, he simply kills off another character.<br /><br /> Even the Continental Op is pretty much a cipher. He doesn't seem to have much of a background, other than that he's somewhat afraid of the Old Man, who runs the Continental Detective Agency. We know he smokes and drinks too much and even takes cocaine, but other than that he doesn't live up to his cool name. Unfortunately all of this reads like a bad comic book. Even Hammett would have a good laugh at what the New York Times said about RED HARVEST, I would assume in 1929 when it was published: \\"RED HARVEST is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain.\\" I'll give him two stars for noir dialogue, but the rest of it is pretty much dreck.doesn't live up to his cool name.

0385338686|2.0|This doesn't come NEAR her other novels. This book was tough to get into, never really went anywhere, and honestly, it was boring. I could barely finish it. I say avoid it. This happens with alot of successful writers. They get a good book (Shopaholic), and then start churning out trash. This isn't trash, but it's not good either.
0800177177|5.0|I was disappointed in this movie on its offical theatrical release, I was expecting a horror film not a love story. I saw it twice in theatres just for my love of WINONA RYDER and grew to accept its plot of eternal love. GARY OLDMAN rocked the house with this performance as Dracula, and RYDER'S beauty is undeniable. Visually stunting, Gothically romantic. Other than that save your money. If you love goth, romance, and RYDER recommended.
0553801503|4.0|George R.R. Martin's epic fantasy series continues.  The scope of his series is staggering:  the number of characters, plots and backstory is always impressive.  I look forward to his next book.  A Storm of Swords was a highlight to the series.  A Feast for Crows seems a bridge to the home stretch of A Song of Ice and Fire.  Bottom Line:  If you're into the series, you must read it.  You won't be disappointed, but resolution is not in the cards just yet.
1400079179|5.0|I resisted reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" for some time because of all the hoopla, and the fact that I had found the three previous Dan Brown novels that I had read less than satisfying. This is clearly his best effort. It's fast-paced, suspenseful, has sympathetic characters, and contains enough esoterica to keep even the most erudite reader's attention. As a stand-alone novel, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />What puzzles me is why so many people have been offended by it. The account of early church history up through the Council of Nicaea is completely factual, as is the description of how pagan traditions and holidays were co-opted by the early Christians. The suggestion that Mary Magdalene and Jesus married sounds like something taken out of the annals of the Inquisition, and is not really new. After that, the stories about Merovingians, Templars, Masons, etc., can be found in dozens of other books.<br /><br />If you are a fundamentalist who thinks the Harry Potter novels are dangerous, then you'd be advised to stay away from this. If you're simply looking for an enjoyable romp through a page-turner, then have at it!
B000005Z0E|5.0|a rare cd to find
B000G759LW|5.0|After four years of anticipation, Christina's third album has arrived. Back To Basics is \\"a throwback to the 20's, 30's, and 40's with a modern twist\\". The first disc is the `modern disc' which features a homage to jazz, blues, and soul, and the second disc is produced entirely by Linda Perry and has the 20's and 30's vibe. Overall, Back To Basics is a solid album that oozes soul and clearly has elements of jazz, blues, and classic R&B.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Christina from the beginning, but around the `Stripped' era I became tired of her strained vocals and her `dirrty' antics. I was a lesser fan than I had been before and I didn't pay so much attention to Christina. When I heard about the direction she was going in for this new album, it caught my interest again, especially the part about it being 20's, 30's, and 40's influenced. This album has recaptured my attention and renewed a bit of my faith in Christina.<br /><br />As a fan or the 20's, 30's, and 40's era, I wish Christina would have made more of her album sound authentic to that era instead of just a couple songs. But nevertheless, I believe that her album will become one of the classics of our time.<br /><br />Intro (Back To Basics) - Christina introduces the album and what it is about. She sings about paying homage to the legends before her time.<br /><br />Makes Me Wanna Pray - This is a gospel, praise song that makes you feel like you're in church and the whole crowd is up on their feet moving and singing along.<br /><br />Back In The Day - A very soulful track. There is the sound of a record crackling all throughout, and the beat is awesome. Christina names and sings about some of the legends like Etta James, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder, and a few others.<br /><br />Ain't No Other Man - A song about her husband Jordan \\"Jordy\\" Bratman. It has distinctive horns and a modern beat. Christina belts most of the song and her vocals are clear and razor sharp.<br /><br />Understand - Contains a sample Betty Harris' \\"Nearer To You\\" and has an old school vibe. Another song that is about her relationship with Jordy.<br /><br />Slow Down Baby - One of the catchiest tracks in my opinion, and R&B at its best. The melody and the horns in it are great.<br /><br />Oh Mother - About her father's abuse towards her mother and her and how they made it through. It is like a continuation of \\"I'm Okay\\" from her `Stripped' CD, only this song is more of a dedication to her mother. The lyrics are very touching. Musically, my favorite part is the bridge because it contains a great vocal.<br /><br />F.U.S.S. - An interlude, directed toward producer Scott Storch. It's a shame it's not an actual full length song, because I love the beat and sound of this. It's very bluesy and laid back.<br /><br />On Our Way - There is a piano throughout most of the song, and it builds nicely from the bridge on.<br /><br />Without You - Christina sings softly and smoothly on this track, with more lush, pop like vocals. The track is reminiscent of something Mariah would do, and it sounds similar to Christina's \\"Loving Me For Me\\" on her `Stripped' CD.<br /><br />Still Dirrty - Christina expressing her views on being, well, `dirrty'. An ode to her \\"Dirrty\\" song of off `Stripped.' It's R&B with a taste of funk and it's got a great beat.<br /><br />Here To Stay - A jazz/R&B fused track. The lyrics have an inspirational message. \\"I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna do my own thing. We've all got a song that we're meant to sing.\\"<br /><br />Thank You - A dedication to her fans. Christina thanks them, and the song has excerpts from \\"Genie In A Bottle\\", the song that started her career. There are fans voices throughout the song thanking Christina and telling how she's inspired them.<br /><br />Enter The Circus - The music sounds like what you would hear at a carnival. Christina isn't present in this short interlude, but a person talks throughout, 'advertising' the circus: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, step right up, step right up.\\"<br /><br />Welcome - A song about fame and how it's not all that it appears to be. \\"Always taking a bow, always working the crowd...who'll be staying around when the lights go down?\\" It's sort of a ballad towards the middle, and Christina belts it out quite nicely. My favorite part is when she sings \\"You're riding on a shooting star\\". Then the song dies down and the circus music starts again, and someone whistles along with the music.<br /><br />Candyman - Love it!! It's the most 30's/40's sounding song on the entire album - very swing, very jazzy, very big band. It is slightly reminiscent of The Andrews Sisters \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\". The lyrics are a little naughty in places. My favorite parts are the men singing in cadence at the beginning and end of the song, and when Christina whispers \\"sweet, sugar, candyman.\\"<br /><br />Nasty Naughty Boy - You guessed it - this song has some naughty lyrics also. I'm not much of a fan for sexually suggestive lyrics, but this song is so nicely put together that it works. It was made to sound like a live track with the audience clapping and whistling. Christina sounds like she is in a 20's burlesque club, singing this to entertain the men in the crowd. It's slow and jazzy at the beginning, and then it builds nicely at the end. Christina's vocals sound great on this track.<br /><br />I Got Trouble - Very reminiscent of an old blues record. When Christina was in the studio, she covered the microphone with a rag to create a muffled effect. She even scats a bit in the middle of the song.<br /><br />Hurt - This is a heart-wrenching ballad about losing someone and having regret about things that were said and done. \\"I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do. And I've hurt myself by hurting you.\\" Christina actually sings straight throughout most of this track, and employs more vibrato than her usual adlibs and runs. The lyrics are haunting, and they made me cry. \\"Are you looking down upon me? Are you proud of who I am?\\" Very powerful song, lyrically and vocally.<br /><br />Mercy On Me - A confessional song about how she has sinned. She is asking the Lord to have mercy on her soul. Musically, it's very blues inspired.<br /><br />Save Me From Myself - Vocally, it's a different side of Christina that we don't see too often. She recorded the song up close to the microphone with no adlibs or belting at all. She sings in a soft voice and there is very minimal music. It's the kind of song that makes you want to be still when you listen to it. Dedicated to her husband Jordy.<br /><br />The Right Man - I love the music on this song. It sounds like a classical song. It has a huge orchestra with no drum or beat of any kind. The vocals are clear and the whole song has a very dramatic feel. It's about Christina's wedding, and the lyrics are very touching. It makes you feel happy for her.<br /><br />That's all. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music.'advertising' the circus: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, step right up, step right up.\\" <br /> <br />Welcome - A song about fame and how it's not all that it appears to be. \\"Always taking a bow, always working the crowd...who'll be staying around when the lights go down?\\" It's sort of a ballad towards the middle, and Christina belts it out quite nicely. My favorite part is when she sings \\"You're riding on a shooting star\\". Then the song dies down and the circus music starts again, and someone whistles along with the music.  <br /> <br />Candyman - Love it!! It's the most 30's/40's sounding song on the entire album - very swing, very jazzy, very big band. It is slightly reminiscent of The Andrews Sisters \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\". The lyrics are a little naughty in places. My favorite parts are the men singing in cadence at the beginning and end of the song, and when Christina whispers \\"sweet, sugar, candyman.\\" <br /> <br />Nasty Naughty Boy - You guessed it - this song has some naughty lyrics also. I'm not much of a fan for sexually suggestive lyrics, but this song is so nicely put together that it works. It was made to sound like a live track with the audience clapping and whistling. Christina sounds like she is in a 20's burlesque club, singing this to entertain the men in the crowd. It's slow and jazzy at the beginning, and then it builds nicely at the end. Christina's vocals sound great on this track. <br /> <br />I Got Trouble - Very reminiscent of an old blues record. When Christina was in the studio, she covered the microphone with a rag to create a muffled effect. She even scats a bit in the middle of the song. <br /> <br />Hurt - This is a heart-wrenching ballad about losing someone and having regret about things that were said and done. \\"I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do. And I've hurt myself by hurting you.\\" Christina actually sings straight throughout most of this track, and employs more vibrato than her usual adlibs andruns. The lyrics are haunting, and they made me cry. \\"Are you looking down upon me? Are you proud of who I am?\\" Very powerful song, lyrically and vocally.  <br /> <br />Mercy On Me - A confessional song about how she has sinned. She is asking the Lord to have mercy on her soul. Musically, it's very blues inspired. <br /> <br />Save Me From Myself - Vocally, it's a different side of Christina that we don't see too often. She recorded the song up close to the microphone with no adlibs or belting at all. She sings in a soft voice and there is very minimal music. It's the kind of song that makes you want to be still when you listen to it. Dedicated to her husband Jordy. <br /> <br />The Right Man - I love the music on this song. It sounds like a classical song. It has a huge orchestra with no drum or beat of any kind. The vocals are clear and the whole song has a very dramatic feel. It's about Christina's wedding, and the lyrics are very touching. It makes you feel happy for her. <br /> <br />That's all. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Finally, in the fall of 2004; Green Day released their next and most contrevesial record: AMERICAN IDIOT. One would have thought with the four year absence of the punk rock group, that Green Day had finally fallen apart. This album displays the complete opposite. Green Day returned from the studio stronger and more aggressive than ever. Taking on rebel personas and attire, band members perform their music better than ever. There's more recoginizable harmonies and melodies. Guitars perform great counterpoint. Pieces are longer than just four minutes but have identifiable ABA forms. Green Day also adds more unique modes to their rock progressions and it stands out remarkably. And of course, Green Day went incredibly political for this album. Released right before the 2004 Presidential Elections, AMERICAN IDIOT caused major contrevesial issues on the political spectrum. The main reason: Green Day obviously is not a Bush Administration supporter and make points about the current federal government making it look not so functional in our democracy. Major props to Green Day for taking a stand and not being afraid to say what they truly think about The Bush Administration. This type of speech is apparent throughout the entire record, but is more identifiable for specific tracks. The track \\"American Idiot\\" tells about the band's view on the federal government using fear to gain control. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" deals with religion and citizen's class status within the country. \\"Holiday\\" flat out shows that Green Day opposes the invasion and occupation of Iraq under the orders of President Bush. \\"She's A Rebel\\" is a patriotic piece. \\"Homecoming\\" declares that Green Day supports the troops by wanting to bring them back home and out of danger. People can agree or disagree as much as they want about the work Green Day has done on this album, but it all comes down to their basic First Amendment right of Free Speech. AMERICAN IDIOT is a remarkable punk rock album for all of these reasons and a must have for any music collection.    Stand out tracks include:  \\"American Idiot\\"  \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\"  \\"Holiday\\"  \\"Give Me Novacaine\\"  \\"She's A Rebel\\"  \\"Homecoming\\"  \\"Whatsermane\\"
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Great movie. It's smart and creative with a dark sense of humor - a rarity at the box office these days. The whole thing is a great twist on the classic film noir detective genre. Once you accept that the premise is kind of a wink-wink to the audience (obviously it's unrealistic but that's the point) you'll definitely enjoy the ride. And who would have thought the kid from Third Rock could take a punch like that?
B0002858YS|4.0|In the summer of 2004, the rock band: The Killers made their debut with their first record: HOT FUSS. The album was amazing and an outstanding performance compared to other sounds that were being played at the time. The Killers have a very destinct synthisized sound to numerous rock and soul progressions. The synthisizers create very unique harmonies and melodies. Tons of passing chords are generated with these instruments and add a pop dance feel to the songs' progressions. The Killers themselves know how to obtain amazing sounds from their instruments and perform them well. The drums are in time and perform very complicated rhythms. The bass is the foundation to the band's sound, and yet has very interesting harmonic lines. The guitars play mostly chord progressions and effect qualities. But they are derived from many of the diatonic scale members, that the chords become pretty melodic. It also creates amazing and recognizable key changes. The singer has a great sense of time and an awesome range. This gives HOT FUSS' pieces a great contour and dynamic sound. This album landed The Killers tons of airplay and a guest performance for the second season of the television show The OC. HOT FUSS is a remarkable album and has paved the way to a new sound in rock. Music fans, you have got to hear this one. It will leave listeners to wander what SAM'S TOWN will sound like when released on October 3rd, 2006.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"Mr. Brightside\\" <br />\\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" <br />\\"Somebody Told Me\\" <br />\\"All These Things That I've Done\\" <br />\\"Change Your Mind\\" <br />\\"Believe Me Natalie\\"

0767818040|5.0|...with my parents.<br /><br />I'll never forget seeing this movie in the theaters with my parents.  We happen to see the quite young daughter of a really good couple friend of my parents, right before we went into the theater to watch this.  My parents had no idea how bad this one was.  My mother, just out of the blue, invited the young lady to join us. Brian DePalma has always been one of my favorite directors, and I only had a slight hint of how bad/good this would be.  Well, I don't need to tell you the rest of the story, if you've seen this movie.  My parents apologized profusely to her parents, later after we watched it.  AND I WAS LOVING IT!!!<br /><br />I bought this on laser disc right when it came out, and recently, about 1 year ago, bought the DVD.  I really like the movie, one of my favorite Brian DePalma flicks.  I'll tell you some of my favorite parts.<br /><br />1) The music playing, when Scully, the Craig Wasson character, gets excused from his movie scene, and is driving home to spend some unexpected quality time with his live in girlfriend.  That is probably the greatest sound track music I've ever heard, by Pino Donaggio.<br /><br />2) The edit cuts, between the viewing of the murder, through the eyeglass, that Scully is looking through, and the real life view, in the living room of the murder victim.  I still remember the sound effects and cries of pain by the actress.<br /><br />3) The twirling effect of the cameras, when Scully and the female are kissing no the beach (no, it didn't make me dizzy, like other reviewers.)<br /><br />4) The \\"B\\" Acting of Melanie Griffith.  You' d think she really was a porn star, the way she's acting.<br /><br />5) The police detective that interviews Scully.  That guy was so creepy.  Reminds me of the actor Fred Gwynne.  Very entertaining.<br /><br />Rent or buy this movie, and you shall not be disappointed.<br /><br />Little known fact about this movie:  Brian DePalma interviewed a real porn star (can't think of her name off hand, but she was extremely popular at the time this movie was being made) and rejected her based on her poor acting skills.  Too bad they don't include her trial tapes in the DVD extras  That would be bangin'!!!  There is a book I own, called Double DePalma, which gives in great details the behind the scenes of this movie.  I just checked, and it is also available for as little as $2.11.  I highly recommend that item too.<br /><br />Dubyac99 aka MC White said:  Ch-ch-ch-check it out!!! EDIT: I'm the 69th reviewer of this version?  Coincidence?

B000G1ALRK|5.0|Country music is supposed to be the music of the blue collar worker, the anthem of everyday people, and that's exactly how Eric Church sings it.  His first radio single, \\"How 'Bout You\\", is a country song to the core, with a beat very like Dierks Bentleys' \\"Lot Of Leavin' Left To Do\\".  \\"Before She Does\\", \\"Sinners Like Me\\", and \\"Pledge Allegiance To the Hag\\" all echo the same message in different ways; hard work, belief in God, American and blue collar pride, and rocking country.  Every song is good, with \\"Two Pink Lines\\", a song about teenage 'troubles' (ie is she pregnant)and \\"What I Almost Was\\", a song expressing thanks for not doing what seemed to be best at the time, being especially noteworthy.  If you like Toby Keith or Aaron Tippin (blue collar singers), you will like Eric Church.  In my opinion, this is the best album thus far this year, and I hope that Church will be just as good in his next album.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|I would have to say this was the most reasonably priced gift set DVD I've ever bought.  How come the special releases for other movies like Sin City and Pulp Fiction are over $30 or more, but this was $14.99?  I bought it, and it wasn't even on sale.<br /><br />The superbit presentation presented on an HD TV, with component video cables is the best DVD picture I have ever seen!  I could not believe my eyes!  I loved the visuals, the beautiful countryside filming, and the shootouts.  All in all, a great presentation!<br /><br />I worked in a movie theater at the time this movie was in theaters, and I must have seen it 10 times when in the theater.  My mother came to see it, and I watched it with her on my off day from work.  It's that good!<br /><br />I love a good western, and this movie lived up to its reputation, very well!<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />MC White said:  Yeee haw!  This movie rocks!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I haven't seen this on Broadway, but I saw a stunning production in Hershey a few years ago. However, this movie is nothing to scoff at. Adapting a play for the big screen has many hurdles, and of course it won't be the same as in the theater, but doesn't anyone want to bring part of that experience into their home, aside from just having the soundtrack? Give these people credit for having interest in doing it and not writing off all musicals as frivolous and/or stupid. And at least most of the actors are from the original cast, unlike Chicago (although it was much more successful, perhaps due to big name stars).<br /><br />It was neat to see such vivid settings as opposed to a bare bones stage. In Roger's song Glory, I loved seeing the flashbacks of him with blond, short hair, meeting the woman who later gave him HIV. And in the Tango Maureen, watching the rundown building transform into a fancy ballroom with marble floors and chandeliers, all dancers in black except for Maureen, in red, was an amazing scene.<br /><br />I don't know why they chose to start off the movie with Seasons of Love, but it didn't seem to hurt much. I wasn't too impressed with the title song though. They left out some parts such as Joanne's funny lines, \\"Maureen I'm not a theater person...I'll never be a theater person!\\" but that's because she did not appear in that song. Throwing the firey trash onto the street didn't make much sense either.<br /><br />At first I thought I would be annoyed by Rosario Dawson, but was pleasantly surprised by her singing and acting talent.  I also liked seeing Jesse L. Martin outside of his detective role on Law and Order. He and Angel made a great pair. Angel is one of the most lovable characters, and Heredia was brilliant in that role.  I cry when Angel dies every time.<br /><br />Little details added a lot to the movie, such as the scene in the subway for the Santa Fe song. Collins delights some women in the train by dancing with them briefly, as well as making other passengers smile, looking happy. And when Mark and Joanne go to the Buzzline office to work out a deal, Joanne's attention is obviously focused on Maureen, watching her flirt with the secretary through the glass office wall.<br /><br />Mark's character annoyed me as usual, with his whiny voice and rarely without his camcorder. He's a \\"bleeding heart\\" (as the one homeless woman tagged him) who isn't too realistic about a lot of things, but at least he tries to make a difference. I don't believe he's trying to become rich by filming what he does; he just wants to show the world what it's like out there. I don't consider it \\"selling out\\" either for him to sell footage to Buzzline. If you need money to survive, there is no shame in doing what he did. Kind of ridiculous, really, to think of it as selling out. Take what you get, because living on principles alone can make you homeless, and then you can't do much for your cause. Last time I watched this, I joked with friends that they didn't take Mimi to the hospital near the end because that would be \\"selling out.\\" Kind of a bad joke, I guess.<br /><br />So sure, criticize it all you want (I do), but movies always have some advantages over theater, while theaters will always have advantages over movies. No adaptation is perfect, but it is clear that a lot of work went into this project, and I'm grateful that Columbus invested time and money into it. Not everyone can go to the theater, after all.ooking happy.

6300182150|5.0|Awesome College Movie.  My only regret is that I did not see this movie during my college years.  Alas, they have the DVD now!<br /><br />Yay!
6304806418|5.0|I can't imagine anyone but Madonna in this role. Many people criticize her acting (\\"such a drama queen,\\" \\"overestimates her abilities,\\" blah blah blah), but I thought she was pretty good in this one. Besides, her singing and dancing made up for anything else that could be wrong, in my opinion. Her voice is so distinctive, so strong, so closely fitting to emotions that the songs should envoke.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas was excellent too. What a voice AND what gorgeous hair. Being a huge musical and Madonna fan, I was so excited for this movie to come out...I can hardly believe it's been 10 years now. I was in 9th grade, and the \\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\\" dance mix was constantly on the radio - I even bought the single, along with the 2-disc soundtrack. I still have the ticket stub (when matinees were only [...]!) on my bulletin board.<br /><br />When the movie was over in the theater, I remember hearing the woman behind me tell her friend, \\"That's gotta win an Oscar,\\" and I agreed with her. I think it only won one oscar, though it was nominated for several. Hollywood critics tend to snub musicals, especially this one, because few of them seem to respect Madonna as an actress.<br /><br />Overall, I think Evita is highly entertaining, a perfect escape from reality, beautiful to watch. I did find it kind of funny that they tried to pass Madonna off as a 15 year old in the beginning of the movie, when she's trying to convince Magaldi to take her to the city (#5 on the soundtrack). She looked good with dark brown hair, but not any younger than her late 20s.<br /><br />My favorite songs (though I love most of them) are Rainbow High (the shopping spree) and Waltz for Eve and Che. Good Night and Thank You is pretty funny.<br /><br />The best part about this movie is that it's a complete musical. Barely any normal dialogue. The music keeps flowing and flowing, and I must have watched it more than 20 times, entranced by the music, dancing, Madonna, the vivid settings. It's time for me to upgrade to the DVD version.rsion.

B00003CXIY|5.0|It was pretty damn funny!<br /><br />This movie was recommended by my good friend, Bobby Asslong.  In most cases his recommendations are a bunch of [...], but he hit it right on, with this one!  I detest Tom Green.  He is one of those guys, who that when he fails at something (Talk Show, most of his movies, life) I actually feel happy.  And this is actually contrary to my normal personality.  I normally automatically love all Canadians.  Just kidding. I normally want people to succeed, and feel bad when they fail.<br /><br />But Tom Green is so annoying.<br /><br />Great news!  He is in only about 4 or 5 scenes in this whole movie, so you should be able to get through this movie, with little to none hatred for Mr. Green.<br /><br />I love all the characters in this movie, especially the main protagonist, who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college.  He is very likeable, and you're pulling for him the whole time.  Another thing I like this movie, is that it pulls a lot from other \\"gross out\\" teen and college flicks, but it doesn't go overboard in the gross out department.<br /><br />Tom Green plays the Voice Over explainer in the movie, and he actually does a pretty good job, without appearing stupid.<br /><br />I give this high reviews!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!
B000J103PC|2.0|I thought Meryl Streep didn't do bad movies, and now another classy starlet betrays me. The movie is completely predictable and the laugh quotient is a low 2.5 chuckles per hour. The \\"dragon lady,\\" Miranda Priestly, is not just impossible to work for, she's IMPOSSIBLE to work for. She requires her lowly, untrained, inexperienced assistant to perform miracles and menial chores every day, and we never see Miranda do anything extraordinary. Miranda mumbles her cryptic orders too fast even for a court stenographer to understand. We witness Andy, the naive, fashion-challenged new assistant, undergo a fashion and personality makeover, topping it off with an affair not to remember. We see the devastation of everyone's personal life, which isn't even good for dark humor. We hear an oddly earnest speech about the merits of a dysfunctional, destructive, and corrupt work ethic. And in the rarefied and cutthroat atmosphere of high fashion we see Andy regain her sense of humanity, not to save herself, but to protect her abuser's \\"delicate\\" feelings. Well, they had to contrive a happy ending somehow.
B000G75AE8|5.0|It seems whenever Bands announce the return of former bandmembers to form their original act We as fans often get our hopes up for thier original sound and really set the bar high.This is usually followed by the well anticipated release only to have our hopes dashed by either a really bad sounding production or a complete change in musical format altogether.This is NOT the case with this AMAZING release!!!\\"CHRIST ILLUSION\\" is EXACTLY what Oldschool SLAYER Fans have been waiting for!!! Although SLAYER's most recent releases were great albums -(Drummer:Paul Bostaph did an impressive job!) It just never for Me really captured the greatness that SLAYER once was.

B00006BSGZ|3.0|Callas only sings 4 arias on this dvd. This is the reason I gave only 3 stars. But sung of the finest possible voice, better than on other dvds availlable. The rest of it is Tosca complete act 2 and other orchestral pieces. She sings \\"Vissi d'arte\\", \\"Tu che le vanita\\" superbly, \\"Habanera\\" from Carmen and \\"Seguedille\\" of the same.

It has some details you miss in the mini series, and some background on some of the soldiers, which is nice. It is nicely written, entertaining, and really helps complete the Band of Brothers experience.
B00008F8HE|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer that this album is worth listening to. I was turned on to it (through the original vinyl version) in college and later found it on sale, hiding in an upstairs bargain rack at a Sears store of all places. Truly a diamond in the rough!\\"Mahavishnu\\" John McLaughlin and \\"Devadip\\" Carlos Santana do excellent work throughout, as does drummer Billy Cobham. The masterpiece Life Divine, with Santana's brilliant, echoplexed guitar work followed by McLaughlin's solo with scintillating final crescendo is worth the price of the album many times over alone. Once heard it won't be forgotten. It's too bad this CD is obviously out-of-print and somewhat pricey nowadays. It's a great album in my humble opinion.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I just picked this up. Wow! What a great album. Dave can still play the guitar, and his voice is still the same. But this album is so... not Pink Floyd it's scary. This is Dave at 60 (60!). In listening to it a few times, it's just great. It's so nice and mellow and melodic. It's so totally different from what I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised.  <br /> <br />I won't kid you all, I'm a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and most decidedly a bigger Gilmore fan than Waters. I was expecting something along the lines of AMLOR or the Division Bell, something contemporary art rock-ish. But this is so much better; this is Dave making music for the sake of making music. At this point in his career, he doesn't have anything left to prove; he didn't make this because he had to, he made it because he wanted to, and it's really all the difference. <br /> <br />I gave it 4 stars due to a couple \\"cheese tracks\\". Sorry Dave :D <br /> <br />Great album! Pick it up and decide for yourself. <br />(And if you're a big Floyd fan like me, be prepared for something different!)

0385509456|5.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a truly original book.  The plot centers around the life of fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone, who has autism and thrives on order.  When he discovers a neighbor's dog has been killed, impaled by a garden fork, Christopher is determined to solve the mystery of his death.  Yet while he begins looking into the mystery surrounding the dog, his own super-structured life starts to fall apart, and Christopher must learn how to survive outside of his comfort zone.<br /><br />Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this novel is the narration of Christopher.  As someone who is autistic, he cannot respond to the outside world in the manner that most people do.  He cannot feel necessarily, although he can fathom emotions, and he cannot understand the nuances that factor into everyday life.  The narration, therefore, is straightforward, with an honesty and intensity that is enthralling.  Readers want to know what is going to become of this fascinating character, even though the mystery that sets up the novel seems to be over half-way through the book.<br /><br />Mark Haddon has done a remarkable job at crafting a character who is interesting and vivid, but also by offering readers a chance to step into a world that most would not understand.  The writing shows great insight into what it is like to live with autism, especially in the passages where Christopher is overwhelmed by too much stimuli in the outside world.  \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a fast paced, funny, and poignant novel, that will make readers wonder at all the things they miss when they can't see everything.

B000002549|2.0|One does have to applaud Barbra for the effort, for showing that she really does care about music, not just her own.  Everyone knows about her forays into pop, rock and even disco.  Alas, while her voice is lovely, it seems more like an album of lullabies than classical lieder. She actually did a more authentic classical performance of a Schubert song on her TV special \\"Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments.\\"  Alas, this serious effort never comes close to showing the range of her voice that she played with in that 2 1/2 minute song.  A missed opportunity.
076531178X|5.0|I loved Elantris, and this one was just as good.  How does this guy keep coming up with these wonderful innovative halfway-to-science magic systems?  Jeez.  If all authors in the fantasy genre were as talented as Brandon Sanderson I'd have to give up any hope of ever joining their ranks.  As it is, he definitely belongs at the top of every list for fantasy writers and readers alike.  My only quibble:  He's got a few pet words and phrases (e.g., \\"a bit\\" \\"annoying\\") that got a bit annoying at times.  That's just my envy talking, though.  Wonderful story, great writing, highly recommended.

B000AL730O|5.0|If you like the Beatles, and very early McCartney, and you want to reminisce about life as we knew it back in the 60's and 70's, this is an album worth hearing! Not only is McCartney a proven musician, but as we always knew, a teacher and a positive voice in this new world of negative images and news stories. Put the CD in, turn off the lights, light some candles and some inscense and learn how to turn on your brain cells like you did in those \\"good ol days\\"! Remember those smile wrinkles?
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I saw John Mayer before he decided to go in the Blues direction.  All I could think was, \\"WoW, what a great guitar player\\".  I have heard all of his poppy stuff and he is good, but it is the musicianship I hear coming through the speakers. <br /> <br />I next heard him playing on the Eric Clapton-Crossroads DVD.  Wow, he is getting another few fans, brother, friends, me.  It took me awhile to pick this last CD up and I have no idea why I waited so long.  I love the sound, I think he has found his niche, but I know the pop sound will still be around.  BTW-I need to get this CD back from my brother.  One of those few CDs I can listen to anytime for any number of times in a row.  If you like Eric Clapton, his mentor, you will find him very enjoyable and he brings a new life to this genre and the old songs.  Can't wait to see where he takes his next turn.
6305754969|3.0|The mid-1960s was a point of intersection for American movies. It is a bit of a lost era and one of the lowest points in Hollywood's history. It is situated long after the peak glories of the `golden age' of Hollywood and just before the New Hollywood movement that would breathe such new and invigorating life into the ailing medium. In many ways the films from this era are the ones which new filmmakers would react so strongly against; movies high in budget but sparse in originality, cast with aging movie stars playing worn characters; bloated, lifeless, and out of touch with the rapidly changing social climate of the day. \\"El Dorado\\", released in 1967, is most assuredly a film of this era. It is a western of such a standard concept that it could have been made thirty years prior. Its stars, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, are well past their primes and here look stiff, heavy, and old. It is, like so many others of the time, a film that seems irrelevant and washed up; a product of `going through the motions.' Its one saving grace, however, is that it occasionally seems all too aware of this fact.<br /><br />I say that Wayne and Mitchum seem tired and old. This is no doubt due in part to their actual age, but it is also because they are playing characters who are tired and old. Mitchum plays J.P. Harrah, the drunken sheriff of El Dorado, and Wayne, Cole Thornton, a long time friend and aging gunslinger. The two shuffle and trudge though the film in a way we modern film spectators would love to call them out on, but which is intentional nearly to the point of inspired. Wayne especially, who at one point even needs help mounting his horse, seems more than aware of his changing role in films, and is obviously set about to age gracefully. He would go on to do this notion great justice in 1976's \\"The Shootist\\", but we can see the seeds of this self-reflexivity even here, some ten year prior. Mitchum too plays his role as a drunk with a certain amount of moxie, both recognizing and poking fun at his own reputation. The film is not a pure comedy, however, and despite their limitations, both the actors and characters do their best to prove they still have it, and do so to a degree of success. The scenes of hung-over Mitchum and half-paralyzed Wayne shooting their way through the streets of El Dorado determined to hold their own are quite exciting and enjoyable, and it is this aspect of the movie, this negotiation with age and character, that brings its greatest successes.<br /><br />But this does not save the film as a whole. Despite the apparent awareness of these actors that they are playing tired, worn characters, they are still playing tired, worn characters. And even if the characters have a certain added depth, both the direction and the screenplay certainly do not. The story is lifeless and dull, revolving around business disputes and questions of who is the fastest draw. Much of Wayne's dialogue, especially early in the film, sounds as if it were a compilation of dialogue from every other western he has made, and the movie as a whole feels as though it must have seemed badly dated even at the time of its release. Howard Hawks, that old master of the Hollywood western, tries to bring new life to the film though the quirky character of Mississippi, played by a young James Caan, and through some intentionally odd humour, but these attempts to be `hip' cannot help but feel heavy-handed and false, like a middle age man trying to seem `cool' for the kids. There are hints that Hawks could see a future for Westerns, particularly through this humour which seems somewhat a precursor to Leone and the spaghetti westerns, but for the most part he comes across as what he is: an ageing director trying, but ultimately failing, to make films the way he always has and yet keep current.<br /><br />One need only put this movie into context to see its awkward place in cinematic history. It comes some ten years after the western peaked with \\"The Searchers\\" (1956) and some eight years after Hawks' own \\"Rio Bravo\\" (1959), which also starred Wayne and Mitchum, and was already a look back to the past glories of the genre. Two years after \\"El Dorado\\" Wayne starred in the painfully out of touch \\"The Green Berets\\" (1968), a film that would solidify Wayne's position outside of contemporary culture. Westerns themselves would soon be turned upside down and shaken by Sam Peckinpah and other young filmmakers who would more competently play with the conventions of the genre. But here is \\"El Dorado\\", firmly within the middle: a film aware enough of its own age to be interesting, but lacking enough ambition or energy to solve this dilemma. Some of it is quite enjoyable, and Wayne and Mitchum are often great to watch, but ultimately the film is as awkward and stiff as the many other films of its era.e Searchers\\" (1956) and some eight years after Hawks' own \\"Rio Bravo\\" (1959), which also starred Wayne and Mitchum, and was already a look back to the past glories of the genre.

B000A3DFZE|3.0|Clapton's return to the middle of the road finds that the road he remembers from his '80s career as a radio hitmaker has pretty much dissapeared.  Sounding like a relic of the late-'80s (right down to the Steve Gadd drums and Steve Winwood-sounding lead synths), this is teflon music - so slick that it won't stick to anything, particularly your ears.      Something of a minor concept album, centered around the themes of family and, well, home, the disc does have moments when the production backs off and real feeling shines through, particularly in the acoustic title track and the bittersweet kids-grow-up ballad \\"Run Home to Me\\".  There are also plenty of misses and a few real embarassments here - particularly the stilted faux reggae of \\"Revolution\\" -- this is the guy who hit with \\"I Shot the Sherriff\\"? -- and the tired call-and-response of \\"I'm Going Left\\".      Fans of Clapton the singer more than Clapton the player may want to give it a try, as he is in fine voice throughout, though his guitar playing is often subdued and noodly.  Several tracks benefit greatly from the warm presence of Billy Preston's Hammond organ (in one of Preston's last studio credits).
1591391105|4.0|Watkins' success with this book is in my view based on the simplicity, clarity, and sensible structure of his model.  The model and supporting tools and concepts may or may not be grounded in behavioral science or perhaps even in extensive research that would pass muster with the sternest of psychometricians, but no matter - they'll work if you apply them with rigor and flexibility. <br /> <br />That's the thing about leadership books and leadership itself, isn't it?  If you can wade through the many paradoxes presented by the rigorous yet flexible application of common sense, you'll probably come out on top.   <br /> <br />Watkins' work here is awfully strong.  This book is highly readable, easily digestible, and provides simple, easy mental models for new leaders to latch on to.  I recommend this book strongly to all the newly-promoted and newly-hired managers I encounter, just as it was recommended to me.  That's probably the best endorsement possible.

1931559317|5.0|There are two small atlases I consider to be absolutely indispensable.  Sky and Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas is one of them.  The charts in this atlas were well chosen.  Each covers just the right amount of sky to give both a good perspective of the area you are looking at, and enough detail for star hopping with binoculars or finder scope, (stars are shown down to magnitude 7.6).  Stick figures highlight the constellations to provide an easy and intuitive reference for what part of the sky the chart covers.  An all sky view key of the charts is provided at the back of the book so that charts are easily located.  The charts are well organized and very easy to navigate.    The charts are printed in color and are works of art in their own right.  Not only is the atlas useful in the field, but it is a pleasure to browse through anytime.    The construction of the atlas is also very well done.  It is spiral bound so that the charts open flat, making them easy to view.  The charts are printed on good quality paper that looks as though it will stand up well even on nights when dew is challenging your ability to view.    Although it may seem like a small thing, a nice feature of the Atlas is a scale on the front cover from which one can construct a set of circles based on the field of view of each instrument you observe with.  There is even a template showing the circles of a Telrad finder.  It would have been even better if a clear plastic template with field of view circles had already been included, but it was easy enough to create my own set of circles.    Overall, this is an outstanding atlas for taking into the field, and I would certainly recommend it.  As I said, I consider it to be indispensable; however, unlike others, I do not consider it to be the only quality pocket atlas out there.  Another outstanding atlas is The Observer's Sky Atlas by E. Karkoschka.  It is a nice compliment to Sky & Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas.  I like the Pocket Sky Atlas for its big broad views of the sky and it's stunning charts.  I like the Observer's Sky Atlas because it has some additional detail (see my review of that book) not available in the Pocket Sky Atlas.  Both are ideal as field atlases, and I keep them both very close at hand when I've observing.      I hope you're not in a position where you can only buy one.  Choosing between the two would be difficult.  As I said, I keep both with me when I'm observing.  But if you do have to choose, I would suggest the following.  If you want the nicest looking atlas, go with the Pocket Sky Atlas.  If you want a bit more detail and you don't mind giving up the glossy color pages and spiral binding, go with the Observers's Sky Atlas.  But honestly, you really can't go wrong with either one.
0385338082|5.0|This review is for the Dell mass market paperback edition, January 2006, 374 pages.  CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET was on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list for 34 weeks between March 2004 and January 2006, reaching a peak position of number twenty-five.<br /><br />On a short but turbulent, white-knuckle flight from Glasgow to London, Emma Corrigan, with her tongue loosened by three vodka tonics and champagne, blabs her secrets to the handsome guy sitting by her side.  She admits surreptitiously substituting her Mum's goldfish after having killed the original, reveals why her G-string is two sizes too small, and that she cheated on the application for her job at Panther Corporation - and much, much more.  Then, when Emma goes to work the following Monday, she discovers the seatmate to whom she has confessed all is Jack Harper, the CEO of Panther Corporation who is in town to inspect the UK subsidiary.  As the predictable romance evolves, Emma gets strung out on a tight rope of anxiety and embarrassment as Jack meets the subjects of her secrets, and he quite rudely remembers every one of them.<br /><br />CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET is non-stop funny with spiffy dialogue and a full cast of believable, almost familiar, characters.  From the pink cover to the last word, this is chick-lit romance at its best.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I have to admit that when I first heard Supermassive Black Hole, I was stunned. The rumor going around was that the boys had been spending a lot of time in clubs, and wanted to do something a bit more upbeat and danceable - which I'm all for - but an exploration into a style similar to Prince had me concerned.<br /><br />And then I heard the entire album....and Black Holes and Revelations quickly displaced Absolution as #2 in my favorite Muse album ranking (behind Origin of Symmetry, of course).<br /><br />WOW. A fantastic album! Just amazing. Yes, it's a bit more glib and synthetic and hollywood, but it just flat out rocks. Standouts for me include 'Starlight,' from which the album title comes, the enigmatic (even if it is Prince-esque) 'Supermassive Black Hole,' the very new wave (think 1986 Wire) 'Map of the Problematique,' the hard-edged 'Assassin,' and of course the futuristic, mystical 'Knights Of Cydonia,' which borrows heavily from Queen.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|For those of us who have seen the stage production or listened obsessively to the Phantom soundtrack, this movie does not disappoint.  Yes, it has more than one campy moment (from Minnie Driver/Carlotta's over-the-top wig (very bad pun intended) and dress descending from the stage's ceiling to the serendipitous horse transporting the Phantom and Christine to the bowels of the Paris Opera Populaire--in real life, I don't think a horse could survive underground for very long without its hooves rotting), but even those moments have become endearing.  Though if truth be told, my friends and I laughed our heads off in the movie theatre during those two scenes.<br /><br />A darker and very painful part of the movie was the look into the Phantom's childhood.  I have to fast-forward this scene, or I'll start crying.  Miranda Richardson's character took pity upon the abused child, yet had no idea as a young girl that this deformed autodidact would grown up to haunt the opera house.  (In the special features disc, the director joked that Miranda Richardson interviewed him for the job, not the other way around, to see if this project was a worthwhile investment of her energy and talents.)<br /><br />The actor who played Raoul was brilliant as was newcomer, Emmy Rossum. People have insulted Gerard Butler's performance and compared it negatively against the standard of Michael Crawford's Phantom.  I think that Gerard's acting was very good, and I really empathized with his character's plight.  His singing was amazingly good for an amateur who had only just begun voice lessons after he won the coveted role. I challenge any critic to perform as well under those circumstances. (However, I will admit that I'm surprised that an amateur was cast for this role.)<br /><br />The scenery was lush, the costumes luxurious, and the music--yes, overplayed, but nonetheless--gorgeous; no expense was spared for this production. The director said that this movie as-to-date is the most expensive and lavishly produced Independent Film.  I really wish that movie producers would get the ball rolling and put Lucy Simon's \\"The Secret Garden\\" on the Silver Screen.  Rebecca Luker could retain her role as Lily in an on-screen production.  Just a suggestion for \\"The Really Useful\\" Film/Scion Films Production Company.d Independent Film.

B0000084J7|5.0|I don't think there is much to say about this album other than it is simply beautiful. While it will never achieve any level of commercial success - who cares? This is yet another album for fans of the breathy yet nasal, eclectic and hauting voice of Mark Hollis. If you followed the course of the Talk Talk albums as they moved further and further outside of the mainstream, you'd have to agree that this album fits right in as the next link in the chain. Love it.
B00009W8N2|3.0|Opeth's first album runs along the lines of Supertramp's first effort.  Not musically, but in the sense that they were a band still sorting themselves out with a lineup that wouldn't make the final cut. As for the music itself, parts of Orchid are brilliant, but they're overshadowed by long moody stretches that seem more like exercises than constructive compositions. All of this would change in future albums of course.  With subsequent growth in song writing and bringing the phenomenal rhythm section of Martin Lopez and Martin Mendez on board, Opeth found their potential and continue to explore its limits.  If you're looking for a proper introduction to Opeth, Blackwater Park is the album to start with.  Eventually it will lead you back here, but then you'll be able to appreciate Orchid's finer points.  On a side note, the bonus track, Into the Frost of Winter, is of marginal interest and the poor recording quality detracts from the rest of the album.  It would have been better off in a collection of rarities/oddities for the faithful.
0060989157|5.0|What an exciting read! I knew very little about the band, but the book was highly recommended by a friend so I gave it a chance. After a couple chapters I was hooked. I feel I know more about any band than I want, but I like it. <br /> <br />This book feels real. It's entertaining, education, fun, and laugh at loud funny at times.

This book seems to me like a nineteenth-century version of The Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives...so if that is what you're looking for, you'll thoroughly enjoy this book; however, if you want a real love story, look into Jane Austen, for instance.<br /><br />I will admit that I saw the Reese Witherspoon movie version of this book before I ever read it...and as usual, was much more impressed with the book, and more surprised than I thought I would be at how much they truly deviated from the novel with that particular movie version.
B000BB14YY|5.0|I've watched many Japanese movies and have never 'felt' them until I watched \\"Ran\\". Powerful, 'Dark', you can almost guess what's going to happen but it still comes at you and makes it all the harder to bear.

B000E97HIA|5.0|Finally, generation X has its first real bite of Purple Rock. This album is both infectious and incredible. I haven't stopped playing it for over two weeks in my car. The most powerful songs are Fury, Love, and Beautiful, Loved, & Blessed. Also, Get on the Boat takes you on a James Brown influenced journey like no other. Most songs are laced with biblical references recorded over hypnotic dance grooves and beats. The character of the album is very well delivered. The lyrics are both hopeful and spiritual. This cd is the best Prince has offered since the mid-90s.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|Yesterday. I enter Circuit City at Union Square in NYC with my wife, who is from Japan, and this DVD is on three modestly sized plasma TVs a the top of the escalator--which is crowded with mesmorized viewers.<br /><br />We could not help it.  The show was so awesome that we found ourselves standing there, entranced.<br /><br />My wife put it correctly when she said to me in Japanese, \\"Whatever he does in life, people will always be facinated with his performances,\\" meaning no matter what freakish things he does to or with his body, it just plain wont effect the fact that he truly is the King of Pop (though I must then appoint Prince as the Emperor of Pop--sorry Michael).<br /><br />That really summed it up; we were watching one of the all time great masters of performance, and indeed were lucky to be alive when his career was in full swing.<br /><br />Michael Jackson is one of the all time greats--like Harry Houdini, Fred Astaire, Jimmy Hendrix, or Miles Davis.  He's a master of the stage, and--though I protest with myself--has a fantastic musical ability that can't help but mesmorize.<br /><br />On this DVD, there is of course a lot of lip synching.  This isn't so much a music concert as a stage show.  And as a stage show, it's one of the greatest of all time.  Just seeing Jackson dance to his own music is worth your money.<br /><br />*****There was one musical break that was facinating, though it wasn't performed by Jackson.  At one point in the performance, he shares the stage with a solo guitarist--apparrently just for effect--but the guitarist completely takes over the stage.  Jackson points him out to a stage hand, who tries to stop the solo, and the guitarist just keeps going with a fantastic, mad, crazy solo.<br /><br />It's pretty rare to see a solo like that unless you're in the biz.  I immediately thought of Mike Stern--who this was not--totally dominating the show.  Jackson should have let him go a bit longer, but instead started the next bit and had the guitarist's plug pulled.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I suppose that says a lot about Jackson's way of performing--he's a perfectionist; it's all planned out, and it follows the plan exactly.  Other performers would have played counterpoint to that solo (as the guitarist was starting to do when Jackson 'interrupted), shared the limelight, and acknowledged that this is what musical performance is really all about--that there's really no such thing as a solo artist, unless of course you're Michael Jackson.<br /><br />Anyway, I can't help but give this DVD 5 stars on sheer greatness.ose that says a lot about Jackson's way of performing--he's a perfectionist; it's all planned out, and it follows the plan exactly.

B000GTLQXU|4.0|I had a really good time watching this action packed adventure. Every moment once the ship was hit by the wave was a moment of seat edged excitement. The actors all do a superb job! I say that because alot of them performed their own stunts. These were not easy stunts either however, director Wolfgang Petersen requested that the actors do any stunts that they felt ok with doing.. and you really notice them doing alot of dangerous ones. For instance one of our lead actresses goes sliding down a cluttered hallway with gallons of water as the ship begins to tilt (not the first tilt). Also actor Josh Lucas really swims in water under a humongous layer of fire! Plus all the actors spent more time under water than any human is supposed to. Bravo once again to the cast. Now for the sets. Absolutely stunning and worth an Academy Award!! The sets are remarkable in every scene.. truly no lack of detail. \\"Poseidon\\" is an action packed crowd pleaser with great attention to detail. Okay, now to explain my title. If you have seen the film \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" you know this isnt really a remake. This film more less only takes the same idea and runs with it. All new characters to root for and a completely different script.. dont expect the Shelley Winters character to pop up in this one. The only thing that is the same with both movies is, ..a ship (called the Poseidon) is hit by a massive wave that turns it over on New Years. Enjoy! Here are some other films by this director. \\"Air Force One\\", \\"Das Boot\\", \\"In the Line of Fire\\", \\"Outbreak\\", \\"The Perfect Storm\\" (and), \\"Troy\\".

Ever since (even after I was allowed to watch actual scary halloween movies) this has been my very favorite movie to put in the DVD player, pop some popcorn and have fun. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a movie to laugh all the way through or something to watch with the kids I suggest you pick up a copy of this movie. You won't regret it!

Frankly you don't, you just watch it and enjoy. <br /> <br />The plot of this picture takes quite a few twists and turns, you never really know where it is going until the very end.   <br /> <br />The writing is simply awesome, and Chow is at the top of his game but it is Qiu Yuen far removed from her days as a kung-fu teenager in the Man with the Golden Gun who makes this film. <br /> <br />The knife throwing scene is worth the price of the film alone.
B00005JMUA|5.0|In this day and age when sequels like `Matrix Reloaded' and such pollute our cinemas and ruin the glory of their predecessors I am pleased to have found a sequel worthy of its name.  `Kill Bill Vol. 2' is really less a sequel and more a continuation, but call it what you may, it still works. <br /> <br />Picking up where `Vol. 1' left off we have The Bride (Thurman) exacting her revenge against the men and women that killed her friends and family, but there's a twist.  The unborn child she thought was murdered was in fact preserved.  The question remains that will her child with Bill change her plans to kill him?   <br /> <br />Filled with brilliant acting on all counts, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine reprising their roles as Elle and Bill, each of them doing brilliantly to bring the right amount of emotion and character to their roles, this movie is raised from action blockbuster status to Oscar caliber.  My favorite performance though is from Michael Madsen who plays Budd; a man who knows what they've done is wrong but isn't prepared to die for it. <br /> <br />This film is somewhat slower than the first and focuses more on The Bride's emotional battles than her physical ones.  That doesn't by any means take away from the enjoyment received from watching this masterpiece.  A perfect companion to the first film, Tarantino and Thurman deliver a great film that will be remembered as classic for a long time to come.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|After reading countless reviews about these Star Wars DVD's over the past few months here on Amazon from some who are taking this issue way too seriously to others who just don't seem to have a clue as to what some words mean, I finally feel compelled enough to write a review of my own.    To begin, I agree with the majority of reviewers in the fact that these films, the original unaltered Star Wars trilogy, deserve much better treatment for release on DVD.  Now, from what I understand, the original negatives/prints were destroyed or altered during the restoration for the Special Edition release back in 1997 and, as a result, can't be restored.  Therefore, the laserdisc transfers from 1993 are being used as source material for the upcoming DVD release, which explains why these \\"bonus\\" DVD's (don't get me started on the originals only being - according to the soulless marketing geniuses at LucasFilm - \\"bonus\\" discs),  won't be anamorphic and without 5.1 surround sound.  I also understand that LucasFilm is not willing to put in as much time, effort, or money into this project since the original unaltered films didn't represent his true \\"vision\\" for the films.  However, I take issue with the reasoning behind this thought process.    First of all, I'll admit I'm no film restoration expert, but common sense would tell me that 95% of the restoration of the original unaltered trilogy has already been done since only, at the very most, 5% of the original movies was altered for the Special Edition releases.  And if all the negatives from the originals were, in fact, destroyed (which I highly doubt unless George Lucas cut them up and set them ablaze late one night during a fit of artistic rage), all one would have to do is find some copied negatives/prints that were used in the theaters when the movies originally came out (perhaps from a private collector if LucasFilm doesn't have any which, again, I highly doubt) and restore just the 5% of scenes that were changed or removedcompletely from the newer versions with better picture quality and 5.1 surround sound instead of re-restoring the entire original movies.  As a result, the excuse of not wanting to put the time, effort, and money into this project doesn't really make much sense since they would only have to restore just a few scenes here and there, even if those scenes weren't taken from the original negatives.  Also, keep in mind these are the same people behind THX, so LucasFilm releasing a half-hearted attempt of a DVD release is hypocritical of a company who prides itself on industry-setting high-standard video and audio quality.    As for the \\"anamorphic\\" situation, I think the meaning of the word \\"anamorphic\\" first needs to be explained.  In simplest terms, a DVD in anamorphic widescreen format means the video contained in the DVD will take up the entire screen on a widescreen TV without having to zoom in and, in turn, no black letterbox bars will show (at least they won't if the movie was shot in 16:9 widescreen; Star Wars, on the other hand, was shot in \\"extra-widescreen\\" so the black letterbox bars will still appear on the top and bottom of a 16:9 widescreen TV, but roughly only half as much as they would on a standard 4:3 TV - the image will still fill the screen from side-to-side).  Now, if you don't own a widescreen TV, this isn't a major issue since you will see the letterbox bars regardless if you're watching a widescreen-version DVD on a standard 4:3 TV.  However, if you're like me and do happen to own a widescreen TV, there is nothing more frustrating than buying a DVD only to find out it isn't anamorphic when you start to play it, which defeats the whole purpose of owning a widescreen TV if the DVD you'd like to watch will not only show the letterbox bars on top, but on the sides as well.  And zooming in to enlarge the picture and rid the bars doesn't help much either because whenever you zoom in on something, whether it be a DVD or a picture on a computer, you lose picture quality which again defeats the purpose of a owning a DVD in the first place.  So for you reviewers out there who think some people are overreacting because these DVD's won't be anamorphic, you obviously don't own a widescreen TV and don't know what words mean.    Now for the fans who are taking this situation way too seriously, just take a deep breath and relax.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as big a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, especially \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", as much as anyone and would like to see the original movies get the proper respect and treatment they deserve (even if only for preservation's sake).  But keep in mind these are just movies meant to entertain - not cure the world of cancer.  And even if the new computer-generated footage added in the Special Edition versions already released on DVD takes away from the original trilogy (which it does, especially that new Max Rebo Band song in Return of the Jedi - who was the genius that came up with that?) they are, like I mentioned, practically 95% visually the same and 99.9% the same story-wise as the originals and are anamorphic with 5.1 surround sound.  And if not having Han shooting first or having the original \\"Star Wars\\" opening crawl from '77 makes you lay awake at night (the addition of \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\" actually does improve the film from a storyline standpoint if you think about), I truly do feel sorry for you (even though I agree Han should be shooting first, which accounts for that extra 0.1%).    I could also get into how the original trilogy, even the Special Editions, is far superior to the blue screen-themed new trilogy by leaps and bounds (keep in mind George Lucas didn't write or direct \\"Empire\\" or \\"Jedi\\" and wasn't surrounded by \\"yes men\\" back then), but then I'd really ramble on and this review would be five times longer than it already is now.    Hopefully, one day in a galaxy far, far away (boy was that clever), George Lucas will put his ego aside, or at least follow a masterful yet soulless marketing plan, and give the cinematically-outstanding originals he created the proper respect and DVD treatment they deserve.  But until then, I (along with almost every other reviewer here on Amazon - admit it) will probably end up buying these half-hearted DVD's just so I can say I've got the originals on DVD, even though these DVD's will probably only be slightly better than the widescreen VHS tapes I bought back in '95.  In the meantime, though, I'll have to admit it is kind of entertaining to watch the real-life transformation of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader back to Anakin Skywalker in the form of one George Lucas.        Note:  According to \\"The Rumor Mill\\" over at The Digital Bits website from 8/24/2006, it has been confirmed that LucasFilm will be releasing an \\"ultimate, 6-film Star Wars anniversary boxed set planned for 2007\\" with even more changes to the films (supposedly one change is the puppet Yoda from Episode I is now going to be a CG version like what was used in Episodes II and III), as well as more special features and deleted scenes.  It is unknown if restored versions of the original trilogy will be included, but keep this in mind if you plan to purchase these DVD's.
B000051VWW|5.0|It seems like Sade blesses us with her melodic stylings every 8 years or so, but her music is always memorable, and touches the deepest confines of my emotions and soul (it's definately not pop music). <br /> <br />I had the pleasure of seeing Sade live at Jones Beach years ago, she performs barefoot and appeared to be in her natural element on the beach, this all made the experience all the more sensuous, my date and I loved it. That whole night seemed on the verge of a major downpour, and this venue has no rain cover, needless to say this enchantingly beautiful lady and her music, kept the inclimate weather at bay, all night long, just providing a cool mist to keep us refreshed. <br /> <br />I guess Sade has been catogorized as a contemporary jazz artist but her music transcends normal parameters of classification. I put this CD on when I need spiritual healing. I just kick back with the headphones in effect and listen to track 7 \\"The Sweetest Gift\\" (dedicated to her child) and track 11 \\"It's Only Love That Gets You Through\\" over and over and over again. Track 1 \\"By Your Side\\" was the first song released after an excruciating long hiatus (8yrs), it was a hit immediately. I hope and pray that we don't have to wait much longer for this true musical angel's, return.

A number of massive space ships orbitng the solar system have been outfitted with huge geodesic domes in which forests complete with plants, vegetables and animals flourish.  Dern portrays Freeman Lowell a passionate conservationist and caretaker of these domes.<br /><br />When orders come from Earth to inexplicably destroy the domes and the precious forests Dern is shattered.  After failing to convince his three fellow crew members to ignore the orders,  he decides to dispatch them all to protect his special project.<br /><br />Hurtling through space with only three waddling robotic drones as company, Dern attempts to cope with the solitude while tending to the domes.  He receives a communication from Earth that his ship is approaching the rings of Saturn possibly too distant for a recovery.  His thought of being marooned does not disturb him but things change when the forests start slowly dying.<br /><br />\\"Silent Running\\" while based on a science fiction premise complete with nice special effects is by no means a sci fi flick.  It is a conflict between a man, ardent in his beliefs and an apathetic society.
B000002JSP|5.0|...with the automatic fire alarm exit!  First off, lets be real honest, punk wasn't that big of a problem in the late 1970's, sure in England it was everywhere, but here in the US Arena rock still had at least 70% of the mainstream music scene.  How many punk albums have sold over 10 million?  Very very few, at the same time the so-called \\"punk explosion\\" happened in 1975-1982, at least 11 hard rock bands released albums that sold in excess of 15 million each, so much for the \\"music of rebellion\\"!  In fact the only Punk album ever to reach the infamous 10 million sold mark was \\"Dookie\\" by Green Day, so punk's impact is very overated.  The only reason why people hype up punk music like it was the huge music scene during the late 70's is because they won't admit that it was in fact the heavy metal scene that came into dominance, because anybody who reads Rolling Stones is an extremely anti-metal music fan and they will use any excuse to dismiss the impact of Van Halen, Judas Priest, Ac/Dc, Aerosmith, and Kiss during the latter part of the 70's.<br /><br />Not that In Through the Outdoor faced an actual threat, Led Zeppelin just thought of a very creative album name with no reason behind it and just to be nice and make retarded musicians like the Sex Pistols and the Clash feel special said they named the album that \\"because the awful noise of the punk scene was too loud for anyone to hear good music.\\"  In fact, the existence of heavy metal music at this time made it easier for Led Zeppelin to 'get through the indoor', so to speak.<br /><br />This album is very underated.  Many casual fans diss this album to death while diehards pratically disown this album.  I understand it is a bit synth heavy at times, but that is because the band were experimenting with a new sound.  If you find this experimentation too weird, then I'm surprised you bought \\"Houses of the Holy\\" and \\"Physical Graffiti\\" which are easily some of the most experimental albums of all time.  Instead this album as it really is: John Paul Jones' baby, a very unique musical direction that is influenced by Jones' wide instrumental background instead of Jimmi Page's experiences while stoned out of his mind.  Besides Jones' songwriting credits, the best songwriting came from Plant, who wrote on all seven of the album's tracks.  I daresay that this is some of his most emotional lyric work, as he just recovered from the death of his son.<br /><br />track listing:<br /><br />1.In the Evening (6:49): The best song on here and one of Led Zeppelin's all-time best.  It is my personal favorite, Jimmi's riffs on here are amazing, it sounds like he plays a series of notes then distorts the last to create an echo effect.  Def Leppard stole this riff for \\"Foolin'\\" and \\"Rock of Ages\\", just in case you are wondering where they got the \\"Zeppelin\\" influence.<br /><br />2.South Bound Saurez (4:17): Melloton heavy track with a jazzy vocal work by Plant.  I don't really remember how this song went, just that it was pretty cool.<br /><br />3.Fool in the Rain (6:12): The other hard rocker on this album, with a lot of synth work.  Has a very latin feel to it and you can hear Page's distinct 'blue box' guitar synthesizer, which has a pretty cool noise to it.<br /><br />4.Hot Dog (3:17): The shortest song on here; I recall it being kind of a rocker with a pretty good guitar solo.<br /><br />5.Carouselramba (10:32): Sounds like carousel music!  This is the highlight of Jones' synthesizer work as it dominates the background over his already played bass part.  I am a little disappointed with the guitar sound, you can barely hear Jimmi Page until later in the song where he uses his infamous double-neck guitar.  The last part of the song is the best where everybody has an allout jam so as to give a festive sound.<br /><br />6.All My Love (5:53): A truely sad song written by Robert Plant for his dead son Karac.  Highlight is Jones' synthesizer solo and Plant's emotional vocals.<br /><br />7.I'm Gonna Crawl (5:30): A return to the blues-roots but a very awkward way to close the album up.  It is a love song which John Bonham noted as one of Robert Plant's best vocal performances.lues-roots but a very awkward way to close the album up.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Just as it was inevitable that Doctor Who was finally scrapped in 1989, after a long and agonizing death spanning almost a decade, it was equally so that one day it would be revived. The format was just too flexible, exciting and productive for any TV executive to ignore for ever and finally in 2005, after one abortive attempt to get the series back on track in 1996, the Time Lord returned to BBC TV with a bang. And what a bang! Under the guidance of Russell T. Davies, one of British TV's leading creative forces, the famous show has undergone a transformation and revitalization that has made into the most successful drama of the past year. <br /> <br />One of the problems facing any production team charged with reinventing Doctor Who was its long and distinguished history. Tampering with such an iconic format too much would be in danger of subverting the brand, but producing it in the same style and limitations of its earlier incarnations would have been a recipe of disaster. Davies and his team and have surpassed all expectations and relaunched the show for a whole new generation, while successfully maintaining all of the elements that make Doctor Who, Doctor Who! The Daleks are back, but are now more convincing and mennacing than ever before. The alien mystery of the Doctor is explored and the companion is seen to have a life outside of the TARDIS walls that gives the show an edge of reality it always lacked before. <br /> <br />The first season of 13 forty-five minute episodes is now available on DVD, with a welter of extras and goodies spanning five discs in an impressive TARDIS designed box set. There is a commentary for every episode from numerous members of the production team and at least one member of the cast from each story. Alas, The Doctor himself, Christopher Eccleston does not appear, but you will find his assistant Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) popping up, as well as the two part-time companions Adam and Jack (played by Bruno Langley and John Barrowman) making contributions. Eccleston's dominant portrayal of the 900 years old Time Lord was pivotal to the successful revival of the show and it's such a shame that he severed his ties with the program so abruptly and quickly. Although it has to be said that his replacement, David Tennant is also wonderful in the role.  There are 12 accompanying behind-the-scenes mini-documentaries for each episode, although sadly, these are only 50% of what was broadcast on the BBC at the time of the episode's first airing. All of the material relating to the classic series that was included has been dropped from the DVD. There are wonderful behind the scenes looks at the amazing special effects, graphics, design etc., and some interviews with the cast and crew.  <br /> <br />Fans of the classic series have nothing to fear in this new version. It's different Doctor Who for sure, but it's a new vision of the format that works wonderfully. If only we could pretend that the 1996 TV movie with Paul McGann never happened, or indeed we could wipe out the dying years of the original series with Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy. This is Doctor Who back at its very best and this set will keep you riveted for hours of entertainment.
1577312082|5.0|First, let me say that the audio CD's convey Eckhart Tolle's message more clearly and personally in his own words better than the book can. The information conveyed, although sounding easy- stilling the mind & being in the NOW (as opposed to the past and future thinking)is not easy to achieve and requires practice and repitition (which the audio CD's provide). <br /> <br />Secondly, the book and CD's are helpful to advanced humanity who have already achieved mental and personality development (most people have not) and also presupposes that there is some spiritual development from previous lives and are now discontent with the mind/personality and materialism of the three lower worlds (physical, emotional and mental)to serve as a catalyst in the transformation/spiritual advancement. This is the same error people make when learning Buddhism (no mind) which is for advanced souls to fully undertake to be of value and most people on the spiritual path should start with spirituality meditations such as Bhakti yoga(devotional/emotional plane after achieving the physical plane discipline of Hatha yoga and before attempting the mental plane discipline of Raja yoga or Buddhism or the \\"Power of Now\\"). <br /> <br />We are all evolving (at different levels) on the spiritual path and should know where we stand on it to continue our development- first in the three worlds of mental and personality development (we all have developed physical and emotional bodies) and then in the spiritual realm of transmuting the lower into the higher (the spiritual initiations achieved through effort, time and different spiritual meditations/practices to hasten them). The womb recapitulates the previous stages of mankind (fish, amphibious, reptilian, etc.) and the then we recapitulate our development from previous lives when we are born(physical, emotional and then mental and finally personality which integrates the lower three if we have achieved that in previous lives and evolved to that point).Finally, the spiritual stages are recapitulated (usually beginning in our 30's if we have advanced/evolved that far previously and are ready to pick up where we left off). We can then hasten our spiritual development by undertaking a more rigorous campaign of meditations, learning spiritually etc. at that point. <br />

From 'No Woman no Cry' ,'I shot the Sheriff' to 'One Love', this is a great listen. One of the things about Bob Marley was that he merged alot of emotional effort into his songs.

B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I picked this up on a whim, I had heard only the first single off the CD (\\"Ready to Fall\\"). Usually never buy a CD until hearing multiple songs, but I took a chance and was rewarded. I thought Rise Against's previous CDs were okay (I liked \\"Revolutions Per Minute\\"'s punk better than \\"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\\"'s hardcore) but this CD is really great. It's what I might deem intelligent punk; that is, punk that is a bit more thoughtful than the usual 3-chord stuff, but it's no less effective, energetic or enjoyable to listen to. The singer's voice is not whiny like so many other bands today. (I listened to Rise Against and AFI back-to-back, I like both bands but the difference is extremely noticable!) Favorite songs: Prayer of the Refugee, Good Left Undone, Roadside, Ready to Fall, Under the Knife. Note that you probably won't get the full impact of these songs from a 30-second clip, you'd have to listen to the whole songs to appreciate 'em.

It shows many deleted scenes including one visual alternate ending and one scripted alternate ending.

B00005JOML|4.0|I didn't expect much coming into the movie, but was pleasantly surprised to see how well Micahel Mann remade his intrepid duo, creating quite a different look and feel from the original series.  Gone were the bright lights, deco colors and leisure jackets of the 80's.  This was a decidedly more serious look at the world of crime that hits Miami like a tidal wave during peak crime season.  However, Miami was less the focus than the fallout zone of this crime wave, as most of the action takes place in South American and Carribean locales like Haiti, Cuba and Paraguay.<br /><br />Crockett and Tubbs go by Sonny and Rico in this movie.  There isn't much non-chalance in Sonny's demeanor, as portrayed by Colin Farrell, who takes the lead in this movie.  Jamie Foxx looks buff and very much in control as Rico, able to inspire much more confidence in the character than had Philip Michael Thomas.  The Vice squad looks more like a SWAT team with their heavy arsenal and sophisticated surveillance equipment, as they take over where the FBI had failed in busting up an international drugs and arms cartel that stretches from South American to Russia.<br /><br />Li Gong plays a Chinese-Cuban who is at the center of the cartel, which Sonny and Rico hope to break open.  Always sensuous, Li Gong comes across as a soft target in this movie, as Sonny gets deeper and deeper into the mob activities. Jamie Foxx plays things closer to home in his love interest, Naomie Harris, who is part of the vice squad.<br /><br />The movie is very intimate in its cinematography, shot mostly in the dark or in grainy daylight and interior settings.  I don't think the sun shone once in this movie, as there always seemed to be a dark cloud floating overhead, with the flashing of lightning and crackle of thunder.  It was more similar to Mann's Heat than it was his original television series.  So, those expecting to see something of that 80's feel will be disappointed.  But, it is well done if a bit too earnest in its approach.  Just once I would have liked to see these guys crack a smile.ust once I would have liked to see these guys crack a smile.

B00005JKJA|5.0|I'm not sure I buy the literal interpretations of the movie above.  Lynch was never one to let you in on all his secrets, and this movie proves every bit as elusive as any of his films.  One does get the sense this is a dream within a dream, a la Edgar Allen Poe, as reality becomes subjective in this movie.  Lynch seemed to relish toying with the idea of a Hollywood starlet, played to perfection by Naomi Watts in what has to be her standout performance.  She covers virtually the full range of emotions in her character(s).  But, if you are looking for any clear resolution to the movie you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The majority of the film plays out in linear fashion, a bit too comfortably, as the darker elements seep into various scenes.  One patiently waits for the walls to cave in and when they do, they do so in such a devastating manner that one is really hit by the severity of the film, especially as played out by Naomi Watts.  Whereas her emotions were much more tightly controlled in the body of the movie, they are deeply visceral in the concluding segment, which does lead one to assume that it is all too real what is now happening.<br /><br />However, I get the feeling that dream and reality overlap between the two segments, and that one can reassemble the pieces in any number of ways.  Whatever the case, the movie is mesmerizing to watch, both in Naomi Watts brilliant performance, and Lynch's marvelous command of this fractured cinematic fairy tale.
0452270073|4.0|Pat Barker's novel \\"Regeneration\\" follows soldiers, some based on real poets, who have been admitted into the Craiglockhart War Hospital for treatment of \\"war neurosis\\" during WWI.  Through the patients and their doctor (Rivers), Barker analyzes the toll the war took on the generation of men who fought in it.   <br /> <br />The novel opens with an anti-war declaration written by Siegfried Sassoon, a new patient at the hospital who is angry with the government because he believes there is no point to the war.  Rivers's job is to make patients like Sassoon fit to return to the fighting, but the mental conditions of some of the men makes him question the war's motives just as Sassoon does.      <br /> <br />In my opinion, one of the strongest sections of the novel is towards the end when Rivers goes to sit in on a treatment session led by another doctor, Yealland, who uses electroshock treatment on his patients. Rivers compares himself to Yealland, and is overcome with guilt for how he controls his own patients.  <br /> <br />I had never read a novel set during WWI, so I didn't have anything to compare \\"Regeneration\\" with when I started reading it.  I was quite surprised at how much sympathy I had for the characters by the end of the novel.  I would definitely recommend this novel for anyone who is looking for a perspective of WWI that demonstrates the struggle of the soldiers as well as other people involved with the war.

B000GCFO0I|4.0|You know I knew this was based on a video game of the same name but never played it so I really wasn't sure what to expect. So I'll give you a quick summary of the plot. Rose(Radha Mitchell) takes her sleepwalking daughter sharon to the place she keeps mentioning; Silent Hill. On her way there(after running from the law) she gets into a minor car accident and wakes up and discovers Sharon is missing and goes to find her in the ash clouded town of Silent Hill.  <br />O.k. the town of Silent hill is like a roach motel for people, they check in but don't check out. Once entered in Silent Hill, I didn't get the feeling of Forbodding right away, it was more dreamscapey and mysterious. By day Silent hill is foggy with ash falling from the sky like snow, and at night(Heralded by air raid horns from the church) its transformed into Hell, and quick.   The transformation of Silent Hill happens right before your eyes, and the effect are pretty good. This Hellish realm looks like who ever created it(for the film and I'm sure the video game) took page from Clive Barkers Hellraiser. Or from his Tortured Souls action figure line. Hell in Silent hill is a twisted place filled with disfigured abominations galore, burnt mutants, creepy crawlies and one big Mutha of a Hell enforcer, walk tall and carry  big--no no scratch that a Huge Sword. <br /> <br />This film had a lot of interesting camera angles.  Shot looking down at the characters. Wide pans on a tilt to show the vastness of some of the interiors, and some cool composites showing stuff in the foreground and in the distance. To me some of these scenes look as if they could have a comic book border around them. The only thing missing was the caption bubbles.  For those of you looking to be scared, you know, stuff jumping out at you, loud noises and such, forget it, its not that type of film. It is however a creepy film. Once things are revealed to you it starts to get under your skin. <br />And for those of you looking to check out the Gore in this movie, yes there is some gore, its not gratuitous as some other films. However, some of the gore effects that take place near and around the end of the film are pretty twisted even if they are computer generated.   <br />Sean Bean is in this film as Chis De Silva Roses' husband, while she is looking for the Daughter Sharon, He is looking for Rose, and there is an interesting juxtaposition between the real world and the Purgatory that is the Ghost town of Silent hill, as they are both in the same place, but not together.  Alice Krige plays Claudia, leader of the Silent hill moral majority who is more like a witch hunter than anything else.  I thought she did a great job creepy religious fanatic, those of you who can't place what other horror movie she was in may remember her in \\"Sleepwalkers\\" as the creepy shapeshifting  Mother who hates cats.  Laurie Holden plays officer Cybil Bennet, cool character.You may remember her as Debbie, Ben Grimms Girl in the beginning of the Fantastic Four.(or not) <br />I imagine that the time rose spent investigating the town had something to do with the Video game.  That, I thought was the only thing that was slow in this movie, not uninteresting, just a little slow. I would have like to seen some more of the horrors that the night time brought out, because those scenes were pretty damn cool. <br />Bottom Line.....highly entertainig, Excellent visuals. This ones a keeper.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|Not much more to say besides what it says in my headline.  80% of the album is absolute garbage.  B-Sides, at absolute best.  I can't believe the Chili Peppers wasted their time putting out a double album, with 80% filler.  What a joke!<br /><br />There are a few good songs: Dani California, Stadium Arcadium, Tell Me Baby.  A few decent songs: Charlie, Snow (Hey Oh), and a couple of others.  Then the rest is pure garbage.  Filler, at absolute best.  I can't even make it past most of the songs if I'm listening intently.  If it's background noise, then I can make it through both albums in their entirety.  Otherwise, no chance.<br /><br />The Chili Peppers downfall since Californication has been dramatic.  I shudder to think what a follow up to this abomination will be.
0425156842|5.0|Subtitled \\"A Novel About the History of Philosophy,\\" Sophie's World is a a unique and intriguing book that blends a basic history of philosophy with an enjoyable story, a philosophical mystery. The history of philosophy is very basic and most appropriate for those without much exposure to the field or a very rusty and rudimentary knowledge of it. The upper school where Mike teaches owns a class set and used it in a Western Civ class last year, which is how I was introduced to the book. I would recommend it to homeschoolers (appropriate for teenagers) and adults who are ashamed of their grasp of the history of the big questions. At the very least, it will give you a rubric and help to direct you to philosophical movements you might want to investigate more deeply.
B000002KON|5.0|Arthur or The Decline of The British Empire is a concept album that tells the story of a man who dreams of having a good house and a Car as well as the luxories of life. He is a Carpet installer whose brother Edward died in the Great War, and whose son Edward died in the Korean War, when another son named Derek wants to move to Australia, and take his wife Liz and two children with him. The album is full of Folk influences and early Rock influences as well as influences from The Beatles via Sargent Pepper's Lonley Heart's Club Band and \\"The White Album\\" including both Revolver and Rubber Soul, for I can hear all of those influences in the album.  <br />Shangri-La is by far the best song on the album alongside Victoria and Yes Sir, No Sir plus Australia, of what I have heared so far. Ray Davies is a true magician as a songwriter, with The KinKs being a band that has so many great hits and moments in thier history. I recomed this album fully.

B000002V0Q|5.0|I love it when some people give a review of a CD and compare it to something else.. as if the CD they are reviewing didnt sound enough like their favorite band(s) or something along those lines. PFFTOOEY! <br /> <br />I have had this CD for the last 10 years or so, and although heavy metal as I knew it has pretty much gone by the wayside .. this CD continues to be one of my all-time favorite HM CD's, one which I still listen to. Before buying this CD, I had already owned KISB and SFSGSW.. and was a little surprised at how this music went a bit towards the mainstream. That was until I heard the CD all the way through. The guitars-drums-bass are so tight it makes me wonder if they had to redo some of the songs over and over until they got it right..PERFECT even. I consider this CD a HM masterpiece. Megadeth was able to take their music and make it tighter without giving up their musical identity.  <br /> <br />I could care less who they DONT sound like.

076531178X|5.0|I was a fan of Sanderson's first novel, Elantris, though the novel had some pretty clear flaws. I'm an even bigger fan of his follow-up, Mistborn, a book that has all the plusses of Elantris without the problems.    Mistborn takes places in an ashen, devastated world where the \\"Skaa\\" are a brutally downtrodden majority who do all the work for the aristocratic minority of the Great Houses, who themselves are ruthlessly dominated (in differing ways) by the Lord Ruler, a religious godhead. Supposedly immortal--he's ruled for centuries via his magic power and his two competing bureaucracies--the \\"obligators\\" and the Inquisitors--a fearsome secret police who have steel rods impaling their eyes and who are near impossible to kill.  There are also ominous hints that the Lord Ruler also has been protecting the people of Mistborn from some great evil known as the Darkness.      The Skaa have seemingly lost any hope of rebellion over centuries of failed attempts but this all changes with the appearance of Kelsior--a Skaa/noble halfbreed who is a \\"Mistborn Allomancer\\", one who can \\"burn\\" swallowed metals that fuel magical/superhuman abilities, such as greater strength and endurance, greater use of the five senses, etc.  This magical system, a rare stroke of originality in a genre that too often lazes along with the same old tropes (oral spells, wizard's runes, etc), is one of the true pleasures of the novel.  It's also nice to see a system with some strong limitations to it--there are only ten metals that have the effect, one is limited by how much of the metal one has, and most allomancers have the ability to burn only one metal.  Kelsior, though, and his young female apprentice Vin, are true Mistborn, able to burn all ten.  The reader learns about the system sometimes through Kelsior's usage and sometimes through his tutelage of Vin, thus avoiding the clumsy early exposition of many fantasy novels as well as teasing out the explanation, adding a sense of suspense and mystery.     The basic plot involves Kelsior's gathering of a group of Skaa thieves to do the unthinkable--overthrow the Great Houses and the Lord Ruler. The secondary (though equally important) plot is Vin's coming-of-age as she is tries to move from being an orphaned street thief Skaa who trusts nobody to a full-fledged mistborn who can also play the role of an aristocratic lady.     As mentioned, there is a lot to like in Mistborn. The magical system. The focus on politics and economics as a means of rebellion (as opposed to \\"Dark lord bad.  Do bad things with swords.  We use swords and kill dark lord\\".)  The character development of Vin throughout the novel.  The character development of Kelsior.  The suspense over the impending rebellion.  The likeability of the side characters, who while not as fully developed as Vin or Kelsior, have their own distinctive and enjoyable personalities.  The humor that shows up now and then.  The quick pace of the action.  The twists and turns of plot.  Good action scenes. A few surprises at the end.  A sense of completion nicely balanced with an ominous sense that worse is to come.  The novel's structure, which has each chapter beginning with some paragraphs from the Lord Ruler's diary/journal during the days leading up to whatever event made him the Lord Ruler.  This facet works quite well on several levels, though to go into more detail would be perhaps to spoil the ending so I won't risk it. Suffice to say it was a nice touch of craft.    What's not to like?  The reader could have a greater sense of the world as a whole.  Sometimes one wishes for a bit more struggle by the characters, especially Vin who seems to move a bit too easily at times, too naturally into both foreign worlds--the magical one and the aristocratic one.  The ending seems somewhat rushed, though this is more a desire to linger over it rather than a complaint about what actually happens.  But these few flaws are certainly relatively minor and are completely overwhelmed by the book's positives.  Sanderson has done something rare here--written a sharply original fantasy that stands on its own as a single book while teasing the reader into a sense of impatience for the sequel.  Strongly recommended.
B00000J7SS|5.0|I see a lot of people talking about how difficult this album is, how you must sit and concentrate with intent and all this.. I'm sure that's fine, but personally, the ride home from the store was kind of \\"WTF?\\"... disappointed, and the traffic felt a million times worse, I live in Salt Lake and felt crowded as I'd imagine driving in NYC.   <br /> <br />But a week or so later, for no reason, decided to listen to it at about 1 in the morning.  Just got done drinking a few beers and leaned back in the couch, in the dark, not too loud, not too quiet...  <br /> <br />The music took me to amazing places, it was like time travel, spacey, but very archaic too,,, like a future that looks more the past.   <br /> <br />Honestly, this album might not be the best primer, but then again, those who are more savvy to things like 'kind of blue' may be even more thrown aback than they would if they'd weren't familiar.  But for me, I couldn't be happier, I shudder to think that I may have forever shelved this amazing record if I had trusted my first impression of it.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Everything Rick Ruben touches turns to gold and Stadium Arcadium is no exception. This release is goin' to win some Grammys. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium is the best work by the 'Chili Peppers to date. Just about every track in this 2 CD set quickly goes on your 'Chili Pepper favorites list. <br /> <br />These guys are talented dudes and Ruben takes that talent, synergizes and intensifies it an order of magnitude.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|This is the album I've been waiting for them to make since Blood Sugar. Although I can honestly say I can't find anything wrong with it, it just seems a little late. There's not much new here although they have done the right thing production wise and let John, Flea and Chad step up a little more than they have on the last 3 albums and economized some of Anthony's more and more schmaltzier tendencies. The songwriting here is of substantial quality and I have to say the production values are far and beyond above top notch. I can find no fault with this album and have to say it is quite good even though on a personal note I expected them to have already evolved far beyond this point by now. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is in my opinion one of the greatest rock albums of all time and a tough watermark to exceed, indeed. I guess I can't expect every rock band to be the Beatles, especially ones that have been around for well over 20 yrs. but this album definitely showcases in detail all the elements of this band that put them in the same league with such masters.
B000FSME1A|5.0|MOVIE: \\"We are the Hollow Men\\", reads Colonel Kurtz as he recites T.S. Eliot's poem in the shadows of his tomb. A man who has seen too much and has experienced the unthinkable. A mind that has broken in two and is now in shock with the world of men and has established himself as an enlightened being. Captain Willard (Sheen) has been assigned on a classified mission to head up river into Cambodia where Colonel Kurtz resides among a native tribe. The Colonel has been charged with murder, charged with murder in the middle of a war. They believe he has gone insane, that the war has warped his mind and he must be killed.<br /><br />Now Coppola masterfully carries the audience deeper and deeper into the jungle as we venture into the heart of darkness. The film is a masterpiece, a must own for any film enthusiast as well as the casual movie goer. The film is probably one of the darkest and most disturbing journeys you will take. A journey through the absurdity of war and how violence and power consumes us. Coppola himself almost went mad during the filming of this movie, and it's easy to see why. The scope of the film is huge, it carries so many characters yet never loses focus. The script is strongly influenced by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, probably my favorite piece of literature. Our main character journeys into the heart of darkness and through this journey comes rebirth and enlightenment as well as risk and sacrifice.<br /><br />The story is amazing, chilling, and haunting. The acting is some of the best captured on film, and the film's structure is flawless. I seriously mean that this a perfect film if there is such a thing. From the opening scene of the whooshing helicopter to the final words of Colonel Kurtz, the film is brilliant. Color is used strongly throughout the film to express changes in tone, and you as an audience member will be amazed by the stunning and beautiful cinematography. Apocalypse Now is part of our pop culture. How many times have you heard the quote, \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\\"? Even if you haven't seen the film you know about the helicopter raid played against 'The Ride Of The Valkyries'. Now we have a definitive edition on DVD that brings us both the original 1979 film as well as Coppola's extended cut from 2001. Redux sees 49 additional footage added to the original, and the result is a more complete feeling to the overall picture. Even if you own the previous releases, this one is a required purchase.<br /><br />VIDEO: The films are presented in 1.85:1 widescreen because Coppola wanted to make the most of the home theater experience. The picture is perfect, absolutely perfect. The transfers where enhanced to enrich the picture and the color and my god they are beautiful. The film shows no age at all, you would never guess that it was filmed in 1979. Perfect picture.<br /><br />AUDIO: As for sound, well, holy cow! What would you expect from the first film to use a six channel audio mix and led the way to the now standard 5.1 surround mix? This film gave birth to surround sound, so of course sound was important to Coppola. The Dolby 5.1 mix is amazing! Right when the signature helicopter whooshes started in the opening scene I felt chills run up and down my spine as the sound traveled around the entire room. The disc is technically flawless.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES: The set is also packed with a great wealth of bonus features. The commentary by Coppola is amazing to listen to. We also get extensive featurettes into the technical side of the film (surprised?). This disc is a must own for any up and coming filmmakers because these special features are specifically aimed towards film students and technical junkies. We take a look at the film's sound, the film's cinematography, the film's digitally synthesized score, and we also get 26 minutes of deleted scenes that were not part of Redux! There is also a Redux marker that signals which scenes were added into the new cut of thefilm. Both movies are split across both discs, and so are the special features. Acts 1 of both cuts are on disc 1 and Acts 2 are on the second disc. The only thing people are complaining about is the absence of \\"Hearts Of Darkness\\", which is an extensive 'making of' documentary considered to be the best 'making of' ever produced.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"The horror! The horror!\\" Those lines may haunt you after the film is over, but the DVD set is not horrible at all. You owe it to yourself to own this set even if you have the previous ones. If you haven't seen the film then you must not care much for movies.discs, and so are the special features. Acts 1 of both cuts are on disc 1 and Acts 2 are on the second disc.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If you have never played the video game, or never seen the anime (horrible) or bascially don't know much about final fantasy, this movie you can still watch if you are intrested in it. Its easy to understand, and if you get a bit confused, go online and research the story a bit. Its a great movie, I loved it, the fighting scenes are awesome. I feel in love with the characters. Watch the movie, you will like it. If you are a Final fantasy fan then you should love the movie even more!! <br />
B000GRTQXY|4.0|Fans seem to be split on this album. Overall I really like it. I wouldn't call it a throwback to earlier Primal Scream albums but it's definitely got that flavor. If you like the first single, Country Girl, then you'll probably like the rest of the album. <br /> <br />One thing that should be noted is that the Bonus Tracks listed on Amazon and the CD itself are incorrect. The actual tracks are Gimme Some Truth, Country Girl (live), and Suicide Sally & Johnny Guitar (live). Stone Ya To The Bone is not on the album.
B000GTLQXU|5.0|As a 10 year old, watching the original version of 'Poseidon Adventure' was at the time, an adventure. Up until that time, special effects were rather routine and sometimes unbelievable. Irwin Allen's masterful work made what could have been a trite film into a piece of art. <br />After viewing the film the first time, the audience exploded in applause, as during the film's running time, each viewer was caught up in each of the character's life, struggle, and more often than not, their demise. With the special effects, and superb set designs, i also joined them, as i witnessed one of the best films i have ever seen. At age 10, i guess i saw enough 'Creature Feature' and what TV had to offer in order to make such a comparison. <br />Since then, i have seen the original about 20 times, and each time, i do see, hear, and read between the lines more than what i saw during the previous viewing. <br />Sometimes it does take more than one viewing to understand not only what the actors do on-screen, but what the director wanted you to see, or think, then you make your own conclusion. <br />Now, on to the remake. <br />I am one to not like remakes. At times, there are needs to remake an original film due to artistic mistakes, to update in order to include more gore, violence, bad language, etc. These elements sometimes hinders the mood of the original film. Take for instance 'House On Haunted Hill', '13 Ghosts', House Of Wax'. These films not only were updated, but were changed to a point where it bore almost nothing to the original, except it's core story, otherwise they played for more of the elements that made them repulsive. <br />In the remake of 'The Poseidon Adventure', it did need an updating, mainly for the progress in the use of special effects, which were handled superbly. It took me awhile, like the previous critic listed here to get the nerve to see the remake. I was also kicking myself for not seeing it sooner, as i was blown away by the special effects. <br />One must remember, the original film had actors that were all famous. The remade version had a few familiar faces, but to me the rest i did not know, which to me made the film better than the original since it didn't matter to me who died, as long as the the handful of survivors made it to where they were supposed to go, to the bottom of the ship in order to be rescued. Films like these will always have unfortunate deaths in order to move the story along, as this one has, but also, one must remember, this is only a film, and films do not have to be made to win academy awards, but to entertain, which this remake does, in abundance. <br />The characters were developed just enough to care about them to a point, but was just enough to get the rest of the situation at hand when the wave hit, and the wave sure hits, and the action does not stop thereafter. In fact, there is rather little time from opening credits to the wave to get bored waiting.  <br />I gave the remake '5 stars' for the reasoning that all involved with the film did a job well done. Some, if not many who did not see the original should see this version first, just for the sake of seeing how far special effects has progressed from previous action films. Then, see the original, and see how the effects were at an age where effects were sometimes done in the camera, and manually, without CGI.  <br />Both versions are not to miss. As for the TV version of 'The Poseidon Adventure', well, i'd have to do another review on that one, but since it wasn't a great version, i will leave it up to others who may share my feelings. <br />
0671015206|5.0|But conspicuous consumers stay heavily in debt.  No, it isn't the doctors and lawyers who dominate America's millionaire population.  They are trapped into a consuming lifestyle to keep up appearances.  The real millionaires are the self made small business owners, who used their modest educations and incomes and plowed ahead living well below their means.  This book opens your eyes to the difference between financial offense (income earning capability) and defense (controlled spending).  Like professional football, the offense may be flashy and get attention, but the defense is more likely to send the team to the championship.  This book is outstanding.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This album is excellent. It's been a while since I have listened to an album that was as fresh and interesting as this album. Sure - I really liked \\"Crazy\\", i know it was a smash, but there were many other song on this album that had a nice beat, interesting lyrics and just \\"caught\\" something inside of me. I wish the artists all the best and thank them for a nice album

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Paul Simon's solo work is nothing to overlook. This is an album full of some of his 80s hits. \\"Graceland\\" and \\"Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes\\" and \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" are popular songs that many people would know if they heard them. The Everly Brother's sing backup on Graceland and help Simon to harmonize. A few of the songs never became popular but are as good as the ones that did. A classic album for any Simon and Garfunkel fan and for anyone who likes easy listening/rock music.
B000000W5L|4.0|That quote from \\"Bitch\\" (from \\"Sticky Fingers\\") perfectly sums up \\"Exile on Main Street\\". This album is the Stones' loosest, raunchiest, murkiest and sloppiest effort and I mean that as a compliment. The lyrics are often unintelligible and some of the songs sound like little more than slightly rehearsed jams. Recorded in the South of France in Keith's basement studio (among other locales), this sprawling work encompasses the Stones' usual rock sub-genres such as boogie-woogie, country, gospel, R&B and blues in addition to pure 'rawk'. Highlights for me include the sex-drenched \\"Rocks Off\\" built on one of Keith's classic riffs; the catchy hits \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and \\"Happy\\"; the gritty, country-tinged \\"Torn & Frayed\\" which also has some sly references to sex; \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" with its sometimes embarrassing, somewhat racist lyrics (though I'm sure they weren't meant to be); \\"Loving Cup\\" with its clever alcohol/sex analogy; the swaggering \\"Ventilator Blues\\"; the dark and lovely gospel of \\"Just Wanna See His Face\\"; the raucous \\"All Down the Line\\"; the remake of Robert Johnson's classic \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" and lastly the rousing \\"Soul Survivor\\".<br /><br />Though not quite up to the standards set by their best three albums which include \\"Beggars Banquet\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Exile\\" comes pretty damn close. As with the Beatles' self-titled album otherwise known as \\"The White Album\\", some editing would have made this another perfect, classic Stones effort. Sadly, \\"Exile\\" would be the last essential Stones release. \\"Goats Head Soup\\" would follow \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and that lame piece of crap makes \\"Exile\\" sound positively brilliant. By the time \\"Black and Blue\\" was released I had lost all interest in this formerly great band.
B000002JS6|5.0|This has great 80s music in it. I saw a commercial for a radio station with a man getting ready for work and shaving and singing \\"Back in Black.\\" \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" was played at most dances throughout high school and a few in college. Two friends from college sang that song as well and sounded just like AC/DC. This is a must for rock music fans.
B000G759LW|4.0|I've always been an admirer of Christina, especially after seeing the VH1 \\"Behind the Music\\" special on her life. That said, I never had any of her music in my collection . . . until now. My first impression: this girl can really sing; she is the real deal. It reminded me of how I reacted the first time I heard Whitney. Let's just hope Christina doesn't follow that route. I will spare all a disertation on Back to Basics -- it's already been done . . . quite well I might add and most of which I agree with. If you enjoy good music, great talent (both in front of and behind the mic) get this album. You will not be disappointed.
0895260131|5.0|In spite of the cheesy title and cover art this is not a political rant.  Spencer has excellent credentials with an MA in religious studies and years of study as an assiduous autodidact.  He is fluent in Arabic and is a well read scholar of the Qur'an.  Not once in this book does he interpose himself or his beliefs (he is a Catholic) into the text.<br /><br />Spencer makes good use of the depth and breadth of his knowledge of Islam to correct some of the errors contained in the \\"received wisdom\\" about that culture.  That received wisdom of course has \\"trickled down\\" from the academic elites with their political correctness, multi-culturalism and anti-Americanism.  (Proof that rot starts at the top of the barrel, not the bottom.)<br /><br />This is an outstanding account of Europe's Crusades to recover land that had previously been robbed from the West by Muslims.  But it is also much more than that.  Of particular interest is the PC notion that \\"Islam was originally a peaceful religion\\" and only later, after its lands were invaded by the imperialist West did it become violent (in self defense).  Spencer's scholarship leaves no doubt that Islam was continuously violent and expansionist starting from the time of its founder, Mohammad.  Islam's motive toward violence was not incursions by the West, but injunctions handed down by Allah and contained in the Qur'an.<br /><br />I did not care for the \\"Muhammad vs. Jesus\\" inserts in the text.  To me they were unnecessary and at times confusing.  What I did find useful were the recommended books inserted as \\"A Book You're Not Supposed to Read.\\"  Many of these were annotated so you have what amounts to an annotated bibliography interspersed within the text.  Unfortunately along with various other \\"boxed\\" comments this made for a cluttered appearance and detracted from a straghtforward reading of the book. All the citations are printed in a separate section \\"Notes,\\" at the end, which helped keep the text from becoming completely bogged down with inserts, comments, etc.<br /><br />In spite of these criticisms of style I still think this is an important book.  It was written for the average citizen.  I hope it reaches as many of our citizens as possible.<br /><br />P.S.  Perfect companion read, \\"Islamic Imperialism: A History,\\" by Efraim Karshrts, comments, etc.     In spite of these criticisms of style I still think this is an important book.

1594481938|5.0|A Long Way Down is a great kind of funny. The characters are the kind of people who you would meet in a pizza shop, at your mother-in-laws or at the top of a really tall building. They are human. They say good lines but then completely backtrack and spin their wheels just like anyone would. A Long Way Down is one of those great books that comes around once in awhile. When you're finished, you know it will be a bit before another good book comes along. If you like laughing out loud when you read, then you should buy this book.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad has been a blockbuster, so I was expecting a bit more \\"meat\\" to it than I got. <br /> <br />The book starts with a story of the author's father's monetary thinking and contrasts it with his friend's rich father (who becomes his financial mentor) and makes a point about how certain types of thinking can lead to financial success or failure.  I enjoyed this section of the book.  It read quickly while still getting the points across.   <br /> <br />After this, Kiyosaki expounds upon his six lessons.  Most of these were fairly common sensical.  The main points I took from this section were:  First and foremost, the power of your money comes from its ability to make you more money.  He explains that most people spend on \\"liabilities\\" instead of \\"assets\\".  It makes sense.  I particularly found interesting his contention that a house is more of a liability than an asset. <br /> <br />The author stresses the fact that people must be financially well-informed and feels that this is a shortcoming that most of us would do well to address.   <br /> <br />He also makes a great point of the fact that corporations are a godsend to people who choose to utilize them.  In fact, the author is very cognizant of the effects of taxes on our wealth, and stresses the ability to avoid paying excessive taxes in our quest for wealth.   <br /> <br />Most of the concepts the author discusses are solid, but there is little in the way of direction.  After reading the book, you will not feel compelled to move in any certain direction to amass your fortune.  It's not that kind of a \\"jump-start\\" book... <br /> <br />The most annoying thing about the book was the author's constant mention of the game he created called \\"CASHFLOW\\".  Enough already...
B000G759LW|5.0|BACK TO BASICS is a wonderful album, with a mesh of styles and genres, held together by Ms. Aguilera's special voice.  There are few artists who sing like her.   <br /> <br />I'm not going to go through each track...its been done.  My favorites on this records are \\"Slow Down Baby,\\" \\"Oh Mother,\\" \\"Without You,\\" \\"Candyman,\\" \\"Nasty Naughty Boy,\\" \\"I Got Trouble,\\" \\"Hurt,\\" and \\"The Right Man.\\"  While the first disc is really good, the second disc is GOLD. <br /> <br />Anyone who is still comparing Christina to Britney needs to have their ears checked.  Christina is an artist who has proven that her Grammy was no fluke.   <br /> <br />A+

B00005RYKV|3.0|While in no way Takeshi Kitano's best film, it is definitely an entertaining one. Kitano plays a Yakuza gangster forced to leave Japan for the U.S., where he unleashes just as much carnage as he did in his own homeland.<br /><br />The acting on the end of the Japanese actors is great on all counts. The English speaking actors don't fare as well and I don't think it could be attributed to inexperience as much as it would the language barrier. Still, it's definitely worth watching as it is pretty violent and hypnotic in an odd way.<br /><br />The DVD for this film is lacking in so many ways that it's not even funny. The film has a great video transfer that is pretty crisp and clean. Kitano is no slouch with the visuals and he manages to capture the elegance of Japan and Los Angeles with great shot composition and interesting angles.<br /><br />The 5.1 Dolby Digital is eye opening, to say the least. The dialogue is recorded low but whenever there's violence, it's LOUD. The first gunshot in the film nearly made me leap under my couch.<br /><br />The surround channels are used effectively and the score by Joe Hisaishi is enhanced greatly by this. That's one thing I have to say about this film: the score is absolutely amazing. Most of Kitano's movies are complimented by Hisaishi's music and this one is just as good as any of the others.<br /><br />This disc has no extras to speak of and frankly, I'm hoping to see a better disc come along for this film in the near future. An interview, a commentary track.... you will find none of these here. Not to mention that there are trailers for a couple of different films and none of them are for Brother itself.<br /><br />It's hard to recommend this disc due to the lack of features but at the very least, they did a good job with the sound and picture.
0393317552|5.0|This book absolutely deserves the New York times bestseller rating, as well the the Pulitzer prize that it won. It is very original, very thorough, and well written. <br />It seeks to answer the question \\"why are some cultures more advanced than others\\" and in order to answer this question, studies the geographical location that cultures have developed on. It points out the agricultural advantages, such as arable lands, mammalian advantages allowing for animals to be tamed for work and battle purposes, popultaion advantages allowing for development of writing etc. <br />I can not imagine someone being disappointed with this book as it is astounding in its depth, yet easy to read. Highly recommended.

I have to go to Europe to see Kylie live if I could.  <br />This is the best show of Kylie herself, nothing is comparable with the other american divas.
1401207138|5.0|All of these and more superlative adjectives apply to this amazing graphic novel.  Watchmen satisfies on many levels.  In my opinion, what sets the Classics (new and old) apart is that they are primarily CHARACTER-driven (with great plots) more than merely primarily plot-driven, which characterizes a lot of the fiction which is *here today, and gone today*: once you have read it and know what will happen in the plot, there is no compelling reason to read it again.  The classics mean different things to us at different points in our lives, since our own characters are always in a state of maturing and change.  Watchmen is just such an example of a new classic.
0446607274|5.0|Angels Flight was the first Michael Connelly/Harry Bosch book that I read and when I picked it up four years ago, I realized that Connelly was no ordinary mystery writer.  It took three more years to finally read the rest of this series, and since finishing them all, I wanted to go back and reread Angels Flight as I didn't remember much of what happened.  Not only did I enjoy it just as much the second time around, but it remains one of my very favorite Bosch mysteries.<br /><br />Howard Elias in a black civil rights lawyer who has made a name for himself suing the LAPD (this is a post Rodney King/OJ Los Angeles).  One of his clients is Michael Harris, a man who was acquitted of kidnapping and murdering a young girl, Stacey Kincaid.  He is now suing 15 members of the LAPD's Robbery and Homicide Division (RHD) for torturing him in trying to obtain a confession.  Two days before the trial is to open, Elias is murdered.  There are a whole bunch of cops who would like to see Elias dead and the citizens of LA believe a man in blue did the killing.  They expect that the LAPD will close ranks and engage in a cover-up to protect their own.  Tempers are raging and the city is on the verge of riots. Normally, this high profile case would fall to RHD.  But since they're all suspects, it is given to Harry Bosch and his partners, Kiz Rider and Jerry Edgar.  IAD and the FBI are also put on the case, which makes things more interesting and more complicated.<br /><br />Bosch discovers that during the Michael Harris trial, Elias was planning to expose the real killer in the Stacey Kincaid murder.  He decides to go back to square one in the Kincaid murder, believing that the killer of Kincaid and Elias are the same person.  In the course of the investigation, Bosch is shocked at what he discovers--from a child pornography ring to the bad judgment of those he thought he knew and trusted.  Through it all, the LAPD is trying to whitewash anything detrimental to the force.<br /><br />Connelly writes with true feeling and with the knowledge of one who has lived in LA and written the crime beat there.  When Kiz Rider picks up on Bosch's personal problems, Bosch muses \\"Her having picked up on his personal turmoil was a testament to her skill as a detective--reading people was always more important than reading clues.\\"  Also, a black lawyer attempts to explain to Bosch the reasons for the rioting in LA:  \\"It's about hope, detective...The minority communities of Los Angeles have no power, have no money, have no voice...When you take hope away, it leaves a void.  Some people fill that up with anger and violence.\\"<br /><br />The Angels Flight case does not quite play out so that all the issues are resolved.  Then again, we don't live in a perfect world.  But Connelly comes pretty close to perfect in writing this book./>Connelly writes with true feeling and with the knowledge of one who has lived in LA and written the crime beat there.

B000F1IQN2|5.0|I'm not a big fan of \\"inspired by true events\\" films, mainly because it can be impossible to distinguish truth from dramatic license at any given moment, but Munich represents the genre at its best.  It's an important movie because the events of this story lie beneath the surface for those of us who are too young to have actually watched the drama play out back in the summer of 1972.  We hear references to it every four years during the Summer Olympics and think about how awful it must have been, but I don't think I ever read or heard the whole story - especially Israel's actions in response to the kidnapping and murder of eleven of their Olympic athletes in Munich.  The Israeli government's determination to mete out justice to the terrorists responsible for the plot easily lend themselves to questions on ethics, morals, and the like - and this aspect of the story really becomes the centerpiece of this motion picture.<br /><br />The Munich massacre is one of the real lynchpins in the history of Islamic terrorism.  When a group of Palestinian terrorists calling themselves Black September (and aligned with Yassir Arafat) infiltrated the Olympic Village in Munich, held eleven Israeli athletes hostage, and eventually slaughtered them all in the midst of an incompetent German rescue attempt, the Palestinians succeeded in attracting world attention to their cause.  Germany soon handed the terrorists another major victory, cowardly releasing the three terrorists arrested (the others were killed) for the crime in acquiescence to the demands of other terrorists (hijackers in this case).  Seeing that no justice would be forthcoming in European courts, Golda Meir gave a green light to a daring plan to kill the eleven most prominent planners of the massacre.  This is the dramatized story of five men who gave up their own identities to serve their country in Operation Wrath of God.<br /><br />The film centers around the team leader, Avner (Eric Bana), and the emotional effect this operation had on him as the mission advanced from one target to another.  The whole group of Mossad agents was something of a motley crew, as none of them had the kind of qualifications I would expect of assassins charged with such a dramatic mission.  Director Stephen Spielberg did a fantastic job of generating real tension in the moments leading up to each assassination attempt, and then made each hit as violently realistic as possible.  Still, I do think the plot has some shortcomings.  Early on in particular, I sometimes missed a connection between one scene and another; for example, I'm still a little hazy on exactly how Avner struck up his relationship with his main informer.  Likewise, I have to believe it could never be so surprisingly easy to gain access to a target's residence in order to set up a given hit.<br /><br />At two hours and forty-five minutes, some will say that Munich is too long and that it drags in spots, and I can see some viewers questioning the nature of the film's final twenty minutes or so.  Those later scenes are very important, though, as they basically transform the film from a suspenseful action flick to a deep and almost philosophical examination of good and evil, personal responsibility, ethics, and the like.  When you're an assassin, you just don't put everything you've seen and done behind you after the fact.  Avner is truly haunted by his own actions, seeking some kind of assurance that he had done the right thing.  The whole presentation manages to magically walk a line between the competing ideologies of the Palestinians and the Israelis, asking tough questions of each side and examining events from both perspectives.  Whereas an Oliver Stone would have politicized this story up to its eyeballs, Spielberg keeps the film surprisingly objective in its presentation.<br /><br />Besides a grim reminder that terrorism is by no means a new phenomenon, Munich finds ready application to the lively debates of the present day.  The questions surrounding this story are the same kinds of questions being asked today in Western society (partly because we've let this cancer of the body politic fester for decades).  That is what makes this film especially important.day.

B0007P3582|2.0|Got Rich and stopped tryin'.  Seriously, what happened here.  I thought this cd was supposed to be like 10 times what \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" was.  I also thought it was going to sell 12 million copies(only 4.9 million in the U.S. to date) to outsell \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\", but that didn't happen either.  Don't get too excited about my review because I'm being nice by giving it a 2.  As my man Cub says, this cd was single driven, meaning outside of singles, this cd is wack.  I'm not necessarily a 50 hater either, I am eager to hear his next effort, I'm just giving facts here.  I'm not hatin', just statin'.  The production is very nice on this cd, but clearly outshines 50 talking(yes talking!) on all but a couple tracks.  Seriously, if XXL had some balls they'd do a \\"Step your game up\\" segment on Curtis Jackson aka 50 Cent aka Curtis \\"Interscope\\" Jackson.  The \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" soundtrack was a nice rebound after this bad cd, but 50 needs to put the ego aside because he is ruining the once dominant label.  He couldn't co-exist with Game, arguably hotter than him and didn't want anyone hotter than him on G-Unit.  Earth to 50, Llyod Banks is hotter than you, but you are continuing to hold him back, but he's loyal to you so there will probably never be any issue there.  G-Unit is fading fast and it's on 50's shoulders.  So let the mediocre Massacre stand testiment, say a few prayers with \\"Murder\\" Mase and start putting out some good music!  <br />
B000G759LW|3.0|I like Christina I think her voice is great. However the cd as a whole is not worth 4 or 5 stars-it should have been only one disc.

I love 70's disco and especially old Donna Summer and Madonna took that concept and ran with it.  Best Dance album ever. Once you hear the stirrings of \\"Hung Up,\\" which is the first track...you're hooked.
B00005JOYM|5.0|\\"World Trade Center\\" is the true story of police officers John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Pe&ntilde;a), who were trapped on the concourse between the North and South Towers, beneath the rubble when the Towers came down.  The movie follows them from early morning on 9/11/2001 to their rescue.  While trapped, they must rely on each other to survive long enough to be found.  A friendship forms in the most awful of places, and neither would have probably survived if it wasn't for the other.  It is also the story of their wives, Donna (Bello) and Allison (Gyllenhaal), and how they had to deal with not knowing what had happened to their husbands.<br /><br />\\"World Trade Center\\" is almost as good as \\"United 93\\", the other 9/11 movie from this year.  It has been made tastefully, and shows heroism in a terrible time of national crisis.  Cage and Pe&ntilde;a do good jobs as the two leads, spending most of their time under rubble where only there faces are shown.  They make these people real.  Oliver Stone's direction is good, and he makes the story very compelling.  This, along with \\"United 93\\" is one of the must see movies of the year.  I highly recommend it.

B0000714BP|4.0|This is Pricilla: Queen of the Desert set in Texas. But gosh...this movie's just so cute. Attacking this film is like going after a defenseless bunny with a bazooka.  Most of the jokes are funny and the actors actually sort of look like women. Sort of.    Actually, Leguizamo as the Latin cross-dresser Chi-chi is so feminine it's insane. His performance is reason enough to see this movie, seriously. He got all the mannerisms and body movements spot-on. Chi-chi gets all the best lines (I got more legs than a bucket of chicken) and just steals the whole movie. Buff action hero Wesley Snipes, prancing around a stage trying to look like a woman. He could be the greatest actor in the universe and I still wouldn't buy him as a drag queen. In fact, with his bulging muscles he's pretty ridiculous. He's still better than I expected (Swayze is worse). There's this drag queen competition, and the winner gets to go to the drag nationals in Hollywood. Vida (Swayze), Noxeema (Snipes, don't ask) & Chi-Chi (Leguizamo) all enter but the winner comes out at a tie: Vida and Noxeema are both going to Hollywood, baby. Sorry Chi-chi.    After an encounter in a stairwell with Chi-chi, who is pouting like a sad chihuahua, Vida decides on a whim to bring Chi-chi along for the trip. Since they're short one plane ticket and Noxeema is too big a diva to be seen riding a bus, they all go out and buy the crappiest Cadillac you've ever seen and sort of hope it will get them from New York to L.A. The trio gets pulled over (again, in full drag for some reason) by a seedy sheriff (Chris Penn) who tries to feel up Vida and as a reward gets bashed in the face. If he stood five inches from Patrick Swayze in drag and just said \\"Dang, you're tall\\", then he deserved it. Predictably, the Cadillac breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and the drag queens all have to flee to the nearest town until it gets fixed and they can get going to Hollywood. The town of Snydersville is smaller than my high school gym. It's a bunch of wooden ramshackle buildings that look like they were airlifted in. It's full of classy actresses like Blythe Danner and Stockard Channing who act like total hayseeds.     Leguizamo for his part is 120% convincing as a loser drag queen. I almost sniffled a little too at the Coca-cola scene. He's the only one I bought as a woman, which is funny because he's supposed to be the most inexperienced of the three, and the other two (who are dogs) keep lecturing him on how to graduate from 'drag princess' to a queen. Chris Penn's retarded villain is the only low point. Robin Williams is in there, awesome as ever, even though he only gets one scene. Highly reccomend, if only to rent it once (Then if you like it, rent Pricilla afterward). Go ahead, it won't make you less of a man. I think.

1400032717|5.0|The book is narrated in style similar to Holden Caulfield in \\"A Catcher in the Rye\\", except the narrator happens to be autistic.  Christopher excels in a world of black and white but has great difficulty when dealing with any shade of grey.  When he sets out to investigate the death of his neighbor's giant poodle in the spirit of his hero Sherlock Holmes (though he detests Arthur Conan Doyle), the clues lead him straight into the greyest area of all, the world of human relationships and emotion. <br /> <br />Beyond the novelty of consistently telling the story through such a non-standard narrator (which works very well, by the way), the choice to tell the story in this way seems to give even more poignancy to the emotional drama that plays out.  Within the world of the novel you may feel that the experience has changed Christopher, which is debatable, but there is little doubt that the story will have a profound effect on the reader.

The cast displayed excellent vocals and Joss Whedon did an awsome job writing the music. The CD contains all of the music from the episode and more, including: Suite From \\"Restless\\":Willows Nightmare/First Rage/Chain Of Ancients, Suite From \\"Hush\\":Silent Night/First Kiss/Enter The Gentleman/Schism, Sacrifice (from \\"The Gift\\" and a cool demo of Somthing To Sing About with vocals by Kai Cole and music performed by Joss Whedon! All of which make excellent additions to the CD. All songs are actually performed by the cast of the show. My favorites on this album would have to be: I've Got A Theroy/Bunnies/If We're Together, I'll Never Tell, Rest In Peace, Walk Through The Fire, Standing. All of the other songs are also excellent but the ones that I think are the best.<br /><br />Buy this CD!!
7884064790|1.0|this set looks like a great deal, but if it's the same as the one that i bought on ebay (and it sure looks as if it is), the english subtitles are so awful that the films can only be viewed for humour.  probably fine if you are fluent in japanese, but for the average american viewer a worthless investment.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|This is to me the best Mobb Deep album since \\"Hell on Earth.\\"  Real tight beats, and decent lyrics.  A couple joints Prodigy's verses sound very much like 50 Cent versus, like on \\"Put 'em in their place\\" and \\"pearly gates.\\"  Havoc does his normal excellent job on production, and if you know the Mobb you know they are what they are lyrically.  G-Unit's cameos are all very decent, especially 50's, who picks the songs with the tightest beats to make appearances on.  \\"It's alright\\" is a very tight joint with a great sample feat. Mary J. Blige.  Features excellent production by Alchemist and Dr. Dre also.  Must have for the Mobb collectors.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|2010 Update: Buy this now! If you wait you may end up writing a review that mirrors the following review that I wrote below in 2006....<br /><br />It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic just last week for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Beauty and the Beast by the time Disney released it again.<br /><br />Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Beauty and the Beast, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.<br /><br />There are plenty of other reviews here to discuss the movie's contents, so I won't go on about that. I will say that you should take advantage of purchasing Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.<br /><br />And indeed, you will enjoy Beauty and the Beast as thoroughly as your young one.<br /><br />Side Note on Resellers: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers.

B000F39MAQ|5.0|I've been listening the Recording of this DGG Traviata before been released on DVD. I was neglected to admit Netrebko as a good Violetta. I thought she was overacting, with an exageration i didn't like. The same with Thomas Hampson, who sounded very exagerated too. Rolando Villazon, otherwise, was suitable to the role, with a beautiful voice during the opera. Not my favorite version among my collection.<br /><br />Then i saw the DVD two days ago, and i just adored the new perspective Willy Decker gave us to this GH. Is like watching a very old popular opera just for the very first time. At first I was confused, but throughout the minutes I could follow the ideas. I loved the interiorization of the characters, or the presence of this old man wich represented the Death for Violetta. Or the farewell of the guests in the 1st act, when the joy is replaced by desespoir with Violetta trying to stop the unstoppable clock. Clever ideas.<br /><br />I owned Decker's production of Don Carlo on DVD, wich I recently saw too, and I'd say that his personal interpretations suit perfectly my expectations, because he's constantly revising the texts and history, and looking for new ideas that result in new points of view, and helps reviving the author's intentions into our time.<br /><br />I would say that, those classic versions of Traviata must turn into contemporary settings. Because Verdi's intention was create an opera based on his own time.<br /><br />Rizzi was speedy sometimes, I have to admit. But in this case, it wasn't that bad for the intention of this production. I'd love to see the extras to find out how Decker and Rizzi shared their ideas.

0670813028|3.0|I swear that the monster I had in my head was so much scarier than that Tim Curry clown on the mini-series.  Good book.  Scary and typical Stephen King with a supernatural ending.
0156027321|5.0|This novel works best when viewed not as a possibility- like most modern fiction- but as a fable, with the events exaggerated and elements of the fantastic present. Only then is it possible to accept the improbable here, and see the story as a clever means of conveying lessons about religion and faith. Like religious belief, Martel wants us to make a leap of faith with him, and consider the ramifications of the story he's telling rather than argue the details. On that level, the book is brilliant, and raises some important ideas that are worth mulling over when the book is done.<br /><br />-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein
0613574877|5.0|Watchers is a great story. I bought this item for my wife so she could read it on our vacation. She needed larger print than the paperback version so I found this hardback on Amazon. When the book arrived, it was a paperback that someone had converted into a hardback by changing the cover. <br />I was dissapointed with the purchase.
0440180295|5.0|This is a very funny novel that- in retrospect- breaks your heart; it's the blackest black humor you will ever read.<br /><br />It must have taken great courage for Vonnegut- as talented as he is- to take the Allied bombing of Dresden Germany during WWII and make it the main stage for this theater of the absurd tale, particularly since he witnessed firsthand what happened to Dresden. Fail, and you risk being pummeled by the critics for trivializing a horrific, nearly unimaginable event. (For those who don't know, Dresden wasn't \\"just\\" bombed; it was turned into a raging firestorm, with hurricane-force winds dragging thousands of victims into the flames to be cremated, and depleting the oxygen in the underground shelters, leaving thousands more asphyxiated.) But Vonnegut didn't fail; he succeeded brilliantly in conveying the absurdity of war by not embellishing events, the tone of the book remarkably matter-of-fact as his main character- Billy Pilgrim- jumps through time and space, gaining a unique perspective on the follies of mankind.<br /><br />The name of his main character is especially telling of Vonnegut's intentions. Perhaps the most famous Billy in literature is Melville's Billy Budd, an innocent soul whose fate is an unjust death that suggests life is predetermined. And Pilgrim brings to mind John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, an allegorical tale of the escape from the City of Destruction (Dresden) to the Celestial City of enlightenment (the home world of the superior Tralfamadorians, who explain human existence to Billy.)<br /><br />Perhaps by writing Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut gained some measure of catharsis, found a way to deal with his memories of Dresden and its aftermath. Like many veterans whose refuse to discuss their war experiences, a more direct, \\"realistic\\" approach to the firebombing might have been too painful. By taking an indirect approach, however, he was able to open a door that otherwise would have remained locked. That's fortunate for us, since Slaughterhouse Five rises above the historical account of that terrible event to address the larger issue of what it means to be human in a world where what humans do doesn't always make sense.<br /><br />This is an insightful, important book, and one of Vonnegut's best.<br /><br />-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einsteinouse Five rises above the historical account of that terrible event to address the larger issue of what it means to be human in a world where what humans do doesn't always make sense.

0780626966|4.0|When I say good, I mean way better than the Friday the 13th movies anyway lol. What I love about the movies is that they mix fantasy with horror. So it's not just gory and disgusting, it's imaginative and inventive as well.<br /><br />  Nightmare on Elm Street: Nancy's friends start getting killed off in their dreams by disfigured man with claws and it's up to her to stop him. His name is Freddie Krueger and he was burnt to death by angry parents of children that he murdered. So now he's back for revenge in the town that he died killing teenagers in their sleep. The result is a scary and often goofy \\"what Freddy movie isn't a little goofy ?\\" film. *** out of ****<br /><br />  Nightmare on Elmstreet 2: This is probably the worse one. I mean a new kid moves in to Nancy's house and Freddy takes over his body. He doesn't just take over his body though, he rips through his body to get into the real world and kill people. Plus get this...the guy is still alive after he rips through his body and climbs out into the real world. He's not just still alive though...he doesn't have a mark on him. So yeah this is the worse even if Freddy is probably his scariest here and is no nonsense. **<br /><br />  Nightmare on Elmstreet 3: Part 3 brings Nancy back and she wants to help kids in a Psychward that Freddie is after. This is probably the most imaginative one. While it has good effects and is really gory gross on top of it. I mean there's a kid that makes puppets so in his sleep Freddie walks him with his veins like he's a puppet. Which is pretty hard for even me to watch lol. It gets a little corny when Nancy shows  the kids that they can fight back and do whatever they want in there dreams but still it's one of the better sequels.<br />*** out of ****<br /><br />  Nightmare on Elmstreet 4: This is also one of the better sequels. Freddie comes back and kills all the survivors from part 3. Their friends soon realize that Freddy is after them as well and that they need to fight back. This film is imaginative but hard to watch for me. Mean is one gross part with meatballs with faces on them and Freddie eats them of course. Then there's one part where he turns a punk girl into a bug and crushes her. The film is still well made and entertaining though.<br />***<br /><br />  Nightmare on Elmstreet 5: The girl from part 4 that killed Freddie is back and pregnant and Freddie is back too of course. He wants her...baby for his own ? It's not as bad as part 2 but it's not very good anyway. ** 1/2 out of ****<br /><br />  Freddie's Dead: Not scary but pure whacky imaginative fun and yes sadly it's one of my favorites. I mean you have Freddie controlling a kid like he's playing a video game, him killing a kid with a hearing aid by making a lot of noise until...his head explodes. Plus yes it even has a smart unpredictable script. I wanna say ***1/2 but I may get too many unhelpful reviews if I say that lol. So I'll just say ***.<br /><br />  Wes Craven's New Nightmare: This is also one of the best. It has the actress that plays Nancy finding that Freddie is fighting his way into the real world. He plans on using her son to get into the real world. Plus he is killing people in their sleep as well and kills her husband. It's up to Nancy..I mean Heather to stop Freddie and save her son. The movie is mindbending and actually scary at times. With Robert Englund being more scary than goofy. ***1/2 out of ****k. This film is imaginative but hard to watch for me.

B000051VWW|2.0|i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Yep, the best film so far this century. The best on every level; the story, the screeplay, the directing, the acting the cinematography, the soundtrack all come together to create a film far greater than the sum of it's parts.
B000GCFO0S|1.0|This film has such great visuals...<br /><br />It is such a shame this Blu-ray version, who should be great, is in fact so mediocre I could swear I was watching a standard DVD.<br /><br />Some people say it is the codec they're using... I don't know... but the image here is fuzzy and full of artifacts. I don't know what's still going on... these blu-ray releases keep coming out far below what they should.<br /><br />Such a shame. I regret to say, HD-DVD still has no competition.<br /><br />The film is great.<br /><br />Its blu-ray edition is not.<br /><br />And no extras??????

B000GFLEX6|4.0|Originally released in 1978, David Gilmour's first solo album now appears here in excellently remastered form.      This 2006 reissue is a treat for diehard fans because many of the songs feature longer fade-outs than the original CD (and presumably the original LP as well).  For instance, the superb \\"No Way\\" runs more than 30 seconds longer, and the extension of the track really feels right.  \\"Raise My Rent\\" also gets a roughly 15-20 second extension, which maybe doesn't sound like a big deal on paper, but Gilmour really tears the roof off the sucker on this track, so letting the tape run a little longer is most welcome.    As for the album as a whole, it's pretty easy to see why some listeners would tag it as \\"Pink Floyd lite\\", but I think that gets to the core of its appeal--this is a really good album to put on for just plain chilling out.     Gilmour's blues influence really bubbles to the surface on many of the tracks here. Just take a look at the simple-but-irresistible bluesy riffs on \\"Cry From The Street\\" and \\"No Way\\", and his extended soloing on \\"Raise My Rent\\". Even the radio hit \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" has a swampy opening hook that sounds like its being played in unison by an electric guitar and a blues harmonica.     The moody, slide guitar-fortified \\"No Way\\" grooves along irresistibly, as does \\"Cry From The Street\\" with its crunchy rhythm guitar (the latter does have a ho-hum speeded-up fade, but it's quite brief). The instrumental \\"Raise My Rent\\" features a lush-sounding, arpegiatted electric guitar riff--again, simple but irresistible--and it serves as a canvas for Gilmour's superb soloing, plus the subtle electric piano and organ flesh out the sound to excellent effect. The harmony-fest \\"Short And Sweet\\" is another splendid track, with its catchy, droning guitar riffery.     The rest is generally enjoyable too even if it's underwhelming. The tender \\"So Far Away\\" is a pretty piano-based ballad, but somewhat lacking in focus. The album-opening instrumental \\"Mihalis\\" is nice enough, although it leans too far toward listless, generic Muzak for its own good. \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" is a good song, with Floyd-style female backing vocals, although it feels kind of routine and passionless. \\"Deafinitely\\", another instrumental, with a skittering \\"Sheep\\"-style rhythm, unfortunately overdoes its repetitive and gimmicky sound effects and ends up falling quite flat. The album-closer \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\" starts off nice, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and feels rushed through.     So, the album is disappointing on some level. Gilmour does seem to be coasting a bit here, and if he would have brought some more passion and focus to the proceedings (like he would do on his subsequent \\"About Face\\"), this maybe could have been a great album. Still though, it's a really good listen even as it is, and it's interesting to see how it contrasts to the Floyd albums that it's sandwiched in between (\\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\").
B00003W8NM|2.0|I'm sorry folks, I just didn't \\"get it.\\" The acting was great and the story was original, and for that I give this movie 2 stars. But other than that, why watch this movie? It's just a bunch of bizarre, mindless violence. Is watching people beat each other's faces into a bloody pulp for fun supposed to be \\"art\\", perhaps? <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong - because I like actual boxing. But this wasn't boxing. This movie was just plain sadistic. Or masochistic, take your pick. It was one of the strangest and most outright bizarre movies ever.  <br /> <br />Sorry people, I just didn't get it. NOT RECOMMENDED. <br />
B0000027D5|5.0|The only thing that would be better than listening to this great CD would be to listen to and watch this great recording on DVD. To watch what this band and the fans experienced at this concert has to be a thrill.  The only thing better than a DVD would be to watch this concert with documentary-style interviews and hear what fans had to say about their experiences.  The only thing better than that would be to have been there myself, live as one of the fans being interviewed and not being able to express in words how great Santana's performance was.  The only thing better than that would have been to be Carlos Santana at that time and experience what he must have felt.  It had to be a joy to channel so much spiritual energy.
B000EULJLU|3.0|If you wait 5 years for an album, your expectations are naturally high, and after leaving us with an album like 'Lateralus', expectations are greater than ever. I'd never thought i'd say this, but Tool have failed to deliver here. I am still a fan of the band no doubt and always will be.. but i am disappointed. <br /> <br />11 tracks on the album, 5 or 6 of them are actual 'songs'. Those songs rock indeed - Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot are the stand out tracks. The rest, as everyone says are fillers, some tend to progress into what might be a song, but end with no real direction. I must say that the packaging for this CD is the best i have ever seen. A true piece of art. The price of the CD is worth than alone (...ok, maybe not). But, the artwork is an experience in itself.  <br /> <br />At the end of the day, its the music that matters... and while this is NOT a bad album, it certainly isn't a great one... like one i was expecting. Hopefully by 2010 we'd have another one that'll prove what Tool really can do.
B000002HO3|4.0|Sure I had heard a few of the songs, but rest of the songs on this album are equally wonderful. Mick Hucknall is a great singer and I would to see him live.
B000002KIT|4.0|Damn fine seventeen track live Thin Lizzy lp,from two different shows (I'm assuming) during their 1976-77 tours. Only regret I have is that of all the numerous concerts I've attended, I've never seen these guys. Most memorable tracks were \\"Jailbreak\\", \\"Massacre\\", \\"Johnny The Fox Meets Johnny The Weed\\", \\"Cowboy Song\\", \\"Boys Are Back In Town\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\". Line-up: Phil Lynott - bass & vocals, Scott Gorham - guitar, Brian Downey - drums, John Earl - sax and Tony Visconti - piano & producer. Good album rock, well worth checking out.
1401302378|3.0|This is the kind of book that will be vaguely remembered in the years to come, as an attempt to capture the present and predict the future. As such, it is not a bad attempt, but it suffers from the usual problems this kind of book has: grasping at trends, making them not only universal but also overpowering, and running away with the resulting thoughts.  <br /> <br />Enamored with the initial idea, that there is a \\"long tail\\", or power distribution of demand in digital goods that is different to the short head / slightly less short tail of \\"material\\" goods, the author extracts facts from their context to prove that his theory works in any possible dimension, area of knowledge and human activity. Although the initial concept is interesting, the extrapolation are overtly simplifying trends that depend on many different elements, like the existence of an economy with significant surpluses, allowing for unfettered cultural consumption, something that may or not be relevant to many different countries and that may face significant problems after the \\"Hubbert peak\\", or the end of cheap oil.  <br /> <br />So, it is entertaining, it is estimulating in a non-academic sense, but ultimately is a book that demands a critical reading and a large quantity of salt grains. I do not regret buying it, but neither I'll take it too seriously.
B000002WYT|4.0|This record does not need me to hype it up.  With songs such as #41, Crash into me, Cry Freedom, Let You Down, etc., and with the production genius of Steve Lillywhite, the beauty of this record absolutely speaks for itself.  This record will always hold a spot in my heart and in the heart's of all DMB fans, i am sure.
006056251X|4.0|Enjoyable romance.  Well written, enjoyable characters, and story.  Not very believable for the last third, once they return to London.  Too much sex for my taste.
B000HF2NF8|5.0|James McTeigue & the Wachowski brother's truly give us film fans something to drewl over here. \\"V for Vendetta\\" is not only more than relevant to the dark capitolist(New World Order)times we are living in right now,but it is also simply a perfect example of brilliant film making. If you watch this film & find any flaws your either a lieing non-film fan or a lieing right wing neo-con & it doesn't really matter then because your bogus opinion is irrelevant. For us true film fans though,this Two-disk Collector's Edition w/Mask & mini promo posters/goodies is what collecting films/dvd's is all about. Without a doubt the best collector's edition I have ever purchased! What an absolute treat!
B000EHRVP6|2.0|\\"Hostel\\" leads you to believe that this is going to be a very scary movie with lots of violence that haven't been seen before, and all it gives in the end is porn and things done to death in horror movies. The story is so basic; you don't even have to hear what they are saying to get this movie. There are times when I was watching the movie and said something to someone and still understood what was going on, even though I didn't hear a few lines. There is nothing shocking in this movie and it is very predictable.<br /><br />The gore is almost absent and is nothing extreme; I have seen more gore in the Friday the 13th series. About the first thirty to forty minutes of the film is sex and more sex. This is not a film for the kiddies, that's for sure. Overall, if you want a movie that is like this but actually has a good story, watch the Dentist and the Dentist 2. This film has nothing special at all. The movie is not scary and not gory. It misses all the points that made the Saw series great, which it tries to live up to in this film. This movie isn't horrible by any means, it just not all the hype leads you to believe. It is a soft core porn movie with a little blood thrown in.
B000AP04FG|1.0|You've seen the trailers, suffered the E! specials, maybe read the celebrity-worship zines,  You know what it's about, yet nothing can quite prepare you for just how plainly and nonsensically unentertaining \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" really is.  Brad & Angelina are two high-priced contract killers - practically superheroes.  The biggest and baddest in the business, neither has any idea of the other's true identity.  It was only a matter of time before they crossed paths, but even odds that they would do so under circumstances that allowed each to stay secret from the other.  The joke is that neither of the two has a real life besides meting exotic forms of execution, so it's no surprise that their marriage is as sexless as the movie.  Eventually, they learn the truth, and become each other's highest-priced targets.  After they've destroyed just about everything else of their lives but each other, they realize that their own bosses aren't happy about their pairing, and will eagerly finish the two of them off if they can't oblige themselves.  Thus, we've got some car chase, lots of gunplay, and too many sub-machinegun-men-in-black to count. <br /> <br />In varied parts, you can see that the producers of \\"Smith\\" intended to make a romantic comedy thriller - or parts of such movies rolled up into one.  Unfortunately, \\"Smith\\" fails at each juncture.  The action is canned - lots of obvious stunts that the script telegraphs or sometimes fails to telegraph at all.  (There's a raid on a courthouse in which it's virtually impossible to follow the action.)  Also, the screenplay has neglected to supply a convenient villain - the \\"Hans Gruber\\" that puts the human face on all those black-clad & sub machinegun-armed toadies.  All that inaction wouldn't hurt the story that much as the backdrop to a romantic comedy about the Smiths, but the leads have absolutely no chemistry - in fact, most of the time, it's hard to tell what they're even saying. They don't so much as speak their lines, butdeliver them - which we can probably blame on a script that's already obviously in need of the leads' star-power.  In fact, \\"Smith\\" is so dependent on who's starring in it, that the whole thing begins to look like one of those movies that indie-moviemakers have been warning us about for years, the overpriced, over-cast, overproduced pure-Hollywood production about nothing.
B000001FYZ|3.0|This is the Scorps first album of the 90's and isn't a bad piece of music at all. But truth be told it is a little bland. Sure tunes like Hit Between the Eyes and Tease Me Please Me race along quite happily and Kicks after Six cruises along propelled by Klaus Meines vox but much of this album just doesn't quite have that elusive X factor. It is a little sickly smooth and even the power ballads seem a little dull, and that's pretty much what the band was becoming known for at the time.<br /><br />Money and Fame show the Scorpions could still spit and snarl with the best of them if they chose to but there is precious little display of bared fangs elsewhere on the album. The ballad Send Me an Angel, tacked onto the end of the album like some sort of bonus track actually became a hit in a number of territories. Not sure why but hey, nobody asked me!<br /><br />The real saving grace for this album is the fact that it produced Wind of Change. This monster of a hit would not of struck gold at any other time, it was written and released at a time when certain historic events were taking place. There truly was a Wind of Change going through Europe in the couple of years after this album was put out and that's why heavy rock fans of a certain vintage will always 'zone out' when they hear this song on the radio. Which you often do as it transcended metal or hard rock, it captured the zeitgeist of the moment to perfection, encapsulating a feeling of optimism that fluttered and die in Europe a few years later, and then in the US a few years after that.<br /><br />BUT - as towering as that song is, and as solid as a few of the rockers are this is not an essential album for the casual Scorps fan unless you pick it up 2nd hand cheaply. For the casual hard rock fan I'd suggest you get yourself a few other releases instead, those being Virgin Killer (1977), Tokyo Tapes (78) and maybe even Best of Rockers and Ballads (89) - the latter two particularly being a good taste tester for this bands product up to the end of the 80's.or this bands product up to the end of the 80's.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|Although I enjoyed the original, I found myself dosing off numerous times during the almost two and a half hour movie.  Not the remake.  This version kept me on the edge of my seat and the special effects were awesome, especially in surround sound! I'm not a big fan of all of these Hollywood remakes going on but the film makers did a good job on this one.  The acting is good with a descent cast and rather than dragging on for two and a half hours this one gets right to the point in about an hour and forty minutes.  If you own the original than you must add this to your collection.  I beleive that anyone who enjoys good action films like myself will appreciate this movie, especially for this special price!

Half of a man or a piece of a man is NOT EVER acceptable, especially after reading and re-reading this book!
B000ASDFEU|4.0|2,000 men out of 10,000 survived in the charge for the five bridge.  \\"I alway thought, we went one bridge too far\\".  The movie is heavy with carnage, death, and civilian habitat destruction and decimation.  The generals knew the campaign would be lost, if they did not keep schedule.  Difficulties arose in logistics, defensive support, and interference by German Panzer divisions.<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing, but don't expect alot of humour.  The movie theme is very similiar to the movie \\"Patton\\" with its historical action direction.  This movie is about a desparate attempt to establish a glorious \\"D-day\\" invasion by capture five key bridges.  \\"Men die in war\\" was the cold calculated statement, as the Generals abandoned support for the fifth bridge.  A cold cynical look at risk and lose in war.
1400031087|4.0|So much controversy about this book really!    I was intrigued to watch the entire uproar on the Oprah Show and I also heard a little about the Larry King Live episode and the Smoking Gun articles too, and though relatively late, I finally read the book!     I have to say that once the embellishments were discovered I'm glad the genre issue was corrected and that this book can still be seen on shelves - hopefully now for its positive attributes, as it has many.     Some parts stood out more than others but I found the entire book enjoyable. It's a fantastic story written in a distinctive style; the inner monologue of an addict who is in due course stronger, gaining a lot of insight and understanding regarding his circumstances. Though Frey does extremely well for himself, there is no exaggerated hero. Yes, in writing style and content, Frey is real with all his dreadful mistakes and foolishness. His story is potent, callous and soft, ruthless and tender. It definately grabs and holds your attention.    Frey makes us think twice when he repeatedly denies the 12 step recovery program and refutes the idea of addiction being a disease. He says it is a decision and that people need to take accountability for it. I continue to contemplate this notion.     Again, it is his unique style of writing that I enjoyed; when he talks about love, when he talks about the music that his roommate plays, when he comically describes the addicts devouring their steak and lobster at the party! Even those who are not addicts can relate to the desperation that is part of being human, the loneliness, the anxiety, an uncontainable need to fill the void. For those who don't deny their feelings, this book will be one about humankind and the fragility of our nature.  It's a smart balancing act of emotions that will resonate with many people.     Frey did an amazing job of staying sober and I sincerely hope he stays strong. Good on ya!    I'm off to read My Friend Leonard
1592401791|4.0|Excellent behind the scenes account of how the beatles actually recorded their music. This book is loaded with personal and tecnological information that brings to life a very interesting period in pop music. I am puzzled by some of the reviewers reactions to Emericks portrayal of Ringo and George. I think he goes to considerable length to convey to the reader the role those two actually played in the studio as compared to Lennon and McCartney. George was younger and treated as a junior partner and was definitely over shadowed by Paul and John which the  author says is likely the reason for Harrison's  general dissatisfaction with the group. He is a bit hard on George as a guitar player citing the long periods it took to get usable solos but he also credits Harrison's development as a musician producer and song writer. The other thing to keep in mind about Emericks perspective is that he was a studio employee, and for all his contributions to the Beatles music, he was never accepted into the inner Beatles circle. The fact that McCartney actually gave him the time of day and took the time to get to know him makes his positive portrayal of McCartney that much more understandable. Also interesting was Emerick's stories of how McCartney stayed late in the studio working long long hours alone just to get the bass parts perfectly. There are so many interesting anecdotes of this nature that really make this a worthwhile book.  Check it out.

B00000DHZJ|5.0|Every song is awesome!!! It is worth considering that this CD was brought out by the Hendrix family. When it was compiled, they remastered the music to how it originally sounded on the record - exactly how jimmy wanted it to sound. Almost all CDs not brought out by the family were wrongly mixed....I know this for a fact because i read it in my guitar magazine and everything in guitar mags is true! So get this CD and hear the true awesome music of legend guitar player Jimmy Hendrix.

B000GTLQXU|3.0|The movie wasn't so predictable.   <br /> <br />I was a fan of the original 'The Poseidon Adventure' film, but I wasn't really expecting much out of this remake except for some seriously improved special effects concerning the wave striking and the ship capsizing.  On that end, the movie didn't disappoint.  And once the action begins, it keeps up pretty much non-stop, which was good, because that's really all this movie had going for it.  The special effects with the ship slowly sinking were incredibly well done, and that's what really kept this movie, no pun intended, afloat. <br /> <br />The character development was seriously lacking, and it was hard for me to care one way or the other if any of the core cast made it off the ship or not.  In fact, some of the characters I was actually hoping would meet a watery fate just because their whininess and/ or stupidity was just irritating.  Maybe if there'd been more to the characters besides the obvious set up at the beginning, heroic alpha male leaders (Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell), scared stowaway (Mia Maestro), young lovers (Emmy Rossum, Mike Vogel), token single mom & child (Jacinda Barrett, Jimmy Bennett), and the token gay architect (Richard Dreyfuss), I could have empathized with their characters more.  Richard Dreyfuss I credit with uttering one of the silliest lines in the film, by the way.  \\"I'm an architect, these ships weren't designed to stay afloat upside down.\\"  That may have held more meaning if he'd said that he was a ship designer or builder, but an architect?  Sorry, but no, the two aren't interchangable.  <br /> <br />The absolute worst thing about this movie was the predictability.  It became extremely obvious as the movie progressed who would die and when.  For instance, when the Captain gets the brilliant idea to keep all those people there in the dining room, with those nice big glass windows that were underwater, you knew they were all screwed.  When Kevin Dillon's character, Lucky Larry, announces that you have to be lucky to get a name like that, you knew he was minutes away from dying.  And it just kept going, one cliche after another down to the raft that just happens to be floating right there by the ship, and the helicopters that miraculously appear as soon as the first flare is fired. <br /> <br />All my complaints aside, it's still an okay movie if you're in the mood for something doesn't require much thought, and features lots of fire, explosions, and one killer wave.
006113127X|5.0|Charles Bukowski (1920-1994) was an underground writer of poems stories, and novels who has exerted a fascination over me for many years. He is best known for his portrayals of the shabby, dingy side of Los Angeles. His reputation has grown subsequently to his death. Many of his works originally were published by a small publishing house, Black Sparrow Press which specialized in unusual writers,  A few years ago, Black Sparrow was purchased by a HarperCollins which continues to maintain Bukowski's works in print and to publish posthumous works.<br /><br />This reprint of \\"Factotum\\" was released by HarperCollins this month to capitalize on the movie version of Factotum. I read it eagerly in anticipation of seeing the movie, which premiered at independent film festivals before its commercial release.  Earlier Bukowski movies include \\"Barfly\\" (1987) and the documentary \\"Bukowski: Born into This\\" (2004).<br /><br />Factotum (1975)is Bukowski's second novel, and its main character is Bukowski's alter ego, named Henry Chinaski. The word 'factotum\\" means \\"A person having many diverse activities or responsibilities\\" or \\"a general servant\\".  These definitions, particularly the second, capture much of the spirit of the novel.  Chinaski is a young man, down and out, who has been rejected for the draft during WW II.  In short, fast-moving chapters, the novel chronicles Chinaski's search for work crossing back and forth throughout the United States.<br /><br />The novel is gritty, raw and tough. Chinaski is hardly a hero as he loses one dead-end job after another and throws away the few possible opportunities that come his way. Chinaski is solitary and anti-social.  He drinks heavily and plays the horses.  He takes up with women and generally drops them as quickly as he meets them.  He leads the life of a drifter, loner, and outsider.<br /><br />Without prelude or introduction, the book opens as Chinaski arrives \\"in New Orleans in the rain at 5\\"o'clock in the morning\\" and is quickly accosted by \\"a high yellow sitting on the porch steps swinging her legs\\".  He goes through a series of jobs and shabby hotels before embarking on a journey that takes him to Texas, Los Angeles, his hometown, New York City, Philadelphia, St Louis and, finally back to Los Angeles.  At the end, we see Chinaski, frustrated and angry fantasizing over a dancer in a burlesque house.<br /><br />Chinaski loses a litany of jobs, including working as a janitor, window washer, shipping clerk, baker's helper, assistant in a dog buscuit factory, and similar ventures. He either quits, or, more often, is fired for absenteeism, attitude, fighting, and drinking. He has affairs with a variety of women, the most prominent of whom in this book is Jan, with whom he has an on again off again relationship punctuated by alcohol, horseracing, fighting, and Jan's affairs with other men.<br /><br />Chinaski is an aspiring writer, when he is not drinking or otherwise occupied, and the book includes a scene in which a short story is accepted for publication. Writing and reflection are used, as is so often the case, as a way to understand and distance oneself from a shabby, difficult life. There are many lively, funny scenes in Factotum. Chinaski does not ask for sympathy and gives none.  The story is toughly and unapologetically told. The book gives the impression of an individual deeply down on himself and on others who sees himself as fighting and carrying on simply to live his life for what it is.<br /><br />Bukowski is a vulgar, raw author who will not appeal to everyone.  But I continue to be taken with him and with Factotum.  The book exerts a pull that I can't shake off.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanw sitting on the porch steps swinging her legs\\".

B00005JP87|3.0|Everybody in everyday life uses magic. We all use our brain power to make things disappear and reappear. We use sleight of hand and misdirection. We use this magic to get ahead, stay ahead, cheat, make a move, enhance our PR, etc. The lesson we can learn from this excellent film is that to understand our magical powers is to be all powerful. \\"The Illusionist\\" tells the story of a magician (by trade) Eisenheim who becomes embroiled in a blood feud with Crown Price Leopold over a girl.  What ensues is a battle of illusions between the two. One has the cops do all his dirty work, makes Eisenheim's show go up in a puff of smoke, and makes his girlfriend disappear. The other is forced to counter those moves using more traditional magic.<br /><br />Edward Norton stars in his second quality film this year (after \\"Down in the Valley\\") and this time is playing a role better suited to his skills.  He nails the role of Eisenheim, even if he never disappears into it. The magic scenes are wonderful. Whether movie magic was used or not, I still found myself trying to figure out how he did that. It left me yearning to learn more about the history of magic, back before audiences were desensitized to magic by Hollywood. I also appreciated the way the film reminds us that the church and magic don't get along so well (remember the Harry Potter book burnings?). The reason, of course, being that magic delivers miracles whereas preachers are left discussing them. So the church has decided to disqualify magicians from the whole miracle making game (\\"Heretics!), talk about your sore losers. The first half of the film worked better than the second half. I enjoyed watching Eisenheim dance around his haters in Vienna, using simple magic and showmanship to drive them insane. Once the consequence of that insanity comes to bear, the story slows down in the extremist. The problem is that director Neil Burger thinks he has a real rabbit up his hat, but the ending is so very inevitable (it's called \\"The Illusionist\\" after all). It does all come together in a nice little bow, but they weren't fooling me. Paul Giamatti is stellar as always, but this isn't a sexy role like he had in \\"Sideways\\" and \\"American Splendor.\\" Here he tones it down and remains hidden behind his beard.<br /><br />Eisenheim's success relies on the fact that he understands his power better than Leopold. To create a worthwhile illusion takes hard work and confidence. Leopold believed that his power was absolute, but no power is ever absolute (don't tell George Bush I said that). Illusions are just that and are far from real. It took an understanding in the human game of chess to make one person rise from the grave, another shape shift, and another fall to his knees, not magic. In other words, perception is reality. Burger thinks this movie is a magic trick, but I'm not buying it. I think he has a well made, well acted film that entertained me greatly. If he has been exposed as a phony magician, he still has me believing that he is a real film talent. ***1/2led \\"The Illusionist\\" after all).

B00004VXF2|2.0|I was surprised to see more than 50 five star reviews for this record. It was even more of a surprise to see how the bulk of those reviews actually attempt to have a meaningful discussing about the \\"music\\" on this record. It amazes me how some of the reviewers can be so full of themselves to claim they hear the great music here that Lou Reed intended, accusing the rest of the world to be tone deaf. MMM is an hours worth of feedback, nothing more. <br /> <br />True, everybody has got its own perspective to what beautiful music is, but there are limits. If this record was a serious attempt of Lou to make beautiful music it's an insult to his own and his fan's intelligence. Let's just see this album for what it is, a big F*** You to the music industry and the fans, Lou Reed's own private joke. Since a joke is often just funny once, there's only one star extra for that. <br /> <br />After reading those five star reviews I can't help but wonder, did Lou Reed calculate those reactions as well? Did he anticipate the fact that there would be people actually pretending to like this record? And if that's the case, at whose expense did mr. Reed have a bigger laugh, those of us who initially returned it in anger and later got the joke, or those of you who stroke their own ego by claiming this is their favourite record of all time and it's just sad others can't see it that way.

B000G75AE8|5.0|After almost five years since \\"God Hates Us All,\\" I was so excited to hear that a new Slayer album was coming out. I have been a huge fan of these guys for over 17 years, since I got a hold of \\"Reign in Blood\\" at the tender age of 13, which sent me running to the dictionary to look up words like \\"eviscerate.\\" Slayer's music, with its simultaneous aggression and beauty, has kept me sane through junior high, high school, college and every job I've ever had. It's especially helpful in traffic, and it's also highly effective in drowning out annoying co-workers!<br /><br />This CD reminds me most of \\"Seasons in the Abyss,\\" my all-time favorite Slayer album. There is not one weak track on it. My favorite track is \\"Jihad,\\" with \\"Cult\\" as a close second. The lyrics have to do with pretty much the same themes as always, except as with the last four albums or so, they also work in political themes as well. This music is a reflection of the messed up, violent, dangerous world that we live in, as well as an escape from those things for those who listen.<br /><br />Overall, the musicianship, lyrics and production are absolutely amazing. It's hard to believe that after all these years, Slayer keeps making such original music and has never slowed down, softened or backed down. I hope they never do! \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" is still my all-time favorite, partially for nostalgic reasons, but \\"Christ Illusion\\" is definitely up there on my list of favorites now!
B000G75AE8|5.0|Forgot about what your read of other reviews that compare this to the weak \\"Seasons on the Abyss\\". Not since \\"Hell Awaits\\" has the band been so brutal, both musically and lyrically. Dont get me wrong, there has never really been a \\"bad\\" Slayer album, but there have been some albums (\\"God Hates us All\\" and \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" that have been weaker efforts) We all know what a great job Paul did with Slayer, and I was dissapointed with his departure, but I was very excited that Dave was touring with them last time I saw them (2002) and I was surprised that he stuck around. He is brillent on this album, and so is the rest of the band. Please believe me when I tell you its brutal as hell. Some claim the band will never be like they were back in the 1980's (Show no Mercy, Haunting the Chapel EP, Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, and Hell Awaits) but that is a ridiculous statement. I understand these reviews are all a matter of opinion, but if you look at it from a musical point of view, those albums that I had mentioned above, where heavy, but a bit rawer, since the production wasn't as good then, plus the music  itself had a bit of a diffrent sound, since Trash, Death, and Black metal were all new to the 1980's. To say this album isn't as brutal or heavy, is once again a close-minded suggestion. \\"Christ Illusion\\" is a treat, and Shows that Slayer has never cared about changing times of music, espially with the birth of Nu Metal, and pop Metal. It is my favorite album of the newer material, and once again I think its as brutal as \\"Hell Awaits\\" I really get urked that people never mention that album, and always compare everything to \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" While Seasons has some great tracks, its no where near the intensity of South of Heaven or Hell Awaits. I think those are the best Slayer albums of all time, well I have to put \\"Reign in Blood\\" up there as well, cause thats just another sheer brutal album. I think Fans are going to love this one, as I did. If people keep saying this is in the league with \\"Seasons\\" and love it, those that \\"Seasons\\" like myself, is a bit weak of a Slayer release, is going to go INSANE over this release. Either way, whatever your opinion, this is easily a Five Star effort, and Metal album of the year. ENJOY!!!!!
0671799320|5.0|This is a thoroughly engrossing, still-relevant treatment of the history of oil and its effect on history.  Many of the events recounted are familiar from high school and college history courses, but in the typical linear-timeline of such studies, the interconnectedness of oil toward other major historical events is often lost.  This book puts all that in perspective, neatly tieing other technological and political events across 150 years to the rise of oil and its use in the internal combustion engine.  I strongly agree with an earlier comment on this book, \\"if you don't know the history of oil, you don't know history.\\" <br />
0345442970|5.0|Cloak of Deception is a political thriller from the Star Wars genre and gives the reader early indications of the Machiavellian manipulations of Senator Palpatine, the esteemed legislator from Naboo. It also introduces you to Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the two Jedi who are the principal heroes in the tale.<br /><br />I couldn't help but wonder how a reader would react to the book if you were picking it up for the first time and had scant knowledge of the Star Wars universe. Would you really understand Jedi? Would you have any clue as to who Darth Sidious is and what he might be up to? With the benefit of having seen the movies numerous times and being familiar with what happens down the road, I took the book to be an extremely enjoyable yarn. Plus, it was great fun to be introduced to Nute Gunray and his Trade Federation cohorts, to the new Queen Amidala of Naboo, and to Bail Antilles and other senators, not to mention Yoda, Mace Windu and the Jedi Council.<br /><br />The descriptions in the book of locations are outstanding, particularly that of Coruscant - \\"a welter of lustrous domes, knife-edged spires, and terraced superstructures that climbed to the sky.... Striations of magnetically guided sky traffic moved swiftly above the cityscape - streams of transports, air buses, taxis, and limousines, coursing between the tall spires and over the measureless chasms like schools of exotic fish.\\" Excellent stuff, particularly for readers who have visited all levels of Coruscant in their imaginations.<br /><br />The story moves along well from incident to incident, and plot twists regarding the apparent assassination attempt on Chancellor Valorum come into play near the end of the book. Captain Cohl and his band are interesting characters and will be missed.<br /><br />All in all, Cloak of Deception leads the reader through a great story and does a huge amount of groundwork in setting the stage for future chaos created by Darth Sidious.
B0000252YK|5.0|I couldn't care less what the Ozzy bandwagon jumpers (the ones who called Ozzy fans \\"devil worshippers\\" in the 1980s and who are now ultra-Ozzy fans since that beyond dumb MTV \\"reality\\" show \\"The Osbournes\\") have to say about \\"The Ultimate Sin.\\"  It's a shame this album has gotten a bad rep because, if you take the time to listen to the lyrics, it conveys some pretty deep stuff.<br /><br />Nowadays, the American media is romanticizing the 1980s and passing it on to kids born then (and afterwards) as this wonderful time to be with a president who was so lovable and jovial and an economy that was just teeming with prosperity and opportunity.<br /><br />Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br /><br />Ozzy, a British citizen, was conveying his thoughts of the ever-increasing threat of nuclear war between the then-two superpowers - the U.S. and The Soviet Union (Russia).  The world was treated to back and forth barbs between the two countries and people hoped such a threat would never come to fruition.<br /><br />To me, \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" is an album-long political statement more than a glam-metal album (although I would never equate Ozzy with \\"glam\\" metal!).  Perhaps that's the reason why so many people are turned off by it.  The sound is way more mainstream than \\"Bark At the Moon,\\" \\"Diary of a Madman\\" and \\"Blizzard of Ozz,\\" make no mistake about that.  But the tunes are pretty deep and, as with all of Ozzy's earlier solo material (from \\"Blizzard ...\\" to \\"No More Tears\\"), I can simply put this in the CD player and listen from start to finish without skipping over any songs.<br /><br />My faves here are \\"Killer of Giants\\" and the title track (which positively rocks!).<br /><br />I've been an Ozzy fan since the '80s, in a time when those TV preachers, the P.M.R.C., and assorted misfits were crucifying Ozzy on a daily basis for doing nothing more than being himself.  He was constantly targeted because he challenged peoples' views and rocked hard while doing it.  Although it irks me to see him so mainstream today, I still respect him and will love his music until the day I die.  - Donna Di Giacomoit.

After the first video \\"Pon De Replay\\" oh, she had me... I was S.O.L.D. SOLD... but then, saw her live... A little troubling... Saw her live again, still, troubling...

Point blank... maybe on a LUCKY DAY she is able to pull off a fine Live performance... but for the MOST part, all Studio... and Ok, the Studio albums may be HOT... May be all that, but in my opinion... Record Labels should be made to do their job and stop throwing scraps at us w/pretty faces... I give her props because the Tracks are Nice... on the Radio and in your Car via CD and at the Club... but face to face, live tv, concert... Um, No. Absolutely Not. And in my personal opinion... a fan of Mary J, Aaliyah (RIP), Janet, Toni Braxton, newcomer Keyshia Cole, Christina Aguilera, Mariah, all those who have paved and Earned their way... not to \\"compare\\" her but If u cannot recreate (at least your OWN) music w/an awesome LIVE EXPERIENCE... You're not a true artist and u don't have True talent... that's my honest opinion... And hey - giving the benefit of doubt, if u Suck on the CD AND Suck live and we still buy u... then hey, we must like you, and it's all good... suck away... but if u sound GREAT on the CD, awesome over loud speakers in the club - and then you just totally suck and can't move the audience to save your life LIVE, um... yeah that's a tad bit of a problem for me... There should be some form of Standard for these labels... It's all about a quick buck and a dream... Put some time into these people... Do some research... Dig DEEP to the people uput on stage and on these cd covers... Rihanna has hope, but at this point... that's all she's got... but hey I guess she's making money, the labels making money, and you're Spending Yours on half hearted deal - so what the hell, it's all good...................................... right?????
B000FVBLEI|3.0|Anyone who has listend to previous efforts from All That Remains knows that they concentrated mostly on playing music and not much else.  Every song seemed like it was written around the music and had a lot of depth in it.  The singer didn't feel the need to be like everybody else and use clean vocals all the time.  But this album all the songs are around 3 and a half minutes long, leaving no time for anything except to write radio friendly metal.  The clean vocals are way overdone and almost every song has them. it is very annoying to hear clean vocals in EVERY chorus.  He isn't even that good of a singer, his clean vocals only work in small doses.    <br /> <br />Gone are the day of them just jamming out.  You could hear how much fun they were having then.  This record just seems like they just wrote a bunch of quick ditties so they could get a little more popular.   <br /> <br />There are some good points in here though.  Occasionly, he will do some death metal grunts and it sounds great.  The guitar solos are pretty good the drumming is decent.  The songs are just boring though.  All in all, it's not a terrible album but when compared to previous albums it is.  And taken on it's own, it just sounds like everyone else, very bland.  With so many bands releasing top notch albums this year (lamb of god, iron maiden, mastodon, satyricon, decapitated, napalm death, vader), there is really no need to ever pay attention to this album again.  oh well.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Is Noir making a comeback? I mean there's been some really great Noir coming out in the last couple of years. Brick, which seems to be of the more classical style of Noir, but we've also had Sin City, and the upcoming Black Dahlia, along with Soderbergh's Good German.  <br />When I first saw previews for this film I was entranced, the camera shots, style, jargon, and characters were spot on. Even when I began to realize from trailers that this was a high school Noir I didn't harbor any reservations. I don't quite know how to describe the genuis of the film, but it takes a somewhat novel if not seemingly misguided idea and twists it into one of the greatest Noir detective stories I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.  <br />Not only that, but a seemingly incomprehensible story line is made so elementary that a grade schooler could follow it. There isn't much that isn't great about this movie, brilliantly over the top, and strategically layed out, this, in my opinion could be the best movie of 2006.

0143036742|5.0|Ms. Lewycka's first book debuted to rave reviews in London, Paris, New York, and all points in between.  Critics have described the book as funny, charming, ingenious, astonishing, and poignant.  The characters are memorable, the plot unusual and unpredictable.<br /><br />Nikolai Mayevskyj is 84-years old, a retired draftsman from a tractor factory who emigrated to U.K. from the Ukraine.  The feisty widower occupies his agile mind by writing a book on the impact tractors had on Ukrainian society.  Until her death, his<br /><br />wife Ludmilla gardened, canned fruits and vegetables, saved her money, and stored food against the time her family might go hungry.  Life is good in England, but the memory of suffering and starvation in Ukraina haunts them.  Daughters Vera and Nadia are at odds, spending much of their time and energy arguing over dividing Ludmilla's estate, until a 36-year old Ukrainian femme fatale latches onto their fragile, elderly father.<br /><br />Valentina is buxom, blonde haired, and determined to reap whatever harvests possible in the West.  She wants money, marriage, vehicles, status and will do whatever it takes to achieve her goals.  Valentina is seductive, manipulative, destructive, and cruel, but oddly endearing as she herds Nikolei towards the altar.  Among the many men she romances, he's the only one willing to marry her.  Vera and Nadia combine forces to rescue their father from Valentina's physical abuse and financial excesses.<br /><br />Ms. Lewycka's novel is neither farce nor tragedy.  It's a social commentary and testament to the human struggle to survive Stalinist Russia.  Vera and Nadia remember a Ukrainian past better left unspoken.  Nikolai shares a rich legacy through his manuscript.  With keen intelligence and determination the Mayevskyjs survived Stalin and starvation, but will they survive Valentina's ruthless machinations?
0571202284|5.0|this book as the title says runs over the princibles and methods of animation. in this book YOU DO NOT LEARN HOW TO DRAW!!! you only learn how to animate, but what you learn on the animation will be infintely useful.richard kind of writes a auto biography the first 40 pages which tells about his journey through animation. it's exciting but the meat of the book is after that. how much he goes into detail in the animations is incredible. he talks about important cartoon techniques such as anticipation,action, reaction. also he talks about weight to make your characters look fat pick up heavy objects etc. like i said before you do not learn how to draw ,but you learn how to animate well. if you want to put these animation skills to the test i suggest picking up preston blair's cartoon animation <br />(the one made in 1994)  I suggest reading throught it first then getting a sketch book and drawing these animations. like i said before pick this up with preston blair's book and you'll be a good animator in no time.
B00006GEXQ|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I thought it was going to be one of those schmaltzy variations of \\"his heart grew three sizes that day, thanks to the magical, transformative power of a child's luuuuuuuv\\".  Okay, the child, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) has a lot to do with it, but the protagonist, Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) develops realistically and not radically.  Even at the end, Will is still not the kind of guy who will adopt five orphans and get a 9-5 job.  Still, he, a proudly self-proclaimed \\"island\\" among men, makes genuine connections with other, isolated people and is happier for it. <br /> <br />This is a movie stuffed full of \\"ideas\\", and they're handled well.  Modern isolation and the veneration of pointless consumerism and sloth.  Children--especially boys--who lack male role models.  Depression and its effect on the family, especially children.  What it means to fit in, what it means to stand out, and the price an individual pays either way.  The serious issues are given appropriate weight, but this is not a depressing movie.  There are plenty of laughs too: some sight gags, some verbal. <br /> <br />Toni Collette is fabulous as usual, and Natalia Tena does well with a small and unfortunately underused role.  Hugh Grant was terrific--this is his best work to date--and I look forward to seeing more of Nicholas Hoult. <br />

B0000AYL16|5.0|This is my all-time favorite album, as I wore out the grooves in 1976 by playing it so much.  I just saw Frampton in concert last month and felt like I was in a time warp.  He looks and sounds as great as he did 30 years ago.  Anyway, I most certainly had to update from vinyl to CD and purchased the anniversary set.  Nowhere in the description did it say that it was only in SACD format.  Upon receipt of the set, I couldn't wait to pop it into the CD player, but these CDs will not play on my player, since it is over 10 years old.  I have no choice but to return it and get the CD without the SACD format, but then it is not the anniversary edition.  I was disappointed that I did not know that by reading the description prior to my purchase.
B00005LC4B|4.0|In this vicious remake of the 1962 classic starring Gregory Peck as Sam Bowden & Robert Mitchum as Max Cady, Martin Scorsese directed Robert De Niro as tatooted pyschopath Max Cady & Nick Nolte as Lawyer Sam Bowden whom him & his family are preyed upon by Cady, This as creepy as the movies get, terrifying shocker, De Niro is sadistically terrific, a human monster. If want a great suspense Thriller, see \\"Cape Fear\\" It's the best there is
B000066NW0|4.0|Teenager pop/rocker: Avril Lavigne made her debut in the Winter of 2002. At just over sixteen, this multi-talented musician set a new bar to pop/rock. In numerous MTV interviews, Lavigne declared her originality in her music with lyrics dealing mostly with reltionships. Avril's sound is exactly what she declared; one all her own with very heartfelt words. Her band is a typical rhythm section, but they are accompanied by keyboards, strings, synthisizers, and numerous effects. The songs themselves have a standard IV-V-I progression, but they sound so different then one would expect this rocker to perform. She has a decent vocal range and knows how to create intriguing melody lines with her voice. LET GO is a remarkable product for someone at Avril's age. The record landed her tons of airplay, promotional and soundtrack spots. Avril also was given a spot in a MTV Metallica Tribute Concert, performing her rendetion of \\"Fuel\\". LET GO is a very unique piece of work, and one any music fan should hear.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include:  <br />\\"Loosing Grip\\" <br />\\"Complicated\\" <br />\\"Sk8er Boi\\" <br />\\"Mobile\\" <br />\\"In My World\\" <br />\\"Nobody's Fool\\"
B0002W18MU|5.0|Cash's final album is beautifully heartbreaking.  I especially love \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" and \\"If You Could Read My Mind.\\"  I know it's a cover, but the way he does it is devestating.
079073804X|3.0|There is no doubt this film had it's moments when it was first released to the public in 1973 but the shock value has gone way down with time; and with the advent of the internet and advances in science this is nothing more then gory fun with the scare factor pushed up a notch or two.  What fuels this film is the supposed fact that it was \\"based on a true story.\\"  Well, if one does the research and reads the account thoroughly one will see many doubters including priests which would claim that the boy in question wasn't exactly possessed in the sense of the word.  There is a brilliant expose about the whole thing written by a journalist who actually tracked the boy (now a man) down and tried to interview him but he refused to co-operate.  Many of the phenomena that took place during his so called possession were easily explained away coupled with the fact the boy was quite the prankster.<br /><br />The Exorcist is a great story which will affect you for a brief time mainly because the location where all the story takes place is in a house thus suggesting that this could happen to your family.  It uses psychology to make its mark and it succeeds quite well.  Knock offs after knock offs have tried to capitalize on this plotline but none have come close.  Part II was a joke, Part III a bore and the prequels while interesting hardly delivered.  On its own Possession/exorcism is quite an interesting topic but if this is an irrefutable phenomenon why haven't we seen a genuine case being reported about recently.  Sure there are dozens of books about like \\"Hostage to the Devil\\"  \\"True accounts of Exorcism\\" and alike but upon reading all these one gets merely a third hand account of things.  20/20 had presented an alleged exorcism on camera but one could tell the girl in question was faking it.  She would often smile at the camera when she thought she was in the clear.  A book entitled \\"Exorcisms, expelling demons in the land of plenty\\" reports that despite witnessing over fifty exorcisms, the author can undoubtedly claim there was nothing supernatural about any of them.  Another thing one has to ask, is this the best the devil can do?  Why not take over an entire nation and get world war III going?<br /><br />Upon viewing the film again I started to realize how slow it was, how humorous some of the lines were and how absurd it all was.  Neither the book nor the film explains why Regan becomes possessed, how does a spirit get from Iraq to Washington anyway, did it want to see the sites and needed a body to inhabit?<br /><br />When has peeing on a carpet become scary?<br /><br />Possessed or not if one turns ones head around that is it, game over.  Profanity?  Have you checked out cable TV lately?<br /><br />In the end, the movie does make you think but you should be more afraid of your imagination for that is what the film truly targets afterwards.  For those who believe without a doubt, such things are true then take comfort that there are forces to combat them.  Bladdy has written a great story but don't' forget he also had to promote his book and film in the end and thus used anything he could find to do so.  When he read about the 1949 case and got his inspiration it provided an excellent springboard for him.  Personally I would categorize Possession/exorcism under the same vane as I do Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.  My out of the blue theory is that, possession is like another mental disorder, one believes they have been invaded by spirits thus when the ritual is performed one believes they have been cured; it is all in the Mind.<br /><br />A+ due to the fact it's a classic I would rate it B- today.y exorcisms, the author can undoubtedly claim there was nothing supernatural about any of them.

B000G759LW|5.0|\\"Back To Basics\\" is my favorite CD released so far this year.  It pays omage to the 20s, 30s, and 40s, while sounding modern at the same time.  Even though the 2 disc set might sound a bit much, there's not a dud among the tracks, in my opinion.  Christina's voice sounds better than ever and this album makes it even clearer that she is the premiere vocalist of my generation.  The upbeat songs are fun, catchy, and soulful, while the ballads are dramatic, heartfelt, and emotional.  The most powerful among them is \\"Mercy On Me.\\"  I think that this is Christina's best vocal ever. <br /> <br />I think this CD is Christina's best work yet.  Her vocals are amazing and the songs are strong.  If you like Christina then you won't be dissappointed.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|Wow, did this \\"film\\" stink! Talk about dissapointing. Sure as sheer otaku self-gratification material I'm sure it does its job; a sort of computer-generated, Japanese, \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" with swords and motorcycles. Unfortunately, the plot is just about as nonexistant as those videos are known for as well.<br /><br />The entire thing plays like a series of in-game cinema cut-scenes that were roughly spliced together in an attempt to make a movie. Too bad story and character development usually happen between such cut-scenes, as woefully, there is no character to be found at all. Aside from maybe 2 minutes of (utterly senseless) exposition here and there, the entire thing is almost non-stop over-the-top action.<br /><br />And I don't mean in a good way, it actually got to a point where I was getting so bored during the action sequences that I considered just shutting the damn thing off to see what was on the Sci-Fi channel. Now THAT's bad.<br /><br />Now I'm a diehard fan. I'm the film's target audience. I spent the entire first week after the game's stateside release practiclly without nourishment, rest, or bladder relief, and loved every minute of it. Why? Because it was a beautifully inspiring work of art, with heart and character and tragedy, and above all, emotion.<br /><br />FF: The Spirits Within had more depth than this film, and I would gladly watch it again, Advent children on the other hand... damn, I'm glad it was a rental.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Spielberg deserves warm congratulations for engaging in such a difficult and misunderstood subject such as terrorism and \\"Munich\\" brings the mark of a genius in his prime. The film has an excellent plot and very good tricks on the way which make it a fine thriller, but also tries to give a very personal and human view of the grave problem of terrorism and how this new kind of warfare eats away the souls of friends and enemies alike. Of course he does not avoid to follow mainly the Israeli view of the subject but through an encounter by chance he presents also the arguments of the \\"other side of the hill\\". The final closing picture which focuses on the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center as they were in the 70s, is an indirect but stark reminder to the American people that Israel's long war against \\"terrorism\\" has now become their war also.
B00005JOYM|5.0|This is the 5th anniversary of 9/11, and a slew of motion pictures have been released to commemorate that fateful day. But the best of the bunch is World Trade Center, a view of 9/11 from Ground Zero, where several NY police officers become trapped in the wreckage of the Twin Towers. The camera switches back and forth from scenes with the two trapped officers (played very well by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena) to scenes with the families. <br /> <br />There is also a beautiful scene where a retired Marine officer from Wisconsin answers the call of God on his life and heads to Ground Zero to aid and assist in the rescue of trapped civilians and workers. <br /> <br />The movie is very hard to watch at times, and it will bring tears to your eyes. But it is a movie experience you will not want to miss. A truly inspiring story. Thumbs Up!!!
B000F7CMRM|2.0|Although I like Clooney's and Damon's acting, this film left me with the impression that I lost two hours watching it without gaining anything valuable. The complex politics of the oil industries and the connections with corrupted Middle East governments is a common secret today as are the roots of islamic terrorism, but this movie simply could not produce something new and strong enough to catch the attention, with the exception of some very brutal scenes indeed.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|Review Disclaimer:  This review is for the Theatrical release of this movie; I have not viewed the DVD.<br /><br />I have to tell you, this was the worst movie I have ever seen, second only after maybe, Criminal Law, with Gary Oldman, and Kevin Bacon.  Okay, this one was worse, now that I think about it.<br /><br />I saw this one in the theaters about 17 or 18 years ago.  I think I remember sneaking into it, or going in quite unwilling, but it was the only movie starting at the time I was there.<br /><br />I began watching, and it seemed like it was a few minutes into the movie, and no advertisements ran.  I watched, as some characters came onto the screen, and weird gibberish came out of the speakers.  I had heard it was a really strange movie, so this didn't put me off, ...yet.  But then I started seeing weird things, like smoke suddenly appearing, than being sucked up, and people walking sideways, and backwards.  Well, I think you're beginning to catch on.  The film was running backwards, or something.  I'm still not sure.  So, what's the big deal, you ask?  Read on.<br /><br />HERE'S THE KICKER!!!!  There were about 20 people in the audience, and nobody, not one person realized what the problem was, until about 3 - 5 minutes into the film!  I'm not kidding!  It was the most bizarre theater experience I've ever had!  Finally I stood up, just as one or two other folks were standing up to go complain.<br /><br />Well, I didn't return to the movie.  It was like some kind of sign, telling me to leave the movie theater.  I think I asked to go see another film instead, and never looked back.<br /><br />This is a true story.  I'm not kidding!  This happened in the area of South San Francisco, in the Bay Area, San Francisco, sometime around 1987 or 1988.<br /><br />MC White said:  Backwards smoke and gibberish is a message from above; leave the theater!

B00003CXAE|5.0|we LOVE this movie! my kids love the songs and the \\"funny hair\\" on the guys; i think parental discretion is advised, due to mature subject matter: unwanted pregancy, premarital sex, underage smoking and drinking, illegal racing, etc. did i say this movie is good for kids? most of that content goes right over my kids heads, however, i do keep my ears and eyes open to signs that they are picking up on these themes. still, it's amazing to see the scope of talent in John Travolta, and we did enjoy the actors' commentary at the end! my, how we age!!

B0000AMRJC|5.0|Hello, my name is JOhn CHaret. As you all know, back in 2004 I wrote a bad review of this movie for no reason whatsoever. I learned by the september of that year that you do not need to have sympathetic characters for a movie. Of course, this is a romanticized gangster epic so you're allowed to. I did root for Al Pacino's character but only as an action hero. While you do not root for them as human beings like you did with The Godfather movies, this does make a great action picture. Although If it was meant to be where you root for the criminal as an action hero, they could have made this 90 something minutes or 2 hours like Howard Hawks 1932 original, which was about Al Capone. I do not hate the 1980's like I said in the past reviews or any other ones, I was seriously just bluffing. The time I wrote that bad review of this movie, I was still struggling to find my voice as a film buff. In the September of that year I found it, and I changed my mind and thought this was a great action picture. I took back what I said about the decade as well. Every decade is great and has its shares of ups and downs. Anyway this is a brilliant film.
B000GYI32M|2.0|I'm just wondering what to do with my Season 1 and 2 DVDS ...<br /><br />This Third Season started well till the 7th episode, after that you say \\"What the hell is that?\\", dont need to mention the last episode ... O.C. is over ! I won't buy it at all ! They've ruined the show, you can bet that the 4th season will be the last ... thats a shame cause it used to be my favorite show!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Once I've bought this CD I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Mark and Emmylou's voices complement each other perfectly. Rich music guitar riffs and jammin' tunes. You won't be disappointed and I'm not normally a 'country fan', but I love this!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Having everything crammed into a little box is extremely convenient. Each DVD case features a cool picture. The amount of special features is astounding, and none of the critics hold back (many people commenting the movie actually insult the third one).
B000007WQB|5.0|This 3 CD Set is wonderful. With old songs and Duet with today singers really make this Set worth having. Just kick back and enjoy.  What's not to like with Dionne Warwick and the songs of Bacharach & David?<br /><br />This would make a great gift for those who enjoy good music and wonderful written songs.
B000G75AE8|3.0|When I realized this album was finally out I giggled like a schoolgirl with glee, and had it out of the plastic before I made it to the door of the store. Nothing makes your day like getting your hands on a copy of a new Slayer album. But so far, I'd have to say I'm mildly disappointed with this effort from Slayer. First thought was \\"...this sounds kind of like Divine Intervention...\\" so I figured it may someday be collecting dust just like that disc. <br /> <br />But after another couple listens, it's growing on me, a little bit. The music is good, but the lyrics are booooring. Please, could Slayer GIVE US A BREAK WITH THE INFANTILE WHINING ABOUT RELIGION AND JESUS? One song per album, fine. Two songs, ok. But nearly a whole album of this incessant carping about \\"hail satan\\" and \\"666\\" and \\"religion sucks\\" and \\"jesus is a farce\\" is enough to make me want to put this out on my coffee table as a novelty devil-worship drink coaster. The lyrical diversity of Diabolus in Musica and past albums was way better. I think King needs to take a chill pill on the whole religion/satan/blasphemey thing. I'm getting this image of some snot-faced little 12-year old screaming obscenities about religion as loudly and irritatingly as possible just to get a rise out of his parents. That is, of course, until they give him a good backhand. It's just getting a little old, and they could benefit from a little more variety.  <br /> <br />Each release takes some getting used to for me - I like them all in their own unique ways, but Divine Intervention hasn't been in the CD player for years, and I hope this one doesn't end up right next to it soon because of the lack of lyrical creativity. <br />
B000068TPN|4.0|This is an excellent movie if you like war flicks. It made me angry being from the Vietnam generation also. It shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men. The acting from all the cast was top class. I highly recommend this movie. It may be slow at first, but the action later is amazing.
B0007PALRU|5.0|I always enjoy watching this movie over and over again. This movie makes you think about what we as a whole have done to the atmosphere due to our selfish ways.

B000G759LW|5.0|I've always admired Christina's vocal talent, but I was never especially impressed with her music.  Until now, that is.  \\"Back to Basics\\" is a concept album that showcases more than just Christina's awesome voice - she co-wrote most of the tracks.  I was *very* impressed by the lyrical content on this CD; it's far and away better than most currrent pop music.  Christina has a lot of fun on \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and pays homage to some of my favorite artists on \\"Back in the Day\\".  But she also manages to bare her heart and soul, most notably on tracks like \\"Understand\\" (which is my favorite) and \\"The Right Man\\".   <br /> <br />Disc 1 has more of a hip-hop influence than Disc 2, which is more of a throwback to the music of \\"back in the day\\" ('40s, '50s, etc.).  I personally think that Disc 2 has fewer hits than misses compared to Disc 1, but overall, it's still a great listen.   <br /> <br />I applaud Christina for her lyrics, powerful vocals, and artistry on \\"Back to Basics\\".  It's an ambitious, fun, and at times insightful album that announces Christina's transition from \\"pop princess\\" to \\"accomplished artist\\".  You go, girl!
B000ESSTL0|4.0|I don't really mind having to conduct research before deciding which version of a CD to purchase, but I suspect that I am in the minority. So I'll pass on what I learned after doing some reading and settling on the SACD UK import version of this release:    1. First, be aware that there are two versions of this release - both have a CD and a DVD, but only the UK import has a SACD 5.1 surround sound layer on the CD.  2. The DVD has a short film about the band at the time of the release of Violator. It also has the album in 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS surround. There is no DVD audio on either the US or the UK version. There are a few additional music tracks on the DVD.  3. I went for the UK import because the high resolution (SACD) will always sound best. I cannot say whether it is a noticeable difference from the DTS or Dolby Digital, as the DVD will not play on my Pioneer DVD player. It is, you see, in PAL and not NTSC format. I was, however, able to view the film on my computer, and play the extra music tracks which are also on the DVD. There are no music videos. In my opinion, the additional music was OK, but probably only of real interest to the die hard fan.     The sound on the SACD is simply stunning. If enough people had actually heard the difference between SACD and CD the way that this issue sounds different from the original CD (which sounds pretty good) I believe that the format would have done better. The sound is the reason for shelling out the big bucks for this reissue. From what I have heard in the DTS format in the past, I am sure that the US DTS or even Dolby Digital will sound excellent, if you have the proper equipment. If you have a SACD player, I would recommend the SACD version, because it is the best. Even if you cannot play the DVD on your television, you can probably watch it on your computer. And it's only worth about a single viewing. Believe me, you will listen to the SACD many times.    If you do not have the proper 5.1 surround equipment(SACD, Dolby Digital or DTS), give this a miss. It is too expensive, and you will not notice enough of a difference listening to the stereo CD layer.    It is a shame that the recording industry continues to sabotage the SACD/DVD Audio formats. It's confusing, and it need not be as bad as it is. There was no good reason not to have the hybrid SACD layer on the US version. It is begining to look as though the SACD format will become a European favorite, and DVD-Audio, such as it is, will be the \\"hi resolution\\" format of choice in the US, at least for pop music. The absence of either high resolution format on the US version of this reissue forces me to recommend the UK import, even if it does cost more.
B000009PNY|1.0|If you are a self-loathing manic depressive who wears pointy shoes and black fingernail polish then you probably own this already, the 80's were a horrible decade for music and trying to revive it with newer bands is equally bad.
6305897786|2.0|Beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that.  Was real disappointed by 9th Gate.  This film is tepid, there is none of the satanic intensity/ambiance that you find in 'Rosemary's Baby' It's too Hollywood, surprisingly, considering the maverick presence of Depp/Polanski. Film opens well, with a suicide and Depp's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence, but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere.  Exorcist 3, which I was equally disappointed in, at least was more satanic.  I won't spoil anything for those who do want to see it, but the showdown scene between Depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed.  Emmanuelle Seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a Demona. And the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least.  This film could have been great but Polanski dropped the ball, considering he was the producer/director/co-screenwriter, and the film fails in all three areas. It's not horrible, so I give it 2 stars.  But don't buy this film, rent it only.  Buy Angel Heart instead.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|Jonathan Larson was an incredible talent, as is evident in the stirring melodies he presented to us in \\"Rent.\\"  However, this late-1980's tale of struggling Bohemians is ultimately unsatisfying.  Though a number of the characters must face grave difficulties, including addiction and AIDS, it is hard to feel for the \\"struggle\\" of those who are provided free residence and spend much of their time living irresponsibly.  The turnabout of now having to owe and entire year's rent is startling, but, on the other hand, I know very few people who have the luxury of living for free, or then simply deciding they will continue to live for free if the rules suddenly change.  On top of this, more than a couple of comments suggest that life in New York can't possibly get more \\"sh***y\\" than \\"today\\" (late 1980's), and it makes one wonder what our characters would have thought of a city being attacked by terrorists, destroying the World Trade Center and killing 3,000 people.  With so much suffering going on in the world, it is hard to feel sorry for a group of Bohemians whose main concern is seeking some kind of fellowship as they lead a reckless (and often dangerous) lifestyle with no moral restrictions.   <br />Time is indeed precious, and I appreciate Jonathan Larson's astonishing musical talent, but I would have preferred to spend these two hours with another set of characters.  I have better things to do with my own 525,600 minutes.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|Warner's Poseidon is less of a movie and more of an experiment in cinema as if Wolfgang Petersen tried to see if a film could be carried only by the authentic emotions of actors in peril. Unencumbered by character development or questions of who to follow, who lives or who dies, or which way to go (one of the most repeated sentiments is \\"stay here and we die!\\") Poseidon is filmed somewhat incredibly in sequence, with the actors doing their own stunts on gigantic sets.  Petersen and DP John Seale shoot with multiple hand-held cameras striving to capture actual anxiety in the performers documentary style.    The result is... OK. Part of the problem is the mix of live action and visual effects. Sure the actors are experiencing on-set peril (wearing safety harnesses), but the film is so chock-full of effects work, from the 99% computer-generated opening shot to the numerous digital set extensions, that we become inured to the spectacle assuming everything was probably shot bluescreen. Nor does the marketing help. In a good DVD extra, Petersen and the actors talk about the harrowing experience of being on set. But their message has already been dulled by the segment's title, \\"Ship on a stage,\\" which conjures images of actors drinking Evian in trailers between takes.    The performances also suffer from perhaps too big a dose of reality. Amazingly, that really is Josh Lucas swimming under a pool of fire. But Lucas' determined expression is the kind of mask we put on when trying to accomplish a task under stress. By putting his actors in difficult situations, Petersen has stripped away actor-y performances to reveal yet another level of performance never getting to primal emotion.    Finally, Petersen can't get around the central emotional requirements of mainstream filmmaking. Petersen sets us up to believe that this is going to be a gritty keep moving-or-die drama. Yet, the characters have to pause and reflect when one of their group dies--even though we know that the water is rising quickly around them. These kind of concessions disrupt any attempt by Petersen to capture authentic terror.    Poseidon is an intriguing experiment, a sort of big budget reality show in which not-quite bankable actors do their own stunts on gigantic soundstages. This Circus of the Stars-meets-Survivor is a taut, brisk watch forsaking even the expected denouement. But it its desire to strip away the conventions of the genre and distill film to the thinnest of narrative threads, Poseidon also does away with the reason we watch these films in the first place.
B000063DHK|5.0|Two words best describes what we have here, Their Best!!!!<br /><br />This live offering has everything a Maiden fan could want, power, passion and pain along with the glory of the band flying high on the road following the massive success of the Powerslave release. This release contains old school Maiden and the song selection is top notch. I actually saw this tour back in 85 and I have fond memories (from what I can remember!) of this show. From the get go it storms out all guns blazing and never looks back. Everybody's in fine form and it shows up here with an energy that just oozes out of your speakers.<br /><br />Yup it's all here and it's all good.<br /><br />I love it!!
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is some of John Cleese's best work! Cleese plays Basil Fawlty: a singularly inhospitable manager of a small hotel. He takes bad customer service to the ridiculous extreme. It is uproariously funny to watch the terrible mess he causes for himself. The good writing, well designed cast of characters, snappy timing, and witty dialogue had me hooked from the first episode. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Monty Python's Flying Circus, British humour, or just laughing in general!
B000GRUMPU|3.0|Well, considering the rumored amount of money that went into the production of this film, I expected something really engaging.  It is lackluster in many respects, especially (as is often quoted) the less-than-stellar character development.  Each \\"lead\\" is given one or two lines of throw-away dialogue in the beginning of the movie to encapsulate who they are and then...BAM, rogue wave!  I guess since many of us as movie-goers know what is going to happen anyway, the producing team figured they might as well get into the action quickly.<br /><br />That aside, I was disturbed by what seemed like a lack of compassion between these characters.  It seemed that every man was for himself.  Religion played prominently in the original film.  Here, it is reduced to a young girl's relationship to the crucifix she wears around her neck.  The characters represented in this film are more a cross-section of our typical modern-day thoughts of self-promotion and survival as opposed to Gene Hackman's character motivating and imploring all to join him to get to safety in the original.<br /><br />I don't discount that there were well-crafted scenes in this film, but it was effects-heavy and didn't have any heart.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|Considering the unwatchable DREK coming out of Hollywood lately, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I would have paid to see it at a theatre, but bad marketing made it appear to be yet another non-stop action, shoot-em-up, so I passed. Did catch it on HBO. <br /> <br />This is a movie that married people with relate to the most. The other poster who said she and her husband's laughter was probably embarassing the teenagers in the audience could easily identify with the funny bickerings of the no-longer newly-weds. <br /> <br />Of course there are big problems with editing and questionable scenes and yes, no one can outrun machine gun bullets!!! But the chemistry between these two actors was immediately apparent. No one can miss how smitten Brad is with Angelina. And what was with the baby scene at the neighbor's house? That is kind of true to their personal lives.  <br /> <br />Yes, Angelina's lips are way too large and sometimes that's all you see, but her character was self-assured, confident, smart and take no B.S. off anyone. Very refreshing coming from Hollywood which depicts women as wusses who turn their ankles in nearly every chase scene and must be carried out by the hero! <br /> <br />I hated the ending. It seemed to be improvised and I couldn't tell what Brad Pitt mouthed at the end. If anyone knows, please post it. Watched it 10 times, can't figure it out.
B00005JP87|4.0|Neil Burger's \\"The Illusionist\\" is an elegantly civilized entertainment that just barely misses the transition into a masterpiece. But since elegantly civilized entertainments are in short supply these days, I won't be too hard on it. With the magnificent help of cinematographer Dick Pope and production designer Ondrej Nekvasil, Burger crafts a somber, rich and romantic mystery based on Steven Millhauser's short story about Eisenheim, a brilliant magician in 1900 Vienna, who tries to reclaim Sophie, his aristocratic, long-lost love. However, the treacherous Crown Prince Leopold wants Sophie as his consort, and orders the assiduous Chief Inspector Uhl to rid the empire of Eisenheim, by any means possible. What follows is a compelling cat-and-mouse game that touches on the eternal mysteries of existence, and at its best leaves the audience truly breathless with its artful legerdemain. Unfortunately, the story's denouement, while clever, is more prosaic than what Burger led us to expect. But the film's sheer craftsmanship makes it more than worth seeing, particularly since the stars are Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, two actors who improve any film simply by virtue of appearing in it. Norton, an actor whose eyes reflect unplumbed depths in every role he plays, is the perfect choice for Eisenheim. Giamatti, famous for playing neurotics and boy-men, here plays a character of cool, cerebral intelligence, and does so with commanding presence and voice. Their face-offs are the best part of the movie, and they play them like fencing masters, with elegance and flourish. As Sophie, Jessica Biel is sensuously lovely and dewy-fresh, which is exactly what she needs to be. As Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell smolders with dark menace, a worthy inheritor of the mantle of the late Oliver Reed. Fans of historical romance and supernatural mystery will find \\"The Illusionist\\" a memorable, if not quite unforgettable, example of both genres.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I honestly don't think I can put into words how great this album truly is. Its truly one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. Although, it took me awhile to feel that way. At the Drive In takes awhile to set in, Omars voice is at first a bit disrupting and rough around the edges, but you gradually grow to love it, as you do with everything else about this band. At the Drive In is in your face with funky and crazy riffs that are accompanied with Omar's unique voice. You really can't describe their sound, you just have to experience it for yourself. But let me tell you, they are one of the most creative and unique bands I've ever experienced. They are truly one of the most influential bands of the post/hardcore punk scene. Many bands have been influenced by ATDI that are popular today. And this album delivers what ATDI do best, and thats rock your socks off. And you keep coming back to get your socks rocked off again and again. Its raw, emotional, intense and emotional. I love the unique guitar riffs and sounds the band produces. Its a very complex album, you hear piano's in some songs, and other little atmospheric effects are littered throughout.<br /><br />This is by far the strongest ATDI album. 2nd in my book would probably be Vaya, which has some great tracks on it. Its too bad that this is the last ATDI album, it would of been nice to see where these guys could have gone had they stayed togeather. Altough you now have 3/5ths of them in the Mars Volta. While The Mars Volta and Sparta are great bands in their own right, they have branched off into different directions and don't quite match the energy and magic that makes up ATDI. Some bands just have that chemistry, that cohesive nature too them that makes them something special. ATDI had this and this album epitomizes what makes them great.<br /><br />Lyrically, this album is great. Some of the lyrics are out there and funky, like: \\"Yes this is the campaign slithered entrails in the cargo bay, A neutered is the vastness Hallow vacuum check the Oxygen tanks.\\" How can you not love lyrics like that? The lyrics fit perfectly with the style of the music being played.<br /><br />There is really not a bad song on the album, Enfilade is one of my favorites, as is One Armed Scissor and Quarantined. But the real gem of this cd for me is Non-Zero Possibility. Its easily one of the most amazing and songs I've ever heard. I can't get enough of it. Its different from most of the tracks on the album and it sounds almost like a pre-Mars Volta song. Sometimes I use that song to fall asleep, or at least listen too it right before I go to sleep, and has very moody atmosphere and almost puts you in a trance. Truly unbelievable.

B000002IAZ|5.0|A replica of the album, which I still own but can't enjoy without a turntable.  Definitely one of the late 60's best albums/cd's.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I love A Perfect Circle, and I actually prefer them over Tool (love tool, just apc more). Mer De Noms was about as good as you can get for a debut album. And the fact that it sounded so much different than anything Tool had ever done made me just love it. Could this album reach the level of greatness that Mer De Noms had? Let me tell you that it does. In fact, dare I say it might just be a better album. Thirteenth Step is a powerful, moving and haunting piece of work. Maynard once again shows why he has to be one of the greatest frontmant in the history of music. His vocals on many of the more mellow and haunting songs just give you chills. The Noose, Blue, and Vanishing are examples of this. On the other hand you have songs that have more of a Tool feel to it, such as The Outsider, The Package, Weak and Powerless and Pet. So this album really has everything you could want if your a Maynard fan. But if your a  Maynard fan than you already own this album. This album does take a while to understand, you simply just can't grasp everything on only a few listens. It really is a stunning accomplishment, and I hope APC gets to back togeather to record more music, because this my friends is music done right.
B000FSME1A|4.0|It's too bad that I am one of those people that will give the movie 5 stars but give the DVD treatment a significantly lower score. The bright side is that they keep trying to get it right and even Coppola jokes in an interview that there will be another version coming out next year. I'm a commentary guy and not only is it strange that both movies are cut in half, the method of navigating to the commentaries is different on each disc. Hearts of Darkness is another movie and could have been a nice extra but I understand why it isn't included here. A nice image to add to the cover might be the King of Hearts (the suicide king) with the red heart made black. Francis makes references to the old king (Brando) being killed by the new king (Sheen). I really enjoyed the Walter Murch interviews as I love the sound of this film. This film has so many layers that I can't recall how many times I've revisited parts of it. Almost never sitting thru the whole thing at once. The deleted scenes are worth one look as most deleted scenes are never revisited. Coppola insists that there are not alternate endings but in a way, they exist. The peaceful ending is Sheen leaving the village after symbolically dropping his sword. The napalm airstrike ending with Sheen leaving on the boat but calling in the airstrike coordinates. We learn the fate of the Dennis Hopper character. I learned that much of the movie, especially the ending was written on the fly. Coppola not even having a clear picture of how the film will end. I'd be thrilled if they'd finally upgrade the Blade Runner DVD to a package like this, so... 4 stars.

This masterpiece tells of knowing glances and unspoken understandings.<br /><br />Chevalier's novel, Girl with a Pearl Earring, is the literary analogy. She describes with exquisite sensitivity, and yet with the minimalism one might expect of Hemmingway, the ambiance of a Dutch society where stoic restraint dictates silence, and where social control is achieved with knowing glances and unspoken understandings. She describes perfectly this country were even the Catholics are Protestant in their severity. And yet one where the deepest affections shine through the austere light.

0452270073|3.0|Pat Barker's novel, Regeneration, is an interesting and unusual account of World War I. Instead of taking place in the trenches, the book is set in a mental hospital for shell-shocked soldiers. This setting not only allows Barker to explore the horrors of the war, but also the lives of the soldiers outside of the war. Her use of fascinating non-fiction characters such as Siegfried Sassoon makes the novel even more compelling. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story for the first 60 pages or so, but as the book progressed my interest began to wane. Barker's work now seemed more speculation than fact, and in some parts downright bizarre and overly metaphorical. Overall, I enjoyed the book as a work of fiction, but I believe there is other, more powerful anti-war literature which more accurately portrays the effects of war.
B000FGGE68|5.0|A \\"Fantastic Futuristic Vampire Movie\\"... sounds corny but it's actually pretty cool. If you like science fiction this picture will not disappoint. It has really great visual effects and though some may think of it as a Mila movie, it's actually more a Violet movie ( Mila's character ). Kurt Wimmer did a fantastic Job in creating a Germophobic Vapire-ridden world. As in his movie Equilibrium, characters and their relationships play a very important role in the sequences, not just as 'eye candy' but actual pieces, as in a puzzle or a big orchestra, the way the characters interact define the moods of every scene. Truly recommended for a great and fun sensory experience..

B000002UAU|5.0|It seems after decades, 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' would be the all-time chart topper for best rock album of all time.  While The Beatles innovated music with every effort they created, 'Sgt. Pepper' should be viewed as their most creative and ground-breaking album.  However, as great as it is, it isn't, subjectively, their best.    The false start and the blaring guitars that herald the album with a show tune accompanied by able brass is certainly an ear opener even today.  It starts out the show, a carnival, but it does have some side shows as well.  There are segues throughout, and the special effects elevated The Beatles to the stature of artists in a way only looked at in retrospect on 'Revolver' and 'Rubber Soul'  (Thankfully, the latter classics have in some ways surpassed 'Pepper''s reputation.)  \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" one of the very best songs on the album, melds in with the title song and is still one of their best pop classics of all time.  While \\"Lucy in the Skies with Diamonds\\" and \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" continue the carnival perfection, they also date the album somewhat.  Some of the other highlights of the album include \\"When I'm Sixty Four,\\" with the beginning of Paul's stretch of vaudevillian numbers.  Then, \\"Lovely Rita\\" is ethereal and entertaining.  John is quite able to lift the veil off the conventional world with \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" (based on a Kellogg's Corn Flake Commercial).  Just before the tent folds up, The Beatles deliver the better and more fluid reprise to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" just before they end with a remarkable finale.      All The Beatles try to showcase a new consciousness with songs like Paul's \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\".  George gets his turn with the deep, spiritual realm of \\"Within You and Without You\\".  (And, while it is sincere, articulate, and perceptive, it doesn't fit the album musically as well as \\"Love You To\\" does on 'Revolver'.)  Paul certainly adds depth with his contribution \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" almost a classical piece with tear-jerking lyrics and a story that challenges class differences like 'Lady Chatterly's Lover'.  The finale, \\"A Day in the Life,\\"  is the most celebrated song.  It is the grandest musically and lyrically transcending the ordinary values of life.  The song remains innovative and awe-inspiring.    Overall, The Beatles brought the most innovations to pop music on 'Sgt. Pepper'.  The music is meant to rise above conventional consciousness.  In this sense it can be regarded as a concept album that has some diversions along the way.  Still, 'Sgt. Pepper' is a period piece, one that is magnificent, but is their most dated.  It does come from 1967 and, for better or worse, seems locked in time.  They abandoned the drugs and the magical studio effects, but went ahead later with 'The White Album,' another masterpiece that is more decidedly rock, but without much compromise.  (Like 'Pepper' they did what they really wanted.)  This is a magnificent, but flawed masterpiece.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|Director Wolfgang Peterson seems to be in such a terrible hurry with Poseidon - everything moves at such a fast pace that the characters - and the viewers - rarely have enough time to stop for a mouthful of air. And while the movie campy fun and as suspenseful as the original 1972 Poseidon Adventure, the film is certainly short and most definitely to the point.     In this remake you see lots of extras die as their world is turned upside down one New Year's Eve, with little warning once the \\"rogue wave\\" is sighted and heads towards the doomed luxury liner. Overcome by flooding, shorting electricity and baked by flash fires, the expendable masses yield with barely more than a shocked glimpse, hands clapped over mouths and last-minute hugs with total strangers.    As the Disco and swimming pool, galleys and grand suites and of course the grand ballroom go belly-up, there's the bunch of heroic characters that defy the Captain and decide to head-onward and upward through the waterlogged, overturned ship in feats that call for a deep-sea suspension of disbelief. No matter, because the delectable Josh Lucas leads this eclectic, mismatched gang, and wouldn't you follow him!     Alas, there's no Shelly Winters-like character in this version. The protagonists all come across, as rather nameless and faceless, blandness is the order of the day here. Kurt Russell plays a devoted father, and the ex-Mayor of New York, Richard Dreyfuss is lamenting being dumped by his boyfriend, Josh Lucas is a gambler and I think a fireman - which is why of course he knows the workings of the luxury liner backwards.     Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mia Maestro, Mike Vogel and Kevin Dillon round at the crowd. And they all have remarkably strong lung capacity, considering how long they have to spend underwater! But it doesn't really matter who's who, or who will sink or swim because once the ship flips, character development isn't high on the list of this movie's agenda.     Obviously the specialeffects are what it's all about and there's tons and tons of rushing water, exploding electrical circuits, people caught in air-conditioning shafts and being burnt to death by sudden fires - it's all big and loud and contains some expert stunt work and superb integration of digital technology.     The direction is mostly crisp and although it all gets a bit repetitious towards the end - it also becomes hard to figure out what is going on - the film mostly works because it steps up its dramatic speed early on, and its pacing never falters. Mike Leonard August 06.

0679882820|5.0|My son loves this book -- and so do we!  My husband and I have really enjoyed reading this book, which is great because we read it everyday.  The boardbook design is perfect for young children because the pages can't be easily ripped up or torn, and if a little drool gets on a page or two, it can be wiped off with a damp rag.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks of reading this book, my son has started trying to say, \\"Cockadoodle-doo!\\"  He says, \\"Ca-ca\\" a lot.  It's so cute.  He just loves all of the noises!
0792846443|5.0|What makes `Misery' so brilliant is the chemistry between Kathy Bates and James Caan, and while their relationship is all about lack of chemistry they work so well together everything seems natural, everything seems real.  And that in itself makes Kathy's character of Annie Wilkes one of the most disturbingly scary creations in cinema. <br /> <br />Brilliantly adapted from Stephen Kings novel of the same name, `Misery' tells the story of acclaimed author Paul Sheldon who has just finished his latest novel, a departure from his collection of love stories involving a girl named Misery.  In the air or tradition Paul visits the same Inn he visits as he finishes every novel, but on his way home he is caught in a blizzard that causes him to wreck.  He would have died if it weren't for his number one fan who pulled him from his car and decided to take it upon herself to nurse him back to health. <br /> <br />What at first seems like a kind gesture transforms into heated and violent obsession as Annie keeps Paul hostage in her home, leaving him crippled in his bed to write for her.  She insists that he writes her his masterpiece in dedication to her for saving his life. <br /> <br />It's Bates performance that makes this a memorable film, genuinely thrilling and believable, and as the film progresses we see so many layers to her character, showing us what on the outset could be perceived as pure insanity but upon further study is more sheer depravation and loneliness.  I'm ecstatic that she won the Oscar for this.  Believe me when I say I'm a huge fan of Caan, but he has nothing on Bates electric performance.  I've never read King's novel, but I'm anxious to do so.  I'm sure it's just as good if not better than this movie, but this movie stands alone as a true cinematic masterpiece.

B0002DB52M|5.0|`Dogville' is a unique look at human interaction.  Set in the town of Dogville where the people live in close quarters away from the rest of the world a young woman, a stranger, named Grace (Kidman) comes to escape a group of gangsters seeking her.  Tom (Bettany), who feels he needs to be the moral guide to the town, feels that accepting Grace into their lives and helping her will help the town build character.  So, with all in agreement, they give her two weeks to prove herself no danger to the community, and so with the help from Tom she begins to prove herself by doing jobs here and then for the community. <br /> <br />This small town consisted of many different people, some who embrace Grace right off and others that warm up to her over time.  There's Gloria (Harriet Andersson) who is in charge of ringing the bell to sound off every hour that passes, and there's the Henson household, Liz (Chloe Sevigny) the daughter who wants to get out of town, and Bill (Jeremy Davies) the son who dreams of a better education and a good career.  There's Vera (Clarkson) and Chuck (Skarsgard), the couple with too many children and not enough love between them to make it work.  There's Ben (Ivanek), a somewhat slow freight man who visits the house of ill repute on many occasions.  And there's Tom and his father Tom Sr. (Philip Baker Hall) the doctor. <br /> <br />As Grace cowers to their every command they begin to accept her, that is until they deem her more costly then she's worth and start to abuse her friendship in order to make up the difference.  Their cruelty turns to brutality, but it shows the selfishness in human nature.  The film burns down to a brutal ending, a surprising and controversial ending that makes this tragic tale all the more real and important to the grown of society. <br /> <br />The film is shot in an interesting format; the set's set up as if watching a play, with everything open and exposed, no doors or walls, just a chalk outline on the floor to distinguish living arrangements.  I found this a very interesting way to film the picture and felt it adds to the air that everything in this town is open and exposed to all, nothing hidden, nothing sacred but everything shared.  Some have found this film offensive, but I find it inspiring.  I find it truthful and important and courageous for it isn't shy about exposing the faults in human's but gives to a dramatic portrait of the worst in all of us. <br /> <br />The acting on the parts of the entire cast is subtle yet powerful, Nicole grabbing her character and becoming her, portraying her for who she is, not hiding anything from the viewer.  Paul Bettany also does a great job adding depth to his character, showing pure hearted naivety.  But it's Skarsgard and Clarkson to me that really stand out, delivering knock out performances that transformed them from actors into people.  This film may not be for everyone, but everyone should experience it, at least once.

B0007CNXUK|4.0|Although I feel it's been hyped up a little too much and I don't feel it deserved all the attention there are moments in `Finding Neverland' where I'm touched.  The only problem is I've been touched this way before, and it was better.  There is a beautiful light found in the eyes of Kate Winslet who was robbed of the Oscar nomination for she was the far better actor of the two in question, and yet Depp was the only one to receive the nomination. <br /> <br />The film, as everyone knows, is about J.M. Barrie (Depp), the writer of `Peter Pan' and it chronicles the events in his life that lead to the classic we all know and love.  Those events involve Widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet) and her four boys, in particular Peter (Freddie Highmore).  Peter is struggling to recover from his father's death and dealing with his mothers growing illness and Barrie offers him a form of escape.  As I stated, Winslet does outstanding as the dieing woman who wants nothing more than a good life for her children, but I would feel wrong if not to mention the brilliant acting on young Freddie Highmore's part for he truly commanding the screen. <br /> <br />I will admit when I first saw this film I was smitten by its charm and human appeal, and even now I still love this film.  I just don't feel it's the greatest film on 2004, nor top ten.  It's sweet and alluring but it's nothing new and it's over hyped, as were a lot of films that year.  That's a shame for, when you take away the hype you have a wonderful film that's been...under hyped.   <br /> <br />Does that make any sense?
B000CNESU8|5.0|Of all the movies they make today with absolutley no plot but so many special effects, its no wonder people find this movie, despite its age, a masterpiece.  The story line is covered pretty well, a long term news broadcaster whose ratings are so low decideds to kill himself on tv. He is mentally unstable but his ratings become great so then they decide to keep him on. He rants and raves every night on the news..however he doesn't seem so mad as they might have thought. He tells everything like it is, and isn't afraid to say what people don't want to hear but know in their heart. People listen to him, they are sick of it and he is the only one with guts enough (or whom the networks will let) say it in public. He talks about coruption, he talks about greed, he encourages people to stand up for themselves and tell the big corperations and government to listen to them. That is until his network gets bought out by a forein company and he encourages the people to stop watching tv. The people do, they are mad about the big corperations controlling the media, and his ratings drop. But not only his..all the ratings do, and the company is getting lots of negative preassure because of the buyout. Well, its to long to give the whole outline so I'll stop there but this movie is funny, serious, and full of twists.  Yes you have to deal with the cheesy 70's hair styles, color and effects, but this is a thinking mans movie so they really is only a speck of dust int he big picture.   This movie was very moving, and as I had read no reviews the end was a suprise, as were many things that I didn't expect to happen. Whats more is this movie is almost believeable in todays age.  This movie is deffenitly a must in my opinion for anyone to watch.
B000FSME1A|1.0|Lame. Lame. Lame.  Why would Paramount put the first half of each version on Disc 1, and the second half of each version on Disc 2?  This is grossly irritating -- to have to change discs in the middle of the movie.  This is even stupider than when Mirimax split the movie AND the special features up onto two discs for Gangs of New York. <br />And, yes, Hearts of Darkness should be a part of this set.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Without a doubt one of the all time WORST movies ever made. There is nothing at all positive to say about this film.

Not even worth buying to use as a frisbe. <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|There have been many books written about various clinical conditions that impact the ways in which those effected think. Much of that literature is `clinical' or `professional' in nature - not generally written for lay people, but for those whose work involves dealing with or treating them. Then, there is a marginally related genre of books about mental illness written by people who, themselves, have suffered from them. Mark Vonnegut's (son of author, Kurt) The Eden Express, describing his own experience with schizophrenia comes to mind. There have been many others of this type. They are personal accounts, not intended to entertain or teach, but to share e, describing his own experience with schizophrenia comes to mind. There have been many others of this type. They are personal accounts, not intended to entertain or teach, but to share experience. There are sub-types including well-known books like Sybyl, a somewhat fictionalized `real story' of a woman who suffered from a dissociative disorder (\\"multiple personalities.\\")<br /><br />Finally, there is another genre, of which this new book by Mark Haddon is representative.<br /><br />Haddon takes us inside the mind of a boy whose thinking would be characterized as `odd' in some very specific and seemingly peculiar ways. The child is incredibly concrete in his thinking, extraordinarily gifted in some areas - particularly those involving science, math and puzzles of all sorts - but who is socially inept to a degree earning his condition a clinical diagnosis - most frequently, Asperger's Disorder. This disorder is at the lower end of the continuum of developmental problems that are captured under the rubric of \\"Autistic Spectrum Disorders.\\" But this is not a review of a piece of clinical literature - it is, rather, a review of a novel written by an author who has succeeded in capturing the inner workings, machinations and processes of a child born with this disorder who decides to write a novel! While it is always challenging to tell about a novel without retelling it, here goes my best effort:<br /><br />Christopher John Francis Boone is odd.... That is to say, he has many idiosyncrasies, eccentricities, preferences, special abilities or symptoms - depending on your point of view. He car barely tolerate being touched - even by those he is closest to, loves red, hates yellow and he numbers the chapters of the book exclusively with prime numbers. To call him socially inept is a great understatement. In fact, he does suffer from an known and identified developmental problem that has impacted the way in which he processes information about the world around him and the people in it. He is a kid who tried to figure out who killed the dog of one of his neighbors.<br /><br />The story itself is quite mundane. A dog is killed, a boy with unusual perspective and referents tries to `solve' the case; single parenthood is an issue as are various social realities facing such children as Christopher. While this may sound somehow unusual to say about a novel - the story, itself, is not the most interesting feature of the book. It is, rather, the character, courage and quirkiness of the protagonist and the people and situations with which he interacts.<br /><br />It is said that we are all different. I'm sure that this is true - but Christopher's character reminds us that there are degrees of difference and some of us are further along that continuum than are others. More importantly, those differences to not make us less interesting or relevant as people, though those seen as being somehow `too' different are often categorized too quickly as being too odd to be useful to society. Not true. The special abilities this boy has and demonstrates throughout the book (his \\"savant\\" qualities) are parts of make him who he is.<br /><br />The crime is solved, risks are taken and everyone survives (except, of course, the murdered dog.) This is an important book - maybe even a necessary one to be read by those interested in understanding the inner workings of a mind that is truly different.<br /><br />I recommend it to both professional and lay readers alike.se interested in understanding the inner workings of a mind that is truly different.<br /><br />I recommend it to both professional and lay readers alike.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|A great effort by this underated New England band. Their previous cd, \\"This Darkened Heart\\", was good. But, \\"The Fall of Ideals\\", is a few notches better. Honestly, I think these guys are better than both, Killswitch Engage (KSE) and Shadows Fall. Also from the New England region and immensely popular. <br /> <br /> The guitar work by Oli Hebert & Mike Martin is impeccable. Though similiar to Shadows Fall's axe tandem, Jonathan Donais & Matt Bachand. Hebert & Martin have expanded upon that formula. Frankly they do it better and with more creativity. Vocalist Phil Labonte displays his versatility on this album. Again, doing it better than vocalist Brian Fair of Shadow's Fall. <br /> <br /> I hope with this album. That metal fans become more aware of this band ! <br /> <br />
B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie's fifth LP transformed him into (duh) a rock 'n roll star. There was much promise of him becoming one with his third CD, The Man Who Sold the World. However, he then backed up a bit - in terms of volume, not quality - with the unbelievably masterful Hunky Dory, a mosaic of rock, pop, folk, psychedelia, and whatever else was in arm's reach. On The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust & the Spiders From Mars, Bowie's flair for the dramatic became a full-blown obsession. While uptempo hard rock once again formed the core of the record, gentle acoustic numbers and genuine pop was not neglected. The result was what may or may not be his greatest record, but it is certainly his definitive one, ie, it is the one that best defines him.<br /><br />And yeah, it is a concept album of sorts. Part of me wants to say wooptie doo, but the fact is that Bowie meant for this to tell the story of a futuristic space-age rock star (one surely not too far removed from Jimi Hendrix). In doing so, he created the most indelible of his many images. While they don't really dampen the overall quaility of the disc, a few of the songs - \\"Soul Love\\", \\"It Ain't Easy\\", \\"Suffragette City\\" - seem to interrupt the flow of the narrative a bit. Other than that, the story holds together quite well, from the portentous opener \\"Five Years\\" to the curtain-closing \\"Rock 'N Roll Suicide\\". Along the way, we witness Ziggy's arrival (\\"Starman\\"), his earthly revelation (\\"Lady Stardust\\"), his dreams of stardom (\\"Star\\"), and the realization of it (\\"Ziggy Stardust\\").<br /><br />On this CD, Bowie eschews folk and psychedelia, but covers all the other rock bases. As on all of Bowie's early records, Mick Ronson's guitar is the co-headliner. \\"Starman\\" and \\"Star\\" are strong, singalong pop songs. \\"Lady Stardust\\" and \\"Rock 'N Roll Suicide\\" are largely acoustic numbers with sprinkles of bombast. \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Suffragette City\\" are headbanging rockers, while \\"Hang Onto To Yourself\\" suggests that Bowie and Ronson had the idea for punk rock guitar a few years before The Ramones did. (Plus, Ziggy's spikey orange hair seems to have beaten Johnny Rotten to the punch.)<br /><br />Ziggy Stardust is a masterful blend of style and substance. It is the great songs, above anything, that make it such a brilliant record, and David Bowie's best in the minds of many. But one should not belittle the value of the Ziggy character. After all, Ziggy is the image most likely to pop into one's mind when s/he thinks of David Bowie. By creating Ziggy Stardust, Bowie literally brought his songs to life - on record and stage - with camp and circumstance. (The 1990 Rykodisc edition of this CD is worth seeking out for its valuable bonus tracks. These include the essential glam-rockers \\"Velvet Goldmine\\", the uber-rare \\"Sweet Head\\", and the superb \\"John, I'm Only Dancing\\". Also included are straight acoustic versions of \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Lady Stardust\\", the poignancy of which are brought into full relief by bare-bones presentation.)for punk rock guitar a few years before The Ramones did.

B000G759LW|2.0|This cd is a dissapointment. I regret not listening to it before I bought it. I'm not into jazz and blues music so I couldn't appreciate the vast majority of the songs on either cd. It seems like a blast from the past that I am not interested in. I think there are about 3 songs I could maybe get into and they are not that great because I can't even remember the titles. I was hoping that the second disc in the set would be a little different than the first and while it is to a certain extent I still wasn't impressed. I absolutley loved Stripped (2003) so I assumed this one would be great as well. My advice to Christina fans: LISTEN TO THE CD BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|This is my favourite movie, and the cinematography and music are amazing.  In addition the various themes of belonging, loss, betrayal, and love, there is the fact that all these characters caught up in the war are so young.  The disfigured Caravaggio, the naive and delightful Hana, the Sikh who defuses bombs... they are all young people who are still adjusting to the fact that life doesn't always give you what you want - less so during times of war.  We even see how young the English Patient is during flashbacks, though he looks older and seems wiser since his experiences of physical and emotional loss.  He knows he's dying, but everyone around him is also aware that they too, could die at any time; that's not something that young people usually think about on a regular basis. <br /> <br />It is a beautiful film.  It is also a deep film that reveals how different people respond to the fact that they could die any day.

1592401791|5.0|You have your MP3 player all filled up with Beatles songs?  OK, now you're all set to listen to this entertaining and edifying book by the Beatles main recording engineer - the man responsible for what we actually heard - Geoff Emerick.  So when Emerick tells us that John Lennon wanted \\"to sound like the Dalai Lama\\" on a mountain top in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" and he achieved that by using rotating speakers, we can go straight to that track and visualize what he did. <br /> <br />In an age when practically anything can be done with computers, this book gives us a refreshing look at 40 years ago when editing was done by literally taking a razor blade to audio tape and sounds were created by running up and down halls with microphones.  Told in a detailed, but not overly-technical style, Emerick takes us through his assistant days and early Beatles tunes  (the jangling fadeout at the end of \\"Hard Day's Night\\" was put in to facilitate the fadein for the next scene in the movie) through his fullest professional years working on Revolver, Sgt. Pepper (the chord that goes on forever at the end of \\"A Day In The Life\\" was created by turning up the record volume as the chord grew quieter - so much so that you can hear the studio air conditioner running in the background), Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine, then the White Album and Abbey Road.   <br /> <br />The book covers some of the Beatles personalities, and that's nice to see, but this isn't a Beatles book per se.  It's more a fun making-of documentary.   <br />

074327931X|4.0|GMAT 800 is a very popular book. Whoever at Kaplan came up with the name ought to get a raise and an immediate promotion to the head of the marketing department. Everybody wants an 800, and we'd all like to think that working really hard through the materials in one book will get us there. <br /> <br />Of course, that's ridiculous. This book claims to have the \\"hardest problems,\\" and while it has a few, that's just not true. A better title would be \\"GMAT 720.\\" That's not to say the book isn't worthwhile. It probably does have more difficult problems than any other popular book on the market--it certainly contains more than any other Kaplan book or the Official Guides. <br /> <br />I am disappointed, however, with the way material is distributed in this book. The hardest questions on the GMAT aren't equally divided among every content area: there's more difficult Data Sufficiency than Problem Solving and more probability than algebra. However, there are only a handful of probability questions in this book, and the Problem Solving/Data Sufficiency split is heavily weighted toward the former. There are indeed more Problem Solving questions on the GMAT, but high-scoring students aiming for the top need Data Sufficiency practice more. <br /> <br />If you are scoring 650 or better and aim higher, this is a great book to have. However, don't put too much stock in the tips--they aren't explained terribly well, and in my opinion they aren't even the best methods to do some of their problems.  If you can comfortably do every question in this book in a reasonable amount of time, you may not get a perfect score, but you'll do very well.
B00080Z53O|5.0|Javier Bardem is perfectly cast as Ramon Sampredo, a quadriplegic who fights unsuccessfully for the right to end his life for 30 years before finally meeting someone who is brave and loving enough to help him do it.  Yes there are tons of arresting questions, philosophical and existential, that this movie touches on but it does so economically rather than pedantically, and does not indulge in polemic.<br /><br />I originally had some reservations about seeing this film because the plotline seemed a bit too soap-operatic, like a made-for-TV production.  Luckily this was not the case, in large part due to the decidedly un-Hollywoodish Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar (whose \\"Abre Los Ojos\\" was far superior to \\"Vanilla Sky\\" the Hollywood remake of it) which keeps lots of zingy humor and vivid color in front of us rather than going for the cheap tear-jerking hooks.  Also there are enough involving secondary characters and locations to avoid a claustrophobic bedside film---Belen Rueda, who plays Sampredo's lawyer and then love interest, is without a doubt one of the most strikingly gorgeous women on the planet and definitely kept my interest throughout.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I have to disagree with most of the critics' negative reviews. I thought this was an excellent horror movie, and a very good variation on the original video game for ps1 - which had multiple endings depending on how you played out different scenarios. With the few unanswered questions towards the end of the movie, the viewer is left only to speculate on what really happened in Silent Hill.<br /><br />DVD extras include a lengthy \\"Making of\\" segment, as well preview on the new Ghost Rider movie.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|When one thinks of auteurs who invested themselves frequently in the Western genre, a few names come to mind: John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone. Ford's films featured absolutely beautiful photography and locations with poignant storytelling, Peckinpah's films were often blood-soaked stories of the West, and Leone's films were operatic, highly stylized epics. While popular opinion holds Ford as the definitive Western auteur (and he most likely is), Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West's nostalgic and meloncholy take on the death of the Old West is simply beautiful. Everything about this film is perfect, from the unforgettable score to the excellent performances to the powerful climax. Leone crafts a bittersweet farewell to the Western, telling the story of the mythic cowboy's demise at the hands of westward expansion (via the railroad). This film will entertain you for its running time and haunt you for long afterwards.

B00003CX9E|5.0|At the age of 25, Orson Welles burst onto the Hollywood scene with this masterpiece. The fact that this film is in black and white and is considered the best ever made unfortunately scares away many from my generation; little do they realize that this was perhaps the most modern film of the period. From its revolutionary (and still awe-inspiring) visual style to its memorable performances, Citizen Kane is a genius accomplishment. Welles, like a sponge, soaked in the qualities of world cinema (primarily European cinema) and used these tools to create a film that is unlike anything before or since. The heartbreaking story of Charles Foster Kane is the embodiment of the American Dream in all its glory and folly, providing a mature and modern outlook on the fallability of man. Surprisingly entertaining (it's actually quite funny), this film says more than the first two Godfather films, and in a third of the time, no less. It is necessary viewing for any film-lover.

B00009W0WM|5.0|Casablanca is probably the best happy accident in the history of film (The Third Man in a close second). This film should have been forgettable, but thanks to a wonderful cast, Curtiz's direction, and a script that has given popular culture some of the most enduring quotes of all time, Casablanca is a massive success. Bogart plays Rick Blaine, the cynical club owner in Casablanca who experiences the unthinkable when the only woman he ever loved (the beautiful Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa) comes back into his life, though not in the manner he had hopes; she is married to Victor Laszlo, a resistance fighter against Hitler's Third Reich. What follows is a touching love triangle that climaxes in perhaps the most perfect 10 minutes in the history of movies. This one is not to be missed.
B000022TSH|5.0|Some movies you just appreciate more with age.  What I mean is that there are movies you see when you're younger and you don't fully appreciate them or admire how well crafted they are.  This was the case with \\"Chinatown\\" for me.  I saw it many years ago for the first time, and while I enjoyed it somewhat, at the time I thought it was long, slow and dreadfully bleak at the end.  Of course, I didn't get the point that that's what \\"Chinatown\\" is supposed to be, and that's why it's brilliant.  I watched it recently for the second time, and I fell in love with it.  Absolute love.<br /><br />A younger Jack Nicholson plays a private investigator, Jake Gittes.  Normally, he deals with cases that involve suspected adultery, so it's no surprise when a Mrs. Mulwray asks for his help.  What does surprise him is that she is married to Hollis Mulwray, a chief engineer of the water department.  What else is not up to par is the fact that the woman really wasn't Mrs. Mulwray, but somebody pretending to be her.  Curious, Jake goes deeper into the case to see what's really what, but it's not before long that Hollis ends up dead, and Jake has no idea what's the score or who it is he can trust.  This is just the basics of the movie.  What follows is a very complex plot filled with twists and turns that lead Jake to a place he thought he would never have to return to... Chinatown.<br /><br />As I said before, the first time I saw this I thought it was an okay movie, mainly because I love Nicholson in it.  Now, I can watch the movie with older and wiser eyes and I can truly admire and appreciate the labor of love this film really is.  I didn't find myself bored with it at all, and in fact I could've watched another two hours if the story chose to go that far.  The reason for that is the cast and the writing really sells it.  It's not so much the plot that's the star of the picture, it's the characters and the people who play them.  Hell, the plot could've involved a simple pick-pocket and I would've still found myself captivated by it because you enjoy the trip the characters give you.  The film takes its time and doesn't rush.  It's not afraid of silence and it doesn't find itself having to go for silly non-stop car chases or shoot-outs to keep the viewer entertained.<br /><br />While everybody is great in this movie, Nicholson really steals every scene, and the great thing is that he doesn't try to steal it.  He could stand still, just observing a quiet room and your eyes never leave him.  I don't think the movie would've worked if he wasn't the lead man in it.  Faye Dunaway also does a superb job, and you know she does because you really don't know how much you can trust her, and that's exactly what Nicholson's character goes through.  The DVD is pretty basic.  Other than a little retrospective with Roman Polanski, Robert Towne and Robert Evans, and a theatrical trailer, there aren't a lot of bells and whistles.  The picture looks good for it being so old.  I'm hoping that they'll release a special edition sometime in the near future, as this is an important film that deserves such a treatment.<br /><br />\\"Chinatown\\" is one of those movies that you find yourself appreciating more and more the older you get.  It's a classic, and it's easy to see why it is.  It's exciting without a high body count or loud and pointless chases (sure, there is violence and there are chases, but they are used very carefully and only for the right reasons).  The film reminds us that if you have the characters and the right actors, you could watch them for hours without yawning once.  I'm glad I took the trip again.  I would've missed out big time had I not decided to revisit \\"Chinatown.\\"  Put this one on your list if you haven't seen it already.  Even if you don't end up loving it or liking it, it is something worth seeing at least once.  -Michael Craneet and I would've still found myself captivated by it because you enjoy the trip the characters give you.

0671015206|2.0|I admit, I must have missed the point of this book. It describes a very simple way to become a millionaire *on paper* while giving plenty of examples of millionaires in today's society. It points out that most of the high-profile people (doctors, lawyers with armani suits and sports cars) we think are millionaires aren't necessarily that rich because they *spend*. Often it's the hard-working guy next door with a modest house and his own business that is really the millionaire. Fair enough, that is an interesting point.  <br /> <br />But who cares, really? What does it mean to be a millionaire on paper if you never spend a dime of your money. My grandfather made a very modest salary his whole life, but he was extraordinarily frugal, and never traveled or never bought new clothes. He died leaving a small fortune behind only to be fought over by his children. Did he understand the \\"value\\" of money more than the present-day yuppie who spends every dime he makes and is deep in credit card debt? While technically, my grandfather was probably a millionaire, he lived a miserable life and his family suffered because of it when they always had to do without. And although he died at 76, he never got a chance to spend any of his money.  <br /> <br />My point is, this is not a book on how to raise your standard of living. It's simply a guide to how to become a millionaire on paper. And the sad fact is to do that you need to stop spending and start saving. Anyone can be a millionaire if you go without. But, seriously, we need to think, is that the life that we want? As they say, \\"You can't take it with you.\\" Being smart and saving for retirement is one thing, but this book is all about a single extreme -- hording money to achieve that magic 7 figure mark.  <br /> <br />I'd rather read something by Suze Orman any day instead of this. At least she gives concrete, well-though out ideas on how to eliminate debt and save more and be HAPPIER with your life, not just richer on paper.
B000GTLQXU|1.0|Has the palette of American movie goers gone completely bland??  I'll start 30 seconds into the film, the wide shot of the ship.  Very very unrealistic and cheap CGI made the entire boat glossy and very artificial.  Remember many portions of this movie are shot on a green screen stage...  So you can tell nearly every shot of the movie is shot in lighting a half meter different than the virtual background (the indoor shots of the ship and the outdoor shots) the only real sound stages used in the movie were for the bedrooms, the captains deck, oh and some of the crappy, dark and 80's neon destructive backgrounds after the ship flips over.  It's insane how the ship turns from a 5 star cruise ship, to a resident evil meets Bladerunner catastrophe.  If you think that this movie is going to handle a ship wreck as well as they did in the Titanic, you're gravely mistaken.<br /><br />The movie's intro is 10 minutes of learning about 6 character's sad and pathetic lives and what dysfunctions their having with parents, lovers etc.  Then, literally 3 minutes later in the movie everything goes completely to hell.  The acting is terrible and all over the map, with Kurt Russell playing over the top, Dreyfus is an 80 year old hack, and all the other B role characters are completely pathetic even that blonde young guy I don't know his name and he doesn't deserve to be recognized by name anyways because his acting was so awful.<br /><br />Literally 35-40 minutes into the movie my friend and I looked at each other laughing to tears at how terrible this movie was and I cursed him for renting it.  There is NOTHING good about this movie.  On top of bad acting, cheesey dialogue, bad special effects, and a terrible soundtrack (okay the Orchestrated parts are okay, but the black eye peas girl is horrendous) this movie has the Goriest scenes you'll see in any current blockbuster.  Mind you this isn't as gory as the Hills Have Eyes, or Descent, but it does show many close up shots of dead peoples bloodied faces and mangle limbs, and not to mention, half the cast gets killed in incredibly morbid and horrifying ways.  Something no kids should be subjected to.  Some of the death scenes made me sick to my stomach.  I can't believe ANYBODY with taste in movies would want to see this.  I can thankfully say I didn't spend any money on renting it and neither should you.  BUT if you like TERRIBLE acting, TERRIBLE and incredibly improbable storylines, TERRIBLE DIALOGUE, oh TERRIBLE Special FX, NO NUDITY(lol), and watching people swim, push, and climb over mounds of dead people bleeding and oozing, then be my guest.ad peoples bloodied faces and mangle limbs, and not to mention, half the cast gets killed in incredibly morbid and horrifying ways.

B000G759LW|5.0|I've always known this gal had the pipes to put everyone else to shame, but sadly she didn't always use them to her advantage -- seeming to think she had to resort to being flashy and wild to get attention away from others. Finally Xtina seems to have found herself -- her songs on this album are very personal, have a very clear message and she is finally on her way to proving she has the best voice of this generation.  Some of the songs are heartwrenching; others are excitedly sexy and fun.  But all in all, this is a SUPERB album and every music lover should own it.  BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!  Then listen to it constantly!!!  This gal has finally hit her stride -- I expect more and more from her in the future now that she has finally gotten herself some inner peace and finds herself in a good place!! <br /> <br />Kathy D-NJ
0385503954|5.0|There is a small collection of books I keep that I cannot let go of. It consists of stories, bold and interesting styles, or just plain wonderful writing that I know I will continue to defer and refer to. Atonement is one of these. What Ian McEwan does with the sense of place (not just environmental, but social) is a gift of pure good story-telling. He accomplishes  this with language so fluid that you're grabbed up into the book before you even notice. That, to me is wonderful writing.
0439574285|5.0|Following are brief reviews of each of the excellent collection of twelve original Sherlock Holmes short stories that Arthur Conan Doyle published in a newspaper serial in the 1890's:<br /><br />Scandal in Bohemia **** - Fun story.  Holmes makes use of his disguises and acting talents to almost reel in a smart and tricky woman, who has acquired means to blackmail the future King of Bohemia.<br /><br />The Red-Headed League **** - Another Fun story.  But the crooks could have gotten away with their plan by simply continuing to operate The Red-Headed League until after they finished their criminal activities.<br /><br />A Case of Identity **** - A woman is jilted at the altar, and a mystery ensues.  Nobody ends up murdered or physically hurt in this story - just a serious case of a broken heart, with money as the motive.<br /><br />Boscombe Valley Mystery ***** - Top-notch Holmes mystery involving blackmail, murder, secrets, and romance.  This story does not seem dated at all; and, if you replaced the carriages with automobiles, could have taken place last week in any small rural town in England or America.<br /><br />The Five Orange Pips **** - Skullduggery involving an ex-Confederate Colonel, and the KKK.  Somewhat spooky, but the motive for the murders is a bit shaky, and the ending a bit loose.<br /><br />The Man with the Twisted Lip ***** - Holmes disguises himself as an opium smoker to help get to the bottom of the disappearance of an affluent father.  The story involves all sorts of unsavory characters and situations - Victorian London's East Side was not so different from the inner city of any large modern Metropolis.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle **** - A short Christmas story of thievery and intrigue, involving a goose and a jewel.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Speckled Band *** - Good mystery, but not accurate on details... after reading on the Internet how many technical errors this story has, it hard to give it too high a rating.  This case involves murders, for the express goal of monetary gain.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb **** - One of the shorter adventures and spookier than normal; Holmes solves the mystery and thwarts the criminals' continuing their counterfeiting, but the good-hearted bad guy sidekicks and their murderous leader end up fleeing the scene of the crime before they can be apprehended.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor **** - A little too far-fartched, this story does have a lot of interesting situations... one is that there are a lot of Americans in it, and another is that Holmes says that he believes England and America will eventually form a \\"world-wide country\\".<br /><br />The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet **** - Decent story.  First time that Holmes seems to use the phrase \\"when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth\\".<br /><br />The Adventure of the Copper Beeches ***** - More rural skulduggery.  This very believable tale rivals THE ENGINEER'S THUMB for spookiness.<br /><br />These stories are all now in the public domain; hence the multiple versions distributed by various publishers.  These stories are also available from various sources on the Internet.case involves murders, for the express goal of monetary gain.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb **** - One of the shorter adventures and spookier than normal; Holmes solves the mystery and thwarts the criminals' continuing their counterfeiting, but the good-hearted bad guy sidekicks and their murderous leader end up fleeing the scene of the crime before they can be apprehended.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor **** - A little too far-fartched, this story does have a lot of interesting situations... one is that there are a lot of Americans in it, and another is that Holmes says that he believes England and America will eventually form a \\"world-wide country\\".<br /><br />The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet **** - Decent story.

0553582445|4.0|The Tawny man trilogy continues the story of Fitzchivalry farseer 15 years after the 'Farseer' trilogy. So if you havent read that series, than start there, and you wont be dissapointed.<br /><br />This trilogy is full of new characters wich in my opinion are proving to be even more interesting than the previous books. It is full of adventure, mystery, court intrigue and some lesser magics that the story revolves around. If you have read any of Hobbs previous work and enjoyed it than this will be no exception. I only wish I had read the LiveShip traders trilogy before this one. Its story has different characters, but falls chronologically between the 'Farseer' trilogy and this one.<br /><br />So if you read them in chronological order it goes like this-<br />'Farseer' trilogy<br />'Liveship trader' trilogy<br />'Tawny Man' trilogy<br /><br />Any fan of fantasy should give these books a read.
0307120007|5.0|I couldn't count how many copies of this book I have purchased.  The most recent was for my third grandchild due later this month. This book is the best there is for the very young child. For each of my own three children, it was a stand-out favorite that was read over and over until overuse required it be replaced. We certainly couldn't be without a copy! Since then, this book is always included whenever I give gifts to new parents.<br /><br />The book is the touchy-feely type so the child explores the soft fur of the bunny, Daddy's scratchy beard, etc.  The only times I hesitated buying it for a new baby was once when the mom was unwed and the father was not involved with her or the child (there is a page on Daddy's beard and one for mother's ring) and another time for a family of color since parents in the book are Caucasian.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Slayer's best since maybe Seasons, but not to compare.  Christ Illusion is oozing with speed, pummelling drums, and killer riffs. The sound on the album is great.  Drums pummel, rhythm guitars are straight distorted Marshalls (no added effects), and straight in vocal tracks. Cool, short guitar solos peppered throughout the cd  allow the songs to develop, without losing their ferociousness.  Bare basics, pummelling mix (a little more bass guitar would have been nice, but that's expected with a Slayer release). Most songs provide either a lot of speed with some killer groove riffs mixed in, or killer grooves with shorter speed sections.  Being a huge Slayer fan for about 20 years now, C.I. keeps it interesting (something the last few cds lacked at times).  Start to finish, the cd is a beatdown. C.I. sounds like a progression of G.H.U.A., but definitely has the old \\"flavor\\" of Slayer mixed within (without sounding tired or forced).The songs develop very well this time around.  I could list all tracks, with the exception of 'Eyes of the Insane' as \\"Picks\\", but I'll only list the \\"best of the best\\".  <br />Picks: Fleshstorm, Skeleton Christ, Jihad, Cult, & Supremist.
B000002534|5.0|Ya lo dije una vez aquí en inglés y no voy a alabarlo más. Desde que conocí Borboletta, quedé con la impresión de que iba a ser difícil mejorarlo. Eso se ha cumplido por más de un cuarto de siglo. Cuando veo los comentarios de la mayoría aquí expuestos, me faltan palabras para explicarlo mejor. El verdadero motivo de este comentario es lamentar la escasez de apertura mental de unos pocos que parece no pueden apreciar a Santana más allá de su rock latino. Y eso me hace concluir que este no es un album para ellos. No para gente que sólo espera la inmediatez.    Caigan ustedes en la cuenta de lo mal que está la música últimamente, que sin estar Santana en su mejor momento, es declarada Smooth como canción del año, no hace mucho tiempo atrás. Claro, es que esa es la maquinaria ultra comercial que hoy obliga a que la música esté en función del video, y a la pobre gente la han mal acostumbrado a que la música actualmente es para verla y no para escucharla.
B000EGCITG|1.0|This was by far the dumbest album I've ever had the displeasure of purchasing. As a Pink fan, I could not remember why I haven't bought the album. This is why shopping at the Walmart Supercenter at about 2:30 a.m. is not the best idea because after listening to the album, I rediscovered why I'm no longer a Pink fan. Stupid Girls is supposedly a stab at the other girls and girl bands in the industry. At least they found a genre and stuck to it. Pink went from wannabe R&B to sample pop/rock to rock to I don't know what the hell this is. She is maybe one of the fakest singers out there, so I hardly think stupid gilrs was the best first single. She now sucks and I must disengage from my memory in T-30 seconds. Must Destroy For All Listening-Kind!!
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend: \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\", \\"KIDS\\", \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\", and \\"Traffic\\".

B00005QG9J|5.0|I discovered incubus one night in 1999 or so, just before Make Yourself was released. I heard \\"Pardon Me\\" on the radio and i was hooked. Two years later, Morning View is released. By then, i was already familiar with their songs and was eager to see how they had evolved/built upon their earlier work. Lemme tell ya, this record did not dissapoint. Incubus has a knack for evolving with each cd they release. I say \\"evolve\\" rather than \\"change,\\" because it is extremely graceful rather than forced. <br /> <br />As a critic, this cd has pretty much everything i could hope for: experimental time signatures, violins, interesting guitar effects, soulful lyrics, even crickets chirping at the end of the cd! It is really nothing you would expect from a \\"nu metal/funk\\" band. This cd is rich and complex and very thoughtful. <br /> <br />As a listener, its a little harder to get into. With Make Yourself, all it took was one spin and i was forever hooked. This CD (along with most other great cds) takes a little longer to sink your teeth into. <br /> <br />Overall, id reccomend this cd to anyone who can appreciate a band that isnt content with creating the same sound over and over again, a band that wants to create something that THEY are proud of, a band that is a step above the other bands that it is unfairly labeled with.

B000FGFSPG|5.0|I was really looking forward to have this new DVD of Nightwish since it was first announced and finally I got it. <br /> <br />First of all to say, this is the best performance that Nightwish has done so far. Even though she would be fired after the concert, the band members' and Tarja's performance and interactivity are at the top and this is really very confusing. <br /> <br />DVD's best songs are the starter Dark Chest Of Wonders, Ever Dream, The Phantom Of The Opera, Creek Mary's Blood. In the song \\"The Kinslayer\\" something is wrong at the recording because the Tuomas' keyboard can hardly be heard. <br /> <br />There is a strange thing about the DVD that there is no \\"She Is My Sin\\" in the playlist. That song is one of the blockbusters of Nightwish and it's really confusing why they didn't perform that song in a concert this large. <br /> <br />Final words, this is the Nightwish's last (and I think final) masterpiece of work. When you're watching the concert, you will understand clearly that Nightwish will have really hard times without Tarja's voice. I like Nightwish and their approach to music, but I'm not sure they can hold enough without a great voice like hers. I hope I'll be wrong.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I saw all the big movies of the summer of '06, but the only movie I went to see twice was \\"The Lake House\\". <br /> <br />I've been a Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves fan forever, and I've been waiting for them to reunite since \\"Speed\\". This film does not disappoint. Their affection for each other is obvious, and their chemistry sparkles even through the seperation of time and place this story invokes. <br /> <br />This is a beautifully crafted, acted, and visually stunning movie that takes you back to old fashioned romance through an old fashioned form of communication - letter writing. <br /> <br />Hollywood, and the world in general, seems to have become too cynical to produce many stories as sweet and deeply touching as this. God bless Bullock and Reeves for believing in this project, and letting us revel in a true love story. I don't know if this film would have worked without them, but thankfully we don't have to find out. It is worth watching for them alone. I can't think of any other onscreen couple in recent memory that shine in each other's presence like they do. The film industry would benefit greatly from them doing more movies together. <br /> <br />So grab a loved one or a best friend, a box of Kleenex, and settle in for my favorite film of the year. As you get to know Kate and Alex and root for them through their struggles, I know you won't regret it.
B00008NGHI|5.0|This is a very good Artist and band. The engineering is very well done for SACD use as well. The music is refreshing and differant, Alison and the Union Station band play like a fiddle and bow together. The multi-channel mixing are equalized and balanced beautifully for an enjoyable surround event your will appreciate.
B000G75AE8|4.0|This is an overall very good and brutal Slayer album, a mix of \\"God Hates us All\\" and \\"Season in the Abyss\\" i will compare it. <br />Songs that stand out are \\"Supremist\\" and \\"Flesh Storm\\" that sounds something from God Hates. <br /> <br />The reason I did not give it a 5 star is because Slayer should have included some special features like some videos or something to make it a special buy; but the cd is 100% Slayer, you wont be dissapointed like I was with \\"Divine Intervention\\" back in 1994. <br /> <br />Did I say is great to have original drummer Cuban sensation Dave Lombardo back!!!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|How can Pixar continue to amaze us with each movie they do, and continue to raise the bar each time?  Story.  Story, and incredible animation.  Their movies aren't the simple thrown-together-done-on-a-computer-and-get-it-out-quick-for-some-quick-money computer animated movies as of late.  Their storys have heart.  A lot of heart.  And yes, their animination is second to none.  Cars is no different.  I'm not huge into Nascar, but this movie appeals on so many levels, there's something for everyone in it.  I won't rehash the plot here.  Trust me, it's very good.  You'll love the voice talent, you'll love the animation, and Pixar's never ending inside jokes thoughtout the movie.  And if you're a Pixar fan, you'll die over the end credits.  Buy this.  You will NOT be disapointed.

B000G759LW|5.0|I'm listening to Xtina's album right now on Rhapsody and wanted to write a review.  However, after reading a couple of glowing remarks wrought with flowery description, I realized the best way to sum it up is BUY IT!  It's good music.  There's really nothing more than that.  Lyrically. Production-wise. It's better than anything else out.  Christina Aguilera understands her voice better than anyone else, and it is a pleasure to hear what she hears in her head.  It's absolutely breathtaking.  She really respects you as a person to have put so much heart, soul, and care into two albums, equally amazing.  For that alone, you have to buy this double CD.

B000F5GNX8|1.0|I thought this was going to be a great movie.  I love Robert Downey Junior and Val Kilmer.  The first scene really caught my attention, then it went completely downhill from there.  I understood what was going on, but I thought the plot was kind of dull and silly.  Detective lessons?  I mean, come on.  I just felt like it was a little too unbelievable.  I had to turn it off at the end because it just dragged on so long and I was falling asleep.  Maybe I missed some sweet ending that would have made the whole thing worthwhile, but it wasn't worth it at that point.
1881273156|3.0|Upon seeing the title, I was not only drawn to finish it, but was determined to gain something that I could carry with me for the rest of my life. Chapman groups how humans express and receive love into five basic categories. And while it sounds too easy, it actually is. The author provides his readers, especially those in need of a relationship-saving action plan, with solid examples and specific methods on how to better one's marriage. Improvement and positive change takes time, but it's never too late to learn how to love your significant other more efficiently and wholeheartedly or to joyfully and fully recieve his or her love, for that matter.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This show has a lot of surprises and twists. It is definitely PG-13 or PG-17. It isn't for the faint of heart. I love it and can't wait to see the second season. The actors are terrific and the plots are suspenseful.
B000EQH2QK|4.0|this album rock's. The kid's think I'm cool having this in our collection.
1401302378|4.0|This book is just a strong wake up call for all of us who are aware of what is happening, but are not doing anything about it.  Chris Anderson clearly defined what needs to be done, although limited to mostly retailing concerns over the internet.  It would have been a more enlightening book if Mr. Anderson was able to show the impact of the Long Tail of business in other industries such as Manufacturing and Banking.   <br /> <br />Anyway, from the concrete examples illustrated to the insights on how to improve one's retailing business, this book has definitely thrown enough value to sound the alarm bells in my head.
B00000JCB2|1.0|3 Dollar Billz ya'll was a great album, being that it was very raw, rugged and featured tight lyrics and delivery. I would say that 3 dollar billz is one of the best albums of the 90's. <br />Significant Other however, is so bogged down with trying to be too thuggish and too hard that the album just comes up very weak. I'm not trashing Limp Bizkit for being Limp Bizkit, I am focusing merely on their music. 3 Dollar Billz featured crazy guitar riffs, awesome bass lines and drumming, and intense, frenzied lyrical delivery, not to mention tight rap/metal songs. <br />Significant other features a rapper who thinks he is the s##t and a band who seems like they barely enjoy what they are doing. In other words, lackluster and overtly boring. Metal does exist on this album, but it takes a back seat to the wannabe rap vibe that permeates this album. I'm sorry to all of the rap/metal fans in the world, but this album is not as great as some people state that it is. Fred Durst's lyrics suck, bad rhymes and no interesting lyrical content(being angry and rapping about it can only go so far until it gets really annoying). <br />The music seems tired and un-inspired, trying to be too much of a commerical thing than it should. But I suppose since the band blew up and became an MTV staple after their cover \\"faith\\", what else do you expect? Over-killed by guests artists(when obviously this was done to make the record more \\"rap\\"), and geared toward angry suburban kids who wear only khaki pants, black t-shirts and backwards red baseball caps, Significant Other falls on many deaf ears, and could quite possibly be one of the worst albums of all time, aside from the rest of Limp Bizkits discography.
6305609705|5.0|To call Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW one of the greatest films ever made is a major understatement.  It's filmmaking perfection - brilliant, powerful, and beautiful.  From the chilling opening - helicopters flying through the Vietnamese jungle, setting it aflame, while The Doors' \\"The End\\" plays - to the now-classic closing (\\"The horror ... the horror ...\\"), it's an unforgettable journey into the darkest reaches of the human heart.  It's unquestionably the greatest and most horrifying film made about the Vietnam War; it may be the best war movie ever.  Some could even argue that APOCALYPSE NOW is the greatest film of all time.   <br /> <br />The plot is ingenious.  During the seemingly endless Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a former CIA agent, is given a voluntary mission; as he's been searching for work, he gladly accepts.  His mission: float up the Nung River in a Navy boat and terminate (with extreme prejudice) Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a once-brilliant man who has gone insane and set himself up as a God and the leader of a Vietnamese tribe.  As Willard sails further and further up the river, his surroundings and the violence become more and more terrible until he finally reaches the heart of darkness.   <br /> <br />Though APOCALYPSE NOW was, in fact, loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novel HEART OF DARKNESS, it is truly Francis Ford Coppola's movie.  The story behind the film is legendary; it was turned into an equally-legendary documentary entitled HEARTS OF DARKNESS: A FILMMAKER'S APOCALYPSE.  From the start the film was plagued by production problems, to the point where Coppola threatened to commit suicide six or seven times.  Marlon Brando showed up on the set without having read Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS or the Coppola/John Milius screenplay, demanding a large sum of money, and severely overweight.  Filming ran for an incredible 16 months, and editing lasted for roughly two years.  Paramount Pictures nicknamed the film\\"Apocalypse When?\\".  Audiences, critics, studios, and Coppola himself thought that the film would wind up as a disaster, a horrible film that would signal the end of everyone involved.  Needless to say, they were horribly wrong. <br /> <br />The film is a masterpiece.  More than a film, it's a reflection on humanity and the evil within.  Never has the Vietnam War looked so horrifyingly inhumane.  Coppola really makes the point that Vietnam was not so much a war as it was a massacre.  The most terrifying scene of all involves the slaying of a group of innocent Vietnamese fishermen.  Soldier Chef (Frederic Forrest) reluctantly searches the boat for any weapons; the tension is built up while Chef searches as his commander shouts at him and he shouts back furiously.  A Vietnamese woman suddenly runs towards him shouting, and a young American soldier (14-year-old Laurence Fishburne) guns down not only her, but every one else on the boat.  As it turns out, the woman was running for her dog.  All those innocent human beings were murdered because the woman wanted to protect her puppy.  And it gets worse - Chef points out that the woman is still alive.  As he begins hauling her on the ship, Willard walks over and shoots her in the heart.  \\"I told you not to stop the damn ship,\\" he says. <br /> <br />As far as filmmaking goes, APOCALYPSE NOW is perfection.  There's excellent acting from all involved; Robert Duvall is especially great as an eccentric commander who likes to surf and, in one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, blasts Wagner's \\"The Ride of the Valkyries\\" while attacking enemy villages.  A skinny, bespectacled Harrison Ford has a brief appearance, and Dennis Hopper - in another wonderful role, this time as a photojournalist - pops up toward the end.  The score is fittingly eerie and mechanical, a synthesized horror composed by Coppola and his father, Carmine Coppola.  Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is nothing short of spectacular.  APOCALYPSE NOW also features what may be the greatest lighting in film history, particularly toward the end of the film.   <br /> <br />Still, despite all this cinematic greatness, APOCALYPSE NOW is more an experience than a film.  It's a chilling, brilliant voyage from start to finish.  \\"Never get off the boat,\\" a character states at one point in the film.  For we, the audience, APOCALYPSE NOW is the boat, and once we do take the inevitable step off, we will never be the same.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Whether you want to relate this to political propaganda or not, this movie is powerful. It leaves a lasting impression that resonates with the viewer long after the movie ends.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I thought this movie was great even though the story was predictable.  It kept me entertained every minute!  One of my favorite scenes was when the two Italian cars got all dressed up to cheer at a race, and I almost died laughing since they looked just like the Italians we saw here in Germany during the month of World Cup games.<br /><br />I also love that Pixar takes pride in the details.  The non-talking characters in the movie were just as well thought out and lovingly crafted as the \\"human\\"  characters.<br /><br />Another great thing about Pixar is they continue to entertain even after the story is over. The credits in this one were especially great. If you see it don't even think about leaving the movie theater until the credits are done rolling.<br /><br />And finally, I was impressed by the number of notable people they had play caricatures of themselves. Mario Andretti, Richard Petty and his wife Lynda, Bob Costas, Darrell Waltrip, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were all in there. (Not that I knew this until I checked out the IMDB entry for the movie, but it's still cool. I'm sure there are other famous names that I just don't know since I'm not a NASCAR fan.) Aside from racing names, they also had Click and Clack from NPR, as well as Jay Leno playing a TV talk show car called \\"Jay Limo.\\"<br /><br />Genius!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have to say I am really surprised at some of the reviews - makes me wonder if you guys actually \\"get\\" Tool? It is so disappointing that so many fans actually seem to miss the point totally. <br /> <br />Yes, they are a great \\"Rock\\" band, but are also so much more than that; Tool ususally have spiritual, political or social (ALWAYS thought provoking) lyrics and the music is at times simply a way to compliment the enlightenment they are trying to share with us. <br /> <br />Try listening to the whole album in correct order with the lights out after a long meditation; but if you don't get it, then you just don't get it...and probably never will - just enjoy the music and forget the fact they are trying to tell you something really BIG. Especially with 10,000 days  :)

B00025ETIW|5.0|I'm a huge classic rock fan I listen to Styx, Queen, and Chicago. But when I heard I'm Not Okay (I Promise) I started to get into it as it started as they started singing it started to win me over. And then when the guitar solo hit me I was knocked dead. I yelled FINALLY! I will tell you this right now this is not emo music this is modern rock at its finest. It kind of reminds me of Queen. But the one thing I love the most about these guys is that unlike so much of the music world today these guys form a union beetween lyrics and instruments and it sounds great. They know how to play and sing in a very mature manner and it truly is beatiful. I had tears of joy when I heard them and I had to buy their album. Thank you guys for allowing me to enjoy some of today's music. FINALLY!!!!
B00005JNTX|2.0|what a dumb movie, don't see what the hype is about? Don't waste your time!
0790729369|2.0|The DVD was okay and I needed it for a gift (which I was late for - my fault).  I received it in 5 days but it arrived totally smashed.  It was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing.  The outside of the package was marred but not ripped open.  But when I opened it I was horrified that the entire case was crushed. I delicately took it apart and it seemed that the DVD was untouched so I put it in another generic case that I had around the house.  That was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and I couldn't fit it in my case.  Because I was late with my gift, I didn't have time to send it back to you.  The price was right, the service was quick, just bulk up on your shipping a little.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This movie is original and funny, with descent suspense and twists.  Robert Downy plays Harry, a man from out east who had a less than desirable past thrust into the hollywood scene by accidently stubling into a casting call after a botched robbery.  The role that the call was for is a detective part, he manages to get selected, and then has to shadows Val Kilmer, AKA Gay Perry, a detective who gets pushed into his biggest case that he never expected, dragging Harry with him.  Along the way they meet Michelle Monaghan at a party, who is an old friend of Harry's from Indiana.  Of course, the stories continue to get more conveluded and intertwined as the body count goes up, to an ending that is a nice surprise.  Funny, entertaining, suspenseful, a movie that could have been promoted more by the company.  Rent it now, buy it now, either way, you will be happy.
B00005JP0P|2.0|The Ant Bully (John A. Davis, 2006)<br /><br />Davis (Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius) returns with this Pixar-esque kids' flick that is, in reality, not for kids. Nothing is sacred here, and not terribly much of it is funny. Who decided potty humor was a worthwhile place to go in a movie aimed at the preteen set?<br /><br />Lucas Nickle (The Backyardigans' Zack Tyler) is a kid who gets bullied by the neighborhood lugnut and his toadies. Looking for something he can bully in turn, he happens upon an ant's nest. The problem is, ants are just as intelligent (if not more so) as humans, and Zoc (Nicolas Cage), the nest's wizard, concocts a potion that will make Lucas ant-sized so he can pay for his crimes. The colony's queen (Meryl Streep) decrees that Lucas will not be allowed to return to the human world until he learns to think like an ant, and your stock fish-out-of-water comedy plot begins.<br /><br />To be fair, the second half of the movie, when Lucas is starting to get the idea, has some good one-liners. But it's not enough to overcome the vapid, vaguely offensive first half. **

B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the Holy didn't start Led Zeppelin's fascination with Tolkien-like imagry, but it sure had been perfected by the release of this wonderful album. From the beginning to the end, it plays like a sunset streaking across the sky. Rocking songs mix with slower ballads and make a work of art that is as close to perfection that music can be. While 'Houses' may not contain as many singles as Led Zeppelin IV it makes up for it in it's long, sweeping epics and poetic, mystical lyrics. A classic in every sense of the word; a must own for any true rock fan.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|AEon Flux (Karyn Kusama, 2005)<br /><br />I'm a very big fan of both Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) and Charlize Theron (Monster). So when I found out that the big-screen adaptation of Peter Chung's wonderful animated series AEon Flux would star Theron and be directed by Kusama, I was hopeful that the film would have some teeth to it. Alas, as everyone in the world but me seemingly knew, I was wrong.<br /><br />Theron plays the title character, who lives in a world whose five million inhabitants all live in a single city, the world outside having \\"gone back to nature.\\" The city has been ruled by a benevolent dictator for most of those four hundred years, but things have started getting a little weird, and a rebel faction, the Monicans, has sprung up. AEon Flux is a member of the Monican resistance, and she gets an assignment from her handler (Fargo's Frances MacDormand) to assassinate said dictator, Trevor Goodchild (xXx's Martin Csokas). Except that, well, something makes her hesitate, and that something is the vast coincidence upon which the entire film turns. And once you accept that fact that you've been handed a vast coincidence, the whole thing simply falls apart, becoming nothing more than an excuse for a mindless shoot-em-up with all sorts of nifty special effects. (Sophie Okonedo's character, who has had her feet replaced with a second set of hands, is the recipient of, by far, the coolest of the film's effects.)<br /><br />So, the short answer: the only reason to watch this film has to do with Charlize Theron and a few yards of skintight leather. Which, I admit, could have even made Reds worth watching, really. But be prepared for the fact that Girlfight this ain't. **

1594481717|4.0|In a sense, Pink is the Malcolm Gladwell of the brain. He has synthesised a lot of stuff into one place. Fortunately 'Whole New Mind', unlike 'Blink', only misses the point in some areas while getting most of it right. His treatment of design is a little 'breathless' and I would recommend reading Virginia Postrel's Substance of Style for a more hard edged treatment. Stephen Denning's work on leadership story telling contradicts the value of the rich narrative that Pink espouses. The rest of the book is first rate and I would recommend this book to anyone serious about increasing their economic value - I've given it to my 16 year old daughter to read as she embarks on a path towards the holy grail of an MFA.
0689859368|3.0|Holly Black and Tony DeTerlizzi, The Field Guide (Simon and Schuster, 2003)<br /><br />Black and DiTerlizzi hand us the first (of five) volumes ni a young adult fantasy series here. It's short (much shorter than, say, any volume of the Series of Unfortunate Events), readable, and gets things off to a good start.<br /><br />The Graces-- twins Jared and Simon, older sister Mallory, and mother XX-- inherit an old, run-down mansion from a recently deceased uncle. As the kids' father has just left, mom takes this as a sign that a fresh start is to be had, and packs up the kids and all their belongings and heads down. The kids are not at all fond of their new habitat, but they soon find all sorts of mysteries to occupy their time, most of which involve mischief (all of which gets blamed on Jared). Things take a turn for the weirder, however, when Jared, exploring the attic, finds a book written by his Great-Uncle Spiderwick, a field guide to the world of faerie.<br /><br />There's not terribly much here. With such a short book, there's barely time to lay out the characterization and get the plot rolling. The authors do it, though in a bare-bones kind of way. No matter, it's good enough reading to ensure most readers will go on to the other four books. Have them at the ready when you crack this one open, though. It goes fast. *** ½
B000G759LW|3.0|The 1st CD is by far the better of the two. All the songs on the 1st CD are masterpiece except for the last track \\"Thank You.\\" I think the idea behind \\"Thank You\\" was well thought of but the result came across as being too self absorbed. It could have been a great track without the voice recordings of her fans and just Christina singing thanking them. CD1 is also better because it's more cohesive. CD2 to me is just all over the place. I guess the circus theme at the beginning of the 2nd CD tells us that Christina is playing different characters here (as if you were at the circus). This is just my guess. She goes from playing the Andrew Sisters (Candyman) to Jessica Rabbitt (Naughty Nasty Boy) to Fiona Apple? (Mercy on Me). Having said that, I do love \\"Mercy on Me.\\" She sings it very convincingly. I think it's the best song on the 2nd CD. \\"Candyman\\", \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Save Me from Myself\\" are really great as well, except the last track \\"The Right Man.\\" She fails miserably on this one. Overall, it's a great album but the last track on each CD (\\"Thank You\\" and \\"The Right Man\\") could have been eliminated.

0553582461|5.0|This is a masterpiece! Fool's Fate isn't just the end of a very good trilogy (The Tawny Man), but binds together Hobb's previous 8 books (that is the Farseer and Liveship Traders trilogies) in such an easy way that in the end it seemed to me that I read a single novel. <br />Praise also for the way characters like Fool, Wintrow or Chade  were developed! <br /> <br />Personal comment on the story (spoilers): <br />in the end I was so sorry for Beloved that I found myself angry with Fitz!  <br />Maybe Fitz shouldn't have had the chance to get back to Molly after all ...did he deserve it after all he did to her? And it seems to me that Burrich's death was there only to offer Fitz a \\"clean way out\\" without betraying the man who had raised him as a father (this death -the way it is- is maybe the only flaw I found in Hobb's trilogies).
B00005V1Y0|5.0|STRICTLY BALLROOM is a wonderfully campy film that I can watch over and over and enjoy it as much the 10th time (heck, I may have already seen it more times than that!) as I did the first. I'm not into dancing, but this movie has such fun with it that I am considering it as a new interest. However, do not be mistaken about the film's real intent. It is an excellent piece of satire that has relevance to all aspects of life. By the way, I am a MAN who loves John Wayne and Clint Eastwood westerns. STRICTLY BALLROOM may have a title that seems to peg it as a \\"chick flick\\", and indeed women will love it, but it's good fun for EVERYONE.
1416524800|1.0|This is only the second Dan Brown book I've read, \\"Da Vinci Code\\" being the first, but reading it was like deja vu.  Again, the main character is a woman, who again has issues with her father figure.  Again the heroine finds her self stuck in a race against the clock with a handsome scientist/scholar.  Again Dan Brown serves up a couple of obvious villians and again the real villian is someone who the characters thought they could trust.  There are obvious differences in the story line, but the plotline is so similar to the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" that none of it is \\"thrilling\\" and the only reason it's a \\"page turner\\" is because you're hoping to be suprised.<br />My main problem with the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" (notice I say main, not only) was the bait and switch method which Brown used to hide the true antagonist of the story.  Here he does it again, but he's not fooling anybody.<br />Bottom line: If you enjoyed the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and then suffered amnesia you will love \\"Deception Point.\\"<br />If you like \\"thrillers\\" that aren't that thrilling, you'll love \\"Deception Point.\\"<br />If you want to read something that is almost exactly like something you already read, you'll love \\"Deception Point.\\"<br />If you own the same shirt in several different colors, you'll love \\"Deception Point.\\"
0375751513|4.0|When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery.  Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them.  Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.<br /><br />THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil.  The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society.  In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\"  Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins.  Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery.  Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin.  Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book.  When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity.  He states that the contrary is true.  Art must not be used for betterment.  He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered.  What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.<br /><br />Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion.  Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian.  But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher.  It was hard enough the way it was to do that.<br /><br />Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one.he consequences as eloquently as this one. <br />
B00000JPHD|5.0|DRACULA(1931) is still the most authentic and respected cinematic interpretation of Bram Stoker's classic novel in existence today. The story begins in Transylvania where Count Dracula is visited by an Englishman named Renfield who arranges for the transfer of Carfax Abbey in London to the Count.After arriving in England, Dracula first turns a young lady into a vampire and then sets his sights on the girl's best friend, Mina Seward. Meanwhile, the first young woman's condition is accurately diagnosed by Dr. Van Hesling who warns Mina's father and her fiance of the danger posed by Count Dracula. The suspense that follows centers on efforts to protect Mina and to destroy Dracula.    Bela Lugosi was forever identified with his role as Count Dracula and his impersonation of the evil Count was often imitated by comics and other entertainers.The cast also included Helen Chandler, David Manners,Dwight Frye,Edward Van Sloan,Herbert Bunston and Frances Dade. The movie was directed by Todd Browning.
0375760067|5.0|In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE.  In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works.  When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.<br /><br />Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends.  His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child.  At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster.  An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him.  Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge.  The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was.  Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances.  At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE.But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance.

B00005KHJM|4.0|An upright English police sergeant, Howie (Edward Woodward), from the mainland is sent to an isolated island known as Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper). The residents of the isle, including Lord Summerisle himself (Christopher Lee) seem reluctant to assist Howie and it becomes apparent that they are in fact trying to frustrate his investigation. Also, Howie quickly discovers Summerisle is a place far removed from what he is accustomed to. It is a place where pagan pageants and customs of the past are practiced and flourishing. Everyone seems to want Howie to leave, but he is a righteous man and he can't leave until he's solved the disappearance. What he ends up discovering is something far more chilling than he would have ever guessed.<br /><br />THE WICKER MAN is usually classified as being a horror movie, but it's much more than that. The film shares elements of the horror genre, but it's more of a mish-mash between suspense/mystery/musical/horror. Edward Woodward does a good job at portraying the film's protagonist and central character, Sergeant Howie. Opposing Howie, is Lord Summerisle, portrayed by the delightful Christopher Lee. Lee has said that his role in this movie was one of his favorites of all time (he agreed to appear in the film for free) and it is a delight to watch Lee strut, prance, and dance throughout his time on screen.<br /><br />The film was filmed in the early 70s and therefore shares some of the color of that time. Nevertheless, unlike many films of that period, it has aged quite well. The film's ending is what makes it so horrifying. Yet, upon first viewing and without knowing anything else about the movie, I was able to figure out the big secret about a fourth of the way through the movie. Whatever the case, THE WICKER MAN is a delightful and unique film from the 1970s that is well worth the time to watch.<br /><br />This DVD edition includes a very informative documentary entitled, THE WICKER MAN ENIGMA, the theatrical trailer, various tv and radio spots, and a sample film biography of some of the movie's main actors.entitled, THE WICKER MAN ENIGMA, the theatrical trailer, various tv and radio spots, and a sample film biography of some of the movie's main actors.
