B003SHUMRI|3.0|This movie was clearly a showcase of Channing Tatum's deliciousness! He's a fabulous dancer, and nothing less than the sexiest man alive. Great movie for a girls night, great movie for a night stuck in bed with the flu. It was enjoyable, and entertaining.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it made you think - what if this was the real reason for the war.

B009FBX5M0|3.0|Good soundtrack, as far as soundtracks go.  Good thing I saw the movie, so I could keep up. However, the Adele song is not on here.  I had to buy separately.

B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Bourne as a pill popper. Same story as previous movies. Different locals. The AK scenes are primal.  Chases are intense.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|enjoyed the show.  the streaming was excellent. no problems with any of the movie.  blah blah blah nothing more to say
B009A9BEHU|5.0|Everything about it was just great! I felt like I was at the concert all over again. The film pretty much was everything I expected it to be. If you really enjoy Coldplay and their music, you will enjoy the film as well.
B007WTFWJ6|5.0|Many examples, many analogies, ways to grow up in coding. The author explains what I was looking for years since I started coding.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Just felt a bit far fetched to me. Albeit an unpredicable plot towards the end, think it just got too much in terms of the story line...
B00138KEH2|5.0|My brother sent me an Amazon MP3 download credit for Rage Against The Machine's XX. I listened to the samples and knew I wouldn't listen to RATM, so as I was scrolling the \\"Customers Who Bought This Also Bought\\" listings under RATM I saw Audioslave.<br /><br />After selecting and listening to the samples, I immediately used the credit and got Audioslave. Great trade, as I get the musicianship of RATM and the non-political vocals of Chris Cornell, one of rock's premier singers. Fantastic collection of songs at the amazing price of $2.99...thanks brother and Amazon!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Wow...The rush of excitement and anticipation that I`m feeling right now after finishing the book is flaring inside me like a bowl of fire!<br />Such an amazing book to read for the readers who seek a book that would keep them on the edge of their seat. The book is very well written and it`s not like one of those \\"the-fearless-boy-who-saves-the-day\\" kind of books. The book contains real emotions and feelings the characters go through the entire book and he doesn't over do it.<br />An amazing read for everyone who loves, thriller, action packed books.<br />It loses one star because the book at some point becomes a little boring, but that only lasts for a couple of pages then it`s over, but sometimes it does wanna make you skip a couple of lines.<br />Overall, an amazing book that kept me up all night.
B005NFJAXU|5.0|Supernatural: Season 1-6<br />Season 1-6 It was a great season, arrived in good shape.  Our family really likes supernatural.  We watch it together. Thank you
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I picked up this book after seeing it recommended based on my read of Halderman's Forever War. I wanted a new space battle science fiction book in similar vein, and I was not disappointed. The story of John Perry works on several levels, from a fun, if somewhat campy science fiction war action tale to an introspective view into what it means to be human, to cope with aging and to deal with life. Overall a good read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read and edit for a living, so in order for me to want to read outside of my job, a book really needs to grab me or I'll lose interest quickly. This book had me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning. The pace is incredible quick, and the plot line keeps you guessing about what really happened and who is telling the truth. The language can be a bit raw, but it is brilliantly written and completely captivating for mystery/suspense lovers. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played in my life I can never have played a better game than this one and I can never get off of it
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|My teenage son loves Bruno Mars, and so this was one of his favorite Christmas gifts, it is great when they like what the get!
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I read Old Man's War, Ghost Brigades and the Last Colony in rapid succession. I loved the original, so I dove into The Last Colony with enthusiasm. On the whole, the story was a good one, it was fairly compelling and easy to read. It fell short, somehow, in the characters. The voices of Jane and John just didn't read true to me. Somehow John was just not very interesting other than as a pivot point around which the story revolved. Still, overall I enjoyed the plot and the finale was satisfying.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book. A involved read. I felt what the characters felt. Amazing. Waiting for the next book. Would recommend.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Seriously loved this movie. The service was great, it worked right away. I would refer all of my friends to use amazon to rent movies.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Yep we love this series too.  It is entertaining and we watch it as a family sometimes.  We all try to keep up with each other.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|If you like Glee, you'll enjoy this movie, as it's a variation of the same, but 'a capella' all the way, which makes for some nice performances from different groups competing at the college level.  some good, hip music, with some highly talented performances are the highlights of an otherwise 'weakish' plot development.  Character development is so-so, and then there is the incorporation of excessive &#34;chunking&#34; in a couple of scenes that I don't find contribute anything at all desirable to the overall picture.  i would give it 3.5 stars if I could.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|My husband and I decided to watch this movie based on the recommendation from a friend as well as a review. Found it very entertaining and had some good humor as well. The cast did a great job in their roles and there were some poignant moments too.<br />I recommend this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is great for kids of all ages I'm 17 and still love games like these they are very addicting!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Nothing but a friend/lover like holder. This book was amaze-balls. It encompassed every emotion a girl goes through even with the dark past that sky endures. I loved every second of it and wish there was more but it didn't need more. I was satisfied with the wanting because I realized what I want is a love like sky and holders. Recommend this to any and everyone.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|If you do, then this one's for you!  Seen it thrice now, and enjoy it every time.  It's just so well done.  Both Julie and Julia are played incredibly believably making this film one for the Classics shelf.  Meryl Streep is at her best, playing Julia Childs with uncanny credulity, and the cooking and the romantic challenges intertwine to form a well developed, well acted, and well done film in all aspects.  Thoroughly enjoyable, and extremely well directed and acted.  Really funny parts as well.  Love it!!!

B007ZKY7XO|5.0|Well, it would be if I really danced. Still, I have bought all the Scissor Sisters albums out so far and I have never yet been disappointed. Call it Dance or Electronica, it is fun.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is a great movie nobody ever saw. I believe this to be from the terrible trailer that spelled all action and no character.<br /><br />Dredd contains a perfect balance of action and people talking(some would call this dialog). simply put the main judges were mysterious to the end and I didn't hate them ever. The movie also pushes the SciFi genre by adding gadgets and powers shown in a new way. Robocop's gun is no longer my dream gun.<br /><br />A sequel would be nice if this time around it isn't hidden behind a crappy trailer. 9/10 stars because the beginning of the movie was a bit slow . Plot left me more satisfied than the raid did. Watch Dredd.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|I got this movie for my aunt and she loves it so cute and funny at the same time. :-)
B00005V7CT|1.0|I purchased this DVD for a friend.  She said it wouldn't play in her two dvd players.  I took it to my house and found it would play in my computer but not in either of my TVs.  With some research I discovered that DVDs are coded to different regions to help prevent piracy.  This particular version was coded for region 2.  My friend doesn't have a computer so I guess I'm stuck with it.  The movie is probably okay, the fomat isn't.  A word of caution ................. check before you purchase a DVD from another country.
0871404133|5.0|We live today in a very complex material culture. But this has not always been so. It was not preordained in any way. Science is a major part of this culture and it is the best tool we have yet devised for understanding ourselves and our environment.<br /><br />Dr. Wilson writes in a nice clear way about developments in social complexity from his perspective from the life sciences. These are the processes that have led us to be who and where we now are, complex creations of Nature bound within a complex culture of our own creation.<br /><br />Anyone who would benefit from a clear statement of just what the life sciences are really trying to teach us will find this a very worthwhile read.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|thought it was great, loved it.  complex enough, great graphics, interesting story...another excellent big fish game.  looking forward to the next one oot
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I love this movie is cute and funny as well. it show any one can love someone I recommend it.

0399160450|5.0|As we all know Tom Clancy has written a number of tremendous political action books, but we have also seen the quality fall off a bit over the last few years.  With this book, I can see that he is totally back in form with some help from coauthor, Mark Greaney.  The only thing I did not like about the book was its title.  What is really remarkable about this book is Clancy's ability to clearly see our future.  He has done this before in 1994, when in \\"Debt of Honor\\" he presented us with the first fictionalized version of 9/11 which none of our multi-trillion dollar defense intelligence establishment paid any attention to.  Well Mr. Big Government, Tom Clancy is giving you a second chance to prove your worth by very clearly describing the big Cyber Warfare attack that is coming in our future.  I can only hope that a few of the idiots that run these intelligence paper pushing organizations in Washington will pay attention to this threat along with the EMP attack threat described by William R. Forstchen in \\"One Second After\\".<br /><br />With regard to the book itself, it was fast moving throughout.  I loved how the Chinese enemy is painted in detail with all of its sophisticated capabilities in cyber warfare, just look at our universities and private companies to see their computer science intellectual capabilities.  His descriptions of air and naval warfare seem to be spot on.  I loved the \\"Honey Pot\\" trap that unfolded in Beijing and how industrial and PLA espionage combine into one thing.  Also the action that happened in Hong Kong with the Triads was very exciting although I am not sure a real seal team could have gotten out of such a tight spot.  Jack Ryan as President makes me wish that we had this kind of person in the White House today.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not usually my type of book due to the graphic nature but loved the relationship between Christian and Ana and the whole back story of Christians past and all he overcomes being in love with Ana it's a great love story I put them with my favorite love story couples!! It's a great trilogy couldn't put them down from book one to book three! Definitely books to read again! Loved it!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Loved this film -- the humor, the insights, the sadness, the joy.  Great execution of a true story about a difficult subject, which became human and touching through the actors, directors and every element of the film.  Reminds us that love and intimacy is not about sex, or even about having a perfect (or fully functioning) body.  Highly recommended.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like this program because it allows me to check my emails when I am not able to get to my laptop.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A little slow to get into but once you do, quite intriguing.  Certainly a different style.  A lot of my friends either couldn't get into it or loved it, about 50-50/
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was one of those books that kept drawing me back. I became invested in the lives of the characters and though the story structure seemed complex I wanted to walk their journeys with them.  I let the author lead rather than trying to figure it all out and I'm glad I did.  I will look for more books by this author.  It was a lovely ride.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Not your typical documentary... this movie tells the story of a very special sound board and the impact it had on so many musicians, not just Dave Grohl. Movie keeps your attention the entire time plus your head will bob up & down with the music!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I bought this movie because it is one of my favorite movies,I can watch it year round and not get tired of it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game. My kids can't stay off of it lol. I truly thank you for making this game. Keep them coming.

B002QY9RMA|3.0|A super PAC known as Elect a New Congress wants the \\"constitutional overthrow of the U.S. government\\" and a \\"new American revolution\\". They also claim that Beyonc&eacute; and her husband Jay-Z are Illuminati...<br /><br />Well, I always suspected there was *something* strange about Beyonc&eacute;. I mean, she once worked with Lady Gaga, who was exposed as Illuminati by 16-year old whistleblower Sarah \\"Looney\\" at Youtube two years ago.<br /><br />Not!<br /><br />Frankly, I'm surprised by the large number of non-trolling citizens of the ex-Republic who believe in *this* particular conspiracy theory. Are we to believe these valiant fighters of the true grail, there is also a connection between the pop diva doing a triangle sign, and the fact that half of the lights in the Superdome went out shortly afterwards. This was apparently G-d showing his displeasure with the Satan worship of Madame Beyonc&eacute;?!<br /><br />I knew Ms. Looney's parody was good, but I didn't know it was *that* good, LOL.<br /><br />Presumably, there are no other problems to address this week? And no, I'm not talking about Mali, Syria, Iraq, the fiscal cap, the budget hat or the welfare hood. And definitely not about David Cameron's anti-EU speech (thank you, Dave).<br /><br />I'm (of course!) referring to the Oreo Outage Tweet, the banned SodaStream ad, the cancellation of the Ricki Lake show, and the Ashtar Command's new string of wacky non-reviews. Oh, and the terrible technical problems in the Swedish Melody Festival.<br /><br />So what's all this stuff about Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z? Sheesh, what are people thinking??? I'm almost inclined to believe that it's all a conspiracy, making us forget about the world's REAL problems!!!
B005JABSB6|5.0|&#34;wow&#34; was the prevailing comment from my friends watching the SuperBowl in 3D with these glasses. Of course it was simulated 3D, as the game wasn't broadcast in my area in true 3D, but the simulation was still awesome!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept my attention.  It was dirty, but it had a story behind it that wanted you to keep reading to see if he was going to hurt her or not.  I wouldn't recommend it to anybody because of the content.  They would have to decide that for themselves.  Well written.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Entertaining for adults as well, not a home run but<br />if you want a film that is a cute story, then watch it....
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very good book! There were pieces of the story that continued to surprise me as they were revealed.  It was an excellent story about overcoming, surviving, feeling and loving. Also a great reminder that you should seldom believe all of what you hear and only about half of what you &#34;see&#34;!
B003DTMUOE|4.0|Uno de los mejores libros de Pablo lectura que te transporta y te hace valorar lo que tienes para poder alcanzar tus sueños.
0440244412|5.0|Wow. This series had lots of twists and turns along the way and kept me guessing up to practically the last word, but I wouldn't change a thing about the ending. Except perhaps that I hope it isn't the end. After finishing off this series in less than a week, I can definitely say that I loved it all! Can't wait to read other books by KMM, as I am now a huge fan.<br /><br />I recommend this book, and the series it completes to all 18+ readers of fantasy, paranormal, and/or romance. It has a liberal sprinkling of cursing, and some sex scenes. All to the better in my opinion!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Easy interface and fully explorable definitions; makes searching and learning easy.  I look forward to coming across opportunities to use it.
B0015DWJ8W|3.0|Decent book about life and thoughts. I'm not sure anyone should follow the authors pattern but this was a decent read about one person's experiences.

B0055Q5F36|5.0|Perfect fit for my straight talk phone. I had to hunt high and low for a protector for it. The only knock is the screen protector film is a little loose around the edges but I think that is from buying from amazon warehouse

B004GHNIRK|4.0|Loved this story but found the lengthy war battles too much for me, so I would skip the details on that.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. I would recommend this movie to everybody, and I have. If your a movie lover or you just love a good story this movie is for you. I enjoyed every second. The music was great, along with the shots. PLEASE watch this movie!
B00170I7GG|4.0|The sound on this streaming was very bad.  Many of the background sounds (like the radio music each morning which was the featured part of this film) did not come through at a decible level it should have been.  Disappointed with this streaming quality.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We just discover this series and so happy we could order the earlier shows. We have had Abbey viewing parties.  Just got this and can not wait to watch the 3rd series with our Abbey fan friends .
B001U0HAZM|5.0|Another overlooked film, this one is a meditation on the destructive power of guilt.<br /><br />Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznik, a machinist who hasn't slept in over a year. His only &#34;friends&#34; are a prostitute and a single mother who works as a waitress at the diner the Reznik frequents at night after his shift at the machine shop. He has lost a lot of weight, in fact both the prostitute and the waitress tell him that if he gets any thinner, he wouldn't exist. He begins to hallucinate and begins to see people who may or may not be real.<br /><br />I've watched this film several times. The first time, I didn't figure out what was going on until the end, when the film reveals Trevor's dark secret. Each subsequent view reveals more details that I overlooked on previous viewings.<br /><br />Christian Bale lost one third of his body weight to play this role and the results are very disturbing. He looks like a flesh-covered skeleton. In places, this film is very hard to watch.<br /><br />I would recommend this film for anyone who likes suspense and or creepy films.
B005LAII80|5.0|Remember when you where young and under 18 years of age? Remember being that age and you watched your first rated R movie and it blew your mind at the violence and action? Remember how Disney movies felt after watching your first rate R move? That is this movie. So true to the original spirit of the comic and the soul of the collect of stories that this movie is a must see for any fan of action and cinema.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I find it awesome but multiplayer does not work but otherwise itis extremely awesome and sweet and  cool and did i mention its AWESOME

B004W0IRW2|5.0|Having not read Austen before seeing the many theatrical productions of her work, I can truly say her works reflect everything I have read or heard about. Now, on to a new Austen novel.....

B005F9TQ9C|4.0|this is one of Dylan most collectible works.  if I understood them right, that this was the album they were buying, and what they say they can sell it for.  Pawn Stars was trying to get 75.00 for it.  somebody may get screwed on that price.  this is why I usually check out 2 on-line sites 1st.  Amazon is one of them.  amazon is a much better source for a lot of stuff.  this CD is good, but it can be had for much much less than even close to 75.00  Las-vegas? try on-line.  this is a good CD and readily available. a good recording.
B000002KK2|5.0|This is the album that made Rickie Lee Jones one of the most auditioned artists in High End Audio showrooms.  These are excellent performances in very good sound.  If you don't already own this album in some format, buy a copy while they are still available.  At the asking price it's a steal.  This is an extraordinary album by a group of very very talented performers.  Would rate it higher than 5 stars if that were allowed.

0307730697|4.0|If you are looking to get and in-depth look at what it is like to be a United States Navy SEAL, please take note this Eric Blehm's \\"Fearless\\" is something completely different. Rather than insight into the Navy SEAL mindset, this book follows Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown from childhood to his heroic, but early, death.<br /><br />I was amazed at how deep the author was able to look into the life of Adam Brown. It was great to see somebody come from rock bottom to an admirable Navy SEAL. I know there are a number of people who feel that Adam Brown's past should have kept him out of the SEALs, but I am honored that this country was protected by such a great man. Despite being in a war zone, Adam Brown still found time to care for the innocent children - I don't think many people would be able to accomplish such a feat.<br /><br />I feel it necessary to add that even though much of Brown's spiritual journey was discussed, it was in no way preachy. I would have lost respect for the story if the goal was to convert readers, rather than share the life story of an amazing man.<br /><br />Although I did absolutely love and admire this book, it was difficult at times to follow. The author's writing style did not flow as well as it could. At times, it was very confusing as to who Blehm was talking about as he did often discuss another person other than Adam Brown. A closer edit would make this book flow so much more nicely.<br /><br />That being said, I offer my deepest condolences for the family of Adam Brown.<br /><br />It would have been an honor to have met him.<br /><br />Please note I received my copy of \\"Fearless\\" free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group in exchange for an honest review.
1250027624|5.0|If you enjoy Downton Abbey you will love the book.  Nice to see the actors speak out about the show and the parts they play.  Great companion piece to the DVD's for future people to see.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game \it is so addicting (in a good way) I  could not put my kindle down. this game for me is one of the best games I bought in a while and you know what the best part is ... it's free. I mean even if you don't like.the game (but u will adore it ( in a good way)) you wont be mad about spending a lot of money.  this game  also has a fast past to it which for me makes it better. so if u r looken for a good game GET THIS ONE really!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this book.  It consumed all of my free time until it was finished, and then I immediately purchased the second book and then after, the third.  I believe it is a must read for all ages.  And since the book is written is first person, you really get to feel the main character's pain, her struggles, and triumphs.
B009KHCT94|5.0|So, I got this over the holiday break and watched it with my parents while I was in town. They even enjoyed it. I thought it was just going to be a B movie, but it has much better quality than that.<br /><br />Some hilarious jokes and relatively good plot line (mostly because it was way better than I thought it would be). Little slow at the front, but gets pretty funny.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. There are multiple characters, daily challenges and missions. Keeps you engaged and involved!
B004WMKSH2|2.0|It was hard to sit through this movie as the screen was always so dark, much more than the others in this set. Also, the ending is rather abrupt, the movie does not stand alone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my kids and i enjoyed this game alot..need to play it often bcoz they keep beating me, LOL!<br /> We hope to have more free games to enjoy.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I love the Vorkosigan saga and am glad she is continuing.  The author just has a great way of telling a story.  Continues here- probably is helpful to have read the others up to this, to get the subplots and references to other characters- but still a good read all by itself!  Keep them Coming!!  please.
B001E9641K|5.0|I am a fan of the original US ticket to ride game and would give it 5 stars as well.  I gave my wife the Nordic Country version for Christmas.  It comes with larger, easier to shuffle cards than the smaller cards that came with the original game.  There are a couple of variations involving ferry and tunnel routes in this game compared to the original so that it plays differently but still fun.  The Scandinavian map play board is nice.  This game is for 2 or 3 players (the original can handle up to 5).

B00B49L7Y4|5.0|One of the best stories to come around in a long time. Rodriguez and his daughters are an inspiration. I hope that more people get a chance to see this film!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think the whole series is amazing, scary and sad all at the same time. Broke down in tears when Katniss yells at the cat and  says that her sisters dead and is never coming back in the 3 rd book. For some reason the series some how changed me. I talk to my self as if I am someone in a book. And some times I just think about the book rethinking things said. I just wish it it was Gale she marries not Petta. The night I finished the book I cried and in my dream I cried. Scary!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Highly addictive!  Love the app makes for hours of finding inspiration, whether crafts, recipes or dig projects. Also a fun way to waste time.
075669812X|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He enjoys playing with Legos and is enjoying reading this book as well.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|To me this book seemed to drag on and take a long time to get to the point.I kept thinking it would finish soon but the murderer still wasn't around the corner
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is absolutely addictive. PLEASE bring out more Kindle Fire levels. Great gameplay and the monsters are the best part.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|First of all, in full disclosure, I only downloaded ths app because it was free that day and honestly did not think I'd like it because my favorite games are word games.  I am a total word game junkie.  I figured I'd end up deleting it shortly after getting it, but surprised myself by returning to it again and again.  I play this almost every day, at least for a little while.  I like that you can return to it and not lose your place and that you can play some challenges over to challenge yourself for a better score.  This is a good brain stimulator and I recommend it.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Haven't watched this yet. My DVD player needs hooking up after moving furniture. I have enjoyed most of Kevin James' movies and his TV show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game because the prizes are great. The speed is just right and the select players list are fun looking.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I was happy to hear of a new bad religion album being released! Then I was even happier to hear it had fire in it! Worth giving this a spin!
B004Y042N8|2.0|I will be honest and say I downloaded this only because it was free and I got my money's worth.  This might be great and fun and challenging for somebody, but it's not my cup of tea.  I am a word game junkie and don't know why I thought I'd enjoy this, but I really don't.  On the positive side, I will have to say it truly is challenging after awhile.  So if this is the type of puzzle game you enjoy, I would recommend it to you.  As for myself, I will stick with word games and leave this to you because I've played it so little that I'm going to delete it.
0486446859|3.0|It goes without saying that  Rackham ranks among the best from the Golden Age of Illustration. But to truly appreciate his fine sense of line, composition and color, the reproductions need to be quite good. These are not. But what do you expect? It's a Dover book. Not exactly known for the high quality of their graphics, Dover books are cheap and they give you a lot of bang for your buck. This is certainly a good introduction to Rackham's work at a very reasonable price.
0061564893|5.0|My five star rating..  I am amazed at the Historical facts that lie beneath the seas and the oceans.  The booked is packed with the artifact locations and the knowledge that is know to us upon the lands.  What is unknown is what lies beneath the vast water ways in the world.  Galvin Menzies has certainly done his home work.  It reaffirms what is known and accepted and what is not seen but questioned every time the subject arises.  Challenge yourself and confirm the suspicions in your mind do some reading and know that someone did sail before Columbus and know who had the maps of the world prior to.  Galvin Menzies has certainly uncovered some historical finds and has opened a great many eyes as to what lies beneath the waters as we know them.  An excellent read.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Great game to pass the time on cold wintry day.  Also great while waiting for the train or at the airport.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I bought this after seeing the new movie and learning the music from it was not the full score..SO, if you want the most popular song....the one with do you hear the people sing on it..BUY THIS ONE!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's been a long time since I have loved a show this much!  Downton Abbey, you have stolen my heart and then broke it, but still have me longing for more.
0684857219|5.0|This book is the real deal.  It provides a history of the sport, training methods, training instructions, diet guidelines and a lot of good photos of the legends.  This book will help the novice for sure.  You will have to ask the pros if it helps them too but it certainly helped me.
B0090X4HES|5.0|A lot of diversity in his music. A different type of sound to be out of California. I enjoyed it. And it's still in my CD player now.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Get one of these and you will have the most versitile way to wake up know to humankind. It won't make going to work or school any easier, but wow, you can brag about having the coolest alarm system available.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much!  Such an experience it tell, and possible, not just a factionalized theory.<br />Looking forward to another book by this author.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|fun to whatch ,,, soap opera with history ,,,, I look forward to each episode ....  good production and actors
B008F9E306|5.0|What more could you expect from T.I.?  True artist. Good to see he can \\"go away\\" and still come back like he never left!
1416575464|5.0|This book is as great as the magazine was.  I like the premise decorating room by room, so you can start with ideas for one room and then go on to the next.  It is like a textbook, but nicer and is one of the best decorating books I have.
0805028846|4.0|There are a good number of examples and photographs in this book.  This is important for young artists who might need visual inspiration and clear step by step intructions.
0765325950|5.0|About half way through the book. It is meeting my expectations. Sorry that Arizona is starting to levy Sales tax on purchases thru Amazon. Looks like I am going to have to weigh my purchases to see if the lower costs at Amazon + Sales tax will be cheaper than elsewhere.
B003O86FMW|5.0|loved all three books! and loved reading them on my kindle fire!<br />suspense all the way through, never knew what would happen next!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Great fit, looks good. Bought it for for the extra protection it affords.<br />I will likely buy another for my girlfriend's Edge 800.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Plays smoothly.  Nice tools and options.  Would have liked to have several types of tiles to choose from.  One of the best versions available.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This was a gift that received rave reviews.<br /><br />Tells the story of the war in the Pacific in a different way
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this theme because it is so fascinating in a cool way. It makes me feel wild in my head.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks knows how to keep you engaged with the characters and the problems they face. I'm sure the movie will be great!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you enjoy puzzles you will love this game.  The boards get more challenging as you move through the levels.  I am still playing the free download, but will be willing to pay for the upgrade to the next levels.  If you do not enjoy a puzzle maze then this game is not for you.  I find it very entertaining to pass the time.
1611761182|4.0|Really long with an awful lot of names to try to keep track of.<br /><br />Not that the story was bad, but it is much too long for a typical 12 hour car ride.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love these themes that u have because there so enthusiastic, just just great. I can't believe they made a awesome game like this one.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I'll watch anything with Maggie Smith in , but with this cast it is a winner!<br />I'll be watching this over & over...can't wait!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. It's fun and a great way to kill time. Before you know it you will be trying to beat your friends high scores and having the time to your life.
B009GEDP26|5.0|My sister in law missed this particular Portion of the program and was thrilled to be able to watch it on my Kindle Fire
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and this game has lots of levels that are challenging and different from other Mahjong games I have<br />played before.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Discovered this book by dumb luck, when searching for something to read on my new kindle. Engaging & original, looking forward to reading more in this series and from this author.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|I read this book after I saw the preview for the movie of it that was being released. I enjoyed the book, however it wasn't the story line I was expecting from the movie trailer. I think I would have enjoyed it more had I not seen the movie trailer.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Unless you are 7 years old , this is a very boring and hard to manuver application. The game is redundant
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Not fine theater, but easy to watch, great cast that seems to be having a good time.......a fun and modern &#34;shootem up&#34;.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story just gets better as the drama continues.  Can't wait to start the 3rd book.  I just do not want it to end.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|today i heard the horrible news of chris kyle passing my prayers are with his family thank you for youre service and god bless america
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is fun addictive and takes the time up if your free or bored it is worth it to get for all ages
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I love the DVD of &#34;Rise of the Planet of the Apes.&#34;.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes incredible special effects.  The apes seem so real and are very human like.<br />the movie was very well cast, directed and the makeup and special effects are outstanding.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I read that the characters were in high school, I was skeptical to download the book, but boy am I glad that I did!<br /><br />It's hard for me to say that the hero was amazing, because his character is in high school (!), but man oh man, I wish there were a real, older version of this guy!  He was passionate, considerate, caring, gentle but rough, when need be, the seemingly perfect guy.  The story was maybe a little predictable after I started reading it, but I didn't care that what happened was what I thought would happen.  The book was so well written that it didn't matter to me, and I loved how strong the heroine was, especially for her age and what she went through.<br /><br />Definitely read this book, it is SO worth the money!!
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|A move I would have been disappointed in if I had rented I must say I am super disappointed that I bought it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much!! I am very glad that I got this game for free! It's great for kids and adults! It's awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is the best and most challenging game  in the w orld because the missions  are so hardworking i feel so incourged that i get soooo funky and thats why i downloaded Subway Surfers.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|All of the songs on this album warrant the 'Greatest Hits' by this group. I enjoy the variety of the types of songs and the writing of each of the songs - great~
B007SGM084|3.0|This book was interesting at some parts and dull in others. There were some things that I could not over look although I tried. Although  the characters American they used lots of British terms and the book used lots of the same adjectives for descriptions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great app iloooooooooooooooooave it have dun during it hey hey hey<br /><br />This I like do u like pie fun BlackOps2Q n shun mum fun
B004TI5N38|3.0|Good book for a getaway. John, the main character is almost too hard to relate to despite the  nuances of  his highly intelligent military family and some good background development of the author. I will read another in the series and see if I feel a greater connection with the characters.
B000HL2J0G|3.0|I was looking for a more recent episode, but decided to just watch this one.  The action all takes place (what little action there is) in one location, so it's quite boring.  Some of the acting is quite poor, and verbal exchanges weak.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My daughter loves this!!  Even though we bought it for her after she was already a good walker she still loves to push it around our house and play with the activities.  I can't wait to let our next child use it to help learn to walk.  It's a great toy!!
B0057ZEMF2|4.0|Very hip, modern and filled with innovation. The first cut stopped me in my tracks because i was expecting the album to sound like her CD Anoushka. After my initial shock, I found myself listening over and over again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the best book I have read...(and I have not read the second book yet) :) I love this so much. It has so much adventure... it  truly amazing.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is seriously one of the best games I have ever played. it is so amazing. even though it can be hard at some levels that is what makes it really really fun
B0042U94UQ|4.0|very cute and funny ...however, extremely short for the money...buyer beware...someone needs to do a full length video of just these guys
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Another great season, but how many disasters can one family endure? The season was a little much for me, but i still enjoyed it.
0062082353|5.0|R.I.P Chris Kyle. Who was shot, and killed on Saturday February 2nd, by a veteran he was trying to help with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br /><br />A tragic, and truly unfitting end to a great American.<br /><br />Heart, and prayers go out to his family, and loved ones.
B008B9JSD2|2.0|I was very disappointed in this dvd. I thought it would be much better than it was. It was not funny.
1433502410|5.0|I bought them for gifts when my Pastor told me that Life Application wasn't a literal translation from Hebrew and Greek. I don't want someone's opinion; I want a direct translation that is word for word.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best reality game ever!<br />I love it IT really brightens my mood seeing that beautiful horse every day because I play it 247!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Intuitive game that is easy enough to keep u playing but hard enough to make you think . . . Glad I found it
B008K3N68M|4.0|I had a problen with part of the dvd freezing in one spot. I had a hard time getting it to move on.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I've watched this thing so many times it's unbelievable and I still thoroughly enjoy the story line and special effects.<br />This is a new and unique approach to &#34;the Gods&#34; and our beginning...it shows man is still having visions and trying to figure out our origens based on something completely logical...I loved the tie in to the first Alien movie  and the huge creature they found seated as though ready to take off in his ship....genius...
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Some stranger than true stories are incredible and this is one.It gives the inside story of war by both sides.It shows that men of honor are not found only in our country.A great read.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Well written, however, I kept waiting to hear something suspenseful and that time never came.  I suppose it was good for the author that nothing bad really happened during her experience
B008B92U32|4.0|This is a fun ap to play with. It is a little tricky getting the face shapes just right. Definitely will create some laughs. Not sure if I would pay for the ap though. Mine was free.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I like Sam Worthington's acting...he's believable...the special effects were good...and the story is an old one revised...to really appreciate this DVD, go get a copy of the old version....
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is a great Harry Bosch story.As a fan of Connelly I found this is one of the best I have read and I have read most of his books.He has the knack of getting a believable and interesting plot line.Great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and I love horses it makes me feel like I have my own horse . and they are all so cute and fun to play with
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I was never a huge Maroon 5 fan, but I gotta say I love this album. Love the continuous dance feel of it.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|What a stupid name for a movie...right? HOWEVER....this is my favorite movie from 2012...the story is great...the acting is great...the special effects were great...the animation was great....now, let me ask you a question: how many people do you think never saw this movie because the name of the movie didn't in any way make them want to see the movie....????
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I loved it and couldn't put it down, it's a must read for all.  The story makes you look at your own life and how you should live it!
B003SI605K|5.0|On older but good movie.  Watched with my daughter,21, and we both enjoyed it.  It was suggested viewing by someone in her sociology class.
B004XISI4A|5.0|A song of ice and fire are the best books I've read in a long time, much better that the Lord of the rings or many other books in the same genre. I would recommend them to anyone. They are like other  fantasy books but seeped with a realism of plot and characters that seem like they are real people. Anything can happen! I can't wait for the next book to be published!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I'm loving these new computer generated stories...especially from this producer; they're always great, beautifully done and fun to watch....absolutely great little movie.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Still learning, but I like it. It's user friendly.  The hardest part is getting all 3 of my other calendars put into this one..
1607050072|3.0|Gave it a 3 stars as again I feel that it promised more than it delivered. It is beautifully marketed - perhaps a bit more content? or variety. Still what was in there was good.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the Harry Potter movies are stunning to watch! A great deal of work went into the effects which just gor better in each movie! Not recommended for small children but adults will be amazed at the quality of these movies.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Let me be right up front with you...I love anything Denzel Washington acts in...I think he's great. I mean a story is only as good as the casting...if an actor isn't believable, it ruins the story...this guys is always believable. I even liked &#34;Training Camp&#34;...I just don't want to watch it again....why&#34; ...I like Denzel playing the good guy...there are two people I would love to meet (no...they're not politicians...)....Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington...why? ...just so I can shake their hand and say, &#34;Really ...Really good job...I have thoroughly enjoyed your work&#34;....
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was such a good read that I'll probably read it again.I've already recommended it to several friends - just as another friend told me about it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As all the others, Season 3 has so far shown an age most of us will never see or feel. But I so love all the characters in it, and look forward to every<br />new episode. With love HC
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book until the end. I wonder if it is being set up for a sequel. Most others I spoke to had the same disappointment of the end that I had.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|I like Sam Worthington's acting...this is good ...good special affects (some better than others), but overall, you had to believe in Sam and I did...a good movie...to really appreciate it, go look at the earlier versions...
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie was funny and entertaining and the music was good. Had me laughing out loud. Tops on the list
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Best Yet!! The shows went by so fast  kept me wanting more, was sad when I ran out of CD's to watch  Cant wait for next season to come out. I never watch on TV I wait for the seasons to come out on DVD so I can watch all of them.Great show!!
B000GCFBQU|3.0|It took me a while to get into the book---thought it boring. However, as time went on, it became more interesting.
B004SBX112|5.0|It is my mission in life is to kill those dumb pigs. We are socked in with snow so I find myself playing Angry birds too much.
B00000JSJC|5.0|Strange Days is one of the movies you either really love or hate.  It's a classic 90's movie that centers on action and adventure with some sci-fi towards the supposed pre-apocolyptic millenia.  Much like the movie \\"End of Days\\" (1996).  Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) is an ex-cop turned self-absorbed \\"drug of the future\\" dealer.  He sells microdiscs that give the viewer a sense of perception, feelings, and all in all, you can basically live anyone elses life but yourselves when watching.  Lenny thengets thrown into a big conspiracy revolving around no other than the cops, a weird german blond girl, the bad guy from \\"The Crow\\", his ex-gf (Juliette Lewis), and a limo driver (Angela Bassett).  Angela Bassett and him become a team and together, bc they have to work on getting the disk to the right hands or risk ultimate death.  Life i said, it's a movie you either REALLY LOVE or REALLY HATE, you have to watch it, bc describing it in too many detail you wont get it.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Like most of the reviews here tell you, this movie is formulaic, yet entertaining enough if you're bored and in the mood for a frivolous comedy.  Rebel Wilson is the main comedic force in this, and between the jokes and the songs, I don't regret spending my time and money to rent it.  It's especially good as background noise, for those who want a film they can put on while working on other things.  Be warned, however - there is one running gag that may upset those who dislike grossout humor.  Viewers who want to watch Glee without actually watching Glee will be pleased, however.<br /><br />I'd say that the most problematic thing in this movie was the treatment of the romantic subplot.  The male lead is presented as &#34;deserving&#34; the main character simply because he decides to pursue her, despite her outward disinterest.  Then again, it IS a mindless college comedy, so you get what you sign up for.<br /><br />It's formulaic, with some solid laughs, a few unpleasant gags, and a good soundtrack.  If you're bored, this movie will help you to be slightly less bored.
B000Q7ZJ9Y|5.0|In a world where dubstep and progressive house are electronic standards, Justice pushes themselves away from the norm with this album. The album has a unique, big, and aggressively emotinal sound that is unique to the world of French electro, and I'd really recommend it for any one into electronic music.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a great pair.  The story line has many different facets and keeps your<br />interest as to what happens next
B001KR9AP8|5.0|The album deserves 5 stars*****<br />Still listening to these songs and other Beyonce songs instead of the newer artists who have come along. People should give Beyonce more credit for being a trendsetter.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game,with all the new obstacles it is whay much better than the first temple run,I finished that game but I will see how this goes.<br />!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love Downton Abbey! The streamed videos were of excellent quality with the exception of the fourth in the series. It stopped unexpectedly numerous times which made watching it very disconcerting. That is why I could not give a 5 star rating.  The rating reflects the quality of the streaming, not the program itself.
B00632HWOG|4.0|good app.  i have it on my android phone and felt the need to also put it on my kindle.  the app is much easier than using the web browser for the device.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|Ground Hog Day is a great movie and lots of of fun to watch. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again...
B002N5N5QQ|1.0|Terrible at least one in every season was not able to be watched very disappointed. Will never buy DVDs again.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, nice twist at the end! Was entertained through out the whole movie. Jennifer Lawrence was great as well!
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|I wanted a drive that I could connect to my router so that all of my other computers and devices could share the same files.  I bought this reading some of the other reviews that are more technical than mine and it was simple to hook up and install.  I am by no means an IT guy and I was able to have all of my computers and devices reading from the drive very quickly.  I would recommend this device.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I couldn't wait for Downton Abbey season 3 to arrive.  It came on the day promised!  However, I thought it was to be the UK unedited addition but instead it is the PBS version, complete with commercials. How dissappointing.  I have to fast forward through the Viking River Cruises and the Ralph Lauren commercials.  Not what I thought I ordered.  That said, Downton Abbey is all that I hoped it would be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game and right now it is world tour best game I've played even better then temple run 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool great even better if you added rope swings and roller skating wish it was my idea  amazing great cool fantastic best game ever in the world.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  At times, the love story can get a little sappy and unrealistic, but that's the point of the movie so it totally works.  I love to watch this as I'm falling asleep because its like a bed time story, the music is great, narration is great, acting/characters are great.  Ewan McGregor plays a character I would normally get sick and tired of, but because the movie is set as a fairy-tale type of story being told, not as an adaption of a book, it works perfectly, and instead I love the character and want to go on his adventures with him.<br /><br />Also, the older version of &#34;Dad&#34; (who I think is Albert Brooks) is a character you can't help but love.  He's an adulterating irresponsible compulsive liar, but you don't seem to care.<br /><br />Great movie to get carried away with.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|Received this the product fast. It seems like it is as good as the orginal equipment that came with the shaver
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's ok I guess I mean to me it's just one of the other rip game like temple run so its nothing special and it has no uniqueness to it
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This series keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat.  Can't wait for the 2nd season out on dvd
B008R65Y28|5.0|The set was in great shape, which was a relief.  Public Enemies is a great movie, Fear and Loathing was better than I remembered (or didn't remember, ha!), and I have yet to watch Cry Baby but am looking forward to critiquing it.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Huge moral to the story.  My daughter and her friends love it. Bold graphics and catchy lyrics.  Definitely a good movie
B004811PMO|5.0|I was completely satisfied with this purchase.  I added Oklahoma to my Amazon library and viewed it using a projector. I was completely satisfied with the quality and the process.
6303122647|5.0|Another one of my favorite movies, this is extremely creative with a great soundtrack.  A little scary at a part or two for really young kids, so I would recommend it more for pre-teens, teens, or adults.  But its just an awesome movie, and I especially like it because you can watch it from October all the way through til Christmas and be in the holiday mood!!  Since it is a mix between Halloween and Christmas :)
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These come in three different sizes and work exactly as planned. They are very easy to put onto the unit and very easy to remove. The product is perfect. You WILL need a replacement set if you use your Voyager with any frequency over a longer period of time, as that continued use, as expected, will wear the earpiece down at the junction where it fits onto the device.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's a great app but I was expecting it to let me pick the song I would wake up to which would be thrift shop but you can't but besides that it has everything you could ever want in a free alarm clock app.
6302787068|5.0|You can't go wrong, the music is great, the Genie is just a great character who is exemplified by Robin Williams, and it shows two sides to a story and how there's room for change.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Still going strong! Season 1 and 2 were captivating and season 3 doesn't dissappoint either.  Thank you for another great season!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Purchased LEGO Minecraft 21102 for my grandson for his birthday, and he was very happy.  Other kids at his birthday were &#34;jealous&#34; that he got it and told him how lucky he was.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|This movie is hilarious and fun for ages 1 to 91.  Seriously, the whole family can enjoy it.  There's adult humor, but its good clean fun so its not inappropriate for young kids.  The characters are just plain funny, and it reaches people on all sorts of levels.  One of the greatest cartoons ever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a really cool game.it gives you a chance to express your self when your building something.its really fun and there is an update that just came out. if you don't want to buy it just buy the demo
B009H442DG|3.0|Haven't really listened much to CD to give it a fair rating as I purchased it after Christmas and not in the mood to really listen to Christmas music at that time.  Will probably enjoy it much more at Christmas time next year.
B0000VD04M|5.0|While this isn't an exceptional movie, it is really interesting and well done.  This may be my favorite character Johnny Depp plays ever.  Kind of a mix between Hunter Thompson in Fear and Loathing and Edward Scissorhands.  It's very funny, but in that general kind of way, not slap stick or outrageous.  And its a unique subject matter, and is nostalgic of old movies and film making.  Also, Martin Landau's portrayl of Bela Lugosi is great, I don't know how true to life it is, but its a great character regardless.  Unique movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cool game. Learn allot about horses. If you like casual games this is definitely one to get. Very cool game.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I have played this CD over and over again several times.  Love the music.  Would highly recommend it, especially if you watch the series.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I love this movie!!!!  Love the music, love the concept, love the acting, love the directing, love everything.<br /><br />warning:dark and violent
B004RUF022|5.0|These performances of Bach's organ works are monumental. the phrasing, the registrations, the tempos are well thought out, lastly the organs used sound wonderful! jb
B000FCK65W|5.0|I enjoyed this classic much more as an adult, vs. the school assignment from years past, because the electronic version allowed me to define words that have since become obsolete (or at least &#34;old fashioned&#34;.)
B00684J49U|5.0|This was a Christmas gift that the Girls wanted and so far they have enjoyed it very much. Thanks you so much.
B0014JLYPQ|2.0|This is my second pair of bistro crocs and for some reason they have me slipping and sliding all over the wet floors at work. Very disappointed, I loved my last pair so much and now I'm afraid I need to start my search all over again for that perfect work shoe. =(
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such attention to detail is put into the making of this show, I feel almost a part of each of character's life and advocate for every one of them. The only critique I have is in the form of a question: Why was this season so short?! Season one had three discs, but two had six. I thought, if anything, three would be as long as two. But buy this show! If you like English drama that pays attention to historical detail in reference to time, technology, and social class where everything is on the verge of monumental change, then this show is for you! The writing is fantastic. Even when you are a part of the dramatic irony and are the witness to a trajedy at the hand of a villian, you find yourself in their corner as well (at least when they're a member of the house). I find it amazing the level of loyalty I feel for these characters. My feelings are so strong that I am truly disappointed when I find out anything about the actors in real life. That may seem silly, but Downton is such a world of its own, I hate to have any alternate &#34;reality&#34; spoil it. If you are able, I absolutely recommend watching Season 1-3 in quick succession (i.e. one per night) and avoid ALL sppoilers. I predict that you will find this show as riveting as I have, if you like anything of this genre. Enjoy!
B0017SWSCW|5.0|You can't go wrong with Archer, in fact I think I had read this novel before but I still couldn't put it down and read the whole thing again and still loved it he is a great story teller, I would give my right arm to have that kind of talent.....
1608862801|5.0|This was a gift for a child who is a fan of the show.  As of now, it has been read about 5 times, so I'm glad to promote reading.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the most incredible series ever! If you haven't seen season 1 & 2 get it now! You will LOVE it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun. I really love the change of venue( locations).  It can get a little blotchy on certain characters. Keep up the good work I compete with my grand saunter to see who can get high score. She is five and can hold her own.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a game where you take care of your own horse, train it, and enter it in competitions then get more horses.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|Three times I saw this film At the Pictures, in 1984: such lush and rich music, acting, and staging: Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas at the height of Romanticism.<br />I enjoyed Susan Graham and Domingo in Gluck's Iphegenie en Taurus, produced by the Metropolitan Opera, New York, if ever it becomes available.<br />Elizabeth.
B0059GVBHG|3.0|The condition and quality of the product were excellent. However, the film itself is incredibly disturbing. Sad to think that there are people this messed up in our world.
0345803493|5.0|Great book! I really enjoyed this deeper look into Christian Grey and his lifestyle! It is on my must read list!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game a lot it is a very fun game and I think u will love it to
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun and addictive.  Help is appropriate, so it doesn't become frustrating.  Will play more of these types of games.  Highly recommend.
0345803507|5.0|This was a great ending to a great trilogy! I wish there were more than three books! I never wanted to put it down!
B000P0J09W|4.0|I really enjoy this movie! My child has watched more than 5 times. I would definitely recommend. The Cyndi Lauper's song makes it worth watching.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is way better and more challenging than the first temple run. I can not stop playing it!!! please buy this app.
B0055SWM08|4.0|IT is a lot of fun...so far. The jury is out!  I may get tired of it.  I will just<br />have to see.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|I really enjoy this movie! My child has watched more than 5 times. I would definitely recommend. However, I don't understand why this is a Special Edition. There is nothing in special...
B000W93CHC|5.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth this sequal is equally as facinating. Putting history in a novel context makes one not willing to put it down--always waiting for the next chapter. Great writing but sometimes following the progress of all the characters gets confusing. All in all can't wait to finish it and go one to the next book(s). Thank you Ken Follett.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I really love the Downton Abbey miniseries, but I was a little bit disappointed in the editing  of the third season on dvd. I was rather surprised that there were some scenes cut in the last three episodes, compared to viewing them on TV. Also, part of the dvd was including the making of Downton Abbey which I was really looking forward to see. Instead of the making of season three, only the making of season one and season two were included in the \\"special features\\".<br />Everything else is fine. If you don't mind scenes that are cut out, compared to seeing them on TV, then enjoy the movie.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I brought this to keep at work to charge when i need to, it does not work with the Kindle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this at work and home! Clean, clear and simple to use. No way to go wrong<br />with this free app!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I ever read. It's in my top five favorites. I loved it. It was not to mushy but not dry at all. Simple and lovely.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We watched it 4 times in the 24 hour rental period !  The entire family loved this movie!  Highly reccomend
B009VB97EY|1.0|Not a good movie at all!! Language drug use not what I expected at all!! Channing Tatum disappoints and the ending sucks.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I think this game is really fun.  Bubble games are what is &#34;in&#34; now on facebook and other sites, so I thought this would be fun for the Kindle, and it is!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app tells you exactly how.long you have left based on what your doing. LOVE it! Now there is no guessing if I can finish my book.
0006547745|5.0|Superb job of research in the context of first hand exploration of route and sites described.  Dalrymple is rapidly becoming my favorite writer.  A lot of presumptions are examined and discarded, with a proper explanation, others are left between the lines, yet are no less valid, especially if seen against the background as portrayed.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I bought this for my husband to complete his set.  We watch Smallville when nothing else is on the satellite that we want to watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its pretty cool. I wish it was easier to get horses and to get gems. over all its pretty AWESOME!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|have had no issues with this board since purchase. running fx8150 cpu at 4 ghz(low clock ) i have  no issue.
B00632HWOG|4.0|With the Kindle, I use this when I can't get to the computer.  Its a wonderful app for the Kindle.
B009A87Z6U|1.0|I have two blue ray players that works fine. However the bluray disc wont' play on eighter machine.  The regular DVD plays fine on either machine. I just don't have time to deal with this and then get another that is no better. John W
B00B2H28SM|5.0|Just when I think I couldn't love these wonderfully talented ladies any more than I already do, they go and release a masterpiece like this! This is the first time in my life that I have listened to a new album and not only loved every single song on the album, but I am truly having a difficult time deciding which is my favorite song. It is one of those albums that you listen to it and feel like it was written for you. Very poppy and uber catchy. Perfectly represents the full range of emotion involved in love and relationships. Beyond their music, Tegan and Sara are wonderful role models, for LGBT youth especially. They deserve all the support in the world. If you aren't listening to this album you are really missing out ^_^
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What can be said about Angry Birds.  Its a game everyone loves, and its so addicting!!  Would recommend to anyone with kindle.
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|Good movie.  I like Joseph Gordon Levitt and who doesn't like Bruce Willis?  The story was good and the ending was a surprise but I was left feeling like there should have been more.  I purchased this movie but I'm thinking this one would be better as a rental.
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|I have awaited Emmy Rossum's new album so impatiently! This took me aback, because I wanted her to write her own songs, but her old fashioned songs really work well with her type of voice. It was a great buy, and it is a great album to listen to. Best songs to listen to are Pretty Paper, and These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You).
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I'm not one for horror books, but this one is really keeping my attention.  I don't read much at a time, but then sometimes I feel I can't put it down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the trilogy!!!! made my life much happier !! lol!! ;)  I just couldn't stop reading until I finished all 3 books!
B000YIGNKE|3.0|This version of the story pales when compared to the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version. The scenes at the end when Anne is running back and forth seem ludicrous to me. Also, the actor who portrays Captain Wentworth seems to be plucked out of a later century. Again, the Amanda Root version is much more to my liking.
B00005NWM3|4.0|My husband and I love to listen to music, but I bought this for him to listen to when he is playing his PS3 or his XBox360.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the trilogy!!!! made my life much happier !! lol!! ;)  I just couldn't stop reading until I finished all 3 books!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|The cast in this story does a credible job in pulling off this story.  I liked the casting except for the part of Mr. Thorpe. He did not at all match the beauty of his sister. However, I would have given this product five stars had it not been for the gratuitous sexual overtones in Miss Morland's dream scene and Captain Tilney's one-night stand with Miss Thorpe. These were not necessary and would have saved us the trouble of skipping over these parts each time we view the movie. Mr. Tilney, Miss Morland, Miss Tilney and General Tilney were all portrayed very well. The story is very well done and is entertaining.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you like solitaire, and play in on the computer, this one is just as fun.  Easy to move the cards and all!!!
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I saw the live television broadcast of this album by Andrea Bocelli on QVC.  They were offering this album for sale with a 6-song bonus CD.  I decided to wait about purchasing the album.  I had an Amazon credit for an MP3 product, and this was the first thing I saw when I was ready to purchase.  I have not downloaded it to my device yet, but I know that I am going to love it, as the performance on TV was remarkable.  Although I didn't receive the bonus CD, I am happy with this purchase.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My sub $100 tablet now has all my Kindle content as well now I have a spare copy of my content at work with many of the technical manuals I had to carry my personal device for previously.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|My husband listens to it while he plays his PS3 and/or XBox360.  Was good idea for me to get his favorite type of music.  I'm not the best shopper, so this was a wise purchase.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I ordered this for my 14 year old granddaughter for Christmas, and she was so excited to receive it.  She loves One Direction.  All I can say about this product is that she is happy and so I am happy.  Happy with this purchase.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|As someone who loves to run, I am thankful to have read this book. It was informative and provided great insights into running as a way of life. I am sorry that it is over because it was so fun to read. This book was the perfect combination of science and story!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I absolutely love eBay and this app is great! It works just as well as if I was using a computer to search on ebay
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|My daughter in law suggested this book, as I teach in an elementary school. I found the book very interesting. It is based on clinical studies. I ordered it to read on my iPad, I would have  preferred  the hard copy.  I like to make notes and reference pages. An interesting read for not only teachers, school psychologists, but also parents wanting their child to succeed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this great read. Nicely done for Kindle.<br />A wonderful escape. Well written, intriguing. A page turner. I cannot wait to read the other two books.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I've always wanted to learn to play piano and this app helps make that happen. I totally recommend,Two thumbs up!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a fun game but I don't like how the characters are dressed. The girl tricky has her underwear showing. But everything else is awesome!!! It is just entertaining.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|Not for children but if you loved the book you'll likely want to see the film too. That's why I chose it. I did love seeing all the characters actually 'age' in real life. I just love Ron Weasley.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love browsing on pinterest. The app works great and let's me look up great little diy things real quick. Two thumbs up
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season will lift your spirits, fill you with hope, and then break your heart. I'm waiting with baited breath for the next season, it's definite must watch.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I love the game but some times it freezes on my kindle fire. other than that its a fun game and will help u kill some time.
B0095D4I8S|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. Great cast. Great story. Greater ending! A must see! If you haven't seen this movie yet you have only yourself to blame :-)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app so much that I will never delete it in a million years... I love you White Noise!
B00AOOIIVA|3.0|Boring.  Story not good enough to hold out without more laughs.  Expected more from Tim Burton.  Watch Hotel Transylvania instead-now that's a funny movie!
030758836X|4.0|I am an avid reader but for some reason I am usually not drawn to mysteries.  In fact, I bought the book based on all the hype it has received even when I heard it was a mystery.  Having read the book, I don't really see it as a mystery at all.  Certainly there was some unexpected twists and turns in the story, but it was more of a psychological study of two people married to each other and yet worlds apart on so many levels.  If that sounds dull, it isn't.  I found myself fascinated by the characters, and I can say with assurance that I don't think the book would disappoint. I would recommend this to anybody.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has everything you need to make sure your device is in good shape! I will refer this app to everyone I know!
0345803485|5.0|If you want to read something new, interesting, erotic, and mind blowing then I would suggest buying the trilogy of Fifty Shades of Grey.  Once you read the first book you will definitely want to read the other books in the series.  Also purchase it from this site because they offer the best deal and I received them in less than a week.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|OMG is all I have to say the passion these two have for each other is crazy! Gideon and Eva keep the reader drawn  in. The only thing I did not like abut this book is that there is still so much unknown about Gideon!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is infectious!  Once you start playing this, you won't stop!  Just make sure you don't get frustrated, take your time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This  is a different style  of book than I usually read. However it was good and kept me coming back for more. I am to curious and am now on to the second book to find out more about Mr. Grey.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Love at first sight t great but the twist this story throws at you right away is horrible because both characters know they can not act of the desire for each other.  You can't help but fall in love wit Will!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|There were a couple slow spots, but overall a very enjoyable story. Nice twist about the island being literally alive and breathing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak was an excellent story and a quick read. Very emotional. I would definitely recommend this book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book interested me within e first few sentences. Travis is that bad boy who every thinks is no good but once the reader gets to know Travis you can not help but love him. The female character did upset me most of the book because she questioned everything! I can not wait until the next book comes out!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My family enjoys this version of Temple Run as well or better than the first.  It's a fun game for all ages!
B004LWZW8S|5.0|Theseus looks for the Epyrus Bow and faces King Hyperion, who seeks to use the same bow in order to free the Titans...<br /><br />Henry Cavill shines as Theseus.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After first I was mad at myself for buy this book because it is about high school students but once I got started I could not put it down. This book took the reader on a journey of emotions. I could not believe how this book flowed from start to finish!
B000MGATTE|4.0|I'm not completely finished yet but, it is good so far. I am not even to the halfway point yet though.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks fans will not be disappointed. Very good, quick read. Really enjoyed the love story. Recommend to all to read
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved 50 Shades but this book was crazy! The passion and fighting start right away. Gideon is a great character. Eva has a strong personality which is nice be because she is not shy about her sexuality like Ana Steele. I finished this book in one day!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would recomend this book to any body who likes stephen king. This book is EXTREMELY good. Not action packed but....
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Spoil alert. This book is about a child who kills for no reason. Once you come to that realization the book is wholly depressing.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|And that's why I love it! It's funny, it's great acting, totally worth $5.00! I watch it whenever it's on tv, figured I would buy it so I can watch it whenever!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever ! I would buy million phones and get this app.It's the best game I swear. You got to get this app ! : )
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game was a little more challenging for the grandkids to play, and navigate through.  They still enjoy trying to figure it out.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Movie viewed with no problems or interruptions.  Film quality great.  A lot of great actresses and actors in this film.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Watched the movie first, liked ending of movie better but book is good. Definitely a story of love, family and mental anguish life can bring
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded this game because this is one that even a 3 year old can master.  When sitting in an airport waiting for a flight this is on of those games that can make the time go by more quickly.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Months later, I am still thinking about this book. While Defending Jacob was easy to read, it is difficult to get it out of my mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely am in love with this game!I've never been bored of it, I could play it for days! Absolutely recommend it. Install now!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Joss Whedon is a genius- this show despite it's length is my favorite show of all time- I highly recomend it.
0979019710|5.0|I'm not a \\"reader\\" but I was ready for my life to get better...not only did I \\"want\\" it to get better, but I NEEDED it to get better! Chapter 5 has 5 steps to being a \\"Snooze-Free\\" person and I actually DID them this morning, as I just read that chapter yesterday.... it actually WORKED!!! My 15 yr old son, Brendan (which is as bad as me about sleeping in -cuz I made him that way by \\"my\\" example) set his alarm clock for 6 (cuz we read it \\"together\\") and I set mine for 6:30. I woke up...walked over to the other side of the room to turn my alarm off, then on my way to the kitchen to get my water, I ran into Brendan.... FULLY DRESSED with his backpack on!!!! Woohoo!!!!!! I think he shall be my accountability partner! So proud of him...and myself ;) hehe!!! He said, I already brushed my teeth, here's my water and I'm off to school. YEEHAW <3 I just got chills! Awesome stuff Hal and THANK YOU!!! I haven't been able to put this book down since I got it and I am looking forward to the 30 day challenge!!!! I'm only half-way through the book and my life has already changed for the BETTER!!!!!!!<br /><3 Candice and family
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is pretty awesome. The missions keep me busy and addicted ! Something fun to do when on the go or at home without you husband :p
B001KOFH2G|5.0|This is my favorite movie. If you've seen Firefly you need to see this. If you haven't seen firefly- go watch it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the new game but have some of the same complaints others have posted: can't see over the monster, the game isn't always smooth and the coins can be hard to see against the yellow background.  Very addicting though.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Cheeky and fun, this show had me giggling and belly laughing throughout. Cute and wholesome,  with a good dose of adult humor mixed in.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is so awesome. I haven't found a better app love it. Even my little sister loves it. It is amazing
1469984202|5.0|As a result of finishing Wool, I will be reading more from this author.I think this narrative illustrates how our scalars for time are really arbitrary, and that societies change at different rates under different pressures. Hugh Howey creates relatable characters that demand your affection or disdain. Good writing!
B00422LESO|1.0|This book could have been really cute, but the author Darcy, et al. to new lows; it was silly and disappointing.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My wife loved it. The story line and scenes show English aristrocracy as they were then and very little has changed.
B003QTWR08|4.0|Kids loved it, though they have seen it before.  Streaming was perfect and didnt have a single dropout or buffer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game! You always have a goal to get and it is so addicting! I have it connected so I am able to see how my friends are doing and brag when I get a higher score then them. I'd right more but watching the super bowl go Brooklyn!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was so much fun to play. Always kept me wanting to play. I recommend it to anyone that likes hidden object games with a mystery to boot.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Was very different from what I have read.  Kept me wanting more.  I will read more of his books on this site.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I enjoyed reading these books.  The plots are intricate.  Character development is excellent.  The climax and end are satisfying.  These are great detective novels.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Although it's the 16th in the series, The Affair takes us back to the beginning when Jack Reacher enters into a voluntary separation from the army, and becomes the vagabond vigilante that we are familiar with.<br /><br />A woman in Mississippi has had her throat viciously slashed and despite the lack of evidence, it is believed that this could have been a crime committed by someone at the Kelham military base. Reacher is sent undercover to try and glean information from the local population while his peer is sent into Kelham to investigate within the military base. When Reacher discovers that there were 2 other women in Carter Crossing murdered with the same MO, and when a couple of men are killed with what appears to be military issued weapons, the suspicion that someone in the military was involved grows stronger although evidence to the identity of the killer or killers remain elusive.<br /><br />Reacher uncovers a conspiracy within the Pentagon and certain political figures, and finds himself having to consider if the truth is more important than the institution.<br /><br />This was definitely an improvement over some of his earlier books in the series when I was starting to get tired of his usual formula of having Reacher fight small town power moguls.
B008518MOW|4.0|This was a very good 3D Blu-Ray movie, but I think some of the action could have been better. The best 3D effects were in the weapons gallery in the special effects menu.
0553579908|5.0|I'm enjoying the books. I watched the series on HBO, amazed at how closely it follows the books.  An enjoyable read.
B006671NPM|4.0|This is a Very Good 3D movie, but not quite as good as Avatar!  The action does come out at you more and in a place or two the embers do seem to float out of the screen. It is a close second to Avatar in my opinion.
1616550414|5.0|This is book is one of the best books that has ever been made. It is a must for a Zelda fan, and for anyone who has played zelda in general. The book itself is beautiful, and the descriptions are right on and give you amazing details about different Zelda games. Art is fabulous and could help your drawing skills.<br /><br />Kids Review
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar was the first 3D movie that we saw in a theater and I think it is the best 3D movie that I've seen in the theater and on 3D Blu-ray. The action is great and the seed (spirit) pods from the tree of life seem like they are falling around you. It is the greatest 3D movie I have seen.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great stories, and I'm always hanging on Maggie Smith's words -- she gets the best lines!  Sunday nights are the best.
B008UZ7MUI|4.0|As with other movies I've seen converted to 3D, it is just not as good as one made for 3D. The scenes did show some depth, but the action parts that should come out of the screen at you didn't as much as they should.<br />Made for 3D movies are much better.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This movie was good I didn't think so at first from the title. It was funny, warm, different but good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has me hooked like a dog on a leash. Especially the new Rio version. The buses look totally cool. Plus carmen is so awesome! Anyone in their right mind can see that this game is pure awesomness.
B005RUUUAI|2.0|I guess i read it wrong and the husband was unhappy i didnt buy him the dvds. Love the show just hated having problems streaming!
B00ABO573A|5.0|Actors made me believe their actions were totally real.  Very moving and emotional story line/s.  May have to make the film a part of my  video library!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband started watching this year but I watched an episode and did not have a clue as to what was going on nor whom the characters were......luckily, our new Kindle Fire HD had the first two seasons and we watched  3 each night.  So very cool to hook up the Kindle Fire and stream them  through the television.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Extremely interesting. I loved every second of it. I can not wait to read the next one. I love this book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun. Had an awesome time playing this. All of the missions kept it interesting even after you've. Played for a while
B0063IH60K|4.0|I cant stop playing it over and over, it's fun and addicting. Definitely recommend this app! Get it now and start playing.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Slight spoilers, but they might save you some disapointment!!!!<br /><br />Comments and Concerns:<br />1. The talents of Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce were underutilized.<br />2. The scientist on the mission displayed some extremely unprofessional behavior that proved to have fatal<br />  consequences. For example, getting lost in tunnels that were already scouted by drones and assuming that<br />  some alien creature, that resembled a King Cobra and not some fuzzy Koala Bear, was not a threat. Come on<br />  man!<br />3. Why would they take off their protective helmets in some completely unknown environment?<br />4. If something extremely tall, heavy, and narrow is falling over you, only Wile E. Coyote would be stupid enough not<br />  run to the side so that imminent doom could be avoided.<br />5. Ok, the kamikaze scene was not well written. What are they chances that 3 out of 4 would be so ready for such<br />  a  heroic finish.  I could understand the captain going down with the ship but anyone else gets a get of jail free<br />  card - so to speak.<br />6. How did the bodyless android fly the alien ship without a body?<br />7.  THE GOOD: Cinematography, Artistic design and imagination, and the musical score created a watchable flick.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Actually enjoy the game, but I'm so sick of being taken off to different websites! Ad's I can take... but closing down my game? And locking up my tablet? Not acceptable&hellip;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a brain exerciser!!!  It is easy to understand and very addictive.  It is one of my favorite games.
B000002H48|5.0|Excellent double cd for die hard fans of the No Nukes bands especially CSN.  Highly recommend this to all.  I have the original album and its great to have the concert again.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|There aren't many quality racing movies, but this one is the exception.  They shot the movie very realistically for the era.  The extras alone, including the making of the movie, is worth the purchase alone.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Altho I love mahjong on the kindle I found certain tiles to be difficult to match, namely the green branch tiles with the tiny symbols on the top.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I relax every night by playing 4 suit spider solitaire. When I first started playing I could not win.  It took me 3 months before I won my first game.  I win several times a week now.  So, for those who are just starting out, it can be won.  Keep at it.
B00B3Q80ZW|5.0|This is an amazing show. I never knew, until getting the Kindle, that it was even out there. I love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a great all around game. just hats it when it lags. I recommend this for younger kids unless you're a huge horse lover.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is extra cool! The first one is great too but umm...this one is AWESOME !!! And the graphics can be confusing but u get used to it and it's epic.
B00005ASOC|4.0|This movie was a sleeper and a must see for Connery fans. Great movie to watch with the older kids and family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game gives you the real effect of having your own horse. I enjoy it very much, since I don't live on a farm.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I bought this game thinking it would be just okay but it has better than I expected. I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. The animation is funny and the characters are creative and fun. I also like the different holiday themes that they create. Look out temple run, all of the USA is loving subway surfer!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking dead has been a captivating show since the first episode of season one.  Season three seems to be the best season yet!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great way to kill time. I play it to take care of the adorable horse! I recommend this for all ages
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book, it was very interesting, keep me wondering what was going to happen next what kind of twist would play out in the next or next book for that matter.
B003VEGOZW|5.0|My brother showed me a video of the song &#34;Electric Worry&#34; and now I can't stop listening to it.  The BBC recording of it is even better in my opinion.  If you like Clutch, this is a great album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game my grandchildren love so much... they can't stop playing it!!!!! Even I have fun with Subway Surf. You try and get money. It is sort of like Temple Run 1 and 2. I love this game and I hope others do too.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|I found this band by playing Borderlands 2 on PC.  The intro video of Borderlands uses the song &#34;Short Change Hero&#34;.  After watching the intro video over and over on YouTube, I took the plunge and bought the album.  There are a lot of other great songs on here in a similar vein.  &#34;How you like me now&#34; is another song I was familiar with from before and really enjoy.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Just when you think you've heard everything from Tony Bennett, out comes this CD and DVD.<br />I enjoyed the DVD more than the CD as you can see the filming of the CD recording by the various stars.<br />Wonderful show and wonderful music!
B009O07NDY|3.0|I ordered two sets. The set I ordered for a gift was fortunately okay. I just got around to checking mine and it won't even play disc one because it so deeply scratched. Disc two is scratched as well. I'm going to order another set because I love the music, but beware and check what you get right away. It was very disappointing to get something like that. No quality control at all I guess. Too late to return it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a must have app for all horse lover's of any age. realistic sounds and graphics. great way to pass time.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I buy MP3s from amazon I can download them to all my gadgets.  Easy to use.  Best with true high speed internet.  Nowadays if it's barely faster than dial-up they promote it as high speed
B00B2V66VS|3.0|At first it was working beautifully!!!! the game itself is WAYYYY better than the first but after a while it started freezing quite often and it even shuts down on me if I ever get over 2 million!! doesn't even save my score!!  please fix this!!!
0670024813|1.0|The book presents a very misleading and untrue image of indigenous peoples and is harmful. Very controversial and definitely bias.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I like every book I have read in this series. Worth every penny spent. If you like otherworldly books, this is for you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was full of surprises! I enjoyed the romance piece within the story line along with the friendships that are carried out. I would reccomend this book to anyone!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|If you are looking for an exciting new world and get out of your world, this is your release. I read a lot and this book is very unique
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love it!  Can't stop playing it! It is definitely addicting, relaxing and enjoyable!  And the fact that it has four different games to play is a plus.
0345803485|5.0|I got the book within 3 working days. I really couldn't wait to read it seeing that everyone was talking about this book. The book held my attention. I didn't want to put it down. I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I will recommend it to any and everyone!!! Great Book!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|because you're probably addicted already!!! this game is all kinds of fun n it is compared to temple run all the time, but tbh i think this is better<br /><br />btw if you got my title reference, ily
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. It really gives you a new view of life.
B004S9AK7C|5.0|I now consider Ken Follett to be one of my favourite authors. He writes at a cracking pace,with a great sense of humour and just a little bit of tittilation.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I liked the first Dark Knight better, but the new tech was pretty cool in comparison to the other videos.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome better than temple run 2 it is awesome I recommend it if u like temple run I love it my favorite game ever score!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is a great app for kids who can't afford as real one it is even for b big kids to
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's not bad. This book is great for a teenager. A little ridiculous at times, but overall good.<br /><br />I would recommend it.
B008602KQI|3.0|I chose an okay rating for this movie because I read the book.  Perhaps, had I not read the book and seen the movie I would have liked it better?  The thing about the book was the frightening urgency of some of the situations the tributes found themselves in,  and the compelling empathy it evoked in me for the characters.  The movie didn't scratch the surface to develop that connection at all. I did, however,  like the eye into the gamemaker's studio and the interference his panel of technicians  could inflict upon the tributes in the arena... well done.  The portrayal of the capitol district people was splendid with their extravagant  and bodacious costumery(is that really a word?) and pageantry.  In the end, these two things are what elevated my rating to okay. I felt as dispassionate for the children in the arena as the capitol district viewers in the movie.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Definitely better than trying to cut bottles with the cotton string stuff but still much harder than it may seem. Be prepared to go through many bottles to get it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The ending was great...blew me away.  I just never expected it.  Safe Haven is definitely on my movie list or DVD
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I've waited for a very long time to see this...worth every second. This will be playing on repeat in my house for a very long time.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Gary Chapman has always been very intuative when it comes to bridging the communication gap between men and woman. His research and its findings are dead on as always. I only wish that more people would know to read his books or attend on of his seminars. Our countries divorce rate would drop significantly. Five stars for amazon for making this well written book available.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I love this game! It is fun and great for killing time. It reminds me of a simple Mario brothers game.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|All I got was 1 ugly photo of myself.guess it has to be out of the case & don't know how to get it out. Just too old for this.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Although I read this book in its entirety, I have to say if I had it to go over again, I would not.<br />The story really slowed down to almost boring at times.  In my opinion it was just another long book. It is definitely over priced for the \\"entertainment\\" value.
B0009X75UG|5.0|I've been in Love with Andreas Vollenweider since the 80's and that love for his talent has grown over the years, this man takes you on a journey of the senses and allows your mind, body, and soul to reconnect and sore.<br /><br />He uses earth air and sea to take you away to any ware you imagine you would rather be, listen and be swept away.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Recently Addicted to Downton Abbey and it was a fantastic way to get up to speed.  Thoroughly enjoyable and a great buy
B000FC2FVA|5.0|Phoenix has always been great, even if United was a little uneven but had some serious gems and Alphabetical was unfocused, this album has no filler, it's all fantastic pop-rock jams with a twist as their American influences drive the fun songwriting of this French group. If you've only heard their latest work you are missing out on a fantastic album.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Busy without being boring and there is always a quest affordable to do...I could waste a lot if time with this!
B003XKPPOU|2.0|I LOVE this movie. LOVE.<br />That said-- I was pretty excited to get a digital copy of this so I could watch it wherever, but it won't load.<br />Is it expired? Already used? Don't know as the screen where the activation code goes is blank.<br />Sigh.
0345803485|5.0|Ok my first book it is not a dirty novel like most people thinks,i love reading this im almost done so soon ill be on to the next one
B00571F26Y|5.0|If the big tobacco companies had labs to make their product more addictive then you know big food companies have labs to make food more addictive and us fatter.  Why, fat people eat more and they sell more.<br />Read the book, you will be glad you did.
0765316994|2.0|The book had some clever ideas but it never really grabbed me so I couldn't put it down. It is certainly not as good as any of the &#34;old mans war&#34; series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great book- you never know where the writer is going to take the storyline- keeps you guessing. The writer gets the reader involved instantly and keeps you reading!
1451638450|5.0|This makes a change portraying &#34;that idiot Ivan&#34; as a nice solid character in his own right. Miles hardly makes an appearance in this story but many of the other characters turn up, particularly Alyss and Ilyan. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it make a good addition to the Bujold collection.
B008MM9630|5.0|Fun, easy and addicting. I love it. But some of the quests make you pay coins (not real ones)  or gems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am officially addicted. Love love love rio. I went from playing once in a while to playing daily. It makes me push myself to get more coin
B008B9JSKU|4.0|Found this movie to be above average for plot and sound effects, was thoroughly blown away with movie plot ending.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Had to make some pretty ugly bridges to move onto the next level at times. Not sure how often I will play it but had some time to waste today so I gave it a look.
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|Liked the realism of film, sound effects were above average on blu-ray. Plot was very good thoroughly enjoyed movie from beginning to end..
B004YXX88A|5.0|Avantasia is one of my favorite bands right now, and since they will probably never play in the US, this is the closest I will ever get to seeing them live.  My only real complaint was no Michael Kiske, but thats no real biggie, because the rest of the DVD was fantastic.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I was thoroughly pleased with this collection and am please to add them to my personal movie collection. I have been amazed with the quality of Blu-ray to the DVD standard.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Fun and entertaining.  The birds in space is a good time for all ages.  Would recommend to anyone, although the kids can beat the levels faster than me
B001YV506S|5.0|The sound effects and picture quality of this movie were exceptional in comparison to the regular DVD version. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end and recommend to others.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|Very good depiction of Patton and George C. does a fantastic job.  According to my dad nails the character.  One to keep in the video collection.  Never get tired of it.
B003G4W49C|2.0|Seems legit<br />It was a good book to read I even would read it without reading it in English class<br />I am probably going to read the rest of the series
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Love it and would encourage others to rent or own.  Have meet some of the airmen before at an airshow and they are a proud bunch of guys as we should be proud of them too.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|The biggest bonus of purchasing this version of the movie was that it contained the regular DVD, plus the BluRay DVD, plus you can download a digital copy. This boxed set was priced the same as the DVD version. It's cool to have 3 ways to watch the movie. We have a regular DVD player, my sister has BluRay, and we can watch the downloadable version on the computer.
B004J64QR4|5.0|If you a  lover of the Les Miz then you have to own this.  Great show plus they bring back the original cast at the end.  Alfie Boe has a really bellowing voice with lots of heart an passion.  Nothing can beat the stage presentation of this show.  Buy it, you will watch it over and over
1469220660|5.0|After reading 50 Shades of Grey, I wanted to find another book just as great as the love story between Anastasia and Christian.  A lot of readers recommended this book -  which I believe is far better than 50 Shades.  This book doesn't have the whole 'bondage/S&M&#34; theme but it has a BETTER love story between the two star characters!  I am so in love with this story, it's not repetitive - the sex scenes are GREAT - the story line is wondering with good twists and turns and I am pissed I have to wait until May for the 3rd book of this Trilogy!!!!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Wifes older macbook pro's power supply is now being used with her new macbook air, so she has 2 power supplies now. Works great.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Saw the movie with my sister who just loved the music.  We have the Broadway version but it was nice to capture the movie's music
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I still can't watch anything &#34;beta&#34; without a flash player installed. HOW,does this thing work anyway. No I am not stupid, Just haven't figured it out yet!  Recommend only after I can get it working.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|The DVD arrived days earlier than expected. It is in perfect condition and exactly what I ordered.  The online description was absolutely perfect.  I wouldn't hesitate to order again.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Loved the style of writing that let me feel like I was reading letters from the main character.  Less cumbersome than traditional writing.  I was at once on the edge of my seat waiting for the bomb to drop, a little weary of the humdrum random chatter, and laughing out loud.  I was anxious to find out what exactly ailed the main character.  Brilliant.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It took me quite a while to read this book. I thought if I had to read Ana saying how hot Christian was one more time, I might stop reading this series all together. This one was written a lot better so I guess that's a plus.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Daniel Pink does his research and debunks the myths about the profession of sales.  While it isn't a new idea that &#34;we are all in sales&#34;, Pink puts an exceptionally insightful touch on the real A-B-C's of sales, not the cliche look made popular by movies like Glen Garry Glen Ross.
0143120530|4.0|The book and the service was everything I was expecting, and I would recommend the service it to anyone interested in a book.
B007P06DJ0|5.0|paul's best album in my opinion. Its a Classic, if you haven't heard it yet buy it in any medium and listen.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|What's not to like!  He is a fantastic singer and this album is truly great.  I need to order his newest album because it is probably even more so!  Worth every penny and then some!
B005R32L66|5.0|I bought an android tablet to see if it could replace my cellphone in the future and I'm glad I downloaded Skype. It connects in an instant, the sound quality is excellent and I'm excited to try the video feed.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It works fine, though the widget doesn't update itself. Instead, it shows tweets from whenever you last touched the widget to open the app, rendering the widget itself nothing but a screen-hogging icon wannabe. I've had no problems with the app itself, but I rarely use twitter on any platform.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|All I can say is that OMG!!!! i've never really been a Beiber fan BUT NOW he has won my heart... This album is AMAZING and he sound AWESOME on it!!! GET IT, you won't be disappointed!!
0385537816|4.0|I purchased this trilogy for my wife.  The hardcover trilogy currently cost $50.94 (I purchased it when it was less expensive, making purchasing the trilogy [as opposed to the individual books] more cost effective).  Each of the three hardcover books currently cost $15.85, for a total \\"trilogy\\" price of $47.55 (before S/H).  It is thus cheaper to purchase all three hardcover books as individual items in the same order (to keep the shipping free).  I would have understood the extra cost if the trilogy came as a boxed set, but unlike the paperback books, the hardcover books come shrinkwrapped with no box.  To be fair, it is not advertised as a boxed set, but as these books sit on my wife's nightstand beside the attractive boxed set of 'The Hunger Games' (hardcover), it makes this trilogy look very 'cheap.'  A very poor decision in my opinion to cut costs here.  'The Hunger Games' trilogy is a major contemporary of the Fifty Shades trilogy, and in this respect, far outperforms the Fifty Shades hardcover trilogy.  My order also arrived a day late and, although I am signed up for delivery 'exceptions' via text message, I never received notice that my wife would not be receiving the hardcover trilogy as she expected on its release date. Overall, I'm not impressed with the publisher's decision on package presentation, Amazon's pricing of the hardcover trilogy, or Amazon's late delivery.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a fast paced suspense filled novel with lots of twists and turns. It is hard to put down and I highly recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing!!!! This is one of the best books I have read , an amazing love story that rips at the heart!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I thought this was a good premise for a story, but reading from a 5 yr olds point of view got old - fast. If you have kids, maybe it wont get on your nerves as much, but between the baby talk and the constant in-your-face breastfeeding it was  tedious to get through. I stuck with it since it came highly recommended from a coworker. Like I said - Good premise, but would rather read it from the mom's point of view.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It's not as easy to reply or forward as I would have hoped, but e-mail on the phone is more complicated than it could be.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I saw a lot of bad reviews for this book, as people thought Mia was so mean to Adam. I think people maybe forgot what a horrible experience Mia had. Not only did her family die, but she was present for everything that happened. Of course she will be traumatized and have a little resentment towards him, since if it wasnt for him, she never would have stayed. i thought the story was pretty realistic - maybe that's what bothered people? Some people like fairy tales. I prefer real life. Also a lot of people felt that since both Mia and Adam were so successful at such a young age that it was very unrealistic. i looked at that as just a plot device, something to show you that although they both accomplished their dreams, they were still unhappy and felt alone in the world, because they didnt have each other. I think this author is very talented. Anytime i cant put a book down until i am done i consider it to be a 5-star book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I feel as though I learned a lot of history about the Germans and Russians during World War 2 as to how they interacted with each other especially after the war. It was well written and I enjoyed the continuation of the different family groups from the first book of the trilogy
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This directly dropped my temps by almost 5c on the same setup.  I had used the oem paste from my 212 evo, which is good for what it is.  This just performed better.
B0012KOCN8|1.0|I hate it because I can not see it. Will not play on any of our 3 TV's<br />We have HD 1080 with Blue Ray. Paid $42.48.<br />Would like to exchange for a compatible one. Unfortunately did not keep the box and return slip.<br />Advise procedure.<br />Gloria Nasser<br />gloria.n@travelstore.com
B009GX69RK|5.0|Makes me laugh out loud every show ! in love with Nick! fancy man 1&2 are my favorites! Thank You!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Though I prefer the Harry Potter book and was a little disappointed.  But I would recommend it for light reading.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you're a fan of good music at all, WATCH THIS! I could not believe what a large percentage of musicians I consider to be giants in my world are in this movie. And the number of incredible albums through the years that have been recorded at Sound City.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for at a great price.  Much nicer than my last one.  Color is nice too
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great way to kill time. my daughter loves horses and absolutely loves this game<br />I would recommend this app.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|You will never look at food the same again after you watch this documentary.  It is very informative and it motivates you to eat better, and realize that the FDA and the USDA do not have nearly as much power as you think.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Very funny movie!!!! I would watch it again and again!!! If you enjoy family guy, you will enjoy this! Two thumbs up!!!
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|Fantastic visuals and gameplay, but it does not run well on kindle fire hd, and the controls need bigger push areas, and the jumping does not mesh well with the left to right motion. Cute and fun but essentially unplayable.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|But i still enjoyed it.  Two great charactor actors. A little slow maybe, but enjoyable. Easy to watch while knitting.
1439102813|5.0|Alice Howland is a happily married 50 year old woman with three grown children and a successful academic career.  Alice lectures at Harvard and juggles a busy schedule, but then she starts to experience memory loss.  Alice hopes that her memory loss is simply a consequence of stress, of menopause, of growing older.  But one day, after she gets lost while out on her regular run, she decides to seek medical advice.<br /><br />Alice is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's dementia, and this novel follows her experience as she struggles to try to maintain her independence.  Her devastated husband, John, searches for a miracle cure.  Alice herself struggles to complete things that once came easily, to remember places and people, and to find a place in a world which is rapidly becoming unfamiliar to her.  `Still Alice' is her story.<br /><br />`I'm losing my yesterdays.'<br /><br />I've had this novel on my shelf since it was first published.  Not long after, a favourite relative was diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia, and I couldn't bear to read fiction about it.  The novel got pushed to the back of the shelf, and I picked it up by chance last week.  I wish I'd read it earlier.  Alice's story is compellingly written, and it's easy to mark her decline as she struggles to answer the questions she'd written for herself.  The questions she'd written to try to assess whether life was still worth living.  Alas, the reasoning behind what seemed to be a rational choice becomes lost as Alice's condition deteriorates.  As we see the world through Alice's eyes, we can sense what a lonely, disconnected place it becomes - but not entirely without humour.<br /><br />Lisa Genova, the author, has a Ph.D in neuroscience from Harvard University.  This was her first novel.  I think that `Still Alice' is a great step forward in raising awareness of Alzheimer's dementia: a disorder that I'd much rather read about than experience firsthand.  Early onset Alzheimer's dementia seems particularly cruel.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithrly cruel.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B004E547D8|5.0|This was a great movie, very funny.  Good cast.  Received movie very quickly from Amazon.  We like keeping good movies around for watching in our RV.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|AWESOME AND HORSE RACING TEAM game of this game was a new comment on this game of my HORSE RACING in this game is really cool
1616550414|5.0|This is a must buy for any Legend of Zelda fan. This book showcases the thought and effort put into every entry into the franchise. This chronicles the past 25 years of Zelda with art an nifty footnotes in the creative process. I cannot recomend enough!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fantastic reading I loved it immensely. From Book One, Two, and Three what a thrill of a ride with all the characters.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Amazing movie, suspenseful! I recommend this to any Bond fan HANDS DOWN!!! A MUST-SEE film in order to full understand the new Skyfall film
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Would recommend for a mature audience since the book is about killing for sport. Very good read, couldn't put the book down.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I absolutely love this album. This is one of my favorites by MCR and I have been looking for a physical copy for a long time and now I found one that wasn't like, $50. so yeah, great album, great band, great music, great everything. Absolutely recommend! :D
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This product is something I use in my computers and didn't think twice before I loaded it onto my tablet. I don't know exactly what I would be missing if I didn't have it because I downloaded it right away.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This is an intriguing story.  I wish it didn't remind me so much of &#34;Beauty's Punishment by A. N. Roquelaure (Ann Rice).

B007THA4FI|3.0|I felt while reading this that Rowling wrote it to be the opposite of Harry Potter. And she did that well. It was we'll written and the end really saved it and pulled me in. Otherwise I don't really choose to read books like this, life is too much like this. Too sad. Too much full of unfulfilled hopes.<br /><br />Rowling though is an excellent writer. Great use of vocabulary and slang. Great mirrored story line linear production.

B001CIPU3G|4.0|For their fourth record, 2008's \\"Shogun,\\" Florida's Trivium continues down the same path that they first started to take on their third, 2006's \\"The Crusade.\\" This means it is a modern thrash album. It might retain some of the band's early influences, as it does have some melodic metalcore and hardcore accents; but the main source of inspiration, here, is thrash and speed metal from the 1980's. Therefore, Matt Heafy leads the charge, trading-off between dirty, phlegm-flecked metalcore vocals and James Hetfield-ian crooning, while the band stack up behind him with surprisingly technical musicianship. And even though the riffs might not knock around in the listener's head for as long as they did on \\"The Crusade,\\" they are still really good ones, and are punctuated by exceptional solos. Meanwhile, the bass tone is still quite fat, and the drumming is tight and precise.<br /><br />There is some tempo variation present in \\"Shogun,\\" as a cut like track eight, \\"He Who Spawned The Furies,\\" which despite having a couple of speedy excursions, is an overall slower and more involved venture, proves. But the vast majority of the set plays like a no-holds-barred thrash-fest through and through. And wrap it all up with contagious hooks and leaven it with just the right amount of melody, and the listener has no problem envisioning that the likes of Metallica, Testament, Vio-lence, and Exodus are looking down on Trivium and grinning from ear-to-ear.<br /><br />The album kicks off with its likely highpoint. And not only is \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" the set's epic, it is also, easily, one of the best songs that Trivium have ever penned. It begins by taking a page out of the Eighties thrash playbook, with a pretty acoustic (and almost flamenco-guitar-sounding) intro before, around 25 seconds in, exploding into a white-hot ball of energy. The opener climaxes with fiery modern thrash picking, quick and slamming drums, and hardcore-ish vocals. And all of this eventually gives way to an emo-lite, melodically-sung refrain that evokes modern metalcore almost to the tee. But back on the side of Eighties thrash, Trivium let rip an excellent, lengthy, inventive and technical guitar solo soon thereafter. Some chunky and thunderous breakdowns throughout, and the song also tosses in some heavy, humming bass lines and more exceptional clean vocals near the end. On the whole, this six and a half minute long epic comes across sounding like a cross between Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, Megadeth, and Slayer. And, needless to say, it really, really sets the bar high.<br /><br />But even if the rest of the album cannot quite match the same levels of excellence or irresistibility that \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" had, there are still plenty of other really good tracks. \\"Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis,\\" for example, evokes \\"Ride The Lightning\\"-era Metallica, marrying catchy, Metallica-esque vocals with fiery, crunching thrash riffage and pounding drums. It uncorks a batch of fast and complex guitar soloing, too. And the proceeding \\"Down From The Sky,\\" with its harmonized intro part, forceful drumming, grumbling bass lines, soaring melodic choruses, rhythmically staccato guitar hooks, and screaming solo, is another sizeable standout. And so is \\"In The Mouth Of Hell We March,\\" which might have good cop/bad cop vocals, where aggressive, metalcore-derived screams give way to sweet clean singing. But for the most part, it is the guitars that dominate the maelstrom, here, and do so with some seriously blistering shredding.<br /><br />Skipping ahead a little bit, \\"Insurrection\\" attacks like a piece of straight-up, Eighties-worthy thrash. Its impeccable, and often machine gun fast double time drumming anchors ripping, buzzsaw fast riffing. And some more wailing, technically-impressive soloing rips the air later on. \\"Of Prometheus And The Crucifix\\" is another brutal and breakneck guitar shred-fest with tons of rocket-propelled speed picking, including rip-roaring riffs, steamrolling leads,and fast and melodic soloing. And the last remarkable song on tap, here, is \\"Like Callisto To A Star In Heaven,\\" which has a really catchy, Iron Maiden/At The Gates-styled gallop threaded by solid, humming bass lines and well-placed double-kick drum thumps. And this extremely hooky number is further highlighted by a dead-on Hetfield impression from Heafy, eminently infectious and addictive choruses, and more shredding guitar solo flights.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Shogun\\" might not be quite as excellent as \\"The Crusade,\\" but it is nonetheless an all-around excellent follow-up, and a pretty darn great album in and by itself. And sure, it might be proof of the fact that there are still a few areas where Trivium could improve upon; but it also further proves that they are an extremely talented and potential-filled group of young musicians. And if \\"Shogun\\" doesn't please all Trivium fans the world over, I will eat my pants!and fast and melodic soloing.

B0090BZBNQ|5.0|She received this at Christmas time and is still playing with the reusable stickers. Great inexpensive gift for any little fashionista.<br />She really enjoys getting creative with the jewelry and accessory sheets.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Felt like watching a sales pitch for the lead actress, just was not that inserting.  Most of the performances where not very convincing.
B008220BLG|5.0|I love this movie (even though my friend got scared in half of the movie and I'm left in suspense). I really did love it though, It's like Romeo and Juliet ( the zombie's name is R, and the humane girl's name is Julie, Romeo Juliet, get it).
B004J64QSI|2.0|By now, fans know every line of the score. Cutting sections leaves awkward gaps where the listener anticipates words that never come.<br /><br />Casting was also less than optimal. Visually, Norm Lewis has the sternness and the drive for the role of Javert, but his voice lacks the emotional range that made Philip Quast's performance so memorable. Nick Jonas seems to be winking at the camera in every frame. Alfie Boe brings youth and vitality to his role... but Valjean is better known for his resignation and weariness.<br /><br />The physical placement of the actors on the stage did little to enhance my appreciation of this version. I had a hard time seeing the intimacy between the characters when they were standing half a stage apart using separate microphones.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I enjoyed this series. It had a fun concept and definitely enough action to entertain. My only problem, was that I didn't really fully connect to the characters. If someone died I wasn't sad. In the first book you realize everyone has lost their memories, and so there in lies the challenge for the author to get you to connect to these characters who don't even know themselves. I feel like it would have been possible. I love to laugh at the characters, get angry with them, cry, and just feel it all. A few times I had a couple emotions towards them. I'd still recommend this series because it does have a very interesting concept. And it's definitely young adult, even with the violence.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Steven King is one of my favorite authors so I tend to be a bias, I waited to purchase this book as I knew there was politics interjected into it, and Mr. King and I differ in that arena.  But as usual once I started I couldn't put this down.  So interesting and King puts you right in the middle of the action, I always feel that I'm one of his characters in his book's, just watching from afar.  Again an excellent book he NEVER disappoints.  Sorry I took so long to read it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great read! Suzanne Collins did a great job with this series.  Thought-provoking concepts and very interesting plot!
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|This movie has created a lot of buzz, and being a fan of Jennifer Lawrence I decided to stream it from Amazon Prime.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Amazon Prime, especially the shipping, so I consider the opportunity to stream movies, icing on the cake.<br /><br />The movie premise was far-fetched to me. I've seen this story line before. It turns out the whole affair wasn't my cup of tea. Probably if I was only a quarter old as I am now, I would have enjoyed it more.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|The story was intriguing but the movie was not well executed.  At times it was slow and boring.  The story ends with the viewer wanting more.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I opened this game, and did the download, but it just closed the app. I tried to reload, but it just closed again. if its kindle fire edition, shouldn't it be able to work on a kindle fire?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever, would be nice to introduce new powerups though.<br />I enjoy playing it, though sometimes gameplay is slow
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My Horse is a great game! I gave been scowering the Internet for a good horse game that lets you take care of your horse manually,  I'm so happy I found it however, I think they add too much value on gems and coins also this morning Itrued to open the app several times and it would show and stay at the home screen!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|love the episode and full of suspense. the sound quality is great. and keeps you at the edge of you seat.
B004MPJZGE|5.0|I saw this when it came out, back on VHS. It was awesome. It was one of the best horror movies I had ever seen. I'm a true horror fan and to this day I still remember this as a true classic. I have watched the current version and this one is still the best. I would definitely recommend, but it's not for the faint of heart. The story is unique in the fact that it follows through on every aspect. No loose ends and there isn't anything you don't understand. It's a true must see and classic for a horror fan. It's not the gore that grabs you, since it's not that bad (I've seen more and worse), it's the character and events that unfold. You have to watch it to appreciate it. Reviews won't give you the full impact.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I think we can all agree that these movies helped establish a lot of what we see today in film. A great trilogy by the Wachowskis as they continue to create great cinema.
B007I1Q4W2|3.0|I'm a huge horror fan. This had a complete storyline and dialogue which was pretty good. It wasn't much on the horror/gory side, so if you need the lighter end of horror this would work well. I enjoyed it, but if you are hard core this won't work for you.
B001FB55H6|4.0|Very rarely do we see a movie take the source material and transfer it to the big screen so well. Zack Snyder being a genuine fan of Watchmen did a great job with bringing a very good graphic novel to the big screen. Unfortunately this movie was not received well by the mass audience who did not know what exactly to expect when watching this film. The only gripe I had with this film was that it had too much slow motion. Picture and audio quality is great too.
1400067820|5.0|Even the title is unique. NNT had to make up a word as none exist. Yet a number of things are in fact anti-fragile. As an engineer we strive to make things robust, but some things go beyond this. It is possible to live life in an anti-fragile way, I plan on doing so now. But more important, he really debunks the so called experts is several fields. This is an authentic work, the author actually knows the subject in a deep way not some academic repackaging of others work, but genuine created from scratch knowledge. His sources when he does reference others are more often classical and ancient ones. I wish this was a mandatory class for freshmen in college. But so many professors would protest it loudly. He also speaks of optionality and the barbell strategy which I plan on making central to my future.<br />Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein have nothing on this guy and he is a lot easier to read.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Tarantino has done it again with the release of inglorious basterds. This is probably his best movie to date. And that is not an over rated statement in any way.
0670026603|4.0|This is a great book. The topic is eye opening. Disabled people do love and have sex!! This book finally gives this topic to really understand that disabled people are not asexual. There needs to be more stories of this genre!!!!
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Though a disturbing portrayal of American culture, this is a very insightful view into what our food industry has become. Watching this film will certainly help me make necessary changes in my choice and consumption of food products going forward.
B002RI9PS6|5.0|There is little attention to tractors (thank goodness) in this book but what is written about them is very interesting. The real thrust of the story is to explain the plight of the Ukrainian people in recent years and the culture of the Ukrainians living in the UK through the eyes of one particular family.What a wonderful story, incorporating into this tale a fresh and entertaining dose of humour.  The relationship between the 2 sisters, how this changes over time and what the relationship teaches them both about themselves is very well done.
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|This is a decently priced low-wattt LED screw-in light bulb. I went looking for these at Home Depot, but felt the LED bulbs were too pricey there, so I returned home and shopped instead on Amazon. I'm pretty happy with this money-saving light bulb.<br /><br />I try to live off the electrical grid and on my alternative energy solar systems as often as possible, so this kind of bulb is exactly what I need; it's even better than using compact florescent bulbs.<br /><br />My Kill-A-Watt device shows the bulbs is indeed only using 6 watts, which is a fantastic replacement for a typical 60 watt bulb. I use it readily at my desk for task work, and have also tested it for reading by my bed. The brightness is a little dimmer than a 60 watt incandescent, but not by much, and is sufficient for most activities. I'd want something brighter for doing brain surgery, but I really don't do much of that at home. ;-)<br /><br />The bulb screws right into a normal incandescent light bulb socket. It's not painful to look directly at the bulb, since it's frosted. My plan is to replace all of my CFLs with low watt LEDs eventually, and I expect the price will come down over time, just as CFLs did.<br /><br />Well recommended for people needing to conserve watts, or looking to cut their energy costs at an entry level price.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is way better than the built in swype.  I used the trial for a while then thought I could just settle for swype.  Nope.  Swiftkey won me over.  The predictive text is great.  Most other keyboards are frustrating for me to use, this one is not.<br /><br />The only thing that might make it better is some sort of handwriting recognition.

B005EGXTL2|5.0|Couldnt wait to get started on the sequel to The Hunger Games.  Read it in a few days. Loved it
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I thought it was really slow moving.  It had a good subject though and I loved the main characters.  They make a good couple.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Worried that the book would not be as good as the movie.  Guess what... It was even better.  Loved every minute of it.  This was the first eBook I have read.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I thought that Hotel Transylvania was a very good movie and also pretty funny.  Loved it.  I would recommend it
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Cant stop reading it.  Its spellbinding. I never imagined that I would enjoy this type of story.  Its well writtn and really gets you in.
B0091REZMW|5.0|the puzzels are fun and exciting its a great experience you'll never want to put this game down. I enjoy this game and I know that anyone who likes puzzels will also envy this.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this series.  Can't wait for the movies to come out.  Movie was also as good as the book.  Thats rare.  Would purchase other books by Ms. Collins.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a first class page-turner.  The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was the ending. At the risk of being a spoiler, I'll say no more
B000SGSU58|4.0|I've never been disappointed with Michael Connellys writing.  Always suspenseful and keeps your interest.  Am looking for more of his books to purchase.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I have not seen the show regularly, and I'm not a fan. Still Fey's funny and self-depreating style of writing keeps you going with the story.

B009186JYI|3.0|The stream of old/new material of the Rolling Stones seems endless. This b/w documentary from the 60's is nicely restored, which adds to the viewing experience. Only for diehard fans.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|The film kept me at awe all the way to the end. I recommend this film to however want to start in a field of psychology of for those curious minds out there.
B0030T1NAO|4.0|The second season has a lot more going on than season 1 and isn't as boring. The Blu-Ray quality is still poor at best and doesn't look near as crisp as other Blu-Rays that I own. Hopefully season 3 will be better quality.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I absolutely love this film. It made me feel like I was there in that period, especially the dance at the Assembly, and some of the interior shots of their home. It just felt authentic to me. I loved the Colin Firth version, but this is superior, and the most memorable scene of all was Darcy walking towards Lizzie in the morning fog... coming to tell her he loves here and wants to marry her. His walk was very powerful and the atmosphere the director chose was moving. This is one of my favorite films of all time. It just appeals to ME.
B003274QH6|4.0|As I stated in the title the show starts extremely slow but gets very good in the last few episodes of the season. The Blu-Ray quality is poor at best and doesn't look near as crisp as other Blu-Rays that I own.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Another Angry Birds game is always welcomed in my house! My 5 year old grandson loves it and plays for about 15 minutes a day. He'd play longer, but we set limits on game play. This edition, at least for Kindle, has power up items that are given for free throughout the game, but can also be bought. To prevent accidental purchases by the kids, I simply set up a password that must be used to purchase anything. Oh, and the graphics are really good on this app as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like the challenge especially when I am in a position of waiting (Dr. Off, waiting for something when I'm not at home.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|No one but Stephen King could have come up with a fictional masterpiece that shares his belief that Owald killed Kennedy and acted alone. He did a lot of research for this book and I couldn't put it down. It will make you happy and sad. It will make you laugh and cry. And, of course, it will give you chills as only a work by Stephen King could do.
0765325950|4.0|I would give this 3 1/2 stars, but not an option.  Maybe it is just because I am wishing there was going to be another book.  Living with a series for 20 years might do that to a person.

B007THA4FI|5.0|While it wasn't the murder mystery I was expecting, I disagree with those who felt it was too long.  J.K. Rowling has a talent for seeing the thought processes in depth of her entire cast of characters, and I found it challenging and downright eerie how much she understands the pettiness and myopia even the most respected citizens harbor.  It was a true study of how a population's diverse outlooks can converge into action that can be either galvanizing or devastating.  I loved the challenge and hope she continues in this vein in the future.
0143119680|3.0|I honestly believe that if Ms. Harkness had not read/studied the \\"Twilight\\" series that this book would not have been written.  SO much similarity.  Very disappointing.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I've only had this for a few weeks and I've already gotten so many complements! It really does look a lot like an old book, which I love! Plus it is very sturdy and the straps hold it in place very well. There is a small sleeve inside to keep many a gift card or note. Would definitely recommend this cover.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for something that would allow you to stand your kindle up, this might not be for you. I can get it to stand up horizontally by propping it up with the front cover, but it doesn't stay that way very well.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I waited a whileto watch this flick because of all the hype. The hype was NOT wrong on this one,outstanding visual effects & animation is perfect.
1451696191|5.0|no need to say anything other than I loved it, it's my new favorite, and I am going to read it again right away. I have never read a book twice in a row. It was that good. Now I am going to see if this author has any more great books for me to read afterward.

1616550414|5.0|I am so used to collectors items for video games being cheaply made that for some reason i thought this would be some small book with very little content.<br /><br />I was very wrong. This book is BIG and packed with content. Printed on good quality paper.<br /><br />No complaints on this item right here. It is a must have for any Zelda fan.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have this friend named Stephen King. OK, I've never actually met the man, but he's told me lots of stories and I'm fond of the guy. I've realized lately that I think of him as a friend, a buddy, a guy I like to hang out with.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Steve. A lot of people don't like him. \\"Your friend Steve,\\" they say to me, \\"He's weird. He thinks about horrible things. He writes about horrible things. And Christ, when they make movies of his stories, they really tend to suck.\\" All those things are true, some times. Maybe most times. My pal Steve has written some stories that are way too gross for me, some stories that just don't work and some things that go on way too long. And some horrible (not just horror, but horrible) movies have been made with his name attached to them. But then there's \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Misery\\".<br /><br />Here's the deal about my buddy Steve: the man can tell a story. He makes me care about the people in it. This doesn't happen every time, with every book of his, but when it does, BAM! he's got me and I'm along for the ride.<br /><br />With his book 11/22/63, Stephen King got me. I resisted for a while, the book's a monster, damn near 900 pages, but Amazon had it as a deal on the Kindle version. What the hell, it's lighter to carry and that buy button is too freakin easy.<br /><br />Three days. I slammed through the book in three days. I stayed up late, I got up early. I loved this book.<br /><br />You can read the blurbs on Amazon or somewhere else. Time travel. A guy goes back in time to stop the Kennedy assassination. You may be thinking, not my kind of thing. Or \\"I hate Stephen King\\" stories. I hope you'll think again.<br /><br />The master stroke in this book is the voice of Jake, the narrator, a 35 year old English teacher. I believed Jake's voice from page one. I cared about what he cared about. I was as incredulous as he was when we first encounter the time portal, but I had to try to figure out how it worked, what could be done. Who cares about Kennedy, can I use this to help my friend?<br /><br />Page by page, I did care. I had to care. I had to know. I didn't know if Jake could change history, but I knew he had to try. I knew I had to try.<br /><br />Yes, it's a Stephen King story. There's some gross stuff there. There's a little bit of scary stuff there. But there's a whole lot world there, with people you'd risk everything to save.<br /><br />11/22/63 is one of the best books I've ever read. It's a long book that doesn't feel long, it rockets along and then it lingers in your mind. It's a magic trick and a time machine. It's a puzzle of a story where big things happen but it's the smallest things that matter.<br /><br />Try it. Get a few chapters in. If you can stop, if you don't care, walk away. It's not your thing. Nothing wrong with that, not all stories are for all readers. But I think you'll stay.<br /><br />My buddy Stephen King has written a masterpiece.

0321885112|5.0|Mike Rhode's Sketchnote Handbook (the video edition) is a thorough guide to creating notes that are both more memorable and probably more useful than the standard way people have been taking notes for years.The book is only seven chapters: he has written a practical guide with few words and many pictures, yet he covers everything from basic materials to a visual guide of different ways to organize content on the page. He avoids the formal language of graphic design for the most part, using layman's terms for the shapes and patterns that anyone can see on a page and copy for themselves. Likewise, in his videos, he encourages the self-defining \\"non-artistic type\\" to focus on how to use writing and organizing the content as a starting place, and places more emphasis on active listening and summarizing or using simple visual ideas to make powerful notes. By providing some simple images and ways to draw faces and figures with a few lines, dots and curves, he shows how to move beyond just words to get images into the budding sketchnoter's visual vocabulary.<br /><br />Printed in two colors on creamy thick paper, the book itself is a joy to hold and browse through, as he has filled the pages not only with his own sketchnotes, but examples from other sketchnoters from a cross-section of disciplines, proving that sketchnotes aren't just the domain of artists. The sketchnotes of software developers, teachers, user experience designers and others are interspersed throughout the seven chapters of the book and the videos (full disclosure: one of my sketchnotes are seen as he scrolls through examples of sketchnotes on an iPad in one of the videos).<br /><br />I suggest you fill the workbook pages to get the full benefit of this visual thinking toolkit. Even if you don't intend on sharing your sketchnotes with others, I believe that once you get started making sketchnotes through Mike Rhode's method, you'll find you will be compelled to show others why you're doing a better job at remembering events and conversations you've put down on paper (or iPad) in this creative way.remembering events and conversations you've put down on paper (or iPad) in this creative way.
B001I8A76A|3.0|I would describe this album the same way I'd describe Pink herself: decent, but forgettable.  There are definitely some solid tracks on here, with &#34;Please Don't Leave Me&#34; being the clear standout, and there's nothing that I'd call outright bad.  However, like most pop music, this is all quite ephemeral, and none of it really stuck with me.  Fans of Pink, I imagine, will enjoy it, but newcomers like myself will probably not be all that impressed.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This is the best case for the kindle because not only is it durable but it makes a great stand for watching movies.
B004G6009K|5.0|This is a great movie in 2D.  If you add the 3D to the movie, you know feel like you get to interact with them in the movie.  The lantern and water escape scenes are great!  3D adds so much more depth to the movie - if you ever get a chance to have 2 tv's right next to each other with the same movie playing simultaneously, one in 3D and one in regular blu-ray, you will realize how much difference 3D adds to the experience.  They did a great job with this one.  I recommend this to any 3D TV owner with, and without kids!
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|I just received the blu ray I purchased on amazon in the US featuring the UK version of the show, which is the only version available. We watched episode 6 on the blu ray just as it was airing on tv here in the US. We happened to see the episode on TV after we saw it on blu ray and were shocked to discover that the blu ray did not include key moments compared to what was shown on television. For instance, there's a key scene in which Mrs O'Brian tells Thomas that the new valet has a crush on him, leading him on. This scene is not in the episode on the blu ray. In addition, there are several moments of dialogue missing from other scenes. Consequently, DO NOT WATCH THE BLU RAY BELIEVING YOU'RE SEEING THE FULL VERSION. I will not see the next episodes on blu ray because I'm certain I will be missing key moments. My guess is that in the UK they have commercials and they need shorter episodes than in the US, where the series airs with no commercial interruption. In summary, unless there's an American version of the show in blu ray coming up, which I doubt, I recommend that you watch the show live on television in the US and you don't buy this UK version now on sale in amazon.

B00AIBZLVY|3.0|What I liked most about MAMA was that I'd not seen this 'movie' before. While there are scenes reminiscent of other horror films, the story flows in a unique fashion, and the two kids protray their roles extremely well. In fact, better than extremely well. I also enjoyed the surreal nature that was interjected into the production. Is this a major horror film? Maybe not, but fans of the genre will not be dissapointed by it.

143353083X|3.0|While the ESV has aided in my bible study and understanding, I have found myself questioning the validity of it due to what I see as one (known) glaring error.<br />I am a staunch supporter of children's rights, and I do not believe that spanking a child is biblical.  Before you flip out on me, please take a deep breath then read this: [...]<br />But despite the fact that the Hebrew references are made to older children (teen+), the ESV uses the modern day interpretation to mean child as in young child to state corporal punishment is biblical.<br />Once I saw that the authors of the ESV were twisting scripture, it made me wonder what else in the work might be completely off base.  Thus, take it with a grain of salt.  I usually read it alongside my NIV, The Message, and several internet sites.  It is a worthwhile resource, but as with all things, it is good to do your own research and dig deeper to further your own understanding.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Great book to read with my 9 year old. We were fond of the movie and now we are excited to see the difference between the two.  On to the next book...
0765325950|4.0|The writing was very good, and the overall thread of the book did finish.  But so many of the sub plots were not treated to completion. it makes you think that they editors want the fans to demand one more book.  The story is not completed.  Many of the subplots ended as if by after thought.
0446554995|5.0|I've followed the entire Pendergast series and this book still amazed me with it's unexpected twists and surprises.

B00006FM77|3.0|***Describing original release (4x LP) in VG+ condition.  Which should be fairly equivalent to these digital formats...give and take the better technology today, but fresher master tapes back then.<br /><br />Carnegie Hall is a brutal place.  There is nowhere to hide on that stage and all tics come to the forefront.  Hearing some of the favorites without the studio magic was disillusioning.  To be specific, trombone was recorded way too loud and of nasty tone quality particularly on disc 1 and 2.  Some songs had the wrong tempo without any other stylistic changes, and you would be surprised how much life of a song can die by taking just 5% off the tempo.  Other songs were played \\"bluesier\\", and seemed dumbed down.<br /><br />Extras included a bunch of big pictures in books and posters.  Mostly lo-resolution closeups, they make the guys look pretty granola.  I really like to pin up my record jackets, but I left the extras in the box.<br /><br />Humorous note:  On Fancy Colours somebody says \\"Imagine two windchimes, one on each side of your head\\" b/c they had no chimes on stage.  Yes, that did detract slightly from the  song but moreso it illustrates the level of compromise in this production.  I've heard good live albums from the 70's and I wouldn't include this one.<br /><br />There's no real need for a box set as you can simply own Chicago I-III and enjoy much more content in much better quality.
B007O4XX9K|3.0|I looked forward to Joe's long-awaited CD but it fell short of my expectations.

Joe, go back to the studio and let 'er rip!!

0470913029|4.0|This book is very good at explaining the reason behind why so many health problems such as obesity exists. I do believe it is a little bit of a stretch to say that genetically we are programmed to eat this way, and I also believe that some foods that the book views as being unhealthy for you are in fact quite good for you. Besides the minor indescrepancies about certain healthy and non-healthy food choices, it was a great book and a good diet. I believe &#34;The Great Cholesterol Myth&#34; to be a better overall diet vs the Paleo Diet however the diets are about 90 % similar except for a few food choices.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|Here we have a 2010 Norwegian film, (obviously low budget), which will highly entertain an intelligent and fun-loving person for, what...? 103 minutes according to the Internet Movie Data Base [IMDB]. If you are fairly stupid, you probably won't like it at all because you'll simply say something like, \\"There's no such thing as trolls!\\" and lose interest. But there ARE trolls! I'm 59 and I never knew this until I watched the film.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is presented in a semi-documentary format and it's all about a few college students who begin to follow this mysterious \\"suspected bear poacher\\" around to catch him in the act. The fact is, he's a government-sponsored troll-hunter and he's more than a bit wearied of being unappreciated by his noxious boss for all the dangerous and worthwhile work he does. (He even has to fill out lengthy troll-kill forms.) So he relents and allows the college students to shadow him as he carries out the daily, (actually, nightly), hazardous drudgery of troll-hunting.<br /><br />Something is up with these trolls -- they are not staying in the remote regions as they are supposed to. And when they get into districts populated by humans, of course, the trouble begins: property damage, the Norwegian Government has to pull fast cover-ups, etc., (as a public knowledge that trolls exist would cause a general panic -- it would be like proving and revealing that there was no God. Everything would just collapse.)<br /><br />Plus you get lots of terrific tips on where to look for trolls. (Under bridges is a major hot spot!), how to recognize troll sign, how to bait them, and how to deal with them when you have one cornered, (or, when one has *you* cornered.) In fact, I have experienced NO troll problems whatever since I have viewed this film and commenced my own troll eradication program hereabouts in the woods near my home. So the film is more than entertaining -- it's useful too.<br /><br />If you are on the fence with this one, just go to You Tube and watch the trailer or a few clips. But honestly, it's better to watch the film from the beginning as it develops. It will definitely draw you in. Subtitled in English.<br /><br />Highly recommended!o You Tube and watch the trailer or a few clips. But honestly, it's better to watch the film from the beginning as it develops.

I really like the way they did the Stone Giant. The movie has a very organic feel to it that is quite nice.

The video transfer to blu ray will not show a night and day difference between the Standard Def DVD and the Blu Ray version but there is some noticeable improvement.  The details are sharper and the contrast is really quite good.  I noticed that all the skin tones appeared very natural as well.  No noticeable grain, artifacts or aliasing anywhere that I could see.  Some of the CGI effects, being an older film, were a bit more obvious to me than when I first saw the movie, but you really have to consciously look for them, as I often tend to do, and most viewers don't.  Nice details in the darker, more shadowy areas as well.  As I said, while the video jump to Blu Ray is not huge, it is an improvement and 4 star worthy.<br /><br />The audio is Dolby Digital lossless 5.1 and it makes for a big difference.  Be careful, the film does default to a lossy DD and even in the language settings, it is the lossy audio that is top of the list of choices.  I realized this a few minutes in when I could hear the compression of the audio.  I went back to the settings and changed it to the lossless and it was like a film being removed from your eyes and ears.  Lossless audio does make for a huge difference in any BluRay disc.  The film uses your entire surround system for both ambiance and foley fx with excellent panning between the front and rear stages as well as discreet directional channeling to the sides.  To use the audio of Twister as a DEMO disc for your system would not be an unwise choice.  Because there is so much wind and noise turbulence generated in the film, and thus your surround system, you find yourself fully engulfed in the storms themselves.  Really well done..5 stars for the audio.<br /><br />In addition to the usual commentary there are 2 Twister trailers, a making of doc, and a couple of documentaries the twisters themselves and how several of the effects were accomplished.  A music video was also included which I haven't watched as yet.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I hope that this series has many season yet to come.  This DVD, like those that preceded it, also includes some extra features (I wonderful addition, though the storyline easily stands on its own, one just ends with a deep desire to know more, and the special features do much to satisfy that thirst.)<br />Highly recommend this DVD.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|I have now heard a few albums from Ludovico Einaudi which a friend put me onto this pianist. After listen to other pianist I found Ludovico to be in a class of his own.  I love it, was awesome and I could listen to it all day long.
B00914JWSW|4.0|If you love Barbra's music, you'll love this CD.  I recommend this CD.  Add it to your collection and enjoy.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Rachel Joyce writes about an unlikely pilgrimage of a man but in reality this is anyone's pilgrimage. The book takes you on your own journey as you travel with Harold Fry.  What have you done with your life, what are your regrets and or triumphs.  Harold Fry helps you  discover
B000003N7F|1.0|I most have not read the smallprint---who--  tell me who --orders vinyl today--- I sent this to a friend and was floored when he said he got a record instead of a cd --so that is my issue
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a big fantasy reader but had never delved into this series until now. I was nervous at the length, afraid the story would be drawn out and slow. Quite the opposite. This author keeps the pages turning, weaving multiple storylines throughout that keep you reading to find out what is happening to all the different characters, leaving one just as something exciting happens to rehash another one might have forgotten about.<br /><br />There is so much going on in this series, the great hosts of characters are confusing yet the author seems to know this and is constantly reminding the reader who everyone is. I blazed through the thick tome in less than two weeks and had to wait for a paycheck to buy the next in the series, which was the only complaint I have this far.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves enthralling, vivid stories set in large, fantastical worlds. Great read.
B00005MP58|5.0|Amazing movie and awsome acting for the main characters. Colin Firth did a great job. Anyone who loves this story NEEDS this movie. Seriously. Buy it....just buy it!
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I believe Khan ( The original singer is awesome and ranks up there with Geoffe Tate of Queensryche).<br />However, due to circumstances unknown to me Khan decided to step down and let someone else take the reins.<br />The Album is excellent and well produced.<br />The new singer sounds very similar to Khan, maybe a slight bit higher in voice but very talented.<br />The group went all out on this one and deserves a listen.  Enjoy!<br /><br />JD
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!! This is the best game ever I tell everyone to get it because it rocks. The first day I got this I got addected and wouldn't put it down.@
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another great book by Stephen King. An interesting story line taken from real life events. Hard to put down which is my kind of book.
030758836X|4.0|This was the first book I read by Ms. Flynn.  The beginning was hard to understand at first-was Nick imagining all these gruesome thoughts or was this really happening?  As I got more into the book things made more sense.  At first you think Nick is the crazy one and that Amy is this poor little heartbroken wife but then boy do you get surprised-Amy-what a wack nut!  The book held my interest and I couldn't put it down because I wanted to always find out what happened next.  I do have to say I wish that Amy would have gotten caught or that Nick would have gotten her back in a real bad way-what a psycho-their poor child destined to live a dysfunctional life-and who knows-he may be the psycho in a possible sequel!  All in all it was a good read.  Suspenseful, thrilling, and cleverly written.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season so far has been an intensely emotional graphic journey. Lots of hard moments, but alot more action that the prior season.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really good graphics, challenging, and fun! Good for ages four to forty. My brothers and even my mom like to play it.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons, but the 3rd has been a disappointment!!  While 3rd season is nice, it's not the same level of writing or plot development and terminating the second character (no spoils here) is ridiculous, given all the other circumstances.  Good luck to the show, but I'll skip any future seasons and hope to catch Maggie Smith in something else.
B001GMQALY|4.0|I was kind of disappointed. I love this moving, but some of the scenes from the original were missing. I'm guessing they may have be a little racy, but this whole move plays on the edge. If parts are to be edited out, that should be stated up front upon purchasing. The movie itself is flirty and edgy for it's time. I really like Mickey Rourke in this film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I baby-sit for my grandsons, the 5 yr old loves to play Temple Run on my Kindle Fire.  Now I have this new game  to have him enjoy.  I love watching him play the games.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So, when I first purchased this book for my kindle, I dove right into it to see what all the fuss was about. I barely made it to the first 'vanilla scene' and threw in the white flag. After about 5 months I decided to give it another try. So here is my official review.<br /><br />I want to start off by saying how hard it was for me to get past the first couple chapters. I felt that Christian fell out of character quite a bit, by I ended up liking him a great deal more than Ana towards the end of the book. With that said, I didn't mine Ana at first, but then I ended up not being able to stand her. She is was too wayward. Also, I feel her insecurity is way over done. Now, I understand  it is realistic in regards that most new relationships have insecurity issues, especially with this kind of relationship, but I feel it was too much. This was especially tweaked my nerves when I felt that once she presented her issues to Christian and he appeased her worries, it wasn't long before the same issue was brought up again. It was very repetitive.<br /><br />As for Christian, in the beginning I felt like he fell out of character a lot. However, I did like how he took it easy on her at first. Also, I like the slow revealing of his past; it keeps the readers guessing. All in all, his character seemed 'meh' to me towards the end.<br /><br />In my opinion, do I dare say, the was almost TOO much sex. Speaking of the sex, let's be realistic in the topic of Ana's orgasms, shall we? Whatever she is on, I want some because that just doesn't happen.<br /><br />All in all, the plot of the smut story is not SO bad. I will continue to read the others and will give my reviews on them as well.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app works great I can listen a lot of good stations for free. The app works great and easy to use.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Nothing wrong with this movie. Got it for the kids, but it's a great show for all ages. I usually don't watch movies more than once, but this one I did.
B0001KL5DA|4.0|This was exactly what I wanted. Great product for those with on off and dark sense of humor. Highly recommended
B00005JNX0|5.0|A great family movie that makes grownups laugh - oh, the kids love it too. It's worth having in your DVD collection
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Once you start you'll wanna read it from beginning to end without stopping. It makes you feel like a kid again, with no limits to your imagination.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I'll search for the movie! It's both sad, emoutional and when you first have started reading, you don't leave it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome and cool app. Almost as good as temple run really close<br />to being that good awesome
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is better than the first Temple Run.  There are more obstacles in the game making it more interesting.
B001P06GX4|5.0|the best game ever...all the family enjoy it.we are happy that we finally played this game.thanks  a lot.have a nice day
B00170I7GG|5.0|Though this is has been around awhile, the plot is wonderful, the comedy droll, and it's the perfect way to celebrate Feb. 2nd every year.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|A great old classic, and I am glad I read it.  It was not, however, my most enjoyable reading experience. Still, I do not regret the choice, and I recommend this one to anybody interested in refreshing or adding to their classics list of books read.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My family ranges in age from just under 3 to 38. Each of us found something to enjoy in this movie, whether it was the slapstick visuals or some of the more complex humor. Overall it was a good time for us watching it.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a charming and enjoyable movie. The Indian setting is interesting and provides a background against which the characters explore how they will live the rest of their lives. It has a great cast with very good performances.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great film! An interesting story told in a compelling way. Music was fantastic - can't wait to buy the soundtrack!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Loved watching this with my grandaughter.  She has enjoyed watching it many times as has her brother. Its one our family will enjoy over and ovmer
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|When this movie came out in theaters I thought &#34;Seriously and adult movie about a teddy bear&#34;? However when it was available to rent people kept saying how funny it was so I rented it. It was hilarious! Much funnier then I ever thought it would be. I recommend if you want a good laugh. The ending was a bit odd, but hey it is a talking teddy bear movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this book. My emotions were pulled in several directions up to the very end. Great read.  I couldn't put it down.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I thought the book was very strange.  I do not like to read books with bad language in them, because that really bothers me.  If it came out to be a movie, I would not go and see it. The characters in the book did not seem believable to me. If you want to read a good mystery about a missing person, I suggest that one reads The Shack.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|Thought I had seen this movie but seeing this restored print with the missing scenes was like seeing it for the<br />very first time! Also many years have passed & now  am veiwing it with older & more discerning eyes.
0375869026|5.0|This is an awesome story. I read it before putting it our for my students.  It supports our character traits.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|We've gotten lego Star Wars advent claendars before and every year the price jumps and every year you get a little less.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This is a great app for my five year old daughter. She is really enjoying playing with it. There is some reading but not so much that she is constantly interrupting me. She loves taking care of her pets and unlocking new ones to play with. I just wish that, since this is geared towards kids, they could earn the money and gems they need to unlock new features faster. I won't charge my Visa for the additional coins (which are expensive) and the items the child can buy (places for the pets to go, housing, play toys, etc) cost a lot of the &#34;free&#34; coins.  It takes a long time to gather enough free coins to get anything so we'll see how long it keeps her attention.
B008469DGY|5.0|Once you start playing it is hard to put it down. This App is on all of my devices, Thanks for a great app.<br /><br />DBWeimer<br />Rochester NY
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a pretty fun strategy game. The constant reminders to purchase stuff or post on facebook is tedious, though.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the differences but just seems a little slow needs more explores the bonuses need to last longer  and a map might make it a little better
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everyone in the family loves it. Mesmerizing and engaging. My husband can't put it down. I guess we will have to break down and purchase the next version!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I am not very good at this game. It moves very fast, and I kill my avatar a lot. I will keep trying, as it is probably good for the brain and teaching eye to hand function. I might even get better at it and let my guy live a little longer.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|We really can play it when connected online. Not much you can do and it seems a bit boring to me. However my girls are LPS fans and love the characters. Not really sure what the point of the game is.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love this game its awesome the the highest extent!!!!it is amazeing super happy sad sporty game i n the world it makesmeabetter per handlet
B0009FTXGI|5.0|This works just as good as the cannon lens hood which I replaced after cracking it.  The price is right and why spend a ton of money on something that is just as good.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was not expecting this app to be any good at all but its really nice like you can play up to ten sounds at the same time. and customize the time it plays
B00006RAKP|5.0|If you're old school like me, you will not regret having this CD set.  It's much more economical to purchase this than download multiple songs at .99 each.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a pretty cool game to play and it is easy to get tokens to unlock more games to play
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app! its so fun and has wonderful grahics no blur and I live in an area. I cant have horses so this app makes me feel like I have one
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I started her off with the FREE Dr Panda daycare. She enjoys that app so much that I paid for the daycare app (and I'm glad I did - being able to move around all the rooms does make a difference).  With that app as a sucess, I paid for the Hospital app since she loves the Doc McStuffins show.  This app is a little harder for her, so I've noticed that she will flip back to the Daycare one after 10-15 min....but can tell that in about 6 mths this will be more challenging for her than the daycare app...so it's worth the 1.99 cost
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Since last couple of updates music won't be cached for offline listening. Is stupid having to wait for songs to be buffered when you already listened to the song one minute ago. Amazon... You are killing my data cap. I will download all my music and upload it to Google Play. Also,  all my future music purchases will be done in Google Play... This is really stupid and annoying, not to mention expensive.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Always saw this app in the store so decided to try it and was surprised was lots of fun really recommend getting it.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|SANS ATTENDRE:<br /><br /> I AM A FAN OF CELINE'S. I AM ALSO A FRENCH PROFESSOR AND APART FROM HAVING A GREAT TEACHING TOOL IN THIS CD, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE. IT'S REALLY FANTASTIC!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my friend are addicted to sub way surfers and my friend think the game is apsalootly amazing from Katrina
1475143389|5.0|This book covers every angle from dieting to your dream workout rutine into a healthy mind and body . Filled with great energy , passion and knowledge , this is the book to have at any level , I will pass it to my son as well , defenitly change my life for the better , Thank you so much Mike , God bless !!!!
0307386171|3.0|This story was well scripted, but the storyline left me disappointed, and the quick wrap up ending was a let down.  This poignant detailed look at the overwrought missteps of the 'first night' was unnerving, yet I felt totally compassionate for both.  You really got to feel for these two people.  But when Florence walks away...it seemed so unrealistic for these two people who loved each other to just dissolve into nothingness without a hint of a fight.  You're left asking  That was it?  Really?  It was like the sad, empty ending was a trick played on the reader. You end up feeling like the neighbour invited to know too many intense and intimate details, then left hanging when the couple leave town.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Worth getting, did not think that it was too gorry or violent.  Pretty cool  3D.  Plot was OK, but not great.
0525953728|3.0|At the end of this book, the authors make it clear their two intentions for publishing the first-hand account of the Navy SEALS' killing of the world's most wanted terrorist.  First, it's to raise money for the Seals' fallen comrades, and second it's to tell the world that the Seals did the deed for country, not to help re-elect President Obama (who, by the way, never did follow up on his beer at the White House invitation to the SEALS team six.<br /><br />As it stands, it doesn't matter why the authors wrote this book.  Having made their millions, they and this book will quickly be forgotten.  There's nothing particularly enlightening in this book (except for the fact that the fallback plan in case of mission failure was $200 to bribe their way out of Pakistan), and now with the release of \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" there's nothing particularly informative about this book either.
B00447G2PM|4.0|I like the 3D for the effects . . . the fish seemed to float out of the TV and the grandkids tried to grab them.  Pretty good 3D movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Simply addicting! I love this game. I wish it was a little easier to get gems. Good for all ages as long as you can read or have someone that can read for you, my 5 year old lives it as much as I do
B00867GKIK|4.0|Definately worth getting.  But don't expect too much from the 3D side of things.  Paid about $32, would rather pay $20 for these 3D movies.
1451673442|5.0|I am doing it for my 2nd time now, and absolutely LOVE all of the exercises in gratitude.  Life-changing book, I bought 20 to give to people I love so they can experience it too. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Was impressed with how easy it was to get started and understand what I was doing. This will come in very handy for my business and home.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  It's like a soap but much more exciting.  It's not predictable - which is suprising to find!
B001EC2J20|5.0|This movie is awesome, timeless classic, quiet heavy on content, must pay attention to understand what is going on. It is quiet different than the first Matrix. Visually still stunning.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One of the best games I played its features are great it is a awesome game you can be friends it is very cool.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy; however, I'm a bit indifferent as to how I feel about the finale. Regardless, it was a good read and a bit of a tear jerker.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Think this is the most witty, exciting, series on television.  Hope the producers of this series don't run out of dialogue.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my stepdad and I think he quite nearly squealed with joy. He is really enjoying it and I'm so glad that I was able to get him something that he liked so much. If you (or someone you are shopping for) is a Batman fan, this is definitely a boxset to have.
1451695187|4.0|I remember seeing this Dr on TV many times.  His face was a face of &#34;I don't believe a word!  That's why<br />it was so very interesting to read his account of a near-death experience.  Isn't it funny that until something<br />happens to US, we cannot believe.<br />Dr Alexander's travel to the Heavens and to the unknown is simply fascinating.  If you are interested in this<br />type of thing, you will enjoy the book.
B004ODLUF8|5.0|I am not one to be called a 'space nerd' but when I saw this film in an imax in SC, I fell in love. I really wish I had a 3-D TV so I could enjoy all the work that the team put into making the 3-D blue ray, but it's astounding enough in 2-D on my mac.<br />I love watching films like this, but tend to get nervous because I don't have a similar world view as many of the film makers or the scientists they quote. Yet, in this film I was not bombarded with someone's personal beliefs or the views, but what they see as facts and the astounding images of the universe.<br />(Creationists, you will hear a bit about millions of years ago and the big bang, but it's not offensive or really too noticeable.)<br />This film just shows the amazing sights out there.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|This book is very insightful and helpful not just at identifying a person's mindset, but at helping change it, particularly for yourself or your kids.
B001ANSS5K|3.0|It was alright. Expected more though, especially after reading looking for Alaska. That was a decent book. Damn these 3 words
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I was a little worried when the gangster rap came on and the main guy shot his icegun at the crowded coffee shop, but that was pretty much the worst thing that happened, the rest was just fun.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I saw Blue Sky Riders in Lowell, MA in an outside venue as the pre-band to the Kenny Loggins concert.  We were pleasantly surprised at the music and the harmony of the 3. They were all fabulous!  I then took a trip to Nashville the following month and went to the Bluebird Cafe.  Georgia was in the audience and was called up to sing a few songs. I was introduced to her after the show and she was so nice!  She told me about the release of their debut album in January. I have been waiting for this and am very excited it is finally here!  BSR is not to miss!
B002APU580|5.0|The acting is so good, this is such a romantic film, makes you believe in  passion and romance, also the scenery is just breath taking, almost like you were there.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Like most other readers of the Reacher novels, I can't pick a bad one. Some may appeal more to one than the next person, but they are always so apt to the background that is portrayed as Jack's past. &#34;A Wanted Man&#34; is no different...........it takes but a few pages to pick up from a walk into a full-on run and does not slow down until the end.<br />Child proves at every turn that in Reacher, he has a character that should go down as a legend in literary history and this is a tribute to his creator - thank you Lee Child.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Not what I expected.  It is not a continuation of Season 1.  Very different story line and takes a few shows to really get in to the plot.  Its depressing and hard grit, but the final episode (13) pulls it all together.  Great acting, suspencefull for sure.  Hope season 3 is better!
B00280LYIM|5.0|At the end it leaves you at a complete cliff hanger and it's very exciting. I can't wait to read the next book. :-)
B00000DWHG|4.0|A flawed album...but some good music. Townshend was banging his head against the wall for material while Keith Moon was out of control. Pete struggled to keep Moonie up to speed during the recording sessions which did not go smoothly.<br /><br />Still, a must have for who fans.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Easy to play, fun, original and healthy game.<br />Great quality cards.<br />It can be combined with any of the other DIXIT games.<br />Well awarded game of the year!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This is by far one of my favorites by Tim Burton so far. The voice acting was phenomenal. The story was great and my niece likes it alot and that makes me happy. One of my favorite characters is the new science teacher because I think he is funny. The animation of everything was so crystal clear. I can't wait to see what Tim Burton is going to make in the future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do you update it tho? Really great game 5 star all around. Love it recommend it to all ages even cup players
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very hady and useful app for your phone on the go. I'd advise anyone to give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because you don't have to tilt the device. When I was looking at the app I thought that it was a subway sandwich game.
B009PF93LS|5.0|Great CD..  He has such a remarkable voice,<br /> He took some original songs and be a twist to them and made a few new ones.  Very upbeat and fun to listen to.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game. Easy, but challenging at times. Could be easier to unlock other characters. But all together it is a pretty good game.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The end seemed a little rushed.  Not normal for Tom Clancey.  Seemed like a deadline was in sight and they rushed to finish it.
034580404X|5.0|i love these book and i found them for a great price and ready for more to come out and most deff will come back to order them from yall love it and Amazon
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is a great way to overcome boredom. I adore that you don't need to buy coins, but you can. You can also get free coins by achieving a goal. This app has never slowed my kindle down. Overall, I believe this is a great app to purchase for free, for all ages.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|its the ALBUM<br />you wont be disappointed!!<br />get it before you regret.<br />hear it all around the world<br />and the peace will come
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas. I think we watched the whole thing in a one day &#34;marathon.&#34; Once we started, we were hooked. Can't wait for the next season!
1457514508|2.0|I love a good murder mystery and thought this sounded like one.  I was saddened to find out I was wrong.<br /><br />The story didn't move forward very fast and the details were very in-depth.  Chapter 1 sets up the story with a grave being dug and a mystery man.  I was all set for a continuation of this.  But the next chapters were about the Dog Walking Club and their meetings in the dog park while one of the members is dying at home.<br /><br />The next several chapters were slow to read and didn't continue with the mystery man.  The next four chapters didn't get back to him.  The story just didn't hold my attention.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|L don't know if he really understood the \\"love story\\" behind it, but he enjoyed watching it.  He thought it was funny and loved the music in it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What I love about this version of Angry Birds is the degree of difficulty.  Plenty of challenge built into the game.  Most were difficult yet not impossible to solve.  So far, my favorite of the Angry Bird games. Highly recommend
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead season 3... Great show, great price! I'll definitely buy the rest as they air! This is a great show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is all that will keep you entertained on boring days.for example,I was at my sister's band thing I brought my kindle and it felt like I was there for five minutes.like they say,time flies by when your having fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's lots of fun. Grandkids love  playing it. Like the new obstacles and mine part!! It is a very addictive game!
0765325950|5.0|Great wrap-up to this 20+ year saga. I was certainly satisfied by the end result and I hope there may be a future follow up book in the works.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works well with my tablet. Fun for the whole family! Would purchase from Amazon again for apps for my tablet
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great can't wait until season 3. As always Masterpiece theater delivers something you can get caught up in and enjoy.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I love this Kindle Fire case.  It fits perfectly with my Kindle Fire.  The case is very lightweight, but extremely protective.
B003B96AOW|4.0|The figure itself was amazing. But the base seemed to be slightly melted due to heat from warehouse or something that caused it to curve down. Which might be the reason why the figure leans on the back of the stands (brick walls) or it might be because the foot peg is not long enough to keep it standing straight. Other then the action figure not being able to stand on it's own stand correctly the joints on the figures are a little loose. But even So it was still very detailed and awesome to have. Although I am probably the only one or one of the few who have received a little defect on mines.
B003JHKORK|5.0|Amazon movie would not download to computer, I had to buy a copy from iTunes to get one I could download.<br />The movie was very good, my daughters and I enjoyed watching.
B00005T30L|5.0|If you have trouble seeing past colorful language, this movie might not be for you.<br /><br />I saw this on Sundance and am considering buying the DVD.  At first I thought Enid and Rebecca were just a couple of silly mean girls who enjoyed belittling other people - the old misery loves company story. But after watching it for a while it got under my skin.  I'm sure every guy who watched the movie fell in love with Enid even though Rebecca was more attractive.  Enid felt bad that she had messed with Seymour's life and felt she had to do something to make it better.  After using false pretenses to meet the guy, she volunteers to get him dates. She tells him that soon he will be up to his ears in pussy. However, later she becomes jealous and upset that he had not made a move on her.  Of course poor Seymour being 29 years her senior never thought he had a chance with her even though she was plain. Rebecca comes across as stuck up and callous.  She thinks Seymour is creepy.<br /><br />The ending was ambiguous.  Some believe the unscheduled empty bus to nowhere was symbolic of Enid's (supposed) suicide.  My first thought at the end was that the entire story was a figment of Seymour's imagination.  The ending shows Seymour in a session with his shrink who was anxious to get rid of him and Seymour's mother was waiting at the door and immediately ask him what he wanted for dinner.  That tells me that Seymour lived with his mother and was not all up there, certainly capable of dreaming all this up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this book - a funny and sad story at the same time.  Excellent read and look forward to the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple is without a  the bes the best sequel I've never I've never tried it as many more options then the first 1 cheat on cheat on shin ch cheat options.

B0068TL23G|4.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played.  Makes me think, and then tells me if there are shorter routes.  Highly recommended.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Anyone who has seen this wonderful classic Western would be happy to have a copy of it, especially in Blu-ray!  I enjoy seeing this movie at least once a year and now I can see it whenever I want.  The price was great...it would make a super gift to anyone who wants to own a classic movie!  Now, someone needs to make another classic Western!!!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Felt like I needed a cover for my Kindle Fire.  The color was perfect and easy to find in my book bag.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|At first I was skeptical about another superhero series, but it really rocks! Right from the beginning the story is engaging and I was hooked.  If you like action and a dark hero, you will like this show.
B003B02OOG|4.0|Very good read.  Easy to read large sections and not get bogged down.  Grisham writes with such description and feeling.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Ian McEwan is a great writer but this book bored me to tears.  I finish what I start so I gave it a shot and found this book to be flat, uninspiring and uninteresting.  I didn't care about the main character or the situation she was in because it was so...dull. Maybe next time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is too much fun.  The graphics are great and the skill level is easy to difficult.  One of my favorite games.
B004GTLFNW|3.0|the workouts need to be easier to follow. lots of great information.several easy to follow workouts would have been better.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is one of my favorite games.  Usually I play it several times daily.  Easy to see and enjoyable to play.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game a lot. you can do lots and you do not have to spend any money. I would recommend this game to any one who likes animals.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of my favorite games.  I really enjoy card games, and now I can take one with me wherever I go.
0743539133|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin consistently delivers exhaustively researched historical narrative in an engaging and dynamic fashion, extrapolating the context of the day to create an understanding of the character of the figures. The edition is well read.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|Very entertaining.  So true to life.  Bought it because I thought the cover looked interesting.  Not at all predictable.Thank you.
B0011Z77OK|5.0|I've been listening to RHCP for the last few years. This is the first time I got a compilation album, and needless to say -- this is a great collection of their song. The signature voice, bass, drum beats and riffs are at their very best. The album also contains two previously unreleased songs -- Fortune Faded and Save the Population, with the former being a typical RHCP jewel.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written.  The characters were very interesting and I love learning about the language of flowers.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book should be read by all who wish to learn about World War II and war in the Pacific.  One man's horrific account!<br />The story is told with great regard to decorum.  There is enough filth in the reality of war and in the waste of men and materials.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I always loved subway surfer and the new boards and add on are awesome and I'm doubley grateful because it doesn't delete all my progress anymore!! It's addictive and fun...
B009WO7NQO|2.0|This game only have a couple of  so Don`t but until later after it has been updated. The game is fun for until you beat it.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I bought this because of the beautiful song the boy sings.  I even researched the background of the movie.  It is for children but I enjoy it very much as an adult for my Christmas collection.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is very fun and is good for people who have creative minds.<br />Why not get this game? It`s full of fun.
B000SW4DXK|4.0|I loved the original but I thought they did a good job with this one.  The acting was great and the movie believable.  Had the video for a while and was upgrading to a DVD.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Great game but closes on me when I use the Save Me option. Always happens when I have 5000 or more coins or 3 gems. Please fix!
B000641D2Y|5.0|Bought as a gift to replace a video.  The person I gave it to loved this movie both for its comic effect and its music.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|But this book is and it is Jack Reacher at his best hard to put down and wanting more. Read it and meet the real man.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|I love this movie.  Had regular DVD but upgraded to Blue Ray once i bought a blue ray player for Christmas.  I play it quite alot.  Action is great and you feel like you are right &#34;in the screen.&#34;  I was on the &#34;edge of my seat&#34; watching some of the scenes, which I was surprised at since I had watched movei so many times.  This was my first Blue Ray once I got my Blue Ray player so I loved the colors, and the &#34;in your face&#34; kind of 3D action.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I enjoyed listening to her Disney music and really enjoyed Lemonade Mouth, which she was a part of.  I thought this would be fun for the kids to listen to, but I enjoy this more than they do!  She has a much more adult sound than many of the Disney artists, and though I like this from the Disney perspective (I love Disney music...so sue me...), I enjoy this as an adult as well.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Incredibly done documentary of one of F1's most naturally gifted drivers. No need for Hollywood to make a movie about his career and life and take their literary licenses. Captures the high's and low's of Senna's career beautifully. Well done!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was action packed from beginning to end!! Story line is<br />exhilarating, crazy cliff hanger, Can't wait for season 4!!
B00B0ND67K|5.0|From the 1st time I saw BSR, I have followed their story, and making of this long awaited CD. The wait was well worth it! A longtime Loggins fan, I am thrilled to say this CD stands on its own. The song writing, the harmonies, the music, are all outstanding. I haven't stopped listening, dancing, singing, since I purchased it. In other words, I love love love it!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This movie is AWESOME! We have watched it so many times! We laugh hysterically everytime we watch it. Would definitely recommend it to others.
1439199388|5.0|The Epidemic of Absence is a must read for every human.<br />Do you know the history of the guests you host? You should. Really. Background checks, please?  This book is a thriller as well as scientific book. And the story is taking place inside of you.  So you can't put the book down. You want to see what happens next. And there are hundreds of sources to prove that the thriller is a true story. It's science. And he makes you laugh.<br />Velasquez-Manoff is a brilliant writer who has managed to render the history of poop, guts and worms into a thrill-a- minute, page turning, funny tour de force where personal narrative, deep scholarship, poetic device and humor all acrobatically weave through the pages with aplomb. Ultimately, your world view is turned inside out and forever changed. We're all a little more than we thought we were.<br />For anyone who wants to know more about being a human body, learn about your roommate named Nature. Your gut (or main street prime real estate for communities of billions of critters) has squatters. An ancient relationship, their ancestors lived in your ancestors. The history of coexistence has crucial biochemical implications that are explored in this riveting book. Know your history. Know thyself. Know the history of what's inside of thyself. You won't be bored.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great! It's definitely worth buying. Great picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters were wonderfully portrayed and depicted.  I loved watching all three seasons and looking forward to watching the upcoming episodes on TV
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun mini games but the point system sucks. when u run out of coints u have to buy more, play games u already beat over n over, or do thier offers.
B009WJ1DNS|5.0|It took only seconds to go from sampling to purchasing to listening and enjoying. Thank you Amazon cloud. Hope to use again soon.
B005D81W5Q|5.0|Great movie. Rude, crude and so funny!  There are so many laugh out loud parts. Cameron Diaz is superb as is Jason Segal.  Never get tired of watching it.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|in Sept. they jacked up prices foe this ans other story games, in turn we were &quot;equal &quot; with apple players. that's. about as far as it has gone. for Christmas lots of people were getting cool shop items, not us amazon users. there has been 2 appliances released and I cant have them, but I can send parts for them and have a stock pile wishing to build with.<br />b4 we could never receive goal request help or be sent parts for things we couldn't have, this has changed and makes me upset. we didn't need a &quot; version&quot; to get appliances we got them once a month a new one. not anymore. free weekly updates, not always
B005I64U66|5.0|Another great movie. Jennifer Anniston is superb in this. So rude and crude at times but really funny! I have watched it several times as have my family too.
0345803485|4.0|Strong protagonist that keeps you reading.  More sex than normal in a read......this is indeed a fiction in my opinion!
B005J4TLO8|4.0|My sons love this movie. I thought it was a bit lame in places but overall, for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.
0345803493|4.0|Sex over powers the second story in the book as well but I do like the characters and the plot.
B0076XDGZ0|4.0|Totally different sound from Transatlantic, much more melodic and more Pop influenced.    I just can't get Infinite Fire out of my head (been there for days now)    Excellent musicianship.  Some of the songs are a bit uneven in the writing.    You should check out the YouTube video for Infinite Fire by Marc Papeghin, absolutely stunning [...]    Blue Ocean, Kayla, The Storm, and Infinite Fire are the highlight tracks for me.
B001GJ9G90|5.0|These two show that communication is the key....in more ways than one! by the end...it was a symphony of love!
B0010X8NF0|5.0|This movie is a fest for the eyes!  Done up in beautiful color and cinematography, it flows flawlessly and INTERESTINGLY to its climax.  The flawed characters, so well-known in Anderson's movies are endearing and memorable.  I watch it over and over just too see the beautiful scenery~
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Très bonne application,facile d'utilisation,précise et complète je la recommande elle donne vraiment tous les renseignements utiles et plus encore,il est rare que je sois aussi satisfaite par une application je ne lui ai trouvé aucun défaut bravo
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Kindle fire HD.  Not big on RC much of anything, but i gave it a &quot;whirl&quot; because I have a little boy who loves them. Worked my way through the first 4-5 levels and found them challenging enough to perfect to be entertaining for a while. I tried both gyro and joystick and personally found gyro to be easier, but that would be personal taste. Worth a download just to try it as FAOTD, if you like this kind of thing (simulators or R/C) I think you would enjoy it. Not partiularly fancy for graphics, but your focus is more on the mission than fancy pictures, and for that, the graphics are fine. IMHO.  :)
B006VKKAWQ|4.0|This item is double boxed to save the CD'S enclosed. There are 84 plus one included about Mr. Toscanini himself(bio).<br />If one can remember the Metropolitan Orchestra with host Milton Cross in the 40's and 50's ,then this music will take you back to that era. I can't tell if the CD'S were mixed and/or matched digitally,but if you have  a stereo system of recent vintage,you will truly enjoy this volume.<br />It includes all the major music masters of years ago. Truly a wise choice for people who love to be taken from their livingroom to a place that thrills the mind!
B004JN1CW4|2.0|it was very slow couldn't finish it worst of the three books if you want a great ending don't pick this
B002NXSRVG|3.0|Wanted to watch this movie before the second one comes out.  It's okay.  Cheesy at times but that's what entertainment is about.
B004OA6KIS|5.0|I enjoyed very much reading it on my Android phone.<br />I recommend this book for anyone interested in getting an insight into the life of prominent scientists.
B000007OTH|4.0|There can be few music lovers who do not know the Violin Concerto No.1 in g minor by Max Bruch. But, somewhat to the composer's frustration, this is almost the only composition of his that is heard regularly in the concert hall or over the airways - either now or even during his lifetime. But Bruch also composed three symphonies, three operas, choral music, and several pieces of chamber music. This double CD from Philips features the three symphonies plus four short works for violin and orchestra. The first and third symphonies are in the standard four movements while the second symphony, of similar length, is in three movements only. They are played on these discs by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra conducted by Kurt Masur. The soloist in the violin works is Salvatore Accardo. These are finely played and well recorded works - but perhaps these are not the most interesting symphonies composed during the Romantic period.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000069CT Bruch: Complete Violin Concertos / Scottish Fantasy]]
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The most enjoyable game.you think you have an own howrse.it makes a lot of fun amd it is great.enjoy yourself
B0000069CT|5.0|There can be few music lovers who do not know the Violin Concerto No.1 in g minor by Max Bruch. But, somewhat to the composer's frustration, this is almost the only composition of his that is heard regularly in the concert hall or over the airways - either now or even during his lifetime. But Bruch wrote three formal violin concertos as well as 3 symphonies and 3 operas, much choral music, and a few lovely pieces of chamber music. To anyone who knows and loves the Violin Concerto no.1, this Philips Double CD is a real gem. All three violin concertos are here. I referred to three `formal' violin concertos because the two other pieces on these CDs are quite like concertos. There is a three-movement Serenade and the more often heard Scottish Fantasy. Although Bruch never visited Scotland he was a lover of folk music and was inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott. This last work is in four movements, with an Introduction, and is based on a reworking of Scottish folk tunes. The pieces are played by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Kurt Masur. The violin soloist is the brilliant Italian violinist Salvatore Accardo, and he is accompanied by the harpist Elizabeth Unger as soloist in the Scottish Fantasy. This is certainly one of the best performances I have heard of the much recorded violin concerto in g minor.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000007OTH Bruch: The Complete Symphonies]]
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this calculator. It is basic but comes in handy. It does all the basic functions you may need to perform.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|its a good game but since I do not have facebook Acct I cant get free gems and limits the gamecocks
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun. Plenty of free levels. The only problem is that the hint button doesn't ask if you are sure you want the hint before it gives it to you. You only get 3 hints. Even if you reset the game, it doesn't reset the hints. I accidentally brushed the hint button on two different puzzles, but I didn't want to use the hint.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|&#34;And Then There Were None&#34; by Agatha Christie - Very satisfying to the Agatha Christie addict who is looking for something other than Marple or Poirot!
B00AYB20KI|5.0|I love a good suspense/horror movie and had heard mixed reviews on this one.  Nothing to get an Oscar over but really entertaining and &#34;didn't see that coming&#34; made it worthy of the extra star.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved this game because at the part where there is a tree root and you trip you get a 2nd chance and it's mostly like temple run 2 but your not in the sky I would buy it!!!(even if it was$100 I would buy it!!)
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Would recomend this CD to anyone. So much talent on one soundtrack! ...Tom Cruise's voice totally blew me away! Who knew?
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I loved the again but it won't automatically save when I get to the snow world other then that I loved it!
B009D0LBRO|3.0|This game was ok, definitely not what the original game was. Wish it had the ability to save your progress. Had to keep restarting levels. That eventually became tiring. Good graphics though!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved this game it has new features like a waterfall but sometimes if I swipe it won't work but other then that I love it!!!
B004GFN11A|5.0|I have recently became a blogger, hoping to get my name out there somehow, and this app was exactly what I needed. Small and convenient enough for me to whip my Kindle Fire out and start writing immediately. Just wish it had some of the perks that the website offered, such as the ability to publicize your content on Facebook, Twitter, etc. Hope that comes in an update soon...
1609611543|5.0|I had no idea how bad wheat was until I read the about how it is manufactured, and why it's bad for us. I haven't read mine from cover to cover yet but I know quite a few people who have bought this book and are seeing results.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game enough to use it as a short time waster but, I guess it's just not the kind of game I can get fully absorbed in trying to unlock all of the extras.  If you hate fruit I guess you'll like this game ^_^
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham has written much better but this book was interesting and kept me reading.  Not much else I can say.
098555780X|4.0|Purchased this for a special outdoors youth in our life. Makes a unique special gift! Quick shipment and no hassle!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book.  Martel kept my attention poised on every hour in that boat.  He really deserved the prize he won.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this collection, even though I already had the first two movies in hi-def, because it was only a couple of bucks more expensive than the Blu-ray of The Dark Knight Rises and actually had extra features for that movie.<br /><br />I felt at the end of this movie [The Dark Knight Rises] like I did when I first heard Beethoven's Opus 131. I was so overwhelmed at the mastery of the medium that I had just witnessed that I had a hard lump in my throat, tears on the edges of my eyes and several suddenly-caught breaths. When in the realm afforded us by such greatness, we are like angels discovering we have wings. &#34;Hey, I never knew I could fly like that! Thank you sir!&#34;
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It's hard to beat Pillar's of the Earth but this story came close.  The numerous interwoven stories kept me glued to this book.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Great story and message...great acting...creates the feel of the era very well and all the characters are believable and well portrayed. Highly recommended.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I just finished reading the way of kings and though I should start up the mistaken trilogy after. So happy I made that decision Mistborn and the world of Ashen are truly an honor to be a part of the magic is incredible and the attachment to the character is so real to the point this girl believes she's real while living in the mind of Brandon Sanderson. Please read this and the way of kings not for me but for you.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I have. The imagery is wonderful. The characters so easily to feel a connection with. Such a fantastic book I highly recommend.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Easy to read with enough interest to keep going back.<br />I would reccommend it to others. It was my first time with Kindle.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The movie quality is great and I really enjoy all the extras that come in the set. I had never pre-ordered a movie or set before but considering the price and service I will certainly do it again soon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love!!!!!!!!!! omg why are they telling me how many words I have to write in my review?  Ridiculous!  I do love walking dead tho
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Lost girl is even better with no commercials and blue-ray quality. I received my shipment fast and it was like brand new but at a used price.
0525478817|5.0|I bought this book and by the end of the first page I was caught. I read until I finished it within a couple of hours. It was by far one of the most beautiful books I've read in a long time. It was hilarious, touching, morbid, thought-provoking, and definitely a book I will no doubt re-read countless times. I recommend this to all, as a young cancer survivor myself (diagnosed at 8 years and currently 21), please read, you will NOT be disappointed. This book is moving and I love a book that changes me.
0575117931|5.0|A delicious Read!!! A can not put the book down kind of read! Totally engrossing and entertaining. Waiting anxiously for the next in the series!
B007RI56NY|4.0|Very nice songs on this album. I like it a lot.<br />They are both dance and listening songs. Nice selection.
0756405890|5.0|Very Wonderful! Can not wait to read &#34;The Wise Man&#34;s Fear&#34;. Very thought out  believable characters with a great story line.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow...could not put it down.  Wonderful story from all angles definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.  Wasn't ready for it to end :(
B009PU2SX8|4.0|This is such a great album and mix of music. Buy it and support his music, you won't regret it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was the most interesting and informative book I have read , it keeps you wondering and waiting for the next line. This will have you wondering about all your own thoughts and beliefs.
B00AWTSRZY|4.0|Loved Part 1 and this was just as good.  Thought it could have been a little bit longer but I will enjoy finishing all the bonus features as well.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Enjoying the game so far...really a great app to pass the time. Slow to load but enjoy the activities given...horse gets tired quite easily but I guess this eases you from getting too obsessed.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|Not a good story, lost interest very quickly. Can't be compared to the original, which actually was 'an original'. This was just a bunch of pretty people with good choreographed fight scenes.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|not my sort of book at all, but couldn't tell that until after i'd bought it...nasty, nasty, nasty, ugly, ugly
B005D63RQK|5.0|Just a masterpiece -- powerful, uncompromising, male, clever. Existential one in pure form. The most relevant issues of life are raised:  life crisis of a fifty-year-old intellectual, modern escapism, drug addiction, a self-identification problem, a cancer, the relations of spouses and different generations. What is good and what is bad? A talk about event interaction in life can be felt through all the series.<br />The philosophy of a self-made man who being a school chemistry teacher turns into a productive professional drug manufacturer is very controversial and concerns ethics issues. Watching \\"Breaking bad\\" is not just killing the time but going deep into thoughts of moral, human standards and social structure.<br />I guess I feel as a part of that movie and really share all their hardships with them lol
B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is a great program to use! I was worried about just starting a workout routine at 6 1/2 months, but this one was so easy to get into and was not too much for my pregnant body to handle. It gives me just the right amount of easy workout I was looking for.
0743270754|5.0|Author puts you at that time period like no-one else. You can't see the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34;  without reading this book.
1616614609|2.0|You need to read and read the instructions as many times is possible, to be able to understand what the game is all about, I tried to play with my wife and she couldn't understand it.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Good game graphics are really good it seems like it has some actual meaning to it helicopter has real flight pattern it is really enjoyable it actually feels like I am flying a helicopter in my room on Christmas morning thanks a lot developer you did great
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My husband and I enjoy the show... it is serious but with much humor and laughter.  Recommend to others to watch!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to start watching this show.  Give it a try, I think you'll enjoy it.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|What a beautiful voice.  I found myself playing somke of the same tracks over and over. Highly recommend to lovers of musicals...
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought the album because of the song Ho-Hey, but I absolutely love the whole thing. It's an awesome album and the tracks are great. Will be buying all albums from them in the future!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This 2nd gen game is soooo much better than the original or Brave even. Challenges, graphics, and game play is all-around highly improved and well worth the meagre $0.99 charged for the game. Highly recommended!
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Someone recommended these to me.  I liked the first one, but I'm not going to read the rest of the books.  Martin has a great style of writing and keeps you guessing, but I found myself feeling depressed and negative about humanity after reading for a while.  There was never any conclusion to the plot points; neither during the book nor at the end.  The most likable characters just seemed to amble along without any direction and were VERY likely to be killed off (not so bad if there was closure, but like I said, no conclusion to plot points).  A little dark and dreary for my tastes.  Someone told me that the TV show is great, though, and that it stays very close to the book.
B005LAIGLE|3.0|I was surprised. It was not as good a movie as I thought it would be. The action and the storyline did not really match.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I dont understand the rave reviews for this book. The character development was weak and the imagery pulled from Tim Burton movies. I groaned every time the author over used the word, &#34;unimaginable&#34;. I could if you would describe it.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|So happy I now have these shows to watch any time I want! They are even better the second time around.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|If all you know about Imagine Dragons is what you've heard on the radio you're in for a surprise. I was really surprised by the different sound coming from each song. Each song holds up on its own and could make a great single.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show never gets old. I watch them over and over again. I highly recommend this show to anyone. Yay
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was not one of my favorite Grisham novels. When I pick up one of John Grisham's novels, I expect a lot of intrigue and courtroom drama, which this book lacks. The book seems too long and seems to space out the action a little too much. The middle parts are my favorite and allude to an impressive finale, which never comes. I miss the Grisham of old!
B007OWRBJK|2.0|I didn't realize Pete was such a tortured soul. He made some  great music and maybe that's what it takes for some artists.<br />Still reading but slow going.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I did not know what to expect, but this movie was very enjoyable.  A pretty clever movie.  You will not be dissapointed.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Just like the game I play on the computer!  The adds are easy to skip and it is a lot of fun.
0345803493|2.0|Oh, brother, these two deserve each other.  She's a pathetic dork with no sense of her own self.....let alone any self confidence or will power.  And him? How did he ever go any where in business?? What a wimp
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story was compelling and exciting all the way through.  I had to keep reading as quickly as possible to see how this young girl could possibly finish the 'Hunger Games'...
0345803485|1.0|Oh, what to say.  It's like a primer on what not to do.  Young women should read this book as a cautionary tale.  Oh, sure, men like this exist.....but they end up abusing you.  You end up in the hospital.  B and d is fine......but obsession and total control?? No, that is dangerous and twisted.
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|I thought I was well informed.  I even spent much time on a farm growing up.  I had no idea the amount of genetically modified food that is out there now.  No wonder our children are maturing far too fast.  A must see for everyone, but especially parents.  Buy fresh, buy in season, buy local.  Don't buy the hype.
0345525558|3.0|filled with unbelievable (to me) horrors and redemptions.  I didn’t like it as I don’t like books that use sensationalism instead of life’s lessons usually doled out in a less dramatic fashion.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This was an exciting and thrilling series! Loved it more than the first season, and liked that I didn't need to know anything details about the first season to watch it, so I could enjoy it with my boyfriend who had not seen season 1. I wish, however, that Amazon would provide more of a discount for purchasing the entire season upfront.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Simple game, you control a mini helicopter. Its a cute game, fun for all ages. I only played it for less than a minute &amp; i love it already.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|we thought it went real slow in the beginning in seasin one....sometimes we stopped watching it altogether...then by mistake we started again, and now that we are in season two, it is very gripping and we cant wait to watch them all...looking forward to each episode~
1616614609|5.0|Android: Netrunner is a card game that has reinvigorated my love for deck building and the nuanced strategy that is a hallmark of the genre. As a Living Card Game, the purchase of a core set of cards followed by expansion sets will give a player every card available in the game, which puts players who do not have the money nor the desire to collect the cards necessary to build a competitve deck in a Trading Card game on a level playing field. Not only is this model more attractive to me than Magic: The Gathering's booster model, I also find the gameplay to be more rewarding and exciting than that of M:TG.<br /><br />The freeform aspect of each turn in Netrunner allows players a great amount of freedom when it comes to deciding how best to achieve their goals. Not only does this feel incredibly liberating compared to some of the more structured CGs on the market, it also has a very clear, concise set of rules that allows players to resolve disputes through a close reading of game terms and turn structure.<br /><br />If you or someone you know is interested in picking up a new, exciting card game (Designed by no less than the creator of Magic: The Gathering), I would highly recommend Android: Netrunner.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|season one was slow, season two really got exciting and season three is even better....great series!!! We would recommend this for anyone<br /><br />...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great. It's a child friendly version of Temple Run. There's so many great characters to choose from and all these powerups. Love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Since minute one, I've not been able to stop playing; the graphics are gorgeous! Most of the time playing has actually just been watching my horse in the paddock, lol. The only cons are the need to &quot;force stop&quot; and &quot;clear cache&quot; when the load screen won't load, and the ad pop-ups. But those are worth tolerating for such a gorgeous game. (Has been bribed by game to post a review, but speaketh the truth.)
B004UID2LC|1.0|Search and you'll find....however it fails to actually play a video. And if a video somehow manages to play, it suddenly stops and the app just dies.  Uninstalled after multiple letdowns.
B007SGM084|3.0|I have only read the first book of the series and I struggled getting through the end of that...it gets a little redundant
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the most amazing game I have ever played.it is so awesome the best part is it is easy then it kind of gets more clenging so I totally recomend it for all ages.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Bought as a gift, and he loves it.  I would recommend this as a gift for someone that is an avid Big Bang watcher.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was watching my nephew and he loves horses so it's perfect.if you like horses you can buy treats and gear.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Nice searcing engine when looking up a quick way for definitions, explanations and tid bits of any source of topics
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't know I just love this game and I urge u to get it<br />It's so fun all my friends play it as much as I do
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It started off slow but was intriguing enough to get the trilogy to see how Christians life plays out.  Would like if the price as a bit lower but would recommend to readers who are age appropriate and like this type of story line
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you don't download subway surfers you are missing out! When I started playing the game I couldn't stop playing it. You can get your own power ups, characters, boards, missions, daily challenges, etc. Anyways it is a MUST play game.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|A lot of fun and came in handy for my son and the rest of his 11 year old friends came over to play
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I love this game. It's very addictive. The two thing I don't like is that it's hard to press more than one key at a time and you have to buy half the songs separately.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Haven't used it as much as I thought.  I like taking pictures but would find myself using my smaller digital camera when going out
B00003CXCQ|4.0|The set would seam to be in order, however, it seams to me that most of my store bought platinum editions had variouse stickers on the outside film covering and that there was usually great heaps of bonus offer literature inside. The box, cover, and dvd's themselves are of good quality and if this is a forgery then it is of the highest quality. I somehow doubt any of my other Disney DVDs will notice the differance. I'm sold.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|Thought that there would be more variations of the weather areas provided in this app on my kindle.  Had a hard time loading when it was opened from my Kindle
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Without him it's just another action flick.  Jeremy Renner is fine but lacks the charm to create an unforgettable character.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|okay, didn't play it much, it seems playing the actual card game was more exciting as you can easily access it on your own table and not have to pass off the Kindle to play with another person or persons
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really fun!!!! Every addicting and easy to play. My kids love this game and we had to get another kindle to stop the fighting.
B00A757EFW|5.0|It was a fund game and a nice &#34;blast from the past&#34;  kept you on your toes and kept coming back for more!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I am already a big fan of Rod Stewart and it would be hard not to love anything he does.  Great CD of favorite Holiday music.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Hard to find different aspects of the facebook program ie: different postings from friends,etc or reading their posts since the screen is limited in size and you can't read as many postings at once....hard to go to your home screen as well, not a very good menu (if any at all) to go back to your own link.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book will give you helpful ways to start opening the lines of communication. I especially recommend it to shy or bashful people. One helpful hint was to put a time limit on an interaction. People may not reply to your desire to start a conversation, if they think they will be stuck talking to you all day. I liked the way the author suggested that he was on his way out of a shop, after finishing a salad and then he asked a question of another customer. Knowing that the conversation could be short, the customer was willing to enter into conversation. This advice alone is worth reading the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hubby and I are really enjoying this series. It is so well written and the characters are beautifully developed.  Everyone I know is enjoying this series.
B002C949AE|5.0|This book was shown to me by my professor and what a good book it is! I encourage everyone to read this book!
B00797MB0O|1.0|Just not what I would expect with the actors involved.  Not only was it boring and predictable, it was just bad!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  I could use more coins.  It keeps you occupied &amp; interested.  My grandchildren likes  playing it also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I say that when you play subway surfer you are a person who has a great sense of games!! Thank you Subway Surfer i cant read at night because i am too busy playing it
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Enjoyed the subject and the writing very much.  Will share this with a grandson when I get the chance to.
B008K8U13K|1.0|When ever i try to play it on my kindle fire hd it doesnt work... it says i have to download more content.... which i do....... once it gets to 50% it says an error accured.... pleez fix
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I am currently following simple workout videos online. It would be more convenient to have these video available offline. Hence I manage to watch and download this video on my kindle (using green arrow at the bottom).<br /><br />You can choose different resolution. Personally, I chose a low resolution (smaller file size).<br /><br />After downloading, they will ask you which App you want to use to open the video. I chose Personal Video App.<br /><br />Perfect. Now I can follow my online instructor whenever and wherever!
B002UZCJP2|4.0|I don't know if I'd ever even heard of this movie before I rented it last year. As I recall I was in a video store and saw a jacket for a sci-fi movie I wasn't familiar with; it sounded decent and that's the whole reason I picked it up. Man I'm glad I did. I'm a moderate ran of Bruce Willis's, but his performance here is excellent. He's not a tough guy, he's a vulnerable guy and that's probably why I like him better. It is a sci-fi movie but really it's more about a man's attempt to break out of the shell that keeps him (and society in general) a prisoner. His awakening and his continued attempts to reach his wife are the best parts of the film for me. I like Ving Rhames, but that whole story line is forgettable as far as I'm concerned. When I rented the movie I ended up watching it twice back to back, and while I don't really buy movies anymore I'm planning on buying this one. Highly recommended. :)
030746363X|5.0|Love this book. Takes a lot of confusion out of many tasks in life. Breaks things down into the easiest steps required to accomplish things
B000I9X67W|5.0|Love this movie - the music, the ritual, the struggle of friendship, etc. Teaches some ideals on respect, leadership, friendship and what it takes to make it to the top.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I would actually have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It was what we like to call a &#34;cute movie&#34;.  Worth watching, but not outstanding.
B003UESJDI|4.0|This is fairly typical &#34;absolutely bloody hilarious&#34; British humor (which means an American will barely crack a smile) but Gemma Arterton is so sin-sational that 90% of men will rate this highly.  Fans of Doc Martin will enjoy this and find it interesting, if not hilarious.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Like what I said greatest app ever. Its sooooo fun and non boring. My band teacher even like same with every one I know that is why I rated 5 stars.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|My daughter loves this game she plays it all day long. I give this game 5 thumbs up. Great game
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Been with this series since it started.  I was completely hooked since I saw the Pilot. Great drama, wonderful character development and the best lookin damn Zombies... EVER.....
B007R6X9IK|5.0|To be plain an simple, EVERYONE should stumble upon this album. The guys in Soulsavers and David Gahan have created an album that will sadly not be heard by many people. I have read quite a few complaints from Depeche Mode fans that the band has lost its touch and that we will never hear another Violator or Ultra. If these same people, just like me could find this album they could die happy. This is not a Depeche Mode album but it is so good it will have you believing that you just listened to one. This is coming from someone who's main musical staple is Black Metal. I don't care who you are or what you listen to, this album is good or better yet, great, music. Go to Youtube and check out any song on the album. I bet the kitchen sink you will be back here buying it. To the guys in Soulsavers and to David Gahan, THANK YOU!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. It is so easy to use and it does not crash or anything. Sometimes it is hard to like pictures though
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how you can layer the sounds and customize the volume for each one. My only thing is some of the sounds are kind of the same, like ocean. But it's all good still a 5 star rating :)
0060760710|5.0|This CD book was purchased to break the monotony of the rotation of children's music we listen to in the car...  My six-year-old daughter, my husband and I love the stories, Steven Fry's voices and the gentle, curious, innocent, very-very funny stories about Paddington in every chapter of this book.<br /><br />We've already listened to the 2-CD book over and again to the point that I thought I'd see if there was more! (for some reason I didn't find more than this book at the the original time of purchase)<br /><br />I have yet to receive, but have recently purchased (from Amazon) two other Paddington CD-books to add to the listening fun that Paddington has brought to our drive time...<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend :)
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I liked this product a lot, except for the absurdly long iCOOLgeeks advert you have to sit through during every start up.  The company promotion is overly self-indulgent and annoying.  We get it -- you're iCOOLgeeks.<br /><br />I like the story line and graphics and puzzles.  However, what the heck is going on with the ending?  I got to the end...I think.  Or there's more?  Or there's not?  Huh?  Bottom line:  I enjoyed the game a great deal until the very end when I felt like I'd been cheated.  Weird.
0321344758|3.0|This is a lot older than I originally thought it was, it makes me reluctant to use it says it was published in 2006 in the book, but 2005 on the amazon website. Make sure you look at the dates because the internet was wildly changed from 2005-2006. It was probably good for that time, but times have changed.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I was hesitant to rent a remake of a movie I enjoyed, but I was not disappointed by &#34;Total Recall&#34;. It is well written, well acted and has great computer graphics.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I love this character and as far as I am concerned I wish Mr. Connelly could turn out books with Harry as the detective at a faster rate.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very well written, educational, good mystery, good characters.  Great book.  I enjoyed each page I read.  The education was balanced with the story.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I love avast.  It works very well on my computer and have no trouble with the different virus attacks that occur.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My whole family plays this including myself, my husband, and 2 kids, ages 3 and 14. It is addicting and exciting.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Great writting, great story line, fantastic actors makes this a must watch show for any body we loves drama and action.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Everyone should know the great music this band has made.  Unfortunately, American radio plays crap and they play it over and over and over.  It's too bad corporations control every aspect of our lives, what we see, what we hear, what we read, etc.  Do yourself a favor and go outside the box a little and find some magic...like Porcupine Tree.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Love love love this series.Claire Daines and Damian Lewis are awesome, this is definitely worth watching! It's exciting and funny.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Every song on this CD is amazing.  Mikeal Akerfeldt's voice, guitar and writing are amazing.  Another band that never gets airplay in the U.S. so a lot of people are missing out on some of the best music available.
B00136JS12|5.0|Everything I expected. good quality mp3 and fast down load. Worth the money and time. Kudos to Amazon for having the items I want.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun and entertaining. a good time killer. :) its great. for kids to play. and very.  apporiate. for young children to use and play when they want to play with my wireless devices
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. Glad I downloaded it but you should make it easier to earn gems other than that it's a great game
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The book was okay, but I hardly recognized Jack Reacher.  Seems like he is getting old...and the plot was just so-so.  Read the old stuff first.
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I've been a Van fan from the very start. This new release doesn't break any new ground. In fact the sound is remininsent of some of Van's last studio releases.<br /><br />A nice tight jazz based band;again no breakouts like PeeWee Ellis,Leo Green or Richie Buckley. One blues number that Van could have played with John Lee Hooker,I found tiresome.<br />But,still and all I'm glad to have it.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I liked the movie somewhat because of it's sci-fi, time-loop nature. Very slow at first, and didn't really pick up much later. Not a lot of action as in other Bruce Willis movies, but the story plot was pretty good. Some of the dialogue was pretty lame, but it still worked. Basic time-loop story and how to break the loop so time is permanently altered.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I started on the comics, and was excited for the show. It's a good thing how they changed it up, so we don't know what's coming, but we know how things might end up.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is definitely my favorite game, worth every penny. I like how it looks like it's an older game, but appeals to this generation. My only complaint is that my brother has the new update on his iPod and has signs &amp; breeding &amp; armor, while I'm sitting here bored as heck waiting for the update.
B001P3SA8U|5.0|Adrien Brody was great, and I love all the music. Great movie, along the lines of La Bamba and Walk the Line.
044654146X|5.0|A first class look at what makes an economy flourish.  Our own leaders should take it to heart.  We would benefit greatly if we restored the desire to be creative innovative risk takers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Definitely harder than the original Temple run.  Fun way to pass the time and my 3 year old loves it too.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I love anything Tom Hardy is in,so I knew I wanted to see this movie. It didn't disappoint for the most part. I wish the climactic shoot-out would have been more climactic...but I thought that the actors were great and the movie was awesome.
B0026SCMNM|5.0|Very interesting story about the difference in facing life in America after being raised in a foreign country. A very love story too!
B003YBNREI|5.0|Like fine wine, they just get better with age! The music is amazing! The lyrics are heart melting. Turn it up and enjoy!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Too much of the music today is manufactured by other artists, for singers with special looks.  Mumford and Sons have a sound that is not manufactured, but sound much like they are the writers and they know how they want it to sound
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, it is so uplifting and refreshing.  A lot of bang for the buck.
1400067820|5.0|I'd never read Nicholas Nasseem Taleb's books before this one. His style is at once off the cuff, rambling, random, and yet brilliant in the way he brings ideas together from so many domains and across history. I love the ideas of Anti-fragile and how they can be applied to our personal lives, how companies and big organizations work, and other large-scale complex systems. Many rich insights!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, it is so uplifting and refreshing.  A lot of bang for the buck.
030758836X|3.0|I really liked this book until I got to the end.  It was fast paced and clever.  But the ending was very disappointing to say the least.  The author had something great and then wasted it when the end of the story came.  The ending was bad and totally unbelievable.  I was really disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I do love this version of Temple Run. I never play the other one anymore. I love this one's graphics, the fact that I can use powerups, etc. I really loved the &quot;Save Me&quot; aspect of the game. Except for the fact that now whenever I play the game, and die, I try to use one of the gems I collected and the game freezes and boots me out. When I enter back into the game I have negative 1 gem and I lost all the progress from before I died. Extremely annoying! Other than that it is a good game. I just hope for fixes of the small glitches.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was going to be a typical love story!  But it turned out to be so much more! Easy reading!  An emotional roller coaster!  You couldn't help fall in love with Holder!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Beautiful book...everyone should read this! Dr. Alexander does a masterful job of sharing his experience beyond this body and giving us all a much needed reminder that love is all.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I would give this app five stars, but iit crashes every time i use a save me; ending a high scoring game. Also, it freezes up in the middle of playing causing me to die! please fix!(: thankyou!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Funny sweet and cute ! Both my girls and boys liked it ! We streamlined it and it and it was great to our tv!
B0012EM5D8|4.0|This is a cute movie. Good message. Wanted to have in our animation library. Would like to see more classics discounted.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy spending time on this game! My niece loves playing it too! I have been looking for good games for young children and this was perfect!
B007PVHANM|5.0|seen the movie on net flicks; I like to have my own set so I can watch it every now and then
4789004546|5.0|Easy to understand which particles to use and why. Explains really well.<br />Has everything I need for Japanese 102 and the 200 level.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Reality of childhood abuse, personality disorders, teenage angst, small-town politics and family dynamics all combine into a someway confusing, but valuable read.  Found myself laughing and crying while reading and  then thinking about the characters days later.
B008X6N1OA|4.0|My daughter loves the first two movies so we picked up this one to complete her collection. While it is a good movie the story has changed with more focus on fighting amongst the two different herds. While the fighting isn't overly violent, our daughter just doesn't seem to enjoy this movie as much as the other two. I do think that it is a great value for the price, while it is the same movie, you do get four different versions of it.<br /><br />Shipped fast and packaged well.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I know it is on my Kindle Fire but how t use it is a mystery---hope I see some hint on line as to use.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|A little awkwad to manipulate but a very nice case although a bit pricy.  Allows for easy recharging while reading or when closed and not in use.  Good quality materials and would recommend highly if more reasonably priced.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|...and I'd love to see it, but I'll have to wait until it's available to buy as a DVD.  Five stars for expected content, one star for only being available as a download.  Hint hint hint...
B009NPK1IO|4.0|The final season of Gossip Girl. It's not as many episodes as most of the seasons, but it was good! Easy to watch through the app on my wii :)
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a cute story with great visuals and it's not 'too young' for older kids. Adam Sandler and the whole cast was great!
B001B6K2TG|5.0|Seriously a great album. Wynton Marsalis sounds incredible. I think it's a great CD to own. You should buy it!!
030758836X|5.0|Great twists. Diabolical to the end. Very well written and shows how maddening  a marriage can be if you really care.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its such an awsome game to play and i love how it teaches you to run from a cop!:) JK
0446580848|5.0|Great plot. Good humor. The author moves forward with the hero and his very smart wife. It is like reading a current events headline.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great movie for kids.  Adam Sandler is wonderful!  Glad we bought it as we will watch it again and again.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|This was a good read but I would like to have a better idea of the Greek and Roman myth then I would be able to get the different references being made
0316017922|4.0|There are a few concepts (Such as 20,000 hours to mastery.  Talent is not enough.)  that are quite useful, but benefited scantly from the padding and personal embellishments that doubled the necessary length.
B003JTHXN6|4.0|I was assigned to read this book for a mobile marketing class and it instantly caught my interest. It is about the CEO of Zappos and how he started out his career. From being all about making money at a young age, Tony transforms into a community based individual who values passion over all things. He almost gives up everything for Zappos and along the way created a company that excels in corporate culture. Tons of good business lessons and examples of how to run a good business.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Good quality product.  Cheaper than going to see the movie. Not something that i am going to try to be a critic about.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its great.....new...and exciting! I love playing it! It is so different from the first on that it is even more addicting. I am so glad I purchased it. It was well worth it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you have any personal knowledge of this time frame, you will be personally moved by the book.  I literally could not put it down, especially when I reached &#34;The Day&#34;.  It is fun, it is emotional, and it is well-worth your time.
B008NW67E0|5.0|To my ears this band is unique in a very positive way.  I purchased this cd based on 1 song I was hearing on the radio, which is I Will Wait.  This led me to the album where I listened to previews of the rest of the music on it.  SOLD.  They have a sound that gets into your head and you can hear every every element to the music.  The lyrics, the music..... I can sit back with eyes closed and really get lost in it.  Kind of gentle in places, and then takes off and takes you with it.<br />I'm looking to get more of their music and I would recommend that anyone, no matter your style in music, will appreciate the way these guys jam.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star because when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking of it. It litterally captured me from the first word. I highly recommended this book to several friends and they have all loved it as well.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|ThatGameCompany is an amazing company developing games that are more of an experience than simple games. These aren't games you get hooked on and play non-stop for hours on end/your whole life (WoW, Mario, Halo, etc). These are games you play at the end of long/bad/stressful/chaotic day to TRULY unwind. These games require very little thought to function (and trust me, I mean that in a really good way), allowing you to get lost in the visuals and music, both of which are UNBELIEVABLY beautiful. This is as close as video games get to providing a kind of zen-like meditation experience. I couldn't recommend them more.
1452110581|5.0|I bought this book as a present for a friend based upon the title. Because it's quite short, I read it before I gave it as a gift and fell in love with it.  It's very funny and well-observed.  And the poetry is really very good. You don't necessarily have to be a cat lover to like this book--you can also admire the writing skill of the poet. It's good humorous poetry.  I bought two more copies of the book to give to two other cat-loving friends.
1401225756|5.0|As someone attempting to break into the crazy and cool world of Neil Gaiman, this seemed like the logical next step after reading &#34;American Gods&#34; last year (my introduction). To clarify, I knew pretty much nothing about this series starting it, and as of the time of this writing, the first volume is all I've read. Already I can feel this huge, majestic world being unveiled. The artwork is, to put it lightly, astounding. I particularly recommend the remastered edition for newbies because of the depth it adds (based on the few bits of the original artwork I've seen, though I'm not trying to bash it). The drawings, story and characters all seem to leap off the pages and I can't wait to read more.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|American Horror Story Season 2 was good and kept you wanting to see more... I was happy to be able to watch it on Amazon Instant Video. I did not feel this season was as good as the first season.
B0053O89IS|4.0|The Episodes kept the quality that all the other Seasons had--and Booth & Brennan kept the pace & excitement<br />up even with the addition of Baby Christine--I look foreward to the next Season--and the Solving of the Problem with Brennan being Framed--WELL DONE TO ALL--!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm pretty sure Jillian Michaels is trying to kill me with this video, but it works. The timing between the different exercises is perfect, just about when I'm over it she changes the exercise. It falls in the just right category length wise, making it easy to slip into a hectic schedule.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Needs to be read twice, particularly the second part of the book. the concept is really good and explained in a lucid way.
B0016MZFXS|1.0|This clock is a P.O.S.  It is impossible to set the time and alarm, and the display screen is so small and not illuminated.  The only cool thing about it is when the alarm goes off, the time is displayed on the ceiling.  Not brightly, however because in the morning, the room is somewhat light, so you can't really see it.<br /><br />We got this for our son for Christmas, and it is already broken (the arm), and it is early February.<br />Waste of $ in my opinion.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Book is just ok.  Not John's best.  I want to go back to Clanton Mississippi for old time sake.....<br />Slushman
B007TNS6JI|4.0|The only thing that I have a problem with is the game lags some and every now and then they jip me on daily rewards
B004AUNSX2|5.0|This was sit on the edge kind of movie. I did not realize that it was based on a true story. Held your interest all the way
B00992CF6W|5.0|it works great but the newest update(0.6.1) I cant get it for some reason. I have minecraft on my kindle fire but I cant get the update. please fix
B00APJLFEG|5.0|great movie for my seven year old grandson. the story was cute and he really liked the music and the crazy monsters
B004EC5IUW|4.0|great movie<br />i love the addition of mari and new evas<br />Overall i think this movie is worth the 17 dollars plus thhere is free 2 day shipping
0385536828|5.0|A kind of espionage-fairy tale! It's a play-within-a-play. It's As You Like It. All these funny layers and oblique references. How novel this charming novel is. A young woman is recruited into the British secret service by her older professor lover, who is the only one to die - a normal death. The book ought to come with a disclaimer: no characters were harmed in any way during the making of this novel. The bad guy reminds me of Malvolio, though his name is Max.<br /><br />She \\"runs\\" a writer who is secretly funded by a government-sanctioned though clandestine operation whose mission to create and spread a kind of cultural literary disinformation and thus influence public opinion. (Unlike Hollywood, it understands its intentions and results, though both can be dim sometimes.)<br /><br />She and the writer she works have an affair, fall in love, and both are disingenuous about their functions and purposes, also. They are like hit men married to each other - or are they the characters from The Getaway or The Thomas Crowne Affair?<br /><br />The writer's short stories are retells of some of McEwan's own. The books' narrative is actually the writer's narrative narrated by Sarah, his female protagonist. Got it yet? Hope I haven't spoiled it for you. So I say no more, but it's a delightful, intelligent read, after which you can respect yourself, unlike the literary shower you will need if you choose some of the other best-seller faux thrillers on the list.<br /><br />I did't feel sheepish after this, unlike the expensive cheap thrill of mediocre reads (Baldacci, current Bosch, Joe Reacher, that alphabet female detective series, that croissant-laden Canadiana detective series, etc.) that insomnia has caused me to purchase on my friendly Kindle.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|Cool movie<br />Pretty much a recap of the anime series. Nothing really new in this one except for a few images and story lines<br /> overall i would recemmend this movie if you plan on watching all 4 of the movies because it sets it up. the 2nd movie is where is changes a lot
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|TED kept us laughing the whole time. We could not believe this Teddy could take such center stage with humor. It mad our Saturday evening in quite enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is wonderful anyone who wants to know what it feels like to have a horse! Plus you can almost do everything with the horse as if you had a horse yourself.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Great Kubrick film!  Captures a timeless political stupidity.  I watched for the first time in years and was amazed again at how old it was but how relevant the ideas were.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The heroine in Snow White and the Huntsmen is a far cry from the comely, delicate Snow White of Disney’s fairytale fame. The modern version is a princess whose mother the queen dies, and father the King is seduced, betrayed and killed by the evil, now his queen, Ravenna. Still a mere child, the princess is imprisoned and after ten years escapes. The queen, will live forever if she takes the life of Snow White, so she dispatches the Huntsman, a wild-eyed trouble maker, to hunt the princess down. Upon finding her, he succumbs to her beauty and charm and teaches her the art of the sword. This is an action packed adventure, with a fine cast: Kristine Stewart and Charlize Theron.In the end Snow White regains her throne and the evil queen meets her sorry end.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|My husband is insane about Batman. Watched all the older movies. Watches the cartoons. I have no idea how many times he's watched Batman Begins. We finally sat down the other night and watch this one together. The acting was excellent from start to finish. I was pleasantly surprised at just how much I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I am in love with it and so are my cousins and nephews. This is a five-star game and it is really fun.I absolutely luv it so get it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game can occupy a bit of time while waiting for whatever one waits for throughout the day or night especially when you want a break from thinking.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Few books make me gasp out loud.  This one did!  Very surprising ending.  I enjoyed the different voices the author told the story through.  The main character is one you come to care about.  Great read!
1480285579|5.0|A great overview of life in Moscow in the 1990's from a teenager's perspective.  It gives insight into how political changes affected every area of life, and a greater understanding of why people accepted Communist dogmas and rejected religious beliefs.  Having experienced Russia first hand during part of that time period, I can attest to the accuracy of the observations. It's a great book to enjoy, but also to ponder regarding political implications on individual freedom.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|This price is out of this world!    First off it is replaced by the 910 then Nikon list price is $494.95.  Purchase at the advertised price and weep.    [...]    Note: I gave it 5 stars so that this review is one of the first, as a buyer beware.  (I am doing my own research to purchase a flash)
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|This book gives an amazing insight into the North Korean labour camps and tells the story of the first 'born in the camp' escapee.  How does someone who has known only pain, cruelty, starvation, endemic mistrust cope with the discovery of a world beyond and a thing called 'love'.  This is an epic journey, which still hasn't ended.  I found it riveting.  Blaine Harden is to be commended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really like this game better than temple run, no tilting or anything like that. So it's easy to play in the car, amuses the kids great.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan for many years.  This Star Trek season two is one of my favorites.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a fun game but there stuff is so much money it will take you a long time.But other than that I think it's an awesome game! You could stay on it for hours!
B000UBRT94|1.0|The music was uneven and the volumn was going in and out as I listened to it.  Really disappointing.  Poor quality recording.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Not very interesting at all. Badly written and overrated.<br />I will not buy the other two books in the serie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I completed all 4 of the levels in this Free edition in 3 days. The only reason I haven't purchased the Deluxe edition is because I'm afraid I may never stop playing it.
