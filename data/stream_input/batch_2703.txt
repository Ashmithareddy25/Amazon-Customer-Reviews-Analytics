B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great game! especially for people who luv ice age btw I have play for about 2 years and never had a problem!  :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got this for my 5 year old son to play. He loves the Temple run games and he loves the Minions(Cousins) so he is having a blast with this game.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|First off, I would like to thank Henry Cavil for stepping into the role of Superman. His presence & prowess has been noted in the film. I would like to think of Henry as our generation Christopher Reeve. Yes. A milestone indeed when you consider Reeve as the iconic Superman. I have been a big fan of \\"Superman\\" since growing up. I love \\"Man Of Steel\\" because they took a different approach to Superman's life. We never had an in depth look of Krypton. Most of my remembrance of that was readings from comics. Krypton and its people was explained & examined in such a way that led the movie from start to finish. I am a firm believer of needing a story before putting anything on film and everything else comes after. Not only that, but the comic fans will follow the movie closely. Pleasing them will not be easy because of previously failed attempts.<br /><br />The movie never disappointed me in any way. I actually like this version of Superman better because is more realistic. Especially, the debatable actions of what Superman did towards the end. It really showed how much compassion Superman has for his adopted planet. We all have to make hard choices at one time or another but like Kevin Costner said in the movie, \\"What you choose to be either bad or good will have a great effect on the planet.\\" Especially, with someone of his god like caliber. Having good parents is the root of having good kids. Whether if your an orphan, adopted, or an alien being from another planet. The rules still applies the same.<br /><br />As for the actions in this film. Wow! Especially, when watching on IMAX 3D. I had to go see it twice. It was that good! The scale of fight scenes magnified 100x times more than the likeness of Superman 2. Personally, I can't wait for the 2nd Man of Steel movie. Who will the next villain(s) be? Hopefully, with all the Easter Eggs I saw in the film I will eventually get to see the Justice League movie made. I am crossing my fingers! I definitely know that it will beat out the Avengers. The key is how will DC approach Wonder Woman? An iconic female super hero of all times. I believe she will pave the way for the Justice League.<br /><br />Wait & find out..:)
B002M9WW30|5.0|This was a father's day gift me and my dad sat down all day Saturday and Sunday and watched he entire collection.
B000002PCS|5.0|Somewhere in time is the music from the film Bid Time Return, 'Somewhere in Time', also the book Somewhere in Time.  A romantic novel that goes straight to the heart.  If anyone wishes to read it I highly recomend it.  Richard Reeves and Jane Seynour are the main characters in the film. Its about Richard Collier a playright who sees a photograph of a famous actress in her day from the last century and falls in love with her.  He wills himself to go back in time to be with her and the best thing they have in common is the music Racmaninoff on a theme of paganini a piano concerto, the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard.  You have to be a romantic to enjoy. I would love to hear Andrea Rieu play this music.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|First I LOVE her writing.......very compelling....didn't want to put the book down....read until all hours of the morning.<br />And the ADVENTURE of being in the wilderness...........coincidentally I was on a backpacking trip myself at the time.  Wish I had read it beforehand as I would still have my toenails maybe.....and being a woman alone.<br />And the ADVENTURE of HONESTY....that was the best part although the two were very closely related.<br />It will be a repeat read one day!!!!!
B003YCIE68|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie since I was a kid. I am so glad I finally have it on DVD.
B002ZL0QQU|5.0|This is a pretty silly movie, not Oscar material or anything like that, but just a good English comedy. Plus, every time I watch it I pick up on something new- a pun or little joke. I would definitely recommend this movie if you want a good laugh. Make sure to watch the twins, they're my favorite!
B00021R7CG|5.0|So this is how its going to be. The realism is scary,stories within stories,action, great acting, great movie. Didn't blink once. I bought this because I saw the movie when it first came out and always have wanted to see it again. I,m glad I did. I don,t know if i want to see it again to see what i may have missed this time or want to be scared again its like riding a roller coaster
B000002Q88|5.0|I bought this album and Power in cassette in 1991 for little or nothing at a dollar store.  I had been aware of Kansas since they first came out and Carry On and Dust in the Wind were favorites of mine from the '70's but after listening only once to Point of No Return which a relative of mine had, I never bought any albums because I just didn't like what I heard. I fell in love with ITSOT album from the first song; it remains my favorite. Ghosts is an underrated song which conveys the feeling of going to a long past historical site and feeling the impact of the history there. What too many reviewers miss is that this is also a concept album about World War I with the story going back and forth from a small town in Kansas which was wiped away by a massive flood to a soldier probably in Europe who is fatally in love with a woman back home. It reminded me that all Wars have their emotional casualties. I love all the songs and it led me to eventually buy all the Kansas albums. Unfortunately, the record label did not put out the resources to make this album sell. I feel it should be put into a musical with added other Kansas songs such as Icarius II and Hold On to name a few. Like one other reviewer said, it is Steve Walsh's crowning moment as a writer and the rest of the lineup is strong especially Steve Morse. I have always regretted Morse leaving as well as Kerry Livgren. Morse however is a journeyman musician was well as on of the great guitarists in rock history who loves to try different things.  One of my favorite Kansas moments is on No place like home where Ghosts and Rainmaker are combined for a rare, beautiful musical moment with Morse playing the guitar solo. Preacherman on Device-Rattle-Hum is also a great moment. I have grown to love all that is Kansas and hope they continue to do the great live concerts they do. Yet, ISPOT has a special place in my collection. To hear more songs from this album live, King Biscuit Hour presents Kansas is a must. I only regret that a DVD of the King Biscuit performance does not exist. ITSOT is a must for '80's rock historians.
B003K025TQ|1.0|This was a real disappointment to me. Very good recording and technically decent playing but extremely sterile and boring. Art needs passion, this lacks it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|After watching the first three TV seasons. I was left hanging and decide to read the book. So I brought myself a Kindle Fire HD and the four book bundle.<br /><br />The books are alway better because you get more detail and insight. But I'm sure that comes as no surprise to anyone who likes to read.<br /><br />I'm enjoying reading a game of thrones almost as much as I did reading Harry Potter and read the Harry Potter books over and over again.<br /><br />As far as my Kindle goes it's a great new toy and I'm always finding new things I can do with it, like having it read the story to me.<br /><br />Carl
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Love this game but there are problems on my kindle fire HD. The app won't keep an icon on my tablet. I have to go through the app store to even play this game. Does anyone else have this problem?
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I am a Die Hard fan and thought this movie was good. It opens up new possibilities for Father , Son, and Daughter sequels
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Horse game able to groom and feed pretty horses and 3d is good I like it a lot great graphic
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Not really &#34;ad-free&#34; as it continually pops up advertising for other game apps, most of which are not available for Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A great app and game I believe people should try it because you don't know what your missing until you try it for the first time
B001NHNG64|5.0|Very good book!  Could not put it down!  Can't wait to start reading the next one!  My new favorite character!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This movie was well written . The characters in the movie all have there own demons to deal with some more than others. One of the better adult films worth watching more than once.
B00CQV48MW|3.0|The best thing about this show is the star's physique.<br /><br />The sets and character costumes were too heavy handed. The script could have been much sharper.<br /><br />I like the idea of a hidden urban subculture of supernatural types, but the execution needs a lot of work.<br /><br />I found myself un-curious about what happens next.
B002361MLA|5.0|The book is life changing and fulfilling.  It feeds the soul!  It is a true guide to enlightenment and has the power of Peace.  I was moved, enlightened and peaceful the entire time reading the book. I would highly recommend it to all who are ready.  The book is deep and intense and extremely powerful for those ready to be lead forward in spirituality. I suppose if any critisism is required, it is quite repetitive.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book is awesome with a capital A you would love this book<br />So much it's a great book talking about.  Life of Greg Heaffly
1575666286|5.0|Excellent book on rebuilding the body's health. The body then fights the disease, whatever it is. It's a broken down, acidic body that enables disease to develop.  Return to REAL unadulterated food, and the body slowly returns to health.
B003VDZWAQ|3.0|Interesting concept. I have watched only one episode so far.<br />A couple of plot twists and minor characters help spice it up.<br /><br />The FBI agent grew on me. She did a good job (includes actor and support from script, set staff, director, etc.) of developing the character.<br /><br />I hope they expand the scope of this show, as continually dealing with the same types of problems experienced by the citizens of a self-contained small town will grow formulaic.<br />Maybe the show needs to grow beyond the limits of the book it is based on.
0062278096|1.0|If you have the \\"Sherlock Casebook,\\" skip buying this volume; it mostly repeats what is in the earlier publication, though there are some new photos and a few new additions (such as identifying Canon references). There are no new interviews with the cast as promised--all of those were in the Casebook. This is just an attempt to cash in on the popularity of a great series, rather than new and interesting material. If you don't have the Casebook, you'll enjoy this, and if you're a completist, I guess you will buy it, but really--it's a rip-off.
B0035V35P8|5.0|This exciting movie is filled with action and the graphics are great. The movie is easy to follow and fun to watch.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Jack the Giant Slayer is a movie about an ancient war between humans and a race of giants when Jack, a young farmhand fighting for a kingdom and the love of a princess, opens a gateway between the two worlds in this imaginative telling of the old tale.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I thought that the tale had a lot of imagination and potential but could have been so much more. First the good parts, the special effects were very good and the land of the giants was very well done. I thought Bill Nighty who played the giant Fallon did an excellent job at being the villain. But I thought the love story was not well done and felt a bit impersonal and could have been developed a little better. The other thing to me is that it seems that the violence and action in the movie was toned down to the point of blandness. The movie title was changed from being a Giant Killer to a Giant Slayer and several action sequences seemed to have been cut up to avoid showing the giants eating the humans for example and things like that. I am assuming that they did it that way to make it more of a family oriented movie (with the PG rating) and that's not necessarily a bad thing but I felt that it detracted from the action of the story as the action sequences felt a bit choppy and uneven.<br /><br />With that being said, Jack the GS is a good family movie although maybe not for the youngest ages. Unfortunately that direction to make it a general audience movie made it less of an adult oriented movie that could have been better overall and probably would have done better in theaters. Ok to watch but not a memorable one.
B000HF2NTE|1.0|A good action flick can be amusing, trashy entertainment (See: Live Free or Die Hard).  But it helps to have a plot. Acting is also nice.  This was merely a bone thrown to Stallone's then-pal Brigitte Nielsen.  She tries.  And she does a pretty good &#34;terrified female in distress.&#34;  But there is simply no reason why a bunch of crazies start randomly axe-murdering people.  Just nonsense.  And Stallone's idea of acting here is to suck on a match stick throughout the movie.  Don't bother.
0425263924|2.0|Where were all these features that make a book interesting? It seemed like the book was one tone the whole way through and then in a ploy to make more money Day decided to leave the closing few chapters out and stretch them into a book 4. As into the story as I was in books 1 & 2, book 3 was a serious let down. Gideon and Eva still have tons of issues, he hasn't divulged any seriously interesting news, and who even cares about his drug addicted ex. Anyway, not worth reading in my opinion.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Really enjoy the online play, well worth the money, takes a little bit getting use to the controls.great graphics!!!  Some amazing players online!!
B008I34ZFW|1.0|Fooled by you tube write ups and trailer.Story line ,acting and effects bad.Wouldn't  recommend buying if they were giving it a for free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really fun, better than other games like it!! no problems so far, so no complaints!!!  I really like the missions they make it more interesting
B00005JLR8|5.0|This film draws you slowly and convincingly into a close, loving family and its unresolved pain from the past. You feel like you live their sorrows and triumphs with them. Utterly moved I first watched it again and then had a DVD sent to a friend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|As my title says too easy and needs more levels but a great little game for free. If they had a paid version with a hundred levels would definitely buy.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The writers and cast of The Big Bang Theory have the best thing going on TV.  We can't get enough of it.  The humor, wit, and charisma of the cast provides the successful chemistry to make this the best show ever.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I saw this after seeing monsters university in the theater - the two stories match up well and it's a great family film!
B00005QFE5|5.0|Don't even think about this movie if you're after a fast-paced drama. This is a slow, even plodding, deeply-felt story about family and what it means. It is a meditation on loyalty and duty and was a delightful surprise.
B004PZ4HC8|2.0|Okay I have read thousands of books in my lifetime and and this book is one of two I was unable to finish ( the other was Pride and Prejudice); I am very happy that the movie was nothing like the book, the stories were referenced but but not like how you read the book!  Maybe it had too much politics about the book I am not sure but what I do know is I did try several times to finish it and i was defeated! The seller described the book just as it came it was in great condition and I did prefer the cover over the new cover with the movie image on it! Seller was honest-book was well boring!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|She I first download the app it was great. Easy to use and NO ADS!! Now I don't like it as much. I still use it everyday. It's very accurate and handy on planning summer activities.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I had no idea about how bad wheat was for us.  I always wondered why my belly was so fat when I honestly don't eat badly.  After reading this book and essentially not eating wheat anymore my big belly is honestly so much smaller.  It's not easy being wheat free but you can do it.  Essentially I eat out a lot and eat a lot of Asian food with rice.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|this game is amazing its fun fast and so addictive its one of the best games ive played in a long time
B005YDLJ76|1.0|All she is is JUST AVERAGE. A big money entertainer propped by heavy promotion by big money record labels and entertainment conglomerates. Although, i have zero interest in her average-ass, generic music, i wouldn't mind seeing nude pictures or video of her-to view her best \\"ass-sets\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It was hard but not to hard to figure out. I really  like d playing it. I will tell my friends.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|This is a great book and it is so informative.  If you don't know about the Gerson Therapy you need to learn about it.  After reading this book I am now an avid juicer.  I don't have the $2000 juicer recommended for cancer patients as stated in the book.  But I do have a nice $300 juicer for my use.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever! Ive been around horses and think this is very well made and has been expertly thought out.
B000M5AJQI|4.0|I won't waste much of your time extolling the virtues of this film b/c if you've seen it, anything I would have to say is just repeating what you already know. I will, however, provide a fair warning for those wanting to purchase the blu-ray version of this film: if you have the [[ASIN:B000M5AJQS The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and you care more about special features than a minor picture quality upgrade, just keep your DVD copy. I say this b/c the blu-ray version notably excludes the feature lenth TCM profile Scorsese on Scorsese, which is a movie length bonus feature about Scorsese's career, with him in the driver's seat of chronicling it. When I noticed this feature wasn't included on the blu-ray special features section, I wondered why they included all of the other bonus features except for that one so I did a little online research and found out that in order to fit everything on one blu-ray disc at full HD capacity, they decided to exclude that feature. I was a bit surprised that the online reviewers who provided that information said that wasn't a deal breaker if you wanted to upgrade to the blu-ray version and I would tend to agree, only if you plan on keeping the 2 disc DVD version and you get the blu-ray cheap. In my personal opinion, I would just stay with the 2 disc special edition on DVD if you already have it and it's in good shape but if you just have the basic 1 disc version or you don't have it at all, then the blu-ray purchase is certainly worthwhile. Also, don't be fooled by the blu-ray steelbook editions, as their features are exactly the same as the basic blu-ray release and one less than the 2 disc DVD. You're basically paying extra for the steelbook. One format or the other, though, you must own this movie!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I loved this book but I wish John and Savannah would have gotten married. They seemed so perfect for each other but I guess it's gonna have to end somehow. It was still an awesome book.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Suspenseful, scary, ghosts, a creepy house...what's not to love? Really interesting at first you can't decide who is a ghost and who isn't. Kinda upsetting that the whole family dies in the end because the cast is so great. But this show definitely deserves a 5 star review! *****!
B008VO3PA4|3.0|This is a easy read and a fun read. The pictures are great. Now I know why my cat is the way he is and all the time I thought he was crazy but I guess that's me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like subway surfer and the minions then this is the game for you, it has the same premises as subway surfer but more comical and the boards are much more elaborate. Great entertainment for you and your kids.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its fun if u like fantasy wish land games but there are some down falls as n all games its fun for real
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Does what it says and it seems as bright as the phone flash allows. Not much more to add. Ok
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Consider what the real background of the movie is...truth, to legend, to fable...It's a Hollywood update, but the overall premiss is the same...
B005ZC0SYQ|4.0|Its a good movie! By far the best Crow movie made. The other ones are just a bit disappointing compared to this one.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The characters of the show manage to engage you in their lives. Not a deep show, but fun and entertaining. The writing is smart, and the repartee between actors is well executed. In general, the acting is excellent. The character Louis is outstanding in getting you to hate, pity, and like him. The main characters Harvey and Mike have excellent chemistry -- Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid style.  Female characters are portrayed as strong and equal to the battle within in this fictional high-end law firm setting.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Wish there was more programming like this on TV today.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|It was good it was amazing.it was well created and wonderful.it was like what what will happen next good book
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|A movie that the whole family can enjoy after watching it many, many times...I recommend it to all folks...a really fun ride...!
0307887448|5.0|After video game designer James Halliday dies, there is a world wide contest held to obtain his company and fortune.  Our protagonist, Wade Watts otherwise known as Parzival is on the quest to find Halliday's Egg, when his aunt's home is blown up and killed.  Parzival must go on the run while also being the first to win the contest.<br /><br />The story takes place in a near future world of 2044 were everyone &#34;Jacks&#34; into a virtual world called &#34;The OASIS&#34; to Learn, Work, and Play.  Meanwhile the real world is falling apart by pollution and poverty.<br /><br />I love the references to the 80s, classic arcade games, music, and movies throughout the book.  It holds your attention.  I really had a hard time putting it down, wanting to see what happens next.  The puzzles within the story makes you think along side the characters.<br /><br />It is one of the few books I've read multiple times, and it is just as good if not better each new time of reading it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book as i said in the title but the movie is better so if you have the movie i would recommend watching that first.
B004SRWW0C|3.0|I don't like it as much as es file explorer which does have root explorer option. Just not worth 4 dollars. Don't buy. Get es file explorer.
B00CFA222M|5.0|It is very interesting and could give clues to the ancient Annanuki who inhabited the earth many mellinia ago...It goes from truth, to legend, to fable...Only a knowledgeable person would be interested...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very fun and well it would be better if there were more vehicles to use thank you!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a great, heavy duty wire that fits my Kindle HD snugly and securely. I also like the 5' length. It makes for some extra slack so the wire to Kindle connection isn't strained.  I really believe in using a product made specifically for another and this one fits the bill.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is a fun app to use especially when I just have a few minutes to spare.  This game is easy to learn.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|What an outstanding message. A pure and wholesome movie for people of any age. A perfect reminder of what parents, (not just dads) need to know and do. Truly the world would be a better place if more parents patterned their lives like these characters.
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|The album is a collection of fine songs. Of course the title track is very good, and there are some other possibly radio-worth songs, but nothing really jumps out at you. Worth a pickup if you are a fan of the band.
B004NS710C|5.0|Just love this movie  Really like real live stories and this one is exciting, keeps you on the edge of your chair, tender, and has humor  all rolled into one  buy it and you will love it too.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Joe keeps making great music, I have everything he has ever put out I would rate this high with the others its a must have
B007B6VOG0|3.0|Three very strong tracks, and the rest is pretty strange. After Some Nights, We Are Young, and Carry On, the album gets experimental, outlandish, and floats from style to style without cohesion. Those three tracks are worth the album purchase though.
B0001I561E|1.0|The discs and box looked like they were in great condition, but the movies skips for the entire ending :( I know it was &#34;used&#34; but the description said good condition.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|Before this album i had never heard of John Mayer.. I was in Iraq working for KBR LOGCAP as an contractor and i heard Gravity come over the radio. The song had me hooked.. especially since i was going through a really difficult time in my life. That one song seemed to draw me in ... so i went and bought his album Continuum... and MAN!!! Once i heard that album.. it was like... i can't explain... like my eyes had been opened to looking at life, myself, my accomplishments and failures so different. So because of how good this album was, i went and bought all of his albums prior.. and OMG!! I was hooked!! I kid you not, for almost 3 years after that all i ever listened to was John Mayer, Before him all i listened to was rap music and r&b, but because of John and the substance of his music i haven't been back to rap or R&b too much since... He makes Life Music... and his optimism and honesty and gifted voice and guitar playing has been the soundtrack to my life. GREAT GREAT LIFE CHANGING ALBUM!! I LOVE YOU JOHN!@ NO HOMO!! lol
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game presents a challenge and allows the player to develop enhanced observational skills.  I find that it provides an interesting level of difficulty without causing stress.
014241543X|3.0|This is a good book, I think. I mean, I can't be certain since I was missing over 60 pages. The concept was very good and interesting. It made for a fast read -- especially when my book just left out a bunch of pages.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game is dumb it is annoying and  I hate it  you can't even do the hairstyle that you want
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Great story line even if a bit predictable. Tom Cruise as the anti-Hero bad who is really the good guy is a different twist. Didn't do well at the box office but if you are looking for a guy movie it doesn't disappoint.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey just keeps getting better.  They continue to follow the same characters lives.  They do seem to progress through quite a bit of ground in this series as the story seems to take place over the span of several years.  Love the actors and the storyline, so waiting anxiously for series 4 to begin to air in US.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|This film had some humorous moments. It had some touching moments. This was by far one of Cameron's most entertaining. A 1 time watch for me.  Not something I would add to my library.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I played the first ten levels in an hour or two. it is really a fun game. I look forward to more levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so much fun because when I'm bord I play my friends and I race each other to see who's the best at subway surffer and I ail most of the time
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just on chapter 3 but so far my 9 year old son and myself are hooked together. Great quality time for us. Enjoying both our time together and this game. Can't wait to start next chapter.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids this game and the graphics are just amazing.<br />I love this app. I can't put it down. I have  in on my phone too.
B00000G3PL|5.0|Enjoy these movies!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Every time I read this author he fails to disappoint me.  Simply an epic story with many plots that seem to come together at the end.  Brandon writes great characters.  You either love them or hate them.  The only thing I hate now is that I thought the whole trilogy was out, but apparently the next two books are still in development.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LIKE THIS APP very much. It' s works very well. Every time I used.  The app it helps me keep my math together.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Great movie, as expected!
B002R88G5E|5.0|This author gets better and better. This explores the cruel life of Afghanistan women and is very sad in part, but never boring. Really makes you think about a country that we don't know much about. Such a hard life for the heroine, but a hopeful ending that things will improve.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Bought this just before a long car-trip and didn't have time to read the manual.  Was really easy to figure out; match-up an FM channel, put MP3s onto a flash drive, plug it in the cigarette lighter and you are listening to your music!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love Harry Potter!  So do the grandkids!
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|Good story with thought provoking ideas. Good resolution in the end. The glossary of flower meanings at the end is very good.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What's not to like. Beautiful clothes, a wonderful setting and characters you love or hate. Can't wait for the next installment.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like having a calculator for the kindle. this has nice features and is easy to read. the memory in the calculator helps keep track of where I was.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is just like temple run ,subway surfers,it's fun but hard I can't tell you how hard it is for me to win
0061950726|5.0|Fascinating story.  I thought it was well written and based on historical events.  Interesting interaction between the two main characters who needed each other.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Well written history of this terrible disease, with touching anecdotes, serious scientific descriptions and a deep historical narrative. A must read for someone who has been touched, directly or indirectly, by this scourge
B0093FNZT6|3.0|An interesting book on a mysterious topic that has fascinated me for many years. The author's occupation and that of his son adds credibility to the story (neurosurgeons).<br /><br />The story confirms my own faith in an afterlife in heaven.<br /><br />I wonder, though, whether the near death experience is no different to the ad hoc, crazy dreams most of us have each night?<br /><br />In any event, it's nice to know that near death experiences can occur just prior to death, and while I am not going to rush it, I feel more relaxed about my own future death having read the book.
B0010T56J0|2.0|Geoffrey Rush was superb as the broken psychologically distraught pianist David Helfgott. His performance is rich in humanity and pathos.No one has been more deserving of their best Actor Academy award. The music is absorbing and drives the story line of psychological friability and finalredemption. Unfortunately, interrupted playback really disrupted being lost in the wonderful story.
B00542USJW|5.0|Looney Toons and Michael Jordan - need I say more?
B0094K1WZE|3.0|It was a fun movie to watch as long as you don't expect too many twists in the plot line.
0385344333|1.0|I have read every single one of Lee Child's novels and this is, without a doubt, the worst Reacher book I have read. The plot was so convoluted and it ultimately ended with a huge disappointment and a contrived ending that seriously lacked detail and specifics that may have somewhat salvaged it. I'm not sure where Lee Child will take us next because the formula of Reacher going to a different city with his toothbrush, disposable clothes and taking on the bad guys is getting rather tedious. How many times can you do the same story with a different variation in a different city? I may have to take a break from this author until he comes up with some new material because his latest book was a failure. I had to force myself to finish it. For now I will stick with Brad Thor, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, David Baldacci, Jeffrey Deaver, et al and avoid Lee Child. And Tom Cruise cast as Reacher is a complete joke. Don't they have any big, manly men in Hollywood anymore? I guess not.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is a great twist on the jewel games, but a lot more enjoyable.  I like that your matches do damage toyour foes and the amount of damage is based on the number of items you match.  More items, more damage.  I also like that you can purchase items for strength, or if you like a challenge, you can do battle with out the upgrades.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This novel isn't for the casual reader, but for someone who wants a novel that burrows into the brain and takes root in your heart and mind.  A complex tale of loss, love and redemption, told against the backdrop of North Korea's oppressive regime, this is a novel destined to become a classic.
B004NELBPC|5.0|The front page is very informative and attractively presented, providing a concise summary of the most important stories of the day.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I really like this game.  Reminds me of how much fun I had playing Galaga, but updated.  My only concern is when playing in the daylight it is difficult to see the action on the screen.  Best played at night or indoors.
B00422LESO|5.0|Fun read that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Looking forward to the movie.  I hope it comes to my little town or nearby.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|It really makes you put your mind to work in finding the clues and finding how to  use them.  I also was really sweet how they allowed you to interact with the different rooms.
B003477DVK|5.0|This is a great movie. Our grandson named his dog skip after watching this movie as a small child, at 14 he still loves this movie, he watched it over the new batman!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Didn't really look into this game before I bought it, but it is pretty fun. Easy to play and win. Quite addictive after a while.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|The graphics are very well done and its so realistic especially on my ipad it works fine no bugs at all very fun to play and it never gets borring
B00DHNJCKQ|1.0|Poor script and poor cinematography... Colin is way below his level. The revenge plot was hardly impactful considering the director decided to let the cat out of the bag right in the middle of the movie... waste of money in theatre but okay to rent on amazon.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love these games. It is so hard to put them down. I would recommend this for anybody. Have to use your mind.
B00846REIS|3.0|I just couldn't believe how quickly they got serious. Ending was non existent. It just stopped.<br /><br />Kind of a shallow read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane revisited themes from Coraline and The Graveyard Book by conjuring a vast, terrible, lovely world to suck in the young protagonist. I don't think anyone is better at evoking how real and dangerous fantasy can be. Here, again, Gaiman knows just how much detail to give out and just when to stop.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Great product and a good price--a must have. I highly recommend this product. Never worry about protection for your Kindle Fire.
B0084670FU|2.0|The movie had multiple story lines that added little to the movie plot. The movie was an hour longer than it needed to be. Nothing special to mention.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this whole series. I have purchased every season available so far to catch up since I didn't watch it when the series first aired on TV. This show is absolutely hysterical!!! All the characters are so funny and work so well with each other. This has quickly become one of my favorite shows ever!!! And I'm happy that i got to watch most of the episodes one after another instead of waiting a week to see what comes next. If you haven't yet seen it, I definitely recommend this show!!!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|If you like Zombies or comedies:<br />If your into the whole Zombie concept, this movie is a must for you! This is a great movie that has romance for ladies, and comedy for the guys. There's not a lot of big gun battles killing zombies, but more of a daily life of a zombie thing. Its pretty funny and a must see. It does have a love story in it, but kind of pokes fun at the concept too, and at the zombie concept. Its a must watch for zombie lovers!<br /><br />If you  hate zombies:<br />I watched this with a friend who doesn't like zombie movies, and he said it was ok. He thought it was funny, but he doesn't like zombies. When I asked would you watch it again, he said probably not, but it was still worth watching at least once. He said it needed more people killing zombies, and less comedy.
B001QMCJ1Y|4.0|Fly Away Home is a coming-of-age story.  After her mother dies unexpectedly in a car accident, twelve-year-old Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) must leave New Zealand to live with her estranged father in Canada (Jeff Daniels).  Tom Alden is an artist and inventor, with a passion for flying.  Well, father and daughter get off to a bumpy start.  But then Amy finds some Canadian goose eggs.  She cares for them and soon has a flock of geese following her around as if she were their mother.  Father and daughter decide to teach the geese to migrate south for the winter.<br /><br />This movie features solid acting, beautiful photography and an outstanding score.  It is somewhat melodramatic, but not cheesy.  Anna Paquin shines in what was her first major film role, and Jeff Daniels shows that he can do more than comedic bits.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG for mild language and an accident scene.  Men are shown in their underwear in a couple of scenes, and there is an awkward scene in the bathroom after one character has taken a shower (nothing explicit).  The movie has a very strong pro-environmental theme throughout.  Some viewers will appreciate this; others might find it preachy.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer does justice to the beautiful scenery and musical score.  The outdoor scenes are particularly striking, while the indoor scenes vary in quality.  Some are noticeably grainy, while a couple are downright gritty.  Nevertheless, this is still a significant improvement on the DVD.  If you are considering an upgrade, I think it's worth it.<br /><br />Fly Away Home is an inspiring coming-of-age story.  I highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Every time I try to open this app, my Kindle freezes and I have to force shutdown. I do NOT recommend this app!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I credit this book with encouraging me to get off my behind and change my life.<br /><br />The War of Art is a brief guide on overcoming procrastination and laziness on your way to accomplishing your dreams. Steven Pressfield identifies the enemy of artists as Resistance, a nebulous force that saps your will and prevents you from doing the things that you want to. In a series of concise bullet points, Pressfield breaks down Resistance and why it is such an insidious and dangerous enemy. Overcoming Resistance is what separates amateurs from professionals. The final third of the book is dedicated to helping you cultivate the mindset to defeat Resistance once and for all. He gets weird near the end talking about the Greek Muses and whatnot, but his ideas work.<br /><br />If you've wanted to accomplish something great but've kept putting it off, I urge you to read The War of Art as soon as you can.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I read this book in preparation for a trip to Normandy.  It really added to the experience, which was very emotional.  Every American should be required to read this book or go to the American cemetery in France.  Many do not understand what sacrifices were made there.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is so cute ! and it downloads very fast. and I love the graphics, they are so real and beautiful.<br />I recommend this game for anyone who loves fish.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Action packed, keeps you entertained and wanting to see what comes next.  Like how all the heroes come together in one movie.  Will watch again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the greatest books I have ever read. Every line fits, every moment is perfect, and every punctuation mark has meaning. The characters are lovable and so unique. A must read.
1577312082|1.0|The voice was so hypnotic and monotone I had a hard time listening. I have a high IQ and am very into all these sorts of books/therapy/motivational audios and tools but this one was a bit too deep even for my intelligence. It could have been summed up in a single cd rather than 7 but I couldn't tolerate the set because I felt like I would fall asleep to his voice! Really!
1582406723|5.0|It's the first 6 or 7 The walking dead comics fit into this booklet.<br />They seller sent it to me in a normal bubble wrapped envelope so it came perfect.<br />Great book if your into zombies and apocalyptic stuff.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|the show is really good, good cast, good script. must see season 2, also there is only 2 seasons to this show which is the only disappointing thing.
B000FC2KL0|3.0|The book itself is good , he spends a portion of the book on his childhood and almost none on his future or his current life. But I was shocked when there were NO pics inside ,, I saw them in a physical copy in a book store, what a  Shame, what have been perfect otherwise.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is great to have all the weather info in one location. Easy to use &amp; user friendly. It did lock up my screen when I first opened it, but after shutting down &amp; restarting, it works fine.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag!  Plenty of room in the main section (deep, well-padded areas) and ample additional zipper compartments for additional accessories, i.e. filters, cleaning kit, Kindle/tablet, etc.  Also, has velcro straps to carry a tripod/unipod lengthwise on the side of the bag.  It's a great all-round backpack and I wouldn't necessarily limit it to just hauling around camera gear; very versatile.  I was impressed with how well this bag is constructed, and it has the optional shoulder/waist straps for close-fit to the body for field work or hiking so as not to flap as you walk.  Love it and would highly recommend.
B0002S947K|5.0|I was introduced to this artist about 10 years ago by an x-girlfriend. it was the best thing that came out of that relationship. LOVE this guys music
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun and the graphics are awesome! I would definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone.
0385342071|5.0|This was a really good read. I love the way Sophie spins her story. Makes you want to keep reading. It was the first of her books I read and do plan to read others.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I really really really think that you should get it. The game is so so so much fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cute<br /> entertaining. lots of stuff to do for being free. takes longer if you don't want to actually buy stuff. but fun
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Great product idea! Overall execution is not very good. I guess it depends on the quality of the camera on your phone. I have found it wasn't as useful for me.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|i LOVE this show. i usually dont keep up with tv shows but this one im totally addicted to!! cant wait for season 4!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It was a very fun game but it took very long to download, although it was worth the wait...I would highly recommend it to you only if you have patience
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I use this app all the time! Got it when it was FAOTD. If I were to choose to buy it at full price, I'd definitely purchase the full version! It's very stable so far. Just a quick note to everyone, remember when writing on a new document, remember to save your progress as hiccups with your phone or tablet may force close the app with extended use.
B009ZE27US|4.0|This app is so fun! Only flaw is the age calculations are out WAY of the park!!<br />So what I did was I went under the settings,which looks like a wheel, and typed in my custom answer ( ERROR!! Too OLD too CALCULATE!!)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|never give up! it's possible to escape just remember the answer is right in front of you! I was able to finish all the rooms!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I was waiting in line for a movie one night and decided to check what the new faotd app was and found it was this wonderful shooter! so i downloaded it to my phone and to my pleasant surprise, it was so fun! Kept playing until the seating for the movie and the screen told us to shut off the phone!
B003IDMUVS|4.0|Easy read when you want to put your feet up and let your mind relax - enough plot to keep you going.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Works great on my Asus transformer infinity. Very smooth graphics and looks awesome! Definitely recommend this to my friends and family!
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I have to say it was a good book, but it couldn't beat the first one. It was okay at the begining, but really got it's spark towards the end. I felt sorry for the characters. It was sad how each one of the chacters lives were falling apart. It's like every time Sam and Grace found a way to be together something always stands in the way. With this book I couldnt stop reading. In conclusion it was a great book. Complements to the author.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Got this app as FAOTD! Quite satisfied with it. Would be great if there was a print option with this to print out for record keeping.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is beautifully designed with smooth 3D animation, fun interactive gameplay, and a unique twist with the dinosaurs gives this game an edge over many other build-'n'-breed simulations. The ONLY thing I don't like is: in the tutorial, you are forced to use golden peanuts (time accelerators that are in limited quantities). I never give a 5 star rating, but this is as good as it gets!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a great game for kids and adults. if you are a fan of my little Pony, then you will defenitly enjoy this game!
B005T87QCI|4.0|I love the game it's fun and intense and I could play it all day. Problem is they only you the robots that aren't as good so when you get to the hard level you get pounded... So they say for 99&cent; you can get a better robot or make your own. If u do that it's more fun but it's a little annoying. Over all its an awesome game!!!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|So many channels with music for all tastes - I just think it is great to listen to whatever takes your fancy.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|He liked it and gave it a 4 out of five stars rating.  Not too bad coming from a little techy.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|The homewas an interesting mix of old opera singers. Some still condered prima donnas. Love came through in the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|He liked it and gave it a 4 out of five stars rating.  Not too bad coming from a little techy.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I loved this, my husband did not.Shows that older folks have complicated lives just like the young.But, we can work it out and find happiness.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|It's a rock record.  No, it's a psychedelic record.  No, it's a pop record.  No, it's all three.  It's one of their best, and I like it because it goes in several directions yet gels together as one great piece.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I like Boyle's voice. Maybe it had tooo much Donny Osmond on the CD. Did like the Micheal Crawford duet. I use it to go to sleep by.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is the best ninja game ever!! Love it! Recommended for you to get today!!  Slice your way through the best game ever!! Oh, btw, you won't beat my high score!!:)
B005UG542S|5.0|I have four boys that just love to watch harry potter.  will rent again from amazons digital download.  Thanks amazon
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The graphics are great. I like the app on the whole but it is quite slow and has got lots of ads. The movement in the app is not very good (as in the movement of the horse ). I think it's okay though and it wouldn't be my first choice of game when I go on my Kindle Fire.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm never disappointed in Nicholas Spark's books, he keeps you wondering about the outcome until the end.  The book is much better than the movie as too many details and scenes were left out in the movie.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|lol love this app I cant stop playing I mean its fun and a new adventure every time I play Wich is a lot!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An impeccable story of triumph, courage, and undeniable love. This story is one unparalleled by any other, and difficult to put down. Never have I loved a book so much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so fun! it is challenging but at the same time its easy. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who likes challenges.
B004SC8XHI|4.0|A pleasurable revisit to Abbey Road. Probably not the finest work from these 4 great Memphis musicians, but a good solid album nonetheless. Both this and George Benson's 'The Other Side of Abbey Road' have their moments but fall short in comparison to the original.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I am simultaneously encouraged by some of the success stories and resigned to the continued corruption and disregard for human life in Afghanistan.  I find this book apparently honestly portraying peoples foibles, but it is often hard to follow the jumps in time, place and person as the story goes on, leaving me wondering if it ever ends.  This may be due in part to my slow reading habit where I read but a few snatches at a time before I go to sleep at night.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I've been a big fan since her first release here in the States. Where the early albums had more of a jazz feel to them and featured a bit more of her piano (which I enjoy, personally) and the following were dominated by lush arrangements of standards and her distinctly sensual vocals which at times came dangerously close to being a caricature of her style, this album is a much different approach in song selection and instrumentation. I delayed buying this one just because of the departure from what we've come to expect from the lady, but after several listenings at different times I'm beginning to like more of the album. Probably just as 'The Girl In The Other Room' will never get as much play on my stereo as her other albums, this will get an occasional spin. I appreciate and understand the need for an artist to grow, but hope the next one will be closer to the groove we associate with her.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome! this game is like subway suffers but with boss battles fart guns and costumes! THANK U CREATERS!
B004SDEP38|5.0|Smooth sync to computer - although does require hard wire.  No data loss or format issues. worth the upload and install
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. I cannot wait for new levels to arrive. It is the right amount of difficulty for me.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Not sure how this affected my Main App.  but the main app works well.  Smooth sync to computer - although does require hard wire.  No data loss or format issues.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Its ok but wit ducks is u only get a certain amount of time and plus the stupid wolves are everywhere when I play it.
B00CL68BK2|1.0|Everyone raved about this movie, but we tried watching it the other night and the first 60 minutes just induces anxiety while watching. If you can make it through that, the latter hour isn't as bad, but is still pretty predictable overall. I just don't see what all the fuss was about.
1118156315|5.0|The shape and style of communication well with the language used is perfect for anyone wishing to pursue new business. excelent tool
1594202842|3.0|Another summer reading book.<br /><br />Very easy to read.  I admire Chua`s writing skill.<br /><br />However, I find her parenting philosophy in raising her 2 daughters far too exaggerating, definitely not a representation of the mainstream Chinese parenting style.<br /><br />I only enjoyed reading it as an inspiring novel.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Gran Torino is about a prejudiced old man stuck in all his ways who makes unlikely friends with his Asian neighbors, two teenage kids. When the kids are threatened by an Asian gang, the old man protects them in the only way he knows how, with a rifle he used in the war. Violence leads to more violence and in the end he sacrifices his own life to give his friends a chance at a normal life.<br /><br />Gran Torino is a fantastic story well told. It employs all three types of plots: an external journey to save the kids, a relationship development of the friendship between the old man and the Asian kids, and an internal arc of the oldman overcoming his prejudices. In the end, the old man does what would have been unthinkable for him at the beginning of the film: sacrifice his own life for his gooky neighbors.<br /><br />The themes of prejudice is echoed well in the supporting action in the film: Walt's ridicule of the good intentioned priest, the rejection of his own family and his war-bred nature to pull out a gun at the slightest possibility of provocation.<br /><br />My only beef of the film is that while it gives a strong platform for an ensemble of Asian actors, they are portrayed as fairly flat and undeveloped and some of their arcs are sacrificed for comedic relief. A check on IMDB reveals that the male Asian lead (Tao) has not had any other parts since this 2008 classic. That would be unthinkable for any other actor who played opposite the great Clint Eastwood. Alas, thank you Mr Eastwood for doing this much for the underrepresented nonetheless.<br /><br />To see the Story Chart of this movie, check out the Story Charts website at storycharts.ca.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Well I knew I was in for something, but never expected the shocking, disturbing and thought-provoking movie this turned out to be...I hope that this movie reaches parents in a way that roots, creeps through the body, and thoroughly moves them to think about what kind of responsibilities we, as parents, overlook.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I was looking for Skylanders Lost Island, but found this. I really enjoy seeing the dragons evolve. Enjoy very much!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|OK Tom Selleck is looking older...but, really love him in this series. WISH THERE WERE MORE! Watched a Jesse Stone segment while on a trip many years ago and enjoyed it.
B00DFFHUUA|4.0|This was worth watching and full of action. You cant beat G.I.Joe. Nice job with the marshal Arts. I think this was better than the first one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game and play it everyday, I only wish there were more daily credits or more opportunities to earn them. Other than that it's great
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy this series. Purchasing the entire Season 3 means you can view each episode at your leisure. Sorry to lose Matthew's character - he was a good balance to &#34;Lady Mary&#34;.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|If you lived in the 80's this movie will bring back memories and the idea that we could be a Goonie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watched the entire season in a few days. Maggie Smith is a wonder. Bring it on, season 4. Bring it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Just got latest update and i couldnt ask for more in a mmo for mobiles. Simply Awesome!!! My only gripe is the new lotto chat.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Always a good read in the summer. Anne Elliot is one of my favorite characters in fiction. She is true to herself even when persuaded.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 5 year old loves this game. She plays for hours and feels like she is really taking care of Beauty.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think just the point of making this game about the minions is so funny. If the minions make the the movie they sure do make the game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|had fun trying to solve the mysteries in the game. very challenging and fun thinking using numbers and objects. a must try for anyone wanting a challenge!!
B000UZPIAW|1.0|I thought this book would be full of juicy rock n' roll tales of hedonism.  Instead I got a book full of self-indulgent paranoid junkie boredom, complete with lyrical &#34;poems&#34; so bad and trite even a high school sopohmore emo kid would be embarrassed to scribble in a journal.<br /><br />Yawn!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This album is raw, unexpected, and challenging. The fact that listening to it makes so many listeners tense and uncomfortable speaks to the impact of Kanye's delivery and his portrayal of exasperation with society.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It's fascinating to read about Tesla's incredible contributions in the physics and engineering realm, and to see how far he was willing to go to insure his ideas were fully explored and shared with the world. Money was not an interest to this man. Everything to him, lied in the study of electrical systems and their significance.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|its good but i thought it was going to be like wirds with friends. like entering other peoples usernames and playing private games.. why does everything use facebook?!?!?!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was unable to put it down, only dry, tired. Eyes of  the older such as I must brakaway to rest  The Mockinjay kept me intregued  throughout th book.  Can we hope for a sequel?
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This one did not meet the expectations I had.  Video quality was not as good as we usually get with HD movies.  Some of the story<br />seemed a little too silly for me.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Keep writeing, a good book, but a little young for my taste.  I did read all three books and have recommended them to others.
B007THA4FI|4.0|While this book received mixed reviews from professional critics, it was an interesting view of English law. Language was a bit over the top and unnecessary. Perhaps it was the author's way of separating from children's books. I would recommend it.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|Truly an education in what makes our world and our nation run.  A good book, very interesting, I could not put it down.  It has opened my mind to many venues of reading material.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|In some ways it was very &#34;far fetched&#34; but in other ways, the drive of one person to achieve their goal can be amazing. I only wish I knew the country side better as many of the places visited were real and would be so much &#34;real&#34; to the reader having been there.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I have wanted this CD for so long, and finally just decided to get it! Bruno Mars has such a wonderful voice and his lyrics are so parallel to real life. How can you not like this guy?
B003K15IF8|5.0|This is an interesting insight into a person who goes way beyond what his life might have been. His shyness is his worst trait and his lack of self confidence holds him back, keeping him in his safety zone.  Too bad as he could have been brilliant.

B00CDUVDEC|5.0|I love this album man, it hasn't been taken out of my stereo since UPS dropped off on tues when it came out .I'm a little surprised at some of these reviews, I personally love this album ...its chaotic,heavy and dark. I crank this album at least 3 times a day. It's funny how everyone says \\" oh I loved his other bands but don't like this because it doesn't sound like those other bands of his I listen to \\" ..well not in those words but that's what I hear when someone makes a statement like that, well guess what? That's the whole idea, this was a solo project he wrote this to release some angst he's been clinging on to ...its not the new super joint or the new down so get over it .I love when I get a sense of the artist emotions when I listen to a album, its not overly polished or perfectly made, but that's what I love about it, its raw emotion ...anyways its SICK. I hope he does another one down the road ...ill certainly buy it if he does. To those of you who dig and understand this album for what it is ..enjoy my friends!

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really like this app but someone I know has it on their phone and there is more cars and I think all the cars should be open to all users. I &lt;3 this app!!!!!!:):):):):):)
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I have loved Dexter from the very first season.  It makes me sad to think that Season 8 will be his last.  Who knows how this series will end????
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It seems that Martin really hit his stride after the first book. As the series progresses the writing seems to get better, and I love the food descriptions!
1611761808|4.0|It was very interesting but it was hard to jump back and forth between the characters. He is a good writer.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Great movie and for all ages. 2nd time I watched it, it just does not get old.<br />Afterwards you really want to dive in a world of fairy tales and make you look at life with a bright light.<br /><br />Until the end the story line is well kept. Love it!
B006ISG9XA|4.0|I finally finished it.  Felt like I was reading War and Peace for a while! Worth it though.  If you are reading reviews because you have started the book and not sure if you have the heart to finish it, keep going. If you are reading reviews because you are thinking of buying this book, make sure you get the Annotated version.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I couldn't put this game down once I started!  Fun and challenging but not frustrating.  awesome way to pass the time and I likedit better than 100 floors.I
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I downloaded this app thinking that it would be a good adjunct to my kindle fire. It turned out to be a real hemorrhoid to use.
B0057O6IDW|5.0|This is an awesome movie by Lucio Fulci!<br /><br />The story: A family that moves froom New York to a new home in New England with a monster named Dr. Freudstein that's turning a home sweet home into a horrific hell on Earth!<br /><br />Dr. Freudstein is a monster who eats people to keep him alive.<br /><br />Bluray quality:<br />Picture quality: 5 out of 5<br />Audio quality 5 out of 5<br /><br />Languages: English DTS-HS Master Audio, Italian Mono<br /><br />Subtitles: English.

B00CL8D83U|3.0|So they're back, ladies and gentlemen!  PSB with their 12th studio album, \\"Electric,\\" being released a little over a year from their previous effort, \\"Elysium.\\"  Stuart Price produced this album, and if you're familiar with his work (a la Madonna's \\"Confessions\\"), you can hear his influence right away.<br /><br />With \\"Electric,\\" it seems as if the Pet Shop Boys are trying to really compete with the modern EDM/EBM/Dubstep movement, and I'm really not sure if they succeeded or not here.  This album appears to mark a completely new direction for the boys, but I think it came a little too late.  If it was released a couple of years earlier, THEN I think they would have had something really big on their hands.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's not a bad album, and I would say that it's definitely better than \\"Elysium.\\"  It just seems a little too clubby and electronic for my taste.  PSB were NEVER consistently like that, mind you.  Usually, they always had some sort of orchestral dance pop feel to most of their songs.  I can't find any of that in \\"Electric,\\" which is disappointing and deserving of a one-star deduction.  The orchestral dance pop which IS their signature sound has been replaced by those deep bass/club sounds characteristic of the modern electronic dance movement.  What I also can't find here is their signature social commentary and wit.  I find it to be completely absent here (unless they're trying to make a statement with Love Is A Bourgeois Construct).<br /><br />Anyone who gives this album a complete 5 stars is either a club fanatic or is a die-hard Pethead that would give the band 5 stars for anything they put out.<br /><br />And now for my track-by-track analysis:<br /><br />1.  AXIS - PSB's first single.  Pretty decent opening instrumental piece with minimal lyrics.  Reminds me of Giorgio Moroder a LOT, to the point where I almost believed that the PSB ripped off his style here.  In any event, this single makes for a great concert opening piece.  What's funny is that I feel that Axis really doesn't fit in with the rest of the album.  It's the most electronic piece without all the deep bass/hardcore club-hitting segments of the other tracks.<br /><br />2.  BOLSHY - Not a bad danceable track, I guess.  Almost reminds me of \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\".  Best part of the song is that driving bass beat at the 2:40 mark.  The rest of the track gets repetitious with that Bolshy, Bolshy, Bolshy-o...<br /><br />3.  LOVE IS A BOURGEOIS CONSTRUCT - This track definitely has a signature PSB anthem feel to it a la Go West.  That's really the best way to describe it.<br /><br />4.  FLUORESCENT - My personal favorite track on the whole album.  What a great beat to start it off, and I love how they end the song with the driving beat, too.  This is the track that can be left on repeat while you have the most hardcore sex of your life.  This fact is even more applicable to the gay community of listeners, which I'm sure they already know this by now.  As the PSB say, \\"At midnight, it's time for business.\\"  Makes sense to me!<br /><br />5.  INSIDE A DREAM - When I first saw the title to this track, it reminded me of \\"More Than A Dream\\" from their Yes album.  In fact, if you listen carefully to the beginning of the song, you can hear a background arrangement that sounds like it was used previously in More Than A Dream.  The song for the most part is ruined by those distorted outside vocals.  If they were completely removed, the song would be amazing.<br /><br />6.  THE LAST TO DIE - A Bruce Springsteen cover.  I never liked Springsteen, and hence, I just don't like this song.  Definitely skippable.<br /><br />7.  SHOUTING IN THE EVENING - The WORST track on the whole album and perhaps in the entire PSB canon.  It starts off GREAT, don't get me wrong, but then it just turns to garbage.  Clearly, they're trying to be like Skrillex here or whatever dubstep/industrial genre they're trying to espouse.  This track should always be on \\"SKIP\\".It's that horrible.<br /><br />8.  THURSDAY - This is the track that has the most 80s feel to it and sounds closest to true PSB style...or so I thought.  The beginning of the song is sure to lead you astray if that's what you thought.  The lyrics are totally lacking in intelligence.  \\"Stay with me for the weekend...\\" Umm ok.  Then you have Example (whoever that is) coming in to turn the song into a rap/hip-hop track.  Ehh I'll pass on this one, too.<br /><br />9.  VOCAL - Not a bad track to end the album.  Neil's vocals sound really crisp on this one, more so than the rest of the songs here.  Again, the lyrics aren't too deep.  \\"It's in the music, they play it all night long\\"....again, about going out to the club.<br /><br />Overall, 3.5 out of 5 stars (and no, I wasn't willing to round it up to 4).  Gotta say I miss the old boys!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|An incredible story of life and survival and the belief in \\"God\\" like you have never thought of before. Fascinating and different perspective of how one see 's God. Loved this book, yet I will warn you it is a raw description of faith on a relentless sea.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if you've seen despicible me,then this is the app for you.it's kind of a spin-off from Subway Suffers.this is an app for all ages.you are a minion just plain running nonstop,but you can also fight Vector and a new enemy:Meena.this is a great app in total.
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|Compared to The Ultimate Matrix Collection (added 35 hours of new bonus features) and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition (new comprehensive documentaries about the creation of the first four films AND of Superman's mythological history; 20+ hours of new content),<br />This set is unbelievably NOT worth it.<br /><br />So you want the little toys? Yes, Little toys, Because that's what every serious collector of film sets needs on their shelves, right? Something more befitting a happy meal than a collector of one of the best film trilogies ever made?<br /><br />It does nothing to address the technical shortcomings of the first two films' home releases, and it has a rather shameful lack of new bonus material (many fans were really hoping for some sort of commentary track on one or all of the films by director Christopher Nolan).<br />I'd really encourage you to avoid this set, especially if you have all three films already. In the best case scenario, a double dip release will have significantly more material than the original, easily justifying spending more money on the same films. With The Dark Knight Trilogy set that's being proposed here, this is definitely not the case.<br />-Chris Clow, Geek Nation
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very well written book. You become entangled in the characters lives.<br />Christina McKenna brings the characters in her books to life. You feel if you are actually an observer, not a reader. Looking forward to reading more from Ms. McKenna!der.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found myself wanting to go in late to work so that I could hear the next development.... I absolutely *loved* Will and \\"Clark\\" and all those surrounding.... Well read, Audible.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Cassie has done it again.<br />Markus Zusak once said &#34; sometimes you read a book so special, that you want to carry it around with you months after you finish, just to be near it. &#34;<br />This is one of those books. It's too good for words. We need some new words!
1608955702|5.0|I've been shooting pro for about five years and I'm trying to learn from others photographer every time as possible, but the simplicity that Neil use in this book is awesome. His technics in bouncing the flash is giving me amazing results. Thank you so much Neil.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I played this for several levels. It is not a very intuitive game and I got tired of trying to figure out where the next clue was on my smartphone. It might be better if played on a tablet but didn't bother.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|For those who love classical music and Maggie Smith, this is a great movie. The plot is a little weak.
0307352153|5.0|If you are taking intro psych class, this book can really help you see psychology in a different way and yourself, too.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Hubby always wants to see James Bond movies He is so cool to look at--- but story? plot?  ugh i slept?
B004SEUIXS|5.0|It's  a warms my heart and there is no violence.  Audrey Tattou is brilliant.  And the rest of the cast are really good too
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|We wondered why this wasn't more talked about?  Probably because it brought up SO many issues.<br />What did it matter? since he saved so many? People can be be so small minded.
1419705849|5.0|He has all of the books... he reads them repeatedly... I wish he was reading classic books... well... whatever helps him to enjoy reading! thanks!
B0052GVGYG|5.0|I've always loved Susan Tedeschi and love her voice with her husband's rocking band. It's a terrific album from some soulful rockers!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|It contains everything: talented actors, good scenario, suspense and things that happens to anyone in the day to day life.<br />Besides, as some hundred millions of other men, I love Beckett :-)
B002ZG976U|2.0|Burlesque is the age old story of a small-town wannabe singer trying to make it in the big leagues. Basic, generic crap too good for the stars it snagged. I would have been happier listening to Cher and Christina Aguilera albums - the music was the only enjoyable part of the movie! Without Christina's dynamite singing power and Cher's powerhouse solos, this movie does not have a leg to stand on. Its cheap worn-out plot, abundant clichés, and lame excuses for 'drama' within the film render it incredibly and mindbogglingly pointless. Don't waste your time!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As others have said, a lot like Myst. Looking forward to more rooms. Great game. I used coins, so didn't have to pay. Not worth real money. Game is too short
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Loved it, just like it says. The controls were a little clunky at first but this is fantastic for someone who doesn't have a lot of magic players nearby. Thank you for making this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|completely addicted to this game! had a lot of trouble getting it to work for the first day but it was well worth it
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I like the story, there is enough happening, to keep interest up, sometimes the erotica is a little too much, ie gets in the way of the yarn. Mostly it's relevent though.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The Pact : Is a book that kept me on the edge, I have never read a  book written by Jodi Picoult.<br />She was able to capture, the rawest and truest emotions that are usually concealed. Very great book to indulge during the summer months.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I don't often think a story is worth five stars, but this appeals to me, and I have read several times.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Much better than book 4. I struggled through book 4. I actually quit twice.  Book 5 was a breeze to read through.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Great characters, dialogue, settings, story. The film puts it all together for a beautiful view of human beings meeting advancing age with grace and passion.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had fun for a while but got caught in a circle and couldn't figure out how to escape. No help offered. Deleted it
B007SSEZNA|3.0|Rather slow, but fine characters and acting. A good film for those who love the English countryside and appreciate characters and styles.
B009CG0UKI|5.0|This movie is a must see. It is, hands down, one of the greatest drug mafia movie ever made *in my opinion* If you haven't seen this movie you have failed in life
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so fun and feels like I have a real horse! The graphics are amazing and its easy enough for small kids to play and love
0785153942|2.0|As one reviewer mentioned, it's a great introduction to the movie. But that's really all there is to it. I felt it's too short and is written in a way that you'll want more and of course, see the movie. It covers some of the major events as to how things came about. If you came out of the movie wanting to see more Jaegers in action you won't find it here.<br /><br />For the price it's really disappointing. This really should've been a freebie or promo comic that you hand out to people for a premiere showing. The movie is spectacular BTW.
0451196716|5.0|While i've read much of mr. Kings works and found many levels of possible meanings and impact, The Long Walk was a surprise to say the least! It draws the reader in, to a point of seemingly partaking in the race oneself, facing their fears and pain, the horror of fate inescapable.<br /><br />Over my life i have read a LOT of fiction, and this is the ONLY work that gave me nightmares! Honestly!<br /><br />It's  a marvelously crafted story of  a society and those who comprise it, and what some will attempt,  despite overwhelming odds, to outrun the dispair of their own lives.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Not bad. Not great either. These dudes are all old now. The acting and script are predictable. That's about it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is wonderful. It has great quality and makes Twitter very enjoyable(: I would really recommend this app to my friends.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I found this book quite boring in parts mainly due to too much repeated detail. I am now starting to read the authors second book, A Thousand Splendid Suns and am enjoying it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app has wonderful quality. It makes Facebook very easy. Its so easy to chat, post a status, and especially easy to upload photos(:
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Love this it's touching and sweet I would read it again I would suggest this book yo any one that can read
B008M721MS|1.0|This app is horrible. It kept ending my calls and it logged me out and wouldnt let me back in!!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I really like the zombie genre, but would not rank this in my top 10 favorite. It really did not offer a new twist or insight into the zombie apocalypse scenario, the main difference was the format of serial short stories from survivors. I found it kind of frustrating to read, but it was well written so that is purely a style preference on my part. Going to see the movie soon, so it will at least make an interesting comparison. Worth it for $5, so you might want to hit a used book store rather than pay full price for the e book version.
0767817478|5.0|i remember them when i was a kid these were good godzilla film fighting bad monsters and godzilla destroying tokyo i also remember the game that was fun to play and pick your own monster and great effects too
B00846REIS|5.0|I was absolutely hooked to this story from the first few pages!  I thought the book was even better than \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", because it left out all of the acts that seem threatening to many people (whips, cuffs, etc.).  Gideon is still a very rich and powerful man, with past issues, but his instant attraction to Eva was not about signing contracts for a particular time frame.  There is so much happening in this book, and the reader feels every emotion that Eva feels, as she tells the story.  Since she has money, as well, Gideon can't \\"buy\\" her, so I liked that she had so much free will, and was only driven by her emotional attachment to Gideon.  I can't wait for a fourth book!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|nope not for me...iam sure its fun to others....I ran out of points i guess...it just stoped...so matbe iam to old...just didnt work for me
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This is a very well done film--but very disturbing. It should be required viewing for all Americans. I did not understand the implications of the &#34;Halliburton loophole&#34; until I watched this.
B009B2VBWE|4.0|I love this great album. It was a pleasant surprise. I would warn long-time fans of Diane Krall that this is quite different from the Krall we know. The songs are all good ones and well performed. If you lean toward albums like Ute Lemper's Berlin Cabaret Songs, Peggy Lee's Mirrors or Jason Danieley and the New Frontier, you won't be disappointed. The cover photo tells the story.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I expected to love this book because I was enthralled by the premise.  However, by the time I was halfway through reading it I started mumbling to myself, &#34;Come on.  Get on with it!&#34;  The book was excessively and unnecessarily long.  The story line was a good one, but too many characters and too much &#34;fleshing out&#34; of them all made the reading of this a chore.  Frankly, I doubt I would read another book by this author, in spite of the great reviews many people have given his work.  Life's too short!
B0043URV5U|5.0|This is the best Bob Seger CD with his hits from all times. If you love Seger this is a party CD or a driving CD for you.
0307454568|5.0|I am NOT an editor or much of a reviewer; but the trilogy of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo novels were great to read.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|love Joss Whedon. quality actors and a good storyline. every character is written strong within themselves and don't need to rely on others to prop them up. enough said.
B0067R0APK|4.0|large enough for me to see. am satisfied with this app would reccomend  this product.have been using this app since Dec.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|No words are needed. This was/is/will always be the best Dr. Who of all the Who's....the man himself, David Tennant. So season 4, well, it just can't get any better.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|at some point the quests require social media (I don't want to spam my facebook friends)  or money (sorry, but NO) . otherwise,  this is a fun albeit overly repetitive game.
1741798485|5.0|I had the earlier version for my trip in 2003 and it was fantastic so when I was traveling here for 3 weeks this time in 2013, I got the newest addition! Worth every penny!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read. When I started reading this book, I could not put it down. I am going to read it again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Gillian Flynn is a brilliant author!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Way too much foul language and it just was SO boring! Two and a half hours of my life I will never get back!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very fun game. The graphics are great, the game play is real smooth. You don't need to use real money to play but the game would be much easier and quicker if you did. The only bad thing I've found so far is the size of the V-pad. The pad is fairly small and I have big thumbs other than that, great game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a pretty good game but it'll get you hooked on it. My kids like this game too. It's easy to play
B00CH26TL8|2.0|At first I really enjoyed the game, but the higher the level, the more difficult it became. It would be bearable, and not so discouraging if they made it possible to win without buying anything. And it's not like it's 99 cents, no it's2.99, which in my opinion is ridiculous.
B002361MLA|4.0|Written in a style similar to Epictetus's discourses.  The first few chapters are a bit dryer, however, once you get into the book a bit the subject matter is deeper and it finished well for me.  This is a book I would give to people who were serious about spiritual study.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I love playing this game, he's 4 and asks so many times a day to play this game.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|this game is amazing if u like temple run this is just like it except its a bigger envirement also u get guns and other weapons and change what u want ur zombies to look like.
B007R108WA|3.0|concept and acting was good presentation was poor. The ending is very surreal, and I felt shorted somehow. The main character was very hard to identify with for me. I was apathetic when it came to the main character, and even the victims he murdered. It came up short
0061733199|4.0|To the various reviews I've seen saying that this book is super small all I've got to say is perhaps you've got the old addition.<br /><br />My copy was a standard 5in x 7in or so, very easy to read and the pages are not just paper, they're treated with a coating of some kind so they'll survive being read in the rain or getting soaked in your backpack.<br /><br />Having said that, while this is a great book to start with, you just can't cover ALL areas of survival in 576 pages. So I'd recommend getting this book for sure, however, when it comes to edible plants, plants which can be used for medicine, used for making shelters/tools, etc. I'd recommend getting an additional reference book specific to the region of the world you expect to be surviving in.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this!!  It really locks out everything except the apps you want your kids to play with.  I don't have to worry about them going anywhere else on the tablet, deleting anything, or buying anything.  I am so thankful to have found this!
1594135851|5.0|I've gone thru a considerable number of fictional stories and this one comes as one of the most original. Katniss Everdeen is a very strong charecter but also a realistic one. Overall, this book is a fast read but an entertaining one al the least.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great cast and great plot.  I really liked this movie and the chemistry between the cast.  Helen Mirren is so fun in this movie!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|love him, love him, thought his performance was amazing as the others he has made.  would recommend everyone to see it
B000GCFG7E|5.0|what can i say about lee child... he always has me on the edge of my seat in suspense.  get it.
B004G600A4|5.0|This was a &#34;winner&#34; with my grandkids.  I highly recommend adding it to your collection of good entertainment for the entire family.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Peppered with several cameo appearances and great tongue in cheek humor! I can't wait for the third installment to come out!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very cute game with your favorite Minions! Fun bonus moves and interesting runs. Glad to find it on the Amazon App Store.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Leaving storyline aside (plenty of reading on that elsewhere), this movie is the penultimate 3D experience to date. The sound and video 3D is just breathtaking at times. Really fun to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is so fun and addictive. It's somewhat linear how to find stuff and even use the stuff you have, but that's obviously the point of the game. There are only 10 levels, but it takes ~10 min to complete each, and multilevel are on the way. Overall, a very fun and challenging game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Entertaining with the aspect of a possiblility. The sequels, not so.  The movie is great, anticipating the Catching Fire movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was a great film; great casting, great pacing and great period design.  I really enjoyed this film. Great job Affleck!!
0984380213|4.0|The book contained great sales advice, and despite having been in sales and marketing leadership for over 25 years across a variety of companies, I picked up some good ideas for driving increased sales.
B005GSY23M|3.0|When i watched the movie I thought the soundtrack was a huge part of the setting. it really set the mood/tone of the film. When I downloaded it, i heard a few of the songs I was expecting, but several of them were long and drawn out. Prob my fault for not listeing to the entire album before purchasing. Just a heads up to the rest of you.
B0083Z614S|1.0|Best book ever I so liked it it was.like ice cream have y'all ever had chicken nuggets o) yeah love it
B003CRM6QO|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was.  I became interested in seeing this one after seeing all of the references to it in the TED movie.<br /><br />First off for an old movie made into Blu-Ray, this looks really good.  It looks as clean and sharp as a movie that just came out today.  This is especially obvious in the scene where Sam Jones is flying to planet Mongo, it looks so good.  The Goonies and the Fletch movie on the other hand look terrible as a Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The content of the movie is quite a thing.  As a fan of UK dance music I found it amazing to see how classic dance tracks sampled sections of this movie.  The Prodigy's \\"Poison\\" track sampled the \\"Yah\\" sound when Ming's robot blasted the lizard man.  Even more so, Ed Rush's \\"Blodclott Artattack\\" from 1993 is a tune completly based around Ming's ring sound effect and the strings played during the scene where Ming is fondling the lead actress through telepathy.  There is a 3rd uk jungle track from around 1993 that also sampled music in the movie but I don't know the name of it yet.<br /><br />Lastly this movie seems to make fun of itself every chance it can get.  The scene at the end featuring Sam Jones and the birdman is extremely funny.<br /><br />All in all this was a great movie, I really didn't think I would enjoy it this much, I'm suprised.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook app for Kindle Fire HD keeps crashing and sometimes it gets so bad I have to uninstall and then reinstall...I wish there was an update for this app..
B009N4QJ54|5.0|This is a delightfully absurd movie with a wonderful quirky style.  It's one of those movies I'll turn on whenever I can't figure out what to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was fantastic! I just couldn't put it down and wasn't disappointed at all! I can't wait to finish the series!

0553386794|5.0|This is an addictive read with incredible ,descriptive visuals &  great character development.<br />He makes the characters so real that they seem as if they are actually historical.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|After being hyped up for months on end with trailers, pictures, and secrets about this movie, it's over.  Superman has arrived in a new cool suit.<br /><br />Wow, where do you begin?  Well, how about Russell Crowe delivering a baby on the dying planet of Krypton.  I often wonder if alien planets were out there, would their technology look as cool as the stuff we imagine?  Kudos to the minds who thought up these visuals.  Perhaps they had an alien muse from Area 51. Aside from the nifty technology, Crowe was great throughout the picture alive and dead (you'll have to figure that one out).<br /><br />Move onto planet earth with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, more legends on the screen giving great performances.  The movie offers insight into Superman's younger years with terrific performance from the young lad (Dylan Sprayberry), who plays his part.  It's an internal struggle that Clark must journey on his own to find his identify.  His earthly father teaches him wisdom and restraint with his gifts, until he finally meets his real father and learns of his origins and why he is on planet earth.<br /><br />Enter cute Amy Adams who plays Lois Lane, destined to fall in love with Superman.  As one army woman says at the end, \\"I think he's hot.\\"  And hot he is!  Henry Cavill did a great job in the role with the internal identity struggle and the will to do good among the humans he has lived with for thirty-plus years.  It's not until the end in order to save the planet does he finally succumb to willfully killing another to save others.  Amy is cute in her own right, falling in love with a handsome well-dressed alien in red and blue, but she is also acquainted with the man in jeans and a tee shirt.  I'm sorry, but you just can't help but wonder what making love to Superman would be like - perhaps we shouldn't go down that road.<br /><br />The technology of the aliens is quite cool.  The alien ships, suits, and costumes are unique. Though many humans are killed in the battle for earth, there isn't a lot of blood and gore.<br /><br />The only complaint I really had about the movie was the lengthy fight scenes between Superman and the aliens.  They seemed to go on forever, and frankly I think they could have cut a good half-hour out of the movie.  All right, you get the point, it's a fight of evil and good, but a few good cuts on the editing floor would have done the movie better.  My guess is the guys in special effects were like kids having too much fun seeing how many walls and buildings they could throw Superman and his enemies through.<br /><br />Of course, as you watch the movie you think things like -- How can he fly in space without air?  How can he get beat up for a half hour straight and not have a scratch or drop of blood on him?  How can he walk through fire?  How can he breathe under water? How could society recover at the end with so much devastation?  The list goes on and on - but hey, it's Superman!  I suppose if we ever do get invaded by aliens, I'd like this dude on my side.<br /><br />It's quite obvious at the end that sequels are coming, because it ends with Clark Kent getting a job at the Daily Planet to blend into society. Of course, Lois Lane, who has probably kissed him a few more times by now, knows his secret!<br /><br />One more note, Hans Zimmer does a great job at a musical score.  A bit dark like the Dark Knight, but nonetheless quite good.  I love the guy's music anyway.<br /><br />Is it worth the watch?  Sure.  Just for the story and the visuals, plus the top-notch stars in the movie.  Is it worth two-hours and twenty-three minutes?  I could have done with one and forty-five and less fighting between Superman and Zod (played by Michael Shannon), who by the way is one of those damn villains who just won't die!<br /><br />All in all, Superman is just super. It is not a movie filled with jokes and lighthearted scenes. It's serious. He overcomes obstacles constantly when he should have died at least twenty times in the movie from all that he went through to save the human race.  Probably a little over-the-top but that's the movies.  It's all make believe, epic sci-fi special effects, and cute Henry Cavill in one good looking suit.<br /><br />And it's not an \\"S\\" on his chest - it's a symbol that means hope.  But on earth, it's an \\"S\\" to us, standing for Superman.  There are some great lines in the movie that stay with you.<br /><br />\\"You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.\\"<br /><br />If only the human race could really accomplish wonders and rise above a Zod mentality. Surely, we need someone to show us the way, even if it's in a movie.s in the movie from all that he went through to save the human race.  Probably a little over-the-top but that's the movies.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic, fascinating, addictive on all levels. Exactly what we learned to expect from its predecessor. Beware, you might find yourself staying up all night chugging through the whole season.
0810995212|4.0|This book contains rare, excellent color reproductions of not only most of Leyendecker's finished illustrations but also many of his preliminary studies. I find this a wonderful surprise because I had thought a lot of his originals were sold and virtually lost after his death.<br /><br />As an art student in the 1950s, I first discovered Lyendecker's work while studying illustrations in bound volumes of the Saturday Evening Post in a library. I have been a fan of his work throughout my career.<br /><br />The authors have presented a fairly detailed story of Leyendecker's life. This again is a surprise because he was a very private person, living in seclusion after 1930. The authors place too much emphasis on the fact that he was a homosexual. They interpret some as his work as being a homosexual statement of some sort. They are way off in this conclusion, as they are in much of the text, inserting their opinions into biographical writing.<br /><br />Leyendecker had a lot to do with the growing power of advertising but he was not the only force at that time. The authors give JC and Arrow Shirts too much credit regarding the establishment of branding in marketing. Coca-Cola, Ford and a few others had a little influence also.<br /><br />The authors are much too critical of Norman Rockwell and his relationship with Leyendecker. Leyendecker was Rockwell's idol. Rockwell was one of the few people who attended JC's funeral. Rockwell admits that, as a young illustrator, he tried to emulate Lyendecker's style. By 1916 Rockwell was a Post cover artist himself and he soon fell into his own way of working. While Rockwell thought so much of Leyendecker and his work, he did not personally approvel of his life style.<br /><br />This is a first rate book --in spite of the text--because it is a marvelous, rich collection of work by one of America's greatest illustrators.<br /><br />Paul Sullivan
B007V65R54|5.0|Great information, backed up by science and woven together with great stories. I loved discussion about the application of prediction to baseball and politics. I was surprised by the difference seen in weather forecasting and the prediction of earthquakes. The discussion on climate change / warming was a different take that, with the benefit of hindsight, now seems logical. And the discussion on predicting things like terrorism events was enlightening.<br /><br />This book really helps you understand prediction from a person who is known to get real results. But understand that, like the real world, this discussion is not black and white, there is no simple approach, and because of this the book requires a mindset that is open and that can evolve based on new information.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The best book series EVER!!  I totally loved it.  I read it twice so far and plan on reading it again.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Haven't used it much other than for a bible I have on it. I take my actual kindle most places with me anyway.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was very inspiring for me.  She had a lot of guts to do what she did.  I love how strong she is.
B004I744AS|5.0|Love having a dictionary on my phone. I am the person who likes to look up something when i am in a seminar, conference or even at church. Handy to have!
B007P06DOK|5.0|Always have enjoyed Paul Simon.  I had this originally in a cassette tape version, love the CD. The last track is a good explanation of the collaboration that went into this total package.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A bible is a handy thing to have anywhere you are going. Having am easy reference is great for me.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I have read all of Lee Childs books.  Love all of them.  Can't wait for the next one that is out in September.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It's a game. great for filling time and amusing yourself when you are bored. I have other games I like more but this one is good too.
1936719010|2.0|Do the Work is a pale reflection of Pressfield's better books.  Yes, there are a few inspiring ideas in this book, but overall the book lacks the coherence and drive and interesting topics Pressfield is known for.<br /><br />Avoid this book.  Every author fails once in a while.  Big deal.<br /><br />Pressfield has written two books that will serve you as imperative and passionate life guides: [[ASIN:1936891026 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]] and [[ASIN:1936891034 Turning Pro: Tap Your Inner Power and Create Your Life's Work]].<br /><br />On that note, if you are trying to figure out what to do in life, or what would make you the happiest, check out another excellent book: [[ASIN:0898799759 Bliss: Writing to Find Your True Self]] or on Kindle--[[ASIN:B009ST7GTC Bliss: Writing to Find Your True Self]].<br /><br />Between those three books, you will come to a load of conclusions about yourself and your calling and your career options in this life.  Really interesting stuff.  Fascinating, even.  But Do the Work is not.  :(  As one reviewer commented, you'd be better off doing some work--any work--than reading this book.
B00C061I3K|5.0|A great album with an amazing variety of sounds.  Each track is very different, a big departure from their last album while maintaing that &#34;Daft Punk&#34; spirit.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I found the story to be believable and captivating.  It was an easy and enjoyable read.. I'm anxious to see the movie!
B0079LJZG8|5.0|This is a spy movie about the real spy game and not the highly embellished and stylized world of Bond.  If you are looking for explosions and sports cars, you will be disappointed.  It does help to have read the book, but it is a marvelous thing to watch.  Intelligently written, nimbly and superbly acted, perfectly directed.  It is the intelligent person's spy film.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|This is a terrible movie with little to no redeeming qualities. Even the chase scenes were boring. Don't waste your time.
1611761069|5.0|I read just about anything that Patricia Cornwell writes.  She always delivers a good story and this one finds Kay in hot water again.
044024630X|5.0|One of my favorite continuing characters.  This book was not a disappointment.  I enjoyed it from cover to cover and read it in a two day period--wanting more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is on fire!! It's walking on fire!!! It's real ly awe some a a awww a a a
B004QSQML8|4.0|I'm not going to get into how good this movie is, because this is not a movie review, but a product review. I was very happy with this purchase, the hi-def video and audio really stand out, it almost looks like it was filmed modern day. I wasn't particularly a fan of the alternate soundtrack, but the product is great none the less.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app does exactly what it states. It allows you to stream any data from your computer to your Kindle including movies, songs, etc. And very clearly at that. Definitely worth the cash outlay.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game so much that I go crazy. I been doing this game for ten years on my friend's IPad.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Roman and Greek Mythology mixed is really cool and a suspenseful ending! This book was very very good and exciting!
0060936223|1.0|Hey Patti, I like how you leave out the interesting parts about becoming punk rock star and focus on the boring parts of your life. You keep keep waiting for her to explain at some point how I don't know how she became a star. No, much more interesting to hear her random name dropping and a superficial explanation of events in her life. Then this happened, then this happened, then I talked to Jimi Hendrix, then this happened, then this happened, then I was a hit singer, then Robert died.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|My kid loved it! He really thought it was funny. We will never look at cheese the same again! Good book.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|This is a good movie, I was not sure about the title but it ended up being a good flick to watch
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is awesome  this game is not like other games.<br />This game is awesome and you are going to love this game.<br />Ever since  I bought this game I have been concentrating on this game.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I will recommend who need to transfer pics from the camera using Sd card or camera usb. That is a lot better than Wifi from the camera. I can do it everywhere during traveling.
B0098460O4|5.0|We had been looking for this CD for ages in NZ and it is a joy to listen tom many thanks.
B00D5O7BPU|1.0|I bought it for my son and he removed it from his device within 5 minutes. It is a waste of money.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|The quality of the watch is great I love it I shopped for a long time and it just what I was looking for.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|WONDERFUL ACTING, INSPIRING, CAPTIVATING....COULD NOT WAIT TO SEE ANOTHER EPISODE.....GREAT DIALOGUES AND REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS...GREAT CASTINGS!<br /><br />ANXIOUS TO SEE SEASON 4!....... 5....6...HOPEFULLY TOO!
0425264351|1.0|This book was dreadful and a total waste of time. I should have put it down after chapter one, but figured a book this bad had to get better. Sadly it didn't and the ending was just as stupid and ridiculous as the rest of the book. UGH!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|It was so emotional it didn't back down from mans capacity for cruelty at the cost of innocence. It embraced what is our greatest fears and brought them to light it also let you see how powerful love is, what it can sustain and how it can endure. This book focused on the characters it was about and had other thoughts intertwined as needed, but the main focus remained on the two central characters. Loved it!!
B000FC10MU|4.0|Good overall read. Interesting ideas about old gods of all the immigrants. Kinda wordy and slow at points but good ending.
1416972242|5.0|I just love this authors writing; very hilarious stuff with the characters, you can really feel what's going on. City of Ashes was a fun read.  We get to see more development plotwise and the bad  Valentine is just a super badass.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Really beautifully filmed. The corpse as sculpture ... each episode's piece de resistance topping the next. Superhero like story line of the evil genius type. A rembrandt painted comic book . Somehow only the audience perceives the cold core in Hannibal, a man so slithering that satan was rejected when he auditioned for the part.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I LIKE THE REALISTIC BARN AND PADDOCK GRAPHICS. I WISH THEY HAD MORE HORSE OPTIONS, I WANTED A PALEMINO OR AN ARABIAN. OTHER THEN THAT I LOVE THE APP AND AM HAVING FUN WITH IT.
0812550706|3.0|Interesting premise, a couple of good twists. I figured with this Scott Card guy trying so hard to get gay married or whatever, this book would be super hot. There is one shower scene but nothing good happens, in fact I hardly masturbated to this book at all.<br /><br />Scott Card may be the most boring porn author to ever gay up gaysville.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Am collecting all the season's of NCIS. I am a big fan and never tire of watching them. You had very good service and will be using you again.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Never try it I downloaded this and I didn't even get past the first screen when it said I could not play it on my kindle fire HD so I am so disappointed and a shamed I think that they should make the game so u could actually play it :(  !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|soooooo fun I enjoy it so much. I love this game I am obsessed with this game soooooo MUCH. I have to stop saying much.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|The package of product is fine.<br /><br />I could't believe that I bought this in here was cheaper than His Master Voice in Hong Kong.<br /><br />If someone like value for money, this is.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|There actually was a place like this in France, which is one of the reasons I became interested in the movie.  Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses, so I new it would be a great movie.  Also wanted to see Dustin Hoffman's directing debut.  I was entertained, loved the humor and compassion.  Don't forget to read the credits at the end.  Don't want to give it away.  It's a nice surprise and something I did not know about the move.  Enjoy!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The app was really nice. I am a World War two lover. It really shows how to load the gun and shoot it. If you like guns and World War Two you should get this app!
B008KLTXEA|5.0|Oh yeah, these young men delivered! The program was awesome that this DVD was made from! You won't be disappointed! I enjoyed the song Thank You!! Oh this DVD is so fun!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|As the title says this game is super addictive and kills down time quickly.  Sometimes I can't put it down. Best put is its very kid friendly!
B001L5J5GS|5.0|My original LP had 2 serious scratches on it, one of which was a skip on &#34;25 or 6 to 4&#34;, which led me to search for a replacement. I was a little daunted by the pricing of these LP reproductions, but the glowing reviews decided it for me. I'm glad I ordered it; the sound quality is excellent and it is worth the price to enjoy all the songs on this album, some of which I haven't heard since the younger days...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really like this game lots of fun. This is very challenging as well which is great when your board. There is nothing wrong with this game if you ask me.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It really feels like I am playing on my computer instead of my Kindle.  Graphics are great, it is challenging and I am having a wonderful time playing it... you will not be sorry you got this app!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. WHAT IS REAL WHAT IS CONJECTURE. IN THE END WE HAVE TO DECIDE FOR OURSELVES. LIKE BEING A JUROR.

1781162646|4.0|I love Stephen King and have read everything he's written.  Some were amazing.  Some were terrible.  This one is really good.  Not scary.  A good, interesting, well-plotted murder mystery.  Sort of.  Thanks Uncle Stevie!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|If you are a Les Mis fan this is a must have! This concert features an all star cast from some of the best Les Mis casts from around the world.<br /><br />Be sure to stay tuned at the end to see 4 Valjeans singing together.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Alright, people, for all you that think that better than minecraft and all, I'm telling you, sure, you can spawn all sorts of animals and stuff, but all of these copies of our beloved minecraft are stupid.<br /><br />Now that I'm done bickering about how survivalcraft COMEPLETELY COPIES minecraft, let's get to the point. Firstly, you can't split up stacks, so you have to always make at least four crafting tables, for example. For another, night is PITCH BLACK, so you either sit there, or stumble around blind. And, worst of all, you can't sleep unless you have an entire house!<br /><br />In a word, stupid.<br /><br />Long live minecraft!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This is the first Doctor I watched. I fell in love. Amazing series. A wonderful display of drama and becomes very addicting.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|What more needs to be said? One of the great novels of all time. I challenge any one to not be moved by this work.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's an okay game, but I really don't want to connect to Facebook and I can't seem to get any further then play the short version of the game because of it. I guess maybe if I purchase some coins I may get further.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Ninja with hand guns or Remo Williams on steroids.  If you can look past that it is a lot of fun.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm sorry that this the last book of the series because I've always loved the Sookie series, it's going to be a great loss for me

B007SPPANM|5.0|A movie I will watch at least twice a year.  The story is so compelling.  James Cameron gave us a believable story  built around this gigantic tragedy.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Such an incredible series! I got this as a birthday gift for my husband because he loves the series and I ended up watching it and loving it as much as he does! Includes all complete episodes and bonus features; very much worth the price!
B00860YICC|5.0|This is a tale that rivets your attention.  It brings up so many emotions that it, too, has become a repeat movie in my home.  I make all my guests who have not seen it, watch it with me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I would not consider myself an avid book reader, but from seeing some of the earlier previews of the upcoming movie I thought I would check it out before the release.<br /><br />It was disappointing at first to learn this book was written in the early 80's as I figured it would be really outdated. As soon as I started to read this quickly became a non issue. This book stayed mostly in the mind of the main character and was really engaging. Even though the majority of the book you are in the mind of a child between 6-12, it doesn't have an adolescent feel to this book. The book took me in a few different directions that I did not expect, but in which I really enjoyed.<br /><br />The only real disappointment I have now is knowing there is no way the movie can do this book any justice. So much of what makes this book enjoyable is the emotion mostly coming from internal conflicts.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game it is hard. you need to think a lot.it is hard to escape. sometime is said in my mine I can't escape.it gets harder and harder each time. get this app and good luck.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Maybe it's not the best, but as solitaire's go it pretty good for relieving boredom or whiling the time away.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|That wasn't even a complete story. It didn't even follow a normal story arch. No progression, climax, resolution. I expect that even though there would be another book, for a Full story to take place if I'm spending money on it. I feel cheated out of money because this wasn't complete. Didn't end in a natural place. I love these stories but it's not okay to do this to people who have already bought three books and not even give a full story.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|When I am dealt a card, it usually goes into the hand - but I don't get to really see it to know even what color it is. THEN the &#34;game&#34; reminds me if I can play the card (or it just sits there and waits for me).<br /><br />Second, when another player wins the hand the &#34;game&#34; says &#34;YOU LOSE&#34; and dumps it down the screen. To be quite honest, I know I didn't win, so don't tell me I'm a &#34;loser&#34; - some people (especially, if depressed) could really take that badly. I quite like that &#34;Jack&#34; won - so play that up a bit (with a star or trophy).<br /><br />Mostly, I like the game. It seems a little slow at times but is overall good!

B003BM374K|4.0|BALLET SHOES is a 2007 British television film, based on a 1936 novel by Noel Streatfeild, with screenplay by Heidi Thomas, and directed by Sandra Goldbacher.<br />  Set in 1930's London, the film tells the stoy of three orphans adopted by an explorer and paleontologist, Uncle Matthew \\"Gum\\".  The girls live in near poverty in his house with his niece, Silvia Brown, and her former nanny, Nana.  The story describes the girls' struggles to fulfill their dreams: Pauline as an actress, Petrova as an aviatrix, and Posy as a ballerina.  To help make ends meet, Silvia and Nana take in boarders.  Still, the household needs the wages of Pauline as an actress and Petrova as an extra, putting additional weight on their shoulders.<br />  The film can teach young viewers some valudable lessions, such as the good and bad aspects of ambition, the need for perseverance in hard times, and the pitfalls of a swelled head. And for adult viewers, there is the acting!  Emilia Fox, Victoria Wood, Eileen Atkins, and Emma Watson are the leads.  Yasmin Paige and Lucy Boynton are the younger sisters.  And there is the usual excellent British supporting case, including Richard Griffiths and Gemma Jones, also from HARRY POTTER.<br />  Watch it with your young daughters, and if you have none, watch it for yourself.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|As I type this, I am listening to the movie Rocky Balboa playing on FX channel.  I've seen it before, more than once.  What can one say?  I feel this is on par or even better than the original Rocky, if that's possible.  Sylvester Stallone gave us something we sorely needed:  closure.  This movie shows a more mature, wiser Rocky, still with heart and still the Rocky we all came to love.<br /><br />This movie is a tearjerker (at least for me).  Maybe that's because it brought back many memories for me.  Aside from personal memories, the genius of this movie is that it conjures up all the old, lovely memories from the original Rocky movie, while keeping everything fresh and real and smart.<br /><br />I don't want to talk about the plot for fear of a spoiler for those who have not yet seen it. All I can say is if you loved the original Rocky, you may love this even more.  A wonderful, heartfelt, respectful closure to the Rocky series.  It was well worth waiting for.
B000NY12CI|5.0|This book is a compelling autobiographical memoir by Ali, who was brought up in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya in Somali muslim culture (different from Saudi, as she points out in the book) until she was about 20, when her father contracted her marriage to a distant relative in Canada whom she had never met.<br /><br />She got as far as Frankfurt on her way to Canada, decided, “screw this,” and got on a train for Holland, where she finagled her way into refugee status, and eventually obtained Dutch citizenship, got a university degree, and was elected to Parliament.<br /><br />During the course of all this, her eyes gradually opened to the b.s. that is islam, and she became an outspoken apostate. She wrote the short film that Theo van Gogh produced and directed that got him killed by a Moroccan muslim. Her view is that western liberal democracies have completely the wrong attitude to muslims—the “we subscribe to religious freedom, so we should let them have their madrassahs and separate communities in our countries and eventually they will assimilate” attitude. She makes the point that there is no separation between religion and society in the muslim world, and their entire upbringing, even the ‘liberal’ ones teaches them that they are morally and intellectually superior to decadent westerners, who are responsible for all the bad things that befall the Islamic world.<br /><br />What I find most interesting is that she is dead-on when she describes the muslim mindset. Even in todays news where a taliban commander wrote a letter to the young child they almost killed by shooting her in the head, you'll appreciate Ali's book even more, Phrases like &#34;whether it is right or wrong islamically to have done this, let's let Allah be the judge&#34; becomes that much more understandable after reading Ali's book. A very fast read. She has a wonderful writing style.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This is a wonderfully made movie.  My husband is a teacher of American History and this is one of his favorites.  It has wonderfully made and authentic battle scenes.  The one of the taking of the Fort William Henry is very important in our American History lessons.  The acting is wonderful.  Daniel Day Lewis is the best actor of all time!  He is excellent in everything he has done.  Watch this movie more than one time!  You will see different things every time you watch it.

B00001U03Q|5.0|A classic album from a classic musician. Clapton has endured and remains a legacy. I would recommend this to any music lover.
B009AP2G26|3.0|I really loved the first three seasons and own all the dvds but I just didn't feel the 4th season measured up.  The music wasn't as good, the new actors they brought in were average, and I really missed Rachel, Finn, Blaine and Kurt.  They didn't utilize the existing characters enough.  I think they should just pack it in.  With Finn gone, the show will fail this year.

0765322889|1.0|I am not among the uninitiated when it comes to the Epic Fantasy genre having read the works of Brooks, Jordan, Goodkind, Nixx, Martin, etc. I really enjoyed their works so when I heard that Erikson's books were comparable in quality to Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire I was intrigued and thought I'd see what all the praise was about.<br /><br />I have never read such a poorly written book in my entire life, EVER! If someone gave me this book told me a drunk high schooler wrote it I would believe them, I would not have believe it was a published work. There are several reasons for this which I will outline.<br /><br />First and foremost, there is absolutely no character development in the book... anywhere. This is because before you can get to know one character and find out what motivates them, what they're made of, a new character is thrown into the fray. Not only this but the characters are very boring, with stereotypical D&D style dialogue which makes me want to shoot myself and insults fantasy as a genre. Because there is no character development you find yourselves reading about complete strangers who you have no idea where they came from, why they are doing what they are doing, and quite frankly I find myself thinking, do I care if this person lives or dies? There are even some characters in the story which seem to have no purpose at all but to simply exist! What you are left with are hollow empty shells for character who you have no idea who they are or what they are doing.<br /><br />Secondly the plot is so convoluted and jumps from one character to character, and jumps years into the future with some chapters that I have absolutely no idea what is happening or why I even care. Almost, in fact no parts of the book I recall, take any time to explain in dept who these people are, what they look like, any history of the book, or mechanics of the use of magic. The author wrote the book as if it was the third of fourth in a series and by that time you would be familiar with the attributes of the setting and characters. What you are left thinking is, what is the central plot? Who is the main antagonist and protagonist? Do I care? The writing style was also very poor, I had any easier time understanding and reading Children of Huron. Many times I have questioned the grammatical correctness of about 50 percent of the book. The writing style only adds onto the frustration caused by the lack of character development, or any explanation of why I should give a rat's ass of whats going, if I could understand what was going on.<br /><br />Finally there are so many different kinds of magic, magic users, races, gods, magical entities, and the like that aren't explained that I find myself overwhelmed with no relief in the first 100 pages. I understand that explaining all the nitty gritty details so to speak in the first couple of chapters can slow down the book. But by the 100th pages, shouldn't some things be explained. In this book you have to infer a lot of things for yourself, and some more things than I care for are to enigmatic and ambiguous that you are left wondering, what the hell was that, thing, person, place, or thing? and why does it matter if its in the story or not?<br /><br />This books was so hard to read and get through that I finally decided to give up after the 112th page, I have no idea where this praise came from, or why anyone loves this series so much. I've read in other reviews that by the third or fourth book that almost everything is explained and that the central plot becomes evident. But if I'm not hooked by the first book? what would even be the point? I am not going to waste my time reading some incomprehensible piece of writing. I would would much rather spend my time re-reading the Wheel of Time Series.miliar with the attributes of the setting and characters. What you are left thinking is, what is the central plot?

1476715904|5.0|I think I'm learning that my new favorite book series may have to be Contemporary. Plus anything with a good love story... that's what I got with Slammed! It was a roller coaster of emotions that hit home for me. Tears fell hard in this story; hard because it hit an emotional string on my own heart that just brought me even closer to the story.<br /><br />Layken. I adore the name first off. What an adorable and unique name! She is our man gal this story. It's about her, her mom, and her brother. He dad has just recently past away and they are all starting to get over the grieving period. They move away from Texas to Michigan. They move in and have some really nice neighbors... Will... Mr. Cooper. I'd say every girls slight fantasy that if happened, may be heart breaking...<br /><br />Will. SWOON. Yet again. Always swoon worthy. 21, 3 years older then Layken... takes care of his 9 year old brother. His parents past away about 2 years prior to this story. Will was forced to double up on college, get a job, pay bills and take full responsibility of his brother. He became the provider. He grew up fast.<br /><br />When they meet... it's almost instant. It's a love story you have all read before. Boy meets girl, instant connection, wonderful date, perfect kiss. Then something comes along and ruins it. Completely flips things upside down and changes the WHOLE story. That's what I loved about this story. It was perfect and then the game changed. I was like NO!!! This can't be happening. I won't give anything away, I don't like when reviews give things away. I will just say things change, they don't go as I wanted throughout majority of the story. I was heartbroken throughout. Then things go down hill MORE. This is where I shed real tears. It hit a tender spot in my heart. I couldn't believe what I was reading. I cried probably until the end of the chapter. I was in shock. From there... well, you will just have to read Slammed to find out because if I write what I want to write, I may give something away.<br /><br />I loved Layken the most. She was so interesting. And Will with this slam poetry! I loved it. I liked that the guy wrote poetry and enjoyed that. It was different and made him special in my heart. I like it most when the guy isn't bad ass or covered in tattoos; those are nice, don't get me wrong! But... when the guy has real qualities, they seem more real to me and make me feel like those guys are possible out in this world I have to call reality.<br /><br />I read Slammed in a matter of two days. The moment I finished, I started Point of Retreat. I highly recommend this story. It's heartbreaking, emotional, unique, and causes you to truly think about love in a different life. This book is what I like to call real love. Yeah, maybe it's not instant like here, but what happens... that's LIFE. And if love can get through LIFE... you got a winner right there. Slammed is a winner.ite, I may give something away.<br /><br />I loved Layken the most. She was so interesting. And Will with this slam poetry! I loved it.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Of course this is wonderful.  I love Sandra Bullock and this movie is sooooooo good and heartfelt.  You can't go wrong with Sandra Bullock, one of her excellent ones.
0142418471|3.0|So… I’m not really sure what I want to say about this book. I liked it. It was different. Much different from what I have recently read! Definitely a change for me… but it was SO unique that I kept reading.<br /><br />It’s basically about two teenage boys, both with their own personal issues, that meet in the most random of spots. Both of which are named Will Grayson.<br /><br />Each chapter goes back and forth between the two boys. There is a clear difference between the actual text so you can tell who is who.<br /><br />I like both boys. They are both rather different. I’ll tell you this. One boy is gay and depressed. The other… he has something, but I’m not sure exactly what… just seems to be shy. He has a very different friend named Tiny, who is gay and rather large and loud and proud and I love him dearly!<br /><br />Both Will Grayson boys are very different, with their own stories that are very interesting. I like them equally! And I adore the fact that once they meet… their lives come together and everything kind of intertwines. This was a very unique and different story.<br /><br />Overall… I liked this story. It had a rough start for me. I wasn’t exactly pulled in instantly but I liked the text and the characters enough to keep going. Things finally picked up and became easy to keep going once the boys meet. I’d say read it. The characters are unique and different and relatable… Story is good but the characters are so different, I didn’t care what the story was! ☺<br /><br />Good summer read. It’s worth the read! Unique characters with an added musical ☺

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|While I enjoyed the first person perspective (FPP) in the first book and found it to still be mostly engaging in the second book, I found it intolerable in Mockingjay.  It's hard to specify anything more without giving out spoilers, but at this point in the novel the FPP that kept the first book suspenseful now becomes a source of frustration due to the direction they take Katniss.<br /><br />Also, not sure why everyone was so shocked about the ending.  Thought it fit well with the characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cool game to short<br />Only reason I rated 4 stars and not 5 was length. Was stumped a few times. Enjoyed this game. Need longer games for kindle.
0307271080|4.0|Go take a second and check out the quotes selected by GoodReads.com for Americanah. Hit CTRL-F and type \\"race.\\"<br /><br />In the collection of nearly 600 words, you'll get no hits (ok, one for \\"racial\\"). Which is surprising, considering that this book scatters the word as prolifically as salt over a shoulder. As well it should, featuring a Nigerian-born, USA-dwelling protagonist named Ifemelu whose primary source of income is a blog about race. Grasp your pearls and shield your testicles, because here comes some words by author Adichie that directly address the taboo topic:<br /><br />\\"You can't write an honest novel about race in this country. If you write about how people are really affected by race, it'll be too *obvious.* Black writers who do literary fiction in this country...have two choices: they can do precious or they can do pretentious. When you do neither, nobody knows what to do with you. So if you're going to write about race, you have to make sure it's so lyrical and subtle that the reader who doesn't read between the lines won't even know it's about race. You know, a Proustian meditation, all watery and fuzzy, that at the end just leaves you feeling watery and fuzzy.\\"<br /><br />The quote comes from Shan, sister of Ifemelu's AB boyfriend Blain (in Ifemelu's blogging shorthand, this stands for \\"American Born\\" Black--as opposed to an NAB, \\"Not American Born\\" Black). Shan is the naked conscience of the author, running undisguised defense on Adichie's behalf.<br /><br />Later, Shan also points out that Ifemelu's blog about race in the USA is only possible because Ifemelu is not actually part of the American Black experience; she is an outsider, and can therefore observe and comment with impunity. Ifemelu is cowed--even though one of her blog posts boldly explains to expat Africans and Islanders that once they land in the US \\"You are Black, baby.\\" Ifemelu feels that having racial expectations imposed on one in the USA makes one part of the American Black experience; but she swallows her anger and mildly agrees that the observation is fair to avoid conflict--and in that moment, Ifemelu's understanding of her own experience is co-opted; and though the moment is very dry and brainy and meta, it brought about an epiphany of empathy within me.<br /><br />Though Adichie tries to preempt all possible avenues readers might have for dismissing her observations on race repeatedly throughout the novel, Shan is the mouthpiece with the least to hide; charismatic and critical, prone to emotional breakdowns, and impossible to please, Shan is both the external reviewer and Adichie's internal critic. What's more, aside from being a clever literary device, Shan is TREAL. I've known her. At my most pretentious and vulnerable, I've been her. And she represents everything that is satisfying about Americanah... the double-entendre that is in constant effect; the play between the subtle and the barbarically blatant; the life of the mind and the life of the body.<br /><br />Despite my emphasis on the word, this book is not only about race, though it never shies from it. Americanah is foremost a love story... about the love of ideas. Of place, culture, tradition, societal expectations, and how moving forward doesn't necessarily mean leaving everything behind: a concept that calls to mind the Akan axiom/symbol Sankofa (\\"go back and fetch it,\\" meaning one should bring forward into ones' life all good things from the past), and a sentiment that is echoed in the sometimes disorienting structure of the novel, which tumbles back and forth through time, space, and character POV. Though the structure of the story may seem to have little regard for the footsteps involved in a journey, Adichie creates a rhythmless flow that is driven by meaning. In the end, we understand that Ifemelu and Obinze are a metaphor for the Westernization of Nigeria; or maybe it's the other way around--but either way, Adichie sees hope for the future, and she passes it forward off the page.ard off the page.

B007THA4FI|1.0|While I knew this book was written for adults, I though JK Rowling really failed.  The story line is non existent, especially given what a great storyteller the author is.  The story is really just a loose character development with gratuitous sex, bad language and random violence thrown in, I suppose to make it &#34;adult&#34;.  I repeatedly put this book down, not really caring what happened next.

0812977246|5.0|A great mystery novel written in the begging of the 80s of the last century. The plot is so good alone but what sets it apart from other books is the setting - Moscow some 15 years before the end of communist rule. Martin Cruz Smith took his time to understand some of the Russian spirit and the communism mechanisms and it is all very well woven into the story of one policeman's quest for truth and justice. The book is not so new so there even might be some better mystery novels since - but not many!<br />Make sure you will enjoy the peeling of layers and layers of plots and characters until the end and you will get to understand some of the atmosphere of the former USSR in a non-offensive manner (so characteristic of that era and of American writers almost in general when it comes to some countries). People are people everywhere, crime is crime - no matter what the ideology around and behind it and Martin Cruz Smith did a great job showing &#34;the other side&#34;<br />Most enjoyable book!<br /><br />PS I am trying not to say anything about the plot itself because it would truly be a spoiler - just read the book and you will love it...
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|What I wanted to know was how to complete certain levels not general or basic information on how to play the game.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|this was out when I was expecting and I didn't get a chance to watch it until now. I especially liked trying to figure out where in Atlanta the scenes were filmed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched the show first and didn't really think the book would be worth reading. WRONG! Awesome book definitely worth reading.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Sound is great and simple to set up.  I am able to record old albums and copy to my pc.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great read. Whether you have watched the show or not this is a must read. The books are much better than the show. Read this.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great case, great price.  The best part is that I can now stand my phone up to watch videos!  Clear case looks really nice.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is a must read! Forget the show, this book makes the third season look weak. Read this book.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|A haunting book, for sure. It was recommended by a friend and chosen for book club. A story about a mother and son; and finding courage and strength in terrifying situation. I'm hyper aware of abductions after reading this. As well as in awe of the mothers ability to keep things \\"normal\\" for her child. Good book. I won't forget this one for a long time
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|The game is fun but some of the sound effects are annoying, such as the sounds of children yelling &quot;yeah!!!!&quot;
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Initial connection and audio were not good. But in time both improved and I was able to watch the movie from start to finish.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Solve player is ok . The build your deck feature is cool but that's limited too I'm sure it's great on a system though. What bothers me is the multiplayer. Why do  I have to connect via blue tooth what is this a game boy? I should be able to play with people on line that wad whole purpose to this if I wanted to sit next to the person I'd carry my own deck
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is definitely an amazing read. Tina Fey is incredibly funny, and this is more proof. Just AMAZING is all I can say.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie keeps my three year old entertained for about twenty to thirty minutes, which is a lot for him!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I don't know where to start about Spirited Away. This film is brilliant in so many ways that it leaves me speechless when I try to mull over it. The art direction is fanciful and elegant, such that you feel totally engrossed in Chihiro's fantastic world. The landscapes are portrayed beautifully and they enchantingly compliment the nature of the scenes they are juxtaposing. The music is utterly fantastic as well; just listen to One Summer's Day and you'll see what I'm talking about. The soundtrack only helps to pull you into the world that Hayao Miyazaki has created. And lastly.. the characters are all captivating and charming in their own unique ways. From the stout frog employees of the bath house who are constantly filled with urgency to the body-less shadowy masked figure No-Face, every character has something to contribute to the story.<br /><br />I'm not even going to touch on the plot, because it is so amazing and unbelievable that it can't be accurately described in words. Please, watch this film.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|These days it seems like horror filmmakers are damned if they do and damned if they don't. The fans hate remakes but when they get original films, they refuse to support them over arbitrary reasons like ratings or a lack of blood. PG-13 or not, I made sure to get myself to the theater to see and support this and I wasn't at all disappointed. MAMA had an interesting story, impressive acting and a visually striking supernatural antagonist. There were definitely elements of Asian horror on display in this film, though MAMA relies a bit too much on CG. Thankfully the CG was animated relatively well so if you're willing to look beyond that and allow yourself to be swept up in the tension, MAMA is effective.<br /><br />Sure, it won't be for everybody, and for fans of films like INSIDIOUS, SINISTER and THE CONJURING it may come off a bit lightweight but it was entertaining and, in my opinion, worth checking out. MAMA isn't amazing and just can't be considered a classic by any stretch of the word but it does the job.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Definitely a game you have to play. It is an easy game. It is also very fun and very addictive!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Enthralled with the story. What a unique man. Dylan doesn't even come close. Too bad he was overlooked. His CD's are fabulous!!
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Amazing cast, locations, direction, cinematography. Really--it's hard to review a movie which is so deservedly a classic. Absolutely perfect movie.
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|The acting was superb!  The story was very well done. Just refreshing.  Clint/Amy/Justin hit a home run with this film.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|MINI REVIEW: a wonderful, child friendly film that ties itself to the 1939 WIZARD OF OZ film as well as the novels by L. Frank Baum. This visual feast for the eyes focuses upon the origins of the Wizard of Oz and how he came to rule the Emerald City. The characters and story plotting were surprisingly well done even if not perfect. Starring James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, Bruce Williams, Tony Cox and Michelle Williams. Special nod to Joey King who voiced the China Doll character. It did well at the Box Office and a sequel is thus expected. OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: B plus to A minus.
B00785P2QC|4.0|you build your city up its like farmvile its addicting. its like your a God u control what happen and doesn'thappen
B00947N6UG|5.0|I am happy to give this movie 5 stars, as all the kids loved it (even me).  We've watched it together several times this Summer, and I see it being a regular on the 'Movie Night&#34; rotation.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this. I play with my gf all the time. I can't Seem to get anyone else to play with me. But I'm trying. And I really  like this game.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Movie is great.  I love that you get the Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital copy in this pack.  I've been very impressed with Ultraviolet.
159463176X|5.0|He's one of te best! It's not as stressful to read as his others two books, but still a page turner.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book has an innovative structure (set up as oral history) and some pretty breathtaking moments (in which humans realize the enemy is nothing like themselves). But It can get a little repetitive in parts. If you're a zombie diehard like me, however, it's definitely a must for the summer. And it will be rewarding even if you've seen the movie -- because the movie is *nothing* like the book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoybpuzzels so got this. If you can't figure it out, Google a level. I do not like the adds and constant bugging to rate it. So, I'm rating.
B006T9PI5I|4.0|As a kid I loved this movie, and my seven and nine year old sons enjoyed it with me this time, despite being a little dated visually, it is fun.  The story is simple enough to follow, but has WWII references that we had to explain.  It brushes the concepts of a scam, bravery in the face of fearful unknown, confidence, honesty, patriotism, and optimism mixed with mid-20th Century Disney magic and live actors interacting with Cartoons.<br /><br />It's not a &#34;Classic&#34;. I wouldn't put it in the category of Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Peter Pan, or the Sound of Music, probably more on par with Roger Rabbit or The Mask.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I love that I am able to actually do stuff a real horse can do and take care of it like a real one.
141659521X|2.0|I've been a long time fan of the Mitch Rapp series, but this book lacked in many ways.  I don't want to spoil it, but just wanted to leave my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Girl's the games are so excited to be a treat the rest assured of the games for free download and install it on the answer to that a treat the answer is UHH XXX E is a treat for the first to play the game and I have been a chance for kindle fire
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|A bit hard to follow at times, but the ending was of the best tv/movie endings that I have seen.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|The picture is amazing but there is a glitch with when you go to the channel option<br />Because it shows the channels above what ever you were last on.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|WOW...what can you say about this CD??  It has ALL of the elements of an established R&B artist at his BEST.  Joe has been so under-rated that it's criminal.  All the tracks from start to finish are great, and if you're fortunate enough to have a copy with the added **BONUS** tracks then you'll be in for an exceptional treat.  Joe's lyrics are always relevant and on point.  Even though the whole CD is jammin, I especially like the title track \\"Doubleback\\" and \\"Mary Jane\\".  This is definitely GROWN FOLKS music.  Since I've purchased JOE, that's all I'm listening to right now as far as R&B.  It's a good Summer CD.  I definitely recommend this CD for your collection, especially if you're a JOE fan.  Simply one of his BEST.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|I still love the first few paragraphs of this book.  Classic Hemingway and in my Top 10 books of all time, along with two other Hemingway novels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning to the end. I didn't figure out the ending in the middle of the story. Loved the characters and the story line. I look forward to reading another book by this author.
B005EHQGTS|2.0|kinda bummed I can't access my second monitor and the resolution is kinda off. for a different set up this may be great but for me I'll have to pass.
B0037W68F4|3.0|I would give the album itself five stars. I like it a lot more than oracular spectacular. However, the packing was not as I expected. I expected it to be in a plastic case and it came in a flimsy paper case. I bought this as a CD and not an MP3 so that I could have the physical cd case, but all I got was a paper sleeve.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Deleted off my kindle could not get it to do anytthing so to save hassle  got rid of it pronto
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z was not anything like I expected. Instead of a cookie-cutter novel about a zombie outbreak, something that more than overdone nowadays, World War Z is a collection of interviews, stories from the people that survived disaster. Every interview is a piece of the puzzle, which paints an almost creepy picture of how each part of the World responded, and how some parts eventually survived, how others did not.<br />Fantastic read!
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I must say, I also hesitated about seeing this movie because they always seem to destroy the authenticity of the original.  BRAVO!!!!!!!! WELL DONE!!!!!!!  I loved it and was extremely impressed with the story.  The gore was definitely there and that's something I have not seen since the 80's which to me was the DECADE OF HORROR FILMS.  Can't wait to purchase my DVD even though I saw it in the movies.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am usually not a follower of the zombie trend but I did like this book by Max Brooks. The oral history taken from survivors all over the world speaks to the very nature of war whether zombie or human. The narrative really addresses the individual hardships, horror, and disbelief of what happened. The disbelief that such a thing could occur rings throughout all of the stories. To think that such a disaster involving a viral mutation is tough to comprehend but the author made it very believable. Well written and a good read.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I read what some would consider a lot. Fifty plus books a year. Of the books I read about seventy percent are non-fiction the rest are fiction. I often read books and think that they are good enough to read again and put them on the bookshelf for later. To be honest they do not make it off the shelf for a second read. Until now. I read Steven King's, On Writing in 2007 and placed it on the shelf. I just finished reading it again. Although the first time I read it I thought it was great the second time it was better. Now On Writing is back on the shelf for a third read at some undetermined point in the future. The book is full of sound practical writing advice as well as stories of an autobiographical nature. Most of the advice you can find other places. However, the mix of stories, advice and a look inside the mind of Steven King can really only be found in this book.<br /><br />* Highly recommended addition to any writer's or aspiring writer's library.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The sighting of vampires and werewolves caused some slight apprehension for me, but the story made up for any points lost there (by a longshot).<br /><br />With the exception of Alec, the author does a marvelous job of keeping all the characters relevant to the plot. Their characters are developed evenly, allowing for a realistic dynamic between the characters. As for Alec... eh, I still feel he's just there for his relationship (even after reading to book 5). Overall, the main cast each carry a distinctive role and likeable persona.<br /><br />At times I questioned some of the sexual banter (I swear we were told some of the characters were 15??), and even some of the character's mental awareness (Clarissa not being able to connect the dots about her father?????), yet the flaws in this book were all rather minor, and did not detract from my enjoyment and desire to continue the series.<br /><br />*Edit: Consider this a combined review for the first three books... just realized this was not book one
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have had this on my phone for ever, and have never got tired of it. Lots more to drive and lots more terrain to drive on.worth every cent except it's free.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This is an amazing book. It is a mix of happiness and sadness and action. It is an awesome prequel for the Maze Runner series.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|This movie will be the inspiration of many tween nerfball/gun video uploads to youtube.  As an action adventure film, it works very well. Get out the popcorn, beer, or whatever you rub into bellybutton, kick back on the sopha, and enjoy.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|really good show, lots of history and excitement.  Definitely hard to stop watching cause you want to see whats going to happen in the next episode.  I would recommend this for adult audience since there is some sexual scenes in it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is a show I would recommend to anyone looking for an intelligent show that can pull from many different genres. It certainly makes a show based around law far more entertaining than any of the previous ones I've watched. Both of the main characters are played well, and the script writing is witty and intelligent. Definitely an enjoyable show.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Jamie Fox is unexpectedly great in this movie, but the writing and the plot of this movie is what really makes it shine.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|My boyfriend and I love Boz Scaggs and we've seen him in concert a number of times.  This latest release from Boz is a little more mellow than some people are used to, but is a great listen.  Nobody has a voice like him!
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|This is a simple game with entertaining gameplay. The graphics are good you can zoom in and out and move the course around. The Pros: Nice graphics, and it is entertaing to figure out how to get the ships to their destination. Cons: All levels are similiar, once you finish a level you know exactly how it needs to be set up, so playing multiple times would get pretty boring.I think it was worth a try as the free app of the day but I would not pay for it because I will not want to play it over again after completing it the first time.
B0098460O4|4.0|Johnathon's voice is a diamond that just needs a gentle polish and Charlotte's is improving day by day.  They sound wonderful together and I am really glad I have the CD.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I kinda like the Birds but this one was really fun. I find it very interesting through seasons is a bit harder than you would expect. It has a couple gliches and you have to exit it at some points. Get the free version first then if you like it well.... Anyway, I hope this is helpful.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|These are a must have. What can you say it's all the Indiana Jones movies I grew up with. Quality packaging and outstanding price.
B000I186FW|5.0|I highly recommend this movie .... it's a lot more than just a movie... it's giving us a message ... wake up everybody ! it's not too far off from the truth !
B009FZHYKU|5.0|well nothing bad to say here. great episode just like the rest. can't wait till the next season comes out!
B0000CBHOI|5.0|Loved it! But its not just Martin Scorsese. Its actually 7 different films/directors (including Scorsese and one by Client Eastwood) with different looks at the blues. In any event great DVD (too bad its not available in Blu-ray) and get the separate  CD music set too.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I enjoyed this book. She takes you on a personal journey of what happened to her while she was clinically dead. I have read a lot of books on this subject and hers is not like others. You will have to evaluate this on your own.  I also saw her with Dwayne dyer and her discussion with him led me to get the book. Keep an open mind and enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is awesome keeps u busy for a while would recommend this too anyone who loves find and search games lots of these games are not as fun
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a page turning novel I couldn't put down. Simply stunning. The writing  was incredible. It was so personal. I loved this  book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is my first calculator on my Kindle HD. I had it for 4 months now and use it all the time. Nothing to complain about.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I had never played Mahjong before and have been totally surprised with how much I'm enjoying  the game. It could actually be addictive'
B009X01ELC|5.0|Actually I thought the elastic band might be a bit cheesy but it works without a hitch. It's substantially padded and allows for orientation whichever way you use it. It's securely attached and firm. I spent more on my wife's using a different brand, but I much prefer mine (this one). This is an excellent choice and I recommend this product.
B00B9366VO|5.0|As a musician, this documentary was inspiring and entertaining.  Dave Grohl is part of a dying breed of musicians.  Check it out.
0920236162|5.0|I have loved this book since I was a little girl, when my mother read it to me. I was tickled to rediscover it and share it with my 4 year old son and 7 year old daughter.<br /><br />The story is silly and entertaining enough to keep smaller children engaged, and interesting enough to discuss with older children. Princess Elizabeth is brave, determined, clever and, best of all, has a healthy dose of self-respect. She is a fantastic role model for all children.<br /><br />I love the ending, and its message that \\"happily ever after\\" can mean very different things to different people.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Five stars all the way! The Hunger Games is an amazing novel that makes you turn each page with excitement . I can't wait to read the other books.  : ) ;)
B0083Z614S|5.0|I never read this nook as a child but I simply could not have enjoyed it more as an adult. A beautiful story of rebirth and transformation.  So many lessons in one story.
B004K58GSO|5.0|I LIKE THIS JOHN WAYNE MOVIE FIRST BECAUSE I AM A BIG JOHN WAYNE FAN .AND I REALY LIKE THE CHARACTER MISSISSIPPI PLAYED JAMES CAAN
B000J4AOYE|5.0|Enjoyed this fun read!  It helped pass the time for my uncle who was in the hospital.  Highly recommend this!
B00821OX98|4.0|When it first started it looked boring. People walking around looking for guns and food and that was it. Plot starting to thicken and keep our interest!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I'm almost ashamed that I got this for free on an Amazon special promo of the day. [Don't tell the publisher, but I'd be glad to pay for it! -- ;-)  ] This tight little app has a clean, simple interface that has enabled me to browse around my tablet's files from my PC much faster than hooking it up via a hard wire connection. If you move files to/from your tablet to /from your PC, then get this app!  It's great!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I am glad I did not spend the money to see this in a movie theater. It was okay, and predictable .
B004SDSSFY|2.0|It displays (for viewin) Office files quite well. However, here's the problem I just sent to their tech support:<br />&#34;When I am in editing mode I need to select text before I delete, copy, paste, etc. - - Currently when I enter &#34;select&#34; mode, the two arrows appear and have already &#34;preselected&#34; a word in the block of text I am trying to edit. I cannot move either of these arrows to include more text or to highlight less text. The arrows simply do not respond to my touch. All other controls & menus respond properly...I am using an Asus Transformer 101 (Ice Cream Sandwich) which runs almost everything else flawlessly. What's going on?&#34;<br /><br />Their Tech Support's quick (next day) reply: &#34;I would first recommend restarting both the application and device and then trying to edit the text again. Is this problem occurring across all files you try to edit? If it is one specific file, we will gladly take a look at it on one of our devices if you would like to send it so we can try to correct the problem. Please let me know.&#34;<br /><br />My response to them:  &#34;I've tried restarting (full shutdown) & making sure the first and only app running is Documents to Go. I am locked out of adjusting the selection arrows on all Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files I've tried. After entering the select mode, I get one touch of the screen only. The arrows are then locked in place, immovable. Hope you can find a solution because the app displays the documents beautifully and I would love to be able to work with it.&#34;<br /><br />Current status as of 7/17/2013: I'll keep the app and hope they get back to me with something that fixes the problem. It does have a great &#34;look and feel.&#34;
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|This book was a bit abrupt at the end but it was great and was more than I expected. I advise all scholars that have to read this as a summer reading book to read it and enjoy it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|When each chapter started, I didn't know who they were talking about until I read a few pages.  Very disconcerting.  Otherwise I enjoyed he book but not as much as the Kite Runner.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Was great had a lot of bonus material.  Defiantly worth getting if you enjoyed the movie in theaters.  GET IT
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Our 5 year old twins and our 7 year old enjoy this game because it is the closest to &#34;real&#34; make-up in their eyes.  It's sad that you have to purchase new levels and options, which we will not, but it is fun nevertheless.
B000O77QD8|5.0|Was great in High Definition.  This was much better than I expected. This also had a lot of bonus matirila
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I am not sure if they aren't doing this right or not, but the cutting seems a bit off. It's either bald or wild looking. I'm still figuring this one out.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|The streaming quality was very good. Despite Tom not fitting the size of Reacher I think you can tell he loves the Reacher series. The movie was better then I thought it would have been since they changed so many parts compared to the book. I thought the casting was well done I would have liked the book ending but the ending was still solid to me. I hope Tom will be able to make another Reacher movie since the book series is a fun read. If you just want an action movie with a nice story and a strange character then you should give this a try as it will take you away from your life for a couple of hours of fun.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I am not that fan of musicals, but the production and the artist quality is awesome. Additionally, the history is unbeatable with a touch of French Revolution. Very nice entertainment.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is fun and I like it a lot more than one friend you can have more things<br />For more information about how you can have a awesome time with games<br />Like me on facebook Clara Phelps
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Excellent read! A page burner must have. The tech, science, drama and suspense draw you in until the very end. One of my fav authors to date. Thank you Mr. Rollins for the ride of a lifetime or lifetimes;)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very interesting story line. I had a hard time putting it down. Easy read and finished reading it within a couple days.
B004ZJZQ7O|1.0|I purchased this movie as we are Denzel fans. Was very excited to see this in Blu-ray for the first time, but very quickly realized the first Blu-ray sent to me did not work in any of our Blu-ray players. I Requested a exchange and the second Blu-ray failed in my LG 3D Blu-ray player but worked in our regular Blu-ray player.  I contacted LG and according to them my Blu-ray player should play all Blu-rays. My Blu-ray players are all updated with the latest firmware and are zone 1 and all zone compatible. This is the first time I have had a Blu-ray not work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome<br />Safe for kids<br />The minions funny<br />That is only a couple of reasons why i have fun playing  this game
0156027321|4.0|Delightful. Everytime I go over this book in my mind I find these extraneous pieces of information that only fit when you've completed the book. The book is certainly no mystery.<br /><br />It only takes 96 pages before Pi is stranded at sea. And 180 pages of it locked into a compromising situation with a Bengal Tiger. The first 100 feel like a primer on Indian culture and life on first read. But they lay a foundation. They make so much of Pi's later behavior believable.<br /><br />And the last 20 pages? You're no longer sure which story to believe. Both are plausible. Both incredible. Only one took ten times as many pages to write.<br /><br />Outstanding.
0790742780|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who has experienced the loss of job and what can happen to a person when the &#34;snowball affect&#34; starts to play out.  WOW!
B00CBRADU2|5.0|I could not find anything in this movie to dislike. It the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie yet. I Loved the old lady setting in her shop and what she dose to help out, and the look on Arnold's face was priceless.Why it did not get better reviews when it was at the movies is a shame.
B004VRL4AS|5.0|.I'm hooked on Primeval, the first series.  Love the characters and the story lines.  Primeval:  New World does not quite do it for me, but the writing is good.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|This backhoe is the most appreciated toy my son has ever received!  Gave it as gift for 3rd bday.  He uses it daily, both inside and out at the sandbox.  It's small enough for him to move around easily yet big enough to really move sand.  We have a small collection of Bruder toys now and I highly recommend them.  It's well worth it to spend a little more and get a really good toy...quality over quantity.
B004PGO25O|5.0|5 stars because it is a work of brilliance. I like it because of its blunt honesty and would recommend that everybody from the unemployed homeless to over-worked physicians and physicists read it - at least TWICE.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It really has a lot of vibrant colors to it, but I really didn't get it, so i deleted.  My daughter (26) has on her phone and loves it, so maybe it's a generation thing, LOL.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The book had an unexpected twist in the story, which I loved. The photographs really give life to the story itself. Really looking forward to read more about the adventures the peculiar will have.
B000002KHH|5.0|It's hard for me to say because I could rate any of their first six as the best ever on any given day but this is truly a masterpiece from start to finish. Not one bad song on the album! If you've never heard old Black Sabbath then this is as good a place as any to start. My favorite include Planet Caravan, War Pigs, Paranoid, Fairies Wear Boots. Hell, they're all great!!! This one will live on forever as one of the all time greats.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun game. Passes time. I love animals so this is perfect for me. horses r cool. ok bye bye bye
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Finally a Super-Man movie that gives me Goosebumps. I honestly can't wait to get my hands on this movie. If you don't like action-packed movies then this is not for you. If you don't like sci-fi this will give you a change at heart. There are some negative reviews and comments about this movie and trust me I've read and watched a ton of them. Some said it had too much action...uh it's a comic book movie based on one of greatest of all time. I mean do you want a superman that saves kittens out of trees lol. Some didn't like the movie at all because Super-Man is now wearing his underwear under his pants...I know right. One person said it was boring, and no its not again I've seen it 4 times. And some have seen it 9 or more it really is that good. However I will agree on something, the character development. I'll admit that some of the other characters didn't matter all that much but who cares read the title of the movie that's what its all about. I love where this movie went, I mean comic books every so often are reinvented. Change is good. The beginning is beautiful, the middle is exhilarating, and the end as in the very end is awesome. Get this movie its worth the buy. If you're skeptical rent it for a $1.50 when it hits Redbox. P.S. I went straight to the gym after watching this film to get my Henry Cavill on:)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids enjoy it so much. Keeps them busy for a good minute. They fight for who's turn it is. Very good way to keep them entertained while I do things around the house.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I just received this item in the mail today and I have to say it is amazing.  It is really cute and very easy to assemble. I put my 15 month old in it for a little test drive and he loves it.  We are going riding tomorrow and I feel more secure with him right in front of me than behind me.  My neighbor saw it and she will be getting one too.  :-)

B000SEI230|4.0|I didn't like this book at first but as I got into the story line I really found a beautiful story as well as a lovely lesson for life.  Be prepared to find your eyes tearing up as you read it.  I considered giving this a five star rating and probably should have.  Nicholas Sparks is truly a masterful author.  It's a beautifulul read.  Enjoy!

1451627297|5.0|I'm not necessarily a Stephen King fan but I really loved this book.  It was not typical, as in NOT scary.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This movie portrays man inhumanity to man.  Based on a true story, is not for the weak at heart.  The title role is superbly play by Adrien Brody who brings you into his character's life, his fears, his loses, his heartbreaks, and, in spite of it all, his determination to survive.  When all hope of surviving seem to have banished, he encounters a kind-hearted, sympathetic German officer. The suspenseful encounter between hated Jew and tyrannical German Officer leads viewer to think that the end has come for the resolute pianist, and yet, among man inhumanity to man, a feared killer brings hope and sustenance to the &#34;enemy&#34; and helps to insure his survival.  The movie is not for the squeamish, but it is a historical, classical movie that, in my opinion, will never be outdated.

B008JFUMHE|2.0|When a magician performs a trick, it has to work perfectly. We have to trust we've been shown everything that the magician is doing in order for the trick to leave us stunned. When a talented magician fumbles a part of a trick, we usually don't notice unless he stops and informs us of that. When a team of magicians performs a trick, the need for accuracy increases exponentially. Since Now You See Me is structured like a high-level magic trick, it's hard to know exactly what goes wrong.<br /><br /> David Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), all talented amateur magicians, find mysterious tarot cards inside their performance equipment. When they meet at the address on the back of the tarot they presumably receive some sort of instruction, because after the title card they're known as \\"The Four Horsemen\\" and they're playing a packed stadium show in Las Vegas.<br />They bring a volunteer on stage and have him rob a bank on the other side of the world. This sequence is shot remarkably, easily and effectively conveying the excitement of big, live magic. And it appears they actually did rob the bank, which of course gains them a spot on the FBI's and Interpol's most wanted lists. Their interrogation at the hands of Agent Rhodes (Mark Rufallo) is a much more intimate affair, but it's just as exciting as the grand magic show. During the interrogation, these characters are fantastically interesting, and we can't wait to spend the rest of this movie with them. But it's all an illusion. After their interrogation, the magic nearly dies, and the magicians behind the camera lose focus. In this trick, though, the problem is not the perfectly shuffled deck of leading characters. They are cast perfectly and they work very well together. The fault is that of one of the magicians.<br /><br /> Is it the director? Louis Leterrier has proven himself adept with action with the first two Transporter movies and The Incredible Hulk. When action takes to the screen, it shines. One scrape between Jack Wilder and Agent Rhodes showcases Jack's talents as an illusionist, and produces one of the most exciting and dynamic fight scenes ever filmed. But when we need to get closer what this movie is actually about, he doesn't quite know where to put us.<br /><br /> Could it be the screenwriters? Newcomer Edward Ricourt is credited with the story, as is Boaz Yakin (Prince of Persia). Ed Solomon (Men in Black) joined them to write the screenplay. It's not difficult to imagine these men embroiled in a tug-of-war over what is most important, or necessary at all, to the story. By the time we reach New Orleans and the Horsemen have robbed their benefactor (Michael Caine) who, abra-cadabra, owns an insurance company that didn't pay victims of hurricane Katrina and has a rivalry with a magic-debunking genius (Morgan Freeman), who is working with Agent Rhodes, who has fallen in love with the Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent), there are already way too many plot holes and unnecessary distractions than the movie could ever hope to explain.<br /><br /> But of course all of this buildup is leading to a grand flourish or huge twist that none of us saw coming, right? It does. A very surprising, but unfortunately completely unsatisfying one. Almost as surprising and unsatisfying as closing with this: \\"Despite all that, it's actually a great movie. Everything was in service of a brilliant, satisfying, totally necessary and believable conclusion.\\"<br /><br />  If that were the case, this review would end up just like the movie: nonsensical, intentionally misleading and entirely uncalled for.nd The Incredible Hulk.

B0055S348W|3.0|It is definitely a good application, but it needs to improve the UI. Adapt it to the Android Design Guidelines, and I will give you 5 stars.
0307951154|4.0|and I really enjoy his books.  I love books that give you the complete picture<br />of the area, the characters and the customs of the area, as well as a<br />mental visual of all you are reading about.  In his Inspector Harry Hole<br />books, the character is a very complex and damaged man, but a brilliant<br />detective.  I sometimes wish that Harry would be able to overcome his<br />personal nightmares and rise above them, but as a whole, for a fascinating<br />book, it all works beautifully.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|i was never a fan of which direction they took Star Trek after Voyager and Deep Space Nine.  So i hver followed the new series much until i had the oppurtunity to watch it on Amazon Prime (Note: the plug for Amazon Prime). i watch much of the 4 seasons I think it was a real good series. In fact it deserved at least one more season. Season 4 seemed like they were cramming 2 season into 1
B00821PCJS|5.0|Definitely a must see! Its not predictable which is nice for a change. I watched first season in 3 days.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The CD arrived on time and is in excellent shape, no problems. Adele's voice is comparable to Barbra's and Celine's....who wouldn't love hearing her?
B002NHGG92|5.0|I almost cried when I watched the last couple episodes! :( I recommend this series for teens and up :p
B0045HCJRG|5.0|The movie arrived on time and in excellent condition. This movie is just plain fun. The acting is excellent and the premise is quirky and unique. This movie is excellent for the whole family.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Excellent selection of wonderful songs by beautiful ladies.  The only thing better is seeing them in person which I have also done.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a great game, it really shows the power of the kindle fire. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is fast and fun, and the game doesn't push too hard to get you to make in game purchases.<br /><br />If the game stutters, restart your kindle and try it again, it runsnlike butter on a kindle fire g1
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I was never into reading for enjoyment, but I read all 3 of these books in 2 weeks. (That's pretty fast for me considering I have 2 small children.) The Crossfire series is so interesting I never wanted to put my kindle down. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Someone recommended this app and I am so glad they did. Nice fun addicting game. Will recommend it to others.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Chimpact is a fun game for all ages. It provides enough challenge for my 11 year old, but yet easy enough for my 6 year old. I like the totem path that gives you a time challenge to beat. The chimp makes the kids laugj and the graphics are great for a free game.
B006DGOV9Q|1.0|I ordered this battery for my fiances phone which is a Galaxy S2. What I got was not the right battery. Its too long and not wide enough.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Rated on entertainment qualities and nothing else. it was a good and a fun movie. I enjoyed it. Looking forward to Red2.
0345529057|5.0|Very economical purchase.  Good story; just can't get through it fast enough to rent from the library (I actually did rent the first book from the library, but couldn't get through it fast enough and had to return it for the next person who had a hold on the book).
B001ROZIA0|5.0|really love Diane and John in this flick.  Actually this is one of my favorites of John.  Very cute and fun romantic comedy.  I highly recommend:)
B00A11AN6O|2.0|Amazon should allocate cloud space based on how much one purchases from them each year.  If that were the case I'd have a LOT more room.  As it stands now there are other services for less $ out there that integrate with Windows better than Amazon Cloud Drive.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Love this dvd.  All the actors really mesh well together.  Definitely one I would recommend for a date night flick!
B004FRX0MY|2.0|There are many other MP3 players on the market that are much more stable and reliable than Amazon's.  It's a shame Amazon can't get this more stable as my family only purchases music from Amazon and it'd be nice if streaming music was a lot more reliable.  As it stands I just download all the MP3s we buy and put them on my SD card.
B0052QXAEK|5.0|Really love this DVD, its actually one of my favorites.  The actors are pretty solid in their performances.  A must see:)
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I asked Rovio how my coarse network location enhances game play, but they don't want to tell me, so uninstalling.  Still don't understand why a non-geospacial game needs to know where I am.

B0095MVOMC|3.0|In spite of all the warnings about it being a Trojan I downloaded and tried it out.  Nothing popped on my antivirus.  It is an ok game, but it is not colorblind friendly.  The hint feature helps, but it still sucks the fun out of it.  Uninstalling.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I was already familiar with this outstanding series!  It did not disappoint and with the extra material provided with the complete boxed set this was an outstanding buy.
B000RLFJQ2|1.0|I don't care what he does - he can't do wrong in my book.  Comedy, drama, action - it doesn't appear that he cannot transform himself to fit any role.  I'd call that talent, skill, professionalism, ability, flexibility, too many positive adjectives to type here.<br /><br />I didn't even watch the on-line version but I did watch the movie nearer the time it was originally released.  I just remember that the movie never disappoints and it seems like he brings his co-actors into a higher state of performance.  Nothing really specific for you to latch on to in my remarks but talent is talent.  Period.<br /><br />Buy it, watch it, enjoy it, in that order  : )<br /><br />I bought it, couldn't watch it, couldn't enjoy it.  The first disc, with the movie on it, wouldn't play in any of my players - it wouldn't load or display anything.  Of course since I didn't open and try to watch it until after the refund period I got screwed on this purchase.  No refund, no movie.<br /><br />From now on, try every product you purchase from ANYWHERE within the first week...
B00COHAUD4|1.0|This was horrible concept and just overall  movie if i could have my money back i would demand it  this  movie was  the just aful

B005EHQGTS|2.0|I am still trying to get used to the experience offered by the product. The main issue that I am facing is the touch experience is not ideal. Scrolling specifically doesn't work even though they have a special scroll bar on the right.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie is just wonderful. The acting is amazing, they did a very nice job following the book and it was very enjoyable/moving to watch.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I just read this book on a whim and it turned out to be amazing. Nothing cheesy and not too childish, just really good. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones series.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This remote works great, with my camera. Easy to use and is well made unlike some of the cheaper remote I purchased. should have spent the money up front and purchased this remote first.
B004YW4L5K|2.0|I love this author, but this books was so incredibly slow moving that I didn't even finish it. I NEVER leave books unfinished, but this one was too grueling for me. Sad.

B005D4YOY6|5.0|Comfortable well designed footwear, I believe Newports are the signature model for Keen Shoes - in my opinion, best of the best.  Service experience (Amazon) is setting the standard of excellence  Very pleased overall..
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Was a little skeptical about this. I have used other remote access apps but they were always slow and choppy. This app is smooth and lag free, and it plays audio as well. A well made app. I got it for free but i would pay to have it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm so glad I got into these after the trilogy had been published because I don't know if I could have waited to read them separately. Loved the incredibly flawed, yet completely identifiable characters, and the author's ability to keep you guessing at what might be coming. It also ends in a very satisfying way. I don't know why it's considered Young Adult fiction, though. Perhaps that's what they call sci-fi novels that don't include excessive sex scenes? There certainly is violence that could be considered graphic and the vision of humanity and feeling of overall dystopia is something teens can relate to, but it's a thought-provoking series of novels that definitely has adult appeal.

1442359919|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this Stephen King book. Different but very good. I hope he does more like this! Worth the cost.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Very fun game for adults and children love the chimpanzees are the funniest it keeps the attention of my grandson who loves it
0762445262|4.0|I was surprised by the small size of the book, but I didn't really buy it for the book. I wanted the bat signal to be a night light for my kid, but it's not really bright enough for that task.<br /><br />Still, for the small cost, it is a toy he likes, and I'm satisfied.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love all the Twilight books! I've read series over and over! It seems I find something new every time I read it.

0425263908|2.0|I ordered this when I heard it was similar to Fifty Shades of Grey.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I wasn't impressed with this book.  I found the story somewhat boring.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I love Joe's sexy, sultry style. He knows how to woo a lady. The album is destined to become an all-night favorite.

B00B5P37IG|1.0|Does not meet expectations. Ok if you are looking for religious channels. Really not worth the .99 cents it cost.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Ok so not as horror based as Event Horizon, but if you are in the mood for an excellent well filmed and acted sci-fi film with a hint of horror and lots of outer space cinematographic goodness, then you'll like this movie. Well crafted, a surprising pace that sneaks up on you, this movie caught me by surprise. Enjoy
B000VK7KVQ|4.0|The movie is good investigation and base on the story in San Francisco Bay area in the 70's.I would recommend to person who like detective  and investigation movie.
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|As I stated in an earlier comment, this album is one of the worst disappointments Phil has ever released!!!  I saw Down twice last year and believe Pantera was the best Metal (at least thrash) Band of ALL time.  I'll stick with Anselmo til the end, BUT that is also why I have to comment about this album.  I listened to it 10+ times and if anything, it got worse and worse.  I'm VERY open-minded, especially with my favorite musicians, but there's NOTHING here!!!  I could make better riffs and lyrics! It almost sounds like some kids put crap together and somehow talked Anselmo into recording it!  There are NO grooves, riffs, structure or even decent lyrics...  I was extremely excited to hear this album and Phil really talked it up (of course).... well it did NOT live up to the hype!  Hate to say that this album is garbage and a waste of money....  MUCH worse than even Superjoint Ritual.  Phil NEEDS to get back with DOWN soon, because he obviously cannot be successful Solo!  Negative, but HONEST review from a PANTERA/DOWN Fan >: (
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Rooney Mara was her usual brooding, interesting self. Though moderately suspenseful in the beginning, the movie was always striving to be better than it was. Catherine Zeta-Jones gave a strange caricature performance. I would not recommend the movie.
B004FHCH96|5.0|This is one of Christopher Nolan's finest. If you enjoyed Inception you should definitely pick this movie up as well.
B002CIMKHO|5.0|Very typical very good Clint Eastwood movie. Bitter old man does good. Shows that if people stick together we can make a difference.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is sweet.. Fast pasted and full of action. Great to pass time with,  I can't get enough of it. Go challenge your friend.
0486278077|5.0|One of the most thought-provoking books I've read lately, mainly because of the many unconventional and incredible remarks made by Lord Henry and the effect it starts to have on the actions of Dorian Gray.<br /><br />Right from the moment Lord Henry meets Dorian at the studio of their common friend painter Basil Hallward, he starts inciting him towards prioritizing selfish sensory pleasures over and above everything else and prodding Dorian towards a new hedoism. In portraying the pleasure seeking life of Dorian Gray, the author also provides a detailed reflection of the English society in the times that the novel is set in, allowing the reader to delve especially into the lives of the upper class. I also got very fascinated with the fantastic parallel to the soul that Oscar Wilde draws - with the painting shaping automatically to express the effects of the immoral actions of Dorian. While Dorian stays young, the painting takes the likeness of how he would have been if he would have aged and if his true character would have shown on his face.<br /><br />The climax bring everything beautifully together with the soul (the painting) getting released in the same pure form that it started as, while the dead body lies in its real form with its age and ethos clearly showing through the withered, wrinkled and loathsome appearance
B000002J1O|5.0|Album arrived promptly and was in condition advertised. This may be the best album released by the classic Peter Gabriel-fronted lineup. Nice artwork. Album included a booklet with all lyrics and liner notes. This is a must-have for Genesis fans. If you're thinking of getting into Genesis, this would be a great album to start with.
B00BZAJMWG|3.0|It was worth watching she is cute and carries the show.<br />I think they really could have played up the bit between them more than just a couple of slaps.
B001O8C5EQ|5.0|The album arrived promptly and was shrink-wrapped and brand new as advertised. This is one of Porcupine Tree's best albums. A must-have for any fan. Also recommended for those interested in progressive rock music.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I feel that the characters in this story had great difficulty in self identity.  None seemed to be able to find the contentment that comes from knowing who you are.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everyone was watching this it seems but me  and I fought it all the way, finally I decided to watch the first two seasons<br />On Demand and that was it  I was hooked.  It wasn't a show I thought I'd love but I did. Highly recommend it.

B005LAII4E|1.0|There are films that ask you to accept the premise before going in. There are movies that ask you to accept certain plot elements though they don't make sense. There are movies that ask you to shut your mind off and just go with the idiocy going on on screen. And then there is GI Joe. Nothing makes sense in this film. Not a single solitary thing. There's really nothing more I can say about it. It isn't suspension of belief that this movie asks of you, but the utter ejection of your brain into a little jar which you might hopefully get back when you walk away. I'm sorry, I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. Once, a long time ago, I could. I still remember being very entertained by the first Transformers, so obviously suspension of belief to this level was possible for me at some time in my life, but I just can't do it anymore.<br /><br />The movie starts with a GI Joe par core fight scene, which I guess was supposed to be exiting but all I could thing about was The Office.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It really is that ridiculous. But to be fair, this is standard popcorn action stuff. I can forgive a movie its sins of over the top action, I have in the past, I will probably do it in the future. But the action in this movie never really excited me at any point. I can enjoy dumb action as much as the next guy (hell, I think I'm the only one in the world who liked Die Hard 4 after all), but GI Joe's was just too... Transformy. And not in the Transformer 1 kinda way, more like in the \\"what in the name of God is going on here?\\" Transformer's two kinda way. A small difference, I know, but even those who enjoy the first Transformers as a guilty pleasure want to rip our heads off at the idiocy that is the second movie. Transformers 1=stupid fun, while Transformers 2=\\" my God what did I just see?\\" That's pretty much how I felt at the end of this film. A lot of bullets are thrown around, a lot of explosions, and a lot of crazy over the top action slock. But just about everything in it defines all sense of logic and reason to the point where I think the movie was written by the special effects people instead of, well, you know, actual writers. Did Michael Bay do this movie? No? Well riddle me surprised.<br /><br />But it's not the crazy over the top action that does this movie in. Despite my bad mouthing it, there were a couple of scenes I have to admit were really freaking cool. No siry, it's the complete lack of sense. Spoilers follow, so if you care about such things, cover your virgin eyes. So Cobra's plan to take over the world is, upon installing one of his henchmen as the fake President, to assassinate the Joe's with a massive military strike against their base after framing them for the assassination of the Pakistani President after using them to steal all of Pakistan's nukes which are conveniently all located in one central location guarded by people wearing towels (and no, that's not a racist remark, one of the dudes is literally wearing a towel on his head). So they launch a massive strike against the Joes... and no one ever questions the logic behind this, asks why the attempt was never made to capture and try them, question the President's authority to straight up kill all the Joe's using (ahem) COBRA troops. Did none of the generals wonder who all those mysterious troops were? So once the Joe's are out of the way the next step in the plan is to gather together in one spot the leaders of every nuclear armed nation in the world in order to negotiate talks on nuclear disbarment. Once there he, launches his nukes at all of them? Okay, first off, North Korea is at these talks. What fantasy world is this? North Korea sitting down at the negotiating table to talk about nuclear disbarment? Balderdash! So the nations of the world respond by, launching every single nuke they have, AT EACH OTHER? Wait a minute, they weren't nuking each other, America was nuking them, why then would they nuke each other in response? So the fake President then destroys all his nukes with a magical button, an watches as all the other world leaders have similar magical buttons that destroy their nukes midair as well. But wait, what if one of them decided not to? What if, you know, North Korea or Iran decided, screw it, and let their missiles destroy America anyway? Then Cobra would be dead, and the whole plan would be for nothing. Yeah, way to go Cobra.<br /><br />END SPOILERS!<br />You see, no logic. There are so many plot holes in this movie it might as well be Swiss cheese. Nothing in this movie makes sense. There's a part where a character takes out a handful of grenades he was hiding in a fruit bowl, a FRUIT BOWL. Golly, sure hope he doesn't have any company over for dinner. Wouldn't want any kid finding a freaking grenade while looking for a banana. I haven't mentioned a quarter of the huge gaping holes in this movie, and I think just the ones I listed are pretty bad.<br /><br />The acting is adequate for this kind of movie though nothing special. The Rock puts in a fun performance, while everyone else is... well, there. Bruce Willis was an odd character. He didn't really do much, just sort of gave the Joe's their guns for the final battle and helped out a little bit in that battle, but he is more of an extended cameo then an actual character. I mean it's still Bruce Willis, so you know he's a cool guy,  but it seemed like a role they threw in there to give the movie a little extra star power it didn't have before.<br /><br />So in conclusion, GI Joe is Transformers 2. Is it better than the first? I don't know, as I've never seen the first. Is it entertaining in its own right? That all depends on the level of BS you can take before giving up on a movie. I was somewhat with this movie all the way up to the point where the villains revealed their master plan, at that point I couldn't take it anymore. It had reached levels of ridiculousness m fragile little mind could not take. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed all three Transformers movies, know they are capable of suspending belief in the rules of logic and reason for an entire movie, and want nothing more than to see big huge action scenes. If that's you, you'll like this movie, and more power to you. If not, I'd recommend saving your money.<br /><br />Replay value; low.dent then destroys all his nukes with a magical button, an watches as all the other world leaders have similar magical buttons that destroy their nukes midair as well.

B0027MJU00|3.0|Couldn't put it down......another good 1 when is the new book coming out?........I can't wait. I wonder what her religion is lol
0920668372|5.0|loved this book from when i was younger, so had to get for my new daughter's book collection!  wonderful read!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|A truly wonderful toy. I am a huge fan of Dr. Who. Tenant was my favorite, so naturally, I bought this sonic screwdriver. The fun that you have with it, is, impossible. First, let me note that I am 13 years old, and still I have fun with such little \\"useless\\" items. Ok, let me get the \\"useless\\" out of the way. Its not useless at all. I used it to win first place in a computer contest. Long story, but basically, I used the secret ink. Anyway, my robot made it in 22 seconds, and blah blah blah. Anyway, it comes with a \\"secret ink\\" pen. (WARNING: VISIBLE ON GLOSSED PAPER. I GAVE THE PEN TO MY FRIEND, AND HE WROTE ON A MAP, NEXT TO \\"ASIA;\\" IS STUPID AND POOR. BASICALLY, IT READ: ASIA IS STUPID AND POOR. YOU COULD SEE IT. Luckily, there is a way, somewhat disgusting, but works, to erase it. Simply use saliva) Anyway, there is also a pen nib. Another note, the pen nibs, after a day or so, come off REALLY easily, or they start wobbling a bit, and it doesn't feel too authentic. So, I decided that since I have a 40 dollar pen anyway, might as will just Crazy Glue the invisible pen in. It REALLY helped. Also, the little think that you use to extend the screwdriver comes off. You can't glue that, because underneath is a screw so you can open it and change the batteries. I just used some tape because it kept on coming off. Anyway, the light IS blue, even though the camera makes it look kind of purple. The light doesn't appear very well when there is a lot of additional light, but that's not that bad. The noise is REALLY cool. I once geeked out and watched an episode with the screwdriver in my hand, and the sound is identical. It's a little quiet, but that's all. You press the bottom button when it's not extended, and the top button when extended. The screwdriver itself feels really realistic, but it has a light toy feel, and that might be my only complaint. BUT, lemme tell you, you will not regret buying this. If you watch Dr. Who, you owe it to yourself to buy it. As a last note, DON'T try to use it on door locks, because it becomes addicting, and you start doing it everywhere, and it looks kind of weird. I still look like a little child, running about, \\"soonincing\\" everything. (just remember, I'm 13, so if you think your \\"grown up,\\" your wrong.<br />As a final note:<br />\\"DON'T DISS THE SONIC!\\" :)
0345803485|2.0|was sure i would love this book, but surprisingly i found it a bit dull.  couldn't really like the characters that much and probably had heard too much about it being soo great that i just didn't see it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|it was good enough so that i finished the book. Not good enough that it kept my interest so much that I could never put it down.  I wouldnt read it again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My five year old daughter is hooked and I'm amazed at how well she can solve these puzzles. I think it allows her to challenge her spatial awareness skills. When she gets stuck I step in and help her with a level. The free version has some nice challenges to it.
B004OZOTSQ|2.0|I don't get it - other apps (e.g. AirDroid) do everything this does and more for free. Why pay for this?
B003QTSMXE|5.0|A film that takes a harsh look at the future of humanity while still feeling fun and optimistic. I'm not usually a fan of animated films, but I loved waaaaaaaall-eee
1781162646|4.0|Joyland is a delicate concoction of layered, disparate plotlines that operate on multiple levels.  First, there is the coming-of-age story of Devin Jones, a college student in the early 1970's who is dealing with the loss of his first girlfriend, the burgeoning responsibilities of adulthood, a rebound summer romance, and a friendship with a terminally ill child. As always, King excels at this type of story, capturing the small-town feel of a bygone era and the curious brew of ambition, isolation, and optimism of early adulthood.<br /><br />On another level, the story is also an ode to the old-time circus/carny lifestyle.  These elements don't work as well; they come across saccharine-sweet and not terribly interesting or realistic. Sara Gruen covered this territory with more panache in Like Water for Elephants.<br /><br />There is an understated ghost story.  Although this aspect never fully comes into the foreground to become the main focus, it lends the tale a certain kind of atmosphere reminiscent of earlier novels like It and The Shining.  When you're reading it, you think to yourself,  Ah, yes, this is the Stephen King I remember...<br /><br />The final layer is the crime case, an unsolved four-year old murder and a serial killer possibly still at large.  I wouldn't characterize this as hard-boiled, or even noir, but this is the presumably the hook that interested Charles Adai at Hard Case Crime.<br /><br />The various elements of the plot coalesce into a unified whole that hangs together, more or less.  It wasn't perfect: A few passages felt slow, and a few others were forced.  However, by the end I still cared about the characters and was invested in their outcomes, which is the msot important thing.  It's not going to become a classic for either Stephen King or Hard Case Crime, but it accounted for several enjoyable and worthwhile hours.<br /><br />Joyland is Stephen King's 47th novel, and the 79th published by Hard Case Crime.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books they were interesting I would recommend this to anyone who likes love violence with some mystery
B007URVZJ6|3.0|A decent book on how to build up your ebook. It's good for starters. And is best if you write an all text book (no images or tables).
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game rocks, but needs a little improvement. It should be more like PC edition, with more stuff, animals, and better yet, the ability to change your skin. Then it would be more fun.
B005SAYRA6|5.0|This is a fun fast pace movie with lots of stunts, fast cars and great fight scenes. I will recommend this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It seem to freeze a little but once you get passed that it is great and fun not to mention adorable. They need a new game with part 2 with the villains and things from that movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun to play i love it only eight seven six five four three two words left
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a lot better than the older one. At least in this one you can choices which area you want to go to and you can walk in villages and graveyards it's just Awesome
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!!! My grandson and. I play it all the time and he really likes the different vehicles he could use.
B003F46RVO|4.0|This is one of my childhood favs.  This movie is classic 80s style. Corey Haim before all the trouble.  Thanks for the memories Corey.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome. I love this game!! I can play this game for hours! Better then the first one.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|performed by outstanding cast.The story line is pretty realistic, but of course adapted for a movie, but the final outcome is truly entertaining.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 began with a great &#34;hook&#34; and kept giving the viewer more to look forward to.  The characters have all evolved and grown/changed, emotionally and spiritually.  Some of this show's best acting, came out during the third season.  The viewer can feel the fearful tension, as the characters try to survive humans, more then surviving zombies.  This show gives the viewer a lot to think about......&#34;how would I survive a cataclysmic event&#34;, &#34;what would I do&#34;?........it really makes you wonder about one's own actions during a time like that.  The character of Carl, Rick's son, has changed and emotionally evolved, the most.  Becoming so cynical, with the &#34;it's him or me&#34; attitude, at such a young age, is both heartbreaking and breathtaking.  The actors ALL convey their emotions. without saying a word.....now, THAT is great acting.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|One of the great John Wayne classic movies. It is fun - has humor, romance, action and you can watch it with your grandkids.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is  suspenseful, witty, and fun. I was hooked from episode 1. Good acting and better than most prime time tv shows.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|If you would like to start exercising and your not sure what it takes then get this.  It will give you much to do and assist you in your journey.
B004BDDJN2|4.0|This was a mature role for Zac Efron that was well written for both him and his supporting cast. If you're a hopeless romantic than this movie is for you.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|We really loved the graphics and storyline.  My son has the X-box game and loves it so I knew the movie would be a hit.
B0055S348W|2.0|Not only is my printer not supported, the app can't even find it. It's a new printer and works fine over wifi with my laptop, so it's not the network, the computers, the phone, or the printer.<br /><br />I'll try it again if and when it's updated. Cool concept.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I didn' t realize when I downloaded the app that I would only be able to set three alarms before I would have to update my app.  I think it's a joke that Kindle Fire HD I have didn't even come with a clock and alarm.
B0016NF06O|5.0|Just what you would expect from these two...but what a marvelous surprise, the blending of these two styles.  Really so perfect together, one of my favorite collaborations!
0802473156|5.0|Great book that really articulates what people feel. I'm only a few chapters in, but it's great thus far. Would recommend to read this with your significant other together!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|You gotta love Neil Gaiman: he is imaginative and tells wonderful stories, but he is also a damn good writer.<br /><br />If you have ever had the crazy feeling that you have encountered a strange thing that, on reflection, you've actually known about all your life, something like coming home, something like a dream that you've had again and again, this book will resonate like Big Ben.  If not, well, read it anyway, because you'll enjoy the plucky characters and how they cope with the tough hand they are dealt.<br /><br />The middle-aged narrator recounts a tale from when he was seven.  It's not sentimental, but heroic.<br /><br />The book is on par with, perhaps even better than Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\".  Both novels are engaging and gripping, and written by someone who has exquisite command of English.

0156027321|2.0|The Life of Pi started irritating me from the get-go; how someone can insist that ALL religions are good and compatible always riles me. Can they not do the simplest of research and see the contradictions? The stupid statement about how Jesus is a prophet in Islam and some people say he's buried in Kashmir is not an argument for universality - if Christians claim him to be the word made flesh, he's not a prophet and he can't be buried! All it exposes us how superficial Pi's Christianity is! How can Pi reconcile his continued polytheistic Hindu faith when the statement of belief in Islam is there is no God but Allah? I wish I knew more if Hindu tenets just to see how Pi violates them.<br />I want to thank the multitude of reviewers in amazon, even if they did give away the ending. Ye have saved me time, and thank you to those of you who brought up Max and the Cats, a book I'm desperate to read now (and will be severely annoyed if it turns out to be a better book! That's the inferior copy gaining more attention than the original!) I didn't like my experience of Martel's other work, Beatrice and Virgil. I found him too self-absorbed as a writer (books are always from a writer's POV), and if the ultimate moral here is to make your own truth, then to follow this shallow \\"philosophy\\" is to embrace schizophrenic sadists - they are living their own truth, after all.
B00AEBB9K0|1.0|This DVD did not play on the DVD in Europe. There should have been information that advised that there were restrictions on where it would play
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|If you like to hear 1.5 hours of dysfunctional people yelling at each other then this might be for you. It is truly an awful movie with the occasional interesting scene don't see why folks have given it such high ratings, but then didn't like I heart Huckabees by this director either... Assuming you can get past the dysfunction the acting was pretty convincing and it was well made. I'd say more of a critics choice than real entertainment.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|OK, so it's not a real barrel of monkeys, but it's as close to practical as possible. The game play in non-threatening, safe for kiddies and a lot of fun for us adult kids. Not a time stress game, but one of total cuteness and fun. Enjoy this monkey business.
B003E88TKS|2.0|This whole movie centers around George Clooney who plays a corporate hatchet man<br />who travels around first class and fires people for bosses too weak to do it for<br />themselves. It is very slow, and painful watching loads of people getting fired.<br />Do yourselves a big favor and pass on this one, unless you're a big Clooney fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hey looks good I'm gonna download it and when I do I'm going to tell you guys how good it is
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is easy to use, bright and colorful. It's a good starter game and the price is right! I would recommend it to everyone.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Great cast! Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep never let me down. Funny and good glimpse into the world of high fashion
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Playing this game makes me feel like I really own a horse. I would advise people who like animals to download this load of nature
1250012570|5.0|Easy read, great for summertime.  It got really good and hard to put down about half way through.  I wish it was longer, because I think I read it in 5-7 sittings.  Regardless, it's a good book that isn't too \\"feel good\\" but also not a total downer.  Perfect for a beach/vacation read.
B000065V42|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out and now after seeing it all these years later I still love it! And since we have a Jack Russell Terrier - watching the dog in this movie makes it all the better!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|And I loved it.  It was a quick read, very interesting, and I didn't feel let down in the slightest.  Very different than than the movie with only a few connections, this book portrays a zombie war over 10 years but told entirely in retrospect through interviews.  I wouldn't say this filled in the gaps because the two were so different.  The book stands alone as a very enjoyable and unique perspective about war, a true world war.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|I wish we were given more control over the airplane an  more options in the menu, however as an arcade  landing simulator it is tons of fun. I really enjoy the photo realistic terrain!
B007XH6BPG|5.0|Squire and Hackett will make you believe that prog-rock is as good now as it once was when it began in the late 1960s-early 1970s.  They just have a natural chemistry, and the feel of the songs is a combination of the sounds of Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Who, and Yes/Genesis.  This recording is highly recommended for prog-rock fans.
B007VTVGFQ|4.0|I wasn't feeling it too much...until I went to see her concert and heard the songs live. Then I liked the cd a lot more.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this for my dad's birthday and he loves it!  Can't beat the price on Amazon, and it's an all around amazing collection! Highly recommend for anyone who likes  The Godfather movies.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Nice to see the &#34;older&#34; groups making new cd's, I think the kids of now could learn from the music we grew up with.
B002EWANQS|5.0|It is the conventional moka espresso but in electric system. The flavor resoult is perfect, just it is a litlle slowly, because is electric. Nothing wrong.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|A true story and so very touching.  Well acted, I even cried throughout and then would laugh.  Completely enjoyed it.  Would highly recommend!
B004LE7PCM|5.0|Of course I have read most of the books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle but the Sherlock Homes books have a special timeless quality.<br />The writing style and descriptive dialogue prompt images in the  mind which are not hazy but crystal clear.<br /><br />A Masterfull compilation.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its reallyeasy to pull up when you are stuck on a problem for school. I would recommend this app, its Easter than some if the others.
B005IZLPME|5.0|We are happy to have a dvd of this movie.  We haven't watched the 3d movie yet but the blu-ray copy is perfect.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I waited two years to read the second book of the series. I just didn't think it could be as good as the first and I didn't want to be disappointed. I finally decided to give it try--it had me riveted from start to finish and definitely was as good as the first book, in my opinion.
B009JZ5FO8|5.0|I gave this to several little girls attending my daughter's wedding.  They had fun all afternoon with them and they all made new friends.
0345529057|3.0|The first book I started reading by page 79 the pages started to fall out. I love the story but i should have bought hard cover.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. I find it better than iHeart Radio, because I can use Tune In to listen to Korean, Russian, British, and lots of other radio stations around the world, while iHeart Radio only lets you listen to local or national stations. You don't need to sign in or anything to search for stations or music. This app is amazing and all music lovers should have it.
B008220BP2|5.0|It's nice to finally see something different.  Who ever could of thought of a zombie romance.  The movie focuses more on the teenagers and being  pg-13 It doesn't have much gore like other zombie movies.  Hopefully there will be a sequel, I'd prefer a higher rating.  A sequel could focus on the inter mingling of zombies and humans or be a movie focusing on humans and zombies vs the bonies!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|It's a fun game but when you are playing on a phone, the tiles are kinda small and you have a tendency to hit the wrong tile which makes your time extend by a bit...
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Disjointed - too many characters and a complicated with too many generations that made it difficult to follow. Please simplify.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We had seen the last two seasons a while ago so it was great when the third season became available!  I loved the unexpected turns and twists of the plot throughout this season! A particular episode about the second daughter and what happened to her has sparked conversations with my own grown daughters concerning pregnancy.  I also appreciate the research which keenly reflects the historical representation of the characters' attitudes (and, of course, the sets).  It's delightful watching how those same tradition-laden attitudes are painstakingly 'evolving' because of the need to survive in an unforgiving modern world (of the 1920s).  Some of the lines, like those from the Dowager character, are hilarious!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome and any age can play and honestly I think  it's better  than temple run because they've. made a movie. and the minions are cute
B009LH1WLO|5.0|When Supernatural first came out I watched one episode and was like \\"nah\\". The CG was hokey, the monster-of-the-week plotline was predictable and the only saving grace was the interactions between the two Winchester brothers but it wasn't enough.<br /><br />Fastforward 8 years. A long weekend with nothing to watch and I see that the fist seven seasons are on netflix. With nothing better to do I decided to give it a shot. And OMG am I glad I did. The show has quickly become my all time favorite (sorry Buffy...). The first season left a lot to be desired, season two was an improvement,  by season three I was hooked and didn't want to do anything else. And don't even get me started on season 4!<br /><br />So the show improved, I marathoned through seven seasons and was suddenly left with nothing to do. I checked amazon and there was season 8, just waiting for me to watch it.<br /><br />Season 8: A fantastic season, much better than the one before. (Thanks Castiel, you make this show worth watching) And I feel like this season was in preparation of an even greater 9th season. The Winchester brothers are starting to show some character development (the first couple seasons they remained pretty stagnant but through this season their role in eachothers life seems to be developing). Dean is probably my all time favorite TV character, he's broken in all the right ways and would do anything for those he cared about.  The best episodes are clearly the ones that have to do with the over-arching plotline, but even the filler episodes are a blast (Charlie!!!). There are a few really heartbreaking episodes, the kind that leave you staring at the screen as the credits roll wondering why the writers would do this to you.<br /><br />Don't wait until you can watch it for free. Supernatural season 8 is worth buying now.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|This is a strange story told in a strange sequence.  Maybe if you read it in one go, it would be easier to follow.  The book does force you to consider what happens to animals caught up in &#34;experiments&#34; devised by man.  Where does society draw the line on what is right and wrong?  After you read this book, you may want to abolish all animal experimentation...on the other hand, you may justify it as a necessary evil for medical advancement.  Perhaps, there is no right answer.
B0083I90HU|5.0|Stayed into it so I could not stop reading until I found out about the child left behind. More surprises were to come.
1401324649|2.0|This is a mildly entertaining book.  It features a whole cast of unlikely characters and stars the most unlikely character of all..a 100 year old reincarnation of Forrest Gump!  Who knew he was Swedish???.  The story goes on and on with ever more unlikely plot twists and turns.  As I was reading this book, I kept hearing the song &#34;The Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly&#34; on endless tape in my head.  Like the song, the story repeats itself over and over endeavoring to keep those readers lost in the numerous flashbacks up to speed.  At last, the story ends and so does the song.  Neither is believable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it! Could play it for hours. Downloaded it just for the fact that the movie is adorable and the graffics of this game definitely does not disappoint!
B007HO392S|5.0|What a lovely Christian spirit with a voice so clear and beautiful.  The music is fresh and calls to the younger generation with ample association to us of the ole school crowd.  This young lady captured my attention when she chose to finish her University Studies before engaging in her career - I say, from experience, there are few with that much wisdom at such an early age.  God bless you and God bless Carrie Underwood.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Love this app, lots of things to look at.  Like looking for interesting videos.  Great variety and fun looking at all the different types of videos on there
B00CWVM1AC|4.0|Although not as good as the original movie it did segue well into the sequel. I did think it was much slower moving but liked the storyline that brought in the emotion of his dead lovers parents.  I feel the two movies could be edited together into one awesome movie.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book but not as much as The Kite Runner and A thousand Splendid Suns. It was good but not gripping.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I've watched the series sever times over the years and thoroughly enjoyed it. This time, I got my father to sit down with me and we did a season (and movie) marathon over the course of about a week and he loved it as well.
B005LAII4E|4.0|This movie is not that that bad. I've seen far worse. The first gi joe, 2fast 2furious, expendables 2 to name a few. Great action. A little strange how they work in the ninjas but hey what movie is worse by having ninjas in it? Hot girl (IMO) cool fight screens, and lots of awesome guns and thing that blow up! little corny in some parts but if you like \\"the rock\\" you shouldn't be disappointed.
B00CBSYDSE|4.0|Just got into this band, I like the concept.  Catchy riffs and good emotional presence. Not the best transitions to move one along the journey, they're still a young band, hope they stick around a long while.
B00CEF014E|4.0|Horror accelerates from zero to sixty in Solstice. Orphaned at six, Dana struggles with depression exacerbated by her lack of a support system. Dana's only living relative is Zoe, her older estranged sister, married to the leader of a deadly environmentalist commune. Desperate to be loved she heads to Rainbow with Tyler who in reality is party to a chilling end game. On the surface Rainbow and the charismatic Clive seem welcoming and benign but the chills chasing down her spine say otherwise. Lies, sacrifices and murder are par for the course as Dana runs the gauntlet to survival.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What can you hate about the minions?  A lot<br /> of fun for kids of all ages.  Especially because it's free.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved the book and the message. I would recommend it as a book to read or a book to have read to you for anyone from third grade on!  I consider it it an honor to meet the characters.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Was not to sure how I would feel reading it only from the mans perspective, but it was really good.  I laughed a loud. Will read more from this author.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|If you haven't seen this show, you should give it a try.  Witty and sexy and just a lot of fun to watch.
B00B769XB8|1.0|Usually good music saves bad movies but for this case what an awful score.<br />I had to stop the movie after 10mns.<br />It sounds like the composer was well influenced by his master producer, Hans Zimmer.<br />Tired of this annoying clone and tasteless \\"fast food music\\".<br />Explain to me what is the difference between this music and the music you hear all the time in bad<br />action trailers?<br />For me none...
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is very easy to read and full of things that encourage your to pursue your dreams.
B000274THQ|4.0|Funny and sad. the poor kid tried to be a good son. Well done about the end<br /><br />of a stupid government imposed on the people that went from National Socialism<br /><br />to International Socialism.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Well my wife loved it and most women will.  I thought it was okay. My biggest problem is the dialogue that seemed to unscripted and a little lacking.
B005XN0SGU|3.0|I would like more functionality in choosing start-up screen and it hangs pretty often when trying to load the next image in the queue.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie it is so much different t than everything else that is out there. I would re-watch it.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I actually saw this at the theaters and knew I wouldn't be let down. It is an epic movie; I have already hit it up twice more. I would quote some here for you, but I think it best you find the meaning for yourself. :P
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty challenging especially level 10 can't wait til they come out with more levels keep them coming love this game a whole lot
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks! You punch wood, the wood breaks. You can mine trees with  axes, too. Raise your picks high because you can find diamonds. Make some armour at the crafting table. Smelt some iron at the furnace to make a sword. This is an epic game that you can build, craft, mine, smelt, and pound your enemies. It is amazing, all it needs is Redstone like the editions of minecraft. You can use three diamonds and six iron to go to the nether and face zombie pigman. That is minecraft Pocket Edition, the world made out of blocks. I hope you would like to here more because there is. Zombies and skeletons spawn during the night, and they attack. Creepers can spawn any time and blow your mind, literally. I sure hope you enjoyed this extremely long review. Toodles.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead already has a massive cult following, so I won't kill myself trying to promote the show.  Bottom line, this is one of the most interesting, thrilling, frightening, empowering show on TV right now.  The characters are all extremely complex and the writing is awesome.  Period<br /><br />Complaints:<br /><br />-Skulls are made of bone.  Bone is very hard.  A knife, even the hardest, sharpest knife, would have difficulty going through a skull.  The constant &#34;Oh I'll just go around and stab zombies through the top of the head with my swiss army knife&#34; is a little annoying.<br /><br />-Firearms shoot a very small projectile.  A zombie's head is very hard to hit at a distance.  The amount of perfect headshots is also annoying.<br /><br />Still though, I love this show.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|From front to back, this album is amazing, including the Truly Yours 3 EP. This is a classic that I will continue to play when I'm old and gray.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I was hoping to get an app relatively similar to Donkey Kong Country Returns on the Wii. This game is addicting! I play it all the time, and whenenver I'm bored, it's always a fun thing to play. If you're wondering what to do for your kid on a boring rainy day, set 'em up with a device, a snack, and a drink. They'll be ready to go for a while!
B00499NHLC|4.0|It was fun and very entertaining.  I enjoyed the modern story line to the classic characters but still had that nostalgic feel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Occupies spare time and is addictive trust me you'll love it....I did ~newsmagazine n a super creative fun and entertaining game love love  love great great greT
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game with excellent graphics.  Too short though.  Be patient and check all possibilities before resorting to the clues. Waiting for next chapter.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I just truly enjoyed this novel.  I could not put it Dow..  I even took it to work with me, even though I knew I would not have time to read it there:)
B005MMY9A8|4.0|It's somewhat predictable as far as the overall plot like all DC comic based characters are but the actors involved just did a great job making it a very entertaining movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game it is a fun and challenging game but it's not to hard.  You need to have a note pad handy to keep track of everything. It is a great way to pass time if your on a road trip or plane ride! I already made my friends get it they love it too! I can't wait till the new levels come!!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Veteran acting talent and entertaining mystery plot made this a very good movie.  Some very funny lines thrown in with some good old fashioned violence.  I liked the fact that they just used wit and weapons.  It's not really believable when an old guy goes all kung fu on somebody.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I can't find the spell shop to craft gemstone dragons, I've seen lvl 40s with it and I updated my game a day ago. Got new dragons, but no spell shop. Please help! Overall wonderful game indeed!
B009CF7GRY|1.0|This movie should have been re-imagined.  With only a few exceptions this was a direct copy of the original with updates to the dance moves to fit the current time.  In one particularly bad scene where the heroin does this angry dance in the old abandoned warehouse they did almost the same sequence of moves for the actor but used different music which totally didn't fit.  Dennis Quaid and julianne hough were the only bright spots in the movie
0385535147|4.0|I'm a sucker for a John Grisham book.  While nothing that he has written over the past years comes anywhere close to his earliest works, The Racketeer is entertaining and fun and will keep you guessing until the end.  I have to admit that I never saw this plot-twist coming, although you do have to suspend belief as it plays out.<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister is a black lawyer who is serving 10 years at the Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, MD on trumped-up RICO charges.  The former Marine has lost everything including his assets, his law license, his wife, and his son.  With his term halfway over, he spends his days working in the prison library and helping other inmates with legal issues.  When a Federal judge, Raymond Fawcett is murdered (along with his mistress), Bannister claims to know the killer and wants to work a deal with the Feds for his release.  In the weeks after the murders, the FBI has no leads, and they are compelled to deal with Bannister.  When I first started The Racketeer, I thought it seemed too simple, but that feeling didn't last long once this book got cranking.  So maybe the plot is hokey in spots, but it's definitely fast-paced and entertaining.<br /><br />Unlike Grisham's previous books, The Racketeer isn't a legal thriller.  But it is evident that this novel is written by a lawyer, and a jaded one, at that.  \\"Now a trial is a contest in which one side will win and the other side will lose.  Each side expects the other to bend the rules or to cheat, so neither side plays fair.  The truth is lost in the melee.\\"  Bannister's two older black partners \\"fought some of the last battles of the Jim Crow era.  Judges sometimes ignored them in court and ruled against them for no sound legal reasons.  Other lawyers were often rude and unprofessional.  The county bar association did not invite them to join.  Clerks sometimes lost their filings.  All-white juries did not believe them.  Worst of all, clients did not hire them.  Black clients.\\"  I wonder how much of this is still happening in rural (i.e. white) America.<br /><br />I just finished this book in the sweltering heat of summer.  I can't think of a better way to get through these miserable temperatures than by staying some place cool and leaving yourself an uninterrupted chunk of time to read The Racketeer.  Once you start, you're not going to want to put it down.r how much of this is still happening in rural (i.e. white) America.<br /><br />I just finished this book in the sweltering heat of summer.

B004SDSSFY|5.0|I recommend it. Work great. Nice to have this app when there hardly any other app to work with. Nice
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|If I am going to invest two hours in a movie, I hope to be entertained and challenged a bit, and Side Effects does both. The movie is set up in two distinct parts, and though the twists and turns are not so convoluted as to confound, the premise works as intended.<br /><br />Overall, the acting holds up, and this glimpse inside the worlds of therapy, big pharma, and scheming among the wealthy urban set proves just captivating enough to keep one interested.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I recommended it. Nice program to have when other app does't work like this one. Keep up the good works.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was a great family mystery that was difficult to put down. The details of the story help you to work with Laurel in solving the mystery of her mother's history. I highly recommend this book to lovers of England, family history, and war- time romances and friendships.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I believe Neil Gaiman could have done better. It was okay but not as in depth or complicated as his other books. It was too simple. I would recommend this to high schoolers and middle schoolers (or other people who have a harder time grasping books) I am disappointed that there wasn't more to things. Gaiman is usually really good with giving details that later shows a lot, making you want to re-read them. I feel like I saw the ending entirely too early, and I am usually bad with guessing. It didn't feel like when I read it, I went to Gaiman's magical world. Just a story.<br />So worth reading, but wouldn't buy the hard copy for life.
1452113432|1.0|Oh, excuse me while I run out and find my financier pan to make the pastries known as financiers.  Huh?  Really?  You call this a book for an American audience?  The translator from British to Americanisms did a great job, but this book is just for show.  Got any Quark in your fridge?  Didn't think so.  Every other recipe uses Comte cheese.  Huh?  Really?  Where does one buy veal belly or lardons?  A little bit of onion with your creme brulee (yecchhh)?  How about some Toulouse sausage -- that's gotta be a special order.  She uses many French words for things.  I speak a little French, so that's OK with me, but not everyone does.  Every other page is a photo of the author.  Narcissistic much?  This book DOES capture French cooking.  And I DID dog-ear a couple of recipes -- chocolate mousse and chicken with dumplings (the chicken is IN the dumplings, brilliant!) in a light broth.  But do I recommend this book? No.  Get it out of the library, maybe, put it on your coffee table, impress your friends.  But buy it? No.  And cook from it?  Never.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I just was not interested in getting the emails so often.  It was not for me.  I do some crafts but not many.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|It was kinda predictable  even a bit stretched in the end.  But overall a funny movie that I enjoyed watching.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My son loved this book. He flew through it and is now on book 3 of the series. I would recommend it to any kid 3rd grade and up.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|It took nice picture but it Don,t let. You see the pictures that you  took . I tried to view the pictures I took but I can't find them anywhere.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I can run Batman Arkham City on full high quality settings. I'm just using an Nvidia 550ti too! Definitely worth the money for this little sucker. I have it on a Mini-ITX board in a smaller case, so it looks fantastic.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|This movie will never be equalled. This and the Donner cut of 2 are by far the best Superman movies fans will ever see. Christopher Reeve is the ultimate and the simple act of putting a comic related product together in it's purest form set these films light years ahead of \\"modern\\" translated comic films. Story lines may be taken in new directions but as far as acting and soul we've already seen the best in its purest form
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is a worthy successor of pillars of the earth. All characters are well defined, evil as well as good. They all are actors in a world slowly dying and the dawn of a new one. What is fascinating is how the wheel of fortune turns and exalts some while crushing others. As with my previous Follett's reads I could do without the gratuitous sex scenes, but these concerns are minor compared with the magnitude of this work. A must read!
B004LROUNG|4.0|A good look into how lawyers and the justice system works mixed with humor and a good story line.  The characters in the story come to life and are easy to picture.
0812993292|5.0|Being British but living in America for 30 plus years, I am always looking for interesting books for my Book Club.  This one fit perfectly starting off in the part of England where my sister and mother still live.  Harold Fry receives a letter from an ex-colleague who is dying and he believes he owes her an debt of gratitude.  He scribbles a note and hurries to the postbox to mail it, but decides to walk past that to the post office.  Then past the post office and on and on.  He decides along the way he must walk all the way to where his friend is dying in the north of England - a long, long walk.  He believes he can save her by walking all the way and this is how he will repay the debt.  Along the way he reminisces about his own life and marriage and meets some remarkable people as well.  It's just a lovely, human story and I really enjoyed it.  I hope my book club does too.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I just started watching this show, I've seen all of the 5th season and part of the 6th on TV, but I'm catching up on seasons 1-4 and its awesome
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The author sums up at the end, I think very abruptly, why this book highlights Kings Landing and its characters more than the other characters, like  Dany, Tyrion and Jon Snow etc whom we've come to expect to hear about on a regular basis.  I would have preferred the explanation at the get go with a little more eloquence. Other than that, it was a page turner and very eventful, especially in the lives of Brienne and Cersei. I really thought there was a poignant viewpoint described by the traveling Scepton (in a Brienne chapter) concerning the &#34;Broken Men of War&#34; which defined the difference between the lords and Kings who initiate the Game of Thrones versus the Small Folk who fight for them and die (or get PTSD) and &#34;break.&#34;<br />I am looking forward to the Dragon's return.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Probably one of the best Music Albums of all times. Even if you don't know who Paul Simon is, this music will lighten your day.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|i want it like mincraft. it cant change the person. and you cant play with other people. update this app please?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|(Caveat: I do not watch TV.) Three seasons in one Kindle download. At first I was haughty and said, \\"oh, this is just a soap opera\\". However, many of the personalities are well-developed. A couple of the actors matured with depth from season one to three. The variety in the house staff is meaningful psychologically....from plain to subtle to forthright. Among them there are those who are committed to protocol and tradition in a judicious way. Wisdom in decisions affecting fellow men is made real.Even among the mean-spirited there is a ripening into appreciation of letting \\"it\\" be;, honesty, and kindness,  The series spans 1912 to the Roaring 20's so there is a full array of the changes in women's fashion and motor cars as well as the role of women and estates per se. And, of course, Maggie Smith undoes predictability.<br /><br />the last scene of Season 3's last episode seems weird, gratuitous?<br /><br />Finally, I still do not watch TV. TV is not comparable to watching a story unfold (like turning pages in a picture book) in one's lap on a Kindle Fire...the machine disappears. I am also doing a book of bridge problems on the Kindle, again the proximity is like a workbook.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not so daunting you quit in frustration...but challenging enough to keep you interested.  Thoroughly enjoyed playing each and every puzzle.
0062238868|2.0|#1. Just not that interesting. A rambling, plotless collection of experiences each echoing the last. The book should honestly be a short 100 pages at the most.<br />#2. The most offensive brand of small minded, war mongering, red necked, arrogant patriotism I have ever seen exemplified in print. We get it - you think you could have done every single thing better. You hate &#34;the savages&#34; as is stated constantly. The word(s) bad ass is used every two pages.<br /><br />Honestly - save yourself the headache and go play call of duty. Then go to a gun store and listen to the guys that spend all their free time there. You just got the full experience.
B00001OH7P|5.0|It reminds me of my Album, (that disappeared?) from college and we would Jack the Volume Up so everyone in the Fraternity could here Ziggy Play that Guitar...I played it to get psych. up for Football Game ( Fraternity Intramural Football ).We had a-lot of fun -just glad I graduated. It was 1979 and I was the House's D.J. which was great ! The Sorority woman were HOT and liked what I played, especially &#34;ZIGGY STARDUST&#34;. I would recommend this CD which is re-mastered from original tapes & Sounds great!! and hope you enjoy it. Great price from Amazon.com.<br />Thank You,<br />Elliot N. Herzel<br />Birmingham, Alabama
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|I just enjoyed this movie a lot!  It was a great movie to watch, especially on a rainy day!  I would recommend it, and if you like to see the male anatomy, well Michael Fassbender, really does strut it!  That is why it is rated, 'NC 17', No one under 17 admitted to watch!  Enjoy :)
0470932139|5.0|I have been searching for information regarding product photography. While this book focuses on food photography it's exactly what I need to accomplish taking picture of our products. Thank you Helene for this amazing book. I refer to it all the time!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Pretty long and sweet I got addicted to it first time I read if u like to pass the time get this
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story line that keeps evolving, twisting, and moving along history. Wonderful character development over the 3 seasons and believably so. It is easy to care about many of the characters; the villains show both good and bad traits so are not one-dimensional. The &#34;good&#34; characters make bad decisions and learn to live with the consequences. Beautifully written and photographed.
B0067R0APK|2.0|How long does it take to fix the freaking radar map? They replied to me months ago that they were aware of the problem, and... nothing.
B004VMX5TQ|5.0|This is a great collection of Bob Seger's music. I definitely recommend it to all Seger fans, you won't be disappointed.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I bought this book with some trepidation. Would it be a melodramatic, poorly written sob story, or worth he read. Happily, it was the latter . Christina is a master at character development. Both Victoria and Molly are sympathetically and honestly drawn. No excuses, no embellishment , just real. The story line is developed in a point / counterpoint fashion; half from Molly's point of view and half from Victoria's. A half century spans the two  protagonists, but the emotional nuances are the same. A happy ending in this book (and there is one ) is a triumph for both the characters. Sometimes the &#34;good guys&#34; do win.....
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have it on ALL of my devices & computers; I absolutely love that they are ALL synced! Recommend to everyone!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|pretty colors. keeps my busy. daily tasks to earn more points/ algae, pearls, experience. The only thing that I do NOT LIKE about this app is that if you are harvesting the algae and sand dollars really quickly and a treasure chest appears and you accidentally tap twice very quickly on this chest it will TAKE PEARLS away from you!!! I refuse to purchase any pearls or whatever from this thing. Too easy to lose them.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Glad i finished the last and final book!  very happy with the out come! Wish I would have finished it sooner!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It's so hard to get the hair how you want it. I am only giving this one star. I think you shouldn't get it
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I like action films and most of what Tom Cruise does.  I thought most of the movie was entertaining and I like the story line.  I felt the ending was a little weak with the last fight scene.  Throughout the movie Reacher is described as a very smart and disciplined investigator.  The fight scene was not on parr with his character.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Sigur Ros has grown as a musical powerhouse over the years. They've definitely broadened their audience by tweaking their sound a bit with each album. Although Kveikur may be a little darker and more upbeat than their earlier works, it is no less a Sigur Ros album. And like all Sigur Ros albums, there's hardly a bad thing to say about it. It may not rely as heavily on the bells and the mystical charm that may have captivated listeners in the past, but it still pulls you in with the deep bass and the heavy drums, and won't let you go until the final drum sounds.The album, along with its cover, seems like a testament to our nightmares. But, those nightmares can be as much a joy to listen to as anything else. So, I would recommend this  album to anyone that is familiar with the name of Sigur Ros, and even if you're not, I would still give it a try. It's really hard not to find something fascinating about this group and their work.
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|Text in the app is not rendered completely. I have to guess meanings.<br />I couldn’t finish the first mission. It’s too sensitive.
B003X73QA8|5.0|From the catchy intro of The Suburbs down to the final beat of its continuing tune, The Suburbs tells a story very close to many of our hearts. Its a story of growing up and feeling like you somehow lost a part of yourself. That thing you loved when you were a kid. That friend from down the street. The family member who never comes around anymore. We all have something that we once loved that's gone and we all have a growing up story. As painful as the process might be, we all have to grow up eventually. But, by the time we stop and look back at the past, we find that we really aren't that far off from where we started. There's a little part of us that can't be lost, even as everything around us is shifting.<br /><br />The album is a great complete work. It's not just a collection of songs that sound great, it really is a complete work. Each song seamlessly blends into the next and the lyrics and the melodies seem to fade right into each other. It truly is a complete listening experience and it definitely deserved the Grammy it one in 2010. Even if you just like one or two songs, listen to the whole album. You're missing out if you don't.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it wont let me connect to facebook and needs to be UPDATED cause my stepbrothers ipod has more content and mine doesn't :-(
B004SDEP38|1.0|I have used Docs to Go on Palm and ios for years and have loved it. When I picked up my nexus I instinctively picked it up for android and was horribly disappointed. The interface is klunky, opening up docs from my google drive failed, and finding my docs was a nightmare. I returned it.<br /><br />When Amazon offered the unlocked version for free I figured I'd give it another shot, same results. DataViz makes some excellent products - this isn't one of them.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|Everyone dogged this movie way too much. I think it has to do with a lack of patience. This movie is epic, I mean epicly sized epic. You need to be patient, sit down and watch this whole film. Give it a chance. I really enjoyed it. Everything is great - acting, cinematography, music, story - it's just too large for some people.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|Great album that from start to finish is plain GREAT! Gilmour did a fab job with the album which is quite obvious.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the best game ever it just takes a long time to download and you can not play without Internet :(
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cannot wait for season 4.  why do we have to wait so long for the next season?  The actors are all very good .
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this uno the kindle edition isn't this good glad that u can play with friends from Facebook and its so much faster then the kindle uno
B008602KQI|4.0|A good film to watch, Jennifer is delicious.. good imaging and story.. out of 10 I would give it a 7.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This was my first Robert Glasper experience and I'm so happy I decided to indulge, I absolutely enjoy listening to this album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best mobile game out there. If you love. Building things and exploring this is your game. Minecraft pocket edition is better than the tiger woods is better than the tiger woods.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!!! I could play for hours!!! I can't wait for you to add more rooms and I hope they come out really soon!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Bought it for a new build and it's going great. I strongly recommend this product. Really good price too. :)
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|This has been a long time coming, a conclusion to the enveloping stories of many enthralling characters.  And, an open door for someone (Sanderson?) to imagine and share the world of the fourth age through Rand.  I must voice appreciation for the thoroughness with which each storyline was cleanly crafted to an end; sorrow in some cases and hopeful  fulfillment in others.  This book, this series is an investment in time I will recommend again and again.  True entertainment.
B007EE4XKI|1.0|I had planned to listen to this when driving but found text to speech denied, this was not clearly advertised and I've now sunk money into a book that I will never get the time to read.
B008LCRAC0|5.0|One of, if not the best comedy of all time. Seems like nearly ever episode is a classic. Much cleaner and better than most of today's comedies.
1401937519|4.0|The book is a beautiful recounting of Ms. Moorjani's life leading to a profound spiritual awakening. Any spiritual experience is personal and presented to the receiver according to their need and understanding.  By my understanding, what she has laid out for us is true, but lacking in two respects having to do with the human experience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel was selected for a book club I attend. We could NOT stop talking about it! I don't want to risk any spoilers but it starts slow and has a twist in the middle that will make you never want to put the book down! GREAT read!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I loved this book. I've been fascinated by the man for years & this book allowed me to satiate my curiosity. I would not recommend it to everyone as it is very frank & contains very adult subject matter. Manson hit the nail on the head with the title, that's all I'm gonna say.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this entire series. You are kept guessing at every turn and the characters are wonderfully written! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a very fun game, but sometimes I had trouble logging into my Facebook. I recommend this game. It's fun for kids and even adults ! Everyone will have fun with this game.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I started this series because I was looking for a new read. I continued the series HOPING it would get better (and to see what all the fuss is about). Same story. Teenage girl simply cannot live without &#34;the love of her life&#34;. Seriously. Why couldn't Bella have at least graduated college??
B002N44XSG|4.0|I think it is a great book full of details and the story itself... is just a great experience in reading.
B0015DROBO|2.0|There was way too much unnecessary detail in this story for my taste. I get that in a book like this, you need to create some background to distract the reader from &#34;who-dun-it&#34; but I was so distracted I had to read other books to take breaks from this snooze fest. If you like a more fast paced read, don't choose this one.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|There is a glitch on level 3-1 when I play the level the guy just falls to his death<br />And I try over and over again<br />And it's making me mad because all I can do is play Tue levels I already beat and I can't go on
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book in the series still leaves you wanting more. This series had such a robust story line that even after 3 books, you don't know what to expect and you keep wanting more. Loved the whole series!
B0058YPGP2|5.0|Watched this series on MTV and loved it, but won't buy it till it comes out on blu ray.  Why settle for low quality when it was in HD on tv.  I've fallen into this trap before where you buy the dvd then the blu ray gets released later.  Release it on blu ray or I won't be buying it.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|This was an okay follow up to Something Borrowed. It seems like a forced sequel and not much going on here.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loaded this on a whim while bored aand am now addicted! This game i excellent for keeping you entertained and making you think to solve puzzles to escape each room!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best series to come out in a long time! Great everything- plot, characters, fantasy (but not too far fetched). Love it!
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Yes, that's a very bold statement, but with this being one of the very few albums of 2013 with just about excellent reviews all-around, it definitely lived up to the hype - and then some!<br /><br />I think all us pet-heads knew something amazing and unique in even the PSB world was coming (and judging by the constant sales and moving up in the charts here on Amazon and other outlets, it seems the public overall is catching on and finally NOT labeling them as an '80's act (wake-up Pandora!).<br /><br />I remember listening to 'Axis' for the first time as a teaser, then it was followed up with 'Vocal' and teasers for 'Inside A Dream' and 'Fluorescent' (the latter of which I didn't care for at first, but then it turned out to be my most fave song on the album) - releasing these songs as both singles and teasers was the perfect way to market their stuff BEFORE the release of their album helped tremendously with the build-up!<br /><br />Parting ways with Parlophone, the inclusion of Stuart Price, or (what has been stated/assumed by Tennant on occasion) a negative fan reaction from 'Elysium' (a stellar album!) - there were many stated/ironic situations that led to the making of this awesome album - and in less than a year!  This is genius at work and to think: it's the FIRST in a THREE-PART collection - WOW!<br /><br />As I stated in my title, this album has that rare quality: similar to Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours', this has the characteristics of classic written all over it. Every song on here can/could be made into a hit; every song could be known by fans and non-fans alike.  It will be interesting to see how Tennant/Lowe handle this album via their x2 label - they've already broken a good amount of conventional rules upon releasing the album and it looks like it's paying off - maybe they will break more rules and not limit this album to a handful of songs, but possibly a good 3/4 of the album could be made into hits - here's wishing :)<br /><br />Anyway, amazing album: it's been on repeat along with The Editors' 'The Weight of Your Love' (very under-rated), and David Bowie's 'The Next Day' - Haven't loved music this much in a long time - Thanks Chris & Neil :)it's been on repeat along with The Editors' 'The Weight of Your Love' (very under-rated), and David Bowie's 'The Next Day' - Haven't loved music this much in a long time - Thanks Chris & Neil :)
B00BHU2A7I|2.0|I expected more from this movie. It was a bit shallow and didn't really explore the man behind the movies. While the acting was fine, given the caliber of the actors and the material, so much more could have been done.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|More features than a $250 HP programmable calc for $10!  And the help file is BUILT IN, rather than having to connect to the net every time.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|kinda addicting but the background music and the noises the monkeys make is a little too much I think they seem hyper lol
030789701X|5.0|This guide is great! It is very well  bound and easy to use. All the quests are detailed very well. I also liked the interactive map that is included with this guide.There have been a few times when I was stuck in a dungeon or cave, and the guide was great help in getting me through a difficult part of the quest. I have been a big fan of Skyrim for a long time! This game is huge, and I will be using this guide for a long time to come. I would highly recommend this awesome guide to anyone who is having trouble with this epic game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Old friend ...nice to revisit ... an annual read for me... well worth the time invested... the movie versions I have seen and enjoyed, but none compare to the written word.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|I think I'm a pretty harsh critic. I'm constantly listening for new music (in all genres), and while I do of course find music I like, I dismiss most of it as simply poorly composed, uninteresting, and unworthy of its praise.  But every once in a while, I find something special, some artist or band who just \\"has it\\", and Ghost are one of those bands.  There's nothing like that feeling of discovery, and here it came 45 seconds into track 1 when the lead guitar melody kicked in.  I was like, Whoa, whoa, we have something here...<br /><br />And further listening confirmed that, whatever genre you put them in (I'm calling it retro prog-metal), these guys are craftsmen.  These are wonderfully constructed songs, with great catchy melodies, musicianship, excellent harmonies, great texture and layering of the instrumentation... I mean parts of this record are just flat-out beautiful, there's no other way to put it. In a way, it's a shame about their whole \\"theme\\", because it means that a lot of people will be instantly scared off and never listen to them, assuming it's something horrible!  Don't be!!!  Personally, I find the theme to be a fun shtick.  The lyrics are quite interesting and clever and I enjoy their whole gimmick a lot.  But honestly, it doesn't even matter, these guys just write amazing songs!  For my money, songs 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 are near perfect.  If you're going to check out one song first, I'd recommend starting with Ghuleh/Zombie Queen, as not only is it the longest one but it really captures everything they do so well.  Can't wait to hear more from this exceptional band!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Wonderful new way to keep tabs on the weather! Checking the weather is like putting on my watch. I would not go out of the house without doing either one!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the game is like Crack im hooked crack crack white poerrdery crack the kind you get the allys and stuff like that
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Very good read I couldn't put it down. It drew me in from the start and held me captive to the very end.  When is the next part being released
B00BX8PG5M|3.0|Great cast...suspenseful script. Not quite deserving of 4 stars but still entertaining. I'm curious why none of the Russian crew had a Russian accent even though dialogue was in English. Was hoping for more detail. Soviet sub films not easy to pull off credibly. But I did watch it twice and I rarely watch a movie twice.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This movie was fantastic for all ages.  The Broadway play that was based on this movie was probably one of the most creative works I've seen.  The movie was fun and carried a great message.  I bought this as a gift & highly recommend to all
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|Brilliantly written, with twists and turns that will keep you intrigued from the very first page.<br />Immediately, I found my jaw clenched with the terror and the want for salvation, from he who gave her the name, Delicate Rose.<br />So intense and descriptive were the words upon the pages of Simon O'Kill's Luna Sanguis, that I dared not put it down, as it captured my every imaginative thought.<br />A story of violent horror and dismay, of dizzy desires, of anxious confusion and the longing for escape, as Count Lucian continued to scour and kill any who stood in his way to finding his Delicate Rose, also known within her tormented mind, as the lustful and innocent Eternal.<br />Within the heart wrenching terror, I also found a conflicting story of warmth and love.<br />Their thirst for blood is unfathomable, and stops for none. His desirable hunger to find his Delicate Rose of pure blood forever runs strong and deep.<br />This is a story that shall keep the questions invoked within, and have you put in a place of \\"I need to know!\\" \\"I must read on!\\"<br /><br />My heart it bled for Delicate Rose.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Outer case is smooth, easy access to purse/pocket. Inner case is flexible and feels like ample protection for average user.  I like the slim case, feels better in my hand than the bulkier models.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|This goes down as one of the better movies of late. Great acting, fantastic storyline. It's a stand alone movie. You don't need to see the others to appreciate this one.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A very entertaining game, easy to figure it out, the effects and sound are good! It's a really good game to take your boring mood away......
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is one of the best book/ series I have ever read. Once you read the book, you can't get out of it
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Great for those  spilled crumbs, at the front door for tracked in dirt,  and around the dinner table.  I use it a LOT.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game it is very creative and fun one of the best mystery games it is amazing!!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|If you like Phantom, and who doesn't, then you are going to love this live production.  It is grander than most and has a few special features you won't find elsewhere, such as the reunion of the Phantoms through the years.  Lovely performance.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game a lot. It sometimes freezes and takes a while to load. Other then that it is a great game. Fun for all ages!
B008UZ7MUI|5.0|The great end story you already know is expertly done in 3D... almost without any effort.  You don;t worry about the effects, you just enjoy the movie a little bit more.
B00005QEO2|4.0|Would recomend this to any areo fan great album and wondeful songs. a great listen for people of the genra
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|You have to appreciate what old age brings, especially when there is a lot of talent in your past life... knowing that, this is a story that works on almost every level.  It is clear that the cast loved doing it.  You will love it, too.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|Not sure how long these will be available but worth getting, a defenat diferent stylist like Janis Joplin and distinct sound and style !!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It's not a very thought-provoking or character-building movie, but it is really entertaining and the group of personalities really made it fun to watch. The music is really great and catchy that I actually got the soundtrack. I really didn't expect much from this movie, but I ended up completely enjoing it and having to watch it again (maybe a couple of times more :)).
B0041CGOZS|4.0|Can't miss with a group that has made hit music for 30 yrs, Just saw them in Chicago and still putting on a great and entertaining show !!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|It is a little far-fetched and probably not very historically accurate, but gets you rooting for the underdog and happy when the bad guys get what they deserve.  Go into this movie for purely the entertainment factor.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|Can't miss with them and Stevie,, the old fashion rock before the words and music weren't just noise,,, Love everything about them
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|When I first heard this was going to be released, I thought this cd was going to make me fall in love with it, being a fan of his music for years I try to listening to everything Bowie releases. Unfortunately I am little depressed by this one. I found it to be a dark and depressing cd. It talks about a tyrant and how everyone wants to kill him, a high school kid on the verge of taking everyone's life at his school, innocent young men about to be drafted for a war they don't want any part of, and one song mentions about a stalker or a undercover spy from the words of it. There's only a couple of songs that I can say I can actually enjoyed on this, and I'm only giving it three stars. But all in all I do not get a thrill by listening to this album.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|Changes the resolution of your screen.  You can't even access it without client.  What happens when you don't have your phone and need to use your computer?  Did anyone think about web access?  Use Logmein instead.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Great !  love Jesse Stone series.  Prompt delivery by Seller and in new condition.  Highly recommend entire series of these TV shows.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie contains a lot.  We have an enduring love story, a child prodigy, street children, orphans, musicians, and a little tension thrown in as you get to what you believe will be the expected ending.<br /><br />Wrong side of the tracks meets sophisticated cello player...(one caution is the immediate sleeping together but no nudity or sexual act involved.  Some cursing).<br /><br />Robin Williams successfully plays the street hustler you want to like and hate at the same time.  Good acting, good storyline, great music, I think all will thoroughly enjoy.
B0081BU42O|5.0|great read, my first of Banks books, it will not be the last by any means, and I'm telling all my friends.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Still remember every act even of requesting .Robert Redford .A master of all.<br />Love,Dream.A moving rare love from one side
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a really good book and I really like it😄😃😀😊😉💛💙💜💚❤💗💓💖. Ideally like it . It's awesome. It's excellent. Gorgeous to.
B004CR5TD0|4.0|Maybe for me I need to years again to re listen because I thought it might be like the other album
B004KPLVW2|4.0|TRON is a classic. This is a wonderful movie that, due to the technology of the time, was never able to fully realize its potential as a story. I sincerely wish that TRON: Legacy had instead been a reboot of TRON, with a couple of films and/or television series that followed.<br /><br />But I do not get what I want in this area very much. And I still have the classic, so all is good with the universe.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|His music are briliant,calm,sweet,relaxing.<br />New way for me to listen.Just love it.it`s summer time & its good to hear such songs
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game, especially if you have patience. I've been casually playing it for months now &amp; still enjoy it. Not necessary to purchase anything, though it will be slow-going.
B00BXUG0KU|3.0|I love Eliane Elias as a performer and Chet Baker as a performer and for the songs he chose.  Really enjoyed listening to the first track.  It was everything I hoped for.  Then every other song for the remainder of the album had virtually the same arrangement.  The music and lyrics changed, but very little else.  A Tribute of Chet Baker by Eliane Elias was a great idea.  Unfortunately the album was not executed up to Elias' usual standards.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I had heard much about Vonnegut, the man, the legend, and I have to admit that he met and even surpassed my expectations. This book had everything you want from a story: tragedy, witty humour and an ironic turn of phrase after almost every line. So it goes.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is an amazing story but be forewarned the descriptions of physical and emotional abuse in the orphanage are graphic.
B00CISC2DA|3.0|I did not enjoy this album as much as their earlier albums. The tunes are not as catchy. I became bored while listening to it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I love this movie and highly recommend it. Its one of my all time favorites and Im not entirely sure I can verbalize why. Something about the mood combined with the bunny and the troubled kid trying to sort things out. Ive decided trying to make sense of every tiny detail is pointless, I just enjoy it for what it is.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|(This review is for the regular DVD format version.)  I was nervous about buying this because of all the complaints in other reviews about the video quality. But my whole family loves Daft Punk, and the DVD is on sale, so I risked it.  We are completely happy with this DVD.  The animation is absolutely beautiful; the kind of hand-drawn, Japanese-style technique that I grew up with in the 70's. The colors are bright and vivid, and we have no complaints at all. It is a pleasure to watch.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Disney movie of all time. However, when compared to other Disney purchases I've made, the quality is quite subpar. It looks like the same picture quality from when I watched it as a child and looks out of place on a HD TV. Although this doesn't take away from the storyline of the movie (my daughter still loves it), it's just an overall disappointing component.    EDIT: Please see below comments. I stand corrected; it was an error in technology match-ups.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it and was very excited to find access to it through Amazon Prime:)<br />It wasn't available through my NetFlix membership and I thought I was going to have to go to Target<br />and buy it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it reminds me of granny run but a little harder it gets very challenging at times
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cool app made for kids if it was violence kids will not get it but you chose nonviolence for kids
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is such an awesome game.The graphics are amazing and they never blur.It also doesn't lag and is a great interactive game.A must have for horse lovers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun and its not just when you have your own town there are games and its an awesome GAME!!!
B004XZR63M|5.0|&#34;Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't.&#34; - Truer words have never been said.<br /><br />This book grabbed and held my attention from beginning to end! After reading this book, I now have a whole new way of way of thinking where my finances are concerned. This book actually gave me the push I needed to start investing, and planning for my early retirement. I have to say a HUGE thanks to Mr. Kiyosaki for leading me out into the light, as it seems I was perhaps living in an abyss. The poor, middle class and wealthy balance sheets were very sobering, as was the story of the 9 financiers. I have, and will continue to recommend this book to just about everyone. A MUST read!<br /><br />&#34;If money is smarter than you, you will work for it all your life.&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great, so much fun! Can't put it down, I even sneak in time at work to play.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great series of books!!!  Can't wait till the next book comes out.  Surprises in this one.  Each chapter has you on edge wanting more.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is fun but bothers me that it doesn't always allow me to purchase special animals or decorations that are only available for brief times. It also takes away hearts from my tree for no reason not allowing it to grow. I plan on continuing to play and hope the faults are corrected
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It works great between computer and phone. Would recommend it to others. Even to family and friends and coworkers and people i don't know.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I have this app, and it lets me write what I want. I love being able to add words to the Dictionary, since I write stories on FanFic, and they stay in the Dictionary. Some words like &quot;learned&quot; and &quot;practiced&quot; makes me a bit worried, since they should already be known. The corrected words make me a little annoyed, since they have noting to do with what I wrote. It is fine, but it glitches after a while. I was writing to my story, and it turns out when nothing appears on the screen and the Keyboard disappears, you won't write normally. You can still write the word, but in order to see if after the keyboard vanished you have to tap somewhere else. I love being able to delete my stories (journals) when I don't like it. It's really good, but could be better.
B0094M4R3Q|1.0|This was way stupid and very slow.  We kept thinking it would get better, but it never did.  Pass on this one.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|the case is quite shallow, you can't really fit in a lot of wipes.<br /><br />my son was playing with the red cover and it broke after 1 day.<br /><br />a waste of my money. should have read the other reviews before buying this.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Science fiction has never been my first choice genre. However, I have stumbled upon some outstanding writing in this field as my choices have been pared down in thrillers and mysteries. I depended on others' reviews to help steer me and chanced upon Patrick Rothfuss. I needed to find an author before moving overseas and adding additional titles to my Kindle, and that is exactly what happened. I immediately downloaded \\"The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day 2\\" upon completion of this book.<br /><br />The story is not terribly fanciful. There is a bit of magic here and there. The world in which the story takes place sounds like Medieval Europe. It is the intricate interplay of the characters that is the ultimate success of the story. The drama of their lives as the story unfolds is like a magnet that pulls you in until you do not want to stop turning the pages. I give Rothfuss as much credit for his uncanny ability with the turn of a phrase as I do his imaginative storyline. I respect and appreciate good writing, and \\"The Name of the Wind\\" has that going for it. It is not mindless reading recreation as much as it is creatively stimulating. I think you will like it, too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy games like this. The puzzles are short enough that you can easily play through a couple of them on your break and then put the game down until later.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I can't wait to see season 2 - when will it be available - acting and storyline are the best
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Every time I start a new season of Game of Thrones, I can't stop watching each episode until I'm finished.  The second season was no exception.  Can't wait for the 3rd.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God bless you all. Jesus be with you if you get this because learning and loving God is a special way to keep God and keep gods work. if you love your kindle and you love God. this is the app for you......amen! Lol :D
B0087ZFHBM|5.0|I am a big fan of Mike Oldfield, and QE2 is my favorite album of his. I misplaced my CD years ago, and all I had was a digital (MP3) copy, so I when I saw this was coming out in a remastered edition, I just had to have it. And I couldn't be happier with it. The extra songs are great, too, especially Shiva.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoy cracking the codes and completing the puzzles to escape the rooms in this game! Can't wait for more rooms!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The writing is superb - without a great story, even though this one has its preposterous aspects, no amount of good directing and acting could prevail.
0525952926|3.0|The first book wa samazing, almost at a level with Pillars of the Earth. This one just falls short: the characters are almost lifeless and there is very little substantial historical information. Whereas in Fall of Giants the reader was given an insight into personal and social motivations, here you are faced with the historical event and no explanation is given other than the Nazis were evil (which off course they were, but it would be interesting to see Hitler's rise to power and why German society accompanied him). Halfway through the novel some of the character's stories just take turns that are completely unbeleivable and sum up the worst of soap opera romance and clichés.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|It takes a while for the cast to figure out their characters and be comfortable playing their parts. It's odd to see Spock flirt and smile in a very unvulcan like manner in the first few episodes.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As a male reader I was constantly rooting for the husband to free himself from the web of deception spun by the wife.  Female readers could just as easily cheer for the wife to succeed in her plot.  The alternating perspectives by which the story is told keeps both reader genders engrossed.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Having been a Loyd-Webber fan since 1988, I can find no fault with this production.  The artists were well chosen, the program true to the Phantom.  I loved it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|start was confusing because first chapter was just a black screen with the music playiing. 2nd chapter the normal intro starts...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is a godsend no more do I need to worry if I'll have enough battery life to finish my chapter or even my book this app tells me how long I've got doing various activities on my kindle - brilliant!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|packageing  in good order and the disc appeared o.k. the first two episodes played normally without any problem.  so far so good
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book swept me away for days with vivid pictures of otherworldy events. Made me reflect on the smallness of our being. Touching, yet frightening & thought provoking. Worth the read!
0066620996|2.0|I received the book in about 2 weeks and the lost was great but I did not like it. There where many missing pages and book was written on (several pages).
0316067598|5.0|The only thing wrong with this book is that so many outstanding young men die serving this country. It should be required reading for all 9th graders before they get indoctrinated by their history books.<br /><br />It is well written and a great read. You just wonder where all the Medals of Honor are for these men.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the layout, functional for bright light or dim light. I like the many versions to read/compare. It was also free, which is awesome. I don't notice ads if there are any.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Such an addictive game.  Me and my whole family love this game!  You play by yourself and try to clear the level.  Its fun to see how you stack up against your friends and family.  Sometimes we play where you get 2 tries to clear the board then you hand if off.  SO MUCH FUN!!
B005544V6A|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable show that I am so excited to see return this summer! All of the actors are great and fun to watch.
B005HSL626|5.0|MY and my 3yo love this game!!  You get to use swords to chop up fruit.  There are different ways to play.  Of course you have to buy the full version in order to do certain things and get certain rewards.  But the FREE version is fun enough!
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is the best !!! I feel free to do whatever I want on it. There's nothing better than being able to talk to your friends wherever you are. Sure there is cellphones.. but this is for free.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|If you need a little music and nature sounds to just relax this is the app for you.  You can choose from preselected items or you can make up your own sounds!  Soft winds with rain drops on a tin roof!!
B003GAFA8S|4.0|I bought this movie right away after finding it here on Amazon. Immediately, my husband commented that our oldest son, whom is 11, would love to see this movie. After the first watch, the movie was on our screen repeatedly for the next few weeks. It also brought me memories of when my husband and I first met. I love how we are able to find our Childhood movies and introduce them to our kids.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Who doesn't love a good game of UNO?  Its just like I remember as a kid!  So fun and easy to play that my 3yo plays it and has beaten me a couple of times!
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Great book, I have applied the lessons to both business and personal life.  I was surprised at how effective having a simple checklist was in my personal life.  One particularly valuable aspect of the book was how to come up with a checklist in a situation of high complexity and uncertainty - exactly the place you'd least expect to use a checklist.  The other key learning was how persuasion is a key part of adoption.
080508990X|5.0|This is just what I expect from Eric Carle, great pictures in a sturdy board book that a toddler can handle.  Love the animals which will initiate questions and comments.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|10 years later we meet Yossi again - 34, still closeted (barely) and quite a bit heavier.  He is mired in a morass of his loss - the love of his life, Jagger - and engulfing himself in his work.  There is much to like about this film, but unlike the earlier film, which was shot like a documentary and very honest in its directness of portrayal, both of the love story, and the other relationships of the soldiers, this film is more cinematic, though still staying close to its honest portrayal of the characters.<br />We first see him now as a doctor specializing in the heart.  Then there is his friend and colleague, Moti, played by the excellent Lior Ashkenazy, says 'he looks like an operating table'. Lior's role of supportive friend - enough that he is ready to engage in a 3-way with Yossi in a bar's toilet in order to pull him out of his funk, is one that makes you sit up and say \\"Wow\\" to yourself!!<br />Ohad Knoller has gained a lot of weight for this role, and he carries the gravitas of his loss believably.  He still mourns Jagger.  The scene when he reconnects with Jagger's parents is moving, and provides a believable catalyst for Yossi's escape.  The film tends to move a little slowly in places (for me, as a non-Israeli gay person, the cabaret scenes seemed to be too long and heavy), but the comedic moments are brilliant and touching on the issue of same-sex partners and being a widower was deftly handled.  Also, the sometimes-brutal quality of Jewish directness balances here with Yossi's nearly painful hesitancy and reserve.<br />Also, Oz, the younger 'love interest' is very interesting here.  Yossi offers a ride to a group of young soldiers who missed their bus.  There is nothing 'cruisy' about his action.  Along the way, \\"Tom's\\" openness about his sexuality, his mates' clearly accepting attitude and Yossi's past serious military background all meld as we watch Tom become the pursuer : he senses in Yossi a deeply powerful kindred connection, and his tender yet confident approach with Yossi is believable and masculinely tender - no ageism here from him nor his military friends, who jokingly, and affectionately tag Yossi with the nickname \\"Mozart\\" (an ironic tie back to \\"Jagger\\"?) because of his love of older style music.  If only there were such younger gay men in America!<br />Note : There is some male nudity here (though not 'full frontal'), so if that offends you, be prepared!<br />All-in-all, a film I enjoyed, and wonder if there will be another film 5 or 10 years down the line titled \\"Yossi & Tom\\"?! I would, in all honesty, like to see it.
1607886553|5.0|It had action and a good degree of complexity.  I really like David Balducci, he is one my favorite authors.  My son really likes Stone.
1781162646|5.0|I enjoyed this page turner as it's The Master really telling a good story without having to use 1200+ pages. Don't get me wrong, The Stand, 11-22-63 and Under the Dome are great reads. But sometimes you just need a quick fix from King's mind. This fills the bill.

B0055MBQOM|3.0|For me, the software does what it promises to do. It calibrates my screen, and this is what I am using it for.<br />I am not printing at all, so I cannot comment on the product's performance here.<br />The use of the software is straight forward. It installed properly and had no driver issues on my Windows 7 system.<br /><br />However, the software has its flaws behind the scene; it leaks memory. Support has suggested to reboot the PC daily; I find this advice nonsense at best. If they would care, they would fix the software.<br /><br />The workaround is killing the process in TaskManager, and starting the software again; I do this probably twice a week. My Windows system may need a reboot every 6 weeks. I have 8GB of memory.<br /><br />Good luck with it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Not fully realizing this was a YA novel, I purchased The Fault in our Stars based on a review in EW.  I suppose I might not have read it if I had known this, but I am so very glad I did. A touching and smart love story with wonderful characters, there were some very real moments that momentarily stopped my heart. I shed a few tears, which led me to definitely see the movie emerging from the story. My only recurring thought (and perhaps problem) with the story was that these two teenagers sounded nothing like teenagers. They were far too witty and well read for 16 and 17, but you love them nonetheless.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game to play when you're bored and/or waiting.  Haven't tried any of the timed sessions yet but now that I'm confident will begin trying to beat the time restrictions.  Fun, fun game especially if you're a mahjong fan like me.
B002RI90WM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story written from the point of view of the family dog who sees the owners go through good times and hard moments. The narrative is gripping and pulls you right into the events and the feelings the story teller experiences in relation to them. A heart warming story in itself that will also make you fall (more) in love with the four legged friends.
B001POX73C|5.0|The best-laid plans go right off the rails, as expected, to results unexpected by the characters.  Kitty must choose one of her cousins to marry so their rich uncle will leave them his fortune.  Jack, the one she wants is too proud to play his uncle's game so she enters a false engagement with Cousin Freddy to stir Jack's jealousy and get a London season out of her uncle.  The ending of this one may not be what you expect, but the great characters, hilarious situations and excellent attention to historical detail are all hallmarks of a Heyer regency novel.
B0051UH6W4|5.0|I read this book when I was in high-school. Loved it. The idea of re-reading followed me for over a decade. I read it again and was whipped away once more into the world of love and &#34;little things&#34; of big importance. A beautiful story that will take you straight into another world and move you to tears.
B0041D843M|4.0|This is my first review ever for anything on Amazon. I have made over a hundred purchases. This book reminds of someone who is stubborn and close minded. Someone who omits variables so the results meet his criteria. But I have to say plant based diets are the only way to go to live healthy and have tons of energy.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I got this sleeve together with my kindle. It's easy to use (to open and take the Kindle in and out) and protects the Kindle well. I don't have another sleeve to compare it to, but I'm very happy with this one.
B00A8M7H42|5.0|like the flash and GL artfx I got they are all amazing, the paint job the details and the quality it was made with is just great. even though it is on the pricy side I would buy it all over again if it just came out again.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Very fun reminds me of when I was younger. Love that you can build your own deck. And the. Campaign is pretty intense.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I used to play halo back in the day for probably a few months but then I stopped. Anyways these halo figures created by MCflarlane is a must for anyone who likes toys because the materials used are amazing and much better then most of the toys out there as well as the joints,
0374531269|5.0|This was a great book, and a quick read.  It was very heartwrenching, but also an eye-opening discussion.  I would definitely recommend it!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Did not know what to expect - the whole dirty cop was at first a turn off yet the story lines sucked you in!  Can't help but like the characters and how they took care of &#34;business&#34; each day!
034554398X|5.0|Great trilogy.  Hopefully there will be more SOON!  Just wish more of the characters survived.  If you like strong entertainment . . . pick these up, you won't be able to stop until they're finished
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I kept seeing the previews for this movie, and couldn't wait to see it!  It was a lot different than what I thought it would be, but in a good way!  I was definitely on the edge of my seat the entire time!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has really helped me in school especially when I don't get some equations on my homework!!! LOVE IT
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it so so much fun and funny u get to win prizes and do all sorts of things like change costumes .
B00CWVBV4E|4.0|Good movie that kept my 5 year old entertained.  My son enjoyed playing the video game and the movie follows along the same plot.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I never liked most game unroll I tried this out. Its the best game I've played in a long time
B003O86FMW|5.0|This one is even better than the first  grabs your interest and doesn't let go.  I wasn't ready for it to end!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have been using this app for at least 6 months. This program has satisfied me ever since. I consider about the flexibility. We can both use the available tones, which I barely use, and our own music. I think the useful point of this app is the amount of time we have left until the alarm rings. Sometimes I adjust a little bit longer, for a nap. Just ignore the advertisement, it won't bother you.
B0024CEY36|3.0|I am a HUGE Follett fan, but this wasnt his best. It might be because this was my 19th Follett book,but ut just did not live up to his other work.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|enjoyed reading about the case studies regarding the hot beds.I beieve this information would be very benefcial to a teacher or coach.
B000088E6D|4.0|Awesome remake of a few songs from years gone by. The smooth voice of MB will transport you to better days.
B00873GRU4|3.0|Well it was fun reading this book!! At some point you near the 3/4 of the book, you get a little bored!! But it gives you a nice twist in the end!! That's why the three  stars!! Lets see what the next book will be like!! For sure you will buy it!,
B0046B3QTG|2.0|Maybe the young'uns like this  and maybe I expected something  more clever and maybe we were both disappointed- I know I was
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I tried a number of times to play.  I could get it to down load but when it got the part were it loaded to play it would no load I waited over 30 min.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|Sent in to Gigabyte for repair, returned with the same problem.  The motherboard started to boot very slow.  First found issue, the bios stuck on the bios screen for 20 seconds<br />Second issue came out after 1 year of using, the motherboard loads the OS really reallly slow, slower than a pc in the 80s... the motherboard stuck on the \\"Starting windows\\" for an hour.<br />Checked processor, memory, even changed the hard disk, everything is fine.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Quick, simple to operate and best of all it works! Would recommend to anyone that wants to down load a you tube video for later/off line viewing.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love it! easy to use. Vivid colors. First Mom's game that my son gets to learn and enjoy too
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|I actually saw this show in Pittsburgh.  It was great.  This recording however, it sounds like Mike Love has a cold and can't hit all the right notes.  A little disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use! Large enough that I can see the numbers without my glasses on.  Contains all the functions that I need.
B008J34466|4.0|Just recently discovered Pink.  I like this CD very much.  Would highly recommend.  Even better than I anticipated. Looking for more
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun to play.  I can play for just a couple of minutes or for a long time depending on how much time I have available.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Even though this is not Danny and Rhea's finest performance, they are a hilarious pair. My kids love this movie, and I don't mind watching it with them.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Ok, I used to love this app until I updated it, the new layout absolutely sucks, I hate it, nuff' said.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I'd have given it 5 stars but, I'd like to have a small opened window, for updates. Then I won't have to keep opening the program to receive updates.
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|My opinion is that my muscovys are better than your muscovy.  For communism, for Stalin.  Bob Dylan turkyperson and I apologize for your buck stops in bikinis.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard I've ever used on a mobile device. Between the swiping and word prediction, it saves me a ton of time when trying to type something quickly. Definitely worth the price! Plus you can change the color of the keyboard as well!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is the best alarm clock app I have ever seen. It tells time, wakes you up with multiple choices of sounds, and tells the temperature/weather.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Articles never load.  Tried it along side my android phone.  Individual articles load fine.  Then it'll work fine.  Real buggy for me.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This app is so amazing because for one there are incredibly adorable pets and it is exactly what you have always wanted them to talk to move this is magical and the best part free
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game ever ever evert!!!  you should totaly get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you can do basically do anything 4 free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00425S1H8|5.0|The adapter worked fine out of the box. I had no difficulties whatsoever using it on a laptop running Windows 7.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The game is phenomenal and is complemented by its amazing graphics. On of the best games I've see/played in awhile.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|i don't like magic but i liked this book and i can't wait for the next. i would suggest this for people who like adventure and action
0465043577|5.0|This analysis of the financial markets by one of the brightest minds of the century shjows us tremendous insight into how risk in the markets is chronically under-quantified.
B0055S348W|4.0|Prior to installing PrinterShare, getting acceptable prints from my Android Devices involved transferring the material to a computer, then printing from there. Now I print directly to one of my printers with excellent results. I give it four stars mainly because it does not have drivers for some late model laser printers. However, to their credit, according to their listing, most of the popular printers are usable.
B00DU73T08|2.0|Book was slow and dull, movie was even worse.  I had thought the movie would have improved the book some, but it didn't.  Acting was bad and the story line could of been better; it seems like the movie was a last minute project.  Action, details, explanations just didn't cut it.  I was dissapointed to see Wm Hurt waste his talents here.<br />  A waste of my time on both (I'll blame that on my daughter, tho.  She liked it)!<br />  Please Take Note:  I am not a S. Meyer fan.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|As both a huge Firefly fan and a Nathan Fillian fan back to The Adventures of Briscoe County Jr, I had to have this movie on the best available format. Picture is spectacular, and the sound does not disappoint. The real &#34;wow&#34; moments occur when watching the extras. This disc includes Visual Commentary by cast and crew, Picture in Picture features including interviews, rehearsals, and behind the scenes stuff you can enjoy while watching the film, a digital tour of the Firefly (very cool), and other stuff. A great value considering all the extra stuff that's included.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!  It's so fun and addicting.  I used to play subway surfer, but this is much more fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book many years ago and I still remember it very well. It still is one of the 10 best Sci Fi stories I have ever read. It will be interesting to see if Hollywood can preserve the ruthlessness of the boy in the movie. At the time of publishing there were many school teachers who did not like the book because they felt no little boys could possibly think this way. Obviously they did not grow up in a gang infested neighborhood.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book really sums up the rest of the series. It was very well written and I strongly recommend the entire series.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|After downloading the app, I got into the game.  It was pretty fun figuring out the clues and solving puzzles until I came to the place that needed to be UNLOCKED.  Not happy with this.  Did not know this download was only a teaser.  Will not purchase the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one addictive game so far! Can't stop playing this game!I love the fact that you don't have to wait for more time before you can start a new game!Just click and go again! No waiting for energy to start a new game!Thanks for a great time!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I read a third at a public library and had to finish it, so I downloaded the Kindle version. I am slightly embarrassed at how emotional it made me.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|Fearless. Exploratory. Unapologetic. Visionary. Unsettling. Melodic ( yes, LISTEN!!!) Offering hope for this forsaken music industry. A crazed, underground yet strangely familiar sounding offering from one of the all-time greats of heavy music. So Sayeth The Kid.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is like so fun to do when you are board and it is kind of like temple run 2
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Kristen Stewart I am beginning to think is a one trick pony, appearing to be unable to in body a different persona other than what we have already seen.  As for the plot of this movie, though different in its depiction adding two love interests and the change of the roll of the dwarfs, it is predictable even in its difference from the original animated masterpiece.
B0001VV1GK|3.0|I bought this for Christmas 2012 for my 2 year old son. Was fairly easy to put together and hotwheels and matchbox cars work well, except in the elevator, most cars are too big to fit in it. It is not very sturdy at all. The gas station part is where it gets super wobbly and any kid that leans on it, the thing tips over. Now from regular wear and tear, not even 8 months later, the gas station side base, the screw to hold it together is completely stripped and constantly comes loose. I paid a lot of money for this toy, and was recommended Plan Toys for the durability. I probably will not purchase again. Less than a years use and is now broken. Guess it's time to get out the super glue and pray that is works!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game even more than the movie and I didn't even think that was possible I think it is a great game!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the clues were tough. but overall a fun puzzling game would recommend this. to anyone and all ages<br />needs a lot more levels
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|Great gaphics and sound. I still need to put some  time in to see the replay value. It's not my typical gaming experience and has not drawn me in enough to have me sneaking in games whenever I have a free chance. I would like to give it three and a half stars, but not four.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I lost all my memory so I have to start all over now but its so awesome I don't mind that
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love it have it on my phone and it cleans out old debris or websites etc and makes my phone work faster.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|We really enjoyed the movie but it kept pausing, stopping, and at one point shut off completely. We had to reset our Roku and log back in. But it was a great movie nonetheless.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Good graphics, fun game play. Suitable for all ages. Good replay value. Interesting game objects as well. Would buy this game again...
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Modern Vampires of the City contains Vampire Weekend's most addicting music yet.  While Contra put an emphasis on catchy and unique melodies and cool percussion, this album is more about the addicting beats.  It's more about the light background harmonies that keep you coming back for more.  There are many subtle sounds you may not notice, and you focus on different aspects of the soundscape.  For example, the two-part vocal harmony you'll usually hear.<br /><br />Ezra doesn't do much yodeling and wailing, but he still has a very comforting voice.  There is a good variety among rock instruments, synthesizer sounds, and classic instruments like piano.  But it's never about trying to overwhelm you with a fancy set. You couldn't have a better album to listen to while commuting on the train, because the songs seem to change their mood and even their pace depending on your own existence.<br /><br />The lyrics are less quirky and more emotional than in VW songs.  They tell of bittersweet adventures around the city, and musings about the odd future of someone living well-off and achieved.  There's also a lot of half-guilty atheistic drawling, and personally I think VW is not quite as insightful about religious matters as I think they are.  But then again, the songs make you think a little while still being cool and calming.<br /><br />The CD packaging is pretty nice, with a script-like lyric book and hazy photographs of Manhattan settings.  But it's not exactly a necessity.<br /><br />Overall, this is an album you want to play very often.  These songs are better enjoyed through several frequent listens no matter where you are.  For those new to VW, I recommend Contra instead, because these songs aren't all that fun on the surface.  It's an intelligent development for a band that knows how to use its own potential.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|great afternoon movie,Im not that crazy about the director, to grafic, but i thought this was very well done and LOVE history
0545265355|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this series.  I am usually a slow reader, but I read all three books in one weekend.  It was fun.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I'm a huge fan! And was hugely disappointed. The other books were creative and thought out and the was.. Like &#34;ok, here's one shocker and less adventure... The end.&#34;
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I now know what I am doing. I learned how to aim the bird or birds, so sometimes you will knock all of them down, and sometimes you miss. But it is a fun game.
B004EF6632|5.0|I'm new to these BBC series but I'm loving each one that I watch more and more.<br /><br />I sat down to watch ONE episode of North and South and ended up spending the WHOLE afternoon on the couch. I couldn't just stop at the first one. Such a wonderful story!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have not been this hooked on a program since the early days of Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Breathtaking cinematography of the landscape and the period decor inside! Beautiful music score! Characters believable and most endearing with exceptions!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love Supernatural. I came to the series late but was hooked from the first 5 minutes. Using Amazon instant video on my smart tv allows me to watch episodes I missed from the current season. Easy to use.
B006LSZECO|5.0|An excellent story written by a gifted writer. If you're wondering if you should buy this book, the answer is yes.
B00005JL96|5.0|I absolutely live this movie and would recommend it to anyone who is a Disney lover.  I think this is one of Disney's finest!
B008476HBM|3.0|I had to get this for an english class I'm taking in college and I would have to say this book is rough to read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed  And the Mountains Echoed. Hosseine does a wonderful job of creating real and complex characters and tells a story that engages the reader page after page.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Had to get this for my english class I was taking and it was actually a really good book to read.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|WWII from a different point of view. Characters are real and human with a different setting than the usual WWII books.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I'm biased since I am a hige Lost fan, but I really enjoyed the first season of Fringe.  With it's &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; like quality,eeach week is different from the next.  Admittedly, I'm not big on science knowledge, so I can't comment on whether that aspect of the show is accurate, but I do know that the chemistry between the cast is the best part of the show.  Watch and you'll see.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I have been trying for a week to get this game to download on my kindle. Still not downloading even when I try deleting and reinstalling. I will not purchase anymore games from this company because of this! Don't waste your money or your time!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Awesome game app! Enjoy playing it way too much! Would highly recommend it!  Well done and easy to figure out.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|While the Jack Reacher series will never rise to the 5 star level, Lee Child continues to create new and original twists and turns that keep me going and reaching for the next novel once done. I've read every one of his books through the 14th, and only that last book got less than 4 stars.  I love the character and his way of life. I do wonder what happens after he gets past a certain age, but the plots remain original, the back grounds very realistic, and the plots interesting, if often somewhat predictable once you get into the book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|good running game but I cant get past the friends facebook missions.  good for a free app but wish missions were individual performance based.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The Supernatural saga, continues in season 8 with new plots, twists, and turns that continue to surprise and keep the fans interested and hooked.  While I'd like to see the Leviathan threat dealt with completely, was sorry to see Bobby die, and I'm not sure I like his &#34;replacement,&#34; the series continues to hold my interest and makes me ready for season 9 when it is available.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|It really weirds you out and the beat rocks.  Theme is sci fi which excites me but definately blended with something like rock
B000GCFG7E|4.0|While the Jack Reacher series will never rise to the 5 star level, Lee Child continues to create new and original twists and turns that keep me going and reaching for the next novel once done. I've read every one of his books through the 14th, and only that last book got less than 4 stars.  I love the character and his way of life.

B00D6BQPMM|2.0|Plot was really redundant, but i still can't get over the fact ***spoiler ahead**** that she fell in love with him after she knew that he ate her last long term boyfriend. How does someone get past that?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it a lot and have got my 5 year old to use it to check weather as well. No problems to whine about.  You do I'd a great job putting it together.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so amazing and addicting. Only 10 levels though.... So you get really into the game and go all the way to level 10 and it just stops...... No more levels :( so sad. Please make more levels! It's very  fun!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Fantastically, inspiringly, soulfully moving! Anyone who has ever struggled with life, love or spirituality should delve into this woman's private journey, which she so graciously and humbly shared with the world.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Anyone who is a fan of David Baldacci will enjoy this, an  other Jack Teacher stories!  Lee Child has a goo  grasp of the military loner and the wanting to loss the structure for awhile.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Good movie I like alein movies sci fiction is a good movie subject so this is a movie that had my imagination working ot
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I've read all three books from the Bared To You series and I have to admit that Sylvia Day tries hard to make it similar to 50 Shades of Grey. Unlike 50, however, this third book failed to captivate me. I found myself bored skipping through the love scenes and found the ending to be abrupt and uneventful. This was probably my least favorite of the three.
0156014041|5.0|Bought it as a gift. I don't know Latin, but know the story. Generally it's got pretty illustrations and nice quality overall.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Im very addicted! The competition mode is very realistic! I like being able to buy a lot of tack and other stuff for my horse
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good way to keep kids occupied when I'm out and about.. love this game and so do my kids! Must have app!
B00BZB9UOU|5.0|All four of this series were enjoyable to watch.  Selleck is at his best as the character seems to suit him well.
